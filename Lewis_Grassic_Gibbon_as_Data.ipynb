    "### About the Lewis Grassic Gibbon First Editions Dataset\n",
    "Lewis Grassic Gibbon is an early 20th century Scottish novelist who also published under his birth name, James Leslie Mitchell.  He was an  prolific writer for the short period of time (5 years) that he published fiction and non-fiction, and the NLS collection contains first editions of all his published books.  Gibbon's stories often featured strong central female characters, unusual for an early 20th century writer.  Gibbon's literary influence continues to be felt today: his book A Sunset Song was voted Scotland's favorite novel in 2016, and contemporary Scottish writers such as Ali Smith and E.L. Kennedy have noted Gibbon's influence on their own writing.\n",

If we wanted to focus on the people Scots, we could look for instances of Scots being used as an adjective.  This method wouldn't return perfect results, though.
