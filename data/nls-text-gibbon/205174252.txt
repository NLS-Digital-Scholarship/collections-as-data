I
“To Sail Beyond the Sunset”
Of our bleaker earth-world lying
between the ice-belts of ten thousand
years ago it is probable that scarcely
a square mile remained untrodden by
men. But of geographical exploration,
of deliberate adventuring into the
unknown for the purpose of appre¬
hending the facts of the earth’s surface,
there was none, for men had not yet
invented an alphabet.
Man’s ancestral terrestrial home is
still in dispute. But the proofs are
[9]
HANNO
conclusive enough. It was South
America. That most anthropologists
disregard the proofs because of the
fact that ancient Asia Minor—with
suburban amenities of good water,
gravel soil, and timber near at hand—
would have provided a much more
suitable base for the greatest adventure
of pre-history, is merely evidence of
the weight of the Judaic traditions.
It is improbable that Mr. Shaw’s
Life Force, unadvised by Professor
Elliott Smith, displayed half the fore¬
thought credited to it.
Since remote Pliocene times, six
hundred thousand years before Christ,
when the first ancestral ape-clans,
originating on the southern fringes of
the great Brazilian forests, spread
slowly up through the Pacific lands,
hung and drifted and developed and
differentiated, then sprayed out north,
west, east, and south again, innumer-
[ro]
FUTURE OF EXPLORATION
able tribes have marched and counter¬
marched in the trail of pioneering
adventurers. But few of these early
pioneers were explorers. They were
hungry apemen, prowling pithecan¬
thropi, low-browed Aryan stragglers
beyond the Ural walls, enemy-pressed,
outlawed, berry-seekers and searchers
after succulent foods and free wives.
Their curiosity concerning the unknown
lacked impersonality. The Neander-
thaler prowling up wild canyons of
France, where, two hundred thousand
years later, descendants of his own
conqueror were to indulge in an orgy
of Neanderthaloid brutishness, was no
explorer. He was unamazed by
glimpsed mountains and stirred by
no desire to test the touchability of
the horizon.
One stresses in the explorer’s mental
equipment that half-unreasoning
dream-pursuit, that aching wonder,
[ii]
HANNO
that nameless urge. In the crinkled
leaves of pre-Christian history, in the
dim records of kings and courtesans,
raids and rapines, wars and widowings,
the tale of Hanno’s voyage is read wh h
a sense of shock. For Hanno, “ King
of the Karchedonians,” sailing with
five small vessels to plant new trading
stations on the Moroccan coast, and
passing beyond the Straits of Gibraltar,
was seized with an Unpunic madness.
He did not stop at planting trading
stations; he sailed still southwards,
into stench and heat and a glassiness
of ocean, out of the light of security
and the known into a wild and
terrifying dream. He could have hoped
to plant no further trading posts;
he could have hoped for no prize of the
seas or loot of the coasts ; southwards
was hell and the world’s end.
And still southwards sailed the ships.
To the right a dark shore of menacing
[12]
FUTURE OF EXPLORATION
forests looped and wound. The heat
grew; with the falling of night the
shores in darkness boomed with drums
and the chanting of devils ; one night,
looking from their little ships, they
saw a red light grow to brilliance across
the forests: all that night it grew
and shuddered upon the horizon. By
next morning they saw that the forests
were on fire. Their passage lit at day
by a sun ever more overpowering, at
night by the infernal glare of the shore,
they still sailed southwards. And
ever as they sailed out of the red-lit
forests boomed the drums.
It is a story in a dream. Somewhere
down the reaches of that wild coast
they turned back, away from the fires
and the reddened rivers, the booming
nights and the unknown voices. Some¬
where in that voyage they over¬
reasoned or overpowered the mad
admiral. They fled back north again,
[13]
HANNO
and after long voyaging came to
Carthage and hung in the temple of
Ashtaroth the skins of men-brutes
captured on an island within an island.
Hanno, the mad admiral, sailing
south over the rim of the world,
leaving far behind, lost beyond the
Pillars of Hercules, the friendly gods,
strong and wise to protect, is the first
explorer on record. He presumably
had no fear of unfriendly gods, desired
to know more of devils and the extent
and nature of their country, had a
curiosity to find out exactly where
Ocean fell over the brink into the
enormous cataract of legend.
But the explorer is no mere victim
of wanderlust, that child of George
Borrow and the American booksellers.
The recording, as well as the appre¬
hension, of the hitherto geographically
unknown, is a necessary qualification
of exploration. There may have been
[14]
FUTURE OF EXPLORATION
Mayans who explored down through
Panama, came to Peru, turned over
across the Andes and discovered Manoa,
urged to it all by the desire for know¬
ledge ; there may have been Norse¬
men who left Red Eric’s land on the
St. Lawrence, voyaged down the
Mexican Gulf in the twelfth century,
and wandered through the Nahua
republics to the Pacific shore ; Bush¬
men of South Africa may once, in
ten generations, have produced some
anomalous son who set out through the
Kalahari and so northwards, by Congo
and the dank forests and the Great
Desert till he stood amazed on the
borders of Roman Numidea. But these
hypothetical adventurers left no records
with which the modern world is
familiar. Probably they left no records
at all.
Even had they done so the lands of
their explorations would still remain,
[15]
HANNO
to us of Aryan speech and Mediter¬
ranean script, unexplored. For China,
at the least, expelled from her borders,
at lengthy intervals, adventurers into
the geographically unknown who had
the divine urge upon them. South-
eastwards and south into the Malay
Archipelago they explored ; they may
even have reached Australia and
America before the Europeans. But
the Chinese mind, platitudinous,
symbol-seeking, moralistic, is ill equip¬
ment for an explorer. The histories
of these explorations are things of
mist and fantasy, voyagings to lands
of faery and fatuity.
No doubt an intelligent pigmy of
the Wambattu, questioned as to the
future of exploration, would reply:
“ Immense. Outside the range of the
Great Forest the world remains un¬
explored.” In these pages I have
attempted some other answer. The
[16]
FUTURE OF EXPLORATION
intelligent Wambattu and the
intelligent Scotsman—Mr. John
Buchan writing in The Last Secrets
that “ there are no more unvisited,
forbidden cities or unapproached high
mountains or unrecorded great
rivers ”—are conservatives both.
To be suggestive rather than
authoritative (as in the following
pages) is a practice without honour in
modern pamphleteering. The present
writer is, however, compelled to admit
that he himself has never explored the
unexplored, even as (he believes)
Professor Einstein has shown a com¬
plete inability to curve round the
cosmos on a straight line, in order to
prove authoritative on Relativity.
Some of the impedimenta of
exploration I have considered may
never be invented. They may never
be required. The inventor-explorer
may pass beyond them in leaps.
[17]

Leonardo applying his mind to
exploring equipment would no doubt
have produced craft weird and com¬
plicated enough—chefs-d'oeuvre in the
imagery of Mr. Heath Robinson.
History plays sad pranks with all
prophecies.
Nor is it the purely fantastic
prophecy of mechanical development
that most frequently earns the ridicule
of the unborn. An inquiring and
imaginative soul of Neolithic times who,
impressed by his first years of dugouts,
prophesied that in the future dugouts
more and more gigantic would be
built, that paddles 40 feet long
would be wielded and trees capable
of building such monstrous craft would
be found, would have erred grievously.
Yet it would have been a legitimate
prophecy for his time. Far more so
than to prophesy that immense hulks,
fashioned of the same material as the
[18]
FUTURE OF EXPLORATION
scarce pieces of dull iron-metal which
he wore as charms, would one day ride
the waves.
To consider the possible development
of the aeroplane into helicopter or
ornithopter, the “ submarine ” into
submersible, the projectile into a
traverser of the immensities of space
may be to reason logically but to
prophesy ludicrously. Chariots of fire
may yet ride the skies. A pin point
of atomic energy may yet be capable
of hurling regular trains of projectile-
carriages safely and conveniently across
the solar system, from planet to planet,
carriages de luxe of the Selenite
Syndicate, and the like. But such
possibilities are outside consideration
To-Day and To-Morrow. Their
triumphant realization lies at least a
week ahead.
To explore an atom may be a greater
achievement than to explore a con-
09]
HANNO
tinent, but actual physical exploration
of the unknown—geographical,
selenographical, aerographical, stello-
graphical—has a deeper and simpler
urge and impulse. Far from having
shrunken, its fields stretch infinite
to the telescopic stars. As yet our
Earth is largely terra incognita, not
only to the Mediterranean peoples,
the whites, but to all mankind. Even
its surface, so largely mapped and
confident, with its radio stations, its
air-routes, its steamship-lines, has
kinks and belts and desert and jungle
waste untrodden by any Caucasian.
There are still mountains to climb,
rivers to cross, ruins to unearth and
scripts to decipher. There are still
shores and islands in the great ocean
rifts unvisited by ship or sail, unstrewn
with trippers’ banana-skins, un¬
awakened by the music of the phono¬
graph.
[20]
FUTURE OF EXPLORATION
In and beneath the tumbling
immensities of the tides, below the
earth’s crust, in peak and swamp and
guarded forest, are dark lands and
kingdoms of wonder awaiting the
explorer of to-morrow.
And in that same to-morrow—not
in the far deeps of the future—the
first terrestrial explorer to achieve
an inter-planetary crossing will gaze
out on the dark mountain-bluffs, the
unearthly jungles and the careering
whirlwinds of an alien world. And
behind him in the years, successors
of Hanno, out beyond station and
trading-post and the known and lit
places of knowledge on that soon
unalien planet, other explorers will
press forward, over the brinks of
reddened oceans, into dark lands of
chanting devils and infernal fires . . .
The bespectacled apostles of valour
and virility who, in Jaeger underwear
[21]
HANNO
and the monthly reviews, bewail the
passing of these virtues with the
prospect of universal disarmament,
are needlessly alarmed. In the
explorer’s safari and the explorer’s
trail there is enough and to spare of
adventure and hardihood to last all
mankind for a length of time stretching
as remote into the future as the Pliocene
does into the past.
But in that tremendous morrow of
the explorer we can hope that a sane
world will send him forth, whether
into the tunnels of the earth, the wells
of the sea or the starred depths of the
ether, with full equipment and blessing
and cheer. No longer will philanthropic
industrialists or bombastic societies of
subscription scientists rule and restrain
the while leaders plead for grants,
no longer will the under-fed, under¬
staffed expedition crawl and rot by
jungle trails because of the indifference
[22]
FUTURE OF EXPLORATION
or jealousy of the world from which it
has gone forth. Science and order will
rule that world, the snarling
buffooneries of competition have given
place to the sanities of universal
co-operation.
Yet still the explorer will pass
unguarded into the unknown, still will
danger lie awaiting him in pits and
kloofs and horrifying shapes. Still will
men die on lonely mountain-tops, in
frozen wastes, far and forgotten.
Across undreamt-of lands they will
pass and vanish, following the
immemorial piping of Romance beyond
the mountains.
[23]
II
Icefield, Forest and Waste
There are freakish folk who main¬
tain our planet to be in shape an
inverted cone, to be a hollow cylinder.
Even the conventional geographer has
passed beyond the belief that the
earth’s shape is spheroid. It is rather
roughly tetrahedral, with a north¬
wards, asymetrical bulge. Mercator’s
projection, so long accused of dis¬
tortion, is, scanned north of the
equator, probable a more accurate
representation of the sub-arctic than
is any globe.
But for illustration the globe is
still useful, in spite of wild rifts and
bulges, intractions and protuberances
unsuspected two centuries ago. From
[24]
FUTURE OF EXPLORATION
Northern to Southern Pole the dark
places on it, unexplored, lying patchily,
in irregular belts, are roughly
classifiable in their characteristics into
Icefield, Waste, Forest, Waste, Icefield.
If a sackful of grain were
miraculously spilled from Heaven in
the midst of a snow-covered meadow
and its advent made known in vision
to a few of the more extremely hungry
and adventurous of the surrounding
fowl-runs, numerous faint trails, con¬
verging towards the grain, would soon
print the snow. The grain found and
gorged by the hardier of the sack-
seekers, the fowls, stomach-proud and
a little dizzy, would retrace their
steps, and the snowfield, with all its
unvisioned mysteries, remain much
as before.
So, to a large extent, it has been
with the ice-caps of Arctica and
Antarctica. Lure of the grainsacks—
[25]
HANNO
the Poles—has drawn the explorer
by many different routes, but the
Lands Between still stretch their
leagues of terra incognita to challenge
the venturous.
Arctica unexplored possesses a giant
triangle, not quite isosceles, with a
line reaching from the Liakhoffs to
Point Barrow for its base and the
North Pole for apex. De Long’s
furthest north in 1881 has been almost
the only incursion of the explorer upon
it. Its white allure is fringed with
moving ice-sheets, east of which the
Fram once scraped in its historic
drift. Its survey and exploration
present problems which I cannot but
believe will be overcome, though
certainly neither by athletes nor special
correspondents. Amongst explorers
the Siberian coast is held to be the
best base of approach and there are
lumours that the Moscow and Lenin-
[26]
FUTURE OF EXPLORATION
grad societies are already fitting out
expeditions for that venture.
In either these or other future
expeditions it is improbable that any
extreme departure from the con¬
ventional in Arctic equipment will
be achieved. The giant northern
triangle has the promise of being a
wilderness of uncertain winds, snows,
and ice-hail—at least to a distance
reaching far pole-wards. Some develop¬
ment of the German rotor-sledge may
be used beyond the water-stretches.
For purposes of northern exploration
the aeroplane has been much over¬
praised. It is no more an instrument of
exploration than Herr Amundsen is
an explorer. The trans-Arctic flights
early in the present decade achieved
nothing ; they were mere exuberances
of ignorance favoured by inexuberance
of climate. As a scouting and general
survey instrument it has its uses under
[27]
HANNO
favourable conditions. The Great
Triangle is seldom likely to provide such.
But neither aeroplane nor airship
is the last word in aircraft. Their
mastery of the air is scarcely beyond the
level attained in the mastery of the
water by the catamaran of the dawn-
savage. The time is probably very
near when the Wright invention,
with its pitiful inability to achieve
vertical ascents or descents, its clumsy
and continuous stalling dangers and
general untrustworthiness, may be
superseded by craft that will indeed
transform normal land exploration;
craft capable of hovering (i.e. of being
maintained in the air with the
propulsion screw shut off) are almost
within the inventor’s view. The
autogiro has pointed the way.
But even this impending transforma¬
tion of the flying machine will scarcely
affect Arctica. Probably to the last
[28]
FUTURE OF EXPLORATION
the explorer upon it will explore as at
the beginning. Mechanical aids will
remain few and far between.
The case alters with the half-
explored Arctic and sub-Arctic belts
lying south of the Great Triangle.
Attempts at exploration of North
Alaska and the North-West of the
Northern Territories have of recent
years been carried out almost entirely
by aeroplane, notably in the American
Government surveys of 1926. From the
very nature of present-day aircraft,
however, such exploration has remained
in the nature of the exploration of the
moon’s surface achieved by telescope.
In this southern fringe of the great
Northern ice-belts, the explorer of
to-morrow, following the finger-posts
of the American 1926 Survey, will
find aircraft useful enough for scouting
purposes. Bases in North Saskatchewan
are most likely to be adopted, and the
[29]
HANNO
attack made northwards with dog-
sledge. Scouting aeroplanes will select
in advance suitable camping-places
and depots.
In these mountain crinkles, where
one range has again and again been
traversed by the casual prospector,
and another, untrodden, has been
glimpsed through mist and fantasy,
exploration and mapping from central
camps over definite areas appears to
be the most obvious task for future
expeditions. Air photography will
help, especially in determining the
exact position of the dim Alaskan
volcanoes said to have been sighted.
There is an Indian-Esquimaux
legendary land in these Northern
wastes—an Amerindian Avalon, a valley
deep in the mountain-blocks, shut-off,
secure, with unfreezing rivers and
mighty trees. Lone miners and trappers
have heard of it; they say that the
[30]
FUTURE OF EXPLORATION
mammoth still browses in its hidden
woods.
In 1926 a remarkable experience in
these latitudes befell Colonel Williams,
one of the aviators of the American
Survey, and his mechanic, Caldwell.
Flying over unfamiliar country in
rough and foggy weather, they had
been watching the mountain serrations
below them, bare, snow-spilt, jagged,
with the dun tundra swamps inter¬
spersing. Suddenly, in the racing
mountain-edges below them, leapt to
view a wide valley, tree-covered, with
the glint of running water. For an
amazing moment they saw it, then the
mist blotted it out.
Amidst its forests rich nasal gentle¬
men may yet pursue the prehistoric
with elephant guns.
In size, however, the ice-lands of
the unexplored South dwarf the
Northern. Almost half the Antarctic
[3i]
HANNO
continent remains untraversed and
unknown. From Kaiser Wilhelm Land
to Coat’s Land it is an uncertainly-
dotted coast-line, except for the
Enderby-Kemp tintings.
Three main reasons have left this
stretch almost entirely unexplored:
It is a land of mist, the pack ice
surrounding it proving almost channel¬
less, except to the fortunate,
encountering freakish drifts ; there is
no convenient base of approach ; its
coast-line bulges far out into the Circle,
thereby almost trebling the distance
between any point of disembarkation
and the Pole, when compared with the
comparatively short route from South
Victoria Land.
Hitherto, because of that unattained
Pole, the opposite quadrants have
attracted the explorer. (Shackleton
in his last voyage is an exception.)
Their coast-lines have been accurately
[32]
FUTURE OF EXPLORATION
charted. Great stretches of their
interior, fringing the different south¬
wards routes, have been made known.
New Zealand and Australia have
supplied convenient bases of approach.
Since the theatrical gorging of the
grain in 1911-12, however, the main
distraction from the serious business of
Antarctic exploration has ceased to
exist. A large-scale expedition to
unexplored Antarctica, with South
Africa or South America for direct
base, fully equipped with ice-breaking
ships and aircraft, is a likely event
within the next few years.
Such expedition will probably
attempt the coast west of Enderby
Land, in ships built on the lines of the
Discovery, and attain it well before
the winter closes in. This will allow
for the selection of suitable anchor¬
age for wintering-in, and also for
the mapping and survey of the
[33]
D
HANNO
coast-lying lands before the light
fails.
It is to be hoped that such expedition
will be one of picked personnel, that
wardroom and messdeck will be one.
Distinctions of class have hitherto
been the curse of exploration in the
icefields. The inane “ discipline ” so
much lauded has been productive of
little more than sloth, indifference, and
responsibility-evasion. The future
explorers of unknown Antarctica should
each be picked men, equals in that all
are specialists, disciplined by know¬
ledge and self-training, not by the
monkey-adornments of uniform and
the clownish posturings of enforced
“ respect
Early in the spring an expedition
on the scale assumed should, with
good leadership and helicopter air¬
craft, achieve more in a few months
than has been achieved in the other
[34]
FUTURE OF EXPLORATION
quadrants of Antarctica since the
days of Ross. Without reliable air¬
craft, capable of combating weather
conditions uncertain in everything but
uncertainty, it is probable that such
an expedition would be largely a waste
of time and money. All deductions
point to the fact of the pole-wards ice-
sheaths beyond the coast being
practically impassable on foot.
Coastal explorations by sledge—
especially south-westwards, towards
Coat’s Land, to ascertain the existence
of the suspected mountain-barriers—
should not prove impracticable. Air¬
craft scouting southwards will be able
to plant advanced bases around which
detailed exploration can be carried
out. These latter will be primarily
geological, the wider geographical
limnings being carried out by airmen.
Shackleton on his furthest south dis¬
covered coal. Perhaps in Antarctica
lie great coalfields and beds of yet richer
[35]
HANNO
ore. An Antarctic gold rush in the
explorer’s trail would probably prove
an excellent substitute for contra¬
ception in solving the world s problems
of over-population.
All three of the more important
Waste Lands of the Northern hemi¬
sphere—the Saharan Imoshagh-
Tawarek regional, the South Arabian
interior and the hill country of Upper
Burma—are still largely terra
incognita. All three are roughly
bisected by the Tropic of Cancer.
Though also untraversed, the other
two are far less lands unknown than
is the mysterious South Arabian
Desert.
Sahara has proved of recent years a
constant lure to the over-rich and the
under-educated amongst the un¬
employed. Resultant on strange desert
stravaigings with undigested caravans,
the European presses yearly disgorge
[36]
FUTURE OF EXPLORATION
stout volumes of unbelievable stodgi¬
ness and inaccuracy. These super¬
tourist excesses have tended to confuse
the genuine explorer and general public.
For the exploration of much that
remains untraversed and unknown,
some understanding with the tribes
of the interior would seem a first
necessity. France, devouring the
Sahara, partook of a dish which has
left her unnaturally and unhealthily
distended ever since. More recently
the conquering and civilizing of the
Riffi has stirred the embers of Jihad
across half a continent. The more
remote the oasis, the more white they
glow. For some time to come it is
probable that any exploration of
account will have to be made by the
educated Moslem of the type of
Hussanein Bey.
With respect to the somewhat readily
stirred Moslem imagination, it must
[37]
HANNO
be admitted that such explorations are
likely to remain unproductive of
accurate mapping and recording. To¬
morrow, when Europeanization is no
longer synonymous with machine-
gunning and concession-grabbing, the
explorer will find a field of venture
well worth the outlay of patience and
diplomacy which its exploration is
likely to exact. From Kawar as a
base, or even from the mid-Egyptian
frontier, the westwards-lying desert
will probably be best crossed by the
light motor-car. The caterpillar system
replacing the wheels has not proved
an unmixed blessing, and it offers
interesting experiments in design to
produce the light and swift traverser
of the sands. But much of the land,
the soft and shifting dunes, the great
rock stretches, will have to await the
close and accurate exploration of a
helicopter expedition.
[38]
FUTURE OF EXPLORATION
The main discoveries in Sahara will
no doubt be ethnological. The
rumoured oases of antiquity lie in the
south-west of the land, as do the
mountains of Berber legend. Archaeo¬
logical remains in the Sahara have
been too often hoped for and too seldom
found; credulity still strews the
unknown sands with Egyptian remains.
But it is extremely improbable that
the Egyptians of pre-Christian years
ever penetrated far into the Red
Desert, let alone the Tawarek regional.
The early Egyptians were an owlish
people, interested enough in cheap
slaves and stolen mines, but even more
interested in abiding by Nile-bank and
uprearing monstrous sepulchres for
their dead and the bored wonder of
posterity.
The Northern Burmese hill-jungles
are properly outside the description of
Waste Land. The surrounding wastes
[39l
HANNO
impose the nomenclature. Lying
roughly between the 22nd and the
26th parallels of latitude, the country
of the Northern Chins, including the
Chin Hills proper, remained unknown,
a land of fable and unreliable place-
names, until a few years ago. Political
troubles then led to the despatch of
a British mission into the far northern
country of the Nagas (Luhupas).
The mission, politely received and
carefully shepherded along trodden
paths, called together gatherings of
chiefs and expounded to them the
morality of the Chemical Age as an
improvement upon that of the Sun
Stone—a proceeding which goes to
prove that neither simple faith nor
audacity is wanting in the modern
explorer.
These northern tribesmen would
appear a more or less settled agricul¬
tural people, undisturbed through the
[40]
FUTURE OF EXPLORATION
centuries by the changes of time and
fate and faith ; a simple, Heliolithic
folk, still sacrificing to the Spring and
the cattle-gods, and probably, in the
interests of economy, cheating the
latter by the occasional disembowel-
ment of an unhappy captive rather
than the belle of a tribe. Their land,
rolling in volcanic corrugations to the
equally uncertain and untraversed
Chinese frontier, will no doubt soon
be explored by the English, most
careful and indefatigable of explorers.
Aeroplanes or autogiros may first
be used for general survey and
mappings ; a large and well-founded
expedition, starting from some base
well up a confluence of the Chindwin,
out-fitted with maps obtained from the
aeronautical surveys, and relying more
on these than on local guides, should
obtain good results. Certainly, apart
from geographical considerations, the
[4i]
HANNO
region offers an ethnographic field of
study to be found nowhere else, since,
with the extinction of the Central
American and Ouichan “ civilizations ”,
the Heliolithic phase of culture has
elsewhere passed from the face of the
earth. Of geographical discoveries,
sister-sources of several of the Chinese
rivers are probable. The flora of the
country is said to possess aberrations
from normal stocks.
Last and most mysterious, the third
waste land of the Northern hemi¬
sphere, is the desert of Northern
Arabia, north of the Hadramaut,
between Yemen and Oman. It is
the most guarded of all the un¬
penetrated lands, both by the natural
phenomena of thirst and sandstorm
and by the tribes surrounding. Data
concerning it is scant and confusing ;
neither native nor European seems to
have done more than traverse its
[42]
FUTURE OF EXPLORATION
fringes. It is probably a limestone
country. In remote ages it is said to
have been tracked by merchant
routes—not one or two main routes,
but many. If that was the case, it
can be assumed that these caravan-
routes were not mere trading-roads
into nothingness, or that their
multitude only provided com¬
munication between Yemen, Oman,
and the desert outpost of Riadh. At
some time there were probably central
oases, worth trading with and capable
of recuperating and refreshing the
caravans travelling from either coast.
The Wahabis, and the wave of
insanitary Moslem bigotry that has
followed their conquest of Hussein’s
kingdom, have probably put checkmate
to the exploration of the Arabian
desert for many years to come, unless
a plentiful supply of bakshish is used
to salve the outraged Moslem soul.
[43]
HANNO
With present political entanglements,
however, an expedition without official
backing would merely offer itself a
sacrifice to an older desert god than
He of the Caaba.
More likely in the near future is an
attempted exploration by some single
individual of European education, with
camel-caravan and all the well-worn
paraphernalia of desert-venture. Such
explorer will as certainly carry his
life in his hands as he will launch out
into the conquest of one of the most
fascinating tracts of the earth unknown
to European science.
The Southern belts of Waste Land
also fringe upon a tropic line. The
Kalahari Desert and North Bechuana-
land are almost bisected by Capricorn ;
the unexplored bush tracts of Northern
and Western Australia lie just north of
it. In direct line it passes through much
of the unknown of south-central South
[44]
FUTURE OF EXPLORATION
America, but there the lands, in spite
of pampas encroachments, are largely
virgin jungle, and outside the
description of “ waste
That much remains to be made
known of Northern Bechuana, and
especially of the lands about Lake
Ngami, was proved only a year
or so ago by the expedition under
Dr. Schwartz which returned reporting
one of the strangest mass-changes of
vegetation ever observed over a wide
district within the space of a few years.
Great tracts south of Ngami still await
opening by the strongly equipped
safari. Preliminary aeronautical
surveys would be of quite inestimable
value. Unless the helicopter comes
early, the unveiling of central Kalahari,
that ochre blank upon the maps, is
likely to be long delayed.
Australia offers a different problem.
Its deserts have been traversed and
[45]
HANNO
roughly mapped in much the same way
as the icefields of Antarctica. As the
icefield explorer has hitherto sought
to reach the Pole, so the desert-
adventurers of Australia have mostly
sought to make a crossing from desert-
frontier to desert-frontier. An amazing
apathy in obtaining knowledge of its
own island-continent has been shown
by the Australian Government.
“ Practical ” considerations—doubts as
to the “ value ” of such explorations—
are the main determents. Neither
unexploited native nor unopened gold¬
field is believed to yearn for discovery
within the dark oval fastness shored
by the Ashburton Range, Central
Mt. Stuart, Mt. Russell, and the
Northern Mt. Wittenoon. Even
aeronautical survey has been left to
the southern stars in their nightly
circlings. Nevertheless, the coming of
the government geographer is little
[46]
FUTURE OF EXPLORATION
likely to be delayed, for Australia is
a progressive state, with slums, strike¬
breakers, and imperial aspirations, and
cannot long tolerate a tract of the
primeval at its back door.
Of the great Forest Belts—our
planet’s dark Equatorial girdle—the
sylvancB incognita of the Amazon
Valley stretch in leagues unsuspected
from a casual glance at the Brazilian
map. The exploring of the greater
tributaries has not by any means
meant the exploring of the sur¬
rounding country. Few can conceive
the stretches of jungle lying between
the waterways. In the Acre Territory,
between the Rios Acre, Purus, and
Yaraucca is an extent of virgin country
of at least four hundred square miles ;
between the Tapajos and the Rio
Xinqu in Para there is a tract of almost
equal extent ; in the State of Matto
Grosso, between the Madeira Marmore
[47]
HANNO
Railway and the north of El Gran
Chaco—an extent of some eight
hundred miles—is darkest America,
inhabited by ghostly tribes which are
perhaps the residue of the original
prehistoric drift of the genus homo.
The problem of exploring these
lands is a heavy one. The climate is,
from the point of view of modern
man, the most inhospitable in the
world. It is a stretch of the world which
has missed several geological ages,
its flora drips with the mists and slimes
of an early Carboniferous period ; its
insect life—queer, strange, almost, one
would guess, conscious in its defiance
of man—is constant torment and
danger ; its human inhabitants, cut
off for a quarter of a million years from
the outside world, are probably even
more alien and mentally incompre¬
hensible than the half-known tribes
of the river-banks. Natural man, as
[48]
FUTURE OF EXPLORATION
dreamt of by Rousseau and the
Encyclopaedists, uncorrupted by
civilization and its vices, feasts
cannibalistically on his latest-born
progeny (the mother is suspended by
the wrists from a tree during child¬
birth) in his last stronghold beyond the
furthest tributaries of the Tapajos.
In the Upper Amazon the Hamilton
Rice Expedition of 1925-6 carried
out aeronautical surveys of great tracts
of forest. The very success of these
surveys emphasized the uselessness and
unreliability of the aeroplane in actual
exploration ; to survey is not to
explore. Until the helicopter comes
both the Acre Territory and the
Pampas Sacramento are likely to
remain untrodden by the European.
The case alters with the unexplored
of the States of Para and Matto Grosso.
The Brazilian scheme of planting
“Native Attraction Outposts”
[49]
E
HANNO
gradually deeper and deeper into the
jungle, is winning the success that such
enlightened policy deserves. The
exploration of both “ darkest America
and the forests bordering the Rio
Xinqu will undoubtedly be best carried
out by Government expeditions and
missions. Small river-ships, with deck-
spaces for amphibian aircraft, and
operating southwards from Santarem,
are likely to be used ; it is to be hoped
that greater care will be taken in the
selection of personnel for such
expeditions than has hitherto been
displayed by the private exploring
party—all too frequently staffed by
either sentimental enthusiasts or a
type of scientific hooligan.
The half-explored forests of Congo
suffer these days from a woise pest
than the tsetse or the mosquito.
It is a land which shares the sufferings
of Sahara. It is tracked and counter-
[50]
FUTURE OF EXPLORATION
tracked by the lady explorer—mostly
either English or American. She comes
upriver from Loango to Leopoldville,
then plunges into the wilds with a y
large safari of porters and an even
larger guard of askaris. Like the
devouring locust or the marching ant,
nothing in her track escapes her. She,
one suspects, exasperates Belgian
officials and native headmen to
murderous longings for the revival
of cannibalism and the head-pot.
Her exploits would be merely
laughable were it not for the fact that
she “ explores ” over tracts traversed
again and again, thereby puzzling
polite geographical societies by the
discovery ” of rivers and swamps
which have been included in official
maps during the last fifty years. She
is under the dominion of her porters
and her guard, however little she may
suspect it. No safari with such leader-
[5i]
HANNO
ship penetrates willingly into the
tracts—numerous enough—inhabited
by tribes which have no need to long
for the return of cannibalism. For
much of equatorial Africa of the
forests, traversed as it has been, still
retains its secrets, still calls for the
educated explorer, with experience,
tact, and a small and reliable safari.
Further north, French territory back
of the Ogowe River still shoals from its
dwindling and unmapped forests
occasional tribes to surprise stray
officials and besiege missionary out¬
posts for the curing of ulcers and the
interpretation of strange tongues.
Last on the list, curious and apart,
the wooded fastnesses of Central Borneo
and New Guinea present their problems
and allure. In a survey as brief as this
of the world’s unexplored land-surface,
they must abide by even slighter
description than their fellows. Of the
[52]
FUTURE OF EXPLORATION
two, the magnetic allure of Inland
New Guinea is surely unparalleled.
As in the Upper Burman Waste the
last of the Sunstone Folk still hold
their own and live the ancient life that
once belted the world from France to
Mayapan, so in the hill-forests of New
Guinea, sly, treacherous, swamp and
poison defended, stoutly conservative
and impervious to the penetration of
Red Plots, the last of a yet more
ancient dawn-culture than the
Heliolithic still flourishes and smokes
the heads of captives, as across in the
kindred Solomons.
Both it and Central Borneo—of which
recent and unsuccessful attempts at
penetration are reported—await the
scientist-explorer. In both an armed
helicopter expedition would achieve
more in a few weeks than all the
previous expeditions of the last three
centuries.
[53]
Ill
Submarine
The great blind science of oceanography
has advanced far since the days of the
Challenger and her romantic voyagings
and gropings in the latter half of the
nineteenth century. Nowadays there
is hardly a great ocean area but has
been mapped, charted, dredged
and sounded, unless it be the Antarctic
Ocean within the limits of the Drift
Ice Line. Yet scarcely one of all the
leagues of sea-bottom has been seen
or trodden by men.
This is a fact disconcerting enough
when one reflects that the oceans cover,
an area two and a half times as
extensive as the land surface and we
are vet bidden to view a world robbed
[54]
FUTURE OF EXPLORATION
of its “ last secrets Oceanographic
achievements with dredger, cable, and
sounding line have hitherto been mere
tentative gropings in the dark. Perhaps
these tentacular Teachings have merely
dragged and scraped along the canyons
or across the unfertile hogbacks of
the submarine world; perhaps a
strange, alien plant life, hardly
dependent on actinic stimulus,
luxuriates in the remotest depths;
perhaps the narwhal and the sea-
serpent and the giant polyp do verily
inhabit the unplumbed depths, awaiting
the time when a strange new metallic
monster will invade their solitudes.
It must be admitted that these
faithful reportorial stand-bys of the
dull season are likely to await for many
a long year the coming of their con¬
queror—if he ever comes. There is no
such urge towards the invention of
the deep-sea submersible as there is
[55]
HANNO
towards the perfecting of the flying-
machine. For, though the blind science
may have groped and charted with chill
fingers and uncertain purpose, it has
brought from out of the depths but
little to stimulate enthusiasm or
awaken wonder. Deep sea plants and
beasts are flora and fauna of faith, not
fact. Perhaps the stretching im¬
mensities of the Atlantic and Pacific
Abyssal Plains will for ever remain
unexplored. Radiolarian muds and
clays and oozes, the minute siltings
and deposits of minute life through
uncountable millenia, would appear
to floor the greater area of these sunken
lands three thousand fathoms below
the sea-surface, in murky twilights
where the sun’s rays hardly penetrate.
And in their leagues of flatness these
plains have little in contour to relieve
their monotony. They appear to lack,
lifeless and cold and far more dead
[56]
FUTURE OF EXPLORATION
than any planet of outer space, either a
past or a present of organic life; their ex¬
ploration lacks the incentive of wonder.
For in the mental equipment of the
explorer who accomplishes—he who
invents and plans and voyages with
unquenchable ardour—there is a more
primitive and complex quality than
scientific enthusiasm. The Unknown
for him must be the Knowable—
glamoured by wonder. He is no
passionless scientist, content to dredge
minute algae and the like—and still
feel upon him the urge to dredge and
bottle and label kindred algae. He
demands drama and wonder on heroic
scale.
Further, by what means the “ sub¬
marine ” ship of to-day may develop
into the submersible cruiser of the
future we cannot even guess. The
problem seems as insuperable as the
enlargement of the powers of the
[571
HANNO
telescope. Both instruments may be
constructed in gigantic sizes, but the
gain in proportion to the increase of
area is, beyond a certain point,
practically nil. Each instrument, as
instrument, has a definite limit of
development. No telescope will ever
draw very much nearer to our gaze
the outer heavens than does—say—
the Mt. Wilson instrument; no “ sub¬
marine ” will prove capable of much
deeper immersion than the later type
U-boat or the more modern Lake
products.
Nevertheless, we may assume that,
just as some new form of star-gazer—
some combination of gigantic artificial
crystals, perhaps—will yet supersede
the telescope and transform astronomy,
so the so-called submarine will
ultimately be rendered obsolete by
the invention of some under-sea craft
capable of resisting successfully the
[58]
FUTURE OF EXPLORATION
enormous pressures at the sea-bottom.
This craft will be fitted with some form
of motive power other than those at
present known. It will be capable of
sinking and rising with ease and
certainty, of crawling the sea-bottoms,
of cruising the strange worlds of the
mid-waters, of threading the rifts and
gorges of the Great Deeps.
So much we may assume, for the
wonder-urge which drives the
mechanical inventor to achievement is
of a different order to that which
inspires the explorer. So equipped,
men will turn their attention to the
exploration of the ocean-floors. Even
from the viewpoint of present know¬
ledge, not all of these lack wonder-<
allure. The geologist-explorer may yet
be able to ascertain, by descending the
shelving canyons of the great Nero
Deep off the Ladrones, what truth lies
in the belief that the moon was shorn
[59]
HANNO
from the earth’s side long after the
cooling process was under way; he
may yet descend and explore the
strange belt of under-water volcanoes
which culminate in Krakatoa.
More than any other is the Atlantic
a sea of legend. Tradition and folk¬
lore tell of it islanded and peopled.
Somewhere upon it the Greeks placed
their Islands of the Blest. The Keltic
Avalon lay westwards. Plato tells of
Atlantis. On the other side of the ocean
the Nahua peoples had legends of an
eastwards land sunk beneath the waters.
Quetzalcoatl was of that land, and
returned to it after his civilizing works
amongst the pre-Toltec and Mayan
tribes. It is true he made his next
avatar from Europe in the person of
a mean-minded, meanly-bearded
clown in scale-armour, whom the
Amerindians found little cause
to worship. Probably the trans-
[60]
FUTURE OF EXPLORATION
planted Quetzalcoatl stock had de¬
generated.
Legend and tradition apart, there
are ethnological reasons—since the
abandonment of the absurd belief
that the Central American Indians were
of Mongolian descent—for postulating
the existence of the sunken land.
There appear strange affinities in type,
in art, in religious outlook, between
the Neolithic cave-dwellers of Spain
and Southern France and the Nahuas
of Mexico and Yucatan. Perhaps the
Basques are descended from the
survivors of the western inundation of
Atlantis.
Exploration by the submersibles of
the future will decide the question once
and for all. Equipped with giant
searchlights, expeditions from Europe
and America will descend to chart and
map the Northern and Central Atlantic.
It is improbable that either sunken
[61]
HANNO
cities or petrified forests will be found.
Atlantis, if it ever existed, probably
never attained to a culture as advanced
as the Sunstone ; its forests will have
long since withered into ooze.
Assuredly no cable line lies across the
roofs of a ruined Acropolis.
With the coming of the submersible
and the shrinkage of the unknown
land-surface, many an explorer of the
future will doubtlessly be attracted
to submarine research along the North
African, Arabian, and Indian coasts.
There, at the least, there are buried
cities and whelmed sea-borders awaiting
exploration and excavation. Perhaps
such venture may be an exploring
commonplace within the next few
years, even whilst the submersible still
remains a scientific dream. Good
charting, dredging, and diving
equipment the explorer will require.
All three are at present rare enough.
[62]
FUTURE OF EXPLORATION
The ancient, clumsy, and complicated
diving suits provided with air tubes
to the surface, still used by even
Government services, are ill adapted
to the purposes of submarine
exploration. Even the suits equipped
with knapsack oxygen generators are
generally miracles of shoddy untrust¬
worthiness. Yet to provide a satis¬
factory diving-suit, one capable of
resisting enormous pressures, should
prove a simple achievement for the
modern inventor.
Yet even To-Morrow, when the
seas give up their secrets to the
explorer equipped with submersible
and scientific diving-gear, it is
improbable that the unknown lands of
under-ocean will call with half the
allure of unclimbed mountain or un¬
traversed swamp. Even with the last
of these climbed and traversed, he will
not for long turn to the sea. He will
[63]
HANNO
pass on, in his ceaseless questing,
to lands of demon and demiurge
—“ for there are greater wonders
there.”
[64]
IV
Subterranean
Mr. Wells’s Grand Lunar displayed a
justifiable astonishment on learning
that men know nothing of the interior
of their planet. Below our feet is a
world unexplored. Men have
penetrated only a few miles within the
earth’s crust, and in that penetration
have followed the quest of certain very
localized minerals. In the wake of the
miner the geologist has tapped and
queried and theorized, but the earth’s
interior is still as darkly unknown to
modern science as the outside world
is to the pigmy of the Wambattu.
Of all regions, the multitude of
theorists on its nature definitely stamps
it The Unknown. The scientist
theorizing on the nature of the earth-
[65]
HANNO
substance six miles below the surface
has to-day as free a hand as the
geographer of the seventeenth century
who postulated vast continents as
theoretical necessities all over the
southern half of the globe. He may
declare for a fluid interior, a metallic
interior, an interior with the
temperature of absolute zero, an
interior with the normal temperature
of 212 degrees F. All these beliefs
have been held, all have been ably,
even venomously, defended. A high
internal temperature was once a
theological necessity and the mounting
mercury of theory received the full
sanction of the Christian Churches.
Indeed, it is probable that for long
the scientist defending the theory of
an entirely molten interior was
influenced—consciously or uncon¬
sciously—by the orthodox Christian
cosmogony. The interior of the earth
[66]
FUTURE OF EXPLORATION
was inconceivable except as an
exceedingly warm region; to think
otherwise would not only have seemed
unscientific, but also grossly Pagan.
Yet it is probable that the Pagan
view of the interior world of Hades as
a dank, dim land is nearer the actual
facts of the case.
Nowadays the Molten Fluidists are
in a minority. A new school of
thought—the definitely Weighty
School—sways the world of the
geologist, however little pressure it
may exert below the crust. The earth
is now assumed to have an outer crust,
thirty or forty miles in depth, of rock-
substance (mineral) ; below that is a
solid metallic core, subjected to
enormous pressure, a relic of the
original meteoric commingling from
which this planet enswirled into being.
This theory of the earth’s interior
appears to me even more farcical
[67]
HANNO
than that of the Molten Fluidists. It
is even more archaic in its concept;
it is pre-Copernician. It restores to
the earth its ancient dignity as the
centre of the universe. Both schools
appear to conceive of gravitation as a
mysterious force, alien and apart, in
the earth’s bowels—a force drawing
down upon itself in ever-increasing
pressures, all material substance
attractable. But gravitation pre¬
supposes repulsion as well as attraction.
The earth-mass, it is reasonable to
assume, is held together, not crushed
together, by gravitation. The masses
hold by attraction in a homogeneous
framework; there is as definite
an outward as downward pull; below
a certain depth pressure must definitely
decrease.
Probably this framework, held in
vibrant equilibrium, has a great thick¬
ness, but the interior itself can be
[68]
FUTURE OF EXPLORATION
nothing but a vast hollow, a cavern
of nothingness, with the temperature
of outer space.
Some such view has been advanced,
and defended with much ingenuity,
by Mr. W. H. Herdsman. He, however,
favours a metallic shell for the interior
hollow. This seems to me unwarranted.
It is improbable that the mineral
substance at a great depth differs in
any great degree from that obtaining
six miles below the surface.
To accept this new view entirely
alters any preconceived idea as to the
earth’s “ crust ” being unexplorable.
Accepting it, one concludes that in the
downwards penetration there will be
no enormous pressures to withstand,
no mounting temperatures—except
in very localized areas—to render
passage impossible. Ascertained facts
appear to bear out this view. The
deepest mine in the world—that of
[69]
HANNO
Mono Velha in Brazil—shows, even
in its furthest Teachings, six thousand
feet below the surface, no signs of
unworkableness through increased
pressure. The conventional geologist
would have had its galleries destroyed
by implosion long ago.
The causes of volcanic action and
earthquake shock may be regarded as
almost entirely unconnected. Volcanoes
are the safety valves of detached pools
of molten metal kept in constant
liquidity by a variety of causes—of
which pressure is probably the least.
Earthquakes are probably chiefly due
to crustal faults resulting on the
vibrational “ drum ” of gravitation.
The larger mass of the earth-crust
surrounding the Giant Cavern may
reasonably be regarded as neither solid
nor fluid. It is doubtlessly tunnelled
and corridor-traversed in many
sections. Great areas of it, surrounded
[70]
FUTURE OF EXPLORATION
by “ non-conducting ” walls, are no
doubt reservoirs of heat and power.
Below the great surface oceans it is
believed that other oceans lie, con¬
stantly fed by seepings from above,
constantly ejecting their surplus waters
through wide volcanic belts. Probably
the most extensive of these under¬
ground seas lies in a great oval
stretching from underneath the mid-
Atlantic across to mid-Pacific in the
north, and under-flowing Antarctica
in the South. It is probably exceedingly
shallow, in places a gigantic mud-
swamp, eternally darkened, gaseous,
and unquiet. Its average depths below
the surface may be anything between
ten and fifteen miles. Even above
its shallow waters its roof probably
hangs low, pillared, columned, upheld
by enormous walls.
It is true that the underground
waterways and heatways of the so-
[7i]
HANNO
called crust are as yet guesswork—
though reasonable guesswork. It has
been supposed that another great
subterranean lake, the reservoir of
many sand-lost waters and seeping
river-beds, stretches in twisting channels
far under the eastern Mediterranean
and Asia Minor. Though underground,
it is certain that these shallow seas
are swayed by tides, even as the waters
looked upon by the skies. Probably
they speak of their existence not only
through the volcanoes, but in that
constant, and almost everywhere
uneven, rise and subsidence of the
earth-surface.
Organic life may exist underground
in these great damp caverns and water-
stretches. If so, it will certainly be
aberrant life, in forms perhaps gigantic
and bloated—rock surfaces mantled
with luminous fungi and mosses, seas
swum by blind denizens, descendants
[72]
FUTURE OF EXPLORATION
of piscine strays from the upper
oceans.
At the present rate of depths-
descent in Brazilian mines, the great
sub-American sea may be reached
within the next few years. Wherever
or however the first serious incursion
into the subterranean is made, whether
it fall through accident or design, a
dim and amazing world will lie open
awaiting the scientist-explorer. Craft
will be conveyed down through the
earth-crust and sailed upon the
uncharted waters. Motor-boats with
giant searchlights will sweep their
wide spaces and seek their coasts.
Though it may be assumed that the
air above these waters will in most
regions be breathable, it is probable
that low gas-clouds drift in wide
spaces far from the volcanic belts.
Nor may these voyagings be constantly
in searchlight - stabbed darkness.
[73]
HANNO
Probably over great areas the volcanic
gas flares incandescent above the
waters.
Betwixt the surface and the great
Central Cavern, the earth “ crust ”
is doubtlessly vastly porous, rent
with abysses plunging league-deep.
Both above and below the maximum-
pressure level these great rifts probably
lie. (Below that level the pressure must
become less and less until finally, under
the void of the Great Cavern, the
gravitational pull is probably even less
than upon the surface of our planet.)
There is no reason to suppose that
the subterranean explorer of the
future—however remote—will rest
content with the charting of the seas
and mud swamps of the shallow crustal
caves. Year after year he will penetrate
deeper, through giant corridors, lowered
over immense precipices, descending
past the level where his descent
[74]
FUTURE OF EXPLORATION
becomes ascent. Undreamt-of aircraft
may yet hum in the bowels of the earth,
road-clearers and tunnelling apparatus
beat in an alien air.
What will men find in their pene¬
tration of the subterranean ? Mineral
composite scarce and barely procurable
at the surface, radium pits, new sources
of power and energy, may lie awaiting
discovery in immense deposits.
Galleries and temples of strange beauty
and wonder will astound the
adventurer, strange perfumes and
strange plants discover themselves to
the explorer from the upper world.
Under our feet there is a world to
win.
And that some intrepid Hanno of
the far future will yet penetrate to
the Great Cavern itself there can be
no doubt. What will he find ? A
dense murkiness, airless, an abysmal
cold, or a new world, virgin, metallic-
[75]
HANNO
shored, bathed in a wan electric
twilight ?
It may be that the future home of
mankind, when the last great Ice
Age oversweeps the world, when the
dying sun contracts and its light and
heat diminish, lies within the womb
of our planet. On the shores of the
Great Cavern itself may yet be upbuilt
the future cities of men.
V
Extraterrestrial
The scientific specialist is only too
conscious, in his own department of
interest and investigation, of the con¬
stant changes and fluctuations, the
strange drifting mists of the in¬
explicable, the noise, the turmoil,
and the shouting. Rest there is
nowhere. Yet, because men have
scarcely attempted the upbuilding of
a workable Philosophy of Change, a v
stable background to life is sought after
as a desperate necessity. So the
revolutionary chemist is politically
a conservative, the relativist in
mathematics a dogmatist in religion,
the astronomer profoundly convinced—
from long and detailed investigation—
[77]
HANNO
of the inhabitability of one planet is
as unshakably certain—from hearsay—
of the uninhabitability of another.
At least half the a priori beliefs of
the sciences are built on exploded
falsehoods. The task of seeking out
new foundations, tracing new lines of
correlation and sequence, appals the
investigator willing enough to forge
ahead into the unknown. To return
again and again to re-establish your
base and lines of communication are
disheartening tasks for any expedition.
But in astronomy, more than in any
science, is this required. Half the
theories regarding the growth and
ageing of the planetary bodies have
been deduced from the supposed
“ deadness ” of the moon. That it
should be anything else but a dead
body circling through the void of space
irritates and exasperates the
astronomer anxious to apply con-
[78]
FUTURE OF EXPLORATION
elusions from his long-held belief. The
moon’s demise has so long been cele¬
brated that to any signs of stirring
upon the supposed corpse eyes are
either shut or else tortuous and in¬
genious theories of illusion are
advanced.
The researches of Professor W. H.
Pickering, the greatest modern
authority upon the moon, have quite
definitely established that volcanic
action prevails on large portions of the
moon-surface, that snow-lines ridge
many a hill and valley, that, under a
thin and tenuous atmosphere, and in
the deeper craters and canyons, a
lunar vegetation almost certainly creeps
to being with the sunrise, passes
through three seasons, in the space of
fourteen terrestrial days, and wilts
again into the winter of the moon's
night. Our satellite has as little claim
to be regarded by modern science as a
[793
HANNO
dead world as it had to be regarded,
by the Medieval Church, as a spotless
one.
Whether or not we view the fact with
the ironic horror of an Anatole France,
the " disease ” of organic life is un¬
doubtedly not confined to this planet.
Mars and Venus both possess envelopes
of atmosphere. Principally as a result
of the Mount Wilson observations, it is
now generally conceded that there is
both water and vegetation on Mars.
This concession wrung, with a sulky
reluctance, from his contemporaries,
Professor Lowell went on to propound
the even more heretical belief in the
existence of artificial canals. But at
these, in the absence of the Martian
blue-prints and engineering formulae
which preceded their excavation, the
astronomical world still balks.
Amusingly, the Martians disturb
the sleep and the stable background
[80]
FUTURE OF EXPLORATION
of Professor Pickering ; he disbelieves
in them and their canals because he has
discovered “ canals ” on the moon.
Similarly Professor Lowell derives much
satisfaction from the belief that the
moon is comfortably dead.
Indeed, writing in Mars as the Abode
of Life, Professor Lowell displays even
more naively the characteristics of
the revolutionist-conservative. Of the
Martians of the canal-building he says
“ but body is the last thing we are
likely to know of them ”.
It will probably be the first.
Neither Mars nor the moon,
possessing, as each does, an atmos¬
phere, need nowadays be considered
unexplorable, once the ether is spanned
and their shores attained. Inter¬
planetary communication, however, is
still merely a subject for discussion.
Those against breaking our isolation
in space are so for a number of reasons,
HANNO
the most cogent of which appears to
be that they consider it impossible.
The Planetary Progressives have
generally put forward a case as poor,
certainly as timid. By communication
is meant only signalled communication.
We will demonstrate on great desert
areas, by means of lighted triangles
and the like, our knowledge of Euclid,
and await corresponding geometrical
successes to sprout forth upon the
other planets. The fact of the Martians
or Venusians having probably to a
man long ago out-Einsteined Einstein,
and, in a passion of pity for our
ignorance, attempting to demonstrate
their mathematical conclusions in
lighted inter-whorls which every con¬
ventional terrestrial astronomer would
swear were natural phenomena, is
taken insufficiently into account.
The possibility of actual physical
communication is generally timidly
[82]
FUTURE OF EXPLORATION
banished into the remote future, to
vehicles propelled by induced radio¬
activity. Here and there some wild
soul, experimenting in a back garden
with rockets and the like, will now and
again proclaim to an intrigued and
hilarious Press belief in the power of
his invention to bombard the nearest
heavenly body with projectiles con¬
taining proofs of our cultural progress.
... One is left with vision of a staggered
Lunarian surveying a week-old copy
of Tit-Bits, whilst at his feet, amongst
other disgorgements, lies a specimen
contraceptive apparatus.
Though it is improbable that the
lone experimentalist will ever succeed
in inventing a machine capable of
discharging a projectile-carriage at
sufficient speed to pass beyond the
earth’s gravitational pull, it may be
presumed with certainty that the
first traversement of space will not be
[83]
HANNO
left to either our remote descendants
or Mr. Haldane’s synthetic supplanters.
Given ten years, a well-equipped
laboratory and a competent staff of
assistants, there is hardly an expert
artillery officer, well-grounded in
chemistry, but could succeed in
achieving inter-planetary com¬
munication with experimental pro¬
jectiles. Practical advances in the
science of ballistics have, since the
European War, been all too frequently
concealed behind patriotic smoke¬
screens.
Within the next half century there
is no reason why the moon, at least,
should not be reached, even though
the main explosive force behind the
projectile may be Signor Mussolini in
pursuit of an Italian Empire.
There is a great rock-tundra upon
the moon, the Oceanus Procellarum.
On its western fringes, in lat. 10 degrees
[84]
FUTURE OF EXPLORATION
S., long. 20 degrees E., lies the great
crater of Copernicus, of all Lunar
landmarks the most interesting to the
selenographer. Before the first actual
exploration is attempted by men, it is
probable that by the firing of
experimental projectiles sufficient data
will have been gathered to allow of
positioning landings in advance. The
eastern Oceanus Procellarum is likely
to be selected as the landing-ground
of the first terrestrial expedition.
Several projectiles, fired at intervals,
will probably be used in conveying the
personnel of the expedition. The first
space-carriage will be planned to reach
the moon some time after the lunar
mid-day ; of its five or six occupants
it is to be hoped that Reuter’s corre¬
spondent will need no urging in being
the first to emerge and test the density
of the atmosphere.
Emerging from the projectile, this
[85]
HANNO
advance party of explorers will probably
attempt to make Copernicus, climb its
high buttresses, or pass through the long
ravine-cracks which probably splinter
its walls, and at last determine the
nature of the colour-change that tinges
its floors in varying shades. Even
allowing for the slightness of the air
and the fatigue of marching upon rock-
surface never touched by moisture, the
party, equipped with high pressure
oxygen apparatus, and aided by the
low lunar gravitational pull, will
probably long before the sunset have
entered and explored Copernicus, and
have established the nearest and easiest
route between the crater-bottom and
the projectile. Then, allowing a safe
margin of twenty-four hours or so,
they will re-enter the projectile and
await the coming of a night with a
temperature as low as that of outer
space.
[86]
FUTURE OF EXPLORATION
Somewhere within the sunset the
descent of the second projectile, like
a livid falling star, will be seen by the
first explorers ten or twenty miles
across the Procellarum. In the depths
of the lunar night, invisible in the airless
frozenness, the third projectile will
probably fall. At dawn, in the
unthawing of the hoar-air, rocket-
signals will summon the three exploring
parties together across the rock-
tundra. The united expedition will
then decide upon a base of exploration.
Probably this will largely depend upon
the results gained from the previous
day’s exploration of Copernicus, or
from the site of the largest space-
carriage, which will contain the main
components of the apparatus to be
erected for re-establishing projectile-
communication with the earth.
Leaving a base party to erect
apparatus and establish camp, a main
[87]
HANNO
body will march out on a previously
determined route of exploration.
Besides respirators, it will carry a
supply of highly concentrated foods ;
probably chemicals capable of being
dissolved actinically into drinking
water and other liquids. It will also
bear a supply of powerful explosive,
solutions for raw-burning, and probably
several heavy elephant guns. It will
be prepared for an absence of at least
four months—four lunar days and
nights.
From Copernicus, marching N.N.E.,
this party will reach in lat. 14 degrees
N., the great “ crater ” of Eratosthenes,
a wide, deep-sunken valley ringed by
towering walls. Branching north¬
eastwards from its centre are
the mysterious “ canals ” of
Professor Pickering, and for the first
terrestrial explorers it will be to pass
along the bed or banks of these, and,
in Eratosthenes, look down upon a
[88]
FUTURE OF EXPLORATION
valley either lush in vegetation, watered
and alive, or upon a saline waste
streaked in belts of carbonic acid gas.
With the giant bulking of Eratos¬
thenes, mysterious no longer, behind
them, the party will probably set to
threading the dead rock-stretches east¬
wards and gain a fringe of the
Carpathian Mountains. Somewhere,
on an eastern shoulder of these lunar
high lands, they will—if the night
overtakes them early—blast out a
sleeping-place for the long hours of
darkness and cold. It will be lit and
warmed with crude-burning chemicals.
Probably, across the miles of waste¬
land, the base party beyond Copernicus
will see the red flare-signal of the
easterning explorers from some far
Carpathian ridge.
Or it may be that before sunset, the
party will reach the mountains south
of Herodotus, in Schroter’s valley,
[89]
HANNO
where the volcanoes still play and their
drifting gases whorl in the thin lunar
atmosphere. There in some cavern
on a crater-side they will find shelter
for the first night of their march.
From Schroter’s valley strange
“ rivulets ” branch out into the sur¬
rounding deserts and there dwindle and
die. Whether they are sun-cracks or
old stream-beds, whether water still
flows—or ever flowed—in them will
be settled by our expedition in the next
moon-dawn. Then, down through the
Valley, the expedition will probably
pass out on a northwards march,
across the deserts of the Mare Imbrium,
with their far goals the passage of the
Tenerifle Mountains, the survey of
the great deep-sunken pit that is the
crater Plato, and the ultimate attain¬
ment of the Lunar North Pole.
One sits and plots a fascinating route
across the dim sun-glare of lands at
[90]
FUTURE OF EXPLORATION
the hither side of space. Looking
through the telescope at the strange,
unattained world a quarter of a million
miles away, that march and exploration
ceases to be an idle dream. Yet ordeals
at which we can only guess may delay
it. Those first explorers may never
attain Copernicus ; they may never
pass out of Eratosthenes. They may be
murdered by monsters, slain by giant
plants, asphyxiated in sudden ravines.
They may come on dagger-set plains
of glass, on heights where the air
fails completely, on pits and traps
beyond our concept. In lands beyond
human ken and human aid they will
adventure terribly.
That our satellite will ever remain
ultra-Arctic, bleak and forbidding, in
the eyes of the tourist, the colonist,
and the company promoter, seems
certain. If alien life can survive at
all upon its surface, it is unlikely to
[9i]
HANNO
flourish there. For ever lacking such
aids as aircraft or mechanically
propelled land transport, exploration
of the near moon-surface will take
many scores of years, while the farther
face, dark, unmapped, telescopically
invisible, is likely to long remain
untraversed by terrestrial caravans.
The inevitable triumph of ballistics
that will enable men to explore the lunar
deserts may soon elsewhere uprear
“ Upon the night’s starr’d face
Huge cloudy symbols of a high
romance.”
At the moment of writing, Mr. Robert
Condit, of Miami, Florida, has
announced his intention of attempting
to reach Venus within the next few
weeks. His apparatus, a “ rocket ”
to be propelled by the firing of
successive explosive chambers, is
reported to be almost completed. By
[92]
FUTURE OF EXPLORATION
the time these pages are in print,
Mr. Condit, in some Venusian jungle,
may be exhausting his camera supplies
and regretting the omission of a
machine-gun from his armoury. After
the moon, however, it is likely that
Mars will be the first extraterrestrial
body which the serious explorer will
attempt.
Within the next few years they of the
blood and tradition of Hanno, daring
the unknown in staggering voyage
forty million miles from home, may
yet attain the great Thaumasian desert,
drift in light aircraft across the reddish
sea-bottoms to the Solis Lucus, achieve
communication with the Areians of
the great oases, reach the Tithonian
Canal and follow its course down to the
Tithonian Lucus, drifting under the
bright Martian stars and the shrunken
Martian sun, above Nilotic strips of
swamp and cultivation and tawny
[93]
HANNO
waste; watch, in a creeping red
Martian twilight, the upspringing of
strange lights and infernal challenges.
Looking up at night upon the
untrodden starfields, it needs no robust
faith to believe that in the Future
of Exploration lies the Future of
Mankind.

'"THIS series of books, by some of the
1 most distinguished English thinkers,
scientists, philosophers, doctors, critics,
and artists, was at once recognized
as a noteworthy event. Written from
various points of view, one book frequently
opposing the argument of another, they
provide the reader with a stimulating
survey of the most modern thought in
many departments of life. Several
volumes are devoted to the future trend
of Civilization, conceived as a whole ;
while others deal with particular pro¬
vinces. It is interesting to see in these
neat little volumes, issued at a low price,
the revival of a form of literature, the
Pamphlet, which has been in disuse for
many years.
