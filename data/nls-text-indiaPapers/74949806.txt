Two samples were sent marked A and B. Sample A was said to be unheated, and sample B from the same source, but heated. Sample B was homogeneous, whereas sample A contained numerous white hard lumps. These lumps were found to be saponified higher fatty acids. The samples were undoubtedly genuine ghee, but the quality had apparently been injured in the process of preparation. Investigations.48 SECOND ANNUAL REPORT OF THE HARCOURT BUTLER INSTITUTE Water samples from Hlawga Lake and from the Irrawaddy River at Kemmendine have been tested regularly throughout the year to ascertain the occurrence of seasonal variation in Hydrogen Ion Concentration. Singularly little such variation has been found. The observations made are given at page 7. Malaria Bureau.5 OF PUBLIC HEALTHY RANGOON, FOR THE YEAR 1927. Kata Thermometer Readings, 1927.

On the same day four cartridges of dynamite of one ounce each were detonated together. The bank up to 75 feet away vibrated and the water shot up to about 20 feet, but though a few fish came floundering to the surface, no effects on larvae were noted. These experiments were therefore altogether negative, and the only explanation for it is that the water may have been too shallow, so that much of the force was expended upwards instead of laterally as probably occurred in Mesopotamia where bombs detonated deep in the river resulted in wholesale destruction of small fish.

RESOLUTION ON THE Report on the Working of the Harcourt Butler Institute of Public Health, Rangoon For the Year 1929. Extract from the Proceedings of the Government of Burma, Public Health Depart- ment,PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT( 2 ) I am glad to be able to report that the work of the Malaria Bureau continues active, and that valuable results are being obtained as a result of its formation, both in the way of investigation of malaria conditions in the Province and in introducing control measures. It is hoped that, when a full-time Director has been appointed, it may be found possible to manufacture at the Institute the large quanti- ties of cholera vaccine which are required for the Province. This should lead to a great saving in cost, but cannot be undertaken in the absence of a full-time Director. My thanks are due to Major Bilderbeck and Dr. Anklesaria who were the Directors during the year and all the staff of the Institute for their efforts to make the Institute a success. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, G. JOLLY, Lieut.-Col., I.M.S., Offg. Director of Public Health, Burma.

A small investigation into the jumping powers of various species of rats was commenced and completed during the year, and the results will be published shortly. 3. Under the orders of the Director of Public Health prophylactic sensitised Anti-Dysenteric Vaccine containing 500 millions of sensitised Shiga Bacilli and 500 millions Flexner (unsensitised) to the c.c. was prepared at the Institute and issued to three jails in the Province. This vaccine was prepared in exactly the same manner as that prepared by Dr. Otto Schobl, c/o Bureau of Science, Manilla, Phillippine Islands, as its use as a protection against Dysentery was advocated by workers in those Islands. It was used for the first time in Burma in 1929 and the results obtained from its use in one of the jails where it was given a fair trial among 1,200 convicts (600 of whom were inoculated, and 600 uninoculated) were promising in that there was a 50 per cent. reduction in the incidence of the disease among the inoculated as compared with the control cases. The use of this vaccine did not affect the mortality rate among the two groups; 4,200 c.c. of this vaccine were prepared and 3,375 c.c. issued during the year. It is intended to give this vaccine a further trial on a more extensive scale. 4. The Rangoon River water was examined with a view to determin- ing the salinity at different tides and at different periods of the year. Twenty-eight samples in all were analysed and the results of examination forwarded to the Admiralty Oil Fuel Depôt at King's Bank, Rangoon, 5. An investigation into the composition ofngapi, a national food- stuff among the Burmese prepared from fish, shrimps and prawns was carried out with a view to determining the amount of adulteration and the caloric value. Two hundred and thirty-four samples of ngapi in all were collected from the whole Province, with the assistance of Divisional Commissioners, District Officers, etc., who also intimated the mode of manufacture peculiar to their own districts. Twenty-four different varieties of ngapi which are more likely to be adulterated and in which the adulterants are less likely to be detected were examined and the results will be published in due course. 6. A small investigation into the purity of quinine preparations imported into Burma was also carried out. Samples were purchased from different druggist shops and some were received from the Collector of Customs, Rangoon. Of the 19 samples imported from the United Kingdom, Holland, Germany, Java and New York which were examined all were found to conform to declaration on the labels. 7. Adulteration of Ghee.OF PUBLIC HEALTH, RANGOON, FOR THE YEAR 1929. 5 of pure buffalo ghee prepared personally by Mr. Moitra, B.Sc., F.C.S., the Assistant Chemist. The information obtained was interesting and a full report on this subject is expected to be published separately in due course. 8. A small piece of research on the bacteriological findings in the chlorinated water supply of a large city was commenced during the year and completed early in 1930. The report will also be published shortly. Malaria Bureau.6 FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE HARCOURT BUTLER INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC HEALTH, RANGOON, FOR THE YEAR 1929.

Extract from the Proceedings of the Government of Burma, Public Health Department,PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT.( 2 ) 5. The Rangoon Rat Flea Survey, initiated in 1928, is nearing com- pletion, and the results of the Port Area have been sent for publication in the Indian Journal of Medical Research. Summaries of the results obtained in the other parts of the town have been sent to the Secretary, Scientific Advisory Board, Indian Research Fund Association. 6. Last year the Corporation of Rangoon accepted my proposals to carry out a mosquito survey of the town in collaboration with their health staff. This was begun on the 1st of April 1930 and was com- pleted on the 30th November.

A tea party was arranged on the 22nd November 1935 on the grounds of this Institute, by the Burma Branch of the Indian Red Cross Society, in honour of Dr. Ruth Young, Director of the Maternity and Child Welfare Bureau, Indian Red Cross Society. Dr. Young visited Burma as external examiner for the Burma Health School examination, and also did a tour of inspection of the Child Welfare centres in the Province. 3. VISITORS.4 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE HARCOURT BUTLER Examination of rats. Stocking and looking after animals. Bacteriological examination of water for the determination of its potability consisted in (a) determining the total number of aerobic bacteria per cubic centimetre of water, (b) the least quantity fermenting McConkey bile salt lactose broth, (c) presence or absence of Cl. welchii in 20 c.c. of water, (d) identification according to Clemesha's classifica- tion of those lactose fermenting organisms found present. The last test is done only in the case of a water showing the presence of lactose fermenters in less than 50 c.c. The examination of the majority of the samples of water according to the above requirements takes about eight days for completion. The table below shows the number of water samples examined during the year and their sources. TABLE. PUBLIC WATER SAMPLES.

Eight samples of water were sent to be examined for the presence of cholera vibrio. All were negative except one sample, from which an organism simulating the cholera vibrio was isolated, but it did not agglutinate with stock high titre serum. Twenty-one samples of shaving brushes of different manufacture were sent by the Customs Department to be examined for the presence of anthrax bacillus; on no occasion was this organism found. Four samples of disinfectants were tested for their carbolic acid coefficient. Out of these, three samples were received from the Police Supplies Depôt, Rangoon. It must be noted here that this examination gives only a comparative result, as it is not possible to maintain standard requirements for the Rideal Walker test in this laboratory at present. Bacterial emulsions of the typhoid and paratyphoid group of organisms were prepared in accordance with instructions detailed in the Medical Council Research Series No. 51. Preparation of high titre agglutinating sera was started for the first time in this laboratory this year. In previous years, such sera had to be purchased from the Pasteur Institute of Burma.

A piece of spleen of a dead rat was also sent to this Institute for examination. The spleen sent was macerated in saline and injected into a guinea pig subcutaneously. The guinea pig at autopsy showed the typical post mortem appearance of plague and Pr. pestis was isolated. The guinea pig was mounted and kept in the museum of this Institute. A dead N. Bengalensis was sent by Messrs. Fairweather Richard Co. The smear from the spleen showed organisms which closely resembled, morphologically, Pr. pestis, while the post mortem signs were not like those of a plague rat. Cultural tests and animal inocula- tion showed that the organism concerned was Pr. murisseptica. This stresses the point that mere examination of a smear is not always sufficient to diagnose the presence of Pr. pestis in rats. This fact was brought to the notice of the Director of Public Health, Burma, and the Health Officer, Corporation of Rangoon, and it has been decided that in future any dead rat showing signs and symptoms of plague will be sent to this Institute from the laboratory of the Corporation of Rangoon for the verification of the diagnosis by further cultural and animal tests.
INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC HEALTH, RANGOON, FOR THE YEAR 1936. 9 19. INSTRUCTION.10 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE HARCOURT BUTLER Incidences of rat fall are usually recorded before a plague epidemic starts among human beings. But a crocidura fall has never been recorded in spite of these animals having a high cheopis index. The following investigation was carried out in this laboratory to find the resistance of this animal to Pr. pestis infection. SHORT DESCRIPTION.INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC HEALTH, RANGOON, FOR THE YEAR 1936. 11 to live in complete darkness. Crocidura fed on rice or bread and kept in an ordinary lighted room died in a few days. This difficulty was, however, overcome by feeding them with meat and keeping the cage in a dark room. The experiment was carried out only after the C. Coerulea had been kept alive under observation for at least a week and the indigenous house rat (M. Concolor) was used as a control. In all, nine C. Coeruleas were used. The technique adopted was as follows:12 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE HARCOURT BUTLER final test for the concentration of SO2 was done the following morning at 10-30 a.m., the result being 0.5 per cent. The inside of the room in the morning appeared to be quite clear, no trace of smoke being visible. The room was opened at 10-40 a.m. It took about 45 minutes before one could get inside the room to examine thoroughly the result of fumigation. All the animals and insects were found dead. The effect of sulphur fumigation on rat fleas deserves special attention. On combing the dead rats, dead fleas were recovered from every one of them. This indicates that the fleas died either before the death of the rats or that both the rats and their fleas died at the same time. If the fleas had remained alive for any length of time after the death of the rats they would have certainly left the carcases. Other changes that were noticed after the experiment were as follows:INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC HEALTH, RANGOON, FOR THE YEAR 1936. 13 19 times in the 367 samples of water bacteriologically examined, and in the majority of cases there was some indication of pollution of the water source with alvine discharges of either human beings or cattle or wild animals. Whether this organism is present in bird droppings has still got to be proved. The presence of B. Schafferi in a certain water sample to which birds only had access, strongly suggests the likelihood of this organism being present in bird droppings. Experiments were carried out on two different lines to find the resistance of this organisms to sunlight. EXPERIMENT I.14 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE HARCOURT BUTLER allowed to associate with 6 other healthy rats. Out of the 2 fed rats 1 died after an interval of 7 days and the other 16 days from the date of feeding. Out of the 6 healthy rats 2 rats died after an interval of 9 days and 1 died after 14 days. The remaining 3 rats did not show any sign of illness and were destroyed after about 4 weeks. EXPERIMENT No. II.INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC HEALTH, RANGOON, FOR THE YEAR 1936. 15 VIII. Investigation on an outbreak of an epidemic associated with high mortality at Udo Village (Taikkyi Township). On receipt of information about an epidemic at Udo Village, the Assistant Bacteriologist was sent away to investigate the matter. On his arrival at the village he could not find any body suffering from the disease complained of. However, evidence was collected which pointed to the fact that the patients who had already suffered from this alimentary disturbances had been in fact attacked with cholera. Nine cases of death within a period of 8 days had occurred and the cause of death had been recorded as death due to fever. On being aware of these facts the Assistant Bacteriologist inoculated 509 people with prophylactic cholera vaccine. No further attack was reported after this incidence.

The result of the survey with recommendations, was embodied in a report, which was duly submitted to the Director of Public Health, Burma, for disposal. (4) A survey was also carried out to find out the suitability of the site for the proposed Tuberculosis Sanatorium near Kalaw, Southern Shan States. The site was found to be malarious and unsuitable for housing tubercular patients. (5) A malaria survey of Sandoway town was carried out from 21st June to 10th November 1936. The survey was started by the late Lieutenant E. S. Feegrade, I.M.D., Malariologist, and was concluded by Dr. U Tin, on account of Dr. Feegrade falling sick. The survey revealed that malaria exists in low endemic form in the centre of town and in high endemic form towards the periphery. The anopheline mosquitoes found to be concerned in the trans- mission of malaria were A. Culicifacies, A. Maculatus and A. Minimus. A detailed survey report is now in the press. 25.
