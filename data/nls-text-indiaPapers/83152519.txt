Lieut.2 Discharges. 3. 56 patients were discharged against 64 last year, 33 as cured, 12 improved, 1 not improved and 10 otherwise. Of those discharged otherwise 9 (8 males and 1 female) were transferred to the list of non-criminals and 1 transferred to the Mental Hospital, Lahore. Cases under observation. 4. One case remained under observation on 1st January 1927, 41 including 1 re-admission were admitted during the year against 42 last year. Of these 42, 27 were certified as insanes and admitted, 3 were discharged by the Magistrate although certified ; 8 were uncertified as they exhibited no symptoms of lunacy ; 2 died and 2 remained at the close of the year. Sickness and mortality. 5. The mortality during the year was 19 against 23 last year, giving a percentage of 4.62 against 5.79 last year. The principal causes of deaths were :3 Bombay, 10.72 in Assam, 8.31 in the United Provinces, 7.24 in Madras, 5.51 in Burma, 4.62 in European Mental Hospital, Ranchi and 3.12 in Indian Mental Hospital, Kanke Ranchi (Bihar and Orissa). Ankylostome infection. 6. Of new admissions 6.57 per cent were already infect- ed against 12.5 last year. The usual treatment (Manson's mixture) was carried out at half yearly intervals. Of the 421 stools examined from separate admissions ankylostomes were detected in 26 cases. These were given combined treatment of chenopodium oil and carbon tetrachloride, and the results were quite good. Other helminths found were:4 STATEMENT No. VII.

Diseases of the nervous system ... 2 2 Other bodily afflictions ... 1 ... No cause ascertained due to defective history. ... 32 24 STATEMENT No. VIII. Finance. 11. The total amount spent for the upkeep of the Mental Hospital was Rs. 1,13,140-11-7 against Rs. 1,06,774-3-1 last year. Out of this Rs. 6,941-12-6 were spent by the Public Works Department on annual repairs and additions and alterations to the existing buildings. Excluding this amount and other book adjustments the expenditure was Rs. 1,05,679-9-1 against Rs. 1,03,155-3-10 last year. The increase is due to the additional supply of articles of food neces- sitated by the increased number of admissions and purchase of more vegetables and grass than that in the last year owing to the failure of the garden produce and farm (grass reserve area). Receipts from paying patients amounted to Rs. 11,555-0-4 against Rs. 9,369-3-8 and the receipts from other sources Rs. 2,464-15-3 against Rs. 5,233-14-6. The average cost of diet and clothing of a lunatic was Rs. 101 against Rs. 101 last year. STATEMENT No . IX. Establishment. 12. The establishment remained unchanged during the year under report.
5 STATEMENT No. X. Profit and Loss. 13. Profits during the year were Rs. 5,009-6-3 against Rs. 11,169-4-6 last year. The increase last year was due to the auction of surplus cattle, etc., as stated in that year's report. This year profit from the sale of flowers was reduced and the crop of vegetables and grass was poor as mentioned in paragraph 11 above. First Aid Training. 14. A batch of five male attendants was trained and passed in First Aid. Amusements, etc. 15. Gramophone entertainments were given and sweets distributed on Hindu, Christian and Mohammedan festivals. In and out-door games to those taking interest in them were allowed. Rewards in the shape of sweets and other petty articles to hard working and deserving patients were as usual given during the year. General remarks. 16. Administrative approval of the Local Government to Stage I plans and estimate, the latter amounting to Rs. 52,600 for the con- struction of a ward for 20 non-paying patients and of 6 blocks for paying patients with cook-rooms, etc., has been conveyed in Medical Administration and Public Health Department No. 5627-980-IX, dated the 22nd November 1927. In this connection I consider that the spending of a few thousand rupees more and locating these new paying wards on the entrance side of the Hospital instead of behind would be justified and with this end in view I shall examine the question again. The outstanding feature of the year is the insistent demand for accommodation which cannot be met but which has to some extent been mitigated by refusing admissions to all non-violent cases. This problem cannot be shelved; one way of solving it is by adding more wards ; this is being done ; another is by decreasing the average stay of patients in hospital, i.e., curing some of them quicker. Recent investi- gations show that chronic focal sepsis is responsible not only for such common ailments as rheumatism and gastric ulcer, but is largely, sometimes solely, responsible for mental dis- orders of the type most frequently met with viz., manic depressive psychoneurosis and toxic insanity ; where this problem has been dealt with vigorously the results have been astonishing. In one large Mental Hospital in America the
6 number of discharges was doubled and the average stay in hospital reduced from ten to three months. This focal sepsis is in the teeth and tonsils in 70 to 80 per cent of cases. I am submitting proposals separately to establish a dental department and for the engagement of a throat specialist to carry out treatment on the lines suggested. It seems that money spent in this fashion must yield good results. Staff. 17. Rao Bahadur K. G. Paonasker has gone on leave pending retirement after many years' association with the Hospital in which he was keenly interested. The rest of the staff has maintained its good record- A blank audit speaks well for an institution of this description- 18. As Superintendent of the Mental Hospital Lieut.- Colonel W. Tarr, I.M.S., carried out his duties with marked zeal and efficiency. J. NORMAN WALKER, M. R. C. P. (Lond.), D. T. M. & 11.

Agents for the sale of Publications issued by the Central Provinces Government. [NOTEAnnual Report on the Mental Hospital, Nagpur, for the year 1928. Lieut.-Colonel W. Tarr, I.M.S., was in charge through- out the year under report. STATEMENT No. I. Population. 2. 409 (322 males and 87 females) patients were under treatment at the beginning of the year. 73 (57 males and 16 females). including 11 readmissions (10 males and 1 female) were admitted during the year, making a total of 482 (379 males and 103 females). The number of patients at the close of the year was 414 (322 males and 92 females) including 116 criminals (104 males and 12 females) against 409 and 116, respectively, last year. The Nagpur district as usual contributed the largest number of admissions, i.e., 17 (14 males and 3 females), Jubbulpore 11, Amraoti 6, Bilaspur, Wardha, Akola and Buldana 5 from each district (i.e., 20 from last 4 districts), and the rest were from other districts of the Province and Central India. The number of admissions on reception order on petition under section 10 of Act IV of 1912, was 7 against 5 last year and 1 was admitted as a voluntary boarder. Accommodation. 3. The total accommodation provided was 438 (312 males and 126 females) and the largest number accommodated on any one night was 420 (326 males and 94 females), i.e., 14 in excess of the proper accommodation on the male side. Over- crowding was avoided by permitting a few to sleep in the verandahs at night. Owing to the overcrowding the Local Government issued orders restricting admissions of non-dangerous male patients into the hospital last year and the same orders have been applied this year. It also sanctioned the construction of a barrack for 20 non-pay- ing male patients and 6 blocks for 12 paying patients; the barrack and accommodation for 4 paying patients were nearly completed by the end of the year. The number of patients paying Rs. 30 and over at the close of the year was 9 against 7 last year,
2 Discharges. 4. 39 patients were discharged against 56 last year, 20 as cured, 10 (8 males and 2 females) improved, 1 (male) not improved, and 8 otherwise. Of those discharged otherwise 7 (6 males and 1 female) were transferred to non-criminal class and 1 male sent to the Mental Hospital, Lahore. Cases under observation. 5. Two cases remained under observation on 1st January 1928 ; 28 including 2 remain- ing were admitted during the year against 41 last year. Of these 28, 10 were certified as insanes and admitted, 1 was discharged by the Magistrate although certified, 16 were uncertified as they exhibited no symptoms of insanity and 1 remained at the close of the year. Sickness and Mortality. 6. The mortality during the year was 29 against 19 last year, giving a percentage of 7.04 against 4.62 last year. The principal causes of deaths were exhaustion due to acute mania 2, bacillary dysentery 6, dysentery due to balantidium coli 1, dysentery amoebic 1, colitis 1, pul- monary tuberculosis 4, emphysema lungs 1, pneumonia 2, anorexia 1, epilepsy 1, pernicious anaemia 4, heart failure 2, moist gangrene 1, general debility 2. It has always been a problem to prevent the incidence of dysentery and colitis owing to the coprophagic and geophagic habits of the patients. The open drains inside the hospital area have also been the sources of infection for many and it is suggested that steps be taken to cover them. The period of stay of these patients in hospital was as under .3 from pulmonary tuberculosis two were suffering from the disease during the time of their admission. The death rate per cent for 1928 in Mental Hospitals in other provinces in India was 5.54 in Burma, 9.13 in Assam, 8.34 in the United Provinces, 3.45 in the Indian Mental Hospital, Kanke, Ranchi, and 4.60 in European Mental Hospital, Ranchi (Bihar and Orissa), 10.64 in the Punjab, 9.2 in Bombay, and 6.92 in Madras. Ankylostome infection. 7. Of new admissions 4.84 per cent were already infected against 6.57 last year. The usual treatment (Manson's mixture) was carried out at half yearly intervals. Of 434 stools examined from separate admissions ankylostomes were detected in 40 patients. It has also been noticed that this infection was more common amongst those patients who worked in the vegetable gardens of the hospital. Other helminths found were4 Next was Melancholia with 19 admissions and 12 discharges. Under errors of development the admis- sions were 4, under circular insanity 3, Insanity due to acute infective diseases (Encephalitis Lethargica) 1, Exhaustion Psychosis 1, Cannabis indica 3 and under Demetia Praecox 8. STATEMENT No. VII. Aetiological factors and associated conditions. 11. The principal predisposing and exciting causes were : 5 Throat work. They started work at the beginning of May. In the dental department card registers have been introduced. It is intended that these will form a dental history of patients from the time of admission as is done in recruits for the Army, and that periodical inspections of each patient will be made to maintain as far as possible a healthy condition of the mouth. STATEMENT No. X. Profit and loss. 14. Profits during the year were Rs. 4,528-2-0 against Rs. 5,009-6-3 last year, the decrease is due to the failure of the grass crop and garden produce owing to shortage of rain at the proper season. Amusements. 15. These were provided in the shape of in and out-door games, music by gramo- phones and special feasts during the Hindu, Mohammedan and Christian festivals. Buildings. 16. As previously mentioned, construction of one dormitory for 20 patients and 2 blocks for 4 paying patients was undertaken by the Public Works Department and these were nearly completed towards the end of the year, so that at the beginning of the year 1929 the available accommodation will be for 336 males and 126 females. General remarks. 17. A proportion of the inmates in the hospital is literate and arrangements are being made to establish a library for them. An appeal through newspapers to the general public to contribute towards it is being made. Staff. 18. All members of the staff did their work satis- factorily, and a blank audit speaks well for an institution of this des- cription. 19. As Superintendent of the Mental Hospital Lieut.- Colonel W. Tarr, I.M.S., carried out his duties with marked zeal and efficiency. J. NORMAN WALKER, M.R.C.P. (Lond.), D.T.M. & H.

Nagpur, the 5th August 1930. READ2 to be less than had been anticipated. There was no other change in the establishment. Government will watch with interest the effect of these measures in increasing the number of discharges and reducing the period of stay in hospital. 3. The number of admissions to the hospital showed a tendency to decline. During the triennium 250 patients were admitted as against 283 in the previous triennium. This was partly due to the more careful observance of the rules for the administration of the Indian Lunacy Act by magistrates. The number of persons discharged was 140 as against 165 in the previous triennium. Out of 250 admissions, in only four cases was insanity attributed directly to ganja, as against five in the previous triennium, while in 31 cases as against 49 in the years 1924 to 1926, ganja was a predisposing or exciting cause. Alcoholism on the other hand was an ætiological factor in only two cases, as against 11 in the previous three years. 4. The health of the patients was on the whole satis- factory. The number of deaths in the triennium rose from 61 to 76. The percentage of deaths on the average strength of inmates was 6.07 as compared with 5.31 and 7.89, respectively, in the two preceding periods. These figures compare favourably with those of the Mental Hospitals in Bombay, Madras, Assam and the Punjab. The relatively low mortality from tuberculosis continued; this disease being responsible for only seven deaths in the three years under review. 5. The average cost of feeding and clothing each patient per annum was Rs. 101 in 1927, Rs. 107 in 1928 and Rs. 115 in 1929. The increase is due to the issue of extra diets to invalids and debilitated patients. Receipts from paying patients amounted to Rs. 13,593 in 1929, against Rs. 10,118 in 1928 and Rs. 11,555 in 1927. 6. During the three years under review the Board of visitors has met regularly and continued to show interest in the management of the hospital. Government desires to acknowledge the good work done by the whole staff and especially the ability and zeal with which
3 Lt.-Col. W. Tarr, I.M.S., discharged his duty of superin- tendence of the hospital for the first two years of the triennium His successor Dr. J. Roy has had a success- ful first year's work. ORDER.Annual Report on the Mental Hospital in the Central Provinces and Berar (Nagpur) for the year 1929. Administration. 1. Lieut.-Colonel W. Tarr, I.M.S., was in charge up to 15th March 1929, and Dr. J. Roy, M.B., D.P.M. (Eng.), for the remaining period of the year. STATEMENT No. I. Population. 2. The number of patients resident at the hospital at the beginning of the year was 322 males and 92 females or a total of 414. The admissions (including 1 readmission) during the year were 90 (76 males and 14 females) against 73 (57 males and 16 females) in the preceding year. There was 1 case of readmission in the female section against 11 (10 males and 1 female) in the preceding year. The total population of the hospital during the year was 504 against 482 in the previous year, giving an increase of 22. This hospital receives patients only from the Central Provin- ces and Berar and from Central India. Of the new ad- missions, the Nagpur district as usual contributed the largest number, i.e., 38 (28 males and 10 females) against 17 (14 males and 3 females) in the preceding year. The daily average strength of the total population, excluding the observation cases, was 426.44 (333.57 males and 92.87 females) against 411.76 (320.40 males and 91.36 females) in the previous year. Including the observation cases the daily average strength was 428.88 against 412.95 in the previous year. The ratio per cent of cases "cured" to daily average strength was 8.09 males and 8.61 females, total 8.20 for both sexes against 6.24 males and nil fe- males, total 4.85 in the previous year. The ratio per cent of cases "cured" to new admis- sions was 17.10 males and 35.72 females, total 20.00 against 14.03 males and nil females, total 10.96 in the previous year. Accommodation. 3. One barrack for 20 non-paying male patients and two wards for 4 paying patients were taken over from the Public Works Department early in the year, thus the total accommodation provided was 462 (336 males and 126
2 females) against 438 (312 males and 126 females) in the previous year. Four more wards for 8 paying patients were nearly completed by the end of the year so that for the year 1930 the accommodation available would be for 470 patients. The question of further increase in the accommoda- tion, especially for paying and better class patients in the female section, is under consideration. The maximum number resident in the hospital on any one night was 439 (346 males and 93 females) against 420 (326 males and 94 females) in the previous year. The accommodation available in the male section being for only 336 there was thus an excess of 10 patients. Discharges. 4. Forty-five patients were discharged against 39 in the previous year, 35 as cured, 5 improved and 5 otherwise. Of those discharged otherwise, 1 was repatriated to Calicut and 1 to Bengal and 1 escaped. The remaining 2 and the 5 cases "improved" were taken over by their rela- tives. Cases under observation. 5. One case remained under observation on 1st January 1929 ; 62, including 1 re- maining, were admitted against 28 last year. Of these, 32 were certified as insanes, 3 were discharged by the Court on security, 3 were uncertified as they exhibited no symptoms of insanity and 21 not being dangerous were not certified, 1 remained at the close of the year. Two cases brought in a moribund condition died. Sickness and mortality. 6. The mortality during the year was 28 against 29 last year, giving a percentage of 6.56 against 7.04 last year. The causes of deaths were3 The following table shows the period of stay in hospi- tal of these patients : 4 of these 125 patients, 15 recovered, but they could not be discharged as their cases are governed by the princi- ples laid down in Book Circular V-l, Appendix II. STATEMENT No. III. Religion, sex and residence STATEMENT No. IV. Previous occupation. STATEMENT No. V. Age. 9. These need no special comment. STATEMENT No. VI. Types of insanity. 10. Mania under its various sub-heads was as usual the commonest type of insanity. Admissions and discharges under this head were 41 and 27 against 27 and 18, respectively, last year. Next was melancholia with 10 admissions and 7 discharges and exhaustion psychoses with 9 admissions and 7 discharges. Under dementia præcox the admis- sion were 11, errors of development 6, paranoia 2, and one each under dementia from local cerebral syphilis, senile psychoses and circular insanity. 11. The principal predisposing and exciting causes amongst the new admissions were : 5 expenditure is mainly due to (1) Public Works Depart- ment charges for construction of new buildings and repairs which were Rs. 37,521 against Rs. 23,376 in the previous year; (2) increased expenditure under establishment, viz., Rs. 31,715 against Rs. 28,766 due to the appointment of a whole-time Superintendent; (3) increased expend- iture under "Diet" and "Contingencies proper" due to (a) increase in number of patients treated and (b) issue of extra diets to invalids and debilitated patients. The average cost of "Diet and clothing" per patient per annum was Rs. 115 against Rs. 107 last year, i.e., an increase of about 11 annas per patient per month. Receipts from paying patients amounted to Rs. 13,593 against Rs. 10,118 in the previous year and the receipts from other sources were Rs. 2,783 against Rs. 2,193. The value of stores received from the manufacturing depart- ment less cost of raw materials was Rs. 12,879 against Rs. 10,431 of last year. STATEMENT No. IX. Establishment. 14. The post of a whole-time Superintendent was created, the Alienist being appoint- ed to that post, and the temporary post of Nose and Throat Specialist was abolished, other- wise there was no change. STATEMENT No. X. Profit and loss. 15. Profits during the year under review were Rs. 5,213 against 4,528 in the pre- vious year. Buildings. 16. As mentioned in paragraph 3 of the report, the question of further increase in accommodation is under considera- tion. A most important work which must be taken in hand immediately is the improvement of the present gar- den water-supply as there was great scarcity of garden water last year. The question of fencing in more of the hospital land to allow of more cultivation and the saving of grass for fodder is also very necessary. Last year for about 2 months fresh vegetables had to be purchased from the market and a large quantity of fodder for the cattle was bought during the year. Visitors. 17. The official and non-official visitors attended the monthly meetings regularly. The Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals visited the hospital twice during the year.
6 General remarks. 18. As a result of an appeal by the Superintendent through newspapers several gentle- men and clubs very kindly present- ed a large collection of books, periodicals, etc., and these have formed a nucleus for a library for the patients which are appreciated very much. Thanks are accorded to all of them, especially to Sergeant-Major C. Fell, Honorary Secretary, Nagpur Regimental Club, to Khan Bahadur H. M. Willaitullah, I.S.O., Retired Deputy Commis- sioner, and to Dr. L. M. Sen, the late Health Officer of Nagpur. Thanks are also accorded to the management of the Bengalee of Calcutta for sending gratis throughout the year one copy of the Daily Edition, to the management of the Tarun Bharat and to the Varad Shala Patrak for send- ing one copy of their issues throughout the year free of all charges. Staff. 19. All members of the staff did their work satisfac- torily. Special mention is made of the work of Mrs. W. Milton, officiating matron, who by her natural kindness, tact and cheerful temperament, gained the confidence of even the acute paranoiacs. 20. As Superintendent of the Mental Hospital Dr. Roy carried out his duties satisfactorily. W. V.

Agents for the sale of Publications issued by the Central Provinces Government. [NOTE.Annual Report on the Mental Hospital in the Central Provinces and Berar (Nagpur) for the year 1930. Administration. 1. Dr. J. ROY, M.B., D.P.M. (Eng.), was in charge throughout the year except for the period he was on leave from 15th April 1930 to 26th June 1930, when Major J. M. R. Hennessy, I.M.S., Civil Surgeon, Nagpur, held the charge. STATEMENT No. I. Population. 2. The number of patients resident at the hospital at the beginning of the year was 340 males and 91 females, or a total of 431. The admissions (including 1 readmission and 1 voluntary boarder) during the year were 79 (66 males and 13 females) against 90 (76 males and 14 females) in the preceding year. There was 1 case of readmission against the same number in the preceding year. The total population of the hospital during the year was 510 against 504 in the previous year, giving an increase of 6. This hospital receives patients only from the Central Provinces and Berar and from Central India. Of the new admissions, the Nagpur district as usual contributed the largest number, i.e., 20 (13 males and 7 females) against 38 (28 males and 10 females) in the preceding year. The daily average strength of the total population, excluding the observa- tion cases, was 423.54 (332.99 males and 90.55 females) against 426.44 (333.57 males and 92.87 females) in the previous year. Including the observation cases the daily average strength was 425.76 against 428.88 in the pre- vious year. The ratio per cent of cases " cured " to daily average strength was 11.71 males and 5.52 females, total 10.38 for both sexes against 8.09 males and 8.61 females, total 8.20 for both sexes in the previous year. The ratio per cent of cases " cured " to new admis- sions was 22.72 males and 15.38 females, total 21.51 against 17.10 males and 35.72 females, total 20.00 in the previous year. Accommodation. 3. Four wards for 8 paying patients were taken over from the Public Works Depart- ment early in the year, thus the total accommodation provided was 470 (344 males and 126 females), against 462 (336 males and 126 females), in the previous year. The proposal of further increase in the accom- modation, for paying and better class of patients in the
2 female section, which was under consideration, has been held over on account of financial stringency. The maximum number resident in the hospital on any one night was 436 (341 males and 95 females) against 439 (346 males and 93 females) in the previous year. There was no overcrowding. Discharges. 4. Sixty-one patients were discharged against 45 in the previous year, 44 as cured, 10 improved, and 7 discharged other- wise. Of those " discharged otherwise" 5 who were criminal patients escaped, of whom 3 were " recovered" insane criminals and were employed as supervisors in charge of patients working in outside fields and gardens. They broke their parole and escaped. The remaining 2 and the 10 improved cases were taken over by their relatives. Cases under observa- tion. 5. One case remained under observation on 1st January 1930, 39 were sent for observation against 61 last year. Of these 40, 23 were certified as insanes, 2 were discharged by the Court on security, 6 were uncertified as they exhibited no symptoms of insanity and 5 not being dangerous were not certified, 4 remained at the close of the year. Sickness and mortality. 6. The mortality during the year was 36 against 28 last year, giving a percentage of 8.49 against 6.56 last year. The causes of deaths were3 Out of 7 deaths under 1 year's stay, 6 were received in a very bad state of health, and the physical condition of the other was indifferent. The general health of the patients during the year was good. The daily average sick was 22.51 against 34.96 last year. All the patients and the staff were vaccinated against small-pox and were inoculated against cholera as prophylactic measures. During the hot weather and the monsoons the drinking water was chlorinated. Potassium permanganate was also used. There was no epidemic disease. The death rate per cent for 1930 in mental hospitals in other provinces in India was 9.02 in the Punjab, 8.1 in Bombay, 7.41 in Madras, 6.92 in the European Mental Hospital, Ranchi, 6.46 in the United Provinces, 6.09 in Burma, 3.94 in Assam and 2.07 in the Indian Mental Hospital, Ranchi. Ankylostome infection. 7. Of the new admissions, 12.66 per cent were already infected against 4.44 per cent in the previous year Routine examination of stools of all patients was carried on periodi- cally and 29 patients were found to have been infected with ankylostome while resident in the hospital against 19 last year. As noted in the previous year, infection from ankylostome and dysentery (bacillary) was common amongst the patients working in the garden. In spite of every care and supervision some of these patients get the infection from their coprophagic and geophagic habits. Other helminths found were ascaris lumbricoids 19, trichurus trichura 8, oxyuris vermicularis 4. STATEMENT No. II. Criminal insanes and insane criminals. 8. The number of criminal insanes and insane criminals at the beginning of the year was 125 (113 males and 12 females). The number admitted during the year under review was 18 including 1 readmission against 23 in the preceding year. Twenty were discharged and 6 died and the number remaining under care and treat- ment towards the close of the year was 117 against 125 last year. Out of these 117 patients, 11 males and 1 female recovered but they could not be discharged as their cases are governed by the principles laid down in Book Circular Part V-I Appendix II.
4 STATEMENT No. III. Religion, sex and re- sidence. STATEMENT No. IV. Previous occupation. STATEMENT No. V. Age. 9. These need no special comment. STATEMENT No. VI. Types of insanity. 10. Mania under its various sub-heads was as usual the commonest type of insanity. Admissions and discharges under this head were 40 and 29 against 41 and 27, respectively, last year. Next was melancholia with 8 admissions and 10 discharges and exhaustion psychoses with 8 admissions and 5 discharges. Under dementia praecox, the admis- sions were 14, errors of development 4, and 1 each under paranoia, infective and toxic insanity, dementia secondary to organic cerebral disease other than syphilis STATEMENT No. VII. Aetiological factors and associated conditions. 11. The principal predisposing and exciting causes amongst the new admissions were :5 cultivation had not been done on any large scale due firstly to the fact that the hospital land being unfenced the crop and other farm produce could not be protected from depredations by cattle, and secondly due to inadequacy of staff. Owing to the general financial stringency there was little hope of monetary assistance. So the Superintendent without waiting for the better times undertook to fence in the arable land in plots with cactus and other thorny plants. During the year under review a plot of over 40 acres was thus adequately protected and cultivated entirely with the help of the patients. The result has been very satisfactory : regulated exercise and outdoor work improved the general health of patients and there was an increase in the percentage of cures. In addition a stock of one month's consumption of juwar and toor dal, about 30 maunds of cotton and a large quantity of fodder for cattle has been raised which will be used for the hospital next year. Weaving work was also undertaken but owing to the absence of expert supervision, much could not be done. (ii) Hydrotherapy (prolonged bathing). For want of staff, this form of treatment could not be done in a systematic way. (iii) Psychotherapy by psychoanalysis. Two cases were treated by psychoanalysis, one of whom a voluntary boarder suffering from anxiety hysteria recovered completely and went home. From later reports it was learnt that she continued to remain perfectly well The other case suffering from conversion hysteria recovered sufficiently to be able to return to her home. Amusements and ames. These were provided in the shape of in and out-door games, music by gramophones and special feasts during the Hindu, Muhammadan and Christian festivals. STATEMENT No.VIII. Finance. 14. The total amount spent for the up-keep of the Mental Hospital was in round figures Rs. 1,18,582 against Rs. 1,56,425 in the previous year. The decrease is mainly due to less expenditure by the Public Works Department which was Rs. 5,247 against Rs. 37,521 in the previous year. The average cost of "diet and clothing" per patient per annum was Rs. 117 against Rs. 115 last year, i.e., an increase of about 3 annas per patient per month.
6 Receipts from paying patients amounted to Rs. 10,334 against Rs. 13,593 in the previous year and the receipts from other sources were Rs. 1,198 against Rs. 2,783. The value of stores received from the manufacturing department including garden and farm, less cost of raw materials was Rs. 14,436 against Rs. 12,879 of last year. STATEMENT No. IX. Establishment. 15. There was no change in the establishment except that Mrs. L. Brodie, Matron, retired from service during the year on invalid pension and Mrs. W. Milton has been appoint- ed in her place. STATEMENT No. X. Profit and loss. 16. Profits during the year under review were Rs. 6,704 against Rs. 5,213 in the previous year. Buildings, etc. 17. A new well was constructed during the year in place of the old one rendered un- serviceable. Scarcity of water-supply for the gardens is still acute. Two more wells are badly needed. Visitors. 18. Official and non-official visitors attended the monthly meetings regularly. The Commissioner, Nagpur division, visited the hospital during the year. General remarks. 19. Thanks are accorded to the management of the Bengalee of Calcutta for sending gratis throughout the year one copy of the Daily Edition. Thanks are also due to Khan Bahadur H. M. Willaitullah, I.S.O., retired Deputy Commissioner, for presenting periodicals to the hospital library. Staff. 20. All members of the staff did their work satis- factorily. Mrs. W. Milton who has now been appointed permanently as Matron continued to work with marked zeal and efficiency. 21. As Superintendent of the Mental Hospital Dr. Roy carried out his duties in a satisfactory manner. W. TARR, M.D., F.R.C.S.E., D.P.H., I.M.S., Offg.

The number of patients resident at the hospital at the beginning of the year was 335 males and 99 females or a total of 434. New admissions during the year were 123 against 81 and the total population of the hospital was 557 against 512 in the preceding year. To avoid over-congestion, admissions were strictly restricted to dangerous and long-standing cases only. Of the new admissions, the Nagpur district contributed the largest number. The daily average strength of the total popula- tion, excluding the observation cases, was 454.06 (353.83 males and 100.23 females) against 432.79 (334.74 males and 98.05 females) in the previous year. Including the observation cases, the daily average strength was 460.02 against 436.43 in the previous year. The ratio per cent of cases "cured" to daily average strength was 11.30 males, 7.98 females, total 10.57 against 10.16 males, 3.06 females, total 8.55 in the previous year. The ratio per cent of cases "cured" to new admis- sions was 22.33 males and 30.00 females, total 23.58 against 21.13 males and 10.00 females, total 19.75 in the previous year. 3. The maximum number resident in the hospital on any one night was 477 (373 males and 104 females) against 444 (345 males and 99 females) in the previous year. Thus there was overcrowding by 29 patients on the male side, and extension of the hospital is urgently needed. Discharges. 4. Sixty-seven patients were discharged against 52 in the previous year, 48 as cured against 37, 8 improved against 8, and 11 otherwise against 7 in the previous year. The "discharged otherwise" and "improved" cases were taken over by their relatives. Cases under observation. 5. Two cases remained under observation on the 1st January 1933. 85 cases were sent for observation (including 3 re-admissions) against 55 in the previous year. Of these
2 87, one case was discharged by the Court, 56 were certified as insane, 6 recovered during the period of observation, 14 were uncertified as they exhibited no symptoms of insanity, 5 not being dangerous were not certified and 5 remained at the close of the year. Sickness and mortality. 6. The mortality during the year was 25 against 26 last year, giving a percentage of 5.51 against 6.01 last year. The causes of death were pneumonia 1, other tubercular infec- tion 2, heart failure 1, acute mania 3, epilepsy 4, colitis 5, acute bacillary dysentery 4, entritis chronic 1, pyelo- nephritis 1, pyaemia 1, acute infective gangrene 1, secon- dary anaemia 1.

Under dementia præcox, the admissions were 17, paranoia 5, confusional insanity 4, errors of development 4, insanity due to cannabis indica 3 and one each under circular insanity, anergic stupor and secondary dementia. STATEMENT No. VII Aetiological factors and associated conditions. 11. The principal predisposing and exciting causes amongst the new admissions were4 Treatment of epilepsy. 12. This year again the treatment of epilepsy by colloidal preparation of palladium could not be given an extensive trial owing to financial stringency. STATEMENT Finance. 13. The total amount spent for the upkeep of the No. VIII hospital was in round figures Rs. 96,509 against Rs. 91,429 in the previous year. The increase is partly due to more expenditure on "salaries" which was Rs. 28,820 and partly on " diet, clothing and bedding of patients" which was Rs. 36,738 against Rs. 27,427 and Rs. 31,900, res- pectively, of last year.

Agents for the sale of Publications issued by the Central Provinces Government (NOTE.ANNUAL REPORT ON THE MENTAL HOSPITAL AT NAGPUR IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES AND BERAR FOR THE YEAR 1935 Administration. Dr. J. Roy, M.B., D.P.M. (Eng.), was in charge throughout the year, except for the period of his leave from the 22nd May to the 21st June 1935, when Mr. A. K. Sen Gupta, Assistant Surgeon, held charge. STATEMENT No. I Population 2. The number of resident patients, at the beginning of the year, was 361 males and 99 females or a total of 460. New admissions during the year were 118 (95) and the total population was 578 (560). The daily average strength of the total population, excluding observa- tion cases, was 373.50 males and 103.04 females, total 476.54 (469.42). Including observation cases, the daily average strength was 378.40 males and 103.69 females, total 482.09 (474.52). The ratio per cent of cases "cured" to daily average strength was 9.37 males, 14.56 females, total 10.49 (11.29). The ratio per cent of cases "cured" to new admis- sions was 16.13 males, 36.00 females, total 20.34 (22.11). Accommodation. 3. The maximum number of resident patients on any one night was 387 males and 105 females (380 males and 99 females). Thus, there was overcrowding by 43 patients on the male side though admissions were strictly restricted to dangerous and long-standing cases only. The extension of the hospital is urgently needed to house the increasing population. But in view of the present state of provincial finances it would be desirable to restrict the admissions to the dangerous cases only as a temporary measure till the return of better times. The slight fall in the percentage of "cured" cases is probably due to the fact of restricting admissions only to dangerous and long-standing, that is, more or less chronic cases, for want of sufficient accommodation. Discharges. 4. The number of patients discharged during the year was 69 (69); 50 were discharged as cured, 10 as improved and 9, otherwise. Improved and other cases were taken over by their relatives before they could have the full benefit of treatment.
2 Sickness and mortality. 5. The mortality during the year was 30 (31), giving a percentage of 6.30 (6.60). The causes of deaths were pneumonia 1, influenza 1, asthma spasmodic 1, acute 3 Hydrotherapy and special treatment. 6. Eleven cases of acute mania were treated by hydrotherapy with success. Sulfosin singly and combined with Solganal B. Oleosum were tried on 2 cases without any appreciable improvement. Organotherapeutic treatment for Dementia Praecox, Melancholia and Puerperal insanity was given to 13 cases. The result has been varied but hopeful, and I am of opinion that more intensive research and experiment are necessary in this connection. Dental treatment of patients. The appointment of a Dentist has removed a long felt want. STATEMENT No. II Cases under observation. 7. Four cases were under observation on the 1st January 1935. Seventy-three cases (including 5 re-admissions) were sent for observation. Of these, 44 were certified as insane, 6 recovered during the period of observa- tion, 6 were not certified as they were not dangerous, 15 exhibited no symptoms of insanity, 1 was discharged by the court and 5 remained at the close of the year. STATEMENT No. III Criminal insanes and insane criminals. 8. The number of criminal insanes and insane criminals at the beginning of the year was 111 males and 15 females, total 126. The number admitted during the year was 34, including one re- admission. Of these 160, 17 were discharged, 12 died and the number at the close of the year was 117 males, 14 females, total 131. STATEMENT No. IV 9. These need no special comments. Religion, sex and residence. STATEMENT No. V Age. STATEMENT No. VI Showing form of Mental disorder. STATEMENT No. VII Showing the probable cause of insanity. 10. Mental stress due probably to long-standing economic depression is still an ex- citing cause in a large number of patients. Cannabis indica has shown an increase as an exciting factor. A large number of cases are returned as "cause unascertained", the history being defective. 2
4 STATEMENT No. VIII Finance. 11. The total amount spent for the upkeep of the hospital was Rs. 1,20,325 (Rs. 1,05,655) in round figures Under the heads "Salaries", "Public Works Department charges" and "Contingencies" there was an increase in the expenditure. There was a corresponding increase of "receipts" viz., maintenance charges Rs. 12,852 (Rs. 11,956), value of stores (calculated according to present rates) received from manufacturing departments, including garden and farm, Rs. 15,346 (Rs. 14,497). The average cost of "diet and clothing' per patient per mensem was Rs. 7-1-0 (Rs. 6-10-0), and inclusive of treatment, care and control, was Rs. 149-9-0 per patient per annum.

-on- the am. let] ANNUAL REPORT ON THE MENTAL HOSPITAL, NAGPUR, IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES AND BERAR, FOR THE YEAR 1941 t. 1. Buildings.The scheme to modernise the existing buildings and extension of hospital, etc., which had been postponed by Government on account of financial stringency was sanctioned during 1941 and the first year plan of the same is being given effect to during the year under report. 2. Population (Statement No. I).The number of resident patients at the beginning of the year was 411 males and 108 females, totalling S19. New admissions during the year were 79 [93] males and_17 [21] females, total 96 [114|, and the total population was 61S [622]. The daily average strength of the total population, excluding observation cases was 416.57 males and 109.14 females, total 525.71 [510.90]. Including observation cases the daily average strength was 421.82 males and 111.51 females, total 533.33 [516.13], The ratio per cent of cases &quot;cured&quot; to daily average strength was 11.28 males and 7.33 females, total 10.46 [9.981. The ratio per cent of cases &quot;cured' to new admissions was 27.85 males and 41.17 females, total 30.21 [17.611an improvement which it is pleasant to record. 3. Accommodation.The maximum number of resident patients on 'any one night was 424 males and 110 females [411 males and 108 females]. The accommodation available is for 458 males and 142 for females, i.e., a total of 600. Thus there was no overcrowding. 4. Discharges.The number of patients discharged during the vear was 63 [65] as per details below : ost vir :iai ak (1) Cured (2) Improved (3) Not improved (4) Otherwise 5. Sickness and mortality.The patients was good. The daily average 55 2 2 '.'.'. 4 general health of the sick was 19.86 [20.12]. na I am also glad to record that there have been fewer deaths this year, viz., 25 [381 and consequently the death rate was only 4.75 [7.44]. Of the 25 deaths, six were due to pneumonia, two to pulmonary tuberculosis, two to other tubercular infection, two to epilepsy, four to bacillary dysentery, two to colitis, and one each to schizophrenia catatonia, acute gastro-enteritis, typhoid fever, paratyhoid fever, heatstroke, secondary anaemia and sudden heart failure. The period of their stay in hospital was as under Above 10 years ... 10 Below 10 years ... 11 Under 1 year ... 4* * Of these three were received in a bad state of health. ;s. st
The longest residence prior to death was 45 years and the shortest was four months. Prophylactic measures against plague, cholera, smallpox were taken as usual. Amongst the resident patients 112 were treated for ankylostoma and 16.66 per cent were found infected among new admissions. The death rate per cent for 1941 in Mental Hospitals in other provinces in India is shown below : Bombay .. 8.50 Madras .. .. 7.29 Punjab .. . 4.55 Assam .. 8.65 Ranchi European Mental Hospital .. 7-28 Ranchi Indian Mental Hospital . . 3*25 6. Hydrotherapy and special treatment.Twenty-five cases were treated by hydrotherapy with success. Nineteen cases were treated by histamine combined with insulin of which five were discharged as cured and the rest are still under treatment. Cardiazol treatment was given with success to few cases but had to be given up on account of the uncertainty of the availability of the drug. Its substitute corasol is being tried. Acetylcholine was used in one case with success. The use of this drug as well as of hypo-glycaemic treatment by insulin had unfortunately to be postponed for want of a properly equipped laboratory, the construction of which is receiving attention. Organotherapy is tried in suitable cases. Dental treatment of patients.Mr. D. M. Kuntay, L.M.P., L.D.Sc, was in charge throughout the year. The total number attended to, both old and new cases, was 2,817. Occupational therapy.Excepting the infirm and sick patients others were engaged in agriculture, gardening, road making, weaving and dairy. Amusements.Besides providing the suitable patients with out-door games, etc., one cinema show was given with the kind help of the Agricultural Department. This was much appreciated by the patients specially as the majority of them were agriculturists themselves. Besides, selected patients were entertained by taking them out for cinema shows in the town. 7. Cases under observation (Statement No. II).Seven cases were under observation on the 1st January 194.1. Sixtv cases including 6 re-admissions were admitted for observation. Of these 31 were certified as insane, 7 although certified were released under section 14 of the Lunacy Act, 12 were discharged as cured, 8 criminal cases were remanded to jail as they did not exhibit signs of insanity, 2 died and 7 remained at the close of the year. 8. Criminal insane and insane criminals (Statement No. III).The number of criminal insane and insane criminals at the beginning of the year was 124 males and 16 females total 140.
The number admitted during the year was 24 [241 males and 4 [1.1 females, total 28. Thirteen were discharged, six died and the number at the close of the year was 130 males and 19 females, total 149. 9. Religion, sex and residence (Statement No. IV), age (Statement No. V) and form of mental disorder (Statement No. VI).These need no special comment. 10. Probable cause of insanity (Statement No. VII).History being defective the probable cause of insanity could not be ascertained in a large number of cases. 11. Finance (Statement No. VIII).The total amount spent for the upkeep of the hospital was Rs. 1,36,240 inclusive of Public Works Department charges amounting to Rs. 2,764 in round figures. Exclusive of the Public Works Department charges the total amount spent is Rs. 1,33,476 LRs. 1,21,139J. The average cost for diet, clothing and bedding per patient per mensem was Rs. 8-2-8 [Rs. 7-3-11 j and inclusive of treatment, care and control the cost was Rs. 171-4-11 [Rs. 163-12-01 per patient per annum. The increase in maintenance cost is due mostly to higher prevailing rates of commodities and increased staff. 12. General.Before finally discharging patients as &quot;cured&quot; a number of them were permitted to work on parole in the gardens, etc., without any supervision, and selected few were permitted even to take a walk in the city. I am glad to note thut this system is working satisfactorily. 13. Visitors.Official and non-official visitors attended the monthly meetings regularly. 14. Administration.Mr. J. Roy, M.B., D.P.M (Eng.), was in charge throughout the year. Mr. A. K. Sen Gupta, M.B., B.S., has been Deputy Superintendent from 6th September 1941, vice Mr. G. D. Pimpalkar, M.B.,B.S., transferred.

ANNUAL REPORT ON THE MENTAL HOSPITAL, NAGPUR IN THE G. P. & BERAR, FOR THE YEAR 1946 Buildings. Some of the remaining items ot the scheme to modernise the existing buildings and the extension of hospital, etc., which was sanctioned in 1941, were given effect to, but the piogramme for the year under report was held in abeyance, as the question of transfer of the present Mental Hospital to a new site was under contemplation, which is now dropped. 2. On the recommendation of the Bhore Committee, now a fresh plan of modernisation is being contemplated. The actual extensive building programme may take a little longer time as other essenr.ial improvement] s will be given effect to, first. 3. Population (Statement No. I).The number of resident-patients ai the beginning of the year was 409 males and 124 females, totalling 533. New admissions during the year were 105 (102) males and 24 (32), females total 129 (134) and the total population was 662 (670). The daily average strength of the total population, excluding observation cases, was 406*83 males and 123*90 females, total 530*73. Im hiding observation cases the daily average strength was 423*14 males and 126*52 females, total 549*66. The ratiooer cent of cases 'Vured&quot; to daily average strength was 11*05 males and 11*29 females, total 11*11 (10*31). The ralio per cent of cases &quot;cured&quot; to new admissions was 21*94 males and 29*15 females, total 23*26 (25*44). 4. Accommodation.-The maximum number of resident-patients on any one night was 439 males and 131 females, total 570. The accommodation available is 458 for males and 142 for females, i.e., a total of 600. Tims there was no overcrowding. On comparison of the figures for the last five years (a statement enclosed), itwillbeseen that the number of admissions were highest during 1945 and lowest during 1943. The percentage of &quot;cured&quot; to newr admissions was highest in 1943 and lowest in 1944. 5. Discharges.The number of patients discharged during the year was 81 (89) as per details below : (1) Cured59. (2) Improved18. (3) Not improved2. (4) Otherwise2. Highest number of discharges was recorded in 1945 and lowest in 1944. 6. Sickness and Mortality.The general heahhofthe patients was good. The daily average sick was 27*58 (35*13). I am glad to record that there have been fewer deaths this year, -z*/^.,42(48), and consequently the death-rate was only 4*65 (5*22). Of the 42 deaths, 3 were due to Pneumonia, 2 to Epilepsy, 3 to Bacillary Dysentery, 5 to Coitus, 5 to General Debility, 6 to Secondary Anaemia, 2 to Heart Failure, 3 to Chronic Malaria, 2 to Cold Abscess, 3 to Ankylostomiasis, 4 to Gastroenteritis and 1 each to general Paralysis ot insane, Cellulitis Diabetes, Cnronic Rheumatoid Arthritis and 2 Septicaemia.
The period of stay in the Hospital was as under Between 30 to 40 years2. Between 20 to 30 yeais3. Between 10 to 20 years6. Between 1 to 10 years19. Under one year12*. *Of these 7 were received in a bad state of health. The longest residence prior to death was 34 years and the shortest was 4 days. {The latter patient was received in a very bad state of health.) Prophylactic measures against Plague, Cholera and Smallpox were taken as usual. Amongst the resident patients, 13 were treated tor Ankylostoma, 27 for Round-worms and 3 for Tape-worms. The death-rate per cent for 1946 in Mental Hospitals in other provinces in India was as shown below : Bombay 87, Madras 8*32. Punjab 7.25, Assam 5*15. United Provinces(1) Benares 395, (2) Agra 12 17and (3) Bareilly 6*12. European Mental Hospital, Ranchi 2*53. 7. Hydrotherapy and Special Treatments. (a) 25 cases were treated by hydrotherapy with success. (6) Histamine and Insulin.33 cases were treated by histamine combined with insulin ot which 12 were discharged as cured and the rest had shown very slight improvement. This treatment is, however, being discontinued and as soon as proper facilities and arrangements are made, modified insulin shock treatment will be started. (c) Cardiazal Shock Treatment.No Cardiazal Shocks were given this year as the Electric Convulsion Therapy was started in its place. (d) Electric Convulsion Therapy.25 cases were treated by Electric Convulsion Therapy, of which 17 were successful in varying degrees. This torm of treatment has been found to be most useful and more frequent use of it is being made. It is safer than the Cardiazal Shock Treatment. (e) Ammonium Chloride Shocks have also been given to cases who are not strong enough for either Electrical oi Cardiazal Convulsion Therapy. (/) Narcoanalysis has just been started. A liberal use of this form of therapy will soon be made in cases needing it. One is greatly handicapped as the staff is inadequate and Narcoanalysis is a time-absorbing procedure. (g) Dental Treatment of Patients.Dr. E. S. Bhusreddy, L.D.Sc, was in charge throughout the year. The total number attended to both old and new cases was 2,016. (h) Occupational Therapy.Excepting the infirm and sick patients, others were engaged in agriculture, gardening and dairy. During war time, weaving was stopped due to shortage ot yarn, etc. This department still remains closed. Caning hospital chairs has newly been started here during the month of December and quite a number of patients have learnt this occupation well. (i) Amusements.Suitable patients were provided with outdoor games. S~&gt; also selected patients were entertained by taking them out for Cinema shows in the town. Magic shows are also arranged from time to time.
3 8. Gases under observation (Statement No. II).10 cases were under observation on the 1st January 1946. 93 cases were admitted for observation. Of these, 53 were certified as insane, 26 did not exhibit signs of insanity, 2 died and 22 remained at the close of the year. 9. Criminal-insanes and insane criminals (Statement No. III). The number of criminal-insants and insane-criminals at the beginning of the year was 132 (133) males and 16(16) females, total 148 (149). The number admitted during the year was 14 (16) males and 4(1) females, total 18(17). Seven were discharged, 14 died and the number at the close of the year was 126 males and 19 females, total 145. 10. Religion, Sex and Residence (Statement No. IV), Age (Statement No. V) and Form of Mental Disorder (Statement No. VI).These need no special comment. 11. Probable cause of insanity (Statement No. VII).History being defective, the probable cause of insanity could not be ascertained in a large number of cases. 12. Finance (Statement No. VIII).The total amount spent for the upkeep of the hospital was Rs. 2,85,133 inclusive of Public Works Department charges amounting to Rs. 5,450 in round figures. Exclusive of Public Works Department charges, the total amount spent is Rs. 2,79,683 (2,62,840). The average cost for diet, clothing and bedding per patient per mensem was Rs. 16-11-0 and inclusive of treatment, care and control the cost was Rs. 345-3-8 per annum. The total expenditure on Mental Hospital, Nagpur, increased every year and it was highest during the year under report, due to increase in maintenance cost mostly due to higher prevailing rates of commodities and increased staff. 13. General.Before finally discharging patients as &quot;cured&quot; a number of them were permitted to work on parole in the gardens, etc., without any supervision. I am glad to note that this system is working satisfactorily and in future the system of granting paroles to patients will be more liberally used. 14. Visitors.Official and non-official visitors attended the monthly meetings regularly. 15. Administration.Dr. J. Roy, M.B., D.P.M. (Eng.), was in charge up to November 1946 and thereatter from 1st December 1946, Major K. C. Dube, M.B.,B.S., has assumed charge of the Superintendentship of this Hospital. Dr. A. K. Sen Gupta, M.B.,B.S., has been Deputy Superintendent throughout the year and so also during the last five years. Nagpur : The Uthjuly 1947. L. K.

ANNUAL REPORT ON THE MENTAL HOSPITAL, NAGPUR, IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES AND BERAR FOR THE YEAR 1947 1. Buildings.In the year under report a new scheme for the improvement in the post-war development plan was submitted to the Government. The Government are pleased to accord their administrative approval. The Public Health Engineer has been requested to submit stage II plan and estimate for proposed improvement of water-supply and drainage of this hospital. No major changes in the existing buildings are contemplated as yet. 1-A. Post-war Development.A comprehensive development scheme has just been approved, consisting of {a) Provision of adequate staff. {b) Provision of adequate equipment. (c) Improvement in the patients' diet. (d) Improvement in the patients' clothings. (e) Improvement to the dairy and vegetable gardens. (/) Provision of water-supply and drainage. 2. Population (statement No. 1).(a) The number of resident patients at the beginning of the year was 417 males and 124 females, totalling 541. New admissions during the year were 116 [105] males and 37 [24J females, total 153 [129] and the total population was 694 [662]. The daily average strength of the total population excluding observation cases was 413.45 males and 128.97 females, total 542.42. All these figures are the highest recorded so far Including observation cases the daily average strength was 420.35 males, and 130.83 females, total 551.18. The ratio per cent of cases &quot;cured&quot; to daily average strength was 15.96 males and 7.07 females, total 14.01 111.11]. The ratio per cent of cases &quot;cured&quot; to new admissions was 26.72 males and 13.51 females, total 23.53 [23.26]. (b) Eight (voluntary boarders) patients were admitted during the year under report. Of these, four were discharged as cured, one discharged unimproved, one died and two are still in the hospital. 3. Accommodation.The maximum number of resident patients on any night was 428 males and 136 females, total 564. The accommodation available is 458 for males and 142 for females, i.e., a total of 600. Thus there was no overcrowding. On comparison of figures for the last five years, i.e., from 1942 to 1946 (statement enclosed) it will be seen that the number of admissions were highest during 1945 and lowest during 1943. The percentage of &quot;cured&quot; to new admissions was highest in 1943 and lowest in 1944. In 1947 the number of admissions increased bv 19 over and above the maximum figure of 1945. 4. Discharges.The number of patients discharged during the year was 103 [81] as per details below : (1) Cured76. (2) Improved20. (3) Not improved3. (4) Otherwise4. The highest number of discharges was recorded in 1945 (89) and lowest in 1944 (51).
5. Sickness and Mortality.The. general health of the patients during the year under report was below par which led to decrease resistance of patients to infection resulting in larger number of deaths. The general deterioration in physical health of the patient? was due to cumulative effect, insufficient diet for over a long period. (This was due to ration control during the war-time when the rations were drastically reduced. The improvement of diet is being considered in the development plan.) The daily average number of sick treated in Mental Hospital was 31.98 as against 27.58 in the previous year. During the year under report the total deaths number 74 against 40 in 1946. The death percentage in new admissions was 8.50 [4.65]. This excludes the observation cases. for i tica in IS Causes of Death Chronic Osteomyelitis General Debility and Old Age Gastroenteritis Ankylostomiasis Heavy round-worm infection Pneumonia Acute Bacillary Dysentery Chronic Malaria Malignant tumour of Prostate Secondary Anaemia Septic Ulcer Pleurisy Left Side Heart Failure Asthmatic attack causing respiratory and circulatory failure.

The shortest was four days (this patient was received in a very poor physical condition). #Of these, 12 were received in very bad state of health.
Prophylactic measures were laken against cholera and smallpox as usual. Amongst the resident patients, 20 were treated for Ankylostoma, 33 for round-worms and 3 for Oxyuris Vermicularis, 8 for Entamaeba Hystoli-tica and 12 for Giardia Lamblia infection. The death-rate per cent for 1947 in Mental Hospitals in other provinces in India was as under : (1) N. M. Mental Hospital, Thana12.8. (2) Mental Hospital, Dharwar5.2. (3) Mental Hospital, Ratnagiri9.91. (4) Mental Hospital, Ahmedabad2.6. (5) Central Mental Hospital, Yerwada6.43. (6) Madras7.79. (7) European Mental Hospital, Ranchi2.88. (8) United Provinces Mental Hospital5.50. (9) Tezpur (Assam)5.53. 6. Hydrotherapy and Special Treatments.(a) Fifteen cases were treated with Hydrotherapy with good results. (b) One hundred and twenty-three cases were treated by Electric Convulsion Therapy, out of which 42 were cured and 33 improved and 48 cases remained unchanged. Most of the cases which remained unchanged had chronic mental trouble of over two years' duration. The cases which were cured and showed improvement were fresher cases of less than two years' onset. This type of treatment has been noted to be of immense value ^ in recent cases. A variety of cases were subjected to this treatment including one case of severe anxiety state (Psychoneurosis) which showed complete freedom from all symptoms with only a short treatment. It was also found to be very useful in acute maniacal persons who received frequent shocks, i.e., once or tw7ice daily. (c) Fourteen cases were given Ammonium Chloride Convulsion Therapy4 wrere completely recovered, 5 were improved and 5 did not show any change. The form of treatment is very mild and was given to those persons who were unable to stand the electrical convulsions. The drawback is that the course of treatment is very long and results uncertain. (d) Two cases were treated by continuous Narcosis with success. (e) Saline infusions have also been given to a number of acutely excited and maniacal patients with very encouraging results. (f) Glandular and Harmone therapy was also given to suitable patients. One case of Myxocdema with mental symptoms was completely recovered. (g) Pyro-therapy was also given with sulfosin in few cases. (h) Narcoanalysis was also given to a number of patients and frequent use of it is being made in diagnosis and treatment of suitable patients. (i) Other forms of treatment.Vitamin therapy (in deficiencies), Nutritional treatment, etc., were also given. (/) Dental treatment of patients.Dr. V. M. Pathak, L.D.Sc, was iz charge throughout the year. Total number of cases attended to (both old and new) was 735. (k) Occupational TherabwExcepting the infirm and sick patients, others were engaged in agriculture, gardening, dairy, cleaning utensils, cooking, carpentry, smithying, general sanitation, etc. New occupational, works started during the year were caning of chairs, painting and polishing of furniture and beds. In the female section knitting, needle-work and embroidery work was started under the guidance of Mrs. Dube (wife of the
Superintendent) during the year under report, and quite a _ number of patients took active interest and were mentally better. Various dainty laces, pillow cases, table cloths, woollen pillows, etc., were prepared. (/) Amusements and recreations.Newspaper editors have been pleased to contribute free of charge &quot;Maharashtra&quot;, Weekly, &quot;Independent&quot;, Weekly and Daily, &quot;Nagpur Times&quot;. These papers are entirely for the use of literate mental patients. Selected patients were taken out for cinema and circus shows in the town. One magic show was also arranged during the year. Badminton was played by a few patients. A football ground is being made by the patients in an open area of the compound. 7. Cases under Observation (statement No- II).Twenty-two [10] cases were under observation on the 1st January 1947. 118 [93] cases were detained for observation.

The number admitted during the year was 21 [14] males and 4 [4] females, total 25 [18]. 40 [7] were discharged, 16 [141 died and the number at the close of the ^ear was 95 males and 19 females, total 114. (The number of discharges is mainly due to remission of sentences on 15th August 1947.) 9. Religion, Sex and Residence (statement No. IV), Age (statement No. V) and Form of Mental Disorder (statement No. VI).These need no special comment. 10. Probable Cause of Insanitv (statement No. VII).Due to deficient history, the probable cause of insanity could not be ascertained in a large number of cases. 11. Finance (statement No. VI3T). -The total amount spent for the upkeep of the hospital was Rs. 3,23.544 inclusive of Public Works Department charges amounting to Rs. 8,691 in round figures. Exclusive of Public Works Denartment charges, the total amount spent was Rs. 3,14,853 [Rs. 2,79,683].

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MENTAL HOSPITAL, NAGPUR, FOR THE YEAR 1951 1. Building.No new buildings were constructed during the year under report. The annual repairs only were carried out to the building. 2. Population(Statement No. I).(a) The number of resident patients at the beginning of the year was 360 males and 128 females, totalling 488. The new admissions during the year were 135 (108) males and 62 (53) females, totalling 197 (161) and thus the total population was 685 (722). The daily average strength of the total population excluding observation cases was 35.7.98 males and 139.03 females, totalling 497.01. Including the observation cases the daily average strength was 364.08 males and 143.91 females, totalling 507.99 (543.60). The ratio percentatge of cases &quot;cured&quot; to daily average strength was 16.76 (13.60) males and 13.66 (10.11) females, total 15.89 (12.70). The ratio percentage of cases &quot;cured&quot; to admission was 25.18 (17.51) males and 12.90 (n.30) females, total 21.37 (T5-5&deg;)- (b) Twenty-two patients were admitted as Voluntary boarders during the year under report. Of these five were discharged as cured, seven discharged as unimproved, seven discharged as improved and three are still in the hospital. 3. Accommodation.The maximum number of resident patients on any one night was 381 males and 156 females, total 537. The accommodation available is 458 for males and 142 for females, i.e., a total of 600 beds. Thus there was overcrowding in the female section only. Maximum number of male and female paying patients on any one night was 43 and 25 respectively. The accommodation available for paying patient is 24 males and 8 females. Thus there was overcrowding and shortage of paying ward accommodation in both the sections. On comparing the figures of admission during the past five years, i.e., from 1946 to 1950, and the year under report (statement enclosed), it will be seen that the number of admissions was highest during the year under report and the lowest during the year 1946. The percentage of &quot;cured&quot; to new admission was highest in 1948 and lowest in 1949. 4. Discharges.The number of patients discharged during the year was 136 as against 172 during the last year as detailed below : (1) Male Female Total (2) (3) (4) 60 (54) 19 (14) 79 (68) 18 (30) 10 (12) 28 (42). 20 (32) 8 (17) 28 (49) 1 (9) 0 (4) ' 1 (13) 99 (125) 37 (47) 136 (172) 1. Cured 2. Improved 3. Not Improved 4. Otherwise Total When compared with figures of last year though the total number of discharges is less, the number of those who were discharged as cured is more. Another cause of less discharges is that the less number of unimproved or otherwise cases were discharged.
The third reason for more discharges in the previous year was that a number of cases were released by the relatives in 1950 on account of the faith in the treatment of &quot;Angul Baba&quot; who set up as an evangelist in Orissa. The fourth reason of more discharges in 1950 was encouragement to relatives by the then Superintendent to get the patients discharged as that year was under great financial stress and economy drive was on. 5. Sicknesss and Mortality.The general health of the patients was good. Number of deaths during the year were 18 as against 62 of last year. It is worth commenting that deaths in 1951 have been the lowest so far observed in any year in this hospital. This marked reduction in mortality is due to improvement in general cleanliness and strict supervision on diet and water-supply. More attention was paid to prompt diagnosis and treatment and modern drugs like Antibiotics were used in large quantities. Prophylactic measures against infectious diseases were taken when necessary. There was no epidemic of any kind. The daily average of sick treated in the hospital was 23.75 as against 34.23 in the previous year. This again indicates better general health and less diseases among the patients. The death percentage in new admissions which were 6, was 3.55 (0.60). The reason for higher percentage was due to already existing poor state of health of new admissions. The details of the cause of deajh and their ages are as below. There were no deaths in observation cases:- Causes of death in new admissions only ------ Age (1) (2) Years 1. Pneumonia .. 48 2. Cirrhosis liver .. 57 3. Diarrhcea .. 70 4. G. P.

6. Special Treatment.The following special treatments were given to the patients during the year under report : (a) Hydrotherapy.17 cases were treated with Hydrotherapy. Out of these six cases were cured, three improved and eight cases remained unchanged. This form of therapy was used very sparingly as the equipment for giving it is of old type which may lead to accidents. (b) Insulin Therapy.This .form of treatment in its proper form is not given in this hospital due to acute shortage of medical and other staff. A modified histamine insulin therapy was -given to 9 cases. Out of these, 4 cases were cured, 3 improved and 2 cases showed no change. (c) Electric convulsive therapy.Fifty-seven cases were treated with this therapy. Out of these 20 cases were cured, 12 improved and 25 cases showed no change. An extra E. C. T. machine was ordered from England to meet our requirements. Intensive E. C. T. was also used in some chronically excited patients and showed good results. (d) Ammonium Chloride Convulsive therapy.Eight cases were given this treatment. Out of these, 3 cases were improved and 5 cases showed no change. (e) Corosal Convulsive therapy.Thirteen cases were treated with this therapy. Out of these, seven cases were cured, one improved and five cases showed no change. (/) Continuous Narcosis.One case was improved hy this treatment. (g) Anti-syphilitic treatment.Thirteen cases were treated by this treatment. Out of these, one case was cured, seven improved and five showed no change. (h) Thyroil treatment for catatonics.Seven cases were treated by this treatment. Out of these, one case was cured and six cases showed no change. Many patients of Epilepsy were treated with Epanutrn. (i) Intravenous Hypertonic.Glucose saline solution was used in most of the acutely excited, toxic and dehydrated cases. (k) A breaction.With the Pentothol with and without methedrine was also used in many cases. Abreaction with CO 2 could not be started due to lack of equipment but in the next year this form of treatment will also be available. (/) Narcounalysis.Drug analysis suggestion with pentothal sodium was used in suitable cases. (m) Psychotherapy.Long-term Psychotherapy lasting over 8 months in one case showed remarkable result. (n) Leucotomy.Arrangement could not be completed but it is hoped that in the next year this facility will also be provided. Certain patients were sent to Mayo Hospital and Medical College for C. S. F. and B. M. R. tests. This has helped much in investigations of these cases.
fen to Out : cases ;nt for Dental treatment of patients.-Dr. L. H. Bhusreddy and Dr. R. M. Rai, L.D.Sc Dental Surgeons were in charge of this treatment during the year 1951. The total number of cases attended to (both old and new) was 936. Occupational Therapy.Those patients who were physically well were engaged in agriculture, gardening, dairy, tailoring, sewing and helping in duties such as cooking, etc. Pottery work was also started during the year under report and few patients were engaged in this work. The weaving and newar making which was stopped due to lack of yarn was restarted and the department was reorganised. Coir, door-mat making was also started. Making mattresses after teasing coir and cotton was also done in the hospital. Amusements and Recreation.Indoor and outdoor games such as carrom, volleyball, football, etc., were played by some patients. A new football field was prepared by the patients. Books, news-papers, magazines, etc. were supplied to those patients who were in a position to read. A public appeal for free supply of books and magazines was made through the Publicity Department. Response to this was given by some papers. ^ Reading room has not yet been started due to lack of proper accommodation but make shift arrangements are being made. Some furniture from patients comforts fund has been acquired for this purpose. . Professional jugglers were hired during the year to show their magic shows, tricks, etc., to the hospital patients. Ninety-five patients were sent to public cinema houses and circus under escort. This was hardly ever done before. On a request from this hospital cinema shows of educational and entertaining films were also arranged by Director of Information and Publicity, Madhya Pradesh, Nagpur from time to time. , . Music.Music section for the hospital is organised and patients take a keen and regular interest in playing on Harmonium and Tabla, etc. A chronic Schizophenic was sent for Radio trial. He has shown a marvellous improvement in adjustment within the hospital after this form of treatment. His programme on Radio could not take place on account of certain formalities in observance of rules which could not be completed in a mental patient. 7. Cases under observation (Statement No. II).Five cases were actually under observation on the 1st January 1951 and 121 (115) cases were received for observation during the year. Out of these 93 (102) were certified as insane, 17 (12) did not show any signs of insanity and hence they were recommended for discharge from the court, 3 cases were certified but were discharged under section 14 of Act of 1912 and 13 (5) remained under observation at the end of the year. 8. Criminal insanes and insane criminals (Statement No. III).The number of criminal insane and insane criminals at the beginning of the year was 86 (94) males, 15(16) females, total 101 (no). The number of criminal patients admitted during the year was 12 (13) males and 2 (1) female, total 14 (14). Out of the total population of criminal insane and insane criminal patients 8 (15) were discharged, 3 (8) died and their number remaining at the year was 89 males, 15 females, total 104. rm is al and given d and 1 with proved achine Inten-atients given nd 5 with s im- ent. this )roved d by cases reated most edrine could t year Ddium lonths it is vided. ;e for these
?6 9. Religions, sex, and residence (statement No. IV), Age, (statement No. V) and Form of mental disorder (Statement No. VI).These need no special comments. 10. Probable cause of insanity (Statement No. VII).In few cases the probable cause of insanity could not be ascertained due to non-receipt of proper documents from Magistrate and histories from the relatives of the patients. 11. Finance (Statement No. VIII).The total amount spent for the upkeep of the hospital was Rs. 3,88,842 inclusive of Public Works Department charges amounting to Rs. 5,594 in round figures. Exclusive of Public Works Department charges, the total amount spent was Rs. 3,83,248 (Rs. 3,49,021). The average cost for diet, clothing and bedding per patient per month was Rs. 21-7-7 and inclusive of treatment care and control, the cost was Rs. 511-12-0 per annum. Due to economic measures the expenditure on the hospital was kept down and was not much increased from the last year's expenditure. .&raquo; 12. General.Before finally discharging patients as &quot;cured&quot; a number of patients were permitted to work on parole, i.e., without any supervision. This system is working satisfactorily. A large number of patients are kept unlocked within the hospital premises. On each patient clinical conference is held on three days in a week where the case is thoroughly discussed in details. Improvement in the system of recording case notes has been done. This year the grass farm produced a good crop due to Municipal regulations imposing heavier penalties on stray cattle. Equipments for fencing over long farms have been acquired while a complete fencing of the Hvhole area will take a few years. 13. Visitors.Official and non-official visitors attended the monthly meetings. 14. Administration.Dr. K. C. Dube, M.B.,B.S. (Bombay), D.P.M. (London), was in-charge throughout the year. Dr. G. S. Vingle, M.B.,B.S., has been Deputy Superintendent throughout the year. 15. Acknowledgments.We express our thanks to I. The editors of : (1) &quot;Lokwani&quot; Bhandara.
