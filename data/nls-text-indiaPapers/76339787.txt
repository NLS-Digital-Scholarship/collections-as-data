Other trainings.4 the Government call the attention of the Chief Presidency Magistrate to the matter, as presumably all owners prosecuted are in possession of animals- requiring treatment or at least rest, care and attention. 23. The fees realised for treatment, etc., were Rs. 34059-15-6 and the cost of feeding was Rs. 26, 845-2-9 against Rs. 24,549-15 and Rs. 41,027-12-9 of last year. The cost of feeding included the feeding of all poor patients, as also of the riding ponies, ambulance horses and breeding and draft cattle belonging to the College. It is worthy of note that in 30 years of the existence of this College, this is the first occasion on which the hospital fees have exceeded the cost of feeding. 21. Fodder crops.5 Captain R. T. Davis was again of invaluable help to me both in the office and in the Lecture Room. Mr. S. S.

All requisitions for sera, etc., from Calcutta and mufassal were promptly met. During the year, 3,22,400 (loses of anti-Rinderpest serum, 10,046 doses of anti-Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia serum, 3602/3 doses of anti-Anthrax serum and 7 doses of Mallein were supplied. 6. Slides showing various infective diseases of animals and specimens and charts of well-bred cattle were sent out to districts for exhibition and demonstration with the aid of a magic latern to the raiyats at fairs and shows. 7. At my direction, the Laboratory Assistant Babu Hari Charan Ganguli, G.B.V.C, prepared during the year the following notes :TABLE I Showing the main results and receipts and expenditure of the Bengal Veterinary College during the year 1923-24.

TABLE OF CONTENTS. Preface and General Administration. PAGE. Officer-in-charge, duration of tour, etc. ... ....... 1-2 Part I.ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BENGAL, For the year 1923-24. Preface and General Administration. Mr. P. J. Kerr, I. V. S., worked as Director and Veterinary Adviser to Government from the beginning of the year till the 23rd February last, when he went on leave for 8 months. On the same date (afternoon) I assumed charge of the office of Director and continued to work as such till the remainder of the year. Mr. Kerr's duties as Veterinary Adviser were taken over by Mr. A. D. MacGregor, I. V. S., who carried them on in addition to his work as Principal, Bengal Veterinary College, till the close of the year. 2. Owing to continued ill-health it was not possible for Mr. Kerr to go out on frequent tours to the districts. He was therefore out in camp for only 33 days during the year, and travelled 4,810 miles by rail, 40 miles by road and 381 miles by steamer. He visited the districts of Howrah, Burdwan, Khulna, Barisal, Tippera and Darjeeling and inspected the veterinary work and advised local bodies regarding the improvement and expansion of veterinary aid in the mufassal. At Howrah he impressed upon the local authorities the necessity of retaining the only Veterinary Assistant Surgeon for the district. His representation bore fruit and the District Board ultimately withdrew their retrenchment proposal. At Burdwan he saw the Collector and the Chairman, District Board, on the subject of establishment of a well-equipped hospital to be run jointly by the Board and the Munici- pality, and steps have already been taken to secure a piece of suitable land for the purpose. He also worked hard in connection with the scheme for the opening of a hospital at the headquarters station of the Darjeeling District in collaboration with the S. P. C. A. there. In January last he visited Bombay and appeared as a witness before the Royal Commission on the Superior Civil Services in India, on behalf of himself and the Indian Veterinary Service Association. 3. During the five weeks that I remained in charge I stayed at headquarters and attended office to make myself acquainted with the needs of Veterinary Administration of this Province. 4. Assistant Director Babu Sarat Chandra Paul was in charge of the Western Range, comprising the Presidency; Burdwan and Rajshahi Divisions, from the beginning of the year till the 18th July last, when he was appointed to act as a Lecturer in the Bengal Veterinary College, a vacancy having arisen owing to the grant of leave to Rai Sahib Dibakar De of the Bengal Veterinary Service. Further changes were in turn necessary owing to this vacancy and Assistant Director Babu Nripendra Nath Majumdar was transferred from the Eastern
2 to the Western Range, while the vacancy in his place was filled by the temporary promotion of Veterinary Inspector Moulvi M. S. Chaudhuri to the Provincial Service. These arrangements continued to be in force till the 15th March last, when Rai Sahib Dibakar De returned to duty from leave. 5. During the period of 4 months that Babu Sarat Chandra Paul remained in charge of the Western Range, although he was far from well, he was on tour for 11 days and travelled 477 miles by rail, 58 miles by road and 15 miles by steamer. He inspected the work of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons at Rajshahi, Natore, Puthia, Baraset, Ranaghat, Serampore and Sheoraphuli and assisted Mr. Kerr in various matters connected with the administration. 6. The Eastern Range, comprising the two divisions of Dacca and Chittagong, was in charge of Assistant Director Babu Nripendra Nath Majumdar from the 1st April to the 4th June 1923, when he went on leave for one month and a half. Veterinary Inspector Babu K. C. Sen of Dacca was placed in charge of his office in addition to his own duties. Babu Nripendra Nath Majumdar made no tours while in charge of the Eastern Range. At the conclusion of his leave Babu N. N. Majumdar joined at Calcutta and worked as Assistant Director, Western Range, till the 15th March last. During this period he was on tour for 42 days and travelled 4,542 miles by rail, 76 miles by road and 165 miles by steamer. He visited Siliguri, Jalpaiguri, Bogra, Dinajpur, Malda,. Ranaghat, Krishnagar, Berhampur, Bankura, Chinsura, Nilphamari, Natore, Sirajganj and Mohimaganj, and inspected the work of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons. He also visited the Farm at Rangpur in connec- tion with cattle disease and selected a site for the dispensary at Mohima- ganj in that district. At Bankura he pursuaded the District Board to have a whole-time man for the dispensary and hospital there. In addition to this routine work of inspection Babu Nripendra Nath Majumdar worked in this office regularly and suggested various measures for the development of the work of this department. 7. During the period of 7 months in which he acted as Assistant Director, Eastern Range, Moulvi M. S. Chaudhuri inspected the veterinary work at Dacca, Narainganj, Munshiganj, Manikganj, Mymen- singh, Netrakona, Kishoreganj, Jamalpur, Sarishabari, Tangail, Comilla, Chandpur, Brahmanberia, Noakhali, Feni, Hatiya, Chittagong, Cox's Bazar, Satkania, Faridpur, Madaripur, Gopalganj, Barisal and Pirojpur, and travelled 2,332 miles by rail, 73 miles by road and 1,648 miles by boat and steamer. He also attended the meetings of the Mymensingh and Tippera District Boards in connection with the pro- posed veterinary hospital at Tangail and the placing of an additional Veterinary Assistant Surgeon for Brahmanberia and further acted as a judge for the selection of live stock, etc., for awarding prizes and medals, etc., in the Agricultural and Industrial Exhibition held at Manikganj under the presidency of the Director of Agriculture, Bengal. He was on tour for altogether 82 days during the year. 8. There are at present 2 Veterinary Assistant Surgeons, who are on deputation to foreign service. One is Mr. N. P. Fernandez, who is employed in Mesopotamia, while the other Babu N. N. Banerjee is on deputation to the Sikkim Durbar.
3 Part I.4 19. Rinderpest.5 28. Besides the above figures 1,118 animals were inoculated by the college staff in Calcutta and its suburbs. 29. The death rate amongst the inoculated was practically nil, being 0.6 for the whole Province. 30. A sum of Rs. 64,975 was paid to the Imperial Bacteriologist on account of the cost of serum supplied to this Province during the year. Table IV. 31. Table IV shows the work of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons in the mufassal during the year. 32. There were 63 Itinerant Veterinary Assistant Surgeons working in the Province and 27 Stationary Veterinary Assistant Surgeons, who also toured in the interior when required to do so. 33. These men visited 14,571 villages and treated 75,657 cases as against 14,438 villages and 81,986 patients, respectively, in the previous year. The decrease in the number of cases treated is attributed to the fact that in seats of outbreaks Veterinary Assistant Surgeons had to spend a considerable portion of their time in doing inoculation work referred to in paragraph 27 of this report. Some of them also visited the cattle pounds in their jurisdiction and submitted reports to the District Boards regarding hygienic condition and supply of food and water to the animals impounded. Table V.6 39. The want of a suitable hospital at the headquarters station of the Faridpur District is reported to be keenly felt. 40. A sum of Rs. 280 has been sanctioned by the Municipality of Chittagong for the construction of an observation ward for suspected rabid dogs in the Chittagong hospital. 41. The Comilla District Board have rebuilt the operation shed, in-patient shed and bull-shed in a systematic manner within the hospital compound. This arrangement will undoubtedly increase the number of patients during the current year, and greatly assist the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in the efficient carrying out of his duties besides greatly adding to the reputation of the District Board. 42. The question of the acquisition of land for the veterinary dis- pensaries at Chandpur in Tippera and Satkhania in Chittagong is still under consideration of the Boards. The fact that acquisition of land is under consideration is appreciated, and the appreciation would be much greater, if the Boards would decide quickly that the necessity for dispensaries was indisputable. 43. The acquisition of land for the Hatiya Veterinary Dispensary is in progress. It has been notified in the gazette and it is expected that the necessary land will be acquired soon. 44. A piece of land, measuring about 11-2 bighas, has been pro- vided by the Noakhali District Board for cultivation of Guinea Grass. Other District Boards would do well to follow the example, as the improvement of the cattle in all districts is largely dependent on better feeding. 45. With regard to the proposed veterinary hospital at Tangail, the matter now rests with the Board of Revenue for the allocation of funds for the construction of buildings from the Santosh Six Annas Wards Estate. A suitable site has already been selected by the Col- lector for the purpose. 46. The Veterinary Dispensary at Brahmanberia has been shifted to the Agricultural Seed Store, and the Operation Theatre is under reconstruction. 47. The land acquisition for the veterinary dispensaries at Kurigram and Mahimaganj is in progress. 48. One operation shed, one pucca well and a compound fencing- with gate have been constructed by the District Board of Rangpur at Nilphamary dispensary. The public have also promised to contri- bute towards the cost of construction of an in-door hospital there. The fact that a District Board has been able to interest the public- in veterinary work to this extent, should be carefully noted by other District Boards, as it proves that, the usual plea of paucity of funds, for this vitally important class of work, can be made negative by proper representation. 49. Although land was acquired some 4 years ago for the con- struction of a veterinary dispensary with quarters for the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon at Naogaon, nothing has yet been done by the Dis- trict Board of Rajshahi for the construction of the buildings.
7 50. The Pabna District Board have not yet taken any steps to construct a proper veterinary hospital at the headquarters station of the district, although land was acquired for the purpose some 10 years ago. 51. The District Board of Dinajpur have not yet been able to- construct buildings for the veterinary dispensary at Balurghat, although a piece of land was acquired by them some 4 or 5 years- ago. 52. The District Board of Murshidabad approached the Berham- pur Municipal authorities to join hands with them in erecting a suitable dispensary for the town, but it is reported no decision has yet been arrived at. 53. The District Board of Midnapur are in correspondence with Babu Hari Prosad Das, a public-spirited gentleman of village Muradpur in Tamluk Subdivision of that district, for the establish- ment of a veterinary dispensary in his village. It is understood that the aforesaid gentleman has promised to offer Rs. 3,000 and 3 or 4 bighas of land for the purpose8 Great interest is shown by the people in these lectures and it is hoped that the Department will shortly be able to greatly increase the scope of both lectures and lantern demonstrations. Knowledge relating to cattle breeding, feeding, etc., is in an exceedingly backward state and is not confined to the agriculture classes. Bull Breeding and Rearing Farms. 59. Table IX shows the working of the Farms in the Province. 60. There are two such Farms, one at Kalimpong, and another at Rangpur. The former is managed by St. Andrews' Colonial Homes, and the latter by the Agricultural Department. 61. Kalimpong.9 70. Out of thirteen students, who came out successful at the final examination of the Bengal Veterinary College in 1923, only four could be provided with posts under Government. Two more Veterinary Graduates have also been provided for10 75. Veterinary Inspectors.TABLE II Showing number of deaths from contagious diseases amongst animals during the year 1923-24. Province.

DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE AND INDUSTRIES. Veterinary Branch. CALCUTTA, THE 10TH NOVEMBER 1924. RESOLUTION2 slowly bearing fruit and that the confidence of the raiyats in their work is on the increase. The number of deaths among inoculated cattle was 1,162 or 6 per cent. of the total. Leaflets were freely distributed as in previous years, and lectures were also delivered by the staff among the raiyats with regard to the care, manage- ment and treatment of cattle. His Excellency the Governor notes with satisfaction that the practice of talking to boys in primary schools in Eastern Bengal by veterinary officers on animal husbandry, etc., has been greatly appreciated by the villagers and trusts that the efforts of the department to introduce this system throughout this province will meet with success. 4. The veterinary assistants visited 14,571 villages and treated 75,657 cases during the year under report, the corresponding figures for the two previous years being 14,438 villages and 81,986 patients and 12,084 villages and 67,511 animals, respectively. 5. All the stables and cattle byres in the Calcutta glanders area were regularly inspected by the glanders staff. Altogether 49 horses were seized and kept under observation, of which fifteen were destroyed from glanders after Mallein test, seven died of glanders, and the remaining 27 were discharged as free from that disease. 6. In spite of the observations made in the Government resolutions on the preceding years' reports there was little progress in the establish- ment of new dispensaries, and the number now stands at 41 only, the same as in the previous year. The number of patients treated at these dispensaries during the year was 44,952 as against 53,692 in the previous year. The decrease is reported to be principally due to the exclusion of the Sodepur Pinjrapole Hospital from the list of veterinary hospitals and dispensaries as there was no veterinary assistant surgeon employed in it during the year. 7. The number of stud bulls maintained in the province during the year under report was 176 against 159, 156 and 132 in the three preceding years. The breed of cattle in Bengal is notoriously poor. As pointed out by the Director, the lack of good breeding bulls constitutes a serious drawback to the improvement of cattle In the Rangpur Cattle Farm an improved breed of cattle, both for draught and milking purposes, has been evolved. The bulla supplied from the farm are distinctly superior to local build, whilst they have an advantage over imported stock on account of their local origin. His Excellency the Governor trusts that the Veteri- nary Department will co-operate with the Agricultural Department in popularizing the use of the bulls of the Rangpur Cattle Farm for breeding purposes and thereby assisting in the improvement of the local breed of cattle. He also desires to impress upon the local bodies the importance of the improvement of cattle by the larger provision of good stud bulls and trusts that they will take early stops to increase the number of these bulls. 8. The Director of the Civil Veterinary Department has again drawn the particular attention of the local bodies to the pressing need for a larger provision of funds and staff for the prevention of cattle diseases. The value of the work of the department in relation to the live-stock in Bengal on which the agricultural prosperity of the province chiefly depends cannot be overestimated. The serious economic loss which would have followed but for the services of the officers of the department can be easily realised from the fact that out of over 2 lakhs of bovines inoculated during outbreaks in the course of the year about 1,000 only died, whilst
3 the total number of deaths of bovines from contagious diseases was 27,000. In order to increase the usefulness of the department and effectively to check the mortality of cattle from preventible diseases His Excellency the Governor relies upon the assistance of the local bodies, who, he trusts, will co-operate with the Government by providing for larger expenditure on dispensaries, preventive inoculation and provision of the necessary staff of veterinary assistant surgeons. 9. The Director has drawn attention to the evil of cattle poisoning by arsenic practised by a class of people which has become a source of con- sidearble loss to the raiyats. He considers that it is now time to restrict the possession of the poison. Section 4 of the Poisons Act, 1919 (XII of 1919), empowers the Local Government to regulate by rule the possession of arsenic in any local area in which its use for the purpose of poisoning cattle appears to be of frequent occurrence. The Director should institute special enquiries into the matter and submit a report to Government in due course. 10. His Excellency the Governor has much pleasure in acknowledging the valuable services of Mr. P. J. Kerr as Director, Civil Veterinary Department, and Veterinary Adviser to Government, and in recording his appreciation of the good work done by Messrs. A. D. MacGregor and R. T. Davis in connection with the Civil Veterinary Department and the Bengal Veterinary College. The names of other officers commended by the Director and the Principal have also been noted.

The Epizootic Diseases of Animals Department in Calcutta. All stables in the Calcutta Glanders area extending from Barrackpore to Matiabruj and the town of Howrah were regularly inspected by the Inspectors. 2. Altogether 120 horses were seized under the Glanders and Farcy Act against 135 of last year. Of these, 12 were destroyed for Glanders, 10 died of Glanders, 37 destroyed for Surra and 25 died of Surra and 36 were discharged as free from any of the scheduled diseases under the Act. There was an outbreak of Surra in Epizootic form in the southern quarters of Calcutta, Manicktolla and Cossipore. Prompt action was taken to stamp out the disease. 3. Rupees 220 were given as compensation for 11 horses destroyed. 4. As in previous years, Rinderpest was very prevalent in Calcutta and its suburbs and in the town of Howrah, specially among the con- servancy cattle of the several Municipal Gowkhanas of the Calcutta Corporation, the Howrah and Titagarh municipalities and amongst cattle of Sodepore Pinjrapole. Prompt action was taken to check this disease. The cattle of the Howrah Municipal Gowkhanas and those in the Sodepur Pinjrapole were inoculated by their own qualified veterin- ary men, and we supplied serum to them. During the year under report, 1,334 cattle were inoculated against Rinderpest by the Glanders staff as against 836 of last year. The sale-proceeds of serum locally in addition to inoculation fees amounted to Rs. 4,808-7-0 as against Rs. 6,165-13-8 realised last year. 5. During the period of closure of the Presidency Remount Depot, 1,666 horses and 8 cows were examined by the Inspectors of this Depart- ment prior to their landing at the port of Calcutta. No clinical symptoms of any of the scheduled diseases were found. A. D. MACGREGOR, i.v.s., Principal, Bengal Veterinary College. BELGACHIA, CALCUTTA, The 1st June, 1926.

Babu Nripendra Nath Majumdar held charge of the office of Assistant Director, Eastern Range, Dacca, throughout the year, except for 17 days in continuation of the Durga Puja holidays, when he went on leave and Veterinary Inspector Babu K. C. Sen remained in charge of the office in addition to his own duties. Babu N. N. Majumdar toured for 76 days and travelled 1,539 miles by rail, 1,281 miles by steamer and 426 miles by road. During his tours he visited Barisal, Chittagong and Sarishabari twice each, and Perojpur, Noakhali, Mymensingh, Jamalpur, Faridpur, Cos's Bazar, Narainganj and Netrakona once each. In all the places he visited he saw the Chairmen of the District Boards, wherever possible, and impressed on them the necessity of increasing their Veterinary staff and their breeding establishment as a means towards preserving and improv- ing the local breed of cattle. In addition to this work he attended in June a severe outbreak of Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia in the interior of the district of Bakarganj and spent about a fortnight in conducting and supervising inoculation campaign. He was in charge of the serum simultaneous inoculation of the farm cattle at Manipur in November and January last. He accompanied me to the Agricultural and Industrial Exhibition at Faridpur, and delivered lectures in Bengali regarding the improvement of the breed of cattle. At the request of the exhibition authorities he also read a paper on Co-operation in Agriculture (Dairy, Poultry, etc., by Rai Dr. Chuni Lal Bose Bahadur. 6. Veterinary Assistant Surgeons N. N. Banerji and N. P. Fernandez remained on deputation to foreign service during the year under-report. Veterinary Assistant Surgeon S. L. Sen was allowed further leave with- out pay for one year to continue in the post of Veterinary Inspector, Penang. Part I6 Compensation amounting to Rs. 155 was awarded in four cases of compulsory destruction made under the provisions of the Act. 10. Anthrax.1 22. Nine hundred and sixty-six outbreaks in which inoculation was undertaken were attended during the year under review and the total number of animals inoculated was 173,762 as per details below as against 136,448 animals protected in 826 outbreaks in the year previous :Surgeons for treatment. This indicates, as pointed out in the last year's report, a growing demand for the establishment of regular dispensaries for rendering veterinary aid to the raiyats, and it is hoped local bodies will realize their responsibility in this direction and work up to the sanctioned programme of a dispensary in each district and sub- divisional headquarters with a Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge. Table V. 30. Table V shows the working of the hospitals and dispensaries in the province. 31. Two new dispensaries, one at Sarisabari and another at Cox's Bazar, were opened during the year thus bringing the total number of such institutions to 43. 32. The total number of cases treated during the year both as in and outpatients were 51,025 and 11,988 cases were supplied with medicines as against 47,260 and 7,536 cases, respectively, in the previous year. 33. The District Board of Midnapore constructed a dispensary with quarters for the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon at Khargpur, near Tangra Bazar, during the year. 34. An indoor patient shed was added to the Nilphamari Veterinary dispensary in October last, at the cost of Moulvi Matiar Rahman Chowdhuri of Sonarai in that district. The thanks of the department are due to him for his liberality and public spirit. 35. The Tahsildar's bungalow at Alipur Duars was transferred by Government to the Veterinary Department for the dispensary and quarters of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon there. It is expected that the bungalow will be made over to this Department as soon as the new quarters of the Tahsildar are ready. 3G. Provision has also been made for the construction of a permanent dispensary and quarters for the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon at Matha- bhanga in Cooch Behar. It is expected that the same will be finished during the current year. 37. A double-storied building has already been hired by the District Board of Rangpur for the dispensary and quarters of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon at Saidpur, sanction for the creation of which appoint- ment was asked for at the close of the year. 38. Pending the construction of permanent veterinary dispensaries at Kurigram and Mahimaganj, the District Board of Rangpur have made contract with some private gentlemen for 10 years on hire to build the dispensaries and quarters in those places. The work has already been commenced at Kurigram. At Dimla, the District Board have however decided to construct their own buildings. 39. The District Board of Darjeeling have also approved of the appointment of a Stationary Veterinary Assistant Surgeon for Darjeeling, and proposals for opening the post were submitted to Government on the 3rd March last. 40. The Local Board of Kalimpong have contributed a sum of Rs. 200 to the D. H. S. P. C. A., for the improvement of the infirmary there. An approach road from the main Pedong road to the infirmary
6 has also been constructed. It is desirable that the Board's Veterinary dispensary with Assistant's quarters should be located in the infirmary, as has been done at Kurseong. 41. A godown shed has also been added to the Ghoom Veterinary dispensary during the year. 42. The buildings of the Dacca Veterinary dispensary, serum cellar and hospital with Veterinary Assistant Surgeon's quarters were com- pleted during the year. Owing to the inability of the Dacca Munici- pality to give tap water connection, a well is being sunk and pump and pipe connection with the dispensary and the Assistant Surgeon's quarters has been provided for. 43. Acquisition of land for the Veterinary dispensary at Narainganj is reported to be under the contemplation of the Dacca District Board. 44. The construction of a Veterinary hospital with quarters for the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon at Tangail was taken up by the Mymensingh Board during the year and the work is in progress. 45. The observation ward for rabid dogs in the Chittagong Veteri- nary dispensary was completed in October last. 46. Improvement in the Noakhali Veterinary hospital by making the floor pucca was made during the year. 47.

GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE AND INDUSTRIES. Veterinary. RESOLUTION2 During the year the veterinary assistants attended 966 outbreaks of Rinderpest, Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia, Anthrax and Blackquarter, in which preventive inoculation was undertaken. The total number of cattle inoculated was 173,762 against 136,418 cattle inoculated in the previous year. The number of deaths among inoculated cattle was 972, or 0.5 per cent. of the total. The immunity secured by the serum simultaneous inoculation was put to a practical test during the outbreak of rinderpest at the Rangpur Cattle Farm in the year under review. Those animals which had been inoculated by this method remained immune from the disease during the outbreak. 5. The veterinary assistant surgeons visited 15.429 villages and treated 100,830 cases, against 15,022 and 94,894, respectively, in the pre- ceding year. 6. Two new dispensaries were opened by the local bodies during the year. The total number of such institutions now stands at 43. The total number of patients treated in these dispensaries was 51,025 against 47,260 in the preceding year. The thanks of Government are due to the District Hoard of Rangpur for the interest taken by it in the matter of expansion of veterinary work in the discrict, where there are seven dispensaries in addition to a veterinary hospital at the district head- quarters. 7.

PrefaceANNUAL REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BENGAL, FOR 1926-27. Preface and General Administration. Charge.6 8. In February I visited Malda and Barasat and inspected the cattle shows there. I also acted as an Examiner at the Annual and Final Examinations of the Bengal Veterinary College. 9. The examinations of the Bengal College continued in March, and I attended these examinations and made time to go up to Santahar to see for myself the work of the staff detailed on the Demonstration Train. I then made arrangements for my visit to Madras, where my services were requisitioned to serve as an Examiner at the Annual Examinations of the Madras Veterinary College, which were held from the 21st to 30th March 1927, both days inclusive. 10. With the exception of two months, October and November 1926, during which period he was on leave, Rai Sahib Sarat Chandra Paul, Assistant Director, was in charge of the Western Range, com- prising the Presidency, Burdwan and Rajshahi Divisions, throughout the year. He spent 51 days on tour and travelled 4,456 miles by rail and 85 miles by road. He inspected the Veterinary Hospitals and Dispensaries at Khulna, Malda, Bogra, Burdwan, Midnapore, Jessore, Jalpaiguri, Dinajpur, Saidpur, Suri, Rangpur and Siliguri, besides attending Glanders cases at Kharagpur, Burdwan and Jalpaiguri and a cattle show at Suri. He also attended the Train Demonstration and lectures at Siliguri, and translated in Bengali the " Notes on Animal Husbandry," prepared by myself and Mr. McLean of the Agricultural Department. 11. Chief Glanders Inspector, Babu Jnanendra Nath Mitter, who acted as Assistant Director for two months during the absence on leave of Rai Sahib S. C. Paul, toured for 8 days during the period. 12. The Eastern Range, comprising the Dacca and Chittagong Divisions, was in charge of the Assistant Director, Babu Nripendra Nath Majumdar, throughout the year. This officer toured for 89 days, and travelled 1,903 miles by rail, 203 miles by road and 1,787 miles by boat and steamer. During his tours he visited Mymensingh, Barisal, Chittagong, Cox's Bazar and Brahmanbaria twice each, and Tangail, Sarisabari, Perojpur, Bhola, Patuakhali, Noakhali, Faridpur, Chandpur and Comilla once each. 13. In addition to the routine work of inspection, he advised local authorities regarding veterinary matters in his area, supervised inocu- lation campaigns against rinderpest in the interior of the districts of Bakarganj and Chittagong, attended outbreaks of Glanders amongst hack ponies at Tangail and Brahmanbaria, and arranged for a cattle show and the veterinary stall at the exhibition held at Dacca in con- nection with the visit of the Royal Commission. He also accompanied me to the Agricultural Conference at Faridpur, and attended the inspec- tion of the work of this Department by the Hon'ble Nawab Bahadur Saiyid Nawab Ali Chaudhuri, Khan Bahadur, c.i.e., the then Member in charge, at Mymensingh. 14. Veterinary Assistant Surgeons N. N. Banarji and N. P. Fernandez continued to be on deputation to foreign service during the year. Veterinary Assistant Surgeon S. L. Sen was allowed leave with- out pay for another year, to continue in the post of Veterinary Inspector, Penang. 15. The work of the subordinate inspecting staff was hampered a good deal, on account of shortage of funds to meet their travelling allowance. For several months the tours of these officers had to be
7 restricted, as the sum voted was too small for the purpose. In Janu- ary an extra allowance of Rs. 1,000 had to be re-appropriated from my budget to meet the cost on this account. Part I8 Bovine Diseases. 25. Rinderpest took a comparatively heavy toll on bovines during the year. It was prevalent more or less throughout the province and accounted for 93 per cent. of the total mortality. The districts which suffered most seriously on this account were Bakarganj, Khulna, Chittagong, Tippera, Faridpur, Birbhum and Pabna. The advantages of inoculation against this disease are being gradually realised by the ryots, and it is gratifying to note that, with the exception of Birbhum, extra assistance was asked for and obtained by the authorities in the other districts to organise inoculation cam- paigns in the affected localities. 26. Foot and Mouth.9 34. These figures exclude 1,628 inoculations performed in Calcutta and its suburbs by the staff of the Bengal Veterinary College. 35. The death rate amongst the inoculated was very small, being 1,980 in all, or 0 .9 for the whole Province. 36. As will be seen from the figures above, there has been an appreciable increase in the number of cattle inoculated, but the work in this direction has been hampered a good deal, owing to the restric- tions imposed by certain District Boards on the supply of serum. As pointed out in last year's report, the staff employed in the districts is wholly insufficient for ordinary needs, and owing to the lack of Staff Veterinary Assistant Surgeons at headquarters, some time elapses before arrangements can be made to find out new graduates and depute them to the affected localities. Free supply of serum and institution of a sufficient number of posts of Staff Veterinary Assistant Surgeons are all that is at present needed to combat effectively the outbreaks of contagious disease in this province. Proposals in this connection have long been submitted to Government, and it is hoped it would be possible to issue orders at an early date. 37. A sum of Rs. 74,535-10 was paid to the Imperial Bacteriologist at Muktesar for the supply of sera and vaccines during the year. Veterinary Assistant Surgeons. 38. Table IV shows the work done in the mufassal and at head- quarters by the itinerant Veterinary Assistant Surgeons in charge of Veterinary Stores. The work done in the mufassal by the itinerant Veterinary Assistant Surgeons in charge of Veterinary Dispensaries is also shown in this Table. 39. Ninety-nine men altogether worked in the mufassal, of whom 72 were in charge of veterinary stores and 27 in charge of veterinary dispensaries, who toured in the interior when required to do so. In addition to the inoculation work referred to in paragraph 33 of this report, these officers visited 16,514 villages and treated 126,661 cases, against 15,429 and 100,830, respectively, in the preceding year. 40. One important feature in connection with this return is the large increase that is taking place year after year in the number of cases brought to the headquarters of the itinerant Veterinary Assistant Surgeons for treatment10 44. The total number of in and out-patients treated was 56,184, and 13,127 cases were supplied with medicines, as against 51,025 and 11,988, respectively, in the previous year. This increase, as also the increase in the number of cases brought to the headquarters of the itinerant Veterinary Assistant Surgeons for treatment, makes it in- creasingly clear that the usefulness of veterinary dispensaries is widely appreciated by the public, and it is hoped that local bodies generally will adopt a forward policy in the matter of the establishment of new dispensaries in their districts. 45. The construction of the dispensary and quarters at Tangail for the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon was completed during the year, and the dispensary, after the name of Rani Dinamoni Chowdhurani of Santosh, was opened in January 1927. The Ward's Estate at Santosh contributed Rs. 7,000 towards the cost of construction. 46. A waiting-shed for patients was added to the veterinary dis- pensary at Sarishabari during the year. 47. Out of the total cost of Rs. 2,300 estimated for the construc- tion of a dispensary with quarters for the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon at Satkhania, the District Board of Chittagong have allotted a sum of Rs. 1,400, and the balance of Rs. 900 has been raised by subscription from the local Union Boards. The work will be taken up shortly. 48. A suitable site has been acquired at Hatiya by the District Board of Noakhali for the construction of a dispensary with quarters for the local Veterinary Assistant Surgeon. The Board have also sanctioned Rs. 2,200 for the construction of a pucca dispensary room at Noakhali, and the building is nearing its completion. 49. Funds have also been allotted by the District Board of Bakarganj for the construction of a kennel in the Sadar Veterinary Hospital, and the question of extension of this hospital is engaging their serious attention. 50. One bigha, of land has been acquired by the District Board of Faridpur for the extension of the local veterinary dispensary. The Board have also provided a sum of Rs. 600 for the construction of a serum cellar. 51. The District Board of the 24-Parganas have decided to con- struct a veterinary hospital at Diamond Harbour, and efforts are being made to take up and complete the work during the year. 52. It is reported that Babu Jogendra Lal Chowdhury, a public- spirited zamindar of Chinsura, has very kindly consented to bear the cost of putting a wire-netting round the two sides of the hospital verandah. The Executive Engineer, Burdwan Division, has been requested to approve the plan, and the work will be started as soon as his approval is obtained. 53. The construction of the dispensary with quarters at Kuri- gram, referred to in the last year's report, was completed during the year. 54. No provision has yet been made by the District Board of Pabna for the construction of a dispensary at the headquarters station of the district, although land for the purpose was acquired years ago.
11 55. The question of erecting a suitable dispensary for Berhampore has been pending for a long time, but nothing has yet been done to remedy the omission. Part III12 64. Rangpur.13 by demonstration of exhibits, lectures and cinema shows to the pub- lic. It is estimated that over a lakh of people visited the Demonstra- tion Train and interested themselves in the exhibits shown on the occasion. After the return of the train to Calcutta, it was kept on view for four days, and on the 28th of March last a meeting was held at the Manson Institute grounds at Sealdah, presided over by Mr. J. N. Gupta, M.B.E., I.C.S., Commissioner, Presidency Division, to afford the high officials and officers of the Departments concerned, as well as public men interested in social welfare problems, to obtain first hand experience and appraise the educative value of the enterprise. Veterinary Inspector Babu M. P. Ghose, who was practically in charge of the Demonstration Train throughout the whole period, deserves special commendation for the work done in this connection. Veterin- ary Assistant Surgeons, Babus H. K. Bose and P. K. Chandra, also worked hard to make the whole show a success. 71. Assistant Directors.14 Itinerant. 1. Babu M. L. Datta, Chittagong. 2.

The Bengal Cruelty to Animals Act, 1920, was introduced into Calcutta on the 1st October 1926 and the Hospital attached to this College was declared an Infirmary under the Act for treatment and care of such animals. 36. We all deeply regret the death of Dr. Sir K. C. Bose, kt., a very longstanding and keen supporter of all matters pertaining to Veterinary Education. Special Remarks. 37. Vice-Principal.42 46. Samples of bone-meal, hides and bristles intended for export were tested for Anthrax Bacilli and other pathogenic organisms. 47. Auto-vaccines were prepared and used in the College Hospital. Horse and buffalo blood were supplied to the Imperial Serologist and others and morbid materials to scientific workers. 48. All requisitions for sera, etc., from Calcutta and the mufassal were promptly attended to. During the year 425,350 doses of anti- rinderpest serum, 20,086 doses of anti-hæmorrhagic septicæmia serum, 2,366 doses of anti-anthrax serum, 305 doses of mallein, 7 doses of tuberculin and 100 doses of black quarter were supplied. 49. Slides showing various infective diseases of animals and specimens and charts of well-bred cattle were sent out. to the district fairs, etc., for exhibition and demonstration with the aid of a magic lantern. Epizootic Diseases of Animals Department in Calcutta. 50. All stables in the Calcutta Glanders area, extending from Barrackpore to Matiaburuz and the town of Howrah, were regularly inspected by the Inspectors. 51. Altogether, 98 horses were seized under the Glanders and Farcy Act, against 120 of last year. Of these, 14 were destroyed for Glanders, 10 died of Glanders, one died of Surra and one died of Epizootic Lyphanzities and the remaining 71 were discharged as free from any of the diseases scheduled under the Act. There was an outbreak of Glanders in the Municipal Gowkhana of Howrah and in the Sodepore Pinjrapole. Prompt action was taken to stamp out the disease. 52. Rupees 75 were given as compensation for 2 horses destroyed. 53. During the year under review, Calcutta and its suburbs were practically free from Rinderpest. This disease broke out in a mild form in the Howrah Municipal Gowkhana and the Sodepur Pinjrapole. Prompt action was taken by this Department to check the disease. 54. During the year, 1,075 cattle were inoculated against Rinder- pest by the Glanders staff, as against 1,334 of last year. 55. The sale proceeds of serum locally, in addition to inoculation fees, amounted to Rs. 1,137-5-6, as against Rs. 4,808-7 realised last year. 56. During the period of closure of the Presidency Remount Depot, 672 horses, 11 cows, 1 calf and 1 bull were inspected by the Inspectors of this Department on boardship prior to their landing at the port of Calcutta. No clinical symptoms of any of the scheduled diseases were found. 57. During the year under report, two of my old and experienced Inspectors were sick for the major portion of the year and both of them, Messrs. A. P. Bagshi and A. T. Biswas, died in harness.

RESOLUTION2 the prevention of diseases, etc. It is hoped that funds will be pro- vided for these purposes in next year's budget. A valuable scheme for thana dispensaries to be administered by groups of Union Boards was drawn up in consultation with, and with the concurrence of, those bodies by the Collector of Faridpur, Mr. L. 13. Burrows, and was submitted to Government by the Veterin- ary Adviser. The scheme was approved by Government but the word- iug of the Village Self-Government Act as it now stands prevents the fulfilment of the scheme in practice. The amendment of the Act is under consideration. 3. The total number of deaths of animals due to epidemic disease was 35,719 as compared with 33,224 in the previous year. The Director attributes this not so much to any actual increase in the prevalence of disease as to a better system of intelligence. Rinderpest with 33,405 deaths accounted for over 93 per cent. of the casualties, while 1,492 beasts died of hæmorrhagie septicæmia, 404 of these being in the district of Miclnapore. Khulna and Bakarganj had over 4,400 deaths each from rinderpest, Chittagong running them close with 3,239. It is noticeable that the Sodepur Pinjrapole had 193 deaths from contagious diseases, a total which exceeded that of either Cooch Behar, Darjeeling, Bogra, Hooghly or Howrah. This, however, is an immense improvement on the two previous years when 1,742 and 805 inmates of this institution succumbed. The Hon'ble Minister is glad to observe that there has been an appreciable increase in the number of cattle inoculated, viz., 206,616 as against 173,762 in the previous year, but there are 25½ million cattle in Bengal and an inoculation rate of less than 1 per cent. can only mean that there is a long way to go before it can be said that the Department has obtained control of epidemic disease. Government will watch with interest when these schemes come into operation the effect of the free supply of serum and of the increased staff, referred to in paragraph 2 above. The usual work of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons was carried on, and 126,661 cases were treated as against 100,830 in the previous year. The staff of reserve Veterinary Assistant Surgeons was increased by 4. Two new dispensaries, one at Kharagpur and one at Tangail, were opened during the year and there were 4 more Veterinary Assistant Surgeons employed by local bodies than in the previous year. There was again an increase in the number of cases treated at dispensaries, viz., 56,184 as against 51,025 or nearly 10 per cent., which is much the same rate as the previous year showed in respect of its predecessor, and a proof that the services of the Department are appreciated. It is satisfactory to observe that the District Board of Faridpur have provided funds for the construction of serum cellar. The Department took its share in that successful enterprise of the Eastern Bengal Railway, the Demonstration Train, and the Veterinary Adviser reports favourably on its results. 4. His Excellency acting with the Minister-in-charge notices with pleasure the names of officers of the Department who did good work during the year and desires to acknowledge also the efficient way in which Mr. Kerr discharged his duties.

PrefaceANNUAL REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BENGAL, FOR THE YEAR 1927-28. Preface and General Administration. Charge.6 5. Babu Nripendra Nath Majumdar, Assistant Director, was on duty in the Eastern Range throughout the year under report. He spent 76 days on tour and travelled 1,285 miles by rail, 220 miles by road and 1,671 miles by boat and steamer. He visited Barisal thrice, Chitta- gong, Cox's Bazar, Brahmanbaria and Narainganj twice each, and Faridpur, Rajbari, Gopalganj, Madaripur, Chandpur, Comilla, Ncakhali, Feni, Sarishabari, Jamalpur and Rangamati once each, and checked and supervised the work of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons in these places. He also attended the inspection of the Veterinary Dispensary at Barisal by His Excellency the Governor and the inspection of the Veterinary Hospital at Dacca by the Hon'ble Minister. He also con- ducted an inoculation campaign in the Agricultural Farm at Manipur, where 88 animals were protected against rinderpest by the serum simul- taneous method. 6. Of the two Veterinary Assistant Surgeons who were on deputa- tion to foreign service, one, viz., N. N. Banarji, was relieved of his appointment under the Sikkim Durbar in January, 1928. The other, viz., N. P. Fernandez, continued to be on deputation during the year. Veterinary Assistant Surgeon S. L. Sen was allowed further leave with- out pay for one year to continue in the post of Veterinary Inspector, Penang. This officer has since returned to duty in this Province. 7. The sum voted for travelling allowance for the subordinate Inspecting Staff is too small to meet the needs of this growing Depart- ment. In January a sum of Rs. 1,500 had to be reappropriated to meet the extra cost on this account. Part I7 11. On a reference to the figures it will be seen that the most strik- ing decrease was under head " Rinderpest." The death rate from Hæmorrhagic septicæmia was, however, somewhat heavy this year, the disease being reported to be rather severe in the districts of Khulna, Bakarganj and Mymensingh. Foot and mouth disease was fairly wide- spread but mortality on this account is not generally heavy. It may be noted that a decrease in the number of cases of contagious disease does not mean that the trouble is dying out. These diseases frequently come in cycles, and a year in which only a few cases occur is commonly followed by a year in which outbreaks are very extensive. Equine Diseases. 12. Glanders.8 23. Contagious diseases amongst other animals.9 169,385 patients during the year, the corresponding figures for the two previous years being 16,514 villages and 126,661 animals and 15,429 villages and 100,830 animals, respectively. These figures speak for themselves and no comment is necessary. 33. The number of cases brought to the headquarters of the Itiner- ant Veterinary Assistant Surgeons for treatment also shows a satisfac- tory increase as compared with the figures of the previous year. This increase, which is taking place year after year, shows the urgent neces- sity of starting more dispensaries and it is hoped local bodies will realise the importance of this matter and try to work up to the programme of a dispensary in each district and subdivisional headquarters with a Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge. Hospitals and Dispensaries. 34. Table V shows the working of the hospitals and dispensaries in this Province. 35. The number of such institutions in 1926-27 was 45. No new hospital or dispensary was opened during the year. 36. The total number of animals treated both as in- and out-patients was 71,159 and 21,290 cases were supplied with medicines as against 56,184 and 13,127 cases, respectively, in the previous year. The increase, which is satisfactory, is evidence of the fact that the useful- ness of these institutions is being fully appreciated by the public. 37. The construction of buildings for the Noakhali Veterinary Dispensary was completed during the year and the dispensary was opened by the then Hon'ble Minister in charge in July 1927. 38. The Noakhali Board have completed the land acquisition pro- ceedings for the Veterinary Dispensary at Hatiya and a sum of Rs. 6,000 has been set apart for the construction of necessary buildings at that station. 39. The Chittagong District Board have provided funds for the construction of a waiting shed for patients at the Cox's Bazar Dispensary and have also sanctioned the cost to provide for the corrugated iron roofing of the dispensary and quarters. Negotiations for acquiring land for the Veterinary Dispensary at Satkania are also in progress. 40. The Dacca District Board have acquired a plot of land near the Chashara railway station at Narainganj for the construction of the Local Board office and the Veterinary Dispensary. 41. The Faridpur District Board have provided funds for the con- struction of a serum cellar at Faridpur. They have also constructed a Veterinary Dispensary at Gopalganj. The construction of quarters for the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon there is now in progress. 42. The Mymensingh District Board have taken up the construction of a serum cellar at the Sadar Dispensary. The question of water- supply at the Sarishabari Veterinary Dispensary is, however, pending for a long time but nothing has yet been done to remove the grievance. 43. It is satisfactory to note that the District Board of Pabna have at last found it possible to allot a sum of Rs. 12,000 for the construction of a Veterinary Hospital and quarters for the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon at Pabna. This scheme was pending for twelve years for want of funds.
10 44. A sum of Rs. 1324-5 has been placed at the disposal of the Rangpur Board by the proprietors of the Panga Fair for the development of veterinary work in that District. 45. The District Board of Rajshahi have constructed a new serum cellar at the Veterinary Hospital at the headquarters station of the District. 46. There is a scheme for the construction of a dog ward in the Veterinary Hospital at Chinsura and it is reported that a sum of Rs. 757-8 has been obtained from the Divisional Commissioner as grant in this connection. Part III11 55. Manipur.12 of District and Local Boards to assist the inhabitants of the Province, how can they do it better than by insisting that their cattle should be kept healthy and free from disease ? No cattle, no food, no population, what then is the use of education, public health, good communications, etc.? The actual direct loss in money to the Presidency, through animals becoming diseased and dying is enormous, and could nearly all be saved by calling in Veterinary assistance and the indirect loss is probably incalculable. Other provinces are quickly realising that veterinary work has been relegated to an inferior position for far too long, why should this pro- vince lag behind ? It is refreshing to see that a ray of light has pene- trated the darkness, in the case of the Naogaon Dispensary, which is, after many years of thought, about to be built, and in Berhampore where provision is being made for a Hospital. Hopes are entertained that similar light will dissipate the blackness in which veterinary work lies in other places. Several schemes for improvement are held up for want of funds, such as " Free distribution of serum," " Increase of pay of Veterinary Assistant Surgeons," " Division of work into three Ranges," " Staff Veterinary Assistant Surgeons," etc. There is, however, little hope of them maturing for same time. 63. In the midst of these depressing circumstances it is a pleasure to record that a sum of Rs. 324 has been placed at the disposal of the Rangpur Board by the proprietors of the Panga Fair for the improve- ment and expansion of Veterinary aid in that district. 64.

The main results of receipts and expenditure of the College, compiled by my office and duly verified by the Accountant-General, Bengal, are given in Table I of my report. General Remarks. 35. The reconstituted Committee of Management of this College held three meetings during the year. They discussed all-important matters connected with the College. With the exception of the members named below all other members attended the meetings regularly: 42 38. I regret to record the death of Babu Nanda Lall Mitter, Lecturer, which melancholy event took place on 10th January 1928. He was a most conscientious and able worker. 39. A scheme for a post-graduate course of a few months' duration is under preparation and it will be submitted to the Government for sanction soon. 40. The District Boards of Bengal are, it would seem, gradually becoming less and less interested in, and sympathetic with, the objects of this Institution, as the awards of stipends to the deserving bona fide youths of the province for Veterinary education are slowly decreasing in number. Comparative annual figures of the necessary drop in this direction will be submitted to Government separately, as also comparative figures of similar awards of District Boards of other provinces, such as Bihar and Orissa. The Cossipore-Chitpore Municipality used to award in the past a stipend to a local inhabitant to this College but this also was discontinued on the amalgamation of such municipalities with the Calcutta Corporation. Special Remarks. 41. Vice-Principal.43 3. During the year under review, Rinderpest broke out in mild form in Calcutta and its suburbs, prompt action was taken by this Department to check the disease. During the year, 1,085 cattle were inoculated against Rinderpest by the Glanders staff against 1,075 of the last year. The sale proceeds of serum locally in addition to the inoculation fees amounted to Rs. 1,902-10 as against Rs. 1,137-5-6 realised last year. 4. During the period of closure of the Presidency Remount Depot, 9 horses and 3 zebras were inspected by the Glanders Inspectors on boardship prior to their landing at the port of Calcutta. No clinical symptoms of any of the scheduled diseases were found. Raymond Research Laboratory. The Laboratory continued to do good and useful work as the follow- in'? details will show. 2. During the year 138 brains of different species of animals were examined for rabies of which 109 proved positive, 26 negative and 3 were unfit for examination. Seven hundred and forty pathological specimens, received from the various districts of Bengal as also from the College hospital, Army Remount Depot and other sources were examined. Samples of urine, fæces and milk were also examined. 3. Autopsies were made on carcases received from the Calcutta and Bengal Police, Zoological Gardens, private bodies and other sources as well as on all animals which died or were destroyed in this College, except in cases where a wish had been expressed by the owners to the contrary. My Senior Assistant of the Laboratory had to give expert evidence in many cases. 4. Cases of anthrax, glanders, blackquarter, strangles, canine and bovine piroplasmosis, demodectic scabies in dog, equine and bovine sura, hæmorrhagic septicæmia, fowl cholera, strongylosis in cattle, tuberculosis in monkey, rabbit septicaemia; canine hæmogregarinosis, filariasis, ankylostomiasis and similar entozoal infestations of equines and bovines were diagnosed. 5. Auto-vaccines were prepared and extensively used in the College hospital as well as on some hundreds newly imported horses of Army Remount Depôt with success and were supplied also to other private bodies. Blood from different species of animals was supplied to the Imperial Serologist and others and morbid materials to many scientific workers. 6. Experiments were made with Auto-vaccine prepared at the Laboratory in the treatment of various skin affections in dogs particularly of the Demodectic type. No definite opinion can be formed as to the efficacy of this treatment until a larger number of experiments have been made. 7. Samples of bone-meal and hide cuttings intended for export were bacteriologically examined for the detection of anthrax and other pathogenic organisms. 8. Numerous requisitions for sera, etc., from Calcutta and mufassal were received. During the year 252,600 doses of anti- rinderpest serum; 33,940 doses of anti-hæmorrhagic septicæmia serum; 3900 doses of anti-anthrax serum; 485 doses of mallein; 80 doses of
44 tuberculin; 200 doses of blackquarter serum; 50 doses of black leg aggressin and 100 doses of quarter-ill vaccine were supplied. 9. New charts picturing stages of various infective diseases of animals and slides of well-bred cattle and others of pathological interest were prepared and sent out to the Demonstration Train for exhibition as well as to districts at different fairs and shows. 10. At the seventh Congress of the Far Eastern Association of Tropical Medicine held in Calcutta, in December last, numerous morbid specimens of varying interest were exhibited. 11. For the purchase of some up-to-date bacteriological apparatus and instruments, a list was made and submitted to Government for sanction with a view to being better equipped for the Post-graduate Course to be started from the next session of the College. 12. The College collection of entozoa was overhauled and reclassi- fied under the more recent nomenclature. Doubtful specimens are sent abroad for identification. 13. Mr. Ganguly, Assistant-in-charge, worked during the year with exceptional keenness and ability. A. D. MACGREGOR, f.r.c.v.s., i.v.s., Principal, Bengal Veterinary College.

DARJEELING, the 17th OCTOBER 1928. RESOLUTION2 admitted, however, in all fairness to local bodies, that the increasing calls which are made upon limited financial resources particularly on the side of medical and public health work make it inevitable that they should cut down expenditure somewhere and veterinary interests are not the only ones that have suffered. A noticeable exception, however, is the Nadia District Board who were enterprising enough to organise a travelling exhibition in which the Veterinary as well as the Public Health and Agriculture Depart- ments took part. The scheme for thana veterinary dispensaries under the adminis- tration of Union Boards, to which reference was made in last year's review, has not yet materialised, as the amendment to the Village Self- Government Act, which was necessary in order to make it possible, had to be dropped after being introduced in the present session of the Legislative Council. The future of the Bill is still, however, under consideration. 3. The year was a mild one so far as epidemic diseases were concerned, but, as Mr. Davis points out, these things go in cycles, and diminution of outbreaks in a particular year is no indication that such diseases are dying out. The total number of deaths from epidemic diseases was 15,459 as against 35,719 in the previous year. The deaths from rinderpest, which accounted for 76 per cent. of the total, fell from 33,405 to 11,790. Hæmorrhagic septicæmia, on the other hand, showed a slight increase from 1,492 to 1,899. Tippera heads the rinderpest list with 1,611 deaths, closely followed by Chittagong with 1,521, and Mymensingh with 935. The casualties in Khulna and Bakarganj fell from over 4,400 each to 473 and 688, respectively. The deaths in Sodepur Pinjrapole fell from 189 to 142. During the year 113,757 inoculations were performed as against. 206,616 in the previous year, but this was in respect of a number of outbreaks which was less by more than half than that of the previous year. The death rate among inoculated animals was negli- gible. It is satisfactory to observe that there is very little opposition to inoculation. There was again an increase of patients treated by Veterinary Assistant Surgeons on tour, viz., 169,385 as against 126,661, an increase of over 33 per cent., while the number of cases treated at dispensaries and hospitals rose from 56,184 to 71,159, or by over 26 per cent. (the rate of increase last year was 10 per cent.). These figures indicate that the animal-owner at any rate is appreciat- ing more and more the value of veterinary attendance, and show that there is a need for more dispensaries and a bigger staff. Yet no new hospital or dispensary was opened during the year and there was no increase of staff. The Hon'ble Minister is glad to note, however, that the Mymen- singh District Board have undertaken the construction of a serum cellar at their Sadar Dispensary; that the Pabna District Board have allotted Rs. 12,000 for the construction of a Veterinary Hospital and quarters for the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon at Pabna; and that the Rajshahi District Board have constructed a serum cellar at the headquarters veterinary hospital. The Department participated once more in the Eastern Bengal Railway Demonstration Train.
3 4. His Excellency, acting with his Minister, notices with pleasure the names of officers of the Department who did good work during the year and desires also to acknowledge the care and atten- tion which Messrs. Kerr and Davis devoted to their duties. II.4 10. The Minister would conclude this resolution by stating that he has to discharge the duty of reviewing the administration of a year in the policy or supervision of which he had no hand and so naturally he had to proceed on records as he found them. The diffi- culties of his delicate task have been further enhanced by the fact that he had to undertake this duty even before he had a reasonable time to shape his own policy.

PrefaceAnnual Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Bengal, for the year 1928-29. Preface and General Administration. Mr. R. T. Davis, I.v.s. continued to act in my place as Director and Veterinary Adviser to Government from the beginning of the year till the 17th October 1928, when he reverted to his substantive appoint- ment as Vice-Principal, Bengal Veterinary College. The Puja holi- days were then about to begin and I returned to duty from leave in England during these holidays on the 22nd of October last, and con- tinued in charge for the remainder of the year. 2. During the period of seven months that he remained in charge Mr. Davis spent 38 days on tour and travelled 4,804 miles by rail, 55 miles by road and 254 miles by steamer. He inspected the veterinary work at Mymensingh, Darjeeling, Ghoom, Kurseong, Naogaon, Asansol and Dacca, and suggested means for the improvement and expansion of veterinary aid in these places. He also laid the founda- tion stone of the Naogaon Dispensary. In September last he went to Simla to attend the Conference held under the auspices of His Excellency the Viceroy to secure the prompt and co-ordinate considera- tion for the recommendations made by the Royal Commission on Agri- culture in India. 3. After my return from England much time had to be devoted to the disposal of urgent work at headquarters. Routine tours were there- fore curtailed to the minimum and I visited only those places where my presence was essentially necessary. In the course of these tours I checked and supervised the work of the subordinate staff at Rangpur, Gaibandha, Kalimpong, Chinsura, Dacca, Mymensingh, Burdwan, Khulna and Barisal and consulted and advised local bodies, as usual, regarding the rural problems connected with this department. I also attended a meeting of the Cattle Improvement Committee at Rangpur and gave my views regarding the selection of livestock kept in this farm. At Chinsura I impressed upon the local body concerned the early necessity of reviving the post of Itinerant Veterinary Assistant Surgeon at Sheoraphuli in the Serampore subdivision, and at Burdwan discussed with the Collector and the Chairman, District Board, the feasibility of retaining at least one of the two additional posts of Itinerant Veterinary Assistant Surgeon proposed for abolition in that district. In December I attended the Kalimpong Mela and acted as a judge in the cattle show there. In January I visited Dacca and supervised the arrangements made by the Assistant Director, Eastern Range, for the serum simultaneous inoculation of a batch of cattle in the Manipur Farm. In February I inspected the work of the staff detailed on the Demonstration Train and presided at Gaibandha over an open air lecture given on the care and treatment of animals with the aid of cinema films. A free demonstration of serum simultaneous inoculation against rinderpest was also organised during this month under my direct supervision at the instance of Mr. Donovan, the
6 Collector of Bakarganj, at Char Patharghata to demonstrate to pri- vate owners the benefit and usefulness of this method of treatment. Altogether 891 animals were protected. All the Inspectors stationed in the Eastern Range and certain selected Veterinary Assistant Surgeons were given training in this camp to enable them to under- take this system of treatment independently in their respective juris- diction. It is hoped that this demonstration will prove of great value, but sufficient time has not yet elapsed to judge of its benefit. It would not have been possible to carry out this work but for the keen interest and invaluable help of Mr. Donovan, I.c.s., Collector of Bakarganj. He overcame all difficulties of transport and local arrangements in- cidental to working in such a remote corner of the Province. In March I acted as an examiner at the Annual and Final Examinations of the Bengal Veterinary College. 4. My tours occupied a period of 27 days and I travelled 2,740 miles by rail, 80 miles by road and 515 miles by steamer. 5. With the exception of two months and a half from the 16th of September last, when he was away on leave, Rai Sahib Sarat Chandra Paul, Assistant Director, was in charge of the Western Range, comprising the Presidency, Burdwan and Rajshahi Divisions, throughout the year. He was on tour for 37 days, and travelled 2,413 miles by rail and 69 miles by road. He inspected the work of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons at Bankura, Garbetta, Midnapore, Kharagpur, Chinsura, Rampurhat, Suri, Jessore, Krishnagar, Asansol, Rangpur, Khulna, Basirhat and Vishnupur, conducted tuberculin test in the Jail cattle at Bankura as well as mallein test for Glanders in horses at Kharagpur. He also represented the department at the Agricultural and Industrial Exhibitions at Rangpur and Basirhat, and acted as a judge at the cattle show held at Khulna for the selection and award of prizes to the successful competitors. 6. During the leave period above mentioned, Maulvi M. S. Chaudhuri officiated as Assistant Director, Western Range. He toured for 23 days, and travelled 1,670 miles by rail and 32 miles by road. He visited Khulna, Kushtia, Rangpur, Jalpaiguri, Siliguri, Kurseong, Ghoom and Darjeeting on inspection work, and attended an outbreak of Glanders at Atipara in the Nadia district. 7. The Eastern Range comprising the two Divisions of Dacca and Chittagong was in charge of Babu Nripendra Nath Mazumdar, Assistant Director, throughout the year, with the exception of one month when he was on leave in continuation of the Durga Puja holidays and Veterinary Inspector Babu Kshitish Chandra Pramanik of Jalpaiguri acted as Assistant Director in his place. The latter toured for 16 days, and visited Munshiganj, Chittagong, Cox's Bazar and Rangamati. His time was fully taken up with the suppression of a severe outbreak of Surra amongst hack ponies in Chittagong Municipality. 8. During the period he was in charge Babu Nripendra Nath Mazumdar was on tour for 74 days, and visited Kishoreganj, Netro- kona, Chandpur, Comilla, Manikganj, Sarisabari, Tangail, Narain- ganj and Rajbari, once each, Faridpur twice and Barisal thrice. He travelled 1,394 miles by rail, 176 miles by boat and road and 2.087 miles by steamer.
7 In addition to routine inspections of the work of Veterinary Assistant Surgeons he attended and investigated outbreaks of Rinder- pest in several villages in the Bakarganj district and acted as a judge in the cattle show at Faridpur. He also assisted rne in arranging for the demonstration campaign of inoculation against Rinderpest by the serum simultaneous method at Patharghata and himself made arrangements for similar campaign at Kamrangachar in the neigh- bourhood of Dacca. 9. The only Veterinary Assistant Surgeon who is now on deputa- tion to foreign service is Mr. N. P. Fernandez. He is still employed in Mesopotamia. Veterinary Assistant Surgeon Babu N. N. Baner- jee, who was employed on foreign service under the Sikkim Durbar, was allowed leave for 11 months and 3 days with effect from the 19th January, 19288 No compensation was paid for the compulsory destruction of any animals under the Act. 16-17. Anthrax and Dourine.9 Preventive Inoculation. 27. Table III shows the record of preventive inoculations per- formed during the year. 28. Inoculation was undertaken in 596 outbreaks and 122,675 animals were protected as against 113,757 animals in 532 outbreaks in the preceding year. Details of inoculation are as follow: 10 Hospitals and Dispensaries. 35. Table V shows the working of the hospitals and dispensaries, which numbered 44 in the Province during the year. 36. The number of in- and out-patients treated at these dispen- saries was 60,606 and 9,353 cases were supplied with medicines as against 71,159 and 21,290 cases, respectively, in the previous year. The decrease is attributed partly to the closure of the Municipal Veterinary Dispensary at Narainganj as also to the decrease in the number of outbreaks of foot and mouth disease at district and sub- divisional headquarters during the year. 37. The hospital at Dacca, as well as the quarters of the Veteri- nary Assistant Surgeon attached thereto, were provided with electric lights and fans during the year. 38. There had been a proposal for the transfer of a piece of land measuring .005 of an acre to the Eastern Bengal Railway Autho- rities from the compound of the Dacca Veterinary Hospital for a road diversion in connection with the scheme for the remodelling of the Dacca Station yard and it has been decided to make over the land on payment of its market value and a recurring sum of Rs. 6-13-6 as annual rent subject to the condition that the compound wall and latrine would be rebuilt by the Railway at their own cost. 39. The Veterinary Stores at Narainganj was shifted during the year to one of the rooms of the newly constructed building for the Local Board Office there. 40. The Maharaja of Susang in Mymensingh contemplates open- ing a Veterinary Dispensary on his own estate in collaboration with the District Board, but the scheme has not matured as yet. 41. The construction of a serum cellar at the Mymensingh Hospital was taken up during the year and is nearing completion. 42. The defects in the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon's quarters at Tangail, which were pointed out to the Board, were rectified and a shed for sweeper and a stand for out-patients were constructed during the year. 43. The question of sinking a tube-well in the compound of the Sarishabari Veterinary Dispensary was under the contemplation of the Board, but nothing has been done as yet. 44. Proposals for the construction of Veterinary Dispensary at Jamalpur with quarters for the Assistant Surgeon on a piece of Gov- ernment land are in progress. 45. The construction of Veterinary Dispensary and Serum Cellar at Faridpur was under the contemplation of the District Board, but the work could not be taken up owing to paucity of funds. The Board, however, constructed a dispensary shed with Veterinary Assistant Surgeon's quarters at Gopalganj during the year. 46. A dog kennel in the Barisal Veterinary Hospital was under construction this year and a proposal for acquisition of more land for further improvements of the hospital was submitted by the Board to Government for sanction.
11 47. Acquisition of land for dispensary and quarters for the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon at Satkania was in progress and work of construction will be undertaken as soon as possession of the land is made over to the Board. 48. The corrugated iron roofing of the Cox's Bazar Dispensary and erection of a waiting shed were completed during the year. 49. The venerable Rani Saheba of Dimla in the district of Rangpur has kindly contributed Rs. 1,000 towards the construction of the Veterinary Dispensary at that station. Our thanks are due to the Rani Saheba and her able manager, Babu Kamini Kumar Singh Roy, for this generous donation. 50. A sum of Rs. 1,300 was realised up to the end of the year by Babu S. B. Ghose, Stationary Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Chin- sura, for the construction of a dog ward in the hospital. Babu Jogendra Lal Chaudhuri, zemindar, Chinsura, kindly met the cost of putting up wire-netting round the stables of the hospital to protect the patients from crows. 51. The proprietors of Panga, Kachukata and Darwani fairs contributed Rs. 372, Rs. 52-5 and Rs. 500, respectively, for the improvement of veterinary aid in the Rangpur district. It is hoped that other cattle fair proprietors will be public spirited and make similar contributions for the benefit of the cattle from the sale of which they derive income. 52. The Hospital at Naogaon with quarters for the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon was nearing completion at the end of the year. Part III.12 Bull Breeding and Rearing Farms. 58. There are three such farms in this Province13 owing to their financial stringency during 1924-25. Sanction was also asked for regarding the retention for a further period of one year till 31st March 1930 of the post of Itinerant Veterinary Assistant Surgeon at Kakdwip as well as for the permanent deputation of a third Veterinary Assistant Surgeon for the Cooch Behar State and the entertainment of a substitute in his place. 66. The District Board of Burdwan moved, through the Divi- sional Commissioner, for the withdrawal of the two additional posts of Itinerant Veterinary Assistant Surgeon created during the year 1927-28. The matter was under the consideration of Government till the close of the year. Part V.14 (a) Serum supply.15 (vi) the study of parasites of cattle. (vii) the study of non-sweating in horses. (viii) the study of kumri in horses. (ix) the study of rabies inoculation of dogs. Until such an officer is appointed Bengal will not be able to take its place with other provinces and do its share in research work in India. It is hoped that funds may soon be found to enable this depart- ment to start on the course of progress already mapped out, an out- line of which has been given above. Dual Control.16 EASTERN RANGE.

(a) The Advisory Committee of Management of this College- held three meetings during the year under report and discussed all important matters concerned with the College. Recommendations have been sent up to Government for the nomination of new members in places of those who have ceased to be such from July 1928. (It) The rules of the College, the Hospital and the Hostels are being revised. (c) Babu Debendra Kumar Sen, Lecturer, Bengal Veterinary College, was granted leave on urgent private affairs from 18th Feb- ruary 1929 till end of the year. Mr. R. C. Mukherjee, Assistant Lecturer, officiated in his place. (d) The Government of Bihar and Orissa have decided to open a Veterinary College of their own at Patna next year. (e) During the year under report, a new Post-mortem Room was built departmentally with the sanction of Government at an estimated cost of Rs. 1,521-3. (f) Three College tanks were re-excavated during the year for the improvement of water-supply of the cultivation work. (g) The following subject is under the consideration of the Com- mittee of Management of the Bengal Veterinary College and Govern- ment will be moved as soon as a decision is arrived at by the Com- mittee.
48 It seems that the District Boards in Bengal are authorised by Government to spend some of their resources in the spread of Veteri- nary Education in Bengal under the Local Self-Government Act (as in the case of Industrial Education). But there is no binding clause for such expenditure in the aforesaid Act. Bengal is in a very back- ward state so far as veterinary science is concerned in comparison with other provinces. No country can prosper unless the agricultural problem is improved. Time is, therefore, fast approaching when, with a view to alleviating the unemployment question, Government should be approached to impress upon the District, Local and Union Boards in the Presidency of Bengal to set apart a moiety of their resources for granting aid (at Rs. 20 per month), to deserving youths of the districts in the way of monetary help to them during the pro- secution of their studies at the Bengal Veterinary College. This should naturally be followed up with employment of such men, when qualified, for a period of 5 years under the Board granting such aid. Under this system, the Board will be able to secure qualified Veteri- nary Assistant Surgeons for their districts for the health and welfare of all local animals. Raymond Research Laboratory. The Laboratory continued to do useful work in examining and reporting upon brains of different species of rabid animals in order to confirm clinical diagnosis and to expedite treatment of human beings bitten by such. 2.

The most noticeable event which has taken place since the classs of the year is that Government have issued orders regarding the free supply of serum to local bodies with retrospective effect from 1st April 1927. This has relieved these bodies of a charge of Rs. 70,000 per annum, and it is hoped that they will now bear their legitimate shar of the veterinary expenditure more readily than hitherto. 5. It is pleasing to note that the year under review has been generally a healthy one for the live-stock of the province. Rinderpest continues to be the most serious scourge, being responsible for 67 per cent. of the deaths reported from bovine diseases. A very important feature of the campaign of the year was a free demonstration of the serum simultaneous method of inoculation against rinderpest organise at char Patharghata in the district of Bakarganj. It is hoped that the demonstration will prove of real value. It may be expected that the gradual extension of the serum simultaneous method of inoculation will tend towards the reduction of the death rate on account of rinder- pest. In this connection Government note with satisfaction that the death rate among inoculated animals was negligible during the year. 6. The record of the working of the veterinary hospitals and dis- pensaries is not very satisfactory, the number of such institution having been reduced from 45 to 44. The most striking feature appear to be the abrupt fall from 21,290 to 9,353 in the number of cases no brought to hospital but supplied with medicine. The reasons as state in the report do not seem to explain adequately this abnormal decreas and the matter requires further investigation. Government join with the Director in thanking the Rani Brindarani Chaudhurani, of Dimla for her generous contribution towards the construction of the veterinary dispensary at that station and note with pleasure that the Maharaja Susang in Mymensingh also contemplates opening a veterinary dis- pensary on his own estate in collaboration with the district board. 1 is hoped that other landlords of the province will emulate these efforts. 7. It is satisfactory to notice that cattle fairs and shows continue to be attended by departmental officers who took these opportunities of delivering lectures on veterinary matters and of explaining to the people the modern methods of treatment of diseases and of management of cattle. This is essentially necessary for the development of veterin- ary knowledge among cultivators who are proverbially conservative. 8. Government note with pleasure the names of officers of the department who did good work during the year and desire also acknowledge the services of Messrs. Kerr and Davis for their efficient administration of the department. II. The Bengal Veterinary College. 9. Government are gratified to note that the demand for admission into the college shows an increase. With the opening of a Veterinary College at Patna students will, of course, cease to come from Bihar and Orissa, but in view of the increase in the number of students from Bengal seeking admission into the college, it does not seem probably that the position will be affected very seriously. At the same time Government would again take this opportunity of urging that bodies be prepared to bear their legitimate share of veterinary exper diture specially as they are now being supplied with serum free charge.
3 It is most disappointing to note that the district board stipends in Bengal compare very unfavourably with those of other provinces. The attention of the boards is drawn to the matter. 10. Government note with satisfaction that the Raymond Research Laboratory has maintained its record of continued good work during the year under review. 11. The recommendations of the Royal Commission on Agriculture lating to the Veterinary Department are being considered by Gov- ernment. Such of the accepted recommendations as may involve addi- tional expenditure must, unhappily, await better financial conditions, while effect will be given to others as early as may be practicable. 12. Government desire to acknowledge the care and attention which Messrs. MacGregor and Davis devoted to the administration of the college and would also record their appreciation of the manner in which the committee of management have conducted their work.

Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Bengal, for the year 1929-30. Preface and General Administration. 1. I was in charge of this Department as Director and Veterinary Adviser to Government throughout the year. I was on tour for 74 days and travelled 9,018 miles by rail, 84 miles by road and 1,080 miles by steamer. 2. I visited Khulna, Dacca and Darjeeling twice each and Ranaghat, Bogra, Barisal, Chinsura, Mymensingh, Patharghata and Khepupara. In June, I visited Simla and attended the inaugural meeting of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research. In December, I attended a meeting of the Board of Agriculture and the second meeting of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research at Pusa. 3. The scheme for protection with Serum Simultaneous inoculation against Rinderpest of the cattle of the raiyats in certain Khas Mahal areas in the Bakarganj district was given effect to in February last and I personally conducted the operations in collaboration with the Collector and the Khas Mahal Officers stationed there. The scheme was successful and 1,243 head of cattle (including buffaloes) were protected by this method without any fatality. Full success of this camp was however marred by the fact that the cattle owners were not all willing to pay for this inoculation, though the minimum charge covering the cost of serum only was made. The estimate of the local officers that several thousand of animals would be brought was not fulfilled. Four Veterinary Assistant Surgeons of the Bakarganj district were given training in this method of inoculation in this camp. It is hoped to popularise this method of inoculation in this Province by giving small demonstrations in each district year by year as funds permit. The need for making a charge for it is a great drawback. It is becoming exceedingly popular in Madras where it is given free. 4. The examinations of the Bengal Veterinary College were held in March last, and I attended these examinations and then proceeded to Madras, where my services were requisitioned to serve as an examiner at the annual examinations of the Madras Veterinary College, which were held from the 22nd to the 31st March, 1930. 5. With the exception of about four months from the 22nd of August last, during which period he was away on leave for reasons of health, Rai Sahib Sarat Chandra Paul, Assistant Director, was in charge of the Western Range throughout the year. He spent 28 days on tour and travelled 1,974 miles by rail and 57 miles by road. He was at Rangpur thrice in connection with Serum Simultaneous inoculation by Goat Virus, Blackleg Aggressin, and Protective Serum inoculation against Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia of the Government Farm cattle there. He also visited the Veterinary Hospitals at Midnapore, Jalpaiguri and Rangpur, attended an outbreak of Glanders at Jalpaiguri and acted as a Judge in the Cattle Show at Barasat. 6. Babu Nripendra Nath Majumdar, Assistant Director, was transferred from the Eastern to the Western Range during the absence
6 on leave of Rai Sahib Sarat Chandra Paul. His tours in this Range covered a period of 21 days and he travelled 2,438 miles by rail and 68 miles by road. He visited Chinsura, Bankura, Rajshahi and Rangpur and checked and supervised the work of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons in charge. He also paid a visit to Bhaluka to enquire into the possibilities of inoculation against Rinderpest by the Serum Simultaneous method. In December he went to Kalimpong and assisted in the judging of cattle for selection and award of prizes to the successful competitors. 7. Two officers worked in the Eastern Range during the year under report. These were Babu N. N. Mazumdar and Maulvi M. S. Chaudhuri. Details of their work are given below. 8. Assistant Director, Babu N. N. Mazumdar, was in charge from the beginning of the year till the 28th of August, when he left for Calcutta to take over charge of the Western Range. During this period he toured for 18 days and travelled 224 miles by rail, 79 miles by road and 344 miles by boat and steamer. In the course of these tours he visited Chittagong, Cox's Bazar and the villages Chokoria and Kakra in connection with widespread outbreak of cattle disease. He also undertook Serum Simultaneous inoculation of the Farm cattle at Manipur and also of cattle belonging to one Babu H. P. Chatterjee at Nilkhet and Kamrangachar. 9. Maulvi M. S. Chaudhuri, Veterinary Inspector, officiated as Assistant Director during the absence on deputation of Babu N. N. Majumdar to the Western Range and also when the latter went on leave for four months with effect from the 19th December last. He was thus in charge of the Eastern Range for seven months during this year. During his incumbency he toured for 65 days and visited Comilla, Chandpur, Feni, Noakhali, Chittagong, Barisal, Faridpur, Sarisabari once each, and Mymensingh thrice, and at all these places he inspected the Veterinary Hospitals and Dispensaries. He travelled 1,192 miles by rail, 166 miles by road and 1,060 miles by steamer and interviewed District and Subdivisional Officers as well as Chairmen of District Boards and explained to them the necessity of increasing the Veterinary Staff in their districts. In addition to this work he visited the Government Dairy Farm at Manipur, the Co-operative Milk Societies' Breeding Farm at Dhanmondai and the Dacca Central Jail. He also assisted me in Serum Simultaneous inoculation campaign held in the Bakarganj district in February last. 10. The only Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, who is now on Foreign Service in Iraq, is Mr. N. P. Fernandez. His deputation commenced in 1921 and was being extended from year to year. The question of his permanent retention by the Iraq Government had been under consideration for about three years and it is gratifying to note that a decision has now been arrived at in regard to this matter. Part I.7 officer has been at work for only nine months during this year. It is early yet to give any definite opinion on the results achieved, since it is impossible for one man to do full justice to the vast work that lies before him in this Province. The attention of this officer was mainly devoted to those districts where big cattle fairs or important conferences were held. He visited and gave lectures at the following places:8 18. Other diseases.9 Rinderpest, Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia and Blackquarter during the year. Details of inoculation are given below :10 Hospitals and Dispensaries. 33. Table V shows in detail the working of the Hospitals and Dispensaries in this Province. 34. Two Veterinary Stores.11 46. The District Board of Rangpur took up the work of construction of the Veterinary Dispensary at Dimla at the end of this year and have further sanctioned the cost of adding an additional room to the Sadar Veterinary Hospital at Rangpur. 47. One stud bull was presented to the Managing Committee of the Veterinary Hospital at Chinsura by the Mohunt of Guptipara in the Hooghly district. 48. The Raja of Tajhat has also been pleased to make a free gift of land for the Veterinary Dispensary at Saidpur in the Rangpur district. 49. Cooch Behar.12 (6) prevention of the sale of sick cattle; (c) prevention of melas in places where diseases is already prevailing; and (d) dissolution of melas if there occurs any outbreak of serious nature in the course of the melas or in places near about. Some of the proprietors have commenced to pay a nominal contribution at one anna per animal sold, which goes to the District Boards now, but in view of the fact that these melas are the sources of cattle disease and that serum charges are no longer borne by the local bodies, I suggest some contribution, say four annas per animal sold, should be realised in equal shares from the dealers and the proprietors and paid to Government every year. In return for this Government might supply a special Veterinary Assistant Surgeon to attend during the whole mela and a temporary camp dispensary for treatment of clinical cases: also serum if required for contagious diseases. This matter is now engaging the attention of the Husbandry Wing of the Board of Agriculture. Bull Breeding and Rearing Farms. 55. Three such farms were at work in this Province during the year: one at Kalimpong, another at Rangpur and the third at Dacca. The first is managed by St. Andrew's Colonial Homes and the last two by the Agricultural Department. 56. Rangpur.13 necessary. Both animals eventually died while under observation. Thanks are due to the authorities of the Kalimpong Homes for presenting these animals for investigation, and to the Director of the School of Tropical Medicine for placing the help of his Expert Staff at our disposal. Horse and Pony Stallion. 59. There was no horse or pony stallion in this Province. Tables X, XI and XII are therefore blank. Part IV.14 to accelerate the supply of sera to the seat of outbreaks of disease and prevent considerable loss due to sera deterioration as a result of prolonged exposure to high temperature. 65. The various recommendations put forward by the Royal Commission on Agriculture in regard to diseases of live-stock and their control have all been considered by Government. Most of these should be brought into effect as soon as financial and other circumstances permit. There are however many obstacles to be overcome in order to bring the Departmental cadre up to anything like the strength recommended, chief among these being lack of funds and the difficulty of obtaining recruits of the right type in sufficient numbers. The wide margin now existing between the cadre recommended by the Commission and that at present is worthy of notice. The question of legislation in connection with the control of contagious diseases is another matter which requires careful consideration as it involves the necessity of co-operation of all Provinces throughout India. 66.

The dog-run continued to provide a healthful recreation ground for the more convalescent of the patients. A new building has been constructed at a safe distance from the General Ward to be used as a "Canine Contagious Ward," and its utility as such is only pending the arrangements for water supply and light. When these are completed a, very necessary adjunct to the Canine Hospital will have been laid down. Summary. 1928-29. 1929-30.

71 GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL. Department of Agriculture and Industries. Veterinary. CALCUTTA, THE 6TH NOVEMBER 1930. RESOLUTION12 subdivision has not been realised, the number (98) now employed being about half the ultimate strength of the staff. Similarly, the less ambitious scheme for the establishment of a veterinary hospital or dispensary in each subdivision is no nearer realisation. Nevertheless, it is gratifying to notice that a number of district boards have evinced interest in constructing or improving hospitals and dispensaries. Private assistance is also forthcoming to supplement the efforts of local bodies in this direction, and Government trust that this interest will be maintained. 4. The local bodies can do much to improve cattle by maintaining breeding bulls in larger number than at present. The existing number of 111 bulls maintained by them is inadequate, but if intensive work is taken up in selected local areas more valuable results can be expected. Castration of scrub and immature bulls is one of the means to this end, but it is reported that only 48 bulls were castrated during the year. This work should receive greater attention from the department. 5. The thanks of the Governor acting with the Minister-in-charge are due to Mr. Kerr for the care and attention which he devoted to the administration of the department. He also notices with pleasure the names of the officers of the department who did good work during the year.

Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Bengal, for the year 1930-31. Preface and General Administration. Mr. P. J. Kerr, I.V.S., continued to be in charge of the Department as Director and Veterinary Adviser to Government from the beginning of the year till the 26th March last, when he left for England on combined leave for six months and nineteen days. During his absence the duties of his post were split up and I acted as Director for the five days that were left of the last financial year. Mr. A. D. MacGregor, I.V.S., acted as Veterinary Adviser to Government from the 27th to the 31st March 1931, both days inclusive, in addition to his duties as Principal, Bengal Veterinary College. 2. During the period that Mr. Kerr remained in charge, he spent 52 days on tour and travelled 8,288 miles by rail, 87 miles by road and 104 miles by steamer. He visited Chinsura in the beginning of April to discuss with the Divisional Commissioner the proposal submitted by the District Board of Midnapore to reduce the number of Veterinary Assistant Surgeons from 7 to 3 in that district. It was pointed out by him that the present staff maintained by the Board was inadequate and any reduction in the number of posts was likely to lead to serious conse- quences, especially during outbreaks of cattle disease. The Board ultimately withdrew their proposal. In May he went to the Hills and inspected the hospitals and dispensaries at Darjeeling and Ghoom, and discussed with the Secretary to Government various important matters connected with this depart- ment. In June he visited Cooch-Behar and inspected the new Veterinary hospital buildings, which were then half complete, and suggested measures for the improvement and expansion of veterinary aid in that State. The meetings of the Advisory Board of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research were held during this month and he visited Simla and took part in the deliberations. He then visited Darjeeling again to attend on invitation the annual meeting of the D.H.S.P.C.A. In October he attended the Conference of the Chairmen of District Boards held at Darjeeling under the presidency of the Hon'ble Minister, and explained to the members present the position of Government in regard to veterinary work in this province. In November he visited Midnapore, inspected the hospital there, and discussed with the late Mr. Peddie a proposal for the introduction of serum simultaneous inoculation in that district. In December he visited the veterinary hospital at Rangpore and investigated, along with Mr. Cooper of the Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research at Muktesar, the cause of long-continued and unusual death of cattle from hæmorrhagic septicæmia on the Rangpur Farm. In January last he went to Delhi to attend the second meeting of the Advisory Board of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research, and then visited Baraset to act as a judge in the cattle show there. He then presided over a meeting in connection with the opening ceremony of the
6 new veterinary dispensary building at Dimla in Rangpur7 8. Maulvi M. S. Chaudhuri, Veterinary Inspector, who officiated as Assistant Director, Eastern Range, for nine months, visited Mymensingh, Tangail, Sarishabari, Comilla, Noakhali, Faridpur, Rajbari, Chittagong, Cox's Bazar, Barisal, and Pirojpur once each, and inspected the hospitals and dispensaries there. 9. In addition to the routine work of inspection he inspected the Jail and Municipal cattle, attended and investigated a serious outbreak of rinderpest at Burhatta in the district of Mymensingh and visited two villages in the interior of the Pirojpur subdivision in connection with a complaint against the Itinerant Veterinary Assistant Surgeon and cheeked the inoculation work done by him. He also attended the annual conference of the Central Co-operative Bank at Khepupara and the serum simultaneous inoculation undertaken at Manipur Farm during the year. 10, His tours covered a period of 64 days and he travelled 1,747 miles by rail, 258 miles by road and boat and 1,598 miles by steamer, 11, The only Veterinary Assistant Surgeon who was on foreign service in Iraq was Mr. N. P. Fernandez. He returned to duty in this province in August last. Part I.Equine Diseases. 17. Glanders.9 30. Inoculation was undertaken in 455 outbreaks and 89,088 animals were inoculated as against 142,761 animals protected in 704 outbreaks in the preceding year. Details of inoculation are as follows:10 86. Altogether 101 men worked in the mufassal, of whom 71 were purely Itinerant and the rest were either Stationary or Stationary and Itinerant, who worked in the mufassal when required to do so. In addition to the inoculation work noted in paragraph 30 of this report, these officers visited 16,729 Tillages and treated 186,957 cases as against 16,581 villages and 129,408 cases, respectively, in the preceding year. Some of these officers also visited cattle pounds and submitted reports to the District Boards regarding hygienic conditions and supply of food and water to the cattle impounded. Hospitals and Dispensaries. 37. Table V gives the details of the working of the hospitals and dispensaries in this province. 38. The number of such institutions during 1930-31 was 48 as against 46 in the year previous. This is due to the inclusion of the institutions at Dimla and Sodepur, which acquired considerable prominence during the year. 39. The number of in-and out-patients treated at hospitals and dispensaries during the year under report was 76,722 and 18,179 cases were supplied with medicines as against. 63,118 and 16,240 cases, respec - tively, in the previous year. The increase is an evidence of the fact that the usefulness of these institutions is being- gradually appreciated by the public. 40. It is reported that the District Board of Bogra have purchased a plot of 1½ bighas of land with a big tin-shed for the construction of dispensary with quarters for the Itinerant Veterinary Assistant Surgeon at -Jaipurhat. They have also budgeted a sum of Rs. 2.500 for building anew the hospital at the headquarters station of the district. 41. The District Board of Rangpur finished during the year the building work of the Veterinary Dispensary at Dimla, which was opened by the permanent Director, Mr. Kerr, in January, 1931. They were also good enough to construct a suitable bedroom in the quarters of the Stationary Veterinary Assistant Surgeon at Rangpur. 42. An operation shed was constructed by the District Board of Bankura in the Sadar Veterinary Hospital this year. 43. The work of construction of a Dog Ward attached to the Veterinary Hospital at Chinsura was taken up and finished in the course of this year. An allotment of Rs. 283 was sanctioned by Government to meet the extra expenditure incurred in this connection. 44. A scheme was submitted to the Dacca Municipality by the Assistant Director, Eastern Range (Maulvi M. S. Chaudhuri), for the remodelling of slaughter houses with a separate Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge. 45. Attempts were made to persuade the District Boards for the introduction of kelvinator for cold storage of sera where electric currents are available.

Annual Report of the Bengal Veterinary College, 1930-31. Preface and General Administration. Charge.36 6. Among these students (141), 3 were Graduates, 4 I.Sc. and 112 Matriculates. 7. Examinations.37 youths of such districts to enable them to prosecute their studies at this College and for subsequent employment at the new dispensaries when qualified. This year I have issued a circular in the form of an appeal to the Chairmen of all district and local boards in Bengal, inviting their special attention to this matter specifically. A copy of this circular is enclosed (Annexure I). 14. Additional Courses.38 22. Hostel.39 Anatomical Section. 30. As in preceding years, wet and dry specimens were prepared in large numbers to assist the boys in the study of this difficult subject (Anatomy) and also as permanent exhibits in the Dissection Theatre; one outstanding specimen depicting the entire urinary system of the horse, also a complete sagittal section, was made of a preserved horse, this being of great help in identifying the position and situation of various internal organs. 31. The spare wall space of the Dissection Theatre has been utilized for large-sized anatomical charts, showing various features of dissection in successive stages. These have been of considerable help to the students in comparing their actual dissections in the class, as well as for identification of the dissections of deeper structures. 32. Improved methods of dissection were also followed during the year to the immense benefit of the students. 33. Two skeletons40 not compelling owners to have their animals sent for treatment to this hospital. The number sent this year against the number of prosecu- tions forms sure proof of a misdirected policy in the prevention of cruelty to animals and the dwindling of this ratio with that of the previous year (16,395 prosecutions; 705 detentions) is still more evidence of a lost hope for these poor creatures in Calcutta. 38. The fees for treatment, etc., were Rs. 24,394, and the cost of feeding was Rs. 15,188 against Rs. 18,105 and Rs. 21,631, respectively, of previous year. The latter figure, namely cost, included the free treatment and upkeep of riding ponies, breeding and draft cattle belonging to the College and of free treatment of patients of poor people. The figures for the year 1930-31 are commendable, as great economy is being exercised by me and my staff in all directions, possibly at the expense of efficiency to some extent but not, I hope, sufficiently to do permanent harm. The increase of our income from fees is attributed in part to large arrear collections by the College Manager. 39. There is a well-equipped shoeing forge attached to the hospital where horses and cattle are shod with ordinary and surgical shoes. The fees from this source amounted to Rs. 52 only. This amount represents outside shoeing only and excludes hospital cases. 40. Ambulance.41 Extra Routine Activities. 45. (The Manager is in charge of this section.) 46.

Government was, therefore, approached, and they have administratively sanctioned the employment of three additional assistants; due to financial stringency, effect cannot be given to this important scheme at present. It would nevertheless be of advantage, however, to all factors concerned to have half the scheme given effect to, if not the whole. Special Remarks. 1. Vice-Principal.53 TABLE I.

63 ANNEXURE I. Circular No. 1, dated Belgachia, the 1st January 1931. From(3) A Post-graduate course of study is being started. (4) Hostel buildings are thoroughly equipped and well arranged under the supervision of the College Manager, who takes all possible interest in the students while here. (5) Most of the Bengal graduates now find employment throughout India, soon after their passing the final examination. (6) A short course, not exceeding four months, has been introduced and started as "Farriers and Dressers' Class." 4. I trust I have fully explained the justification of such an appeal, and I hope the Board, in their turn, will kindly consider the case favourably and provide some money in the next year's budget. 5.

CALCUTTA, THE 20th NOVEMBER 1931. RESOLUTION2 5. The Bengal Village Self-Government (Amendment) Act, 1931, which has been recently passed by the Legislative Council has removed the long-felt disability under which the union boards laboured due to their inability to undertake work for the prevention and treatment of cattle diseases or for the improvement of the breed and health of cattle. The union boards are a valuable agency for affording veterinary aid in the mufassal, and it is hoped that they will now take up the matter in right earnest, so far as their financial resources derived from the rate under section 37 (6) of the Act permit. 6. The Minister-in-charge notes with pleasure the names of the officers who did good work during the year and also desires to acknowledge the services rendered by Mr. Kerr.

Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Bengal, for the year 1931-32. Preface and General Administration. Khan Sahib Saiyed Sultan Ahmed, Bengal Higher Veterinary Service, officiated as Director of this Department from the beginning of the year till the 27th October last, when I returned from leave and took over charge. During my absence Mr. A. D. MacGregor, I.V.S., acted as Veterinary Adviser to Government in addition to his duties as Principal, Bengal Veterinary College. 2. During this period Mr. Ahmed was on tour for 41 days and travelled 2,840 miles by rail, 76 miles by road and 402 miles by boat and steamer. In the course of these tours he inspected the hospitals and dispensaries at Dacca, Narayanganj, Chittagong, Cox's Bazar, Noakhali, Darjeeling, Kurseong, Siliguri, Kalimpong, Jalpaiguri, Rangpur, Dinajpur, Malda, Berhampore, Krishnagar, Kharagpur, Burdwan, Diamond Harbour and Midnapore, and checked and supervised the work of the subordinate staff consulting with and advising local authorities as to the best means of improving veterinary matters in their respective districts. He also attended a meeting of the Provincial Agricultural Research Committee held at Dacca in April. 3. Mr. MacGregor as Veterinary Adviser spent 16 days on tour and travelled 2,724 miles by rail and 34 miles by road. He visited Simla to attend a meeting of the Advisory Board of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research and also Rangpur, where he held an enquiry into the unusual mortality of cattle on the Rangpur Farm. 4. After my return from England I undertook such tours only as were absolutely necessary. In pursuance of this policy I visited Cooch Behar in the beginning of November last and impressed upon the Vice- President, Regency Council, the desirability of retaining a separate officer for the hospital at Cooch Behar, which they had constructed and equipped. It was decided that the post be kept in abeyance and the two Itinerant Veterinary Assistant Surgeons be stationed at headquarters until financial conditions improved. In the same month I visited Ber- hampore and discussed with the Chairman, District Board, the necessity of retaining in full the veterinary staff, a portion of which he had requested to be withdrawn owing to the inability of the Board to meet the cost of contribution payable to Government. The importance of this staff in relation to agriculture was pointed out to him and the posts retained. The opening ceremony of the dog ward attached to the Veteri- nary Hospital at Chinsura was held on the 28th of November last under the presidency of Mr. G. P. Hogg, I.C.S., Commissioner of the Burdwar Division, and I attended the function. 5. In December I visited Dacca to investigate an outbreak of hæmorrhagic septicæmia and arranged for experimental "Virus alone" inoculation of 30 hired cattle at Manipur Farm. In January I visited
6 Chuadanga and delivered lectures on the care and management of cattle with the aid of the departmental cinema. The second meeting of the Advisory Board of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research was held at Delhi in the last week of January which I attended as a represen- tative of the Bengal Veterinary Department. 6. In February I visited Dacca for the second time and investigated with Col. Olver, Animal Husbandry Expert of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research, and Mr. Ware, the Director of the Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research at Muktesar, the causes of outbreak of cattle disease there. They also saw the result of the "Virus alone" inoculation and the immunity test of 4 cattle inoculated 12 months pre- viously. A demonstration of inoculation against rinderpest by the serum simultaneous method was given at Kapilmuni in the district of Khulna in the last week of this month and I attended this demonstration half of the cost of which was borne by the district board, the other half being met by Rai Sahib Binode Behari Sadhu of this district, to whom the thanks of Government are due for his public-spirited action in coming- forward with funds for this demonstration. 7. The annual examinations of the Bengal Veterinary College were held in March and I attended the examinations as President of the Board of Examiners. 8. My tours covered a period of 37 days and I travelled 4,238 miles by rail, 64 miles by road and 378 miles by steamer. 9. Two officers held charge of the Western Range during the year, Assistant Directors Rai Sahibs Sarat Chandra Paul and Nripendra Nath Majumdar. The former was on leave from the beginning of the year till the 2nd June 1931 and returned to work for only 28 days, after which he retired from the service of Government. He made no tours during the period he was in charge. 10. With the exception of the brief period of 33 days during which he was on leave on average pay Rai Sahib Nripendra Nath Majumdar was in charge of the Western Range throughout the year. He toured for 38 days and visited Cooch Behar, Darjeeling, Ghoom, Kurseong, Siliguri, Jangipur, Chinsura, Khulna and Dacca, travelling altogether 2,250 miles by rail, 48 miles by road and 274 miles by steamer. 11. Besides carrying on the routine work of inspection in the Western Range, the Rai Sahib visited the jails in Calcutta several times in con- nection with the Hormone Experiment in barren cows, which I com- menced in January, and which judged by the success so far achieved, may lead to most important results. From 29th January to 10th February 1932, he conducted at Dacca under my instructions an inoculation experiment by the "goat-virus- alone-method," which, if successful, will greatly reduce the cost for anti- rinderpest inoculation. He also took charge of the serum simultaneous inoculation demonstration held at Kapilmuni in the district of Khulna, where 445 animals were protected against rinderpest with satisfactory results. 12. Maulvi Mahamed Sanowar Chowdhury, officiating Assistant Director, was on duty in the Eastern Range throughout the year under report. He was on tour for 73 days and visited Chittagong, Mymensingh,
7 Jamalpur, Bhola, Patuakhali, Rajbari once each and Barisal and Comilla twice and came to Calcutta twice covering altogether 1,110 miles by rail, 1,195 miles by steamer and 380 miles by road and boat. During these tours he inspected the work of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons, visited jail and municipal cattle and interviewed the local authorities regarding the expansion of veterinary staff in the districts. He also attended and investigated two outbreaks of hæmorrhagic septicæmia and anthrax in the Manipur Farm and Dacca Central Jail, respectively, and look prompt steps to stamp out the diseases by protective inoculation. 13. In addition to the above work he conducted serum simultaneous inoculation of the Dairy cattle at Manipur against rinderpest and was present at the experimental inoculation by "goat-virus-method-alone." The travelling allowance of both these officers has been so much reduced that a great deal of necessary inspection work and visiting seats of large outbreaks has had to be curtailed to the detriment of the work of the department.

Each Veterinary Assistant Surgeon is supplied with a pamphlet on Animal Husbandly and carries on propaganda on this subject in addition to his veterinary duties. Hospitals and Dispensaries. 38. Table V shows the number of animals treated and castrated at various hospitals and dispensaries in this province during the year under report. 39. The number of such institutions in 1930-31 was 48. No new hospital or dispensary was opened during the year. 40. The total number of patients treated at these institutions was 78,455 as against 76,722 in the year previous. Of these, 13,907 were in and 64,548 were out-patients. In addition to the above 17,258 cases were supplied with medicines as against 18,179 in the preceding year. 41. It is reported that the district board of Noakhali have allotted a sum of Rs. 500 in their budget for 1932-33 for the construction of a dispensary with quarters for the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon at Hatiya. 42. The district board of Tippera have selected a site for the cons- truction of a dispensary with quarters for the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon at Chandpur and have ordered the dispensary to be removed to a better site in the town for the present. 43. Some improvements in the quarters of the Itinerant Veterinary Assistant Surgeon at Mymensingh Sadar were effected by the board during the year. It is hoped that other district boards will realise the need for providing the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons with suitable quarters as it is a great stimulus to their efficiency. Few boards have as yet realised this and acted upon it. 44. The district board of Bakarganj have acquired an additional plot of 3 bighas of land for the Veterinary Hospital at Barisal. 45. A sum of Rs. 145 was collected by a committee in Chittagong and awarded to the Veterinary Hospital there for the improvement of the dog kennels and installation of electricity in the hospital, provided the recurring expenses were undertaken by the board. A sum of Rs. 95-10 was also realised as subscription from the local gentry towards the cost of construction of an additional room for dog operation theatre in the hospital. 46. One cross montgomery bull calf was presented to the Veterinary Hospital at Barisal by Mr. B. B. Guha, a local zemindar. 47. The shed for out-patients at Cox's Bazar was converted into a Veterinary Dispensary. At Rangamati, Chittagong Hill Tracts, pending the construction of a dispensary with quarters on the site acquired, the quarters for a minis- terial officer have been permitted to be used as a dispensary by the Deputy Commissioner. 48. Provision has been made by the district board of Faridpur for the construction of a dispensary at Madaripur during the current financial year.
11 Part III.12 the spot. Both these diseases are under investigation by the Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research. The appointment of such an officer is now under the consideration of Government. 56. Dacca Farm.13 cattle improvement. I would indicate a possible source of revenue, which being derived from cattle might legitimately be applied to the advancement of animal husbandry, viz., a poll tax on all cattle sold at the melas and cattle fairs in Bengal. It is estimated that 2 lakhs of cattle are sold annually at these fairs and at 8 annas per head the lakh collected would provide 25 extra staff assistants needed to control conta- gious disease, and leave half a lakh to provide more live-stock officers and premium bulls. This sum would make little appreciable difference to the deficit in provincial revenues, but would be sufficient to confer enormous benefit to the cattle owners of Bengal. 64. Serum Simultaneous Inoculation.14 on Government Farm cattle in collaboration with the Live-Stock Expert. These experiments are being continued and fortunately do not depend on the provision of additional funds. 67. Assistant Directors.15 absences on account of ill health have been unavoidable, the difficulties- of the office as a whole being increased thereby. I wish to place on record that all members of the Civil Veterinary Department staff have worked loyally throughout the year and that there has been no noticeable reduction in their efforts under the 10 per cent. cut in salaries. For officers on salaries under Rs. 100 per month this cut entails greater hardship than upon those on higher rates and I hope Government may be able to grant relief to these officers at all events, at no very distant date. I wish to record my appreciation of the work of Babu K. K. Banerjee, Laboratory Assistant in charge of the Serum Store. The issue of sera, etc., has been carried out in a most satisfactory manner. P.

Annual Report of the Bengal Veterinary College 1931-32. Preface and General Administration. Charge.40 6. The detailed origin of the students for the current session was as follows:41 Lecturers in Hygiene, Veterinary Medicine and Veterinary Surgery each require an Assistant Lecturer, or the standard of teaching is likely to be seriously impaired." 11. Government decided to take no action on it until a formal proposal on the subject was submitted by me. 12. Stipends.42 Museum and Library. 22. Maulvi Md. Jamsheduddin was in charge of both Museum and Library. 23. Museum.43 31. As in previous years, preservative methods enabled dissections to be kept going right through the term to the decided advantage of the students. 32. Four fresh sets of bones44 General Remarks. 43. (a) The Committee of Management held two meetings during the year and discussed important matters connected with the College. (b) The revision of the rules of the College is still under the consideration of Government. (c) During the year under report, Khan Sahib S. S. Ahmed (Vice- Principal) was on leave from 28th October 1931 till 13th March 1932 and Babu Debendra Kumar Sen (Lecturer) from 16th December 1931 to 16th February 1932. (d) Government have sanctioned the proposal of the Board of Examiners for 1930-31 suggesting 45 per cent. pass for each subject in the three classes. (e) The Principal and Babu Debendra Kumar Sen (Lecturer) were appointed by the Bihar and Orissa Government as President and Examiner, respectively, of the Board of Examinations of the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary College, Patna, during 1931-32. (f) Through the energy and public spirit of the Honorary Secretary of the Health Association of this Ward No. XXX (the College Manager), a Health Exhibition and a Cattle Show are held annually within the compound of this College with sanction of Government. The Exhibition of various veterinary models and the Cattle Show prove of invaluable help to the public. (g) Although financial stringency has prevailed throughout the year, I am glad to mention here that this institution is not materially affected by it. We have been able to credit Government with extra revenues, as per details given, from our extra routine activities and to maintain the efficiency of the College and Hospital on much less expenditure.

Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Bengal, for the year 1932-33. Preface and General Administration. Charge.6 11. Rai Sahib Nripendra Nath Majumdar worked as Assistant Director, Western Range, throughout the year. He spent 19 days on tour and travelled 1,746 miles by rail and 66 miles by road. He visited Rangpur, Natore, Siliguri, Kalimpong and Krishnagar and checked and supervised the work of the subordinate staff. He also attended the selection of site for the Veterinary Dispensary at Siliguri and undertook serum simultaneous inoculation against rinderpest of the municipal cattle at Nabadwip and of the animals belonging to the Railway Cantonment Dairy Farm at Kharagpur. The operation in both cases was successful and altogether 59 head of cattle (includ- ing buffaloes) were protected by this method without any fatality. He also assisted me in my work at headquarters. 12. Maulvi Muhammad Sanowar Chowdhuri, Assistant Director, held charge of the Eastern Range, throughout the year. He toured for 64 days and travelled 1,552 miles by rail, 56 miles by road and 1,007 miles by steamer and country boat. He inspected the hospitals and dispensaries at Mymensingh, Sarishabari, Jamalpur, Barisal, Faridpur, Rajbari, Chittagong, Noakhali, Comilla, Brahmanberia, Chandpur, Narainganj and Munshiganj, visited the jail and municipal cattle and impressed upon the local authorities the necessity of employing more veterinary men in the districts. He also accompanied me to Jaidebpur in connection with the creation of a new post under the Bhawal Wards Estate. 13. In March 1933 he conducted serum simultaneous and experi- mental inoculations of cattle in the Manipur Government Dairy Farm, and also immunised 46 animals by serum simultaneous method. Five Scindhi yearlings were protected with goat virus alone. These animals were born of immune dams. None showed any serious reaction to the virus, the potency of which was assured by the reaction in goats. One animal, which was protected by goat virus alone in 1931, was tested with bull virus to ascertain the power of immunity acquired in the previous inoculation and proved immune. An experiment on goat virus production was carried out by him in the Government Hospital at Dacca in order to ascertain the suitability and potency of the virus for use in the field. It was found that further apparatus is necessary for the production of a satisfactory virus. 14. He also delivered a lecture in Bengali on the improvement of cattle breeding and control of epizootics, etc., in the conference of the presidents of union boards opened by His Excellency the Governor of Bengal in July 1932. 15. The tours of both the Assistant Directors had to be restricted as money under head "Travelling allowance" had to be re-appropriated on account of shortage of funds in the budget. 16. The scheme for the appointment of a Veterinary Disease Investigation Officer in Bengal was sanctioned and given effect to in December last and the services of Mr. M. B. Menon, Assistant Veterinary Research Officer, Muktesar, were placed at the disposal of this department to commence work under the scheme pending the reversion of Mr. S. C. A. Datta to this province. Mr. Menon took up his duties on the forenoon of the 15th December last and spent a week at headquarters in organising his office and in equipping his laboratory room, which had been allotted to him at the Bengal
7 Veterinary College at Belgachia. One clerk and a peon were also appointed for him. 17. The first investigation which Mr. Menon was called upon to make was in connection with an outbreak of equine influenza at Bilmaria in the Rajshahi district. 18. The high mortality of calves on the Rangpur Farm was the next thing taken up by him for investigation. He visited Rangpur and studied the problem closely on the spot. His work was inter- rupted as he was unfortunately compelled to go on leave for 26 days with effect from the 28th February last, owing to the serious illness of his wife. A quantity of material has, however, been collected by him and work is being carried on. 19. Animals of a local dairy farm were also submitted by him to double intra-dermal tuberculin test for detecting infection either with tuberculosis or Jhone's disease and a few showed reaction. It is contemplated to take up this work on a larger scale during the coming year, to ascertain the prevalence of these diseases in Bengal. 20. His tours covered a period of 18 days and he travelled 425 miles by rail and 6 miles by road. Part I.8 mortality was the highest on record during the last triennium due to extensive outbreaks of rinderpest. Equine Diseases. 25. Glanders.9 septicæmia in cats, fowl cholera and other avian diseases. The total loss under this head was 3,638 as against 768 in the previous year. Of this number 1,696 deaths were reported as fowl cholera and 1,736 hæmorrhagic septicæmia in eats. Table III.10 outbreaks. Besides doing the inoculation work referred to in para- graph 37 of this report these officers visited 16,587 villages and treated 175, 228 cases as against 16, 922 villages and 127, 347 cases, respec- tively, in the preceding year. 44. Of the large number of patients treated this year as many as 73,303 were brought to the headquarters of the Itinerant Veterinary Assistant Surgeons for treatment. This indicates that in some places at least there is a pressing necessity for the establishment of regular dispensaries for rendering help to the ryots and it is hoped local bodies will realise their responsibility in this direction and work up to the programme of a dispensary in each district and subdivisional headquarters with a Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge. Hospitals and Dispensaries. 45. Table V shows the working of the hospitals and dispensaries in this province during the year. 46. A new dispensary was opened at Jaidebpur during the year, thus bringing the total number of such institutions to 49 as against 48 in the preceding year. 47. The number of in- and out-patients treated at these dispen- saries was 81,255 and 19,727 cases were supplied with medicines as against 78, 455 and 17, 258 cases, respectively, in the previous year. The increase is an evidence of the fact that the usefulness of these institutions is being widely appreciated by the public. 48. The Mymensingh Veterinary Hospital has been provided with electric connection at a cost of Rs. 200 as a preliminary step for the installation of a "Kelvinator" for the cold storage of serum. It is expected that a Kelvinator will be installed in the current year. 49. An acre of land has been awarded by Government to the District Board of Mymensingh in each of the subdivisions of Jamalpore and Kishoreganj for the construction of veterinary dispensaries in those places. The proposal has been sent up to Government for notification. 50. The Government Veterinary Hospital at Dacca was provided with filtered water connection at a cost of Rs. 920 during the year. 51. The Dacca Municipality provided a compound wall and a pucca drain in the goat slaughter house during the year. 52. The District Board of Noakhali have allotted a sum of Rs. 2,500 for the construction of the veterinary dispensary at Hatiya, and the work is reported to have been taken up at the latter part of the year. 53. The proposal for the acquisition of the land selected for the veterinary dispensary at Chandpur has gone up to Government for sanction. 54. The dispensary at Madaripur in the district of Faridpur was constructed and opened during the year. 55. The Chittagong Veterinary Hospital has been provided with electric connection, cost met from the dog show fund and a sum of
11 Rs. 1,000 has been allotted by the district board for the installation of a Kelvinator. A further sum of Rs. 130 has been collected for the construction of a dog operation shed and for the extension of the dog kennel but as the amount is inadequate it has been kept in deposit in the bank pending receipt of further subscriptions for the purpose. Thanks are due to Mrs. E. Nolan, Secretary, and the members of the Dog Show Committee for the keen interest taken in the veterinary hospital and generous financial help which has resulted in the erection of a dog operating theatre and the installation of electric light. 56. The District Board of Chittagong has also sanctioned the construction of the veterinary dispensary at Satkania and the work is now in hand. 57. The District Board of Malda constructed during the year a building for the veterinary stores at Nawabganj with quarters for the Itinerant Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge. 58. The District Board of Bogra similarly constructed during the year a building for the veterinary stores at Joypurhat with quarters for the Itinerant Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge. Part III.12 cattle. The possibilities of this proposal are now being examined by Government. Bull Breeding and Rearing Farms. 64. Three such farms were at work in this province during the year, one at Kalimpong, another at Rangpur and the third at Manipur, Dacca. The first is the property of St. Andrews Colonial Homes and the other two of Government. (Table IX, which is intended to show the working of these farms, is left blank, vide report to Live-stock Expert in the annual report of the Director of Agriculture.) 65. Rangpur.13 Chairman, District Board, in which a proportion of the cost is borne by the union boards. Steps have since been taken at the instance of the chairman to move Government to provide funds for these new posts in the budget of this department for the current financial year. 71. Babu R. N. Maitra, Itinerant Veterinary Assistant Surgeon of Asansol in the district of Burdwan, died in July 1932 and Govern- ment were pleased to sanction the grant of a compassionate gratuity of Rs. 8 per month to his widow Srimati Tarubala Debya for a period of three years with, effect from the date of issue of their order. Babu A. T. Roy, Itinerant Veterinary Assistant Surgeon of Perojpore in the district of Bakarganj, was placed on deputation on foreign service for a period of three years with effect from the 15th September 1932 for employment as Veterinary Assistant Surgeon under the Bhawal Estate under the Court of Wards. Moulvi S. M. Muhammadul Haque, Itinerant Veterinary Assistant Surgeon of Faridpur, was pro- moted to act as Inspector in the vacancy arising from the death of Babu Shibdas Bhaduri, Glanders Inspector, Bengal Veterinary College. General Remarks. 72. Rinderpest.14 District Officers to overcome the delay now unavoidable in obtaining initial supplies from Muktesar, Such a station should not entail any large capital outlay and the recurrent cost, if run on lines similar to those employed in Madras, should not be more than Rs. 6,000 to Rs. 7,000 approximately. During my deputation to Muktesar I went into the matter of serum manufacture very carefully and spent several days at the Serum Institute at Izatnagar. I came to the conclusion that the preparation of serum provincially would not be financially sound in Bengal, especially in view of the reduction of the cost of serum supplied by Muktesar to one anna and six pies per unit dose. 74. Hæmaturia.15 be hæmorrhagic septicæmia of cats. No outbreaks of hæmorrhagic septicæmia of other animals or fowls were known to have prevailed in the localities recently, or at the time of the outbreak among cats. The Public Health Officers reported the disease to us fearing it might have relation to plague. No cases of plague among human beings were detected during these outbreaks or subsequent to them. 76.
