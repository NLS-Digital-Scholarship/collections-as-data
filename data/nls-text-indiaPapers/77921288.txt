REPORT ON DISPENSARIES AND LUNATIC ASYLUM IN THE PROVINCE OF OUDH FOR THE YEAR 1869. LUCKNOW :--Printed at the OUDH GOVERNMENT PRESS.
No. 4. FROM THE DEPUTY INSPECTOR GENERAL OF HOSPITALS, LUCKNOW CIRCLE, TO THE OFFG. SECY. TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, OUDH. Dated Lucknow, the 30th March 1870. SIR, I have the honour to forward for submission to the Chief Com- missioner, my Annual Report of Inspection of the Dispensaries of this Province for the year 1869. 2.The numbers attending and relieved by the dispensaries are given for the year under review and for the previous year. It appears that in the year 1868, 96,307 persons availed themselves of the advantages of the Government dispensaries in the province ; and that the numbers similarly presenting themselves in 1869, were, as regards the same number of dispensaries, 87,568. 3.In addition to the latter number there was an attendance of 2,555, at the Shahabád branch dispensary, opened during the past year, and not existing in 1868. The aggregate cost of all the dispensaries in Oudh, Shahabád branch included, was, for 1869,Annual Inspection Report of the Dispensaries in Oudh for the year 1869. KING'S HOSPITAL. I inspected this fine institution on 14th February and found it main- taining its extensive popularity and utility under Dr. Cannon's able manage- ment with the efficient assistance of his skilful and deserving Sub-Assist- ant Surgeon. The hospital was in full work, medical and surgical, with a fair proportion of operations, all doing well. There were 28 in-door patients and the out-door attendance was 129 on this date. The building and out offices were in excellent condition as were also the books, records, medicines, and surgical instruments; and I was well pleased with the entire results of my inspection. The following is the annual working of the institution : Remaining under treatment on 1st January 1869, 250 In-door patients admitted, ... ... 431 Outdoor patients admitted, ... ... 9,980 Total, ... 10,661 In 1868, ... 11,700 Cured and relieved, ... ... ... 9,257 Ceased to attend or no better, ... ... 1,173 Died, ... ... ... ... 76 Remaining, ... ... ... ... 155 Total, ... 10,661 Daily average attendance in-door, ... ... 28.44 Ditto out-door, ... ... 130.89 Total, ... 159.33 Surgical operations.

( 2 ) 3rd grade Sub-Assistant Surgeon Nobin Chander Mitr is most highly reported of by Dr. Cannon, and justly so in my opinion. HAZRATGANJ DISPENSARY. I inspected this dispensary on the 14th February and was sorry to find that still, by some budget mistake involving stoppage of funds, its in-door working and utility had almost entirely ceased, there being only three cases in hospital. The out-door attendance, however, was satisfac- tory, 154 cases on the day of my inspection. The building was in good order, as were also the books, records, medicines, and instruments.

Native Doctor Dídár Baksh is a careful and skilful dispenser of medicines, and a good medical practitioner.
( 3 ) ONAO DISPENSARY. I visited and inspected this dispensary on the 14th December and was much pleased with Dr. Hart's revival of the institution as com- pared with the state in which I found it on my last annual inspection. Several surgical operations had been skilfully performed with successful results, and there was an air of work and attention in the wards which contained 10 patients. In many of the accessaries, however, such as the cots, bedding, and other minor details, the dispensary was sadly want- ing from past neglect, but from no fault of Dr. Hart's who had been but a very short time in charge and had worked zealously and well. As I now write, in February, all deficiencies have been made good by Assis- tant Surgeon Franklin from whose assiduity and intelligence I expect a prosperous future for this dispensary. The following is the annual working of the institution.

( 4 ) 2nd class Native Doctor Mahammed Baksh is reported by the medical officer as very intelligent and attentive to his duties. He speaks and writes English very well. SEETAPOOR DISPEN SARY. I visited and inspected this dispensary on the 19th of November, meeting Assistant Surgeon Cameron, in charge, by appointment. I was displeased with the dispensary as a whole, and it gave me at once the im- pression that it was negligently and carelessly looked after; the medical officer, amongst other things, not being apparently familiar with the cases as we came up to the beds; and the Sub-Assistant Surgeon also showing little readiness in this and other matters. There were 16 cases in the wards; but the out-door attendance for the day, also 16 cases, does not in my opinion speak well for the popularity and utility of the institution. The books and records were well kept, and the instruments and medicines in good order. More than two days after the above inspection I again, just before leaving Seetapoor for Hurdui, visited the dispensary, and found my im- pressions as above described fully justified and confirmed.

MOHAMDABÁD BRANCH DISPENSARY. The annual working of this dispensary &c. is given as follows :( 6 ) and the whole institution had collapsed, and almost become extinct. There were three wretched in-door patients sitting on the ground, and no out-door attendance worth speaking of. In fact the dispensary had become a disgrace to Government. The books and records were badly kept ; but showed that no operations had been performed during the year. The surgical instruments were in good order. No wonder. In January I had a personal interview with Colonel Thompson, Commissioner of Seetapoor, and besought his kind aid and influence in re-establishing and revitalising this dispensary ; and from his promises, and the exertions of the new medical officer Assistant Surgeon Galloway, I hope for a more cheering report of this dispensary next year.

His conduct is good, and his professional qualifications satisfactory. HURDUI DISPENSARY. I inspected this dispensary on 22nd November and found it, as is every thing under Dr. McReddie's care and management, in excellent order and work, and I was much pleased. There were only seven cases in hospital, but of these three were surgical, and progressing favorably. The books, records, medicines and instruments, were all in order and good condition, and the utility and popularity of this well managed dis- pensary were everywhere obvious.

NAWABGANJ DISPEN- SARY. I inspected this dispensary on 18th January, and was impressed with the conviction that its working and utility are much more restricted than they ought to be, and would be under active and zealous management, surgical operations at the rate of one a month, throughout the year, shew, in my opinion, that the dispensary has no great reputation in the district, and the institution had, when I visited it, more the air of a bazár house than of a working hospital. The building and its accessories are all that can be desired, and it is to be regretted that the hospital is not worked up to its capabilities. There were ten patients in the hospital ; no surgical operations. The books, medicines, and instrument were in good order. The following shows the annual working of the institution.

Every
( 14 ) thing was, however, ready for any call or emergency. The books, re- cords, instruments and medicines, were all in unexceptionable regularity and condition.

I visited this dispensary on the 22nd January, and was pleased with its general condition and working. There were eleven cases in hospital, amongst them some surgical cases of importance which had been operat- ed upon, showing that the hospital was working and popular. I also
( 15 ) witnessed the very numerous out-door attendance of a morning, con- firming this opinion. The dispensary and out-buildings are in excellent order ; and the books, records, instruments and medicines correct and in good condition. The dispensary possesses the confidence of the people, and deserves it. The following is the annual working of the institution :( 16 ) ATRAULA BRANCH DISPENSARY.

BARAICH DISPENSARY. I inspected this dispensary on 23rd January, and was gratified be- yond expression by the pleasing contrast in its condition, as compared with the wretched state in which I found it, and reported it, last year. Dr. Logg's zeal, energy, and skill, have revived it ; and it is now a blessing to the district. There were ten patients in hospital, well cared for and looked after; and the working aspect of affairs was most cheering. The books, records, instruments, and medicines were all as they ought to be. Great praise is due to Dr. Logg, and to the Sub-Assistant Surgeon, with whom last year, under a very deficient stamp of superior, I was so dis- satisfied.

LUCKNOW : D. O'CALLAGHAN, 21st May 1870. Deputy Inspector General of Hospitals, Lucknow Circle. LUCKNOW:-PRINTED AT THE OUDH GOVERNMENT PRESS.
No. 2847. FROM H. B. HARINGTON, ESQ., M. A., Offg. Secy. to the Chief Commissioner, Oudh, TO THE DEPUTY INSPECTOR GENERAL OF HOSPITALS. Indian Medical Department. Dated Lucknow, the 11th June 1870. SIR, In acknowledging the receipt of your report on the Dispensaries for 1869, I am directed to state that your omission to comply with the Chief Commissioner's instruction to exhibit the figures of two years in juxta-position has imposed on him needless trouble, which he trusts you will spare him in future. 2. You explain the decreased attendance by the healthiness of the year, the increased expense by the dearness of food. The Chief Com- missioner sees no cause to dispute these conclusions, and it is satisfac - tory that a year of dearth has not proved one of sickness. 3. Lacknow.( 2 ) Golah.( 3 ) pensaries are, the Chief Commissioner regrets to observe, much worse supported than last year. 7. The best thanks of the Chief Commissioner are due to the expe- rienced Civil Surgeons who have supervised the dispensaries to your satisfaction. Doctors Logg and Hart have the credit of restoring the Baraich and Oonao dispensaries to an efficient state. 8. Your favourable notice of the undermentioned native medical officers and subordinates is approved. Sub-Assistant Surgeons.REPORT ON DISPENSARIES AND LUNATIC ASYLUM IN THE PROVINCE OF OUDH FOR THE YEAR 1870. LUCKNOW :Annual Inspection Report of the Dispensaries in Oudh for the year 1870. KING'S HOSPITAL. I visited and inspected this Hospital on the 20th December 1870, on which date there were 29 in-door and 171 out-door patients. The Hospital is in every way suitable for the sick, and the sanitary condition of the buildings and neighbourhood is in every way satisfactory. Dry earth sanitation is punctually carried out. The Books and Records were well kept and the Medicines and Surgical Instruments in good order and serviceable. The following is the annual working of the institution :( 2 ) 3rd Grade Sub-Assistant Surgeon Nobin Chunder Mitr's conduct and qualifications are highly reported on by the Civil Surgeon. HAZRATGANJ DISPENSARY. I visited this Dispensary on 20th December 1870. The building was very clean and everything well arranged. The Medical Stores were good in quality and sufficient. The instruments complete. The Books and Records, &c., were written up and well kept. At the time of my visit there were 146 out-door and 17 in-door patients, none of a serious nature. The building is not, in my opinion well adapted for the treatment of in- door patients, the ground being low and the drainage bad. The following are the annual statistics of the institution :( 3 ) The conduct and qualifications of 1st Class Hospital Assistant Dí- dár Baksh are good. OONAO DISPENSARY. I visited the Dispensary at Oonao on the 29th December 1870. I have every reason to be satisfied with the zeal and ability of the Medical Officer Doctor Cromarty; the order and cleanliness of the institution reflects credit on his management. The medical stores were good and sufficient. The Books, Returns, &c., were written up and well kept, and the Instruments were in good order and serviceable. The following are the statistics of the Institution for the year :( 4 ) SEETAPOOR DISPENSARY. I visited the Dispensary at Seetapoor on the 7th December 1870 then in charge of Dr. A. Cameron, who has since been transferred to the Civil Station of Fyzabad. I have had no opportunity of judging of Dr. Cameron's qualifications, but I have the pleasure to state that I found everything quite satisfactory. The Instruments, Books and Records, were in good order. By the aid of special subscriptions a large supply of excellent bedding was procured and several improvements effected, the monthly subscriptions were increased from a very small amount to nearly 300 Rs. during the year. On the date of my visit the out-door attendance was 20, and there were 10 in-door patients under treatment, including amputation at the shoulder joint, lithotomy, compound fracture of both bones of leg, and fracture of the base of the skull. No epidemic disease occurred during the year. The following are the statistics of the institution for 1869, and 1870. 1869. 1870.

Since his appointment there has been a considerable increase in the number of out patients. MOHAMDABAD BRANCH DISPENSARY. The comparative statistics of this Dispensary for the years 1869 and 1870 are as follows :( 6 ) formed, and also in the number of out-door patients during the year, and altogether the working of the dispensary appears to me satisfactory. During the rains the hospital building for the male patients fell down, and the sick had to be removed to the female hospital. The number of in-door patients admitted during the latter part of the year has been small in consequence of the insufficient accommodation.

The Dispensary has been placed in visiting charge of Dr. J. Cameron. The working of the institution shews an improvement as compared with last year in the number of out-door patients treated, but fewer operations have been performed. The Dispensary is well elevated and drained, and dry earth sanitation is properly carried out. The cooking houses are in good condition, the beds, clothing and all Hospital necessaries are efficient. The Euro- pean medicines are of good quality, but there is a difficulty in obtaining good country medicines. Instruments are complete but requiring repairs.

From the slight opportunity I have had of judg- ing of Mr. Seaman's work, I am of opinion that he is an intelligent and energetic officer. I visited the Dispensary on the 30th of November and found the medicines, both European and Native, of good quality and well kept. The instruments were in good order, but some required repairs, the books were up to date. The following is the annual working of the institution:( 16 ) Sub-Assistant Surgeon Gresh Chunder Mitter is of the 3rd grade, and is very favorably reported of by the Civil Surgeon, his conduct and qualifica- tions being very good, and his zeal and intelligence of a high order. GONDAH DISPENSARY. I visited this Dispensary on the 1st December and was satisfied with its general working. It is in charge of Dr. Higginson. The heavy rains of August last did great injury to the buildings which are now undergoing thorough repair, the patients being temporarily located in an adjoining build- ing. I found the medical stores of good quality and sufficient, the poisons kept separate and locked up.

It is in medical charge of Dr. J. Hart. I found the institution in full practice, and was much gratified with the entire working, its popularity and utility. The buildings have suffered greatly from the heavy rains of the past season, a portion of the roof having fallen down. Repairs have been ordered, but as the building is totally inadequate to the requirements of the Hospital, it is to be hoped that the Settlement cutcherry may be given over for this purpose, when vacated in May next. It is in every way adopted for the purposes required. The books, records, medicines, and surgical instruments, were all in good order.

The Medical Officer in charge, Dr. Charles Cameron, was transferred to Lucknow, on 25th May, as Superintendent of Central Jail, Dr. H. Beath of the British Medical Department being appointed temporarily. On the departure of Dr. Beath with his Regiment on 23rd November, Sub-Assistant Surgeon Nim Chand Gooptoo, was left in charge. The Books were not kept so regularly as I could desire, but this I ascribe in great measure to the frequent changes which have taken place. The instruments and medi- cines were in good and serviceable order, and the poisons segregated. The following is the annual working of the institution:( 22 ) 1869. 1870.

No. 3991A. FROM H. B. HARINGTON, ESQUIRE, M. A., OFFG. SECY. TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, OUDH. TO C. ARCHER, ESQUIRE, M. D., DEPUTY INSPECTOR GENERAL OF HOSPITALS, INDIAN MEDICAL SERVICE, LUCKNOW CIRCLE. Dated Lucknow, the 28th August 1871. General. SIR, Dispensary Report. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your report on the Dispensaries and Lunatic Asylum of the Province for the year 1870; and to communicate the following remarks :( 2 ) If these figures be correct, an explanation should be given. Mahmudabad Branch. 7. On the general state of this dispensary you make no comment. The statistics show a falling off in attendance, whilst surgical operations, all minor, only amounted to four. Lakhimpúr. 8. The Commissioner of Seetapoor will be requested to see that the building is thoroughly repaired. The rise in the number of out-door patients from 1,885 to 2,670 ; of the daily average attendance from 23.37 to 36.75 ; of cured and relieved from 1,980 to 2,681; and of surgical operations from 182 to 269 is all satisfactory. Native subscriptions, too, which fell in 1869 from Rs. 1,203 to Rs. 882, have again risen to Rs. 1,114. Mohamdí Branch. 9. There are only statistics to judge by; and these are much the same as those of 1869. Golah Branch. 10. The same may be said of this branch dispensary ; but there is a decided falling off in patients and in the numbers cured and relieved. Minor operations rose from 216 to 314. The professional qualifications of the officer in charge are said to be indifferent, and are the probable cause of the unsatisfactory results. I am to request that you will show cause why he should not be removed and a more efficient officer sent in his place. Hurdui. 11. The native subscriptions are liberal. The number of patients rose from 1,736 to 2,421; and of cured and relieved from 1,455 to 1,996. Of capital operations there were thirty, and you found the dispensary in ex- cellent order, well managed, and popular. Sandílá Branch. 12. The number of patients (3,783), and of cured and relieved (3,389), stamp the usefulness of this institution. The fact that native subscrip- tions have been wholly discontinued, while last year they amounted to Rs. 395, would seem to require explanation. Sháhabád Branch. 13. The statistics are much the same as those of 1869, in April of which year this branch was opened. Bilgrám Branch. 14. Although opened only in August 1870, this branch relieved 3,085 patients, of whom 2,028 were cured and relieved; the daily average out-door attendance was 77.45 ; but of operations there were only two. Barabunkee 15. The liberality of native subscriptions, which have risen from Rs. 3,485 to 4,281, is cordially acknowledged by the Officiating Chief Commissioner. The dispensary was in excellent order, and, with the exception of a fall in surgical operations, the statistics are satisfactory. The daily cost of dieting each in-door patient is extremely small. Ramnagar Branch. 16. The figures show an improvement in attendance and relief, but of surgical operations there was not one. Ramsanan Branch. 17. Your returns for this dispensary show a general falling off Here, also, not a single operation was performed.
( 3 ) Fyzabad. 18. Beyond the fact that the books were up to date, the instruments in good order (though some were in want of repairs), and the medicines, both European and native, of good quality and well kept, little is stated in your report as to the general condition of this dispensary. The rise however of out-door patients, from 5,865 in 1869 to 7,332 in 1870, shows that the people have confidence in the officer who was in charge. The increase in the numbers cured and relieved was 440 ; in the " ceased to attend and no better" it was 901. The number of deaths, 79, seems large, and might have elicited some explanation. Gondah. 19. With the general working of this dispensary you were satisfied; the buildings were undergoing thorough repairs; and the stores, instru- ments, and books, were in good order. The total number of patients rose from 7,419 to 9,076; but the num- ber of operations fell from 137 to eighty-eight, out of which ten, as against one in 1869, were capital. The fall in native subscriptions from Rs. 3,430 to, Rs. 1,241( 4 ) ones fell from 293 to 106. The number of out-door patients relieved rose from 5,750 to 7,826, which is satisfactory. 26.The Officiating Chief Commissioner has noted your remarks on the various officers in charge. He would, however, observe that the absence of professional attainments is poorly compensated by character, however good ; and that although the conduct and qualifications of the Hospital Assistants in charge of the Branch Dispensaries of Mahmudabad, Bilgrám, Rámnagar, and Rámsanai, are spoken of as good, the number of operations performed in these four institutions was only six. 27.Your report on the Lunatic Asylum shows that the system and the management are excellent, and that under the judicious and humane control of Dr. Cannon, the institution has done its work well. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, H. B. HARINGTON, M. A., Offg. Secy. to the Chief Commissioner, Oudh.
REPORT ON DISPENSARIES IN THE PROVINCE OF OUDH, FOR THE YEAR 1871. LACKNOW :-Printed at the OUDH GOVERNMENT PRESS.
Annual Inspection Report of the Dispensaries in Oudh, for the year 1871. RÁI BARELI DISPEN- SARY. I visted the station of Rái Bareli on the 21st January 1872. The dispensary was under the superintendance of Dr. Charles Cameron, recently transferred from the Central Jail Lacknow. Dr.Charles Cameron, still maintains the high character my predecessor gave him for ability and zeal, and on my visit, I was pleased to see how much his kindness was appreciated by the Native Residents. 2nd Grade Sub-Assistant Surgeon, Nim Chund Gooptoo, impressed me with the opinion of his being one of the best and most active of his Class in Oudh. He was most favorably reported on by Dr. Seaman. The Dispensary when I saw it was in admirable order, the sanitation perfect, and the dry-earth system carried out. The establishment of servants was complete. The medicines both European and Native good and sufficient. The Surgical Instruments, Books, Records &c., were all well kept. There were no complaints. I saw 31 in-door patients, nine of whom were admitted from actual privation. There had been two operations successfully performed by the Sub-Assistant Surgeon, one for the removal of Staphyloma in the left eye, the other a very large Tumour in the back. On the day of my visit there had been an attendance of out-door patients to the number of 45, 22 being new cases. A falling off in the out-door attendance during the year, is due to the fact that medical relief was largely given to the inhabitants of numerous villages in the District by Native Doctors on deputation. The returns for the last 3 years shew a gradual decrease in the ad- missions and daily average attendance of in-door patients, at the same time there has been a slight increase in the daily average attendance of out-door patients. The Native subscriptions have increased in amount. There is considerable reduction in the cost of dieting in-door patients this year. The following statistical return shows the state of the Dispensary during the years 1870-71. 1870. 1871.

PRATÁBGARH DISPENSARY. I found Mr. Hart, the Medical Officer in charge of the Dispensary, actively employed in his duties. He is an energetic and intelligent officer and justly esteemed by all classes of the community. 3rd Grade Sub-Assistant Surgeon, Kassey Kinkur Mittre, is report- ed by Mr. Hart, as follows :( 3 ) The Dispensary, as reported by me last year, is a wretched building. The Cutcherry, applied for by Mr, Hart at my recommendation, not being available, an appeal was made by the Deputy Commissioner to the T'alukdars, who responded by a subscription of Rs. 4,224, with a promise of as much more if required, and the building of a new Hospital is to be commenced at once. The establishment of servants was complete. The Books, Medicines, and Surgical Instruments, were all in good order. I heard no complaints. There were 16 in-door patients, among the cases there were two operations, both doing well, one was an amputation of the thigh. For the last 3 years there has been a gradual falling off in the in-door attendance, but this year there is an increase of out-door patients.

SULTÁNPUR DISPENSARY. The Dispensary was in charge of Assistant Surgeon Franklin, who still maintains the high opinion I formed of him on my previous Inspection. 1st Class Hospital Assistant Ushruff Ali Khan, joined the Dispen- sary in September. Dr. Franklin, reports that his conduct is good, but that he is wanting in activity, his professional qualifications are very limited, and he is quite unfit for his present appointment. From personal obser- vations I deemed Hospital Assistant Ushruff Ali Khan, so unfitted for any medical employment, that I ordered him to appear before the next Invaliding Committee in April. The Dispensary out-houses suffered severely from the late heavy rains, but were about to be repaired. The medicines and surgical instruments were in good order. The books, records &c., were written up to date. The establishment was complete. There were 10 Patients in Hospital, 7 male and 3 females. The Dispensary system is to be extended in the district during the next 12 months, by the building of four new Establishments. As the Chief Commissioner has authorized the entertainment of a Sub- Assistant Surgeon if the subscriptions exceed Rs. 72 monthly. I have recom- mended the appointment of a Sub-Assistant Surgeon from the Lahore School, who has petitioned for employment in the Province, in place of Hospital Assistant Ushruff Ali Khan. There has been a steady increase in the attendance at this Dispensary. The native subcriptions have increased. The cost of dieting patients has risen from 2.1 last year to 7.10 this year. A sum larger than that expended for the same purpose in any other Dispensary in the Province.
( 5 ) The statistics for the years 1870-71 are added :( 6 ) The compounder had been removed for carelessness, but his place was efficiently supplied. The medicines European and Native, were good, and sufficient. The surgical instruments were in good order, with the exception of the eye instruments, which though clean were unserviceable. The books, circulars, &c. were regularly kept up to date. The returns show a decrease in the out-door attendance at this dis- pensary. There is an increase in the native subscriptions this year. This is the only dispensary, which sends in a return of cost of dieting European patients, the amount being annas 4, and pie 3. The statistics of the years 1870-71, are added. 1870. 1871.

( 7 ) ONDA DISPENSARY. On the occasion of my visiting this Dispensary, Dr. Higginson, was on temporary leave. Dr. Higginson's attention to his duties, as shown by the regularity which characterises the transmission of his reports and the care with which they are prepared, is very noticeable. 3rd Grade Sub-Assistant Surgeon, Ráj Kumár Cundee, is well and favorably reported on, but his health has suffered considerably during his residence at Gonda, I therefore think it would be advisable to transfer him to Sultánpur, and re-place him by the Sub-Assistant Surgeon from Lahore. The hospital was very much damaged by the rains, but has been repaired. The books, instruments, returns, and records, were all in excellent order. I saw 12 patients in hospital. The out-door attendance of persons suffering from goitre is remark- able. The number being men 1,474, women 1,746, and 504 children. There was no cholera in this district. The attendance has been about the same as last year. The European subscriptions are large, but the Native subscriptions have gradually decreased for the last 3 years.

At the commencement of the year 3rd grade Sub-Assistant Surgeon, Hem Chunder Buttachargee was in charge of this Dispensary, till the arrival of Dr. Heffernan. I have every reason to be satisfied with Dr. Heffernan's performance of his duties, and regret that he has not a more extensive field for the exercise of his professional knowledge. Dr. Heffernan, reports favorably of the conduct and qualifications of Sub-Assistant Surgeon, Hem Chunder Buttachargee. The Dispensary is a wretched building, and quite unsuited for an Hospital, the ventilation is bad, and a large open drain runs through the compound. Two plans for alteration were submitted to me for my opinion, but I recommended that a new Hospital altogether should be built, which would be very little more expensive than the proposed alterations. The Hospital was, when I visited it, as clean and well regulated as possible for such a building. The Books instruments &c., were all that could be desired. There were 12 in-door patients, some of whom had undergone capital operations. Owing to tho defective ventilation many of these cases frequent ly were unsuccessful, an example of which I saw in one of the patients who had lately been skillfully operated upon for stone in the bladder, and who was then apparently sinking from Diarrh( 10 ) 1870. 1871.

During the early part of the year, this dispensary was in visiting charge of the Civil Surgeon of Lucknow. Subsequently Mr. Kidd of the Subordinate Medical Department was appointed. During the prevalence of Cholera Mr. Kidd showed considerable activity in his duties. He has since been obliged to go on leave, in consequence of ill health. The conduct and qualifications of 1st Class Hospital Assistant Bhoyro Pershaud Pautuck are good. The Hospital is well attended, and the books, circulars, and surgi- cal instruments &c. are well kept. There has been an increase in the attendance. There is a falling off in the European and Native subscriptions ; the Native subscriptions however this year exceed those of 1869. The cost of dieting in-door patients was only 6 pie each, the lowest in the province. The following statistics for 1870-71, are added. 1870. 1871 Remaining under treatment on 1st January, ... 15 68 In-door patients admitted during the year, ... 195 207 Out-door patients admitted during the year, ... 3,063 3,433 Total, ... 3,303 3,408

I visited the station on the 5th February. It was in medical charge of Mr. McReddie, who had lately been Officiating Superintendent of the Central and District Jails at Lucknow. Mr. McReddie, bears a high character in the district for industry and intelligence, and still preserves
( 14 ) the very high character given of him by my predecessor, he was thoroughly conversant with every detail connected with his duties, and I was much pleased with the order, and regularity of the medical estab- lishment committed to his care. 2nd class Hospital Assistant, Kalee Parshad, is reported by his superior, to have very good qualifications in his profession. His conduct throughout the year has likewise been very good. He has not however passed his examination to a higher grade ; neither has he qualified him- self in English. The dispensary was in excellent order on the occasion of my visit. The medicines and books were all that could be desired, and the poisons segregated. There were 8 male and 2 female in-door patients, there was a success- ful case of Lithotomy, 2 wounds of the scalp, and a fracture of the humerus. The rest of the patients were suffering from ordinary diseases. There were 13 operations for stone performed in this hospital during the year. There has been a steady increase in the number attending this dis- pensary during the last 3 years. The following statistical tables of the Dispensary, for the years 1870, 1871,are added. 1870. 1871.

I visited this station on the 8th and 9th of February. The Dispensary was in medical charge of Dr. Duncan, who had been transferred from the Civil Surgeoncy of Bára Banki. Dr. Duncan is not so popular as could be desired, and since my return to Lacknow, he has applied to be removed to the Military Service of Government, which application I have thought it desirable to forward. Dr. Duncan reports as follows, regarding the Sub-Assistant Surgeon, in medical charge, Taríní Churn Dutt, 2nd grade, who was attached to the Dispensary during the year. "He obtained six months' leave of absence, when the duties were carried on by the Jail Hospital Assistant. The Sub-Assistant Surgeon's conduct has been good, his qualifications are of a high order, but it is to be regretted they are turned to little
( 20 ) practical account. All that it is necessary to remark is that the Dispen- sary was in a more prosperous condition under the Hospital Assistant, than it has been under the Sub-Assistant Surgeon." When I visited the Dispensary I found it in sad disorder on account of the roof being replaced by a new one, the building otherwise is very good, the great objection to the internal arrangements consists in the Lock Hospital Establishments being in the same building as the Dispen- sary, not only creating by contiguity much disorder, but bringing the respectability of the Hospital into question. The Commissioner of the Division has kindly undertaken to have the Lock Hospital removed at once, indeed it would have been done before, but there was some hesi- tation on account of the uncertainty of the European Troops remaining in the Station, this question I believe now is settled in the affirmative and a new Lock Hospital will be commenced forthwith. The books, medicines, and surgical instruments were all in perfect order, and the poisons segregated. There were 7 in-door patients.

The condition and working of the institution is most creditable to him. He is punctual and accurate with his returns, kind to his patients, and successful in treatment, his con- duct and qualifications are very good. There were 16 in-door patients, among them 2 cases of lithotomy. The stores, surgical instruments, books &c., were in excellent order. The hospital was a pattern of cleanliness, and order.

The conduct of 1st class Hospital Assistant Meer Cassim Ally, attached to the Government Dispensary, is reported exemplary, and his qualifications of a first rate order.

There has been an increase in the out-door, but a decrease in the in-door attendance.

Dr. Cannon reports that the conduct of 3rd Grade Sub-Assistant Surgeon, Nobin Chunder Mitter is good, and that he is to be fully trust- ed in every respect. His qualifications are first class. This establishment is one of considerable importance in the City of Lacknow as I mentioned in a previous report. The medical arrangements of Lacknow are to be supplemented by the opening of the Balrámpur Hospital on the 1st March next. It is a building erected by the Raja of Balrámpur at a very great expense, and he has funded a lac of rupees for its permanent endowment. There has been a considerable increase in the attendence at the dis- pensary during the year.

ARCHER, Dy. Insptr. General of Hospitals, Indian Medical Service. NOTE.No. 3256. FROM H. B. HARINGTON, ESQUIRE, M. A., OFFG. SECY. TO CHIEF COMMISSIONER, OUDH. To C. ARCHER, ESQUIRE, M. I., DEPUTY INSPECTOR GENERAL OF HOSPITALS, HER MAJESTY'S INDIAN FORCES. Dated Lucnow, 18th July 1872. SIR, I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your Annual Inspection Report of the Dispensaries in Oudh for the year 1871, and in reply to communicate the following remarks. 2. The admissions and discharges have been, calculated according to the calendar, the Financial Statements for the Official Year. It would appear that at a total cost of Rs. 46,478, the number of persons treated was118,32l, and that of these 102,995, were cured; 1,499, relieved; 116, incurable; 535, died; 11,401, result unknown; 1,775, remaining under treatment at the year's end. 3. The state of the Dispensaries was on the whole satisfactory, that of the Rái Barelí, Eaizabad, Hardui, and Unáo Institutions partiou- larly so. 4. In Bharaich and Pratábgarh the defective buildings will be replaced by new ones as soon as means permit. In Pratábgarh this is already being done, through the liberality of the T'alukdárs who responded to the call of the Deputy Commissioner by a subscription of Rs. 4,224, with a promise of as much more if required. This is very satisfactory, and Sir George Couper would be glad to know the names of these public spirited gentlemen. In Bharaich also it is hoped that a new Dispensary will be erected at an early date. 5. That, with the introduction of the new Rate, subscriptions should in some districts fall off is to be regretted, but is not altogether surpris- ing. The liberality of the Pratábgarh Talukdárs has been already notic- ed; and it is a source of congratulation that in Sultánpur subscriptions have more than tripled; in Faizabad there is an increase, which Sir George Couper is glad to note; and though in Rái Barelí and in Gonda there is a falling off, the amounts subscribed are still large. In Bára Ban ki it is said that the amount subscribed, though less than in 1870 is more than in 1869; what this amount was is not stated.
( 2 ) 6. In Bharaich there was a sad falling off ; and perhaps, no district appreciates Dispensaries more, or is willing to subscribe towards them less than Hardui. The Branch Dispensaries in this, and in the neighbouring district, Kheri, appear to have been dependent on the Government for their support. 7. Of the Sultánpur Dispensary you remark that the cost of dieting patients has risen from Rs. 0-2-1 last year to Rs. 0-7-10 this year, a sum larger than that expended for the same purpose in any other Dispensary in the Province. I am to ask that this may be explained. The return appended seems to show that more in-door patients were under treatment, and at a less cost than in 1870 ; and it seems not unlikely than the figures Rs. 0-7-10 may be a clerical error for Rs. 0-1-10. 8. It does not appear whether surgical operations, capital or other have been performed in Bára Bankí; and in the Mahmudabad Dispensary the amount of these operations is very small. 9. Sir George Couper would be glad to know whether the Rájáh has ever been asked to give his support to this useful institution. Its subscription list is infinitesimally small. 10. In the Sítápur Dispensary improvement may be hoped for this year, under a different regime. 11. Sir George Couper concurs in your notice of officers under your control; and is convinced that the Department could not be in better hands. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, H. B. HARINGTON, M. A. Offg. Secy. to the Chief Commissioner, Oudh.

REPORT ON DISPENSARIES IN THE PROVINCE OF OUDH, FOR THE YEAR 1872. LUCKNOW:No. 1179A of 1873. FROM THE JUNIOR SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMR., OUDH. TO DR. ARCHER, DEPUTY INSPECTOR GENERAL OF HOSPITALS, INDIAN MEDICAL SERVICE. LUCKNOW CIRCLE, Dated Lucknow, the 7th March 1873. SIR, I am directed by the Officiating Chief Commissioner to ack- nowledge the receipt of the Annual Report on the Civil Dispensaries for the last year and to remark as follows : ( 2 ) 9. He however regrets to observe, that the two branches in Faiza- bad are entirely dependent on government aid, they form a marked con- trast in this respect to the outlying dispensaries in Gonda and Kheri, in which very considerable subscriptions have been received from the native population. 10. The cost of in-door patients appears to have varied considerably in the different districts, and no explanation has been offered on this subject. 11. In Bára Banki the average cost was 7 pie only, while in Sul- tánpur 2 annas 10 pie are the figures given, and in some of the branch establishments the in-door patients entirely supported themselves. While on this subject, I am to remark that no reply appears to have been received to a somewhat similar query put in the 7th para, of my letter No. 3256 dated 18th July last. 12. Your remarks on the police hospitals at Kheri, Hardui, and Faizabad, will be forwarded for the consideration of the Inspector-Gene- ral of Police. 13. The Officiating Chief Commissioner fully approves of the re- moval of the Sítápur Lock Hospital from the Civil Dispensary to a more suitable quarter. 14. With reference to the remarks made respecting the water sup- ply in the Jail hospital at Rái Barelí, I am to observe, that if there is any doubt about the purity of the water, it should be carefully analysed. 15. The Commissioners of Faizabad and Sítápur will be sent a copy of your remarks with regard to the state of the wells in the Bharaich and Hardui hospitals respectively. 16. The Officiating Chief Commissioner has noted your remarks on the conduct and qualifications of the Officers in charge of these Dispen- saries ; and I am to express his sincere regret that he is about to be de- prived of the advice and assistance which you have always so cordially rendered, with regard to the affairs of the department from the charge of which you are so shortly to retire. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, N. M. HORSFORD, Junior Secretary, to the Chief Commissioner, Oudh. PRINTED AT THE OUDH GOVERNMENT PRESS.
Annual Inspection Report of the Dispensaries in Oudh, for the year 1872. RÁI BARELÍ DISPEN- SARY. I visited this station on the 14th November 1872. Surgeon Cameron who is in Medical charge of the district has recently returned from privilege leave, he accompanied me to the various Medical establishments in the station, and I was pleased to see the kind and con- siderate manner in which he attended to the sick natives under his care. Third Grade Sub-Assistant Surgeon, Raj Coomar Coondoo, has re- cently been transferred from the Government Hospital at Gonda, and Surgeon Cameron reports him as having a superior knowledge of his pro- fession, and to be a hard working man, he is in charge of the Government Charitable Dispensary. 3rd Class Hospital Assistant, Shaikh Abdoulah, attached to the Police Hospital is reported to be a well conducted and intelligent man, has not passed the English examination. 3rd Class Hospital Assistant, Khoob Lal, is reported to be a steady officer, has not passed the English test in languages, is attached to the Jail Hospital. Medical Pupil, Ahmed Hossein, is well behaved and making good progress in his professional knowledge, he has passed the English test in language, and is being regularly instructed by the Civil Surgeon who takes much interest in his progress. Medical Pupil, Mahomed Raheem Khan, was convicted of stealing Government stores and sentenced to six month's imprisonment with hard labor. The Charitable Dispensary when inspected was in excellent order, the dry earth system carried out in its entirety. Medicines good and sufficient, poisons segregated, instruments, books, and records kept up to date. There were 25 in-door patients on the day of my visiting the Hospital, 8 surgical, and the remainder medical cases, I regret to say that five of this number were admitted from actual privation. The Hospital is within easy distance of every quarter of the City, it is well raised, and the drainage perfect, there is accommodation for 30 in-door patients with a separate ward for lunatics. The water supply is good, the Government latrine has recently been removed to make way for a new poor house, a temporary latrine having been erected pending arrangements for a more permanent structure. Police Hospital has accommodation for 14 patients, and is sufficiently ventilated, of an average number of 460 men, nine were in Hospital when I visited it, of which number four were suffering from fever.
( 2 ) Jail Hospital is much too small for the purposes intended, but I was given to understand that the whole of the Jail establishment was but of a temporary nature, the drainage however is good. The water slightly- brackish from the presence of saline matter, but its use has not proved unwholesome. There were 16 prisoners in Hospital, eight of whom were suffering from fever. All the books, reports, and instruments in good condition, copies of all circular orders being kept. The health of the Police during the year has been good. Fever has been the chief disease, there was one case of cholera in May and another in June, both recovered, it was ascertained that both the men so suffering had been on duty in cholera stricken localities. The health of the Prisoners has been good throughout the year, in June when cholera was very severe in the city, one male and one female prisoner were attacked, the former recovered, the latter died, the prisoners were at once removed to a cholera camp and the progress of the disease immediately ceased.

I visited this station on the 16th of November 1872. The Medical establishments of this district are in charge of Mr. Hart, Honorary Assistant Surgeon, who has been 24 years in the service of Government. Mr. Hart's services during the prevalence of the severe outbreak of cholera during the last hot weather have been most praise- worthy, and have procured for him the special recognition of the Chief Commissioner of the Province, his report on the disease has been forward- ed to the Inspector General of Hospitals. Third Grade Sub-Assistant Surgeon, Abinash Chunder Goopto, is reported by Mr. Hart to be an officer of good conduct, with an excellent theoretical knowledge of his profession, he has recently left College, and only requires experience to make him a good practitioner. Second Class Hospital Assistant, Dewa Singh, attached to the Jail Hospital, his conduct and qualifications are very good, has passed the English test in language. During the prevalence of the cholera epidemic in this district two Hospital Assistants were attached temporarily to the staff of the Civil Surgeon, they have been removed to other duties. There is no medical pupil. The Government Charitable Dispensary was formerly reported on as inefficient, the designs for a new building have been approved of, and I believe the Chief Commissioner's sanction given for its erection, the funds for this purpose having been raised by private subscriptions. When I visited the Hospital there were 20 in-door patients, 13 male, 5 female, and two children, of this number there were two operations for stone, and two for tumours, the operations had been successful, and were in all respects well performed, nine of the patients were medical, the remainder surgical cases. The Hospital establishment was perfect in every way, the instru- ments in good order, the poisons segregated, books and records kept up to date. Jail Hospital is on a level with the surrounding ground, in the Jail compound, is in good repair, out of an average of 391 prisoners there were five in Hospital, but nothing of any marked character.
( 4 ) Police Hospital is a new building with an East and West aspect, having a long ward capable of accommodating 20 patients, there are rooms to the North and South for the isolation of infectious diseases, and for the Hospital Assistant and Dispensary, the building is lofty and well venti- lated, the wells kutcha pukka, the roof is built on O'Donnel's plan, and the building generally suitable for the purposes of a Hospital, the water supply is good, and the outhouses and latrines efficient. The average number of Police in Pratábgarh is 360, when I visited the Police Hos- pital I found 20 patients, of which number 11 were suffering from fever and dysentery. During the epidemic of cholera last hot weather, not one prisoner suffered from the disease, and only three Policemen, of which number one died and two recovered. Two Branch Dispensaries have been recently opened in this district. The statistical Dispensary tables for the years 1871-72, are sub- mitted. Surgical operations. 1871. 1872.

I visited this station on the 17th November 1872. Assistant Surgeon Franklin is an intelligent and industrious Officer, he has hitherto been Officiating in the Oudh Commission, but having been confirmed by the Government of India in his appointment to the pro- vince has been posted to Bára Banki. Second Class Hospital Assistant, Abdool Wahid, is reported by Dr. Franklin as a man of very good character, with an ordinary knowledge of his profession, has passed the English test in language, he is in charge of the Government Charitable Dispensary. First Class Hospital Assistant, Ushruf Ali Khan, this man's conduct is good, he is however utterly useless, he appeared before the Annual In- validing Committee in April last, and was recommended for pension, but up to the present time his name has not appeared in the Gazette, he is in charge of the Police Hospital. Third Class Hospital Assistant, Ahmed Khan, conduct good, qualifi- cations indifferent, has not passed in English language. The two Medical pupils attached to this station deserted the day after reporting themselves, their absence has been reported to the Military authorities, and are to be tried by Court Martial. The Charitable Dispensary is in good repair, the water supply is good, obtained from two pukka wells in the compound, the ground in the vicinity is open, the servants houses and latrines require repair after the late rains, the money for which has been passed, dry earth conservancy is adopted and carefully superintended, the medicines good, poisons segregated, books and instruments carefully kept. There were 12 in-door patients when I visited the Hopital, seven medical, the rest surgical cases, of the latter there were two operations, one excision of the breast, and the other operation for stone, both progressing favorably. Jail Hospital is a large building capable of holding 45 patients, well ventilated and drained. Police Hospital well adapted for the purpose, and of recent construc- tion, of good elevation and drainage, situated at considerable distance from the jail.
( 6 ) The health of the police and prisoners during the year has been very good, the jail has been exceptionaly healthy, not a single case of epidemic disease having occured, it may be remarked as interesting, that cholera was very fatal in all parts of the district for a considerable period during the year.

FAIZABAD DISPENSARY. The medical duties of the Civil Station of Faizabad are in the charge of Surgeon John Cameron, M.D., an Officer of upwards of 12 years' service Dr. Cameron maintains the high opinions formed of him by myself and predecessor, he is an officer of great intelligence and experience.
( 7 ) 3rd Grade Sub-Assistant Surgeon, Greesh Chunder Mitter, in charge of the Charitable Dispensary has been upwards of five years in Govern- ment employ. Dr. Cameron reports that Greesh Chunder's conduct is good, and that his qualifications are of an average character. 2nd Class Hospital Assistant, Ram Lall Singh's conduct is favorably reported on by Dr. Cameron, and his qualifications are far above the average, he is in charge of the Jail Hospital. 2nd Class Hospital Assistant, Shaikh Abbas Ali, conduct good, quali- fications fair, in charge of the Police Hospital. No Medical pupils. The Government Charitable Dispensary has been formerly described, it is a pukka building admirably adopted for the requirements of a Hospital, a ward for isolating disease and every convenience having been carefully considered, the floor is raised some four or five feet above the ordinary level of the compound. The buildings are in good repair, the dry earth system scrupulously observed. The establishment of hospital servants complete. Instruments, books, &c., in excellent order. Medicines good and efficient, poisons segregated. On the day of my visiting the hospital there were 34 out-door patients, and 16 in-door patients on the books of the Hospital, among the latter there there four patients suffering from fractures, a patient operated on for the removal of epithelial cancer, and another suffering from wound of the scalp, &c. Jail Hospital occupies one of the radiating Barracks in the inner circle of the Jail buildings, it is well adopted for a Hospital, and when I visited it was scupulously clean, the medicines and instruments in good order, likewise the books, out of a strength of 1,173 prisoners, 35 were in hospital, suffering chiefly from dysentery. Police Hospital. The Hospital is about 200 yards from the Police Lines, a low wretched building of mud, and not adopted for a Hospital, this is only a temporary arrangement however as new Police Lines and Hospital are about to be built. The average strength of the Police in Faizabad is 575, the average number of sick 10.3 when I visited the Hospital, there were only four men as patients suffering from the most ordinary diseases. The latrines and urinals are sufficient. The water supply good. The health of the prisoners during the year has been indifferent, Cholera and Dysentery having caused the death of an unusually large number of persons.

( 13 ) ATRAULA BRANCH DISPENSARY IN GONDA. 1st Class Hospital Assistant, Futteh Khan, still deserves the high opinion Dr. F. W. Higginson, formed of him as to his conduct and quali- fications. In April last he was promoted from the 2nd to the 1st Class, this partly explains the cause why the cost of the establishment is so much higher this year than in 1871.

I visited this station during the month of November 1872, throughout the year the Medical charge has been held by Assistant Surgeon P. I. Heffernan, an officer who is most attentive to his duties, and has my entire confidence. 3rd Grade Sub-Assistant Surgeon, Hem Chunder Bhattacharjee, M. B., Calcutta University, is in charge of the. Government Charitable Dispensary, his conduct and qualifications are very highly spoken of by the Civil Surgeon, and he is an officer who endeavours to make himself acquainted with the medical service of the day. 2nd Class Hospital Assistant, Hanooman Prashad Pattuck, is in charge of the Police Hospital, he was transferred from the Jail Hospital in conse- quence of a disagreement with the Police Authorities. Dr. Heffernan reports that he has always been attentive to his Hospital duties, and is a well conducted man, he has passed the prescribed examination in English.
( 15 ) 2nd Class Hospital Assistant, Ally Buksh, in charge of the Jail Hospital is reported to be a well conducted and intelligent man. The Government Charitable Dispensary has been condemned as unfit- ted for such an establishment, the drainage and ventilation being most imperfect, subscriptions for the erection of a new hospital have been collected, and the building is to be at once commenced upon, the drain which formerly passed through the Hospital compound, and which was objected to by me on two former occasions has been closed. The Hospital was in most excellent order when I visited it, scrupu- lously clean, and one of the best conducted Charitable Dispensaries in Oudh, the clothing and comfort of the patients carefully attended to, there were twelve in-door patients and eighty-five out-door patients on the books, but none of special interest. The Hospital establishment was complete, the instruments and books in excellent order. The water supply abundant and of good quality, but the well being open to the public outside the Hospital compound, was not kept so clean as desirable, this has been represented by the Civil Surgeon and the Municipal Committee without however, the necessary authority for the al- teration in the arrangements thought desirable. Instruments in good repair, medicines sufficient and of good quality, poisons segregated. Returns and reports kept up to date. The Jail Hospital is imperfectly ventilated, on the occasion of my visit there were six patients suffering from the ordinary diseases of the district. There were 25 patients in the Police Hospital, 12 of whom were suf- fering from malarious fever. The following Dispensary statistical returns for the years 1871-72, are added:( 16 ) 1871. 1872.

I visited the Station of Kheri on the 6th of November 1872. The Medical Officer, Assistant Surgeon Calloway, was absent from the station on leave, having suffered from a severe attack of cholera a short time previously. 1st Class Hospital Assistant, Lalla Ramsahoy, attached to the Sadr Dispensary, and educated at the Calcutta Medical College, is reported to be intelligent and has a very fair knowledge of his profession, his conduct good and attentive to his patients, has passed the examination in the En- glish language. 3rd Class Hospital Assistant, Koonjbeharce Sookul, attached to the Jail and Police Hospital, educated at the Agra Medical School, his qualifi- cations are good, and his knowledge of English language excellent, his con- duct lately has been most unsatisfactory, and is now under investigation for neglect. Medical Pupil, Mohomed Saleem, joined on the 6th of the present month. Having some time previously reported himself to the Civil Sur- geon for duty, but deserted after remaining in the station one day, he has sent in a petition to resign the service, which has not been accepted by the Inspector General. The Government Charitable Dispensary consists of two separate build- ing in the same compound, one for male the other female patients, the for- mer has been re-built this year, it has three large wards, two for patients, the other for an operating room and dispensary, the ventilation good, and the surrounding ground open and well drained. The Hospital for females is smaller and has accommodation for eight patients, The cook-houses and latrines are in good order, dry earth sanitation being carried out. Water good and abundant from a well 300 yards distant from the Hos- pital, another well is to he built when funds are available. There were eleven patients in the Hospital when 1 visited it, the majority suffering from dysentery and fever.
( 18 ) The Jail Hospital is of the ordinary kind, there were four patients, three suffering from malarious fever and one dysentery, out of a strength of 197 prisoners. The Police Hospital is a wretched building, there were twelve patients in it suffering from fever, total strength 386. The instruments were complete and in serviceable order, medical chests and almirahs in good repair, books, returns, records and circu- lar orders kept up to date. Towards the end of the year malarious fever had been very prevalent amongst the Prisoners and Police, the latter from great exposure suffered severely, the former chiefly those who were new prisoners and admitted with the complaint. The following statistical Dispensary returns for the years 1871-72 are submitted :( 19 ) GOLA BRANCH DISPEN- SARY IN KHERI.

In medical charge of Surgeon Major McKeller, up to the end of Oc- tober 1872, it was located in the Civil Dispensary (a most objectionable place), on the change in the appointment of Civil Surgeon taking place I thought it a good opportunity to remove the patients and transferred the charge to the Military Department in Cantonments, these alterations took place on the 8th of November, the building utilized is the Hospital formerly belonging to the Native Infantry (previously stationed at Sítápur), it is at present undergoing repairs and alterations, and when completed it will be admirably adopted for the purposes for which it is intended. There were but two cases in the Hospital, one suffering from Gonorrh( 21 ) 2nd Grade Sub-Assistant Surgeon, Tarini Churn Dutt, is in charge of the Government Charitable Dispensary, his conduct and qualifications are reported to be very good. 1st Class Hospital Assistant, Abdool Khan, reported favorably upon by the Civil Surgeon, is attached to the Jail Hospital. 2nd Class Hospital Assistant, Mirza Hussun Ruza Beg, attached to the Police Hospital, his conduct and qualifications are reported to be moderately good. Medical Pupil, Gajadhur Pershad, is well behaved, and making good progress in his professional knowledge, he has passed the English test in language, and is regularly instructed by the Civil Surgeon. The establishments of servants were complete and efficient, in the Government Charitable Dispensary, Police, and Jail Hospitals. Government Charitable Dispensary is as I have formerly reported an excellent building, the estimate for repairs necessary at this season of the year has been submitted, the Lock Hospital which is under the same roof is about to be removed to a more convenient spot in Canton- ments, in fact its removal took place the day after my visit, a change most advantageous to the well-being of both institutions. There were eight in-door patients and 28 out-door patients on the Hospital books. The Jail Hospital is one of the usual barracks within the walls, it is a kutcha building, well adopted for the purposes of a hospital, there were ten patients in hospital, seven of whom were suffering from intermittent fever. The Police Hospital is a good kutcha pukka building, clean and well ventilated, 14 patients in the hospital were suffering from intermittent fever. The dry earth system is carried out in all these Institutions. Latrines and urinals carefully supervised, sufficient and clean. Drainage of both Jail and Police lines very good, likewise the water supply. Medicines good in quality and efficient in quantity, the poisons se- gregated and locked up. Instruments, complete and serviceable. Books, reports, returns, and records kept up to date. The health of the Police and Prisoners during the year has been good, of the prisoners especially good, the daily average sick amounting to one per cent, the total number of deaths in the year seven only.

I visited this Station in December. This district is in Medical Charge of Mr. McReddie, a most active and zealous officer, and who has shown great assiduity in the discharge of his duties during the late severe epidemic of cholera, his conduct on this occa- sion has been brought to the notice of the Chief Commissioner. 2nd Class Hospital Assistant, Kali Pershad, is attached to the Sádr Dispensary, Mr. McReddie reports most favorably on this man's conduct and qualifications, he is a good operator and most attentive to his duties, he has not passed in the English test, but as he has promised to attend the zil'a school which is contiguous to the Hospital, I hope that he will soon be able to qualify himself. 2nd Class Hospital Assistant, Dabi Pershad, attached to the Police and Jail Hospitals, has passed in English, Mr. McReddie reports likewise of this man most favorably, he being most attentive and zealous in the discharge of his duties.
( 24 ) Medical Pupil, Mahomed Abbas, was admitted into the service on the 21st June 1872, and is attached to the Sádr Dispensary, this boy's conduct and character are both very good, he has passed the English qua- lification examination, Mr. McReddie and his Assistant give daily instruc- tions to this promising lad, who in addition to his Hospital duties which are very light, attends the zil'a school regularly. The Dispensary has been already described in former reports. I found the building in excellent repair and scrupulously clean, so likewise were the detached out-houses, latrines, and dead house, the dry earth conservancy is carried out, and a pukka well is to be built at an ex- pense of 200 Rupees, I saw eight in-door patients in the Hospital, some of a serious nature, the close vicinity of the new railway makes this insti- tution of great value. The Jail Hospital is a kutcha building tiled, well ventilated and in perfect repair, on my visiting the Jail there were only two patients in the Hospital out of aggregate number of 197 prisoners, these patients were suffering from very slight complaints. The Police Hospital is quite unfitted for such a purpose, there is no ventilation, the roof is flat, leaky, and I should think, very insecure, there were six patients under treatment, suffering principally from the ordi- nary malarious diseases of the country. The water supply of the Jail and Police lines is from pukka wells, the jail wells are covered in and water is drawn from these by chains and buckets, they are cleared out twice yearly, the wells elsewhere are quite unprotected from contamination and were only cleared out this year for the first time since their construction. The drainage around the Jail and Police lines is on the whole satis- factory. The supply of medicines both European and country is sufficient, the poisons in the Sádr and Jail Hospitals being segregated. The instruments complete and in good order, so likewise are the books. Returns forwarded up to date, all circular orders duly filed, and copies of returns and reports kept. The health of the Police and prisoners during the year has been on the whole good, the prisoners have been exceptionally healthy, but the Police have suffered from the great prevalence of malarious fever present in the district. The following statistical Dispensary returns for 1871-72 are sub- mitted. 1871. 1872.

( 28 ) LUCKNOW. The whole of the Medical Establishments in Lucknow are under the control of Surgeon Major Cannon, M. B., an officer of unwearied industry, and great experience.

Establishment of Hospital servants, everything that could be desired at the beginning of a large Hospital. Bulrampúr Hospital. This admirable building was opened for the reception of patients on the 1st April 1872, it is situated on an elevated plateau to the west of the Chutter Munzil and Kaishur Bagh, and has been erected at the sole expense of the Maharajah of Bulrampúr who has sup- plemented the gift by funding a lac of Rupees for the monthly pay of the establishment, latterly he has in addition given the very handsome sum of one thousand Rupees monthly for the purpose of establishing a Medical Vernacular School, which is to be shortly opened, and as this school will be associated with each district Municipal Committee in the province, the nu- cleus of an excellent Medical School for Oudh will be formed, which will be in active operation immediately. The elevation of the main wards is 27 feet, while that of the female and the European wards is 29 feet. The whole Hospital has been divided into five wards, each being built in distinct blocks, quite separate from one another, each patient in the main wards has a superficial area of about 92.125 square feet, and a cubic space of 2026.7 cubic feet, while those in the female wards have an average space of 93 square feet, and 2229.3 cubic feet, and those in the European wards yet as much as 137.5 square feet, and 3,300 cubic feet per head. The contagious ward is a distinct building having two rooms, each 22 feet long, and 15 feet broad, and can well accomodate four to six patients. The ventilation is perfect, both through the doors and also through the sky- light windows constantly kept open. All the buildings are pukka of the best kind. No better building could have been planned for a Hospital, according to the recent improvements in Hygine. The ground round the Hospital is perfectly free and open, with a slight exception. Cook- houses are two, one for Hindús, and one for Mahomedans, both situated at the eastern side of the compound, at a distance of about 125 feet from the wards. They are quite separate from each other, and are perfectly lit for their purpose, dry earth is freely used in the latrines. Latrines and urinals. Each ward has an urinal attached to it at the cor- ner quite separate and beyond the current of the winds blowing through the wards. The latrines are two, one on the north and the other on the south, on each extremity of the compound, being 68 feet distant from the wards, and 75 feet to the west of the contagious diseases ward, and the Sub-Assistant Surgeon's quarters, each consists of eight seats in two compartments. Drainage. The ground is so elevated that no artificial drainage has been found necessary. Water supply is sufficient in quantity, supplied from a well in the com- pound, further arrangement is in preparation for supplying a tank to each ward, the water of the well is of the first quality.
( 36 ) Clothing, blankets, coats, and banians given during the winter and whenever necessary. Medicines both Europe and country are of the first quality and in sufficient quantity. The poisons are kept marked and locked up separately. Instruments, all in serviceable order, an indent has been sent for a further supply necessary for so large a Hospital. They are kept locked up in charge of the compounder. Books printed. English Nomenclature of Diseases and Dr. Buyper- theny's plan of treating Leprosy, one copy of each, three copies of Bradshaw's Arithmetic for students, and ten copies of Howard's Primer, Urdú, Ana- tomy, Medicine, Meteria Medica, Chemistry, Midwifery, and the treatment of Cholera a copy of each.

Circular orders, copies of all have been kept in proper order up to date. Out of 448 admissions up the end of November last, 82 have died, shewing an enormous mortality of 18.636 per cent. But considering that no less than 60 of this number were brought in an absolutely moribund state, the proper mortality should be calculated at only 5.67 per cent. of the admissions. Complaints. Some of the old establishment have been reported to the Committee through the Superintendent, Dr. Cannon, for inattention and disobedience to standing orders, everything now is progressing favorably, and the establishment is in good working order. On the day of my visit there were 79 out-door patients attending the Hospital, and 41 in-door patients, including cases of very serious nature, the return of 120 patients daily shows the value of the establishment, and when the Medical School is in full operation, doubtless a large increase in the attendance will be observeable.

These establishments are under the Superintendence of Surgeon J. C. Whishaw, an officer of great experience, his duties rarely come within my observation, as he is an officer acting under the orders of the Inspector General of Prisons, the few opportunities, however, I have of observing Surgeon Whishaw's medical knowledge, give me a very high opinion of his professional character. 1st Class Hospital Assistant, Sadoolah Khan, of the District Jail, is an excellent man both in his conduct and in his professional abilities. 3rd Class Hospital Assistant, Peer Khan, of the Central Prison, has no experience. He is not fit to be the first Hospital Subordinate in a large Jail Hospital. He is not well up in medicine or surgery. 3rd Class Hospital Assistant, Abdul Wahid, is also very inexperienced and requires constant watching. The Hospitals of the District and Central Jails are the usual wards of the radiating barracks, well adapted for the purpose, scrupulously clean, and under constant supervision. Medicines, Europe and country good and sufficient,the poisons segre- gated. Instruments in good order and repair. Hospital books kept up to date.

The Hospital is placed in central situation to the west of the Sádr Bazar, having a large compound surrounded by high walls, the accommo- dation for servants is most defective, and this having been brought to the notice of the Cantonment Committee, new houses have been ordered to be built, the latrines are defective and are to be re-built. Dry earth sanitation is carried out. Water supply good and efficient. The admissions into Hospital from Venereal disease amongst the Troops during the year 1871 were 25.64 per cent., and for the year 1872 18.90 per cent. being a decrease of 6.74 per cent.
( 43 ) The registration of Prostitutes extends to four miles around Canton- ments.

TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, OUDH, LUCKNOW. TO H. M. CANNON, ESQUIRE, M. B., DEPUTY SURGEON GENERAL, INDIAN MEDICAL DEPARTMENT, LUCKNOW. Dated Lucknow, the 24th June 1874. GENL. DEPARTMENT. SIR, I AM directed to acknowledge the receipt of your report on the working of the Oudh Charitable Dispensaries, for the year 1873. 2. During the past year the number of branch dispensaries increased from 14 to 29. But one of them, that at Ramsanai Ghat, closed at the end of the year. So the year 1874 commenced with 12 Sadr, and 28 branch dispensaries, against 12 Sadr and 14 branch dispensaries open at the beginning of 1873. 3. The number of patients treated was 188,291, being 43,519 more than in the preceding year. It is satisfactory too to note that the num- ber of persons relieved and cured was greater by 42,152 than in the year 1872, and that the number of deaths fell from 1,269 to 1,075. 4. The expenditure increased from Rs. 58,999-1-10 to Rs. 62,508-4-7, and the Chief Commissioner is glad to see that receipts, from sources other than Government contributions, rose from Rs. 32,847-10-8 to Rs. 38,173-13-10. The opening balance was Rs. 14,051-10-0, and the year closed with a balance of Rs. 14,834-8-0. These figures do not, I am to observe, quite correspond with those given in the returns for 1872, according to which the opening balance should have been Rs. 13,649-1-5. Para. 5. 5. You notice the difference that exists in the several districts regarding the cost per head for dieting in-door patients. In most instan- ces this is something under 2 annas, but at Bharaich it is said to have been Rs. 1-3-9, and at Bára Banki Rs. 1-5-4.* There must, the Chief Commissioner thinks, be some error in these figures, or the calculations must have been made on different principles, and Sir George Couper begs that you will explain to officers in charge of dispensaries how the calcula- tion should be made, in order to ensure uniformity in future returns. Para. 7. 6. In more than one passage you notice the ignorance and ineffi- ciency of the medical pupils attached to the dispensaries, and the Chief Commissioner agrees with you that it will be expedient to impress on the Medical Officers the importance of instructing and training these young men. *Since this was sent to Press, it has been reported that the average rate at Bára Bánki was only Rs. 0-1-1 The figures Rs. 1-5-4 were a mistake of the copyist.
( 2 ) Lucknow Lunatic Asylum. 7. The percentage of deaths to the total number treated has fallen from 30.43 to 10.18. The percentage is still high, but the deaths in this institution have, for some years, been so unfortunately numerous that the improvement is very marked. The Chief Commissioner has no doubt that Dr. Whishaw will leave undone nothing that will tend to diminish the mortality in this asylum. Balrámpur Hospital. 8. The number of persons treated has increased considerably, and this Hospital accomodates more in-door patients than any other institution in Oudh. The Chief Commissioner is not sure that the accounts given at page 7 show the total income or only the amount actually drawn during the year. In his opinion the total income should be shown. He trusts that the Committee have remedied the defects that you pointed out. King's Hospital. 9. Although the number of patients treated has fallen from 12,189 to 11,098, this is still the most numerously attended Hospital. The in- door patients were fewer than during the preceding year, yet the average daily number in hospital was rather higher than in 1872. The receipts and expenditure according to the return at page 8 exactly balance, and the Chief Commissioner thinks that the money actually drawn, and not the total available income, has been shown under receipts. 10. The exceedingly well written annual report on this Hospital to which you refer the Chief Commissioner, and the annual report on the Balrámpur Hospital, to which he is referred at page 6, have not been received from your office. Police Hospital Lucknow. 11. Your remarks regarding the dead-house will be communicated to the Inspector General of Police. Hazratganj Dispensary. 12. Notwithstanding the establishment of the Balrámpur Hospi- tal, nearly three thousand persons were treated at the Hazratgunj Dis- pensary. The expenditure is considerably less than the income, and there is a balance of nearly Rs. 1,800. The Chief Commissioner believes that it was at one time proposed to add this balance to the Funds of the Balrám- pur Hospital. If this is not done it would be as well to invest the money. Page 15. 13. The cost of dieting each in-door patient at the Saffipur Branch Dispensary should apparently be 9.02 pie. Bára Banki Dispensaries 14. At the Bára Banki Dispensary 47 capital operations were per- formed, far more than were performed in any other Hospital. The results of these operations are not stated, and the Chief Commissioner thinks it would be as well if it were always stated how many cases ended fatally, and in how many the operations were successful. Some of the subordinate Medical Officers are, the Chief Commissioner is aware, most successful operators, and I am to suggest that future reports should show the number of operations performed by each Civil Surgeon and his subor- dinates respectively.
( 3 ) 15. It is hoped that under the charge of native Doctor Hurmut Khan the Hydergarh Branch Dispensary has improved. Seetapoor Page 23. 16. It is not very clearly shown by the Civil Surgeon, where the income of the Mahmudabád Dispensary comes from. Rai Barelí. 17. The Funds of the Rái Barelí Dispensary are in a flourishing condition, and it would be as well to invest the balance. There is an independent Dispensary at Shankerpur in this District, which was established and is maintained by Rájah Dukhinarunjun Moo- kerjee, Bahadur, which is not mentioned in your report. Sultánpur. 18. The attendance at the Sultánpur dispensary was lower than that of any other Sadr Dispensary, there being only 3,853 patients, and of these 1,266 ceased to attend, a fact which does not say much for the popularity of the institution. The reasons for the falling off in attend- ance suggested by Dr. Cameron are the transfer of a popular Native Doctor and the opening of other dispensaries. With regard to the first reason suggested, the Chief Commissioner observes that the success of a dispensary must, or at any rate should, depend far more on the Civil Surgeon than on his subordinates. Pratábgarh. 19. The number of persons treated at the Pratábgarh Dispensary was second only to the number who attended at the King's Hospital, and the number of persons relieved and cured speaks well for the skill of Mr. Hart and his subordinates. The expenditure was heavy and far exceeded the income of the year, but there was fortunately a considerable balance to fall back on. The balance at the end of the year was little over Rs. 1,400, and it will therefore be necessary to study economy. The contingent expenses, Rs. 2,871-8-5, are much higher than those of any other Dispensary. Fyzabad. 20. The Chief Commissioner trusts that Dr. Cameron is mistaken in believing that subscriptions are "regarded by the ' donors ' as an ad- " ditional tax imposed upon them without the sanction of Government." But if the Civil Surgeon's opinion is correct, steps should immediately be taken to let the subscribers know that to subscribe is purely optional. The attention of the Commissioner Fyzabad Division will be invited to the remarks of Dr. Cameron as recorded at page 52 of your Report. Bharaich. 21. Sir George Couper agrees with you that the Assistant Surgeon should not be converted into a clerk. Mr. Cromarty asks for the ser- vices of a paid clerk, and I am to request that you will inform him that applications for incerease of establishment should be submitted separately ; such applications are out of place in an Annual Report. 22. The Chief Commissioner having already expressed his views regarding the Balrámpur Medical School, it is unnecessary to repeat them here.
( 4 ) 23. The results of the year's work, as shown in your report, are creditable generally to the Civil Medical Officers and their subordi- nates, and the Chief Commissioner feels confident that under your con- trol the efficiency of the Department will in no way diminish. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, H. J. SPARKS, Offg. Secretary to Chief Commissioner, Oudh.
No. 213 A./C.C. FROM DR. H. M. CANNON, DEPUTY SURGEON GENERAL, INDIAN MEDICAL DEPARTMENT, Lucknow Circle. To THE SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, OUDH. Dated Lucknow, 5th May 1874. SIR, I HAVE the honor to submit for the information of the Chief Com- missioner a summary view of the working of the Oudh Charitable Dispen- saries for the year 1873. * Lunatic Asylum, Bulrampur Hos- pital, King's Hospital, Unanee or Greck Hospital. 2. There were, in addition to the 4 Institutions noted in margin,* 12 Sadr and 29 Branch Dispensaries in operation throughout the Province during 1873. * Rám Sanai Ghát. 3. At the close of the previous year (1872) there were 12 Sadr and 14 Branch Dispensaries open in Oudh, whereas during 1873 one* Branch Dispen- sary was closed and 15 additional ones opened, showing an increase of 14 Branch Dispensaries at the end of the year under review. 4. On reference to Statement No. 3 attached to this report it will be found that as many as 188,291 persons received Medical aid at the Oudh Charitable Dispensaries during 1873, against 144,712 in 1872, showing an increase of 43,579 in attendance of in and out-door patients, whereas the deaths, which in 1872 numbered 1269, fell to 1075 during the year under review, giving an actual decrease of 194 in the mortality amongst those who sought medical aid at these Institutions during 1873. 5. A difference exists in many districts regarding the cost per head for dieting in-door patients. The explanation is as follows. In some Dispensaries, especially the Branch ones where the funds are low it is the custom to make the in-door patients supply their own food. In others some supply it and others do not, and I have reason to believe the cost of the latter is divided over the whole number of in-door patients fed and treated, hence the low average cost per head. In others again it is the rule for all in door patients to be supplied with food and hospital comforts from the funds of the institution, and it can easily be imagined how a few bad cases requiring Wine and Rum, &c., will run up the cost per head. No rule can therefore be strictly laid down as to this cost, which must fluctuate according to circumstances. From my own experi- ence in such matters I consider 1½ annas per head per diem a very fair average for food and hospital comforts.
( 2 ) 6. The Civil and Military Lock Hospital Reports have already been submitted to the Local Government, it is therefore unnecessary to reproduce them here. 7. The Chief Commissioner will I fear in many instances be dis- satisfied with the reports on the conduct and progress made by several of the native medical pupils attached to the Civil Dispensaries in the Province, I therefore consider it very desirable that the attention of Civil Surgeons should again be called to para. 17 G. G. O., Military Department, No. 402, dated 6th April 1872, where the duty of Medical Officers and their subordinates in supervising the conduct and discipline of their pupils is strictly laid down, and which appears in several cases to have been entirely lost sight of. 8. I think it advisable in concluding my remarks on the Medical Institutions of this Province to submit Dr. Bonavia's admirable Report on the opening and working of the Bulrampur Medical School during the year 1873, of which he is the Principal, and in the prosperity of which I take great interest. 9. The success which has already attended Dr. Bonavia's tact and energy in making the school what it is in so short a period, is deserving of special notice. 10. Not having assumed Medical charge of this Circle until the 15th January last, I regret to say I have been unable by press of current work to leave Lucknow for any length of time and inspect the numerous Sadr and Branch Dispensaries in Oudh. I will however give abstracts from my predecessor's notes and the several Annual Reports, together with the results of such personal inspections as I have been able to accomplish. LUNATIC ASYLUM. LUCKNOW. This institution has been under the superintendence of Surgeon Major, J. C. Whishaw, since the 19th February 1873. His ability and qualifications are too well known for me to say more in this Report. I visited it on the 31st January, 3rd February and 9th February 1874, on which occasion I minutely inspected the patients' food, clothing, estab- lishment and conservancy arrangements. Patients. The patients, with the exception of the 7 in hospital, presented an un- usually healthy appearance. This I attribute in a great measure to the deficiency in the rains, and the usually healthy season of 1873. The Gum- ti never once overflowed its banks, and most of the old and sickly inmates were carried off by Diarrhoea, Dysentery and Dengue during the unhealthy season of 1871 and 1872. Diet and clothing. The diet and clothing is the same as has obtained for several years. Both are excellent in quality and sufficient in quantity. Conservancy. The wards and yards are kept scrupulously clean and tidy, the dry earth system is carried out, and the night soil is buried in trenches freshly dug and filled in daily in different parts of the extensive gardens : a plan which has been found to answer so well in the Oudh Jails. There is no unpleasant smell or inconvenience whatever resulting from this system.
( 3 ) No night soil whatever is buried in the neighbourhood of the wells, or within a certain distance of the barracks. The establishment is the same as it has been for years. The propriety of altering it is now under discussion, and proposals have been made in correspondence now going on between this office, the Chief Commis- sioner and Surgeon General Indian Medical Service. Buildings. All the buildings appear to be in good repair with the exception of the godowns and cook-rooms which are being re-roofed. The wards are in good order. One female barrack had to be re-built from its foundation after the rains of 1873. The drainage of the upper part of the Asylum grounds is good. The lower portions near the river have not been flooded during the past year. The Bund seems to have answered its purpose, although as Dr. Whishaw states the river Gumtí did not once overflow its banks during 1873, owing to the scanty rains, so it would be premature to give an opinion as to its efficacy. The mortality during 1873, is very slight in comparison with past years, owing I believe to the causes above stated. It will be seen on re. ference to the Annual Report for 1873, that the deaths were only 16.14 per cent to strength. A present state of the inmates of the Asylum on the occasion of my inspection is herewith submitted :( 4 ) occasions patients are admitted and released, and every subject of import. ance connected with the administration of the institution during the month is brought up for discussion and orders. The sickness and mortality which occurred during the years 1871-72 have formed the subject of a special report to Government and need not again be entered into here. The following comparative statistical returns for 1872-73 are added :( 5 ) BULRAMPUR HOSPI- TAL, LUCKNOW. Surgeon Major J. C. Whishaw, Superintendent. Third Grade Assistant Surgeon Ishan Chunder Roy, M. B. has been in Medical charge since April 1872, the month in which the Hospital was first opened. His qualifications are first rate, and his conduct and atten- tion as regards his patients unexceptional. All his instruments are in good order, his books and records are up to date, but he is somewhat careless and indifferent as regards other matters in connection with the institution and the establishment. Second Class Hospital Assistant Bindrabun Dass is qualified in English, and is well spoken of by his superiors. The Assistant Surgeon mentions him in his report, as a sickly man of weak constitution but I have reason to believe he not only does his duty but gives material assistance in keeping up the English books and records. Syud Mecrun, Moostafa Hossein, Ameer Hossein. The 3 Medical Pupils noted in margin* are each of them backward, inattentive and irregular in their attendance. They are all inhabitants of Lucknow and its neighbourhood, and I think it was a mistake posting them to a city hos- pital. Such lads as a rule should be placed with Regiments and under Military Surgeons, where they will easily be taught discipline, and those from the country and at a distance can bo brought into the civil hospitals to learn their duty. The following remarks were written by me in the Visitor's book on the occasion of my last visit:( 6 ) the trees and plot of garden in front neglected. The garden coolie is evi- dently not employed for the purpose he was entertained. Syud Meerun, Moostafa Hossein, Ameer Hossein. " Up to the time I finished my Inspection none of the 3 Native Medi cal Pupils noted in margin in had made their appearance. They have already been report- ed in the Disposition Roll for April as irregular and indifferent both in attendance and conduct. I have ordered them to attend my office at 12 o'clock to-day for reprimand and examination. " Medical Pupils No. 1 and 2 made their appearance at my office at 12 o'clock, No. 3 Ameer Hossein having gone to his home without leave was not present. They could give no good reason for their absence from the hospital this morning; they appear to go and come as they please and are under no sort of restraint or discipline. " On asking them, they did not know the composition of the most sim- ple medicines or the names of any part of the body or alimentary canal. They state they are taught nothing of the kind at the hospital, only what they call their " duty" to stand by at an operation and attend to sick patients. I request these remarks may be circulated to every member of the committee." The following comparative statement is most satisfactory, inasmuch as it exhibits an enormous increase in the amount of in-door and out-door Medical relief rendered by this institution during 1873, on the previous year ; and reflects great credit on Assistant Surgeon Ishan Chunder Roy, and the management generally. I have many reasons to hope that the subjects I have brought to the notice of the Committee will for the future be attended to. For a detailed account of the working of this institution during 1873, I beg to refer to the annual report. 1872. 1873.

KING'S HOSPITAL, LUCKNOW. Surgeon Major J. C. Whishaw, Superintendent. Third Grade Assistant Surgeon Nobin Chunder Mitter is in medi- cal charge. He still maintains the high character he has always held amongst his official superiors as a well qualified and assiduous Medical Officer. I inspected this institution on the 14th April 1874, and found everything pertaining to the treatment and comfort of the sick, as well as the books and instruments, in excellent order. The average number of house patients during April were 34.45, and of out patients 121.6. 1 have no hesitation in saying this is one of the best managed and most popular Hospitals in the Province. First Class Hospital Assistant Meer Nassur Ally is attentive and trustworthy, and is well qualified in every respect. I am sorry to say I was much disappointed at what I heard of the irregular attendance and habits of two of the three medical pupils. I had to reprimand one for the slovenly and filthy appearance he presented. On examination I found them all exceedingly backward in their studies ; two of them could not answer the simplest questions in Materia Medica. Native Medical Pupil Syad Mooheeboollah Khan, slovenly in his appearance, inattentive and irregular in his habits and exceedingly back- ward. Native Medical Pupil John Mathew, quiet and attentive, has made fair progress in some subjects.
( 8 ) Native Medical Pupil Meer Ahsan Ally, a sharp lad, fairly advanced in his English studies, habits irregular and idle. For any further information I beg reference may be made to the exceedingly well written Annual Report, submitted by the Assistant Surgeon for the year under review( 9 ) The two Third Class Hospital Assistants 'Abdulwahid Khán, and Budde-oz-zoman are both reported as steady, attentive men, but scarcely in my opinion up to the mark in Medical experience for so important a post. First Class Hospital Assistant Sadúlla Khán, of the District Jail, is a very superior kind of Native Doctor, he is well qualified in English, and is considered trustworthy in every respect by his superiors. Native Medical Pupil Mirzá Abíd Hossein is attentive to his duties, and better advanced in his studies than most of the Lucknow lads of this class. The Jail Sanitary Report for 1873 furnishes all the information in detail that can be required. It is but fair to remark that all the credit is due to Dr. McReddie for the condition I found these Jail Hospitals in on the occasion of my inspection. He is now absent on three months privilege leave, during which period Dr. Higginson is officiating for him. POLICE HOSPITAL, LUCKNOW. The District and City Police Hospitals were inspected by me on the 24th March 1874. It is a well constructed building on a height above the Iron Bridge, and consists of 6 wards, both Hospitals being under one roof, to which is attached a prison ward for wounded patients under trial, closed in by iron railings. Outside there is a brick latrine with 4 compartments. The new dead house or post mortem room is a great improvement, but the windows require a gauze or wire net inside to prevent the rats and moongooses getting in and mutilating the bodies. Although this place with its furniture is kept scrupulously clean, there was a decided taint in the air, which should be overcome by the free use of McDougall's powder or Carbolic acid. I found on enquiry, only 1 lb. of Carbolic Acid and no McDougall's Powder had been indented for. An institution where post mortems are occurring frequently, and bodies sent in from the Districts in every stage of decomposition, should have at least 6 lbs. of the former and 12 of the latter. I requested an application might at once be made to the Central Jail Authorities for the above quantities on payment. The instruments, books, and copies of Circular orders are all pro- perty kept. The combined police force of this city and district consists of 1690 men, the total number under treatment on the day of my visit was 29 only. Second Grade Assistant Surgeon Chundí Churn Ghose is in Medical charge: his qualifications and conduct are well spoken of. Second Class Hospital Assistant Shekh Ramzán, formerly with the 13th Bengal Cavalry, is I believe a well qualified, trustworthy man, with superior knowledge of English.
( 10 ) On the whole I was well pleased with these Hospitals and their Es tablishments. The following comparative Statistical tables are appended:( 11 ) DISTRICT POLICE. 1872. 1873.

Inspected the Dispensary on the 24th April 1874, found every thing in good order. As stated in the Report for 1872, the charitable portion of this Dispensary was made over to the Bulrampur Hospital, on the 31st of March of that year, since which time there have been no in-door patients, and the out-door patients have been principally the public and private servants of the Civil community who subscribe to this institution.
( 12 ) Here also are dispensed the prescriptions of the covenanted and uncovenanted officers of Government. The daily average number of out-patients are about 30. First Class Hospital Assistant Shekh Deedar Bux maintains the high character he has long held lor ability and invariable good conduct. Native Medical Pupil Sumbhoo Nath has not been an attentive as he might be to his duties. He frequently absents himself on the plea of sickness and I fear does not bear a very good character. He has simply learnt nothing in Materia Medica or Pharmacy, during the 10 months he has been attached to this Dispensary. Doctor Whishaw states the lad has no taste for education. 1872. 1873.

( 13 ) The Jail Hospital in a close and badly ventilated building, but I hear the present arrangements are temporary, and that an soon as the new Hawalat is built the proper Jail Hospital, which in now utilised for that purpose, will be re-occupied by the sick under treatment. Out of a strength of 301 prisoners there were only 6 slight cases in hospital. Third Class Hospital Assistant Abdool Samud has a good know ledge of English, and in well reported of by Dr. Selous. POLICE HOSPITAL. In the Police Hospital there were 9 trifling cases under treatment to an average stength of 455 men, also a sepoy of the 16th Native Infan- try suffering from Hemiplegia and as the man has exceeded his leave, and his case in probably incurable, the circumstance should al once be reported to his Commanding Officer. The building and instruments are clean and in good order, and all the records up to date. SADR DISPENSARY. The Sadr Dispensary is a commodious suitable building, and everything in excellent order, the records neatly kept and up to date. The daily average attendance of out patients is 49.00, house patients There were 10 cases under treatment on the occasion of my visit. First Class Hospital Assistant Sheikh Mohomed Bux is a very superior man, be is attentive and trust worthy and well qualified in Eng- lish, and a great favorite with the officials. The two Medical Pupils Muzrooddeen and Mahomed Altaf Rassool are lads of good character, but are reported to have made little progress during the last three months. On putting a few questions I found them to be utterly ignorant of the most elementary knowledge of dispensing or Materia Medica.

BARA BANKI SADR DISPENSARY. Dr. Franklin has been in medical charge since October 1872. The marked improvement in all points in the Dispensary during 1873 is very gratifying, and which is entirely due to his methodical arrangements and ability. It will be observed on reference to the subjoined comparative state- ment that the admissions of out and in-door patients are doubled, that the capital operations have increased from 2 in 1872, to 47 in 1873, and the minor operations from 76 to 251. First Class Hospital Assistant Shaikh Hingin has been in medical charge since the 2nd September, is an intelligent and well conducted man, speaks and writes English fluently, and has very good knowledge of his profession. Medical Pupil Mirza Soobhan Beg is reported of good character, but is idle and inattentive, and has made very little progress. Medical Pupil Wazeer Alí is reported in the nominal disposition roll for December 1873, as idle and inattentive, and a bad character, but Dr. Franklin states he has only had cause to find fault with him once, and that his backwardness is more owing to want of ability than disinclination to work.

'' There are at present two Medical Pupils attached to the dispensary, Budhawa Singh and Ismael Khán : one, Budhawa Singh, is attentive and of good conduct. Neither the conduct nor the attention of the other, Ismael Khán has been satisfactory. "Returns of the Mahmúdabad branch dispensary accompany this report.This branch dispensary is supported by the Seetapoor dispensary fund or from" Local Fund," at least it has no fund of its own.The Hos- pital Assistant in charge of the dispensary has been changed during the year,and I believe the change is likely to be advantageous.
( 24 ) The following comparative statement is submitted :( 25 ) "The Sadr dispensary is visited daily. "First Class Hospital Assistant Lala Rámsahoi was in charge of the Sadr dispensary up to the end of March, when he was relieved by second Class Hospital Assistant Rajab Khán who was transferred here from Unáo. Rajab Khán has conducted himself entirely to my satisfaction, his professional knowledge is above the average, he speaks and writes English very well, and is kind and attentive to the sick under his care, " Second Class Hospital Assistant Jehangeer Khán has been in charge of the Branch dispensary at Mohumdi throughout the year. He is an intelli- gent well conducted man, with a very fair professional knowledge, and speaks and writes English very well. "Second Class Hospital Assistant Karamut Husein has been in charge of the Branch dispensary at Gola throughout the year. His professional knowledge is inferior, he speaks and writes English very badly, his con- duct has been good. State of repair, additions alterations, &c. "All the dispensaries are in a good state of repair. The Hospital for males at the Sadr was completely re-roofed in 1872. The Female Hos- pital was condemned and a new one on a different plan is being built; a new house for the Hospital Assistant in charge has been built and new cook-house, latrine and servants' quarters are in course of erection. A pakka well has been constructed in the dispensary compound. Fittings. "The medicines and instruments are kept in Almirahs which are in good order. New durrís, blankets and charpoys were supplied to the three dispensaries during the year. Medicines, & c., "The supply of Europe and Native medicines was good and suffi- cient. In May last 74 lbs. of quinine were purchased for the use of the district, so there has been no want of this valuable drug. The instruments have been kept in good repair, are serviceable and sufficient. Attendance. "The dispensaries have been well attended during the year. There is a slight decrease in out door attendance at the Branch dispensaries compared with 1872, but this is only consistent with the fact that 1872 was the more unhealthy year of the two.

( 26 ) " The Branch dispensaries with a greater number of admissions have a smaller daily average number of in-door patients than the Sadr. This is in consequence no doubt of the patients losing patience and remain- ing but a short time in hospital. At the Sadr there is more inducement to stay until cured. Operations. "The operation for Lithotomy was performed three times during the year, all the cases were successful and had a speedy convalescence; one of the men operated on came all the way from Nepal, he was out of bed cured on the tenth day. Amputation of the leg was performed for Necrosis of the Tibia and the case did very well, the man improved remarkably in general health after the operation. Amputation of the forearm was performed for cancerous tumuor of the hand, the case pro- gressed very favorably and the stump was healing kindly but the man insisted on returning to his home before he was quite recovered, and the result was that he came back three months afterwards with the disease returned in the stump and with hardened ascillary and subclairan glands. Six dislocations were successfully reduced. The operation for Phimosis was performed three times, and a tumour the size of an orange was re- moved from the right supra-orbital region. Prevailing diseases. " Malarious Fever has been very prevalent; 87 per cent. of the entire number of deaths during the year are attributed to it. Cholera was present in the district from March to September; 1073 persons were attacked by the disease and 510 died, or under 50 per cent, so that the epidemic cannot be considered to have been a very serious one. Special reports concerning it have been submitted to the Deputy Surgeon Gene- ral. Funds. " The subscriptions from Natives to the dispensaries have fallen off this year, not from any ill feeling towards these institutions, but from a general inability to pay anything, and it was necessary in November to ask the Deputy Commissoner for funds from other sources to meet expenses. A sum of over Rs. 500 was then put to the credit of the dis- pensary fund. " The following is a statement of receipts and expenditure :( 27 ) KHERI SADR DISPEN- SARY. 1872. 1873.

" In compliance with the request of the Commissioner. I have the honor to submit a brief report concerning the nineteen cases of cholera, which I treated by the Hypodermic Injection of Chloral Hydrate. The solution used was of an uniform strength throughout, and contained one part of the medicine to ten of water. 2. " On the 9th of last month, news was received that cholera had broken out in the village Chaoneh about a mile from the Sadr, two deaths had already occurred. I arrived at the village at 5 o'clock P. M. and found five persons ill, one of whom, a Bhargin, died just as I entered her house; of the others, two were in severe and two in mild collapse when the treat- ment was begun( 31 ) " The injections were made in the arms and thighs, the Canula of the Syringe being plunged pretty deeply into the flesh. The greatest quantity of Chloral used in any of my cases was sixteen grains or eight injections ; if the case was a bad one four injections were made at once, then nothing was done for an hour, when the treatment was repeated if necessary ; as a rule sleep was induced within two hours, nothing else was done except mulling the limbs and giving occasionally some cold boiled water. 4. " There is no necessary for me to say much as to the rationale of the treatment. Surgeon Hall R. A., the originator, has made it public. Chloral Hydrate being a powerful sedative soothes the irritated nerves, and so relaxes the contracted vessels, the blood is once more uniformly distributed and consequently the pulse re-appears at the wrist, the cramps and burning abdominal pains subside, sleep is induced, the respiration be- comes regular, the discharges lessen, the face fills out, the voice becomes stronger and the natural secretions are restored. " I sincerely hope that this form of treatment of cholera will be given an extensive trial.'' Copy of Doctor Hall's letter dated 18th October 1873, to Commissioner of Seetapoor. "In compliance with your request I have the honor to make the fol- lowing statement, on the subject of the treatment of Cholera by the Hy- podermic Injection of Chloral Hydrate. 1. "In May 1869 I wrote a paper, entitiled "Thoughts about Cholera" which was published in " The Indian Annals of Medical Science'' for March 1870, No. XXVI. In that paper I advanced a theory, that in the cold stage, or collapse of Cholera, instead of exhaustion of the nervous sys- tem (as was generally supposed) there is intense irritation of certain sets of nerves; and I suggested that the principle which should guide us in the treatment of this condition, was the endeavour to get the nervous system quieted by the action of pure sedatives ; not to give stimulants, as was very frequently done. I pointed out that it was of little use giving medi- cines by the mouth, on account of the frequent vomiting; and I recom- mended the practice of the hypodermic injection of sedatives in the state of collapse. 2. "When I wrote, Chloral Hydrate had only recently been discover- in Germany. I had never used it, and was not aware of its true action on the nervous system. Last August twelve months, Surgeon Major collis of the Buffs and myself conducted a series of experiments on large "frogs, to ascertain the action of numerous drugs on the heart and nerves. We found that Chloral Hydrate is one of the most powerful sedatives that we possess. 3. "On the 21st August last a soldier of "the Buffs" was admitted into Hospital at this Station sufferring from Cholera. Surgeon Major Collis kindly placed him under my care, as he knew that I was anxious to treat a case, not having had an opportunity of doing so for nearly four
( 32 ) years. When I saw the patient he was in collapse. I dissolved (10) ten grains of Chloral Hydrate in (100) one hundred drops of water and inject- ed this quantity subcutaneously in four different places in the arms. The effect was most satisfactory, reaction being completely established in about 5 hours. The man recovered without any bad symptoms, and there were no signs of ulceration where the solution had been injected. 4. "I mentioned the result to Dr. Higginson, Civil Surgeon of Kheri, Oudb, (among others) and he said he would try this plan if he had an op- portunity. He has done so, and the report he has furnished shews the success of it. Statistics will show that no other plan of treatment hither- to adopted has been followed by so many cures. 5. " I attach great importance to the strength of the solution used, (1 part in 10 of water) if it is too strong, it probably will not absorbed into the blood, and only cause ulceration or sloughing. 6. " The following is the plan of treatment that I recommend for the three stages of Cholera. During the premonitory diarrh( 33 ) HARDUI SADR DISPENSARY. Dr. R. D. Logg in Medical Charge.

Reports to the effect have been made to the authorities and a thorough repair of the roof is under contemplation. " The Dispensary affords comfortable accommodation to 24 males and 17 female in-patients in separate wards. Two cells exist in which insane patients are kept pending transfer to Lucknow Asylum. " The ventilation of the Dispensary is quite free on account of its elevated position and open surroundings. The drainage is perfect, from the fact of the ground having a natural slope outwards. The latrines are worked on the dry earth system and cleanliness within and around the Dispensary is insisted on. The water of one well of the Dispensary formerly used for drinking purposes has become brackish. Water is now obtained from another well close by. " During the period under review 7582 patients applied for relief at the Dispensary. Of these 368 were in-door and 7,214 out-door pa- tients. The figures are almost equal to those of 1872. Out-door pa- tients were attended to at all hours of the day, and many were not en- tered in the Dispensary Register in July and August owing to stress of work in connection with cholera in the city. In-door patients were housed, fed and supplied with clothing and bedding, the latter consisting of a wooden charpoy, grass mat, strip of taut, a durie and two blankets. " Attendance at the Dispensary during 1873, was as usual chiefly oc- casioned by Fevers mostly of Intermittent type, Rheumatism, Bronchitis and Bowel complaints resulting from exposure to wet and cold in most instances. " An epidemic of cholera raged in the district during last year and extended to the Town from villages distant 12 and 16 miles south east in the middle of July. The disease was of virulent type and occasioned 230 deaths in 368 attacks during July and August. The percentage of deaths to attacks was 62.50 and to population 3.24. Chloral Hydrate was used internally in the treatment of a few cases of this disease. The medicine allayed restlessness and rendered the patient drowsy but no other beneficial effects resulted from the drug. " There were 40 casualties in the Dispensary last year : 2 from remit- tent fever, 10 from cholera, 3 from leprosy, 1 from phthisis pulmonalis, 1 from mania, 1 from pnuemonia, 2 from dysentry, 4 from diarrh( 39 ) " Of the 20 capital operations 2 only ended fatally. The first fatal case was after secondary amputation of the right thigh just above the knee joint for compound comminuted fracture of both bones of the leg. The subject of this operation died from shock after 3 days. The second fatal case happened after perineal section for retention and extravasation of urine the result of stricture.

Not having been able to visit this District I give the subjoined extracts from Dr. Cameron's report, from which it will be seen there has been for some time a gradual and consi- derable falling off in the attendance of both the in-door and out-door patients, which he attributes to the removal of an old and popular Native Doctor, some two years ago. Site. " The situation of the Dispensary has often been described in previous Reports. Buildings. " The buildings also were described in last year's Report. No additions were made during the year except the building of a latrine and of a verandah to the dead house, but the roofs of all the buildings were extensively repaired. Another latrine is wanted and will be provided during the current year. Bedding. " A quantity of bedding was purchased during the year at a cost of Rs. 75, and the Dispensary is now tolerably well provided in this respect. Furniture. " An almirah to hold medicines was bought and the purchase of a proper operating table has been sanctioned by the Committee. Medicines and Instru- ments. " Owing to the more punctual supply of the yearly indent there was no inconvenience experienced, such as was complained of last year
( 41 ) with regard to medicines. The instruments are many of them old and by no means the best of their kind but they are usually sufficient for the work they are required to do. Finances. " The Dispensary possesses no Fund and is dependent for sup- port on private subscriptions and donations, supplemented by a grant from Local Funds. This year I am glad to be able to report a large in- crease of subscriptions, the hope expressed last year that they might be raised to at least Rs. 30 per mensem being more than realised. Subscriptions. Donations. "The total amount of private subscriptions was Rs. 453-3, against Rs. 272 in the previous year. Of this rather more than a third was subscribed by natives and the rest by Europeans. The Municipality made two separate donations amounting to Rs. 325. Attendance of Patients. " The total number of patients admitted to treatment during the year was 3,811, of whom 278 were in-door and 3,533 out-door. The fol- lowing statement gives the numbers for the last four years.

I am not aware that the district has been so much healthier during the last 2 years as to account for it in any degree. Possibly it may be owing in part to the multipli- cation of dispensaries in neighbouring districts and, this year, to the establishment of 2 branches in this district itself. However this may be the attendance must to a great extent depend on the ability and kindness of the Native Doctor in charge, and I trust as the present incumbent becomes better known the attendance may revive. Operations "The number of capital operations was 16 and of minor opera- tions 161. " The capital operations were for the extraction of stone 8, removal of tumors 2, extraction of eyeball 1, tapping of abdomen 2, and reduc- tion of dislocation 3. One of the lithotomy cases died and one of the tumor cases. The rest did well. "The minor operations were tapping of hydrocele, opening abscesses &c., none of the operations presented any features of great or unusual interest. Conduct of Native Docter ''First Class Hospital Assistant Bhyro Pershad Patuck was in charge of the hospital during the year. He is well qualified profes- sionally and was active and attentive to his work. "The rest of the establishment also did their work satisfactorily.

Only out-door cases have been treated at either place no hospital having as yet been built.
( 43 ) Attendance. " From the numbers that appear to have sought for relief during the short time these dispensaries have been open it appears likely they will do much good. During the 3 months, 1275 patients were treated at Musafirkhana, and 668 at Kadipur. I have visited the former twice and the latter once since they were opened, and I had every reason to think the attendance was correctly represented in the books.

( 46 ) " Remarks regarding the conduct and qualifications of the Hospital Assistant :( 47 ) BEHAR BRANCH DISPENSARY IN PRATÁBGARH. Opened in November 1872. The following statistical return for 1873 is added :( 48 ) states the European subscriptions are easily collected, not so those of the native residents, several of whom have intimated their unwillingness to continue their contributions, in fact look upon the new local cess to cover their obligations towards the dispensary, &c., but as the local rates committee have contributed largely, the funds of the dispensary are in a flourishing condition. The following statistical tables are added :( 49 ) " The establishment has hitherto consisted of a Hospital Assistant and compounder : the occasional services of bhístí and sweeper having been obtained for a small monthly payment. It will be necessary, how- ever to entertain these menial servants permanently in the ordinary way, as the economical arrangement is found to be extremely inconve- nient and unsatisfactory. " The income of the dispensary was derived, as in the cases of the other branch dispensaries, from the sources, viz., local rates and private subscriptions. The subscriptions have fallen from Rs. 228-7-9 to Rs. 96-12-0 and it is extremely likely will fail altogether in the coming year. The local rates grant will, however, no doubt be sufficient for all purposes. " The expenditure during the year was slightly in excess of the receipts, but as there was a balance in favor of the dispensary at the commencement of the year, which more than covered the excess, there still remained a balance to the good at the close of the year, as will be seen from Return No. 1. "The number treated in-door and out-door were 114 and 4,374 respectively against 54 and 3,577 in 11 months in 1872. Making due allowance for the month of January in 1872 the results of the past year show an increase in the number that have sought relief. The increase appears to be attributable to the growing popularity of the dispensary, rather than to an increase of sickness among the population, for the year has been a healthy one. "The daily average attendance was in-door 7.09, out-door 59.13 against 5 and 63.30 respectively in 1872. The decrease in the daily average attendance of out-door patients taken in connection with the increase of cases for the year shows either that the diseases were of a milder character requiring less treatment or that they yielded quicker to treatment. As regards the increase of in-door patients it is difficult to avoid admitting individuals who are as much in need of food as of medi- cine and who, in fact, would, in England, be sent to a poor-house instead of a hospital. " The diseases treated both in-door and out of door were as usual chiefly agues, rheumatism, bowel complaints and skin diseases, the scourges of the poor. The last named (skin diseases) in the case of the out-door predominating over all others. "The Return (No. 3) shows only 31 deaths known to have occurred among out-door patients. This, I need hardly say is necessarily unreli- able. Among the in-door 9 deaths occurred or nearly 5 per cent. of the total treated. Nearly 50 per cent. of the mortality was from bowel com- plaints in old and worn-out persons ; chiefly mendicants.
( 50 ) " Six major operations and 174 minor operations were performed. " The major operations were, Eye, ... ... ... ... 1 Amputation, ... ... ... ... 5 6 all of which made good recoveries. " The minor operations were such as occur in the every-day practice of a dispensary and need not to be detailed. " The success of the dispensary as shown by the increase in the out-door attendance is very satisfactory. Salubrity of the town and suburbs. " Small-pox was rather prevalent both in the town and neighbor- hood towards the commencement of the hot weather but disappeared at once on the setting in of the rains. A few cases of cholera, or cholerine, of a mild form occurred throughout the year. On the whole, this part of the district was unusually healthy in the past year. " Hospital Assistant Bhowany Singh, formerly attached to the Bulrampur hospital at Lucknow, exchanged appointments with Hospital Assistant Brindabun Dass and took over charge in November last. I have had little opportunity of judging of his conduct and qualifications but as far as I have observed both are satisfactory. The following statement is added :( 51 ) Disbursements. 1872. 1873.

SHAHGANJ BRANCH DISPENSARY IN FYZABAD. The following is Doctor J. Cameron's Report:( 52 ) control of expenditure under this head. Patients, when known to be able to do so, are required to provide themselves with food at their own ex- pense, but it is not always easy to discriminate between the necessitous and the well to do. " The income of the dispensary, exclusive of what is supplied from Provincial Revenues, is derived from two sources viz: local rates, and private subscriptions. As regards, the latter, I am sorry to have to report that they are realised with much difficulty, all being grudgingly given. Not but that the landowners think the dispensary a highly de- sireable institution and well meriting their support, but because their burdens are, they say, already as heavy as they can bear. This source of income therefore cannot be depended on in the current year. And in- deed, for all the subscriptions add to the income of the dispensary it is hardly worth our while to perpetuate the odium of what is certainly regarded by the "donors" as an additional tax imposed upon them without the sanction of Government. " At my periodical inspections I have always found the dispensary and hospital clean and neat, the medicines well arranged and neatly labelled, the instruments well cared for, and the records well kept, and written up to date. " Hospital Assistant Gumandí Láll has been in charge ever since the opening of the dispensary. He has the confidence of the people far and wide, and is in every respect a thoroughly good officer and well deserving man. Surgical operations. 1872. 1873.

Dr. J. Cameron submits the following Report :( 54 ) " The great increase of out-door patients show, if the returns are correct, that the Dispensary is supplying a want which must have been long and sorely felt by the poor fever stricken people here. " Peer Khán, Second Class Hospital Assistant, has been in charge since the opening of the Dispensary. He appears to have gained the good opinion and confidence of the people. I regret however to have to state that he is slovenly, and irregular and dilatory in the preparation and submission of his returns ; shortcomings which he ascribes to his frequent illness, but which I believe are due to his imperfect knowledge of the English language. The following statement is added :( 55 ) GONDA SADR DISPENSARY. " The position &c., of the Sadr Dispensary has been described in pre- vious reports. The roof of the building is in a very bad condition ; Rs. 6,000 have been allotted in next year's Budget for the repair and the work will be commenced in the beginning of the financial year. The women's hospital is also in a bad state of repair : this will also be remedied. " The number of patients admitted during the year was 274, the out- door patients numbered 9364. " The expenditure of the Sadr Dispensary amounted during the year to Rs.2,545-14-0. The different items are Establishment Rs. 1,296, Dieting in-door patients Rs. 249-1-3, Bazaar Medicines Rs. 204-5-0, Contin- gencies Rs. 796-7-9. The. receipts were European Subscriptions Rs. 205. Native subscriptions Rs. 477-1-0,Government Allowance Rs. 1,296,Other Sources Rs. 796-7-9. The bill for European Medicines, which is now paid from Local Funds, has not been received from the Examiner of Me- dical Accounts. Health. '' The cost of dieting each in-door patient was 9 pies. "The past year when compared with 1872 has been a healthy one. Sporadic cases of cholera occurred during the months of June, July, Au- gust, and September in the north part of the district. Food was also very expensive during the latter part of the year but has not been, I am glad to say, attended with increased sickness. Type of Disease. " The largest admissions into Hospital were from general dropsy com- bined with enlargement of spleen or liver, consequent on malarious fever. Those cases I found most unsatisfactory to treat, the patients do not generally present themselves for treatment until the disease has well established itself. Some bad cases of constitutional syphilis were also treated. "This district is remarkable for the prevalence of goitre, and is only to be found in villages close to the bank of the Terhee and Gogra rivers. " During the year 1873, no fewer than 3655 cases of this disease were treated. The application of the ointment of the Biniodide of Mercury was the treatment : it proved very efficacious. This ointment is well known in goitrous villages. Large numbers suffering fron skin-disease also at- tended. The principal forms were scabies and herpes. Surgical cases. '' Several kinds of injuries have been treated. Fractures and injuries to head are of very common occurrence. Seven operations for stone were performed, all successful. One was a recurrent calculus ; this man was operated on 7 years ago by Dr. Condon, the stone lately removed seemed to be a quite new formation. Two operations of the leg lower third, one traumatic gangrene, second cancrous tumour, both proved successful and were supplied with crutches. ''One case of penetrating wound of the abdomen with protrusion in which the wound had to be enlarged to return the intestines succumbed to peritonitis after 4 days. Medicines. Indigenous medicines are largely used.
( 56 ) " Third Grade Assistant Surgeon Jadub Kristo Sen has been in charge during the year. He is a most intelligent officer, and attentive to his duties. He has operated on some stone cases remarkably well. "The compounder and dresser are trustworthy men and attentive to their duties. The latter has been attached to this Dispensary for years and bears a good character. " The Medical pupils are very attentive at the Hospital and also at school. Surgical operations. 1872. 1873.

Dr. Cromarty in his Annual report makes the following remarks regarding the site, building and ventilation of the present Dispensary :( 59 ) own senses but from the behaviour of sores and injuries of in-door patients under treatment, so that lately it has found necessary for the successful treatment of severe surgical operations to place the cases in tents out- side the Hospital." I beg to observe that the Chief Commissioner, Commissioner and local civil authorities do not concur in the above remarks, and have recorded opinions that the building was convenient and well adapted for Hospital purposes, though it would be desirable to annex the remainder of the old premises now occupied by the Police. The Commissioner, Mr. Capper, hopes that arrangements to this end may be made in the course of this year, but meanwhile the site and plans of the new building have been disapproved and the Hospital will remain where it is for the present. I can only remark that if the floors and foundations, as stated by Dr. Cro- marty, are saturated with impurities and morbid matter of bye gone years so as to render the Hospital positively unhealthy it does not reflect much credit on the management. It will be observed in another subjoined extract concluding Dr. Cro- marty's report that he has thought fit to impose on Assistant Surgeon Nund Lall Banerjee, in Medical charge of the Sadr Dispensary and Leper Institution, extra duties, which in no way come within his province to perform, such as copying Civil Surgeon's dockets, Medico-legal reports, and Branch Dispensary returns, which have no reference whatever to the insti- tutions over which the Assistant Surgeon has charge. It is nothing more or less than converting him into a private clerk for which the Civil Sur- geon should in my opinion make his own arrangements in the absence of a writer being sanctioned by Government, and not monopolize the leisure hours of his subordinate. Dr. Cromarty further reports that Assistant Surgeon Nund Lall Banerjee joined this his first appointment to the service in February last. His duties throughout year have been of an arduous nature : he has not only had Assistant charge of the Bharaich Leper Hospital, as well as to supervise the dieting, clothing and treatment of the Dispensary sick, but also has performed the duty of keeping the Medical records and accounts of the Dispensary besides those of the four district Branch Institutions. '' In addition he has (as I have no Hospital or Office Clerk allowed me)been compelled to make fair copies of all my dockets and reports Medico- legal, monthly, quarterly, and half yearly mortuary returns, and Medical indents, to say nothing of a large and miscellaneous correspondence besides. " All this clerical work has of necessity curtailed his utility as my professional Assistant, and has also trenched seriously on those few leisure hours which should have been devoted by him to the improvement of his Medical knowledge. To obviate this difficulty I would respectfully beg to refer the authorities to Medical Circular No. 13 dated Fort William April 1873, and by virtue of the orders therein contained, to ask for
( 60 ) the services of a paid clerk. The Circular referred to fully recognises and supplies this want on the part of Civil Surgeons." Hissampur. Bhinga. Nanpara. Ekowna. Dr. Cromarty adds a note to his report that the Reports on the Branch Dispensaries noted in the margin* will be subsequently submitted, but as it is now the 3rd May and they have not reached this office I can await their arrival no longer. The following comparative statement furnished with Dr. Cromarty's Annual Report for 1873 is added shewing the cost of in-door patients diet at Rs. 1-3-9 he also quotes the expenditure under this head for 1872 at Rs. 0-14-0, whereas in the printed report for that year it is given at Rs. 0-1-2, but omits to state whether the above means one per mensem or diem. So much time has already been lost in awaiting the arrival of his Annual papers and returning them for correction that I must submit them with these discrepancies to be explained hereafter.

( 61 ) BRANCH DISPENSARIES IN BHARAICH. The following is Dr. Cromarty's Report on the Branch Dispensaries, submitted to this office on the 13 th May :( 62 ) "With regard to the conduct and qualification of the Hospital Assistant Sheorutton Doss, I can say no more than that he continues to justify the satisfactory terms in which I have from time to time spoken of him in the Quarterly Disposition Returns of the past year. He is active and intelligent, enjoys the confidence of the people, and appears to do his best to further the popularity and usefulness of the Institution. NANPARAH. "This Dispensary, which is of the 3rd Class, was opened to the public on the 10th July 1873 ; it has no building of its own at present, and consequently no accommodation for in-door patients. A new pakka building is about to be constructed; meantime the business of the Insti- tution is conducted at the Public "Serrai" and although so recently opened, it already appears to be growing in popular favor; and as the result of my three visits of inspection, I am personally in a position to say that the Dispensary is well resorted to, and a glance at the following figures, for the accuracy of which I can vouch, will I think afford a suffi- cient proof that its benefits are highly appreciated :( 63 ) ber of sick applicants, thus giving sufficient proof of the estimation in which the charity is held by the surrounding population. The following return shows the real amount of epidemic disease. The Hospital accom- modation is still temporary, but arrangements are now in hand to obviate this inconvenience. The transactions of the period under notice are the following:( 64 ) Out-door Patients admitted during the year 1873, ... 719 Cured and relieved, ... ... ... ... ... 617 Ceased to attend, ... ... ... ... ... 91 Died, ... ... ... ... ... ... 3 Remaining, ... ... ... ... ... 8 Total, ... ... 719 Surgical operations.

" The extensive prevalence of disease in this part of the Province in the shape of fevers, cholera, small pox, and from the fact alone that 9,276 deaths occurred in 1873, the result of the first mentioned complaint, confirms me in the opinion that nothing short of three additional Dispen- saries will adequately meet the wants of this district." BULRAMPUR MEDICAL SCHOOL IN LUCKNOW. The following is a short History and report of the Bulrampur Me- dical School, Lucknow :( 65 ) RULES. Rules. 1st( 66 ) 9. " There will be two months vacation in each year, at the end the session, in order that the students may return to their 'homes read up the subjects of the session.

" Each successful candidate before being admitted to a scholar ship will be required to sign the following agreement on stamped paper of the Pargannah in Oudh agree to study Medicine and Surgery at the Bulrampur Medical School Lucknow and to conform to the rules of the Institution for three years. If I leave the Medical School without the permission of the Principal, or if I fail to return at the end of each vacation, I promise to refund the whole of the money paid to me on account of my scholarship, as well as return any books which may have been lent to me." Meeting of Committee. MEETING OF MEDICAL MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE BULRAMPUR MEDICAL SCHOOL-26TH JANUARY, 1874. PRESENT, DEPUTY SURGEON GENERAL CANNON, SURGEON MAJOR WHISHAW. 1. " Proposed that the period of study in the school be from the 1st July to 30th April. " That the first six months of this period, corresponding to the winter session in the English Medical School be devoted to the following sub- ject:( 67 ) ANNUAL REPORT ON THE BULARAMPUR MEDICAL SCHOOL, LUCKNOW FOR THE YEAR ENDING 31ST DECEMBER 1873, BY THE PRINCIPAL, SURGEON MAJOR BONAVIA. Annual Report . " The School was opened by Sir George Couper, Chief Commissioner of Oudh, on the 12th April 1873. 2. " It is affiliated to the Bulrámpur Hospital and is supported by Sir Dirigbijay Singh Maharajah of Bulrámpur, who gives Rs. 10,000 per annum for it. 3. " Thirty scholarships are given to natives of Oudh, of Rs. 5 per month each. Two are given by each district and six. by the Municipality of Lucknow. 4. " At the commencement of the current session a preliminary ex- amination in English, Urdu and Arithmetic was held of the Candidates who presented themselves for scholarships, and those who were qualified were admitted. 5. " Of the candidates who presented themselves for admission only 27 were found qualified. From some of the districts such as Kheri, Pratábgarh, Sultánpur Bharaich and Seetapoor no candidates were sent, and from Gonda only one was sent, either because none were found quali- fied or because none at that time cared to take up the medical profession. 6. "Under these circumstances some districts who had not sent any candidates agreed to accept candidates from the superfluous ones of other districts. Even with this arrangement all the 30 scholarships could not be filled up, as only 27 were qualified for admission. 7. " Of the 27 Candidates who were admitted to the scholarships :( 68 ) 9. "The staff of the school consists of a Principal, Surgeon Major E. Bonavia, M. D. and three Assistant Surgeons, Bábu Chandí Charn Ghose, Bábú Nobin Chander Mitter and Bábú Ishán Chander Roy. 10. " The work of the school commenced on 14th April. During the first year as there was plenty of time, lectures were given fully on the following snbjects : Dr. Bonavia, ... Botany and Zoology. Bábú Chandí Charn Ghose, ... Materia Medica. Bábú Nobin Chander Mitter, ... Physics and Chemistry. Bábú Ishán Chander Roy, ... Anatomy. The text books used were English text books. 11. "Frequent oral examinations were held, and once a month a written examination was held in order that the students might be classi- fied, and to ascertain what progress they were making. 12. " Dissections were commenced on the 15 th October and up to the 31st December, 18 bodies were dissected. These were supplied from the unclaimed bodies of the Bulrámpur Hospital. The Civil Surgeon has kindly allowed the bodies of the King's Hospital and Lunatic Asylum also to be utilized for dissection, when any are unclaimed, 13. "A small chemical apparatus and a few instruments for experi- ments in Physics have been purchased from England for the use of the school, as well as a collection of drugs to serve as specimens. But the school, for want of sufficient funds, is at present very imperfectly supplied with diagrams and books for the use of the Professors. 14. " For the future the Managing Committee have decided that the session should commence on the 1st of July and end on 30th April, leav- ing two months for vacation, and that all the subjects to be gone through during the curriculum, should be lectured upon every year as follows:( 69 ) 16. " The system of selecting candidates from the various districts did not work well last year. In various districts no suitable candidates could be found, and, in some instances, I had great difficulty in persuading the Local Committees to accept candidates from other districts ; with all this trouble I could not get the 30 scholarships filled up. I think matters would be simplified if several candidates were to be sent from each dis- trict, and two selected, by examination in Lucknow, from those of each district. If no suitable candidates can be found in any particular district, that district should, in my opinion, as a matter of course, accept candi- dates from other districts. After all, they will be natives of Oudh, and with roads and railways one district is not far from another." H. M. CANNON, M. B., Deputy Surgeon General, Indian Medical Service, Lucknow Circle.

DiarrhREPORT ON DISPENSARIES IN THE PROVINCE OF OUDH, FOR THE YEAR 1874 LUCKNOW :No. 2830. FROM THE OFFG. SECY. TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, OUDH, To THE DEPUTY SURGEON GENERAL INDIAN MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. Dated Lucknow, the 15th June 1875. GENERAL DEPARTMENT. SIR, I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No, 572/CC dated the 17th April, reporting on the working of the several hospitals and charitable dispensaries in Oudh during the year 1874. 2. Your own report this year is brief, consisting of 21 paragraphs; but with it you have submitted an appendix of 386 paragraphs, containing extracts from your own inspection reports and from the annual reports of the civil medical officers, and some general remarks. The Officiating Chief Commissioner does not altogether approve of this plan. It is not always easy to see whether the remarks are yours or the Civil Surgeon's, and a good deal of unnecessary matter has been printed. To take, for example, the Lucknow Lunatic Asylum; paras. 17, 18, 19, 21,22, 23, 24, and part of 26, are not wanted. With regard to paras. 17, 18, and 19, it is unnecessary in an annual report to state on what day you visited the asylum, or to record the number of inmates and state of clothing on that particular date. The same remarks apply to paras. 21, 22, 23, 24, and part of 26, with even greater force, for in a report regarding the year 1874, there is no object to be gained by stating that there were 140 lunatics on the 12th January 1875. Paras 7 to 10 3. The Officiating Chief Commissioner notes that considerable im- provement is shown in the progress of the medical pupils. You think that much may still be done, and civil medical officers will, no doubt. endeavour to carry out your instructions. Para 13. Para 15. 4. Four new Branch Dispensaries were opened during the year, and though the number of persons treated increased by 19,256, the number of ascertained deaths fell by 380, the figures being 1,075 in 1873, and 695 in the year under review. These last statistics are of little value, for there is no trustworthy record showing deaths of out-door patients. Turning to the various statements, the Officiating Chief Commissioner finds that of the out-door patients attending the Balrámpur Hospital, 40 are said to have died (and this appears to be a mistake, vide para. 12). In the returns for the Sadr Dispensaries of Sitapur, Hardoi, and Gonda, out-door are not distinguished from in-door patients. Of the out-door patients who visited the Sadr Dispensaries of Unao, Sultanpur, and Partabgarh, seven are said to have died; while of those who attended the King's Hospital and the remaining live Sadr Dispensaries, not a single death has been recorded.
( 2 ) Para 16. 5. A reference to pavas. 88 and 105 of your notes will show that these papers do not always show how many of the capital operations proved successful. Para 17. 6. In the matter of accounts there is a considerable difference be- tween the opening balance of 1874 and the closing balance of 1873, as will be seen from the following figures, which are taken from the returns No. 1 for 1873 and 1874 :( 3 ) 10. The death rate is very high. It has risen from 16.14 per cent. on the average strength to 20.07 ; or, taking the percentage on the total number under treatment, from 10 to something less than 13. The deaths were most frequent among the females : out of a total number of 62 no less than 15 died, while of 165 men only 13 died. Of the patients who died, 6 men and 8 women had been in the asylum for less than one year. 11. The very high death rate at this institution has been the subject of correspondence during the past year, and you have expressed your opinion that it is not owing to the unhealthiness of the site. The fact, however, remains that the rate is double what it should be, taking the rate at other lunatic asylums as a criterion. This you do not attempt to account for, but I am to bring the subject to your notice, and to point out that this great mortality calls for your earnest attention ; at present matters are anything but satisfactory. Balrámpur Hospital. Para. 34. Para. 38. 12. The Balrámpur Hospital has, on the whole, had the greatest number of patients on its books, namely 10,161, but it is closely followed by the Partabgarh Sadr Dispensary with 10,053. 718 were in, and the remainder out-door patients. The number of capital operations appears from the return to have been 26. According to the return there were no in-door patients at the close or at the beginning of the year, although the daily average throughout the year was 47.97 ; but this is evidently a mistake, and the figures 48 and 40, which in the statement show the num- ber of out-patients who died, should be opposite " remaining in-door patients." Para 61. 13. The attention of the Inspector General of Police will be invited to your remarks on the dead-house at the Police Hospital. The Officiat- ing Chief Commissioner wishes you had brought the matter to notice in January instead of waiting till your annual report was written. Para. 132-138. 14. The Sitapur Dispensary has been attended by more patients than during the preceding year, but it is still to be regretted that this institution has not become more popular. Para. 142-144 15. The numbers 1,856 and 2,506 given in para. 142 of your report, appear to include in-door as well as out-door patients. Para. 163. 16. The figures in the return following para. 163 do not agree with those in Statement I. According to the latter, the total receipts in Hardoi amounted to Rs. 4,687-4-8, but in the return, at page 32, the receipts are said to have been Rs 6,216-14-5. In the expenditure, too, there is a difference of Rs. 1,520-9-9. Para. 181-187. 17. The Officiating Chief Commissioner is sorry to hear so bad an account of the Fyzabad Dispensary building, but trusts means will be found to repair the roof. In the comparative statement the figures for 1873 have been given under 1874, and those for 1874 under the heading 1873. A similar mistake has been made with regard to the Rae Bareli Dispensary, para. 304, and the Sultanpur Dispensary, para. 314.
( 4 ) Para. 210. 18. The falling off in the subscriptions in Fyzabad is to be regretted. Para. 248. 19. A proposal that a new Thanah should be built at Bahraich, and that the whole of the building now occupied by Thanah and Dispen- sary should be used as a dispensary, received the sanction of the Chief Commissioner some time ago. Para. 250. 20. In the comparative statement the cost of dieting each in-door patient at Bahraich during the year 1873 is said to have been Rs. 1-2-0, or 14 annas, and turning to that year's statements, the Officiating Chief Commissioner finds it was then entered as Rs. 1-3-9. Para. 299. 21. The Officiating Chief Commissioner quite agrees with you that idiots and incurable lunatics should not be kept in Charitable Dispen- saries. Para. 309. 22. It is noted that at Sultanpur the Gurjun oil treatment has afforded great relief in cases of leprosy. Paras. 354-360. 23. The Partabgarh Dispensary has long been popular. The attendance of out-door patients is larger than that of any dispensary in the province. The new building was opened in August last, and the accom- modation it affords being very good, there will doubtless be a consider- able increase in the number of in-door patients. Paras. 129-150-263. 21. The Officiating Chief Commissioner observes with regret that the figures for Branch Dispensaries are not always trustworthy. 25. In conclusion, I am to express the Officiating Chief Commis- sioner's appreciation of your services in visiting the various dispensaries, correcting irregularities, and superintending the department generally. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, H. J. SPARKS, Offg. Secretary to the Chief Commr., Oudh.

No. 570/C.C. FROM DR. H. M. CANNON, M. B. DEPUTY SURGEON GENERAL, INDIAN MEDICAL DEPARTMENT, LUCKNOW CIRCLE, To THE SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, OUDH. Dated Lucknow 17th April 1875. SIR, I HAVE the honor to submit a report on the working of the several Hospitals and Charitable Dispensaries in Oudh for the year 1874, which, agreeably to para. 2, Rule III, of the Resolution of the Government of India, Home Department, No. 68-2837, dated 21st November 1874, regarding the condensation of annual departmental reports, I have endeavoured to make as succinct as possible. 2. I shall therefore make reference to the special district reports for any subject of importance, and confine my remarks chiefly, in the following report, to personal observations made during my inspection of the Sadr Dispensaries, Jail, and Police Hospitals. 3. Extracts will be given from each medical officer's report on the Branch Dispensaries of his district. 4. During my tour I have visited 41 Sadr, Police, and Jail Hospitals, exclusive of the Branch Dispensaries; Kheri being the only district in Oudh that remains to be seen, which I will take an early opportunity of doing, or as soon as the current work of my office becomes less pressing. 5. I shall make it my particular care during the current year to visit and narrowly inspect as many of the 32 Branch Dispensaries as possible. 6. The Sadr Dispensaries being for the most part under the super- vision of well-selected, trustworthy European medical officers, with highly educated Assistant Surgeons attached, do not require the same amount of supervision as the smaller independent charges, where Branch Dispen- saries are presided over by Hospital Assistants subjected to all kinds of temptations, and guilty of every description of irregularity, when left too much to their own devices, such as concocting false bills and registers, and residing at a distance from their respective charges, contrary to the standing orders of the department. 7. I found it necessary at the commencement of last year to issue a circular order reminding Civil Surgeons that it was not only their duty,
( 2 ) but that of their subordinates, to supervise the conduct and progress of the native medical pupils attached to the several medical institutions under their charge. 8. The remarks made by me on the occasions of my recent visits of inspection will show how far this order has been attended to. I fear in some instances Civil Surgeons have taken but little interest in the progress and welfare of the pupils entrusted to them for instruction. 9. On the other hand, some few of the lads have made remarkable progress in their medical studies and English qualifications, especially where they have, at my recommendation, been induced to attend for two hours daily at the zil'a schools. 10. On the whole, I must say that, although much more might have been done, there has been considerable improvement in the conduct and progress of the medical pupils since 1873. 11. The Civil and Military Lock Hospital reports and statements have already been submitted through the prescribed channel by the several Cantonment Committees to the Oudh Government, as directed in para. 8 Quarter Master General's circular No. 89, dated 20th December 1869, it is therefore unnecessary to reproduce them here. Lunatic Asylum, Balrámpur Hospi- tal, King's Hospital, Unaneo or Greek Hospital. 12. At the close of the year 1873, there were 12 Sadr and 28 Branch Dispensaries in operation in the Pro- vince of Oudh, besides the several Jail and Police Hospitals, and the four institutions in Lucknow noted in margin. 13. There were four Branch Dispensaries opened during 1874, viz., Nawabganj, in the Gonda; Amethi, in the Sultanpur; and Dhaurahra and Singáhi, in the Kheri district. None have been closed, making in all 32 Branch Dispensaries. 14. The following is a summary view of the working of the Oudh Charitable Dispensaries for the year 1874. 15. On reference to Statement No. 2, it will be found that in the face of one of the healthiest seasons Oudh has enjoyed for several years, as many as 207, 4 patients received medical aid at the Provincial Dispen- saries during 1874, against 188,291 in 1873, giving an increase of 19, 5 in attendance of in and out-door patients, whereas the ascertained deaths, which in 1873 were as low as 1,075, have again fallen to 69 during the year under report, giving a decrease of 38 in the mortality amongst those who sought medical relief during 1874. 16. The capital operations, it will be noticed on reference to the same statement, have increased from 306 in 1873 to 391 in 1874, and on reference to the several dispensary inspection reports it will be seen how many were successful and by whom the operations were performed. 17. The minor operations have also increased from 8,461 to 10,391 during the year under review. Agreeably to suggestions contained in Secretary to the Chief Commissioner's letter No. 5046, dated 12th Sep-
( 3 ) tember 1874, I have had Form No. 16 so altered as to show the cash balances separately, which, I trust, will prevent any discrepancy in the accounts of receipts and expenditure for 1874. 18. With reference to para. 5 of the same letter, I warned all district medical officers to test carefully the registers of attendance at all the out-lying Branch Dispensaries, and, with the exception of those specially brought to notice in the body of this report, I have no reason to suspect they have been tampered with. 19. Considerable pressure was put on the Lucknow Medical Circle during 1874 to supply medical aid both to the famine districts in Bengal and the north of Oudh ; fortunately it was an exceedingly healthy year, which enabled me to detach one of the Hospital Assistants from every native regiment and several of the Police Battalions in this division, for the above duty. 20. As this report is written not only for the information of the Chief Commissioner, but also for submission to the Surgeon General Indian Medical Department, I beg to conclude my remarks by the following extracts from letter No. 4586, dated 5th October 1874, from the Commissioner of Fyzabad, to the Secretary to the Chief Commissioner, Oudh, by which it will be seen how these medical subordinates performed the arduous duties required of them :( 4 ) 4. " The officers thus employed were as below :Report on the Balrampur Medical School for the Year ending 31st December 1874. 1. As stated in last year's report, the school opened on the 14th April 1873. 2. The school was closed for two months'vacation during the hottest months, viz., May and June 1874. The new session will now annually commence from the 1st July of each year, and new students will be then admitted should any vacancies in the thirty scholarships occur during the previous year. In the long session, viz., from July to December, the greater subjects have been lectured upon, and during the short session, viz., from January to April, the lesser subjects will be lectured upon. 3. At the end of April 1874 the annual examination was held. The questions on all subjects were prepared by me and printed in Calcutta, so that the students could not have seen them till I placed them before them on the day of the examination. 4. On the 31st December 1873, there remained fifteen students. Syud Sujjad Hossein resigned after the annual examination in June 1874 finding that he was the last on the list, so that we commenced the new session with fourteen of the original number of students. 5. The following students obtained prizes at the annual examina- tion :( 2 ) 6. During the past long session, viz., from July to December 1874. the following lectures were delivered :( 3 ) Name of Students. Physiology and Hygiene 56 lectures and exami- nations.

The position of the students in their classes is shown herewith by the number of marks obtained at the monthly written examinations :( 4 ) 10.It is encouraging to find that among the candidates for admis- sion were two students, both Brahmans (the one had been dismissed for insubordination, and the other had resigned on account of caste prejudices) who regretted having left the school, and were very anxious to join it again. These two are now among the best students. Another encouraging circumstance is that a free student attended lectures regularly, but for whom there remained no vacant scholarship. 11.The new admissions belonged to the undermentioned castes :( 5 ) LUNATIC ASYLUM, LUCKNOW. 17. Carefully inspected every department of this institution, and each patient individually, in company with Dr. Whishaw, the Superinten- dent, on the 19th October 1874. 18. The patients, as a rule, presented a healthy, well-nourished appear- ance; there had been very little sickness, and the mortality slight during the year. The deaths having been reduced from 30 per cent in June 1873 to 13.5 up to date in the present year. Of the 149 inmates 16 were in hospital, three only of which could be considered bad cases, and three more sufficiently violent to require confinement in the cells. 19. The food and clothing was, as it has always been at this institu- tion, most excellent. 20. Although the rains were unusually heavy and prolonged during the year, there has been little or no flooding of the asylum grounds, so I feel bound to say the " bund" has, so far as it has been tried, answered the purpose intended, and I am convinced that if the Chief Commissioner will order the Executive Engineer, in consultation with Dr. Whishaw, to repair and improve the flood gates before next rainy season, there will be no necessity whatever to remove the asylum to another spot on account of floods from the Gumti. Annual Inspection for 1874. 21. Made my final annual inspection of this institution on the 12th January 1875. 22. There were 106 male and 34 female lunatics in the asylum on the occasion of this visit, and of these only 10 men and one woman, all slight cases, were under treatment in hospital. 23. The general appearance of the inmates, taking into consideration they are all lunatics suffering from every form of mental disease, is decidedly healthy. 24. I am sorry to observe, however, that the deaths which occurred in November (since my inspection on the 19th of October) have run up the percentage of deaths to strength from 13 to 20.0. Dr. Whishaw has been called on to explain this in the annual report for 1874. 25. The total number of deaths during the year out of a daily aver age of 101.52 men has been 13, and the total number of deaths during the year out of a daily average of 38 women is as high as 15 or of both 20.0 per cent to strength. 26. There were three men only under restraint as violent and dangerous in the cells, and 26 in the convict wards. I must say I never saw a more happy or contented looking set of lunatics ; they work both in the gardens and at the looms with pleasure to themselves, both of which employments have been very remunerative. On reference to the books I find they have made 215 blankets and 96 thans of cloth ; in fact, all their own clothing for the year 1874, the value of which is at, least Rs. 512.
( 6 ) 27. The diet, which is as follows, is of excellent quality :( 7 ) 31. There have been 25 capital operations, all of which but one were performed by Assistant Surgeon Ishan Chunder Roy; 22 were successful. 35. The hospital as a building has been fully described in former reports, and there is nothing to be desired in this respect. 36. The medicines and instruments procured on chargeable indent are sufficient and in good order. Those in use are well corked, the poisons are kept separate. 37. The conservancy arrangements, which I have had so often to complain of, are now in first rate order and properly carried out. 38. On reference to the following comparative statement it will be found that, the total attendance of out and in-door patients have increased from 9,344 in 1873 to 10,161 in 1875 :( 8 ) DISBURSEMENTS. 1873. 1874.

Inspected on the 14th January 1875 in company with Dr. Whishaw. 40. Third Grade Assistant Surgeon Nobin Chunder Mitter is in resident medical charge, and enjoys the confidence and esteem of every medical officer he has served under. 41. First Class Hospital Assistant Meer Nasur Ali has been attached to this and the City Lock Hospital ever since the occupation of Oudh ; he is a trustworthy, well-informed, well-conducted, public servant. 42. The medical pupils, three in number, viz., Beharee Lall, Syud Sujjad Hoosein, and Bakur Hoosein, have made fair progress in their studies, and have been tolerably regular in their attendance. 43. The establishment on the whole have conducted themselves well, and many of them given great satisfaction. 44. The books and records are neatly kept, and up to date; they show a daily average of 28.11 in-door and 131.54 out-door patients under treatment during the year 1874. 45. There have been 26 capital operations ; of these four were per- formed by Dr. Whishaw, and the remainder by Assistant Surgeon Nobin Chunder Mitter, all of which, with the exception of one, were successful. 46. The hospital as a building has been described in former reports. The instruments and medicines are in good order. The conservancy arrangements complete and properly carried out. This institution still maintains its character as one of the most popu- lar hospitals in the province. 47. On reference to the following statement it will be seen that 9,834 patients were treated during the year under review against 11,098 in 1873 ; this falling off is chiefly amongst the out-patients, and is entirely owing to the healthiness of the season and exemption from any epidemic visita- tions.

Inspected on the 1st February 1875. The out-door patients have been principally the public and private servants of the civil community who subscribe to the institution. Here are dispensed the prescriptions of the covenanted and uncovenanted officers of the civil station.
( 10 ) 49. Twenty-four patients remained at the close of 1873. During the year 3,115 persons applied for treatment, making a total 3,139 out- patients ; of these 11 died. 50. One hundred and two minor, but no capital operations were performed. 51. The daily average number of out-patients was 27. 52. Rs. 898 were subscribed by the European and Native community. Add to this Rs. 1,799-5-0, the balance remaining at the end of 1873, and the Government allowance of Rs. 1,056, making a sum total Rs. 3,753-5-0. Of this were paid for establishment Rs. 1,056, for bazaar medicines Rs. 509-1-5, for contingencies Rs. 173-10-0, total 1,738-11-5. There still remains to be paid the bill not yet received from Allahabad for Europe medicines. The balance in the Treasury at the end of 1874 was Rs. 2,014-9-7. 53. Establishment. 1st Class Hospital Assistant Shaikh Deedar Buksh continues to merit the good opinion which has always been enter- tained regarding him. 54. Medical pupils Ahmed Hoosein and Chada Lall. Both these boys have behaved well, and made a reasonable advance in the elements of medical knowledge. 55. The instruments and medicines are carefully kept and in good order. The books and records are all made up to date. POLICE HOSPITALS, LUCKNOW. 56. Made my annual inspection of the City and District Police Hospital on the 17th January 1875. 57. There were 14 district and 11 city police under treatment in hospital on the occasion of my visit. 58. The strength of the district police for 1874 averaged 849. I find from the books that the daily average number of sick to strength for the past year was only 2.23, and deaths to strength 0.23, the total number of deaths in hospital being only two. 59. The average strength of the city police for the same period was 829, the sick to strength only one per cent, and the deaths to strength 0.60, the total number of deaths in hospital were only five. 60. First Class Assistant Surgeon Chundee Churn Ghose in medical charge has been attentive to his duty, and conducted himself to my satis- faction. Second Class Hospital Assistant Shaik Ramzan is well reported of both as to conduct and qualifications. 61. The instruments, books, and medicines are all in good order, and the dry earth conservancy arrangements complete. 1 regret, however, to find that the suggestions made by me so far back as the 25th of April 1874 for the improvement of the post-mortem room or dead-house have not been attended to; in fact, the bodies are still liable to be infested with flies and mutilated by rats and mungooses.
( 11 ) CENTRAL JAIL HOSPI- TAL, LUCKNOW. 62. Inspected on the 20th February 1875. On reference to the books, found the daily average number of prisoners was 17.66, daily per- centage of sick to strength 1.51 ; the total number of deaths was 27, or only 1.52 to strength; the hospital was clean, the books, instruments, and medicines in good order, and the conservancy arrangements appeared to be perfect. 63. There were no complaints against any of the medical establish- ment. DISTRICT JAIL HOSPI- TAL, LUCKNOW. 64. Inspected on the 20th February 1875 the jail hospital instru- ments and records, found everything correct and in order. 65. The books show the daily average strength of prisoners to have been 1,109.64 for 1874. There were in all 10 deaths, or 1.78 per cent. to total strength. 66. First Class Hospital Assistant Sudoollah Khan with English qualifications is well reported of. SADR DISPENSARY, BARA BANKI. 67. Inspected the dispensary on the 31st January 1875 in company with Dr. Franklin. 68. First Class Hospital Assistant Sheikh Hinghun is in resident medical charge ; has been attached to this dispensary since September 1873; he is well reported of as steady and attentive to his duties. 69. The books show a daily average attendance of 25.86 in-door and 105.64 out-door patients. 70. There have been 51 capital operations, exclusive of fractures, during 1874, three only of which terminated fatally, 13 were relieved and 35 cured. Of the 419 minor operations 9 were relieved and 359 cured. Six of the capital operations were performed by the Hospital Assistant, the remainder by Dr. Franklin himself. 71. Medical pupil Puttu Lall soon after his arrival became irregular and inattentive, and on being refused leave absconded on the 8th August last, and has not been heard of since. 72. The instruments, with the exception of the eye case are in good order; the medicines are carefully corked and kept, the books are up to date, and the accommodation for hospital establishment excellent. 73. The increase in attendance in an exceptionally healthy year is a sure indication of the growing popularity of the Bara Banki dis- pensaries. 74. The results are most creditable to Dr. Franklin. 75. The Commissioner has invited the attention of the Deputy Commissioner to the financial position of the Sadr dispensary, which requires looking into.
( 12 ) SADR DISPENSARY, BARA BANKI. 76. The following comparative statement is submitted :( 13 ) JAIL HOSPITAL, BARA BANKI. 77. Inspected on 31st January 1875 the jail hospital, medicines, instruments, and records, and found everything in excellent order. 78. The books show that out of a daily average of 575.05 prisoners there were only 11 deaths, or 2.32 per cent to strength during 1874. POLICE HOSPITAL, BARA BANKI. 79. Inspected on the above date. Found everything in good order ; there are no latrines attached to the lines for the use of the police force, which is a great defect. 80. The daily average strength of the force for 1874 was 495.66 ; two sepoys died at their houses, making the percentage of deaths to strength only 0.40. BRANCH DISPENSA- RIES, BARA BANKI. 81. The following short reports and comparative statements as drawn out by Dr. Franklin show the working of the six branch dispensaries in the Bara Banki district for 1874 :( 14 ) 87. The daily average attendance was 30.78 compared with 25.81 in 1873. 88. One capital and 124 minor operations were performed during the year. 89. The expenditure as compared with 1873 was,( 15 ) 97. The expenditure was as follows :( 16 ) Of these 1,303 were cured or relieved, 315 ceased to attend, 1 died, and 21 remain. 105. Seven capital and 137 minor operations were performed by the hospital assistant. This is the largest number performed at any branch dispensary in the district. 106. The expenditure was as follows :( 17 ) 114. There were 11 capital operations during the year, of which 10 were successful ; 9 were performed by Dr. Selous and 1 by the hospital assistant. 115. First Class Hospital Assistant Shaik Mahommed Bux is well spoken of, but I consider too much of his time is taken up in keeping the records both of the sadr and branch, dispensaries. 116. The two medical pupils Ramut-oolla Khan and Shafaut-oolla Khan, have not made such progress in their studies up to the occasion of my inspection as I had reason to expect, after the remarks I made on this subject when I visited Unao in March last. I trust more attention may be given to the training and education of these lads for the future ; their knowledge of the names of the simplest drugs is very limited, and neither of them read nor write English sufficiently to keep the registers. I hope arrangements will be made at once to send them for two or three hours daily to the zil'a school, and subject them to occasional examinations in every branch of their studies. 117. The hospital as a building is suitable. The Police Hospital is in the same block, but both these institutions suffer from a great defect, which has before been represented, the want of accommodation for a resident hospital assistant in the one case, and for the establishment in the other. I beg this may again be brought to the notice of the local authorities 118. The instruments and medicines are carefully kept, and the latter neatly arranged and labelled ; the eye-case is old-fashioned, and the in- struments practically useless.

It has accommodation for 6 in-door patients and quarters for the native doctor in charge. 128. The diseases treated present some remarkable peculiarities. Diseases of the abdomen caused more admissions than even fevers, 880 against 609, and of these 880, 405 were cases of dyspepsia,( 20 ) Disbursement. DISBURSEMENTS. 1873. 1874. Rs. A. P. Rs. A. P.

PURWA BRANCH DISPENSARY. 1 30. With regard to the branch dispensary at Purwa, I am happy to report a satisfactory progress in the popularity of the institution. The number of admissions of out-door patients has risen from 3,729 to 3,934, the average daily attendance from 29.39 to 40.16. There were no in-door patients in 1873, so that no comparison can be made. 131. The diseases treated do not present anything remarkable or leading to the suspicions of bad diagnoses or cocked returns, except, per- haps, the large number of simple continued fevers which were probably ague. Of cases neuralgia seems high. BRANCH DISPENSARY, PURWA. 1873. 1874.

Inspected on 5th March 1875 in company with the Civil Sur- geon, Dr. Ellis, 133. There were on this occasion 14 in-door patients under treat- ment, several of which were important surgical cases. 134. It appears from the books that the daily average number of in-door patients for 1874 was 11.66. The dispensary is capable of accom- modating double that number. 135. The attendance of out-patients only averaged 33.61 per diem, perhaps the smallest amount of medical relief given at any sadr dispensary in the province. 136. There were eight capital operations during 1874, all of which were successful, and all but three were performed by Dr. Ellis himself. 137. Assistant Surgeon Tarni Churn Dutt has been in resident medical charge since 1870, and although a well educated and attentive man, he is not popular with the natives of the country, and the dispensary suffers accordingly. He states himself he is not appreciated by the people, and requests to be transferred to Bengal. 138. Medical pupil Futty Ally is well conducted, but has made but poor progress in his studies; it is evident little pains has been taken to educate him.

The in-door patients have diminished, but there is not much accommodation for this class of patients nor funds for their support. 143. There are no subscriptions in Mahmudabad specially for this dispensary. The money is given from that subscribed for dispensaries in the district generally. 144. First Class Hospital Assistant Zahoor Hussein has been in charge of the dispensary during the year. He is well qualified for his work, takes an interest in it, and appears to be popular. On my inspection I found the hospital records correctly kept up to date, a number of patients in attendance, and everything in good order. Zahoor Hussein passed the examination for promotion to First Grade Hospital Assistant in October 1873, shortly after he took charge of the dispensary. BRANCH DISPENSARY, MAHMUDABAD. 1873. 1874.

( 24 ) KHERI SADR DISPENSARY 145. A description of this dispensary has been given in former reports. It is well supplied with all the necessary fittings, such as almiras, tables, and charpoys, and each bed has a mattress, durrie, and blanket. 146. The year 1874 having been an exceptionally healthy one, it is only natural there should be a decrease in the number of people applying for relief. There were 3,674 out-door and 235 in-door treated at the sadr, over 800 of which were suffering from intermittent fever; the confidence the people have in attending this well-managed dispensary is undoubted. There were 13 capital operations during the year, all of which were per- formed by Dr. Higginson, and all were successful. 147. Second Class Hospital Assistant Rajjib Khan has been in charge of the Sadr Dispensary throughout the year ; his conduct and qualifications are very satisfactory. He writes and speaks English fairly.

The following are Dr. Higginson's remarks on the four Branch Dispensaries in the Kheri district:( 26 ) BRANCH DISPENSARY SINGAHI. 153. This dispensary was opened on the 23rd July last, and is in charge of 3rd Class Hospital Assistant Mahomed Yar Khan. I inspected it on the 14th December, and was displeased with its untidy dirty appearance; it was more like an institution gone out of use than one newly established. This is a very sickly part of the district, and kindness and attention on the part of the hospital assistant should, I think, soon make this dispensary much frequented. 647 out-door and 33 in-door patients have been treated since the opening day : goitre is very prevalent; 77 persons applied for treatment, and 52 are recorded as relieved or cured. The build- ing is, of course, in good repair, being quite new; it contains two wards and a room for medicines, with a large verandah on three sides; there are a latrine and a cookhouse in the compound. BRANCH DISPENSARY DHAURAHRA. 154. This dispensary was opened on the 20th August last in a house lent temporarily for the purpose by the Mahárájah of Kappurthala. 3rd Class Hospital Assistant Allabanda is in charge ; he is a man of inferior attainments, quite ignorant of English, and unable himself to prepare the monthly returns correctly. I visited Dhaurahra on the 4th December to inspect the temporary dispensary, and to choose a site for the permanent one, which is now in course of erection. 476 out-door patients have been treated up to the end of the year ; there is no accommodation as yet for in-door patients: with a skilful experienced hospital assistant in charge this dispensary should be largely attended, as it is in the centre of an unhealthy part of the district: goitre is prevalent hereabouts. The Mahárájah of Kappurthala has promised to contribute Rs. 380 a year towards the support of this dispensary. Funds. 155. The expenditure of the Sadr, Gola, and Muhamdi dispensaries was met from the subscriptions Native and European: there was a balance of Rs. 204-0-4 to credit on the 1st January 1874 : subscriptions were small in 1873, and in November of that year a sum of Rs. 500 was transferred from other sources : in 1874 the subscriptions amounted to Rs. 1,262-2-4; on the 1st January 1875 there was a balance of Rs. 379-2 9 to the credit of these three dispensaries. The expenditure of the new dispensaries at Singáhi and Dhaurahra has been debited to local rates : these institutions having been established in 1874, come under the new rules, i. e., the Government allowance only covers half the pay of the hospital assistant in charge, the remainder and the salary of the com- pounder are paid from district funds. Each hospital assistant sends with the contingent bill of the month receipts in support of every charge, and these are examined at the sadr before the bill is passed. As will be seen from the comparative statements appended, the general expenditure decreased considerably in 1874, but without any detriment to the institutions. I am not aware of any charge having been made for Europe medicines, or it is a nominal one, for it has not been debited. 156.

JAIL HOSPITAL, HARDOI. 164. Inspected on the 19th December. Strength of prisoners 256, only four mild cases under treatment. The prisoners have been remarkably healthy during 1874 ; the daily average of sick to strength has been 2.4, and the total number of deaths two. 165. The dry earth system of conservancy is fully carried out; the medicines and instruments in good order. 166. Third Class Hospital Assistant Abdool Wahid is unfavorably reported of by Dr. Logg; he absented himself on one occasion for 24 hours, for which I ordered himself to personally report himself at 12 and 4 o'clock daily at the Civil Surgeon's quarters until further orders. This is not the first time he has been handed up by his superior officer ; his next offence will be visited with a severer punishment. POLICE HOSPITAL HARDOI. 167. Inspected on the 20th December 1874. The strength of the police force is 444 ; there were only two old patients under treatment on the occasion of my visit; the men have been exceedingly healthy during the current year, only 6.44 of sick to strength up to date. The hospital as a building is one of the best I have seen in the province, but the drainage in the neighbourhood and throughout the lines is very defective.

( 37 ) SADR DISPENSARY, FYZABAD. 181.The building is well known to be one of the finest dispensaries in Oudh, I was sorry however to observe that owing to the roof being under timbered, the wood work is beginning to lurch, and is in some places dangerous, causing considerable leakage, and I fear will require numerous supports which will spoil the appearance of the spacious wards. 182.Third Grade Assistant Surgeon, Greesh Chunder Mitter, in medical charge, is most favorably spoken of by the Superintendent Dr. J. Cameron. 183.I examined the instruments and records and found everything in excellent order. January 1875. 184.Made my final annual inspection of this institution on the 25th January. There are 21 patients under treatment of which seven are important surgical cases. The records shew a daily average of 18.03 in-door and 31.05 out-door patients for the year 1874. 185.There have been 33 capital operations for which 19 were per- formed by Dr. J. Cameron and 14 by the Assistant Surgeon in resident medical charge, of these 24 were successful; the number of deaths in hospital have been 66; this may appear high, but it must be remembered many of them were from the first hopeless cases and merely came in to die. 186.The medical pupil, Mahommed Hossein, has made fair progress lately, but has left off attending the English class at the zilla school, which I. have ordered him at once to continue to do. 187.Comparative statement is herewith submitted.

( 39 ) 25th January 1875. 191.Made my annual inspection of this hospital on the 25th January; there were seven patients under treatment on the occasion of this visit out of a strength of 573.3 men; the daily average sick for 1874 was 13.83. 192.The total number of deaths all in hospital was four or .69 per cent. to strength. 193.The lines are in tolerable good repair but are badly situated, and the surface drainage is indifferent, but as the new lines are nearly complete, no further remarks need be made on this subject. 194.Examined the books, instruments, and medicines, all appear in good order. 195.The following annual reports of the three branch dispensaries in the Fyzabad district, are submitted by Dr. J. Cameron. AKBARPUR BRANCH DISPENSARY. 196.The dispensary is still in the small building in the Tehsil com- pound occupied by it at its commencement in 1872. 197.A good site for the new building has been approved by the Deputy Commissioner, and funds have been provided for the work by the Local Committee in their coming year's budget. 198.The establishment during the past year consisted, as hitherto, of the Hospital Assistant and a Compounder ; menial servants being employed only when required by the presence of in-door patients. STATEMENT I. Receipts and expenditure. 199.At the close of 1873, there was a balance in hand of Rs. 286-7-0. The receipts during the year were Rs. 592-8-0, of which Rs. 20 were derived from private subscriptions and Rs. 572 from local rates. 200.The expenditure was Rs. 580-13-5 leaving of Rs. 298-4-7, an amount sufficient to meet the expenditure of the remaining three months of the financial year. STATEMENT II. Patients treated (1) In- door. 201.The total number treated was 45 against 79 in the previous year. As in the case of the Tanda dispensary the Hospital Assistant here was desired to avoid as far as possible admitting incurables, and to keep the little accommodation the building affords, for the treatment of urgent surgical and medical cases, the preference to be given to surgical. This accounts for the falling off in the number of in-door patients. 202.Of the 45 treated in-door, 37 were discharged cured, seven relieved, and one died. The fatal case was one of severe and extensive injuries. (2) Out-door attendance.. 203.The number of new cases was, according to the return, 4,996 against 9,199 in the previous year. This is an enormous decrease, too great I fear, to be fully accounted for by the un- doubtedly greater healthiness of the year. I have frequently inspected this dispensary during the year and have on each occasion scrutinized the daily register of out-door attendance, and warned the Hospital Assistant to avoid making false entries to keep up appearance. The result has been that the past year's figures, although considerably exaggerated, are nearer
( 40 ) the truth. The single fact that 304 cases of Gonorrh( 41 ) 1873. 1874.

BRANCH DISPENSARY, SHAHGANJ. 208.This dispensary still occupies the temporary quarters given rent free by the manager of the estates of the late Mahárájah Sir Mán Singh, at the commencement in February 1872. 209.Its situation in the main street of the village is more open to the gaze of passers-by than is desirable, but the accommodation is the best that can be had at present. Of the three branch dispensaries this is to be the last to be furnished with a permanent building, so that the prospect of better accommodation for it is rather distant. Statement No. 1,( 42 ) tion of Rs. 13 from the revenues of the late Mahárájah Sir Mán Singh's estate, that he cannot afford to pay it, and that the institution of the local rates tax relieved him of the duty to give direct aid to the dispensary ; one of the objects of the tax being the support of branch dispensaries. The Tahsíldár of Bíkapur, again, whose duty it has been to collect the rest of the promised subscriptions, says he finds so much difficulty in getting in the ordinary demands of Government, that it is useless at present to attempt the collection of "voluntary" subscriptions. 211.The expenditure for the year was Rs. 1,125-8-0, leaving a balance sufficient to meet the charges of the remaining three months of the finan- cial year, so that the failure of income from private sources will not be felt. Statement. No. 2.( 43 ) probably not more than six of them can probably be so designated. The fact remains, however, that a good deal of surgery has been done by him. 221.He has operated three times successfully for stone in the bladder during the year. I chanced to be present on one of these occasions, and was agreeably surprised to see the intelligent care and coolness he dis- played while operating. All these " stone cases" made good recoveries. 222.The daily average cost of dieting each in-door patient was less than seven pies, a very low figure, indicating good and careful manage- ment. Those patients who are able to provide their own food while in hospital are obliged to do so. 223.Although my inspection visits have always been made at uncer- tain times and without previous intimation being given, I have invariably found this dispensary in excellent order in every respect. 24. First Class Hospital Assistant Gumandee Lall has been in charge since the commencement in 1872. He has done his work to my entire satisfaction. He is an intelligent physician and a good surgeon, and is much esteemed by all classes of the people. In short, I cannot speak too highly of him, both as a private individual and a professional man.

A site on the east of the town (the best of the three pro- posed by the municipal committee) has been fixed upon; materials are being collected and building operations are on the eve of commencement. It is expected that the dispensary will be in its new quarters before the end of the ensuing hot season. 227. The establishment consists of a hospital assistant, a compounder, and the usual staff of menial servants. The hospital is furnished with cooking vessels and with other necessaries for the treatment of in-door patients. Statement No. 1-Receipt and Expenditure. 228.At the close of 1873 there was a balance in hand of Rs. 217-5-5. The receipts for the year were Rs. 943-9-11, of which Rs. 142-12-0 was from private subscriptions and Rs. 800-13-11 from local rates. 229. The expenditure under all heads was Rs. 923-15-2, leaving a balance of Rs. 237-0-2 at the credit of the dispensary (a sufficient amount) to meet the expenditure of the remaining three months of the financial year. 230. The cost of establishment was considerably less than in the previous year, the hospital assistant (being of a lower grade) receiving less pay than his predecessor. 231. The cost of dieting appears high considering the small number of in-door patients treated, but this may be partly owing to the severe character of some of the cases requiring prolonged treatment.
( 45 ) 232.The cost of dieting each in-door patient per diem was about 12 pies (one anna) or nearly double that of the Shahganj branch dispensary. 233.The increase of expenditure under the head of contingencies was mainly due to the cost of additional cooking vessels.

On the occasion of my visit there were only two slight cases under treatment in hospital in a strength of 504 ; the books show a daily average of 11.49 sick on an average strength of 605.24. 276. The total number of deaths have been only 12, or two per cent. to strength. 277. The prisoners have been exceedingly healthy ; no epidemic disease whatever.
( 55 ) 278. Third Class Hospital Assistant Muzhurool Soobhan has been attached to this jail since 13th September 1873; is tolerably well quali- fied in English, and is well reported of by Dr. Heffernan as steady and attentive. 279. The hospital is a large airy barrack, and the surface-drainage in the hospital compound appears well attended to. The dry earth system of conservancy is strictly carried out in the latrines; in fact, everything is clean and in good order. 280. The instruments, medicines, and books, are carefully kept, and in good order. POLICE HOSPITAL GONDA. 281. Inspected on 27th January 1875. There were seven cases under treatment, two syphilis. 282. The daily average sick during the past year has been 6.42 to a daily average strength of 483. There has been only one death in hospital. 283. The hospital and lines are in good repair, but there are no latrines attached to the police barracks. The surface-drainage is excellent. 284. Second Class Hospital Assistant Oodet Narain Singh has been attached to this hospital since the 12th December 1867 ; he is qualified in English ; is favorably reported on as to conduct and qualifications. 285. The following report on the working of the branch dispensaries in the Gonda district were submitted by Dr. Heffernan :( 56 ) funds will be available for this work and also for hospital assistant and servants at Utraula, and that the building will be commenced at once. BRANCH DISPENSARY NAWABGANJ. 292. This dispensary was opened on the 16th November under the charge of First Class Hospital Assistant Futteh Khan, a very intelligent and energetic man. During that short time 1,009 patients attended the hospital. I visited the dispensary twice and found everything correct. 293. This dispensary was much needed, and will become a most popular one.

( 59 ) SADR DISPENSARY, RAE BARELI. 294. Inspected civil dispensary on 9th January 1875 in company with Dr. C. Cameron. 295. Found 25 in-door patients under treatment; the daily average throughout the year has been as high as 29.72 and out-door patients 45.74. 296. There have been 19 capital operations, all of which were suc- cessful; half of these were performed by the Superintendent, Dr. Cameron, and half by the Assistant Surgeon Raj Coomar Coondoo. 297. Medical Pupil Ashurf Ali has made considerable progress in his studies, and his conduct is well reported of by Dr. Cameron. 298. This dispensary as far as the building goes is commodious and suitable for the purpose, but the roof is decidedly unsafe and requires immediate repair; in fact, the male patients have had to be removed to the poorhouse. 299. There is one defect in the arrangements which urgently requires alteration, namely, that the idiots and incurable lunatics should not be located in the dispensary wards, as it causes overcrowding and incon- venience, and renders the institution unpopular. I beg to suggest that a separate ward be built for their special accommodation in connection with the poorhouse. 300. The lepers also, who are on the increase, should, for the same reasons, have a separate ward or huts built for them in connection to the above-named institution. 301. The instruments and medicines are in good order. 302. The books up to date are neatly kept. There is ample accom- modation for the assistant surgeon, medical pupil, and all the hospital establishment on the premises. Dr. Cameron reports favorably of the conduct and qualifications of Assistant Surgeon Raj Coomar Coondoo, who is most skilful and attentive in the treatment of the sick, and from what I have seen myself I can unreservedly endorse this opinion. 303. I trust the local authorities will take early means to remedy the defects I have pointed out in this institution, as I believe they have ample funds at their disposal to enable them to do so. 304. The comparative statement is submitted. SADR DISPENSARY, RAE BARELI. 1873. 1874.

Inspected the hospital at 9 A. M., on 9th January 1875 ; found 13 cases under treatment, principally men suffering from rhuematism and ulcers. The percentage of sick to strength is only 2.68; in fact, they have been remarkably healthy, there has not been a single death in the force during the past year, which is remarkable, considering how the men are worked and exposed. The hospital is well built and ventilated and in good repair, the lines are high and dry, and kept exceedingly clean.
( 61 ) found everything in excellent order. Second Class Hospital Assistant, Shaik Abdoollah is an experienced, well conducted man, and very attentive to his duties, but has not qualified in English, which he is quite capable of doing as he keeps all the books and registers and reads English prescriptions. JAIL HOSPITAL, RAE BARELI.. 306. Inspected on 9th January 1875, in company with Dr. C. Cameron ; there were 30 under treatment in hospital out of a strength of 749 prisoners. The new jail is in progress of being built, and the sick are treated in three separate buildings, which ensures ample space and ventilation. Of the 19 deaths which occurred during the past year (17 males and two females) six or seven of the patients were brought in in an advanced state of illness. The percentage of sick to strength for 1874 has been 2.79, and deaths to strength only 1.97. The prisoners and sick in this jail are well clothed, fed, and cared for, and the conservancy arrangements are perfect. 307. First Class Hospital Assistant Kalee Churn, who was sent to this post in June to officiate for Third Class Hospital Assistant Miran Bux, since dead, is a first-rate medical subordinate, and has gained the entire confidence of Dr. C. Cameron. SADR DISPENSARY SULTANPUR. 308. Inspected the sadr dispensary in company with the Civil Surgeon on the 22nd January 1875. 309. There were 11. patients under treatment; it appears from the books that the daily average for the year was 12.39 and of out-door patients 55.07, there are also in addition to the above 12 leper cases from the poorhouse receiving treatment, and Dr. Cameron reports great relief has been given to all of these by the diligent application of gurjun oil, in fact, all of them expressed in my presence the decided benefit they had experienced from this mode of treatment. 310. First Class Hospital Assistant Bhyroo Pershad is attentive and trustworthy, and is favorably reported of by Dr. Cameron ; he is well qualified in English. 311. The books, medicines, and instruments are all in good order. 312. The dispensary as a building is quite suitable for the purpose. 313. There have been 23 capital operations ; all the important cases were performed by Dr. Cameron himself, namely 17 by Dr. A. Cameron and six by the hospital assistant; of these 17 were successful, five were unsuccessful, and of one the result was unknown. 314. The comparative statement is submitted.

( 63 ) JAIL HOSPITAL, SULTANPUR. 315. Inspected the jail hospital on the 22nd January 1875 in company with Dr. A. Cameron. 316. On the occasion of my visit there were only two slight cases under treatment in hospital. 317. The persons have been exceedingly healthy during the year; out of a daily average strength of 397.29, the sick to strength has been only 3.98, and the total number of deaths five, or 1.24 per cent. There has been no epidemic whatever ; the surface drainage is excellent, and the dry earth conservancy system is fully carried out in the latrines. 318. Third Class Hospital Assistant Yasseen Khan has been attached to this jail since the 3rd March 1874 ; he is regular in his attendance and attentive to his duties; his medical qualifications are fair, but he has not passed in English. 319. The instruments and medicines are in good order, and the books are neatly kept and up to date ; everything I saw reflects the greatest credit on the management. POLICE HOSPITAL, SULTANPUR. 320. 22nd January 1875, there were nine cases under treatment in hospital, the strength of this police force is 808. 321. The lines, hospital, and grounds about are exceedingly clean, and the surface drainage excellent; the health of the force has been good, only one death from small-pox. 322. Third Class Hospital Assistant Busheroodeen has been attached to the police hospital since 2nd January 1875, he is well reported of, and has done his duty to the satisfaction of Dr. Cameron. 323. Found everything in good order ; a latrine, however, is much required for the sepoys in the lines; there is another great defect, there is no proper accommodation for the resident hospital assistant and his family, and the hospital establishment is entirely unprovided with accommodation on the premises. SULTANPUR BRANCH DISPENSARIES. BRANCH DISPENSARY MUSAFIRKHANA. 324. This dispensary is situated in the serai; it is supported entirely by the local cess fund ; a grant-in-aid has been applied for this and the other two branches similar to that received by the sadr dispensary. Expenses. 325. The total expenditure for the year, exclusive of the price of European medicines, which was probably within Rs. 150, was Rs. 484-7-3. The smallness of the amount was partly owing to the hospital assistant being of the third grade and receiving only Rs. 20 per mensem salary. Hospital Assistant. 326. The dispensary was under the charge of Third Class Hospital Assistant Khoob Lal, who was suspended for three months from employ ment at the end of the year for giving a false certificate to a police constable, He is a man of inferior professional qualifications and unacquainted with English, and though I am of opinion that the total number of cases returned as treated during the year is probably correct, I have no confidence in his returns as regards the naming of the diseases.
( 64 ) 327. Out-door patients only were treated at the dispensary, there being no accommodation for in-door patients in the present temporary quarters. A suitable building has been sanctioned, and will probably be erected this year. 328. The total number of patients treated, according to the returns, was 3,685, of these 1,479 were Musalmans and 2,206 Hindús. The num- ber of adult males was 2,672, of females 653, and of children under 10 years of age 353. The daily average attendance was 27.79. 329. The results were in 2,516 cure or relief; in 1,133 unknown, and 36 remained at the end of the year. None were known to have died. 330. For the reason above stated, there would be little use in making detailed comments on the returns of diseases treated during the year. They were similar to those treated at the sadr dispensary. The number of admissions for fevers is put down at 658, rheumatic affections 122, syphilitic 69, cases of leprosy 29, conjunctivitis 129, affections of the ear 54, bronchial affections 166, dyspepsia 220, dysentery 199, diarrh( 65 ) affections 156, dyspepsia 114, dysentery 61, enlarged spleen 76, gonorrh( 66 ) English. On the two occasions during the six months that I visited the dispensary, I was satisfied with the condition of the medicines and instruments and with the attendance. NOTE.( 67 ) 1873. 1874.

POLICE HOSPITAL PRATABGARH, 361. Inspected on 23rd January with Dr. Hart. 362. Out of a police force of 401 men there were seven slight cases in hospital. 363. The books show a daily average of 13.23 of sick to strength during the year, which gives a percentage of sick to strength of 3.33. 364. There have only been two deaths, one in and one out of hos- pital, or a total percentage of deaths to strength. 48. 365. The police force has been on the whole exceedingly healthy; they have suffered from no epidemic. The hospital as a building is faultless, and is on the standard plan, and arrangements have been made to provide the hospital and whole of the hospital establishment with good quarters. 366. The lines are clean and the barrack accommodation sufficient the surface drainage is good ; there is, however, one great defect which
( 68 ) should at once be remedied, there is no latrine for the police in or near the lines, so that the very people who have to bring up others for committing nuisances are obliged themselves to set a bad example for want of this very necessary accommodation. 367. Second Class Hospital Assistant Dewa Singh has been attached to this hospital since the 5th November 1869; he is a well conducted man and very attentive to his duties and well qualified in English. JAIL HOSPITAL, PAR- TABGARH. 368. Inspected the jail hospital on the 23rd with Dr. Hart. 369. It is a miserable place, but as a new jail is in progress of con- struction I need make no further remarks on this subject ; but of a total strength of 550 prisoners in the old jail and the working gang on the new jail, there were 17 slight cases in hospital. 370. From the records it appears that out of the daily average of 661.48 strength in both jails, the total deaths were 14 in number, or only 2.11 per cent of deaths to strength. BRANCH DISPENSARY, KUNDA. 371. The following is Dr. Hart's report on the branch dispensaries of his district. 372. The tahsil and thanah having been given up and all the Government servants removed to Kunda, 6 miles southwest of Bihar, it was deemed advisable to remove this institution as soon as a temporary building, which was then in hand, had been finished ; this was effected on the 1st September 1874. 373. The temporary branch dispensary is situated close to Kunda bazaar, the tahsil, and thanah ; it is a kutcha-pucka building with a tiled roof, the permanent building and out-offices have been sanctioned and will be completed in 1875 ; the present building consists of two rooms, one occupied by the hospital assistant, and the other as dispensary room, there are no out offices. 374. The water is obtained from a well adjoining the tahsíl, it is good and sufficient. Food is not given, as the patients are not kept in. 375. 2,166 patients were treated, or 500 more than that of 1873. 376. 47 minor operations were performed during 1874, while in the previous year 13 was the number. 377. The receipts from local cess fund amounted to Rs. 624-6-6, and the disbursements for establishment, hospital assistant, medicines, and contingencies, amount to Rs. 648-14-2. 378. I visited this branch dispensary three times during the year, it has been in charge of Third Class Hospital Assistant Jehangeer Khan; his conduct is good and his qualications fair; he has passed the English test examination, and receives increased pay.

( 70 ) BRANCH DISPENSARY PATTI. 379. The new buildings have not been commenced, and the old hut, after undergoing repairs, has been in use throughout the year ; there are no outhouses. 380. From a pucka well near the hut the water is good and sufficient. 381. As only out patients are treated, no food is given. 382. 1,556 out-patients were treated, or an increase of 332 over that of the year previous. 383. Fever gave rise to the most admissions. 384. 133 minor operations were performed, an increase of 24 over that of 1873. 385. The receipts from local cess fund amounted to Rs. 648-14-2, and the disbursements for establishment, hospital assistant, medicines, and contingencies, amounts to Rs. 648-14-2. 386. I visited this branch dispensary three times during the year and found it well attended; medicines in good order and properly kept; in- struments in good order. Third Class Hospital Assistant Ramzan Ally is a good man, attentive to his duties, and possesses a very good knowledge of his profession, he is progressing in the English language for his examina- tion.

FROM THE OFFG. SECY, TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, OUDH, TO THE DEPUTY SURGEON GENERAL, INDIAN MEDICAL DEPARTMENT, LUCKNOW CIRCLE. Dated Lucknow, the 15th September 1876. SIR, GENERAL DEPARTMENT. I AM directed to acknowledge the receipt of your Annual Report on Charitable Hospitals and Dispensaries, in Oudh, for the year 1875. 2. The report is in the same form as the last one. The Officiating Chief Commissioner, being aware that you impressed on all your subordin- ates the necessity of accuracy in their reports, is disappointed to find a great number of mistakes and discrepancies in your report and the state- ments that accompany it. I am to give the following as instances :( 2 ) Several discrepancies between the balances on 1st January 1875, according to your reports of 1874 and 1875, are unexplained. For example, Balance according to report of 1874. of 1875. Sitapur ... Rs. 768 2 2 ... Rs. 487 5 9 Akbarpur ... ( 3 ) ment No. III. is to be trusted, there has been a great falling off in in-door patients, the figures being 15,761 in 1874, and 6,121 in 1875. The Officiating Chief Commissioner, however, puts little trust in this statement; he finds, moreover, from the statements in the body of the report, that the number of in-door patients admitted during 1875 exceed- ed 7,000, while those admitted during the preceding year were less than that number. Paras. 10 and 11. 5. It is satisfactory to find a considerable increase in the number of operations, both capital and minor, that have been performed. The Officiating Chief Commissioner notes that you entertain doubts regarding the accuracy of the returns submitted from some of the Branch Dispen- saries ; he is not sure that he rightly understands your remark that "although the trustworthiness of some of the returns from Branch "Dispensaries under this heading may be received with suspicion, "especially in the Hardoi and Unao districts, where severe fractures "and dislocations have been included," &c., for he finds that these cases have been included in the number of operations reported elsewhere; for instance, at Lucknow (para. 4) and Kheri (para. 125). Whether such cases should be classed as capital or minor must, he presumes, be left to the Surgeon to determine ; but if you mean that these cases are at some dispensaries included in the total number of operations recorded, and at others excluded, he thinks that some general rule should be laid down for the Province. Para. 14. 6. Your remarks regarding the addition of a dead-house and contagious disease ward to Sadr dispensaries, where such buildings do not exist, will be communicated to local committees. Paras. 21-23. 7. The Officiating Chief Commissioner agrees generally with you that it would be well were every Sadr Dispensary under the charge of an Assistant Surgeon. He also concurs with you in thinking that, as a rule, the treatment at Branch Dispensaries should be limited to out-door patients, the more serious cases being sent to the Sadr. This matter will be brought to the notice of the local committees. Para. 27. 8. The Officiating Chief Commissioner regrets that you were unable to visit more than three-fourths of the Dispensaries during the year; but though you may be unable personally to go to each institu- tion, much may be done through the Civil Medical Officers, and I am to request that you will impress on all of them the necessity of careful supervision, especially in those cases in which they have had reason to question the accuracy of the returns. Gurjun Oil. Paras. 5 and 18. Para. 148. 9. Opinions appear to differ regarding the efficacy of Gurjun oil in the treatment of leprosy. At Lucknow it would seem to have done some little good, while at Fyzabad the Civil Surgeon doubts the curative properties of the oil. Whatever the final verdict may be, the Officiating Chief Commissioner feels sure the experiment will be allowed a fair trial. King's Hospital. Para. 10. 10. The expenditure at the King's Hospital is shown to have been exactly the same as the receipts. This institution is supported from an endowment, and the Officiating Chief Commissioner presumes that your
( 4 ) statement shows only the amount actually drawn and paid away, while the real income is not shown. This gives no idea of the state of the endowment, and in future it would be more satisfactory to show as receipts the annual income from the Government securities and the balance at the credit of the endowment. If there be any difficulty in separating the accounts of this institution from those of the Unání Hospital, which is supported from the same endowment, a few explanatory remarks would be necessary. Hazratgunj Dispensary. Para. 17. 11. There being a considerable balance in favour of this Dispensary, it would, perhaps, be as well to expend it in improving the institution, or to invest it in Government securities. Balrámpur Hospital. Para. 35. 12. The accounts of the Balrámpur Hospital have now been given in an intelligible form, and show that its finances are in a flourishing condition. The annual expenditure was well within the income, and at the close of the year there was a balance of Rs. 7,112-14-6. Unao Sadr Dispensary. Para. 42. 13. It is satisfactory to note that subscriptions have increased ; but the decrease in the Government allowance from Rs. 837-8-0 to Rs, 474 should have been explained. The expenditure was more than double that of 1874, the figures being Rs. 1,775-6-5 and Rs. 4,106-8-5, but this difference is mainly owing to Rs. 1,656-15-4 having been invested in Government securities, and Rs. 494 spent on repairs. Bara Banki Sadr Dis- pensary. Para. 67. 14. The Officiating Chief Commissioner observes that the amount expended on repairs has not been shown in the Bara Banki returns. From the preceding para. it will be seen that similar expenditure has been shown at Unao, and as there should be uniformity in these returns, it is to be regretted that the information was not given here also. Sitapur Sadr Dispensary. Paras. 85 and 86. 15. The Officiating Chief Commissioner is glad to notice the increas- ing popularity of the Sitapur Dispensary, and trusts that under the care of Assistant Surgeon Nobin Chunder Dutt it will continue to improve. The accounts rendered by the Civil Surgeon of this district are far from satisfactory. According to the figures given for 1874, at page 19, the balance at the end of that year was Rs. 768-0-3, but in the next column, the balance on 1st January 1875 is shown as Rs. 487-5-9. Moreover, the expenditure for 1875 (Rs. 2,072-15-1) does not agree with the figures Rs. 2,365-6-6 given in Statement I. In this statement, there is a note to the effect that the last-mentioned sum includes Rs. 195-6-8 on account of the Mahmudabad Branch Dispensary. The expenditure for that Dispensary (Rs. 1,011-6-8) would appear (vide page 20) to be composed of the following items :( 5 ) treatment. What became of the remaining 51 is not stated, but if they are included in those that ceased to attend, it seems a large number to have left the hospital unrelieved, the more so as it appears from State- ment II. that no incurable cases were treated at this institution. Para. 105. 17. According to the figures given for the year 1874, the receipts were ... ... ... ... ... ... ... Rs. 6,216 14 5 and expenses ... ... ... ... ... ... ( 6 ) tions these officers can have paid no attention whatever to the preparation of their annual returns. You are, therefore, requested to make it under- stood that this is a part of their duties which must no longer be neglected. 26. Setting the figured statements aside, the Officiating Chief Commissioner gathers from your report that our Dispensaries are gradu- ally gaining favour with the people. It would seem, too, that the people are acquiring more confidence in our system of surgery. The popularity of the institutions must depend in a great measure on the behaviour and demeanour of the medical practitioners. This has been illustrated in a remarkable manner at the Sitapur Dispensary, and the Officiating Chief Commissioner trusts that the example may not be disregarded by your subordinates. 27. In conclusion, I am to observe that as there are now no less than 48 Hospitals and Charitable Dispensaries in the Province, the Officiating Chief Commissioner is of opinion that it will be wiser for some little time to devote our available funds to the improvement of those that already exist, rather than to expend them in opening out new institutions. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, H. J. SPARKS, Officiating Secretary to the Chief Commissioner, Oudh. PRINTED AT THE OUDH GOVERNMENT PRESS.
No. 762/C. C. FROM DOCTOR H. M. CANNON, M. B., DEPUTY SURGEON GENERAL, INDIAN MEDICAL DEPARTMENT, LUCKNOW CIRCLE, To THE SECY. TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, OUDH. Dated Lucknow, the 28th April 1876. SIR, I HAVE the honor to submit the Annual Report, with Statements I. II. and III. of the Charitable Hospitals and Dispensaries in the province of Oudh, for the year 1875. Abbreviation of report. 2. Agreeable to instructions contained in para. 8, Home Department/Medical letter No. 564, dated 25th August 1875, I have on this occasion omitted alto- gether the submission of reports on the Jails and Police Hospitals, as well as those of the Lunatic Asylum and Balrámpur Medical School. No. 68-2837, dated 21st November 1874, Home De- partment. 3. With reference to the order quoted in margin, I have en- deavoured, in preparing the Annual Reports, to limit myself to general statements gathered from a careful perusal of those of the several institu- tions in the province. I have, however, found it necessary to deviate in several instances from a strict adherence to this rule, more especially as regards the Branch Dispensaries, many of which I have had neither the time nor oppor- tunity of inspecting within the year. In such instances I have been obliged to quote freely from the reports of Civil Surgeons, as I am anxious on this occasion to bring pro- minently to the notice of the Chief Commissioner the question as to the utility of increasing or limiting the amount of in-door relief afforded by these institutions. Inspections. 4. During the year under review I have visited and reported on 47 Sadr, Branch, Jail, and Police Hospitals and Dispensaries. The Branch Dispensaries, with the exception of Jais, have all been visited at least four times by the District Medical Officers. The remarks made by me on the occasion of my inspections have been added to this report, where I have considered them necessary. NUMBER OF DlSPENSARIES. In 1874. In 1875. 6 First-class. 6 First-class. 6 Second-class. 6 Second-class. 31 Third-class. 35 Third-class. 43 47 5. The statement in the margin shows that the number of Charitable Dispensaries in the province con- tinues to increase; at the close of 1874 there were 43, and at the close of 1875 in all 47 Dispensaries. New Dispensaries. 6. Of the latter number three third-class Dispensaries were opened during 1875, viz., Mohán in Unao and Dalmau and Jais in the Rae Bareli district.
( 2 ) Comparative attendance 7. The following is a summary of the working of the Oudh Hospitals and Dispensaries for the year 1875. It will be observed on reference to statement No. 2 that as many as 243,045 patients received surgical and medical aid in the Dispensaries of this province during 1875, against 207,547 in 1874, showing an increase of 35,498 in the attendance of in and out-door patients. *RESULTS : In-door ... 601 Out-door ... 519 Total ... 1,120 8. Of the total number 243,045 that applied for medical and surgical aid, 6,121 were in-door, 236,924 were out-door; of these 191,890 were cured, 20,765 relieved, 973 incurable,* 1,120 died, 25,673 result unknown, and 2,624 remained under treatment at the end of the year. Mortality. 9. The estimate of the percentage of deaths amongst the total number treated must continue unsatisfactory so long as any attempt is made to report on the casualties among out-patients, which I again request may be omitted from future reports by all Medical Officers. On reference to comparative statement attached to the report of each Dispensary will be found the proportion of deaths to the number of in-door patients treated; but these also are in one respect faulty, as the "moribund" cases brought in by the Police do not give a fair percentage of mortality to the numbers that have actually been under medical treatement. Operations, capital and minor. 10. On reference to the following abstract statement, it will be ob- served that the capital or major operations have increased from 364 in 1874 to 593 in 1875, and the minor from 9,205 to 11,474 in the year under review; and although the trustworthiness of some of the returns from Branch Dispensaries under this heading may be viewed with suspicion, especially in the Hardoi and Unao districts, where severe fractures and dislocations have been included, it is impossible to deny the fact that the relief afforded by surgical operations alone during the year 1875, at these institutions, has been very great and very important. 11. The following comparative statement shows the number of capital and minor surgical operations in each district of the province for 1874 and 1875 :( 3 ) With reference to the above table it is worthy of remark that out of the 593 capital operations performed during the year under review, 535 are reported to have been successful. Hospitals conspicuous for number of operations. 12. The district which stands fairly first on the list for the number of important operations is Fyzabad, and they continue in gradation as follows: Lucknow, Bara Banki, Hardoi, Unao, Rae Bareli, Gonda, Sultanpur, Partabgarh, Bahraich, Kheri, and last Sitapur. Ophthalmic Surgery. 13. In a province where we have so many expert and excellent Sur- geons, it is remarkable how the subject of Ophthalmic Surgery has been permitted to lie dormant. During my late tour of inspection, I made it my duty to bring this matter prominently to the notice of all Civil Sur- geons, and removed any obstacle there might be in cultivating this branch of surgery by condemning all old and obsolete instruments, and ordering each Sadr Dispensary to be funished with one of Macnamara's improved cases. Officers and subordinates in charge of Dispensaries. 14. Of the three classes of Medical Officers in charge of Hospitals and Dispensaries in Oudh, viz., European Medical Officers of the Military and Uncovenanted Service ; secondly, Assistant Surgeons, all of whom are Bengalies ; and thirdly, Hospital Assistants, it gives me great pleasure to be able to state that I have in no instance had to bring the name of any of the first or second seriously to the notice of superior authority for in- different conduct or want of attention to their duties. As regards the third, or Hospital Assistant class, I regret to say several of them have not proved themselves qualified to hold independent charges; but this question has formed the subject of special notice. Native medical pupils. 15. The following extract from my letter, No. 717/S.G., dated 28th De- cember 1875, to the address of the Surgeon General Her Majesty's Indian Forces, expresses my opinion regarding the practice of entertaining and educating a class of lads, called Native Medical pupils, and which I have had no reason to modify :( 4 ) "Again, in a moral point of view, many of these lads are taken away from the supervision of their parents and families and posted to Regi- ments and Civil Dispensaries, where they have a greater amount of liberty than is desirable, and associate with sepoys and Hospital establishments far senior to them in years, and in many instances there is no accom- modation provided; so they are forced to find lodgings in the bazárs and cities, which must sooner or later end in demoralization and ruin, and render every attempt useless to again bring them under discipline, as is amply proved by the numbers annually dismissed from the Hospitals and several Medical Schools." Requirements. 16. Several of the Sadr Dispensaries are rendered inefficient for the want of a properly constructed dead-house and contagious disease ward, and I trust the Chief Commissioner will move the local authorities to add these buildings where they do not exist, as soon as the local funds are prepared to meet the expense. Financial statement. 17. Statement No. I., attached to this report, gives at a glance the receipts and expenditure of all the Hospitals and Dispensaries in Oudh, under the several headings, for the year 1875. 18. It is satisfactory to note that although the number of patients treated rose from 207,547 to 243,045 and 3 new Branch Dispensaries were added to the list, the total cost of 47 Dispensaries in 1875 was only Rs 93,004-2-9 against 84,034-4-10 in 1874. 19. The cost of dieting each in-door patient in the 47 Sadr and Branch Dispensaries in the province averages about 7 pie per diem during the year under review. 20. In concluding this report, I beg to offer for the consideration of the Chief Commissioner the following remarks and suggestions after more than 2 years' experience as administrative Medical Officer in this province. * Unao. Kheri. Baru Banki. Sultanpur. Hardoi. 21. Of the 12 Sadr Hospitals and Dispensaries in Oudh, the 5* noted in margin are in charge of Hospital Assistants only, and I beg to urge that however competent and trustworthy these men may be consider- ed individually, they are not as a rule sufficiently qualified to render such important surgical and medical aid as the public have a right to expect at a Sadr Dispensary, and which is absolutely necessary to make these expensive institutions more useful and popular than they are at present. I therefore trust the Government will agree with me as to the necessity of appointing a well-qualified Assistant Surgeon to every Sadr Hospital and Dispensary in Oudh, so as to ensure the presence of an efficient Medical man at the head-quarters of each district during the absence of the Civil Surgeon on privilege leave, sanitary inspections, and other duties. 22. The Branch Dispensaries should, in my opinion, with very special exceptions, be confined to affording medical advice to out-door patients only, and where an exception is made, a well-qualified 1st class man should be posted to the charge ; at present many of these outlying Dis- pensaries are in the hands of young, untried, 3rd-class Hospital Assistants.
( 5 ) 23. All severe and important Surgical and Medical cases should be induced, if possible, to go into the Sadr Dispensaries of their District for treatment. This arrangement would result in a great saving in many ways in useless monthly outlay in diet, ward furniture, bedding, and other con- tingencies for house-patients, not unfrequently incurred by untrust- worthy Native Doctors and young Hospital Assistants, where the funds will not admit of higher-graded men of tried character being enter- tained. 24. These Branch Dispensaries for out-patients only might then be entrusted to 3rd-class Hospital Assistants and passed Balrámpur Medical School pupils on very reduced salaries, and the Sadr institutions would then be sought for when necessary, where superior surgical and medical aid was required. 25. It would not be a bad arrangement out of the savings caused by closing in-door relief at many of the Branch Dispensaries to institute a small fund for the carriage of severe and helpless cases to the Sadr Hos- pital of each District for treatment; which system, if encouraged and thoroughly carried out, would render these institutions of immense value and importance throughout the province. Conclusion. 26. I have endeavoured to limit my report as much as possible to a careful review of the statistics and a few remarks on subjects of interest; but I trust the Chief Commissioner will consider it sufficiently full to illus- trate clearly the working of all the Charitable Dispensaries under review. 27. I regret it has not been in my power to visit several of the Branch Dispensaries; but it must be remembered the Lucknow Circle includes Rohilkhund and Kamaon, which contain 11 Regimental and 9 Lock-Hos- pitals, and that in addition to the legitimate duties of a Deputy Surgeon General, I have added the work and responsibility of an Inspector General of Dispensaries, which renders it absolutely impossible for me to visit more than three-fourths of my civil charge in Oudh during the year, although I commenced my inspections as early as the month of September. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, H. M. CANNON, M. B., Deputy Surgeon General, Indian Medical Department, Lucknow Circle.
King's Hospital, City Lucknow. 1. This institution still holds its own as one of the most popular and best-managed medical institutions in the Province. 2. The total number of persons treated were 9,956 in 1875 against 9,834 in 1874. The increase is not confined to out-door patients, but is also observed among those seeking in-door relief. 3. The total number of in-door patients was 453 against 438 in 1874, showing an increase of 15; of these 329 were cured, 76 died, 12 left while under treatment, and 36 remained at the end of the year. 4. There have been 27 capital and 901 minor operations; of the former, 8 were performed by the Civil Surgeon, and 19 by the Assist- ant Surgeon Nobin Chunder Mitter; of these 26 were successful. The above include several fractures and dislocations which are not registered as operations. 5. Country medicines have been extensively used at this institution. The Gurjun oil treatment of leprosy was tried during the year, regarding which a special report has been submitted, and, although the number of cases so treated is small, its efficacy in arresting the progress of the disease, in several instances, warrants further and more extended trial. It is yet to be seen how much success is due to improved living, com- fortable quarters, and the employment of friction, and how much to the employment of the specific remedy. 6. The total expenditure, including the cost of European medicines, was Rs. 7,334-9-9 against Rs. 7,505-0-4 in 1874 ; the decrease is mainly attributable to the cheap rate of articles of diet which prevailed last year. 7. I made my annual inspection of this hospital on the 17th January 1876. The conduct and professional qualifications of Assistant Surgeon Nobin Chunder Mitter are too well-known for me to say more, than I have had no reason to alter the high opinion I have always entertained of him in every respect. 8. First Class Hospital Assistant Meer Nasur Ali, and the three Native medical pupils attached to this hospital have conducted themselves to my satisfaction, and the latter have made fair progress in their studies. 9. The new Bengal dispensary forms were introduced on the 1st January, and are found much simpler and quite as useful as those of the North-Western Provinces.
( 2 ) 10. The comparative statement is published below :( 3 ) 17. Of this were paid for establishment Rs. 1,056, for bazar medicines Rs. 631-3-0, for contingencies Rs. 239-5-0, total Rs. 1,926-8-0. There still remains to be paid the bill for Europe medicines, not yet received from Allahabad. This will probably be about Rs. 450. The balance in the Treasury at the end of 1875 was Rs. 2,269-7-7. 18. Three patients were treated with Gurjun oil for leprosy; but they did not attend regularly for their rubbing, and did not do it them- selves at their own homes. The anæsthetic patch on the left thigh of one of the patients was benefited, the rest showed no sign of improvement. 19. Establishment.( 4 ) BALRÁMPUR HOS- PITAL, LUCKNOW. 25. On reference to the annual returns of this institution, it will be found that the total number of persons who received treatment during the year rose from 10,161 in 1874 to 11,076 in 1875, and that the increase was among the out-patients only, as the number of in-door patients fell from 718 to 667. 26. Of these, 486 were discharged, cured, or relieved, 11 left the hospital while still under treatment, 143 died, and 27 remained in hospital at the end of the year. 27. Of the 10,409 out-patients 138 remained under treatment at the close of the year, and 8,857 were cured or relieved. In the case of the 1,414 out-patients who ceased to attend the result is unknown. 28. Among the total treated during the year are 658 Europeans and Eurasians, 44 of whom were treated as in-door patients and 5 died, and 614 as out-door patients, who were discharged cured or relieved. 29. There were 23 capital and 1,626 minor operations performed during 1875 ; of the former, 2 were by the Civil Surgeon, and the remain- der by Assistant Surgeon Ishan Chunder Roy, M. B.; all the cases proved more or less successful, none died. 30. In addition to the above, there were about 100 fractures and dislocations, and 62 cholera cases treated in hospital during the past year. 31. I made my annual inspection of this hospital on the 20th Janu- ary 1876, and found everything in connection with the building, conser- vancy, and medical arrangements in excellent order. The instruments and medicines were carefully kept, the book accounts and records were complete and written up to date. 32. Third Grade Assistant Surgeon Ishan Chunder Roy has been in resident medical charge during the whole year ; he has conducted his duties satisfactorily, and his qualifications are of a high order. 33. Third Class Hospital Assistant Ram Tahal is well qualified professionally, and possesses a competent knowledge of English ; he has conducted himself to Dr. Whishaw's satisfaction. 34. The three medical pupils Ahmed Khan, Prag Singh, and Laltoo Ram have all conducted themselves properly, and made satisfactory pro- gress in their medical studies. 35. In the following comparative statement it will be seen that the receipts and disbursements of 1874 do not agree with the figures given in my last annual report. In the former accounts only those sums were entered which actually passed through the hands of the officer in charge of the hospital: no notice, for example, was taken of a loan made from the hospital funds to the Balrámpur Medical School; this has been corrected and the present account shows the real state of the finances. There is this difference too in the disbursements, the former accounts showed what was due for the year, the figures now submitted show what was actually spent during the year. Thus, salaries for December 1873, paid in January 1874, are now shown under 1874, and those for December 1874, disbursed in January 1875, appear under 1875.
( 5 ) 36. A considerable decrease in expenditure will be observed under the following headings :( 6 ) 38. At the end of 1874 there were under treatment 89 patients ; admitted since, in-door 288, out-door 6,378, or a total of 6,755 ; of these, 209 in-door and 5,926 out-door patients were relieved or cured, 493 ceased to attend, 31 died in hospital, and 1 casualty alone is recorded as occurring out of the institution. At the close of the year there remained 13 in and 82 out-door patients, giving a daily average of 13.49 in and 49.14 out-door patients. There was a decline of 672 in the daily registration of out-door visits as compared with 1874. 39. The total number of capital surgical operations was 48, being 37 more than in the previous year ; of these, 41 were successfully per- formed. In the total number recorded, fractures and dislocations are included ; all but one of the major operations were performed by the Civil Surgeon ; of the 244 minor, 208 were done by the Hospital Assistant. 40. It will be observed that the mortality was unusually high as compared with 1874, 31 against 12 of that year; of these 41 suc- cumbed to diarrh( 7 ) excellent, and he is much esteemed by both European and Native resi- dents ; nevertheless, I am of opinion that a regularly trained and efficient Assistant Surgeon should be attached to this Sadr dispensary. 45. The two native medical pupils Rahmutoollah and Shafaut- oolah were attentive to their duties, and were sent to the Patna Medical College on the 1st June 1875. The three native medical pupils at present serving, Heeralall, Durbareelall, and Kalka Pershad, are reported attentive and well conducted. 46. I made my annual inspection in company with Surgeon Chose. The records and instruments were all in good order, with the exception of an old and obsolete eye-case, which was ordered to be returned into store and a new one indented for. I again urged my repeated opinion on the committee regarding the absolute necessity of providing accommoda- tion for the hospital establishment and the addition of a dead-house, and I cannot too strongly impress upon them the importance of such additions.

It is an important institution, affording a considerable amount of both in-door and out-door relief, but I regret to say that unfavourable reports have been received regarding Heedayatoollah Khan, the native doctor in charge, owing to his repeated neglect of duty and general carelessness. A special report of his conduct has been called for from the Civil Surgeon, at the expiration of the six months trial accorded him. 48. There has been a gradual falling off in attendance both of in and out-patients( 9 ) Receipts. 1874. 1875. RECEIPTS. Rs. A. P. Rs. A. P. Balance in hand on 1st January ... ... ... ... ...

Situated 20 miles from the Sadr, this small dispensary has con- tinued steadily to advance, affording a considerable amount of relief to both in and out-patients. The accommodation for in-door patients is very bad and limited, consequently its advancement has not been so rapid as it might have been. 55. During the year under review 207 in and 4,258 out-door patients presented themselves for treatment ; of these, including 37 remaining from previous year, 184 in and 3,214 out-door cases were relieved or cured, which shows a remarkable increase on 1874, when only 51 in and 2,987 out-door patients were relieved or cured ; 957 ceased to attend, four died in hospital, and 98 out patients are said to have died ; this is a great increase of mortality on 1874, or 98 against 11. At the close of the year there remained 45 on the rolls. The daily average attendance was 4.97 in and 44.38 out patients against 2.9 in and 40.14 out during 1874. 56. Of 25 capital surgical operations performed during the year by the Hospital Assistant, 23 are reported as successful; many of the cases were fractures and dislocations. 57. Third Class Hospital Assistant Ghoolam Mohee-ood-deen has been in charge throughout the year, and has given satisfaction, and his conduct is reported as good. PURWA BRANCH DISPENSARY. 1874. 1875.

PENSARY 58. This branch dispensary is still in embryo, having only been opened on the 17th May 1875. It consists of a small building, rented at Rs. 5 per mensem, for the accommodation of in-door patients, the Hos- pital Assistant's quarters being provided at Re. 1 per mensem. Its locality is about six miles from the Harowni railway station and 20 from the Sadr. There are at present no quarters for the dispensary estab- lishment. 59. Since the opening of the institution, 11 in and 2,174 out-door patients have received relief; of these, 9 in and 2,123 out-door patients are recorded as relieved or cured, 19 ceased to attend, and there remained at the close of the year 1 in and 33 out patients. The daily average attend- ance was 1.05 in and 33.38 out patients, or a total of 34.43. 60. The number of capital surgical operations (21) is very high, and all are recorded as successful. These figures include fractures and dislocations. 6l. The dispensary has been during the whole period under the charge of Third Class Hospital Assistant Gholam Ahmud, whose conduct is reported on as satisfactory. 62. The chief complaints treated in order of frequency were fevers 352, chest complaints 284, abdominal affections 240. On the whole, I consider that this branch establishment is working satis- factorily.

The returns show a slight falling off in the total numbers treated ; but this I entirely attribute to the healthiness of the season, as the dispensary can bear comparison with any in the Province for po- pularity and the admirable arrangements for the care and treatment of the sick who apply for medical aid. 64. The admissions among the in-door patients fell from 640 in 1874 to 588 in 1875 ; the attendance of out patients rose from 6,484 to 6,499. 65. Of the 35 capital operations, 19 were performed by the Civil Surgeon and 16 by the Hospital Assistant; 2 only were unsuccessful. In addition, to the above, there were 334 minor operations, which do not include setting of fractures and dislocations. 66. The great diminution in the Government allowance and expen- diture is owing to the decrease in the charge for European medicines and instruments which had to be supplied in 1874; and owing to the more extensive use of bazaar medicines there was a larger quantity of English drugs in store at the end of the year 1874.
( 12 ) 67. Another cause of the decrease under the head of expenditure is that the cost of repairs, formerly charged to the dispensary fund, was met in 1875 from other sources. 68. Dr. Franklin held medical charge during 1875, and to him is due the popularity which this well-managed institution has acquired. 69. I inspected the dispensary with Dr. Selous on the 13th of March 1876, and found everything in connection with the building, conservancy, and medical arrangements in excellent order. The books and records were neatly kept and up to date, the quarterly sheets and circulars, Indian Medical Department, are complete and bound up to the end of 1874; there were no complaints, and everything reflects the greatest credit on the management. 70. The establishment have been well conducted. First Class Hospital Assistant Sheikh Hingun is an attentive, trustworthy medical subordinate, and is well qualified in English and arithmetic. 71. The two medical pupils Quiamooddeen and Kaleemooddeen have behaved well and made fair progress in their studies, but neither have qualified in English. BARA BANKI SADR DISPENSARY. 1874. 1875.

The annual returns of this institution show that its popularity and usefulness have in some respects greatly increased, especially during the last three months of 1875, or since the new Assistant Surgeon was appointed. 86. The total number of persons that sought surgical and medical aid rose from 7,743 in 1874 to 11,186 in 1875 ; in fact, Sitapur stands at the head of the list among the Oudh dispensaries for the numbers treated during the year under review.
( 18 ) 87. The increase, however, was among the out patients only, as the in-door admissions fell from 232 to 214, or from a daily average of 11.6 to 10.54. Of these 180 were discharged cured or relieved, 16 died, 3 left while under treatment, and 15 remained in hospital at the end of the year. 88. Although it will be found that the capital operations have in- creased from 8 in 1874 to 13 in 1875, 11 of which were successful, this is a very small number for a large Sadr dispensary, especially in a district which can boast of only one branch dispensary ; but this institution has never drawn its fair proportion of surgical cases or in-door patients, which I have in former reports attributed to the brusque manner of the late Assistant Surgeon Tareenee Churn Dutt, who was relieved by Assistant Surgeon Nobin Chunder Dutt from Calcutta in October last, so that I have every reason to hope there will be an improvement in this respect for the future, now that the supposed cause of the want of appreciation of this institution has been removed. 89. I find the following remarks entered by me in the visitor's book on the 23rd of September last; they were forwarded at the time to the Commissioner of the Division for his information :( 19 ) 90. I regret to say that up to this date (the 15th April) I have been unable to obtain a correct financial statement of the receipts and expenditure of this institution, and must, therefore, submit this report without it, as too much delay has already occurred in forwarding it to Government.

During my visits to the dispensary I saw evidence of increas- ed attendance, everything was in order, the registers accurately kept up to date, the hospital assistant at his work, and a large number of out-door patients being attended to. 94. The returns show the diseases treated to be those usually met with at dispensaries,( 21 ) 97. The total number of persons to whom medical aid was afforded was 9,448 ; 447 of these were treated as in-door patients, 9,001 receiving out-door relief; 722 cases ceased to attend, result of treatment consequently unknown ; 15 in patients died, and 6 casualties were reported out of hospital; 94 cases remained under treatment at the close of the year. 98. Seventy-six major operations were performed, of which 14 were for removal of stone from the bladder; of these, were successfully done by First Class Hospital Assistant Bindrabun Dass and 7 by the Civil Surgeon, Dr. Logg. No fatal case is recorded. All the remaining operations, major and minor, 803 in number, were performed by the hos- pital assistant abovenamed. 99. There were 25 cases of cholera, of which 18 are said to have recovered, and 1,123 cases of fevers (with 3 casualties), being 348 in excess of last year. 100. I made my annual inspection of this dispensary in company with Dr. Logg on the 12th December 1875. There were at the time 14 in-door patients under treatment; from the records this appears about the daily average during the year. The attendance of out-door patients averages about 88. 101. The books, instruments, and medicines were all in good order, and had been carefully kept. The quarterly sheets of circulars and general orders were complete up to March 1875, and bound up to 1874. 102. Of the two native medical pupils attached to this institution, Puttoo Lall was dismissed the service; and native medical pupil Sheo Gobind, although a lad of ability who gave fair answers when ex- amined by me, is reported as careless and inattentive, and has been warned that unless he improves he will be recommended for dismissal. 103. First Class Hospital Assistant Bindrabun Dass is an intel- ligent, well-educated man and a fair operator, but is very dilatory in submitting his monthly returns in spite of repeated warnings ; but it is to be hoped this will not occur again. 104. This is one of those institutions to which I am of opinion an Assistant Surgeon with proper professional acquirements should be attached, as the Superintendent has frequently to absent himself on tours of inspection as sanitary officer and visiting the branch dispensaries in his district. 105. The financial condition of the dispensary will be found in the following comparative statement:( 22 ) HARDOI SADR DISPENSARY. 1874. 1875.

This institution continues to improve, and I have cause to be satisfied with its general management. Dr. Logg, the Civil Surgeon, reports favourably on the conduct and qualifications of First Class Hospital Assistant Dhunpal. 107. On the 31st December 1874, there remained under treatment 136 cases. In 1875, 23 in and 8,294 out-door patients were admitted, being 459 more than during the previous year. Of the whole number of persons (8,453) who visited the dispensary and received medicines and medical aid, 7,373 were relieved or cured, 909 absconded, the result of whose treatment is unknown, being less by 8 than in the former year; 7 deaths are reported, 2 amongst the in-door patients, and 5 occurred elsewhere. 108. The surgical operations performed during the period under review were 13 major and 377 minor, or an excess of 1 and 32 respect- ively as compared with 1874 ; the number that were successful have not been reported.
( 23 ) 109. There were not very many cases of fever during the year, but skin diseases, rheumatism and abdominal complaints held the highest places respectively.

From the returns of this Branch Dispensary it will be observed that the total number of persons registered as receiving medical aid was (including 84 cases who remained from previous year) 6578 ; of the new comers 151 were admitted as in-door patients, while 6343 received out-door relief; 1650 absconded and consequently the result of treatment is unknown. 111. Of those admitted into hospital 2 died. 6 cases are reported as having succumbed to disease at their homes. At the close of the year 1875 there were still under treatment 63 cases, none of a serious nature. 112. The daily averages of in-door and out-door patients were less than in 1874 for reasons hereinafter mentioned, but the apparent, decline of the institution is more marked when the number of operations performed in 1875 is contrasted with that of 1874, which latter return showed 17 against 5 major, and 742 against 247 minor operations
( 24 ) successfully treated in 1875. I attribute the falling off entirely to the trustworthiness of the returns under the present incumbent first Class Hospital Assistant Lalla Kali Churn, in comparison with those rendered by Hospital Assistant Lalla Ram Sahai who was removed from his appointment for carelessness and insubordination. 113. There was a large proportion of fever cases during the period under review : 950 patients received treatment for this alone, whilst 2450 are returned under the heading of " other diseases." 114. I am well satisfied with the present working of this Branch establishment as the returns are now I believe carefully and accurately kept, which was certainly not the case under the former Hospital Assist- ant in charge.

At the commencement of the year there were 90 cases under treatment; the prosperity of the dispensary is marked by the increase both amongst the in and out-door attendance, there being 551 in-door and 8,419 out-door patients as compared with 536 in and 7,828 out-door during 1874, or a total treated during the past 12 months of 9,060 against 8,448 in 1874, showing an increase of 612.
( 25 ) 116. Of the total number of persons who received the benefits of the institution, 517 in and 7,990 out-door patients were cured or relieved, 408 are not accounted for, having ceased to attend, which exceeds those of 1874 by 53. There were 12 deaths, 4 of which are recorded as having occurred out of hospital. At the close of the year there were 7 in and 126 out-door patients on the rolls. The daily average attendance was 9.84 in and 97.77 out-door.patients, exceeding that of the prervious year by .8 in and 22.57 out-door sick. 117. The number of surgical operations performed increased from 25 to 70 amongst capital cases, or a difference) of 45. Removal of tumours 9, deep abscesses 21, deep abscess of knee-joint 1, abdominal 5, reduction of dislocation 34; all successfully performed. The minor operations were 380 against 383 of 1874. 118. The dispensary is under charge of Second Class Hospital As- sistant Noor Mahomed, who performed all the operations, and is reported by the Civil Surgeon as possessing good qualifications; he is very attentive to his duties, and has always given satisfaction. 119. I have no cause to find any fault with the general state of the institution. The instruments and other property of Government are all clean and cared for, and the medicines kept in their proper places. BILGRÁM BRANCH DISPENSARY. 1874. 1875.

( 26 ) KHERI DISPENSARIES. 120. There are five dispensaries in this district : one at the Sadr, one at Gola twenty miles west, one at Muhamdi forty miles west, one at Singáhi twenty eight miles north, and one at Dhaurahra twenty- five miles cast; there is also a dispensary at Duduaghat under charge of the Hospital Assistant attached to the Forest Department ; in December Europe medicines, to the value of Rs. 100 paid from Local Funds, were supplied to this institution, and, I believe, it is to be placed under the superintendence of the Civil Surgeon. KHERI SADR DISPENSARY, 121. A description of the Sadr dispensary has been given in former reports; it and its out-offices are in capital repair; the female hospital consists of six separate rooms, eight feet square each, opening on to a yard common to all, which has an enclosure Avail six feet high ; the privacy of each and all is thus complete. 122. The dispensary is well supplied with almirahs, tables, char- pais, and such necessaries; for each bed there is a mattress, a dari, and a blanket. 123. The supply of medicines has been sufficient; indigenous drugs can be purchased in the local bazaar, and are constantly used ; the instruments are kept in good order ; the poisons are kept separate from other medicines. 124. The Sadr dispensary is visited daily by the Civil Surgeon ; the year 1875 has been a tolerably healthy one, cholera was present in all parts of the district from March till November, but only 721 cases were reported in this time ; malarious fever was very prevalent but not of a very fatal type. The people living round about the Sadr are more favourably situated, and enjoy better health generally than those in out-lying parts. 3,127 out-door and 162 in-door patients were treated at the Sadr dispensary during the year, plus 38 remaining at the end of 1874 Of these 3,508 were cured, 39 ceased to attend, 12 in-door patients died, and AG patients remained at the end of the year; the diseases chiefly treated were fevers 952 cases, dysentery, diarrhoea, constipation, &c. 600 cases, diseases of the eye 123 cases, pneumonia bronchitis, 230 cases, and diseases of the skin 774. 110 cases of injuries were treated, including fractures, dislocations, contusions, and wounds. 125. All the 15 important operations were performed by the Superintendent, Dr. Higginson ; of these 13 were successful. They in- clude the lateral operation for lithotomy, a thigh amputation, removal of tumours, reduction of compound fractures and dislocations, &c. 126. Out of 162 in-door patients 12 died ; the causes of death were phthisis pulmonalis, apoplexy, pneumonia, endocarditis, obstruction of the bowels, and acute inflammation of the bladder ; post mortem examin- ation of one of the cases of obstruction of the bowels showed that the cause was a cancerous tumour, the size of a cocoanut, completely investing the ilium. 127. Second Class Hospital Assistant Rajub Khan has been in charge of the Sadr dispensary throughout the year ; he is a man of very
( 27 ) fair professional attainments, and is attentive to his duties, he writes and speaks English. Native medical pupil Saduk Ali joined the dispensary in June; he is an attentive intelligent lad, and has picked up a good deal of knowledge since his arrival. 128. This dispensary was inspected by me on the 21st of March last. I found the records, medicines, and surgical instruments all in good order, with the exception of the eye-case, which is useless and should be returned, and a new set of MacNamara's indented for. 129. Although Second Class Hospital Assistant Rajub Khan bears a good character, is attentive to his duties, and has a fair knowledge of English, he is scarcely qualified for the charge of so important a Sadr dispensary, and I strongly recommend that an Assistant Surgeon may be appointed in his place. 130. The financial state of this institution will be found in the following comparative statement:( 28 ) MUHAMDI BRANCH DISPENSARY. 131. Dr. Higginson reports that the Mohamdi Branch dispensary, similar in construction to that at Gola, is one of the old institutions of the district; it is under the charge of First Class Hospital Assistant Jehangeer Khan, who continues to deserve the high character he has always borne In April last, having completed fourteen years' service, he passed success- fully the professional examination and was promoted to the first class ; the dispensary is situated in one of the largest towns in the district. 3,221 out patients and 253 in patients, plus 53 remaining from last report,received medical relief during the year; of these 3,119 were relieved or cured, 331 ceased to attend, and 14 died; the chief diseases were fevers 1,607 cases, ophthalmia 182 cases, affections of the skin 396 cases, dysentery, diarrh( 29 ) GOLA BRANCH DIS- PENSARY. *And 27 who remained under treatment at the end of 1874. 133. Regarding the Gola branch dispensary Dr. Higginson reports as follows: ( 30 ) DHAURAHRA BRANCH DISPENSARY. 134. Dr. Higginson reports as follows :( 31 ) " I have more than once found the instruments and hospital necessaries in " a very discreditable state ; 1,963 out-door and 81 in-door patients were " admitted during the year; of the total treated 1,943 were relieved or cured, " 72 ceased to attend, and 10 died ; the chief disease met with at this dis- " pensary is goitre, 1,085 cases were treated, of which 1,034 are reported to " have been relieved or cured ; of fevers there were only 263 cases, "rheumatism 112 cases, dysentery, diarrh( 32 ) FYZABAD SADR DISPENSARY. 137. The roof of the main building is still in the unsatisfactory state it was in at the date of last report. The want of sufficient funds is the reason stated why nothing has as yet been done to strengthen it. The weakest parts are, however, propped up, and there is little or no dan- ger of a catastrophe occurring ; the estimate to put the roof and building in thorough repair exceeds, I believe, Rs. 5,000. 138. The Assistant Surgeon's quarters having been found insuffi- cient for the accommodation of his family, a requisition has been sent in for the addition of a room, a few servants' houses and a stable, but as the quarters are quite as extensive as those allowed at Gonda or Bah- raich, I agree with the Commissioner, who considers any expenditure on this account unnecessary. 139. The want of a dead-house has been much felt, not only for the safe keeping of corpses until burial or other arrangements can be made, but also for operation on the dead body and for anatomical de- monstrations to the medical pupils attached to the dispensary. 140. The European subscriptions amounted to Rs. 295-4-0 against Rs. 345-8-0 in 1874, or a decrease of Rs. 50-4-0, which appears to be due to fluctuations in the number of European residents. The native sub- scriptions have also fallen off considerably. The Government contribu- tion was Rs. 1,296, the pay of the Assistant Surgeon and a compounder. The provision from Local Rates was Rs. 824-9-11 against Rs. 776-8-3 in the previous year. Thus the total income for the year, including the balance on hand at the close of 1874, was Rs. 3,613-9-11. 141. The establishment cost Rs. 1,733-13-0, or only 3 annas in ex- cess of the previous year. The dieting of in-door patients came to Rs. 335-5-6, or Rs. 73-15-0 less than in that year. Bazaar medicines and contingencies cost Rs. 41-13-6 and Rs. 21-7-4 less, respectively, than in 1874. 142. The total expenditure for the year was Rs. 2,350-0-2 against Rs. 2,509-1-0 in 1874, or a decrease of Rs. 159-1-2 ; at the close of the year there was a balance of Rs. 1,263-9-9 in favour of the dispensary. 143. The average cost per head per diem for dieting in-door patients was 12 pies (1 anna), or 3 pies less than in the previous year. The great- er cheapness of food and the smaller number of Europeans dieted during the year account for this. 144. The total number admitted in-door and out-door were 253 and 5,212, respectively, against 339 and 5,123 in the previous year. This shows a considerable falling off in the number of in-door patients, but as there was more than a corresponding increase in the out-door, the result is in favour of the year under report. Of the total number treated (in-door and out-door) 4,021 were cured, 1,407 ceased to attend, 72 died, and 32 (in-door 13 out-door 19) remained at the close of the year.
( 33 ) 145. The number of capital operations performed was 26 against 33 in the previous year. They were as follows :( 34 ) 152. The Superintendents during the year were Dr. J. Cameron from 1st January till 31st March. Dr. E. Selous from 1st April till 20th November. Dr. J. Cameron from 21st November till the end of the year. 153. This institution was inspected by me on the 14th September 1875, when I found the records, medicines, and instruments in good order, and the circular sheets and orders Indian Medical Department complete and bound up to the end of 1874.

This dispensary is still in its temporary quarters in the main street of the village, but it is hoped that a suitable building will be pro- vided before the end of the current year. 155. Dr. Cameron reports as follows :( 35 ) "The expenditure under all heads amounted to Rs. 1,093-8-2, " leaving a balance at the end of the year of Rs. 180-0-10. There was a " decrease of expenditure under all heads except contingencies (and here " the increase was merely nominal) as compared with 1874. " The total number treated in-door and out-door was 2,907 against " 3,258 in 1874, or a decrease of 351. The falling off was entirely in the "out-door, the in-door having been the same (109) as in the previous "year, and seems entirely due to the better health and condition of the " population in the past year. " Seventy six operations were performed by the Hospital Assistant, of "which he claims 23 as major ones, but of which probably not more than " 14 deserve that appellation. They were for the most part for cancer "and other tumours, and all were successfully performed, except one, in " which death was in all probability unavoidable. " Among the in-door the chief complaints were abdominal (spleen "and liver), fevers (agues), bowel complaints, skin and venereal, and call " for no special remarks. " Among the out-door were found chiefly skin diseases, abdominal " complaints, fever (agues), and rheumatism. Three cases of goitre " occurred, but these were probably imported, as this disease is " unknown among the residents of this part of the district. The reason " for this immunity appears to be that Shahganj is beyond the water-shed " of the Gogra, and is between two small rivers which take their rise in " the district and form the main surface drains in this direction. "First Class Hospital Assistant Ghamundee Lall has been in "charge over since the commencement of the dispensary. He has fully "maintained, in every respect, the high character given of him in " previous reports." SHAHGANJ BRANCH DISPENSARY. 1874. 1875.

Regarding this dispensary, Dr. J. Cameron, the Civil Surgeon of the district, reports as follows :( 37 ) The cost of dieting each in-door patient for a day averaged a little over 8½ pies, a very fair and moderate figure. " The number of admissions in-door, rose from 102 in 1874 to 122, " but the daily average under treatment was smaller than in that year. " The inference is that the duration of treatment was shorter. " The number of out-door was 2,844 against 3,967 in the previous year, " and the daily average attendance fell from 56.18 to 32.38. These figures " show a very considerable falling off which cannot wholly be attributa- " ble to the greater healthiness of the year. I am, on the contrary, of " opinion, that it is mainly owing to the honesty of the present incumbent. Injuries, bowel complaints, abdominal ailments, rheumatism and ague were in their order the chief among the in-door diseases. "Among the out-door the chief in the order of frequency were " fevers (agues) abdominal ailments, chest complaints, rheumatism and "skin diseases. Syphilis was rather rife. Goitre is here very common, " as it is everywhere on the banks of the river Gogra. " The deaths among the in-door were not numerous, and appear " to have been unavoidable. As regards the mortality amongst the out- " door, it is impossible to ascertain it correctly and it would therefore be " better to leave it out altogether in future returns. " Thirty-one major and 257 minor operations are claimed. The " major consisted mainly of reductions of dislocation and setting of frac- " tures, of both of which there was an inexplicable number for which the " previous hospital assistant is responsible. " The dispensary is in a very flourishing condition. It is much " appreciated not only by the people of the town but also by the dwellers " of this part of the district far and near, and not a few come for relief u from districts on the other side of the Gogra. " Second Class Hospital Assistant Bhagailoo Ram has been in charge " since May last. He is a respectable, careful, and intelligent officer, and " much liked by the people of the town.

The dispensary is still in its temporary quarters in the tahsíl compound, but the new building is in process of erection and will probab- ly be ready for occupation within the next four months. 158. Doctor Cameron reports as follows :( 39 ) " Among the out-door the chief complaints were as usual " abdominal ailments (spleen and liver), fever (ague), chest affections and " skin diseases. Syphilis and gonorrh( 40 ) isolated and are in two blocks, arranged face to face with a court-yard between to ensure privacy. 160. The old dead house has been pulled down, as it was unsafe and a new one substituted. 161. The out-offices are greatly dilapidated, some of the roofs have been blown off. This has been represented to the Deputy Commissioner who has promised the necessary additions and repairs as soon as funds can be found. The want of a ward for infectious diseases is much felt at this large dispensary. 162. The prevailing diseases here appear to have been fevers, bowel- complaints, cholera, opthalmia, and goitre. Cholera of rather a violent type prevailed in various parts of the district during April, May, and June. 163. Goitre is endemic in this district, it attacks young and old, male and female in all stations of life ; it is very common amongst the villagers along the banks of the Gogra ; it scarcely ever attacks the inhab- itants of the sadr station. 164. The number of patients admitted during the year was 9,789 out-patients against 8,561, and 323 in-door as compared with 255 in 1874 There were also 54, viz 14 in and 40 out, remaining from last year. There was a satisfactory daily average of in and out-door attendance, namely, 17.93 of the former and 50.6 of the latter. 165. There have been 24 capital operations of which 10 were per- formed by the Civil Surgeon, and 14 by the Assistant Surgeon in medi- cal charge ; of these 19 were discharged cured, three died, and two remain- ed under treatment at the end of the year. 166. The returns show the financial state of the institution as fol- lows : the year opened with a balance of Rs. 960-7-0 ; the native subscrip- tions during the year amounted to Rs. 554-4-0 ; and those from Europeans Rs. 117. The Government allowance was Rs. 1,284, and the interest on invested funds Rs. 82-8-0, giving a total for the year of Rs. 2,998-3-0. The total expenditure amounted to Rs. 2,157-3-9, leaving a balance of Rs. 92-11-5 at the end of the year. The difference Rs. 748-3-10 has been expended for the branch dispensaries which appear to have no separate dispensary fund. 167. This dispensary was inspected by me on the 13th of Septem- ber 1875, in company with Doctor Selous, who was then in visiting charge. I found everything in excellent order, there was a large attendance of in and out-door patients. Third Grade Assistant Surgeon Jadub Christo Sen is a well qualified medical officer, and a successful medical and surgical practitioner. 168.

This dispensary is situated in the town, and is a commodious well ventilated pakka building. A house for the hospital assistant, and out-offices have been completed. 170. There is a marked increase in the admission of in and out- door patients, the former having risen from 102 to 122, and the latter from 2,776 to 3,871. 171. There were no capital operations. The minor operations numbered 303 cases against 101 during 1874. 172. The financial statement is as follows: no separate subscriptions were collected for this dispensary, the year opened with a balance of Rs. 20-7-2, the Government allowance was Rs. 444 plus Rs. 331-6-11 allotted from dispensary funds, which gives a total of Rs. 795-14-1. 173. The expenditure was Rs. 444 for establishment, and Rs. 351-14-1 for diet, contingencies and bazar medicines. 174.

This dispensary is located in a building, half of which is occu- pied by the local thanah, but the Deputy Commissioner is taking steps to have separate accommodation provided, at an estimated cost of Rs. 2,500. 176. The admission of in-door patients has fallen from 50 to 34, but the out-door patients have increased from 5,430 to 6,216 during 1875. 177. There were no capital operations, but the returns show 78 of a minor character against 64 in the previous year. 178. The financial statement shows a balance of Rs. 43-6-l in the beginning of the year. The sum of Rs. 277-5-2 was paid from Dispen- sary Funds plus Rs. 804 Government allowance, making a total of Rs. 1,124-11-3 for the year under review, which appears to be balanced by the expenditure. 179. The Civil Surgeon reports that First Class Hospital Assistant Raheem Bux, in charge of this dispensary, bears a high character, and the attendance of patients recorded bears out the belief that he performs his duty in a satisfactory manner.

This branch dispensary was inspected by me on the 13th of September last, during the rains, as I was anxious to make myself per- sonally acquainted with its position and utility, and test the correctness of the returns and the advisability of its continuing to afford in-door relief. My visit was quite unexpected, and I was much pleased with everything I saw, and have no reason to question the correctness of the returns. The building is a suitable one and in good repair. 181. This is certainly one of the branch dispensaries where I should continue to afford in-door relief. It is situated in a swampy neigh- bourhood close to a large ganj near the banks of the Gogra and on the main road between Gonda and Fyzabad. 85 in-door and 7,664 out-door patients were treated during the year. 182. The operations were 69 of a minor character compared with five in the year 1874. 183. The diseases were principally fevers, rheumatism, and goitre. 184.

I made my annual inspection of this institution, in company with the Civil Surgeon Dr. Mulvany, on the 26th February 1876. 186. Dr. Mulvany succeeded Dr. Franklin of Bara Banki, who was only in visiting medical charge, and entered on his duties as Civil Surgeon on the 17th May 1875. 187. At the time of my visit there were 16 in-door patients, several of which were important surgical cases The out-door patients' attend- ance was that day 50. 188. Everything in connection with the dispensary with the excep- tion of the latrine arrangements, which admit of improvement, was in excellent order. The privies are too near the main building, and the system of dry earth conservancy is not sufficiently attended to. In fact the hospital, as a building, is not what could be desired for so important and popular an institution, but as I wrote so fully on this subject last year, and I believe it now occupies the attention of the authorities, I will not recapitulate here. 189. The instruments were all complete and in good order, with the exception of the electro-magnetic machine, hypodermic syringe, and a case of eye instruments, which should be replaced.
( 45 ) 190. During the past year the actual number admitted into the hos- pital was 163, and the out-door attendance was 8,854, total 9,017, or grand total 9,063 being in excess by 932 of 1874. Of the above 1,424 ceased to attend, result of treatment unknown, being 370 more than the preceding year. There were 18 deaths in the Hospital, and four patients are said to have died at their homes. 191. The daily average of in-door patients was 13.72, that of out- door 61.73, showing a decided improvement since last report. 192. There were fewer surgical operations than in 1874. Of the 17 capital operations, 10 were performed by the Civil Surgeon, one by Assistant Surgeon Hara Kanto Banerjee, and six by Assistant Surgeon Nund Lall Banerjee. In 12 cases the operation was completely successful ; in three the patient died, and in two the result was unknown. Amongst the 192 minor operations are included reduction of dislocations and setting fractures. 193. The principle causes of sickness which came under treatment were as follows, in order of frequency : skin affections 1,488, fever 1,468, abdominal affections 964, and rheumatism 589. Cholera was epidemic throughout the district during May and June ; as many as 3,000 deaths were reported as having occurred in less than three months. No case was admitted into the dispensary for treatment, and the disease did not spread in the Sadr ; there were about 50 cases only amongst the pilgrims who were treated in tents outside the town by Assistant Surgeon Nund Lall Banerjee in April last. 194. The financial state of the institution is satisfactory, the expendi- ture being Rs. 79-10-7 under total receipts. The cost of dieting each patient did not exceed as a rule 8 pies per diem. 195. The institution is under the charge of Third Grade Assistant Surgeon Hara Kanto Banerjee, who received this his first charge of a Dispensary from Third Grade Assistant Surgeon Nund Lall Banerjee, transferred to Fyzabad on the 17th October last. He is reported of as being attentive to his duties and possessing good qualifications. 196. The native medical pupils, Nadir Hossein and Khoda Bux, have made fair progress in their studies, are attentive and their conduct is said to be excellent. BAHRAICH SADR DISPENSARY. 1874. 1875.

The patients still receive medicines and medical attendance in the same wretched mud huts, to which no out-offices are attached. 198. The daily increasing appreciation of this Branch Dispensary- renders it necessary that it should be removed to its new locality on the Bahraich road, about 3 miles from Hissámpur and near to Bahramghat. The foundation of this new building has been completed, but a little extra pressure is necessary to expedite completion as soon as possible. 199. The total number of patients admitted into Hospital since 1st January 1875 was 70 ; two less than in 1874. Of the in-door patients 65 were more or less relieved. Of 7,154 out-door patients 6,810 are returned as relieved or cured, 228 ceased to attend (result of treat- ment unknown), four died in Hospital, and 28 are recorded as having died at their homes ; there remained at the close of the year 3 in and 89 out patients still under treatment. 200. The daily average of in-door patients was less by 1.09, and of out-door more by 7.43 than in 1874, or in-door 2.26, out-door 61.57, as compared with 3.35 and 54.19 in 1874. 201. There were no surgical operations of any great importance ; 293 minor were performed by First Class Hospital Assistant Shoo Rutton Dass, who was in charge of the Dispensary, and whose conduct and qualifi- cations are reported as good, and whose kindness and attention to the sick have rendered the institution very popular.

This is a small Branch Dispensary, and owing to the want of out- offices it is not adapted for receiving in-door patients for treatment ; the want will be supplied by the Public Works Department, probably before the setting in of the rains. The institution is under the charge of Third Class Hospital Assistant Lootf Ali, who is well educated, keeps all his re- cords in English, has a fair knowledge of his profession, and bears a good character. 203. The total number of out-door patients who received medical at- tendance was 2,479. Of these 2,349 were relieved or cured, 105 ceased to attend, only 1 is reported as having died out of Hospital, and 24 remained under treatment at the close of the year. The total number of cases exceeded that of 1874 by 210. The daily average attendance was 25.9. 204. Seventy-five minor surgical operations were performed suc- cessfully by the Hospital Assistant. 205. The chief causes of sickness were rheumatism, and chest and bowel affections. 222 cases of cholera were treated in the surrounding villages, but none in the Dispensary.
( 48 ) 206. The financial state of this institution is on the whole satisfac- tory, as the expenditure was less than the receipts by Rs. 169-10-10. The native subscriptions amount only to Rs. 260, although the Talukdár of Bhinga is said to subscribe Rs. 26 per mensem. BHINGA DISPENSARY. 1874. 1875.

This branch dispensary is making marked improvement in the number of attendants as out-patients, the returns showing 2,860 against 2,410 in 1874, which with the 10 cases remaining under treatment on the 1st January 1875, give a total of 2,870. Of those 2,688 are returned as cured or relieved, 128 ceased to attend, and 16 are reported to have died at their homes. 38 remained on the rolls on the 31st December 1875. 208. The daily average of out-patients exceeded that of the previous 12 months by 15.35 being 31.55. There was only one minor surgical opera- tion, which is a great falling off from 1874, when 200 cases were recorded. An explanation has been called for. The principal causes of sickness were rheumatism, chest and abdominal affections, and fevers. 209. Second Class Hospital Assistant Ali Buksh took over charge of the institution from Third Class Hospital Assistant Ahmud Buksh. The present incumbent, was not educated at any college, but has acquired know- ledge from attention and experience in practice. His records are all kept carefully in English, compiled by a friend of his, and all his patients seem to be much pleased with his treatment and manner.
( 49 ) 210. In the financial account the receipts were Rs. 604-6-4, being Rs. 28-6-4 in excess of last report, but insufficient to meet the expenses of the institution, the disbursements for the year being Rs. 677-12-1 or Rs. 73-5-9 more than the receipts. I regret however that the accounts of this institution are not clear. NÁNPÁRA DISPENSARY. 1874. 1875.

This Branch Dispensary was established in 1873, and has ever since been in the charge of Third Class Hospital Assistant Jan Mahomed. He understands English and speaks the language fairly. His qualifications are above the average of the Third class, but somehow I am inclined to question the honesty of his returns, which show a daily average attendance of 14.13 patients in 1874 and 15.24 in 1875, although the institution is the smallest of all the Branch Dispensaries in the district, and when visited by officers has appeared almost deserted. I propose therefore to test the correctness of the statistical records by placing another Hospital Assistant in charge, and removing the present incumbent to another station. 212. The total number of patients actually under treatment during the period under review was 2,876 ; of these 2,708 are stated to have recovered or been relieved, 152 ceased to attend, 2 died it is supposed at their homes, and 14 still remain.
( 50 ) 213. The minor surgical operations are recorded as 93. 214. The financial state of the institution appears satisfactory ; the expenditure being less than the receipts by 11-8-2, although there were no European subscriptions and only Rs. 78 from natives.

This dispensary is a fine building capable of containing 30 in-door patients. On the occasion of my visit in company with Doctor Cameron, the Civil Surgeon, on the the 6th September, I was surprised to see that the roof which was reported by me as unsafe in January had not been attended to, and had consequently fallen in, the patients being treated in the poor-house and adjacent buildings. Repairs are now being executed, and I was assured by Captain Currie, the Deputy Com- missioner, who appeared to take an interest in the institution, that he would lose no time in putting the building in thorough repair and arrange for a separate lunatic ward, which is much needed. 216. The out-offices attached to this institution are in fair order, but there is great want of a dead-house which should be erected at some little distance from the hospital. The building at present used for carrying on post-mortem examinations is so utterly unfitted for the purpose, having no ventilation, with only one door, and that facing a public foot-path, that it should be removed as soon as possible, not only
( 51 ) in consequence of its inadaptability for the purpose for which it was intended, but also on account of its close proximity to the hospital wards. 217. No accommodation has as yet been provided for the hospital establishment, who in consequence have to sleep in the wards. Distinct quarters should be found for them within the compound premises. 218. The total number of patients treated during the past twelve months shew a slight increase on the former year, being 10,621 against 9,125 of 1874. Of these 347 in-door and 9,718 out-door patients were relieved or cured, 467 ceased to attend, 34 died in hospital. There remained at the close of the year 22 in and 33 out patients. The daily averages of in and out-door patients were much the same as in 1874, being 29.67 and 44 against 29.72 and 45.79. 219. The number of capital operations was 16, eight of which were performed by the Civil Surgeon, and the remainder by the Assistant Surgeon : all were successfully performed with the exception of one case. 451 minor operations are recorded, being almost the same number as in the preceding year. 220. The financial state of the dispensary is satisfactory, the expenditure being much below the receipts, or Rs. 4,127-9-10 against Rs. 8,347-13-3, a difference of Rs. 4,220-3-5. 221. The item under contingencies far exceeds that of 1874, which is accounted for by the fact that Rs. 1,153-3-2 were paid to the Depart- ment Public Works on account of repairs, &c., to the building. The actual increase in the dispensary bills was only Rs. 85-1-6. 222. The unusual amount drawn for bazaar medicines, &c., has formed the subject of enquiry, and an explanation of the cause of the steady uniformity in the monthly expenditure, regardless of the number of patients, has been called for. 223. The European subscriptions have decreased from 1874 by Rs. 65-11-6, but those of the native exceeded by Rs. 827-11-4, those of the previous year. 224. The actual balance in hand on the 31st December 1874 was Rs. 3,997-9-5, an increase of Rs. 510-15-4 over the former close. 225. The average cost per head of dieting in-door patients was much the same as in 1874, being Rs. 0-1-2¼ against Rs. 0-1-3( 52 ) as attentive, conduct good, but progress in their professional studies slow and unsatisfactory, which bears out the opinion already expressed by me in my letter transmitting this report regarding medical subordinates generally.

The financial state of the institution is satisfactory, the expendi- ture being Rs. 466-7-2 less than the receipts, although the items under bazaar medicines and contingencies are high. 230.

This branch dispensary only consists at present of a small room, rented for the purpose in the serai, and although it is unable to afford accommodation for the treatment of in-door patients, it is the means of providing a considerable amount of out-door relief. 232. The institution is supported by local funds, Government con- tributing half the salary of the hospital assistant. 233. I regret to state that the Civil Surgeon has paid but little attention apparently to this portion of his charge, as there are no records forthcoming of his ever having visited it, but this was most probably owing to his failing health. Seeing that there has been but little check on the working of this branch, I am sceptical as to the correctness of the figures recording the numbers of patients attending, and of operations performed, the aggregate of which appears unusually high. 234. The number of persons who presented themselves for treat- ment is stated as 2,195, of these 1,045 were relieved, 1,131 ceaed to attend,
( 54 ) only one is reported to have died. There remained at the close of the year 18. The daily average attendance in recorded as 24.77. This is very creditable for so recent an institution if the figures are reliable. Amongst the chief causes of sickness which came under treatment were fevers 446, skin diseases 374, abdominal complaints 332, and rheumatism 212. 235. Seven capital surgical operations are said to have been performed and all consisted of paracentesis abdominis, three of which were successful, and the results of four are unknown. There were eighty-five of minor degree, results not recorded. 236. With regard to the financial state of the institution it is satis- factory to find the expenditure far below the actual annual receipts i.e., Rs. 280-3-4, against Rs. 712-0-3. The items under bazaar medicines and contingencies have been unusually high, and an explanation has there- fore been asked for and has formed the subject of a separate correspon- dence. 237. Ever since the dispensary has been opened, it has been under the charge of Third Class Hospital Assistant Luchmee Pershad, who was reported on favorably by the late Civil Surgeon, Dr. Cameron.

This dispensary was inspected by me on the 16th September 1875. The buildings and the nature of the accommodation were de- scribed in last year's report. No additions or alterations were made during the year. 255. A quantity of furniture and bedding having been purchased during the previous year none was required during the year under report. 256. The annual supply of European medicines, hospital necessaries, &c., was received about the middle of January, and was sufficient for the requirements of the year. A few new instruments, including catheters, metallic bougies, scalpels, &c, were obtained from the depôt on annual indent. 257. The dispensary is supported partly by a Provincial grant of the Hospital Assistant's and Compounder's salaries and of European medicines and instruments, partly by private subscriptions supplemented by a grant from the Local Cess Fund. 258. The balance in hand at the end of 1874 was Rs. 74-3-8. Private subscriptions collected during the year amounted to Rs. 479. about Rs. 30 more than in the previous year. European subscriptions decreased by Rs. 105, while native subscriptions rose from Rs. 67 to Rs. 205. The grant from the Local Cess Fund was Rs. 106. 259. The total expenditure, excluding the cost of European medi- cines, &c., supplied from the Medical Depôt was Rs. l,870-12-0 compared with Rs. 1,520-15-9 in 1874. The pay of the establishment amounted to
( 60 ) Rs. 308-8-0 more than in the previous year. The increase was owing to the entertainment of a clerk on Rs.20 a month and the appointment of two medical pupils paid from Provincial Funds. 260. Dieting of in-door patients cost Rs. 190-7-4 compared with Rs. 174-10-5 the year before ; the difference is due to the increase in the number of in-door patients last year, the cost of dieting per head of in-door patient being only 8 pie against 9 pie in 1874. The cost of bazaar medi- cines was Rs. 102-9-5, an increase of Rs. 18 over that of 1874. Contin- gencies cost Rs. 132-3-1 compared with Rs. 124-11-10 the year before. 261. The total number of patients treated during the year was 4,811, of whom 411 were in-door and 4,400 out-door. Compared with the previous year these numbers show an increase of 89 in-door and a decrease of 121 out-door patients. The number of the latter was, how- ever, still considerably above the average of the previous five years, as will be seen from the following statement:( 61 ) the Civil Surgeon, the remainder, along with the great majority of the minor operations, were performed by Bhyro Pershad Pattuck, Hospital Assistant of the 1st class, who was attached to the dispensary throughout the year, He is thoroughly qualified and has had long experience, and did his work satisfactorily during the year. I consider, however, that an Assistant Surgeon should be posted to the charge of this important dis- pensary. SULTANPUR SADR DISPENSARY. 1874. 1875.

I was " inclined to think that the numbers shown in the returns as having been " treated were probably correct, though the returns in other respects were " false, but the experience of the past year, during which the dispensary has " been under a Hospital Assistant who is both a capable man and one who, " I am convinced, does not shirk his work, leads me to think I was deceived. " The smallness of the number of patients compared with that of the " Amethi dispensary is to be accounted for by the fact that the latter is " situated in the midst of a good sized town and the latter is not. " Perhaps when the new building is erected the dispensary will be- " come better known. "The daily average attendance was 17.51 ; of this number 12.37 " were male adults, 3.28 female adults, and 1.86 children. "There were 505 Musulmans and 1,182 Hindús. Of other castes " or classes there are 20 entered in the return, but it is not known what " they were. Probably it is a misapprehension, and they should have been " included amongst Hindús. " The number of operations performed was 43 against none in the " previous year. " Núr Muhammad Khán, Second Class Hospital Assistant, who " was in charge during the year, has a very good knowledge of his profes- " sion, and I have had no reason to find fault with the way in which he has " attended to his duties."

Dated Lucknow the 3rd April 1876. SIR, GENERAL. I AM directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No.732/C.C, dated the 4th ultimo, and its enclosures, regarding the management of the Lucknow Lunatic Asylum during the year 1875. 2. The Chief Commissioner thinks it would have been better had a comparative statement, such as has always been submitted till last year, accompanied your report. He has, however, obtained the figures from the Superintendent, and the result is given below :No. 732/C.C. FROM DOCTOR H. M. CANNON, M. B., DEPUTY SURGEON GENERAL, LUCKNOW CIRCLE, TO THE SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, OUDH. Dated Lucknow, the 4th March 1876. SIR, I HAVE the honor to submit Dr. Whishaw's Annual Report and Returns of the Lucknow Lunatic Asylum for the year 1875, together with remarks in original on the same by the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner, Lucknow, together with my own on the working of the Institution for the year under review. II. In addition to the numerous visits I have paid this Institution during the year 1875, I minutely inspected every department on the afternoon of the 17th January 1876. III. The registers show the daily average number of inmates to have been 145.54 for the year 1875. Of these 20 died in Hospital, or 13.74 per cent. to daily strength, against 20.07 per cent. for the previous year, which I think must be considered satisfactory. IV. There remained in the Asylum, on the 31st December 1874, 140 patients, and 93 were admitted for treatment during 1875, making a total of 233 individuals under treatment during 1875, of which 20 died. V. On reference to the table given below, it will be observed the death-rate during 1875 is considerably less than it has been for the last five years:( 2 ) effectually keep out the great heat in summer and the cold winds during the cold weather months, and which I have no doubt will add much to the comfort and health of the inmates. VIII. The number of worm cases treated in the Asylum, especially amongst the fresh admissions, is not very wonderful, considering the filth and garbage many lunatics will feed on from choice when not carefully watched and prevented; I have found the same thing occur amongst newly admitted prisoners in our jails in times of scarcity. IX. An assault by one lunatic on another, which might have proved very serious, took place on the 19th November 1875, during my absence on leave. X. Buccus and Dewan Singh, two prisoners, were abusing one another, about 9 o'clock in the morning. They were in the yard set apart for criminal lunatics, at one end of which is a shed then used for spinning, weaving of cloth and blankets, oil pressing, &c. The latrine of the enclosure is near the shed. XI. Neither of these men had shown any disposition to violence since their admission, but on this morning Dewan Singh, an old man, upwards of 60, began abusing Buccus. XII. After some interchange of abuse, Buccus went to the latrine, and on his way back picked up a mallet used for driving pegs into the ground. The peon on duty had his back turned at the time, and did not see the mallet in the hand of Buccus, who ran up to Dewan Singh, and struck him a violent blow on the head. He was removed to Hospital. Doctor Whishaw arrived soon after and attended to the case. XIII. He immediately reported what had occurred to the City Magistrate, who came and made an investigation. The factory was closed at once, and application was made to the Executive Engineer to separate the shed from the yard for criminals. XIV. The injured man quite recovered in two or three days. XV. With the above exception, everything in connection with this Institution has been properly conducted. XVI. First Class Hospital Assistant Luchmun Singh appears to have the same influence over the patients for which he is celebrated, and has in other respects performed his duties to my entire satisfaction. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, H. M. CANNON, M. B., Deputy Surgeon General Indian Medical Department.
No. 12. FROM THE CIVIL SURGEON AND SUPERINTENDENT OF THE LUNATIC ASYLUM, LUKNOW, TO THE DEPUTY COMMISSIONER, LUCKNOW. Dated Lucknow, the 4th February 1876. SIR, I have the honor to submit the returns for the year 1875. 2. There was no overcrowding during the year. The Asylum can accommodate in barracks alone 168 inmates, 120 males and 48 females, and there were never as many as these in the institution on any one day. 3. The total population was 233, of which 176 were males and 57 females. 68 males and 21 females were received for the first time and 2 males and 2 females had been under treatment before and were re-admit- ted for fresh attacks of insanity. 4. The daily average number of patients in hospital during 1875, viz., 24.96, is greater than usual. In the rules for the management of the Asylum, sanctioned by Government under Section 2, Act XXXVI. of 1858, it is said, " there is no necessity to remove all cases of ordinary sickness to the hospital, " but it was thought better this year to keep nearly all cases in hospital as a better means of observing the sick than is possible when they are scattered about in their exercise grounds. 5. One benefit of this was that in some mild cases of dyspepsia and bowel complaint it was found by Doctor Cameron that the patients had round worms, and many on being treated with santonine and other vermi- fuges passed worms, in greater or less numbers, and in frequent cases were cured. 6. Altogether 60 patients had santonine, of whom 43 evacuated from two or three to twenty or thirty, and 8 voided from thirty to fifty ; 9 passed no worms. Ten grains of santonine with five grains of bi-carbo- nate of soda were given morning and evening, and the next morning ten grains of santonine with one ounce of castor-oil. 7. The mortality was less during the past year than in any of the preceding nine years, the percentage of deaths to average strength of males being 12.47, of females 18.02, and of the total average population 13.74.
( 2 ) 8. Since the beginning of July the Superintendent of the Asylum has personally made a post mortem examination of every fatal case. 9. Of the twenty fatal cases, five died from chronic bowel complaints, three from phthisis, five from epilepsy, four from debility and anomia, and three from other causes. 10. Of the twenty who died, eleven were in a sickly and emaciated state on their admission to the Asylum. 11. Five of the twenty cases belonged to Lucknow. 12. Of the twenty deaths, 5 happened in January, 4 in December, and 1 in November ; that is, 10 or one-half in the cold weather. It is thought that the ventilation which is needed in the hot weather is exces- sive for the cold, and arrangements are in progress for closing the grated openings with wooden doors at night in the cold weather. 13. The districts which contributed the largest numbers of inmates to the Asylum during the past year, were Lucknow 32 and Fyzabad 22. Only one came from Sitapur, one from Hardoi, and none from Kheri; that is, two from the Sitapur Division. 14. There were 48 criminal lunatics in the Asylum during the year; a greater number than in any of the previous nine years, except 1871. The daily average number of criminals was 24.26 males, 6.46 females; total 30.73. 15. The percentage of deaths to daily average strength of criminal lunatics was remarkably low, viz. 6.50. 16. The total number of Mahomedans admitted during the year was 13 and of Hindús 79. The proportion of Mahomedans to Hindús among the general population is about 1 to 10. 17. The most common type of insanity under treatment was, as usual, acute mania. Patients having this form of insanity are a nuisance to their friends and neighbours and come prominently under the notice of the Police. 18. In no less than 50 cases is the origin of mental disease attri- buted to the use of Indian hemp in some form or other, and many patients who have indulged in this drug are cured after some months and remained well till they re-commenced their evil habits. 19. In 23 cases aberration of mind is put down to grief, anxiety, or religion. 20. Among the unknown causes of insanity, there were 134 cases in which the causes could not be properly ascertained, are probably poverty and distress, especially I would say in the city of Lucknow. 21. Mild cases are often intensified in the patients' own homes by the barbarous treatment they endure at the hands of their relations. 22. There were 56 patients treated for fever of different kinds, 55 for bowel complaints, and 59 for dyspepsia.
( 3 ) 23. The causes of death are mentioned in para. 9. 24. Rupees 663-15-0 were received for clothing, &c., manufactured in the Asylum for the use of the patients. All the clothing was made by the inmates. 25. Rupees 536-9-0 were remitted as profit to the Treasury. 26. The average cost of each patient during the year was Rs. 80-6-5. 27. No change was made in the food of the patients during the year, but the visitors contemplate recommending to increase the quantity of attá from 10 to 12 chittacks, and the ghee from ¼ to ½ a chittack daily, to give meat only to those for whom it is ordered by the Superintendent, and to increase the quantity of vegetables. 28. The employments of the lunatics were of the same kind as in for- mer years. A larger area of ground was brought under cultivation. The patients cheerfully work in the gardens and fields. The manufacture of blankets, cloth, and bedding for the Asylum has been carried on in the workshops, and the insanes have themselves made up all their clothing and it is pronounced to be of excellent quality. 29. The profits from manufactures during the last year were Rs. 163-7-0 against Rs. 130-3-6 in 1874. 30. The Darogah Lál Mahomed, Jemadár Wahied Ali, and 1st Class Hospital Assistant Luchmun Singh, have been assiduous in their duties. They treat the afflicted inmates of the Asylum with the greatest kindness and consideration. During part of the year 1st Class Hospital Assistant Sheikh Dídár Buksh, of the Huzrutgunj Dispensary, helped Luchmun Singh in the care of the Hospital, while the latter was unfor- tunately suffering from asthma. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, J C. WHISHAW, Superintendent of the Lunatic Asylum, Lucknow.
NO. 728 FROM CAPTAIN F. CURRIE, DEPUTY COMMISSIONER, LUCKNOW, TO COLONEL J. REID, COMMISSIONER, LUCKNOW. Dated Lucknow, the 21st February 1876. SIR, I have the honor to submit in original the Lunatic Asylum Report for 1875. The daily average number of patients was greater in 1875 than usual. One of the benefits of keeping all cases of ordinary sickness in Hospital was to ascertain that dyspepsia and bowel complaints were in many instances caused by worms. No theory is put forward as to what caused the worms, probably bad food before admission into the Asylum ; doubtless in some cases a predisposition to dyspepsia caused by worms was the cause of the patient's insanity. 2.Notwithstanding this plague of worms in 1875, mortality was less than in 1874, and the percentage of deaths to daily average strength of criminal lunatics was only 6.50. 3. The cold weather is the most fatal season, owing apparently to drafty ventilation. 4.The excessive consumption of Indian hemp accounted for the larger number of the patients in the Asylum. 5.No mention is made in the report as to whether any action is ever taken by the Courts on Section 15 of Act XXXVI. of 1858. 6. No mention is made in this report of the assault made by one criminal lunatic on another fellow lunatic in (I think) the month of November. The attacked lunatic was expected not to live, and the City Magis- trate made a local enquiry and full report, but though called for, that report is not forthcoming. The wounded man, Dr. Whishaw informs me, recovered. 7. To employ criminal and dangerous lunatics in industrial manufac- tures, placing in their hands weapons with which they can at any moment attack their fellow patients or their warders, appears to me a most injudi- cious measure. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, FENDALL CURRIE, Offg. Deputy Commissioner, Lucknow

REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE HOSPITALS AND DISPENSARIES IN THE PROVINCE OF OUDH, FOR THE YEAR 1876. Government Press, Allahabad, 1877.
ORDERS OF GOVERNMENT No. 728A. OF 1877 FROM THE OFFG. SECY, TO HIS HONOR THE LIEUT.-GOVR. AND CHIEF COMMR. (FOR OUDH), To THE INSPECTOR-GENERAL OF CIVIL HOSPITALS AND DISPENSARIES, N.-W. PROVINCES AND OUDH. DATED NAINI TAL, THE 6TH OCTOBER, 1877. SIR, SURGICAL DEPARTMENT. I AM directed to acknowledge the receipt of Surgeon-Major Amesbury's letter No. 24B.-B., dated the 12th June last, reporting on the Hospitals and Dispensaries in the Province of Oudh for the past year. The report was written by Surgeon-Major Amesbury at the request. of Deputy Surgeon-General Cannon, who was transferred from Oudh early in the current year. It has been considered unnecessary to print a number of separate inspection reports which accompany Dr. Amesbury's letter. 2. Para. 4.( 2 ) Officers have no means of knowing whether an out-door patient, who ceases to attend, eventually recovers or dies. With regard to in-door patients there should be no mistake. Of 6,133 in-door patients, 464 died, a percentage of 7.56 ; in the preceding year the percentage was 9.85. 7. Paras. 32-35.No. 24-B. B. FROM DR. S. C. AMESBURY, SURGEON-MAJOR, Officiating for Deputy Surgeon-General, Oudh, To THE SECY. TO HIS HONOUR THE LIEUT.-GOVR., N.-W. P., AND CHIEF COMMR. FOR OUDH. Dated Lucknow, the 12th June, 1877. SIR, I HAVE the honour to forward my report and the accompanying statements, showing the working of the Hospitals and Dispensaries in the Province of Oudh, for submission to His Honour the Lieutenant- Governor, North-Western Provinces. 2. This report has been drawn out, as closely as circumstances would permit, in accordance with the instructions lately received in Go- vernment Resolution No. 129, dated 21st February, 1877, but which reached this office too late to allow of its being taken advantage of for the preparation of the returns and statements for 1876. 3. The reports are of necessity collated from records supplied to me by the various medical officers, supplemented by the notes of the late Deputy Surgeon-General in such instances where the dispensaries were visited by him in his annual tour of inspection. Of the returns of the 48 dispensaries 16, many teeming with errors, had to be returned for cor- rection. 4. I regret so much unavoidable delay has already occurred in the submission of the above, but this has been mainly due to the non-receipt of the necessary documents and statements from the various medical officers, and which in many instances had to be returned more than once for correction and explanation ; indeed, all the necessary records were not corrected and returned to this office until the 23rd of May, 1877. I take this opportunity of bringing particularly to notice the undue delay in submitting the reports from the Kheri district. Division and districts. Number of dispensaries in the circle. 5. The Province of Oudh comprises four divisions( 2 ) Assistant Surgeons. * Appear popular with the inhabitants and in- crease their salary by occasional fees from medical attendance. Hospital Assistants. 8. Of the higher class of medical subordinate Assistant Surgeons,* their conduct and qualifications have invariably been very well reported on with very few exceptions ; the Hospital Assistants in independent charge have given satisfaction to their superior officers ; on the whole their conduct and qualifications may be styled good. Native medical pupils. 9. In the report submitted in 1875, para. 15, page 3, Dr. Cannon remarks that after closely watching, the experiment of attaching native medical pupils to civil and regimental hospitals, with a view to their learning the rudiments of their profession before sending them to the several medical colleges is an established failure, and this is my own experience also. Much time would be saved by the lads being sent to a school to prepare themselves for an entrance examination into the Medical Department, instead of, as at present, idling their time in a regimental hospital and taking advantage of their liberty and freedom from parental control to learn bad habits. Native pupils conduct. 10. Of the 28 native medical pupils serving in this circle, only nine are reported as having made " good" progress in English, the remainder as " fair," three inattentive or lazy; and of those admitted into the service in May, 1876, three have since been dismissed for bad conduct and other causes. Medical staff subor- dinates. 11. On reference to para. 6, it will be observed that the medical staff is very large, but does not include such lads as have passed out of the Balrámpur medical school, and after undergoing a very searching examination, have been admitted into the local service as passed medical pupils for employment in Oudh alone. The number of medical subordi- nates cannot be dispensed with so long as many districts still maintain several branch dispensaries; for instance, in Bara Banki there are six, and in Kheri four. Recommendations. 12. One sadr and two branch establishments would be quite suffi- cient, provided an experienced Assistant Surgeon was placed in charge of the sadr, and a thoroughly qualified first class Hospital Assistant to each of the branch dispensaries. The work would then be more satis- factorily performed, better supervised, more experienced medical aid distributed ; and lastly, there would be a great saving to the Government by the closing of twelve branch establishments, or Rs. 3,510-4-11 an- nually. Number of dispen- saries affording in-door relief. 13. Twenty-six dispensaries at present afford in-door relief as a rule, or about 56 per cent. The remainder have each limited accommo- dation for the reception of any very sudden or serious case, where time does not admit of sending it into the sadr for treatment. Classification of dis- pensaries. 14. All the hospitals and dispensaries of the Province are divided into three classes and ranked according to the grants-in-aid allotted in each instance, agreeable to instructions laid down in the Chief Com- missioner's Digest, page 116, para. 1. Despensaries remain- ing open at the close of the year. 15. At the close of 1876 there were 18 1st, 2nd, and 3rd class in full and satisfactory working order.
( 3 ) Number of dispen- saries inspected by the Deputy Surgeon-Gene- ral. 16. These institutions are visited annually, so far as circumstances will permit, by the Deputy Surgeon-General, and Dr. Cannon visited and reported upon 14 sadr and 10 branch dispensaries during the year 1876-77, and his reports have already been submitted. Prevalence of disease. 17. It has not unfrequently happened that sudden and unexpected sickness has made its appearance in a particular district and medical aid urgently called for; in such instances it has hitherto been deemed expe- dient to employ itinerant native medical practitioners as a temporary measure, rather than burden the district with an establishment which might hereafter prove an incumbrance. The system introduced (I be- lieve) by the late Deputy Surgeon-General is still in force, and appears to meet all requirements. Dispensaries visited by the Civil Surgeon. Inspection by Civil Surgeon, Suffipur, 1. Mohan, 1. Hydergarh Nil. 18. Each sadr dispensary was, as a rule, inspected daily by the Civil Surgeon, and each branch dispensary on an average of 2.65 times throughout the year ; in the margin is given the names of those branch establishments which were visited only once by the Superintendent. Buildings. Shahganj. Conservancy. 19. The dispensary buildings with the marginally noted exceptions are all in excellent order, many having been put into thorough repair within the past year ; they are all reported as suitable, and the conservancy arrangements satisfactory. Medicines and instru- ments. Poisons. 20. The medicines and instruments are, without exception, sufficient, in good order, and carefully kept, all poisonous drugs being under lock and key in the possession of the medical officer in charge. Furniture. 21. The furniture in each establishment is suited to requirements. 22. At Sultanpur sadr dispensary there was an addition to the wards of some blankets, bedding, table, &c., at a cost voted and paid for from local funds. Forms in use. 23. The forms in use are those supplied to the Bengal Presidency in substitution of those of the North- Western Provinces, which until 187tl were kept up in the dispensaries of Oudh. Hospital for blind, lepers, &c. 24. The only stations in which there is a poor-house, or hospital for blind and lepers, are Lucknow, Rae Bareli, Fyzabad, Bahraich, and Sultanpur, but in no instance is the institution kept exclusively for one or other of the abovenamed complaints. Number of attendants. 25. The actual numbers of persons male and female, including 2,907 Europeans and Eurasians, who received medical and surgical aid during the past year, was 243,016, of whom 193,479 are recorded as cured, 17,956 as relieved, 887 died, or deaths to treated about .36 per cent., 34 incurable.* The accompanying table shows the actual recorded sickness and mortality of 1876, as com- pared with 1875 :( 4 ) Deaths from fever in Hardoi. Increase of attendance. 26. It is worthy of remark that of the number of deaths only five from fever are stated as having occurred in all the dispensaries of the " Hardoi" district, in which 3,474 cases came under treatment, or .14 per cent. to treated, but the " mortuary return" for the same period gives out of a population according to the census of 1872, 855,535, no less than 12,485 casualties from fever alone, a high death rate equal to the entire destruction (save 37) of the whole of the Radauli town. In comparison with the previous 12 months, the decrease in the attendance of patients is marked, being 309 against the corresponding months of 1875. This is attributed in a great measure to the healthi- ness of the season. 27. In Duriabad the actual attendance was less by 581 than the previous year, but the cause was owing to the unusual healthiness of the season, and in no way attributable to any want of attention or skill of the Hospital Assistant in charge. Cause of decrease in patients at the branch dispensary. Removal of Hospital Assistants. 28. In the report for 1875, submitted with this office No. 762, dated 28th April, 1876, and at para. 211, page 49, the branch dispen- sary at Ikowna was unfavourably commented upon, and the accuracy of the registers questioned, in consequence of which the Hospital Assis- tant in charge, 3rd class Hospital Assistant Jan Muhammad, was removed and succeeded by 3rd class Hospital Assistant Lutf Ali ; such change being deemed advisable ; the result was as might have been expected a great falling off of patients actually in attendance, or tending to prove that the previous records were falsely drawn up. The decrease in the average daily sick is in no way attributable to inattention on the part of the Hospital Assistant at present in charge, who is both popular and well reported of by his superior. Prevalent diseases. 29. The principal causes of sickness throughout the province were skin disease, 7,619 ; fevers, 6,636 ; abdominal affections, 5,650 ; in many instances particular diseases being peculiarly local; thus for instance, goitre is most prevalent in the districts of Bahraich, Fyzabad, and Gonda, as many as 7,392 cases having come under treatment during the year 1876 in Bahraich alone. Calculi in the bladder is very frequently met with in the districts of Fyzabad and Gonda. Fevers of a bad type being most common in the districts bordering on the Oudh tarái. 30. The most fatal diseases which came under treatment and the localities ranking according to frequency were : ( 5 ) * This evidently in- cludes fractures and dis- locations. 33. The Hardoi sadr dispensary takes rank first in the number of capital operations performed, and the following suc- ceed in order of merit :( 6 ) 39. The accounts of the Balrampur Hospital, as will appear from statement No. 1, show that its finances are in a flourishing condition, the annual expenditure being well within the income, and leaving a large balance at the close of the year. 40. The actual amount of subscriptions having increased by Rs. 2,867-12-4 over the previous year, and the Government allowance has increased by Rs. 3,003-12-0 during the same period. The total receipts during the past 12 months were Rs. 46,l60-5-10, and with the balance at credit on the 31st December, 1875, Rs. 69.999-7-12. The aggregate amount of Government grants was Rs. 30,883-11-7 ; the expenditure during the period under review was Rs. 79, 102-4-10, including the sums spent in the various institutions in repairs, leaving a balance in hand on the 1st January, 1877, of Rs. 21,780-14-9; but although this sum appears large, it is very unequally divided ; for instance, in the civil dispen- sary, Lucknow, the amount available on the 1st January, 1877, was Rs. 2,288-0-8. In Unao district the year closes with a balance of Rs, 686-11-5, and not a rupee in favour of any of the branch institutions. So too in Bara Banki Rs. 132-10-5 were available on the 31st December, 1876, but all the branch establishments, as in most other districts, open accounts afresh with nothing in hand. In Sitapur, the sadr dispensaries each have a small balance to their credit, whilst the receipts and disbursements of the branch institutions as most of the others in the province balance each other. Rs a. p. Shahganj 182 0 10 Tanda 286 14 11 Akbarpur 360 15 0 41. In the Fyzabad division the sadr and its three branch dis- pensaries, as per margin, as also the three branch establishments in the Bahraich district and Rae Bareli and its two branch dispensaries had each a fair open- ing balance on the 1st January, 1877 ; but the Gonda sadr dispensary is out of all proportion, and has a larger balance than any other dispen- sary in the province, there being Rs 3,000 in hand at the close of the year, but in the three branch dispensaries in this district the expenditure is balanced by receipts. 42. Out of the 34 branch dispensaries in Oudh, only Rs. 3,034-3-0 was in deposit to credit in eight branch establishments in January 1877, and which, if equally distributed, would give about Rs, 88 to each of the 34 alluded to. 43. In the civil dispensary at Lucknow the Government grant was Rs. 1,133-11-10, and from other sources Rs, 1,074, leaving with the amount to credit on the 31st December, 1875, a balance in hand of Rs. 2,288-0-8, after all expenses had been defrayed. King's hospital 44. The expenditure and receipts shown in Statement No. 1 gives only the sums actually drawn and paid away, but the income does not appear, the institution being supported by the monies from Government securities, and the sums already at the credit of the endowment. Dieting patients. 45. The total cost of dieting patients was Rs. 5,521-0-8, or about 8.43 pie per head per diem. The amount expended during the past year in the purchase of medicines was( 7 ) for quinine in the treatment of fevers generally, a great saving will accrue, the former being procurable at Rs. 16-8-0 per lb., and quinine Rs. 100 to 120 per. lb. 46. There is a note to the effect that the receipts shown at the Sitapur dispensary as Rs. 995-14-0 is actually Rs. l,l93-3-4, as there are no subscriptions, especially for the Mahmudabad branch dispensary, beyond the Government contributions. Rs. 197-5-4 out of the above sum has been transferred to the branch institution, and appears under the head of " receipts from other sources." 17. In the Nanpara branch dispensary the sum of Rs. 73-5-9, shown as balance in No. 1 statement of the last year's report, is a deficit and not balance, and the item alluded to is included in the expenditure of 1876. In the Jais branch dispensary the expenditure in 1875 was apparently incorrectly given as Rs. 244-5-11, but it should have been Rs.213-7-11, hence the balance became Rs. 466-7-2 instead of Rs. 497-5-2, which is correct. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant. S. C. AMESBURY, M.D., Surgeon-Major, 6th B. L. I.
