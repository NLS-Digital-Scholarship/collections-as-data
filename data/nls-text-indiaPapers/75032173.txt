Further, as no consideration of the urine in itself could be looked on as a statement of the whole case, without, at the same time, a review of the condition of the blood from which the urine is derived, it will be necessary to make some attempt to examine the modifications met with in the constituents of the blood in natives of Bengal. The modifications of the blood and urine found during these investigations naturally led to the question of the causation of the changes; a series of inves- tigations, therefore, was carried out3 day only had been examined.

5 We have now over two hundred analyses of the urine of students and others, all of whom had a free choice of food; it will be our first duty to attempt to lay down, as accurately as possible from the number of observations at our disposal, standards for at least the more important constituents and to compare them with the standards generally accepted for Europeans in a colder climate. For this purpose it will be sufficient to strike an average for the total number of analyses without taking any note of the particular caste of the subject from whom the urine was obtained. 1.Quantity of urine excreted in the twenty-four hours.6 of one student and one durwan. These limits practically cover the variations seen in the daily analyses also. The average specific gravity over the whole series works out to about 1013, being slightly higher than this for the students alone, viz., 1015. We therefore find that, although a much larger proportion of the fluids got rid of from the body goes by the skin in tropical climates than in Europe, still the excretion of the total solids as measured by the specific gravity7 Since, however, some of the nitrogen of proteids is eliminated in forms other than urea8 sweat, milk, hairs, epithelial scales, intestinal secretions, etc., is so small that it may be neglected. As nitrogen forms on an average about 16 per cent. of the proteid molecule, we are able to calculate from an estimation of the total nitrogen the amount of proteid material broken down in the body, one gramme of nitrogen in the urine requiring the katabolism of 6.25 grammes of proteid. Further, since the human system is ever striving after a condition of nitrogen- ous equilibrium9 The minimum average for durwans will be seen to be 2.61 grammes ; the maximum 9.30 grammes; the average amount of nitrogen eliminated on 36 daily analyses being 5.94 grammes. In the case of bearers, domes and mehtars similar figures were obtained, the average on 40 daily observations being 5.96 grammes. The average of nitrogen excretion over the whole series of 200 analyses comes to the small amount 5.98 grammes daily. This very small total nitrogen excretion in the urine of the Bengali is in marked contrast to the 15 to 18 grammes excreted by Europeans and, from a scientific point of view, forms one of the features of the results. It means the metabolism of only about 37.50 grammes of proteid daily by the Bengali10 5. The freezing-point of the urine.11 This is the more remarkable when the almost entirely vegetable nature of the diet is considered. Bunge (1)has called attention to the fact that among men and animals the craving for salt is limited, for the most part at least, to those living on vegetable food. On a purely animal diet there is no desire for salt. Bunge explains this phenomenon in the following manner. Most vegetable foods contain a large quantity of potassium and these salts on absorption react in the blood with sodium chloride, giving rise to potassium chloride and potassium sulphate; both these salts are removed at once by the kidneys since they are both practically foreign to the blood; so that the blood in this way loses some of its sodium chloride; hence the craving for more salt with vegetable food. We were therefore prepared to find a high average in the salt excretion of the Bengali as he had a free choice in the quantity of salt taken with his vege- table food. But such is not the case; the quantity got rid of by the kidneys is actually lower than in Europeans. These results are in striking contrast to those shown in Table XIII, where the intake and output of salt is very excessive. This, however, is a subject to which we shall return when dealing with the metabolism of the Bengali. The quotient 12 (b) The kreatinin nitrogen13 Table II14. total elimination of sulphates compared with Europeans. The average works out at 1.88 grammes. The combined sulphuric acid occurring in the urine as aromatic products15 methods of blood examination have been made use of, and newer methods employed and modified to push the examination as far as possible in order to obtain a knowledge of any departure from European standards. The result of the urine analyses has been shown to be that the percentage or total quantity of the constituents excreted was on a very much lower scale than is the case in Europeans; the blood being the source from which the urine is derived, we should expect to find some modification in its chemical compo- sition and formed elements. Let us examine the evidence at our disposal. 1. The corpuscular enumeration and hæmoglobin value.16 (a) The average number of red blood corpuscles per c.m. of blood in the Bengali is greater than in Europeans. In over 80 per cent. of those examined this average works out to be 5,300,000 per c.m. In European healthy adult males the average number of red blood corpuscles was 5,190,000 per c.m. over 113 observations.(1) (b) The white blood cells are, on the average, slightly more numerous than in Europeans. On 156 observations the average number is 9000 per c.m. (c) The hæmoglobin estimation (Haldane's modification of Gower's method17 1518 The principle of the method is to find the particular dilution of a nor- mal solution of sodium chloride, two volumes of which will exactly cause hæmolysis of one volume of the blood. Let this dilution be N/45; this is equivalent to a 0.130 per cent. solution NaCl. Now, in a similar way the dilution of the serum with distilled water necessary in order that two volumes of the diluted serum may cause hæmolysis of one volume of blood is found. Therefore we have for example:19 We have found it better to use as large an amount of serum as possible so long as the serum is clear; the error of observation is thus reduced to a minimum. The average amount of chlorides present in the serum of the Bengali over a large series of investigations by this method works out at from .7020 Table VII.

In the Bengali the clotting of the blood is very much quicker than in the European. The average time of coagulation obtained in our series is from 1¾24 climate do not exhibit, even in the hot, moist atmosphere of Calcutta, such a low average blood pressure as is seen in the Bengali. As would be expected, the vasomotor system becomes more or less accustomed to the new conditions and regains its function of maintaining the tonicity of the vessels in the area of peripheral resistance; this in its turn is one of the principal factors in the maintenance of blood-pressure. In the consideration of this question the force and frequency of the heart-beat is a factor that cannot be neglected. In the second part of this paper we shall have evidence to bring forward regarding the physical development of the Bengali and his power of muscular exertion which will tend to show that the capacity for muscular work is decidedly superior in the European. From a similar line of argument we hold that the same causes that effect the superiority of the European's ordinary voluntary muscles also maintain the muscular tissue of the heart in a higher state of nutrition and permit of the superior force and vigour of its contraction. Whatever the cause or causes may be, the pressure of the blood in the arteries of Bengalis is from 15 per cent. to 22 per cent. lower than in Europeans. It is worth recalling in connection with this that the percentage of hæmoglobin is also only about 75 per cent. to 80 per cent. of the European standard. To a consideration of this subject we shall return later; at present, we may close our investigations on the blood of the Bengali by collecting the results in the form of a table comparing them with normal European standards.

In the first part of this paper we have shown from the analyses of the urine of a large number of different individuals comprising several classes that the total amount of proteid metabolised on the average by the Bengali is only 37.50 grammes per day and that, therefore, only a slightly greater quantity than this of assimilable proteid is absorbed from their ordinary diet. On the other hand, according to Carl Voit, who is held in the very highest estimation as a student of nutrition, an adult man of average body- weight (7026 on the excretion of nitrogen. On the other hand, increased muscular exertion does entail a marked increase in the consumption of oxygen and in the excretion of carbon dioxide. Non-nitrogenous matter had, therefore, to be considered as a source or as the main source of the energy of muscular contraction. To-day an hypothesis(1)almost diametrically the opposite of the theories of Liebig and Pflüger is held in much favour. According to this view the nitrogen of the proteid food-stuffs is rapidly eliminated from the products of digestion, and excreted in the form of urea, whilst the carbohydrate moiety of the proteid molecule forms, on oxidation, the main source of the energy- supply of the organism. The tissues themselves undergo degradation under exceptional circumstances only, as, for example, when the supply of food is insufficient to produce the energy required by the body. According to those who hold this view, as the main source of energy is the oxidation of the non- nitrogenous part of the proteid molecule,(2) nitrogenous food should play a com- paratively subordinate role in the general economy of nutrition, and its function as a source of energy should be capable of being entirely replaced by carbohy- drates and fats. The researches of Chittenden, Siven and others have all been directed to the establishment of this conception; Chittenden's, works in particular being an earnest plea for moderation in the proteid intake. This view clearly recognises the all-importance of nitrogenous food in the nutrition of the body. It is the only source of nitrogen available in the system and the only source from which the proteid-containing tissues of the body can be maintained. It is, there- fore, obvious that "there must be a certain amount of true proteid tissue broken down each day, independent of that larger metabolism coincident with the intake of proteid food." We have therefore to distinguish between two forms of metabolism27 Folin therefore concludes that metabolism may be considered under two heads, viz.:28 still greater advantage ? We submit that the evidence obtained from a study of metabolism of the Bengali has a distinct bearing on the answers to these questions and throws a certain amount of light on the correctness or otherwise of the different opinions put forward. It will be at once apparent that the amount of proteid metabolised by the Bengali29 a sufficiently large number of individuals to eliminate the error due to any one subject falling much below the ordinary standard. It is, therefore, obvious that, so far as our analyses go, they bear out, in every detail, all that Chittenden has contended for, viz. :30 From the statistics at our disposal, collected from many different sources, the average weight of the healthy adult male European is about 70 kilos. Quetelet's(1) tables, however, give, a somewhat lower average, viz., about 66 kilos. Taking the mean of these figures there is a difference of from 22 to 30 per cent. in favour of the European. In other words, we may say that the average Bengali weighs about 25 per cent. less than the average European. How does this fact modify the food requirements of the Bengali ? Von Noorden states31 means a lowering of the moral standard of recruits(1). With a low standard of physical development we are apt to get recruits not only small, but unsteady, wanting in mental ballast as well as in physical strength. (b) The Height.32 Another common rule is "normally developed individuals weigh as many kilos. as their length measures in centimètres after subtracting the first metre'' (Landois). This works, out very accurately for the average height and weight of Europeans33 From the evidence of differences in the chemical composition of the blood enumerated above it may be fairly deduced that the diet34 muscular development and to the lower condition of vitality that must follow from the presence of a composition of the blood exhibiting the lower physiological limits of such necessary constituents as hæmoglobin and floating proteids of the plasma combined with a lower scale of arterial pressure. All these factors react not only on the muscular tissues but affect every tissue of the body, and particularly the delicate mechanism of the central nervous system. Mosso's work has taught us that fatigue has much more to do with changes in the central nervous system than with mere fatigue of muscle-substance due either to accumulation of waste-products or consumption of the reserve of energy-producing material. It would, therefore, appear that in a condition in which the metabolic chemical changes of the central nervous system are kept continually on a low level35 Table X36 accidental circumstances the investigations had to be dropped after the fourth day; but, as the results are of importance regarding the minimal proteid intake necessary for nitrogenous equilibrium, we reproduce them in Table XI. This table is of interest from another point of view as, we believe, it is the first time a nitrogen balance sheet has been worked out in India:37 means the daily metabolism of only 0.681 grm. per kilo. of body-weight38 per cent. of the total proteid intake re-appeared in the stools, never having been assimilated and therefore can only be looked on as so much waste. The diet of No. 2 also largely consisted of rice and dhall. The second set of investigations was carried out on prisoners. In order to facilitate the work and to obtain some idea of the constitution and nature of the different scales of diet laid down for prisoners a table was prepared showing the quantities of the several proximate principles of the diets in grammes. This is reproduced in Table XII. As will be at once evident, these diet scales are exceedingly liberal com- pared with those we have discussed so far. The proteid element in some instances almost reaches Voit's standard and is far superior in quantity to the proteid element in the average diet of the great majority of the population of the province.

Specific Gravity. Urea in nitrogen. Nitrogen in fæces. Freezing- point44 Table XIII45 Practically speaking the diet is vegetable in character, only 2.48 or at most 2.69 grammes proteid coming from flesh in the form of fish. More than half the proteid is provided in the form of rice and the great majority of the remain- der in the form of dhall. It will be evident from the results we obtained in the case of students, servants and assistants that this amount of proteid is quite sufficient to maintain the body in a condition of nitrogenous equilibrium. Whether maintenance of nitro- genous equilibrium on a low proteid intake and maintenance of the body in an ideal condition of health and vigour are identical as Chittenden's statements would tend to lead us to believe, is an open question and one on which we have been able to bring a certain amount of evidence to bear. From a quantitative proteid intake standpoint the diet may be said to have little interest; but it is very different when we come to examine its real value, i.e., the amount of proteid absorbable and of actual service in the system. In order to show the principal points of importance in connection with the fate of the nitrogen of the food we have drawn up Table XIV. This table covers the same period as Table XIII and is derived from it. Table XIV. Individual. Total nitrogen intake in grms. Total fæcal nitrogen in grms. Total nitrogen assimilated in grms.

Compared with Chit- tenden's statement of the quantity he considers necessary, or our own figures obtained from a study of Bengali students and others, this is a very liberal allow- ance. On the other hand, when we examine the columns in Table XIV showing the percentage of the absorbable to the non-absorbable, it is evident that the diet is an inferior one. Over the series of analyses recorded no less than 25.52 per cent. of the proteid of the food passes out unchanged. This result is in marked contrast to what Chittenden obtained in different experiments on students, scientific men and soldiers; in all his records the fæcal nitrogen was exceedingly small in amount. To this he attaches the greatest importance and, in fact, makes it one of the principal arguments in favour of strict modera tion of proteid intake, contending that with a small nitrogenous residue the opportunity afforded for intestinal putrefaction and fæcal intoxication is kept at a minimum. If this view is sound and worthy of credence, and we believe it to be so, what can be said about the diets presented and discussed above ? They are one and all bad in every respect, and particularly bad in that the large waste in the alimentary canal allows excessive micro-organismal development and for- mation of toxic compounds. As we already have had occasion to point out, this must assuredly be a factor in the prevalence of intestinal disorders and in the causation of certain diseases. So much is this the case that an experienced Jail officer states that it is one of the rarest of novelties to discover a prisoner who passes a solid stool. From an economical standpoint alone the large waste in food material is worthy of consideration and investigation. What part of the diet is princi- pally to blame? We have made some investigations and collected evidence that would appear to inculpate the dhall; they are not sufficient, however, to base a definite opinion on. It is well known that, even among those accustomed to dhall and of course much more so with Europeans, if a small amount of dhall more than usual be partaken of, diarrh47 The last point to which we wish to refer is the salt elimination of the urine in the form of chlorides. The actual amount of salt added to the food of these men was up to, in most instances, 28 grammes daily; this was in addition to the salt already present in the composition of the different food materials. From a glance at Table XIII it is apparent that large quantities of chlorides were eliminated in the urine. On the average, for the daily analyses shown, the excretion of chlorides comes to 32.30 grammes. We have already discussed at some length the evidence for an increased physiological demand for sodium chloride when the diet is largely vegetable, and we have shown that excessive quantities of salt are not generally made use of by the Bengali. The reason of this is that rice forms the great bulk of the food of the Bengali and rice contains comparatively little potassium salts; so that, accepting Bunge's explanation that the increased demand for salt with a vegetable diet depends on the effects of the contained potassium salts causing an increased elimination of sodium and chlorine in the urine, there is no urgent reason with diets of the above type for a large addition of salt. Physiologically the presence of from 4 to 6 grammes of salt in the daily diet is sufficient protection against a loss of chlorine from the blood and tissues. With a purely vegetable diet, as in the case of our figures for students, etc., we found the average amount excreted daily was under 10 grammes. With regard to these four prisoners the excretion was more than three times as great as in other Bengalis, and, as will be evident, it corresponded very closely with the intake. What is the effect of this excessive ingestion of salt ? Straub states when the salt intake reaches 0.6 to 1.1 gramme per kilo of body-weight diuresis and augmented nitrogenous metabolism sets in. In the prisoners under observation Straub's lower limit was exceeded, and, as will be apparent from the column of Table XIII giving the quantity of urine excreted, diuresis was a marked feature in every instance where the salt intake was high. This is in accordance with what would be expected and with common experience. Salt taken in excess must either be eliminated or retained within the system; whether eliminated or retained water must be imbibed in sufficient quantity to form an isotonic solution. If the kidneys are normal this excess of salt and water is quickly got rid of in the urine; but, as the kidneys are only able to excrete a dilute saline solution, large quantities of water are necessary in order to eliminate the excess of salt48 there will be at once a large increase in the amount of salt eliminated in the urine; but the output will not be quite equal to the increased intake, so that some has been retained. With this retention there must be also a retention of fluids to keep the salt in solution; in this way there will be an increase in the body-weight in proportion to the degree of salt retention. Later as the system becomes accustomed to the larger salt intake it attains, as it were, a higher level of salt metabolism, all excess of salt above this level being got rid of so that salt equilibrium again becomes established. We may conclude that there is no justification for the employment of such excessive amounts of salt in the diets of prisoners. Its effects are to increase the work thrown on the kidneys, to increase the salt concentration of the blood and tissues rendering the latter more or less water-logged and to cause thirst and diuresis. In addition there will be a fictitious advance in body-weight due to the retention of fluids by the tissues. V.49 The diet is very much more varied and appetising than is sanctioned for prisoners. The gross amounts of the different constituents are less in quantity50 Table XVI. Place of observations. Num- ber. Average weight kilos. Daily proteid metabolism (excluding nitrogen of fæces). Nitrogen per kilo of body-weight grm. Duration. A51 admittedly sufficient52 explain the discrepancy above noted as the larger proportion of those of the students who lost weight were below 18 years of age and were therefore in need of a higher protein intake than provided in the diet. The individuals on whom Chittenden experimented were, on the other hand, all fully matured adults with their total mass of proteid-containing tissues already formed, so that retention on that account was unnecessary; nitrogenous equilibrium could therefore be established on a comparatively lower proteid intake. It is quite possible that in the construction of tissue proteid certain groups of molecules are needed and, in order to obtain these, there must seemingly be a wasteful use of proteid food, hence the demand for a large nitrogenous intake during early life. Further, in connection with this subject, facts are beginning to accumulate pointing to the specific nature of the proteid counting for something in nutrition. Chittenden states with regard to the experiments on feeding of dogs: "It is somewhat impressive to note how well dogs thrive on a relatively large amount of vegetable food, provided there is a modicum of animal food added thereto. In other words, these high proteid-consumers are apparently quite able to utilise the vegetable foods, but there is something lacking in such a diet which the body has need of." The grouping of the atoms in the proteid molecule is different when the proteid comes from the animal or from the vegetable kingdom. They yield different decomposition-products or the same products in different proportions so that in absorption and assimilation of the proteid food-stuffs the body has to deal with the various chemical elements. There is thus a distinct possibility, even a probability, that in the vegetable diet of the Bengali certain cleavage products are lacking or only formed in very small proportion, the result of which is that physical development is retarded and, in most instances, the muscular tissues are exceedingly meagre and thin. To quote Chittenden(1) again: "If we suppose that in the formation of true tissue proteid or the living protoplasm of the cell, certain of these end- products of proteid decomposition are absolutely indispensable, we can easily picture to ourselves a dearth of such building stones in the long continued use of a diet which lacks that particular proteid from which the necessary building stones can be split off in adequate numbers." The conception in this quota- tion may be applied equally truly to the replacement of old worn-out stones and to the ordinary processes of endogenous or tissue metabolism as to the building up of new tissue proteid. As an example of a still more inferior type of diet we produce the value in proximate principles of the food-stuffs laid down for students of another college in Bengal. From enquiries we believe the students provide themselves with extra materials53 It will be evident that a diet of this type is absolutely inadequate in prac- tically every detail. The amount of absorbable proteid is below what is neces- sary to maintain nitrogenous equilibrium and the heat value of the diet is very deficient. Table XVII. Proximate Prin- ciples. Rice. Dhall.

VI.54 hitherto been able to accumulate would certainly point to the fact that with a diet poorer in nitrogen55 or a too liberal allowance of provisions, a large amount remaining uneaten. From enquiries we were given to understand that the rice and dhall often remained over but that the remaining portions are always consumed. It must be remembered, however, that the students we are dealing with are all between the ages of 16 to 20 years56 Reference to Table XVI will show that this is a very much larger proteid meta- bolism than found in any of the different classes of Bengalis investigated, the prisoner of the Bengal Jails being the only case approaching it in quantity. The influence of diet we consider is abundantly obvious in a comparison of these Anglo-Indian and Eurasian boys and the 568 Bengali students already analysed. The two classes enter College about the same age, live in the same climate and under very similar conditions; further, as we have pointed-out, there is no racial reason why the Bengali should not grow out to be every bit as well developed as the other class; but the results at the end of their College career are very different. The Anglo-Indian and Eurasian boys develop into strong, healthy men quite up to the average of European standards, while the Bengali students almost remain stationary as regards development57 That is, compared with a maximum increase in body-weight of 2 lbs. in the case of the Bengali students, we find an increase of 14 lbs. in Anglo-Indian and Eurasian students over a similar period. (2) In a comparison of weight on entrance and weight in the third year only 2 per cent. show a diminution compared with 42.8 per cent. in the Bengali; practically 100 per cent. gained weight continu- ously during the three years58 investigation and by the general tendency of the evidence we have been able to bring forward. It will be sufficient to put these facts in a concise form; this we have attempted to do in Table XXI. Table XXI. Class investigated. No. Nitrogen per kilo. Duration. PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT.

The interpretation of this table is obvious and need not detain us. Taken in connection with Table XV we get a very fair idea of the results attained by Chittenden and of those attained by ourselves in Bengalis and Anglo-Indians. We consider that the figures set forth in these tables prove conclusively that, with a diet poor in nitrogen, individuals are produced who are deficient in muscle, poorly supplied with blood and who exhibit defective development. With a liberal scale of proteid intake results the opposite of these are the rule. It would further appear from the results of computation of physical develop- ment59 Dr. Shrusball60 England. India. Weekly outturn of cloth per operative 767 yds. 240 yds. Average approximate counts 40 s. 20 s. Working hours per week 55½ 80 Working hours per year 2,775 4,120 Monthly wages per spinning operative Rs. 70 Rs.13 Monthly wages per weaving operative Rs. 72 Rs.15 Neither wages alone nor hours alone can form a basis for comparing British and Indian labour costs. Indian labour is lacking in continuous application, punctuality, energy and regularity. Men have often to be employed in India for work that women will do in England. The Indian workers have little skill or education and consequently they make much waste; their sense of discipline is imperfect; their attendance irregular; and they take long intervals for rest, smoking, etc. (Commercial Supplement of the Times.) (c) In the coal mines of Europe and Bengal we have perhaps the best comparative test of the capabilities of the different classes of workmen. It must be remembered, however, that in the United Kingdom coal is mined at ten times the depth of the average depth of mines in Bengal; the great majority of Bengal mines being worked by inclines of only a few hundred feet in depth. The relation between the number of hands employed and the output of the collieries varies considerably in different districts, being highest in those where the coal is moderately thick, soft, easily cut and with a good roof, and least in faulted and disturbed seams and those with a bad roof where the accessory operations of timbering and driving stone drifts requires the employment of a large number of the working staff on non-productive work, i. e., other than cutting coal. The following figures give the relative force employed above and below ground in two large steam collieries in South Wales each producing about 500 tons per day:61 For the last year for which statistics are available62 Many other instances of the inferior capabilities of the native workman might be given, but we have said enough to support our contention that, physical development depending largely on diet and environment, the vegetable-eating Bengali on a diet poor in nitrogen is incapable of performing the same amount of work63 (3) The power of resistance to disease. Chittenden states "the smallest amount of food that will serve to maintain bodily and mental vigour, keep up bodily strength and preserve the normal powers of resistance to disease, is an ideal diet. Any excess over and above what is really needed for these purposes imposes just so much of an unnecessary strain upon the organism. It imposes on the excretory organs the needless labour of removing waste products which could well be dispensed with64 necessary nutritive exchanges are deficient and the cells suffer. We can quite- easily imagine a condition of the blood it which this malnutrition of the renal epithelium obtains with even a full free flow of blood through its vessels. Such is met with in the extreme forms of anæmia due to ankylostomiasis so prevalent in this province. As has been shown already(1) a similar condition of "renal impermeability" to chlorides, as seen in ordinary nephritis, was found to be present in ankylostomiasis, and the recent report of the Porto Rico Commission would prove conclusively that albuminuria is a very common feature of this infection. Further, the Commission emphasizes the fact that the accompanying albuminuria with casts should be regarded as the evidence of a degenerative process in the kidney, not as an inflammation or, more specifically, nephritis. We have, therefore, in the anæmia of ankylostomiasis a degenera- tion of the epithelial cells and impairment of function due to an impoverished condition of the blood. That the total solids and nutritive materials of the blood are very deficient in ankylostomiasis we have satisfactory analyses to prove. In certain cases we have found the dry residue decreased well over 50 per cent. Exact information is wanting regarding the degree of impoverishment of the blood plasma the kidney epithelial cells are capable of withstanding before degenerative changes begin to occur. We do know, however, that on a liberal proteid intake the blood contains about 20 per cent. of proteid and, on a diet containing 50 per cent. less proteid, it can and has been proved that there is a considerable fall in the total solids and in the floating proteids of the plasma65 the Medical College Hospital, Calcutta; St. Thomas' and St. Bartholomew's, London, with the following result:66 passed over in a sentence the carbohydrates and fats of the several diets. This was not because they are of little importance, but for the simple reason that in all the diets we have examined these elements were sufficient in amount and, as far as could be seen, called for little comment. Great importance has been attached by Chittenden to the evil effects of a diet too rich in nitrogen and with him our observations on Bengalis and others would lead us to go a certain length; but, from the arguments advanced in the previous pages, we would draw the line much before a decrease of 50 per cent. in the proteid of Voit's diet had been reached. Even if one grants that in the normal decomposition of proteids toxic bodies are formed which, while in the body or during their excretion, may act injuri- ously, it is by no means certain that decomposition products also toxic in nature are not formed from the carbohydrate and fat of the diet. In connection with this, the extreme prevalence of glycosuria amongst the upper middle classes of Bengalis would prove conclusively that the danger of an excess of carbohydrate intake is even a more real and present one than that of proteid excess. Glycosuria, either with or without albuminuria, is one of the commonest diseases met with in the class above-mentioned and is a very frequent cause of death. After the age from 45 to 50 years a very large percentage of these indi- viduals suffer from one or other of these conditions. It usually begins as a simple dietetic form due to the large quantities of starchy food and sweetmeats consumed, but, after a longer or shorter period, develops into true diabetes, impairment of kidney function and accompanied with the usual complications of both the primary and secondary diseases. We have already stated the views we hold regarding the danger of damage to the renal epithelium from a low nutritive power of the plasma; in the form of glycosuria we speak of it would appear probable that the plasma is quite unable to prevent epithelial degeneration and albuminuria. In a series of 325 cases of glycosuria Dr. Bose(1) found that 65 per cent showed evidence of kidney damage. Whether the damage to the kidney is due entirely to the continual elimina- tion of sugar and changes in the composition of the blood from the formation of decomposition products of faulty carbohydrate metabolism such as 67 We are greatly inclined to think that the explanation of these differences rests largely with the nutritive power of the plasma in the two classes of people; the poor nitrogen content of the plasma in the Bengali starving the renal cells and causing them to lose their physiological property of preventing a filtration of the serum albumen of the blood into the tubules. The disturbances of the organism we more particularly wish to emphasize in dietetic glycosuria are the lowering of the resisting power of the tissues to microbic invasion and lessening of their vitality. The common complications of diabetes, pneumonia, tuberculosis, carbuncle, spreading gangrene, etc., all speak of lowered vitality and increased susceptibility. Before complications such as these appear there must be a time when, although in a lowered state of vitality, the tissues are just able to resist infection. It is generally held that the percen- tage of sugar in the blood should reach from 0.2 to 0.3 before glycosuria occurs, but long before this ratio is attained degenerative changes, the result of lowered vitality, have begun. It would, therefore, appear that the large carbohydrate intake rendered necessary by a diet poor in nitrogen, and of course much more so the great quantities of sugar consumed by the Bengali, is even more likely to lead to injury and damage to the delicate tissues of glandular and other organs and to a diminution in the resisting power of the system than any excessive nitrogenous intake.
