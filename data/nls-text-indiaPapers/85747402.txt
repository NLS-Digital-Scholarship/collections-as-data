A Statistics relating to the number of children under one year of age in towns available for vaccination, and the number of successful operations performed on them during the year 1904-05 ixProceedings of His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab in the Home (Medicial and Sanitary) Department, No. 1610 S , dated 5th August 1905. READ3 The actual cost to local bodies is about one anna ten pies for the work done by the district staffs. The numbers of the inspecting staff would now seem to be adequate. Out of 693,804 cases of vaccination in the various districts (excluding Kángra), 670,765 were inspected by various members of the staff. The average pay of the vaccinating staff as shown in Statement II would appear to be about Rs. 11 per mensem, while that of the district clerks is Rs. 38 per mensem. It is noted that 16 peons are entertained in the Lahore District, whereas the average in other districts is one only. The number seems excessive, and requires some explanation. 5. The returns of vaccinations in Municipalities in which the Act is in force show that about 73 per cent. of the ' available ' children under one year of age were vaccinated. The figures in some of the larger towns are disappointing'as for instance in Multán, Delhi and Dera Gházi Khan. The Officiating Lieutenant- Governor agrees with the Sanitary Commissioner that the Act where introduced should be strictly enforced. At the same time it may be noted that the Municipal towns continued remarkably free from small-pox during the year, the total number of deaths in 146 towns amounting to 1,837 only, or a percentage of 0.48 per mille of population. 6. With regard to the remarks contained in paragraph 4 of Government of India letter No. 63, dated 8th January 1900, and paragraph 4 of Government of India letter No. 2483, dated 1st December 1902, regarding the use of glycerinated vaccine, the Officiating Lieutenant-Governor is glad to note that the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Captain W. F. Harvey, has now succeeded in producing glycerinated lymph of a reliable quality. An additional grant has been made in order to extend the Animal Lymph Depôt at Lahore, and it is hoped to supply the entire requirements of at least three districts with this lymph during the coming year. 7. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner inspected a considerable number of vaccinations during the year, and in some districts a large number were also inspected by Civil Surgeons. The number of inspections made by the Civil Surgeons of Ambála, Montgomery, Amritsar, Gurdáspur, Rawalpindi, Dera Gházi Khan and Jhang were, however, insufficient. Lieutenant-Colonel Bamber remained in charge of the Department during the year, and the Officiating Lieutenant-Governor desires to acknowledge the efficient conduct of its opera- tions throughout the period under review.

No. 1742½. FROM LIEUTENANT-COLONEL C. J. BAMBER, I.M.S., Sanitary Commissioner, Punjab, To W. M. HAILEY, ESQUIRE, C. S., Offg. Judicial and General Secretary to Government, Punjab. Dated LAHORE, the 1st July 1905. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit, for the information of His Honour the Officiating Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab, the Annual Vaccination Returns for the year 1904-05. In my Notes for 1902-03 and 1903-04 I made brief remarks on the most important points in the returns for those years. In the present Report I will deal more fully with the work performed during the trien- nial period ending 1904-05. Administration. 2. I held charge of the Vaccination Department throughout the year. Captain W. F. Harvey, I.M.S., carried on the duties of Deputy Sanitary Commissioner from 1st to 11th April 1904 and from 2nd October 1904 to 31st March 1905. For the intervening period, from 12th April to 30th June 1904, he worked as Assistant Director of the Pasteur Institute at Kasauli, and from 8th July to 1st October 1904 he was on privilege leave. During his absence, Captain W. H. C. Forster, I.M.S., acted for him. Establishment. State- ment No. II. 3. There was no material change in the strength of the vaccination staff. The average number of vaccinators employed in the Prov- ince in 1904-05 was two hundred and sixty-one, being one more than in the previous year and two less than in 1902-03. The number of Superintendents of Vaccination was twenty-seven in 1902-03. In 1903-04 and 1904-05 two more men were appointed for the newly constituted districts of Miánwáli and Attock. There were three Divisional Inspectors of Vaccina- tion and Registration of Births and Deaths in 1902-03, one each for the Divisions of Delhi, Jullundur and Rawalpindi. In November 1903 the appointments of Divisional Inspectors for the Lahore and Multán Divisions were also sanctioned, so that in 1904-05 each of the five Divisions of the Prov- ince had its own Inspector. Cost of the Department. Statement No. II. 4. The total expenditure of the Vaccination Department, as shown in Statement No. II, was Rs. 92,688. This amount does not include the cost of the vaccination staff of the Kángra district from which no returns were received owing to the recent earthquake. If the figures for this district are excluded from the returns of the previous two years, the total expenditure for 1904-05 would show an increase of Rs. 3,686 and Rs. 2,120, respectively, as compared with 1903-04 and 1902-03, chiefly under the following heads : (1) Pay of Divisional Inspectors and (2) Contingencies. Average cost per success- ful case. Statement No.II. 5. The average cost of each successful operation was two annas and four pies, or exactly the same as in the previous year, and two pies less than in 1902-03. Total operations by all establishments. Statement No. I. 6. In 1901-02, when plague broke out for the first time in a severe epidemic form in the Province, vaccination operations were suspended in certain badly infected tracts owing to the people being in a disturbed state of mind, and this caused a considerable falling off in the total amount of work for that year; but, as it was feared that plague might recur year by year, I pointed out the advisability of leaving, in future, no infected area unprotected against small-pox. The Punjab Government, accepting my suggestion, ordered vaccination to be
2 carried on, as usual, in the infected places, and it is gratifying to observe that there has been a steady increase in the work during the last two years, as will be seen from the following figures:3 all Civil Surgeons last year, before the commencement of the vaccinating season, asking them to direct the vaccination staff to re-vaccinate one-eighth part of a district every year, so that the whole of it might be finished in the course of seven or eight years. This order, I am glad to find, has been carried out with marked success in many of the districts, as will be seen from the large number of re-vaccinations performed during the year 1904-05. There are, however, a few districts in which the work was most unsatisfactory, as, for instance, Rohtak and Gurgáon, in which practically little or nothing was done. In both of these districts, on account of the severe prevalence of plague, the people were found most averse to get their children re-vaccinated, labouring under a misapprehension that inoculations for plague were meant to be enforced under the guise of re-vaccinations. The Deputy Commissioners and Civil Surgeons of these districts tried their best to remove this erroneous idea from the minds of the people, but without success ; and after many fruitless attempts on the part of the vaccinators to carry on re-vaccinations, the matter was dropped. District Staff. Percentage of success. Statement No. 1. 10. Of the total number of primary vaccinations performed by the District Staff, 99.26 per cent. were reported successful in 1904-05 and 99.23 in 1903-04, or almost exactly in the same proportion, calculating on the total cases in which the results were known. The percentage of success varies slightly in different districts. As regards re-vaccinations, the precentage amounted to 81.64, showing a satisfactory increase of 5.19 compared with the previous year. The percentage of cases in which the results were unknown to total cases was very much higher in re-vaccinations, being 15.21, as against 2.63 in primary vaccinations. Compared with the previous year, the percen- tage in the case of re-vaccinations, however, shows a decrease of 2.27, As regards primary operations, the rate of unknown cases remains almost the same. Ratio of persons success- fully vaccinated per 1,000 of population. Statement No. I. 11. The rate of persons successfully vaccinated by the District Staff per 1,000 of population was 30.02 in 1904-05, compared with 29.10 and 28.49, respectively, in 1903-04 [and 1902-03, show- ing a slight but steady increase in the work during the triennial period. In several districts the proportion of those vaccinated is very much below the provincial ratio. The attention of Civil Surgeons will [be drawn to this, with the view to strenuous efforts being made to increase the work during the next vaccinating season. Special Staff. Statement No. I and Appendix to Statement No. 1. 12. The amount of work done by the Special Staff in 1904-05, as regards primary vaccinations, was slightly in excess of that of the last year and considerably greater than that of the year be- fore last. The actual figures were in 1902-03 only 31,086, in 1903-04 the number increased to 43,132 and in 1904-05 to 44,033. There was a very large increase in re-vaccinations, the total operations in 1904-05 amounting to 6,649 as against 2,820 and 3,202 in the preceding two years. The work of the Special Staff is very satisfactory, taking into consideration that the average number of vaccinators employed in 1904-05 was four less than in the previous two years. Two vaccinators were brought under reduction in 1904-05 on account of the re-organization of the Staff. The Special Staff did most of the work in certain tahsils in the districts of Hissár, Karnál, Jhang,Gujrán wála and Hoshiár- pur, and in the Bashahr and Biláspur States, in the summer, but owing to the opposition of the people in some of the smaller Hill States, they could not do much work. Of the total primary vaccinations in which the results were known 98.07 per cent. were successful in 1904-05, showing a slight increase of 0.21 as compared with the previous year. The percentage of success in re-vaccinations was 66.95 as against 71.57. Cantonment Staff. Appen- dix to Statement No. 1. 13. The work of the Cantonment Staff was, on the whole, slightly bet- ter than in the previous two years. The total primary- operations in 1904-05 were 4,406, an increase of 352 over the number done in the preceding year. The amount of work in 1903-04 and 1902-03 was nearly equal. The number of re-vaccinations in 1904-05 amounted to 2,806, showing a slight decrease of 143 compared with the previous year, and an increase of 318 over the number performed in 1902-03. The percentage of successful primary operations was 98.56 and of re-vaccinations 85.49, showing
4 an increase of 0.69 in the rate of successful primary vaccinations and no less than 10.21 in that of successful re-vaccinations, as compared with the preceding year. There was a larger percentage of successful re-vaccinations in the cantonments of Siálkot and Mian Mir. Dispensary Staff. State- ment No. III. 14. The total number of primary vaccinations performed at the dis- pensaries was 281 in 1904-05 and 19 and 110 in the previous two years, and the number of re-vaccinations 28,8 and 96, respectively. The percentage of successful primaryo perations in 1904-05 was 95.73 and of successful re-vaccinations 46.43. The reasons for the small number of operations performed by the Dispensary Staff were stated in paragraph 8 of the Vaccination Report for 1899-1900. I think it is unnecessary to give a separate statement for such an insignificant amount of work. Inspection Work, State- ment No. V. 15. During the year 1904-05 I inspected 1,865 primary vaccinations and 1,140 re-vaccinations, and found 99.36 per cent. of primary cases and 87.63 of re-vaccinations successful. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner verified 6,119 primary operations and 547 re- vaccinations, of which 98.27 and 68.01 per cent. were found successful. Details of the work done by other Inspecting Officers are given in Statement No. V attached to this Report. It will be seen that the Civil Surgeons inspected about seven per cent. and the Superintendents of Vaccination nearly seventy per cent. of the total primary cases vaccinated, or about as large a number as in the preceding two years, the re-vaccinations inspected by the Superintendents being sixty per cent., or about eight per cent. greater. As there was an increase in the number of Divisional Inspectors, the amount of inspection work done by them was larger. The Civil Surgeons found 98.69 per cent of the primary cases and 74.06 of re-vaccinations successful, the Superin- tendents of Vaccination 98.45 and 77.07, and the Divisional Inspectors 97.66 and 65.42, as against 99.17 and 81.05 reported by the vaccinators. Vaccination in large Na- tive States. 16. The large Native States maintain their own establishments. Their vaccination work is noticed in the Vaccination Reports year by year, but not included in the returns. The state- ments received for 1904-05 show that in the .Patiálá State the vaccination work, which is under the supervision of Major C. H. James, I. M. S., was very satisfactory during the year, the total operations amounted to 79,482, an increase of 28,763 on the previous year, which was, however, one of the lowest on record. The increase is partly accounted for by the use of glycerinated vaccine supplied by the Provincial Animal Lymph Depôt, which enables work to be carried on much more rapidly and with less trouble. Of the total number, 48,490 were primary vaccinations and 30,992 re-vaccinations. The percentage of success reported by the vaccinators was 99.34 in primary cases and 79.55 in re-vaccina- tions. In Baháwalpur, the next largest State, there was a total of 20,065 operations, showing an increase of 2,665 over the number reported in the preceding year. Almost all the cases were primary operations. The per- centage of successful primary vaccinations was reported to be 95.08. In the Kapurthala State, a total of 4,833 operations was performed, including only six re-vaccinations, and 906 less than in the previous year. In the Farídkot State the number of total vaccinations was 5,856, a decrease of 458 compared with last year. The primary operations were 5,488 and re-vaccinations 368. In the Jínd State there were 6,697, all primary cases, being 1,945 in excess of the number vaccinated last year. The percentage of successful primary vacci- nations reported in the Kapurthala State was 96.81, in Farídkot 98.42 and in Jínd 97.76. Vaccination work in municipal towns Appen- dix A. 17. The vaccination work in municipal towns is shown in Appendix A to this Report, By adding up the figures in columns 4 and 5 of the statement, it will'be seen that, of the total number of children under one year of age available for vac- cination in 1904-05, no less than forty per cent. remained unprotected against small-pox in towns in which vaccination is optional, and twenty-seven per cent. in those in which the Vaccination Act is in force. Vaccination is generally better attended to in the case of towns in which it is compulsory ; but even in these there is evidently much room for improvement, particularly in large cities like Amritsar, Delhi, Multán, Jullundur and Ambala, and I see no reason
5 why the provisions of the Act should not be more strictly enforced. Plague is, no doubt, responsible, to a certain extent, for the deficiency in vaccination noticed in a large number of towns, but the operations can be carried on with- out much trouble during the earlier months of the vaccinating season when plague is generally not severe. Animal Lymph Depôt. 18. Captain W. F. Harvey, the Officiating Deputy Sanitary Commis- sioner, deserves much credit for his efficient supervision of the work of the Animal Lymph Depôt. Glycerinated lymph is manufactured at the depôt in large quantities, and its use is being gradually extended. Since the 1st January glycerinated vaccine is freed from all non-sporing bacteria by the use of chloroform. During the ensuing vaccina- ting season operations will be carried on in the districts of Lahore, Amritsar and Gurdáspur with this kind of lymph. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, C. J. BAMBER, LIEUT.-COLONEL, I. M. S., Sanitary Commissioner, Punjab.

No. 39/1740. FROM LIEUTENANT-COLONEL C. J. BAMBER, I.M.S., Sanitary Commissioner, Punjab, To A. B. KETTLEWELL, ESQUIRE, C. S., Secretary to Government, Punjab. Dated LAHORE, the 30th June 1906. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit, for the information of His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab, the annual vaccination returns for the Province for the year 1905-06, with the following remarks:2 showing an excess of ten per cent. over the figures of 1904-05. By adding the work done by the Special Staff during the year in certain tahsils to that of the District Staff, it appears that Kangra is the only district in which a noticeable decrease took place in 1905-06, and was due to the employment of the Vaccinators on special earthquake relief duty. &quot;With reference to the question raised in the first paragraph of the review on the last report, regarding the inclusion of the work of the Special Staff in the district returns, a separate communication will be addressed to Government. Re-vaccination. 8. District Staff.3 and 71.40 of re-vaccinations successful and the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner 99.93 and 81.03. There was a very considerable increase in the inspection work of Civil Surgeons in some of the districts in which it was insufficient in the previous year. The total operations inspected by all the Civil Surgeons were nearly twice as large as in 1904-05. There were, however, a few districts in which the work was comparatively very small, but I hope it will be better next year. The Civil Surgeon of Sialkot made no inspections on account of the large number of vaccinations verified by me in that district. The Civil Surgeon of -Lahore is unable to leave the headquarters on account of his multifarious duties, but the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner inspected a sufficient number of cases in this district. The work done by the Subordinate Staff was, on the whole, satisfactory. Vaccination in the large Native States. 15. As noted in my last report, the vaccinations, both primary and secondary, done in the Patiala State in 1904-05, were con- siderably greater than in the year preceding. In 1905-06 there was a further increase in primary cases, the number having risen from 48,490 to 54,086. There were 31,034 re-vaccinations performed during the year against 30,992 in 1904-05. The work done in the other States was as follows: A.ii A.iii. DEPARTMENT. IN THE PUNJAB PROVINCE DURING THE YEAR 1905-06. 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 VACCINATION.

No. 1790. FROM LIEUTENANT-COLONEL C. J. BAMBER, I.M.S., Sanitary Commissioner, Punjab, To A. B. KETTLEWELL, ESQUIRE, C.S., Secretary to Government, Punjab. Dated LAHORE, the 1st July 1907. SIR, I have the honour to submit, for the information of His Honour the Officiating Lieutenant-Governor, the prescribed vaccination statements for 1906-07 with the following brief remarks. Administration. 2. I held charge of the Vaccination Department throughout the year. The office of Deputy Sanitary Commissioner was held by Captain W. H. C. Forster, I.M.S., from the 1st April to the 26th July 1906 and by Captain H. M. Mackenzie, I.M.S., from the 27th July 1906 to the end of the official year. Strength of the vaccina tion establishment. State ment No. II. 3. The strength of the vaccination establishment was the same as in the previous year, that is, five Divisional Inspectors, thirty Superintendents, and two hundred and sixty-six Vacci- nators. Cost of the department. Statement No. II. 4. The total cost of the department amounted to Rs. 99,605, or Rs. 1,903 in excess of the expenditure in the previous year. The increase occurred mostly under the following heads:2 control. The work of each vaccinator, as shown in the fortnightly returns sub- mitted by the Civil Surgeons to my office, was closely watched by me, and there were very few instances in which the deficiency was due to neglect on the part of the vaccinating staff. District Staff. Percentage of success, Form No. I 8. Of the total primary vaccinations performed by the District Staff, 99.39 per cent. were reported successful, showing an in- crease of 0.14 as compared with the results obtained in the previous year. The amount of success in re-vaccinations was 79.62 per cent. as against 83.78 in 1905-06. These percentages are calculated on the total number of cases in which the results were known. The total primary operations include 2.40 per cent. of those cases in which the results were not known, as against 2.27 in the year preceding. As regards re-vaccinations, the percentage of unknown cases was 15.17 compared with 14.64 in 1905-06. Ratio of persons success- fully vaccinated. State- ment No. I. 9. During the year the number of successful vaccinations performed by the District Staff was at the rate of 29.08 per 1,000 of population. This ratio is 2.9 per mille less than that of the previous year, but it approaches most closely the average annual rate of 29.16 for the preceding quinquennial period. Annual Form No. I and its appendix. 10. Special Staff.3 the other Native States show a decrease in their vaccination work in 1906-07. As regards the quality of work done in the Native States, the percentage of success in primary cases ranges from 87.59 in Nabha to 98.99 in Patiala. In Patiala the percentage of successful re-vaccinations was 77.75. In all the other States, the number of re-vaccinations was very insignificant. Vaccination work in municipal towns, Appen- dix A. 16. Of the total number of children under one year of age available for the operation in 1906-07, seventy one per cent. were success- fully vaccinated in the towns in which the Vaccination Act is in force and sixty-seven per cent. in those in which it is not compulsory, as against eighty-five and sixty-six per cent., respectively, in 1905-06 and seventy-three and sixty per cent. in 1904-05. Vaccination is better attended to in the towns where it is compulsory, but even in these, much improve- ment could be effected by a strict application of the provisions of the Act. Results of glycerinated vaccine. 17. It appears from the report furnished by Captain Mackenzie, who was in charge of the Central Vaccine Institute, that during the months of November to February 152,080 primary vaccinations and 24,603 re-vaccinations were performed with chloroformed glycerinated vaccine with an average case success of 99.88 per cent. and insertion success of 98.72 per cent. in primary operations, and a case success of 81.00 per- cent. and an insertion success of 80.16 per cent. in re-vaccinations. These results are most satisfactory. Captain Mackenzie deserves much credit for the efficient manner in which he supervised the work of the Institute. The Central Vaccine In- stitute. 18. The Punjab Government have sanctioned the scheme proposed by me for the expansion of the work of the Central Vaccine Institute, with the view to supply tubed vaccine to every district of the province. The plans and estimates of the proposed buildings are being scrutinized by the Public Works Department. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, C. J. BAMBER, LIEUT.-COL., I.M.S., Sanitary Commissioner, Punjab.

READ2 better financial prospects. The Sanitary Commissioner has recorded elsewhere that the villages distinctly prefer the tubed vaccine as there are fewer bad arms and as their calves are not impressed. The cost of the vaccine will in future be 10 annas the gramme. 6. The most important event in the history of the triennium has been the transfer in the beginning of 1908 of the control of the vaccinating staff from the Sanitary Commissioner to the local bodies, by which the staff is paid. The transfer is not yet complete as the Sanitary Commissioner's concurrence has still to be obtained to the dismissal of members of the old pensionable staff, but as these men die or retire the control of the local bodies will extend till it becomes complete, and the Sanitary Commissioner will remain only as an advising and inspecting officer. There is reason to hope that this important step will not only eventually mean a real increase of local self-government, but may also be a measure to popularize vaccination. 7. The report consists of a minute examination of statistics which is not very informing. The Lieutenant-Governor thinks that more life might be given to future reports if they dealt less in the body of the report with statistics and more with such matters as the attitude of the people towards vaccination in different tracts, the system on which the vaccinators work and their relations to the people, the attitude of the local bodies, the conflict between religious preju- dice and practical prudence, and so on.

WILKINSON, F.R.C.S., I.M.S., Officiating Sanitary Commissioner, Punjab, To W. M. HAILEY, ESQUIRE, I.C.S., Secretary to Government, Punjab. Dated LAHORE, the 1st July 1908. SIR, I have the honour to forward, for the information of His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab, the Annual Vaccination Returns for the year 1907-08. In the previous two reports the most important points were dealt with briefly ; the present report, which is for the triennial period ending March 31st 1908, deals more fully with the work of the Vaccination Department. Administration. 2. The charge of the Vaccination Department was held from the com- mencement of the year to the 29th October 1907 by Lieute- nant-Colonel C. J. Bamber, I.M.S., and from the 30th October to the end of the year by me. The appointment of Deputy Sanitary Commissioner was held by Captain H. M. Mackenzie, I.M.S., for the first three days of April. I resumed charge of the appointment, from April 4th to November 15th when I was relieved by Major Perry, I.M.S., who continued to officiate until the end of the year. From October 30th to November 15th I held charge of the appointments of Sanitary Commissioner and Deputy Sanitary Commissioner. Establishment. Statement No. II. 3. The strength of the vaccination establishment remained constant throughout, both during the year 1907-08 and the triennial period under report, namely, 5 Divisional Inspectors of Vaccination and of Registration of Births and Deaths, 30 Superintendents of Vaccination and 266 Vaccinators. Under the recent orders of Government, conveyed in Punjab Government Proceedings No. 203, dated the 26th February 1908, the district vaccination staff has been placed under the immediate control of the local bodies concerned. The Divisional Inspectors and Superintendents of Vaccination, however, still remain under the direct control of the Sanitary Commissioner. In the case of the existing establishment with pensionary rights the concurrence of the Sanitary Commissioner must be obtained before a vaccinator can retire or be dismissed. Cost of the Department. Statement No. II. 4. The total cost of the Department during 1907-08 amounted to Rs. 104,112 compared with Rs. 99,605 in 1906-07 and Rs. 97,702 in the year 1905-06. Compared with 1906-07 there has been an increased expenditure of Rs. 4,506. This is mainly due to the larger salary drawn by the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, the increase amounting to Rs. 3,600. There is also an increase of Rs. 1,666 under the heading &quot;Contin- gencies &quot; which is more than accounted for by the cost of preparing the much larger amount of vaccine issued from the Punjab Vaccine Institute. Average cost of each successful case. Statement No. II. 5. In the year 1907-08 the average cost of each successful vaccination was Re. 0-2-7 compared with Re. 0-2-5 and Re. 0-2-3 in the years 1906-07 and 1905-06, respectively. The average for the triennial period under review was Re. 0-2-5, or exactly the same as in the previous triennial period. Total operations perform- ed by all establishments. Statement No. I. 6. The total number of operations performed by all establishments during the triennial period under-report amounted to 2,161,641 against 2,072,420 during the previous period, an increase of 89,221. The figures for 1907-08 were 707,683 compared with 705,219 for 1906-07 and 748,739 for 1905-06. Primary vaccination forms by far the largest part of the total vaccination operations and it is by the proportion of children successfully vaccinated to those available for the operation that the efficacy of the work of the Vaccination Department can best be
2 estimated. During the three seasons 1902-1905 the total number of children available for vaccination was 2,063,111, and of these 1,315,186, or 63.75, were successfully vaccinated. The number of children available for vaccination during the period 1905-08 was 1,964,604 of which 1,354,127 or 68.93 per cent. were successfully vaccinated. Without discussing here the conditions which have led to a diminution of nearly 100,000 in the number of children available for vaccination during the present triennium, the fact that under these conditions the proportion of children successfully vaccinated has increased by more than five per cent. may, I think, be accepted as an indication of progress in the Vaccination Department. Of the total operations 1,828,674 were primary3 The largest decrease, rather more than 4,000 occurred in Gujranwala and was more than 3,000 in Shahpur. District Staff, percentage of success. Annual Form No I. 9. The percentage of success in primary vaccinations performed by the district staff during 1907-08 was 99.09 as against 99.39 in 1906-07 and 99.25 in 1905-06. The percentage of success in re-vaccinations was 76.29 in 1907-08 as against 79.62 in 1906-07 and 83.78 in 1905-06. The percentage of vaccinations in which results were not known to total number in 1907-08 was, as usual, much less in the case of primary vaccinations, being 2.33 as against 14.92 in re-vaccinations. The corresponding figures for the previous two years are 2.40 and 15.17 in 1906-07 and 2.27 and 14.64 in 1905-06. Ratio of persons success- fully vaccinated per 1,000 of population. Statement No. I. 10. The number of persons successfully vaccinated by the district staff during the year 1907-08 was at the rate of 28.9 per 1,000 of population, compared with 29.08 in 1906-07 and 31.98 in 1905-06. The corresponding rate during the triennial period ending 1907-08 was 29.99 as against 29.2 for the preceding period. Special Staff. Total oper- ations.

The Act was introduced in the Municipal towns of Mianwali, Ludhiana and Khushab during the triennial period under report. The Civil Surgeon of Ludhiana reports a great improvement in the primary vaccina- tion of that town following upon the introduction of the Act. The Civil Surgeons of the respective districts advise the adoption of the Vaccination Act by the Municipalities of Hissar and Bhiwani; Ferozepore; Bhakkar, Kalabagh and Karor; and Muzaffargarh. The Deputy Commissioner of Mianwali, however, doubts the advisability of the introduction of the Act into the towns mentioned of his district which he says are more like villages. Punjab Vaccine Institute. 18. A total of 12,258 grammes of chloroformed glycerinated vaccine was issued by the Punjab Vaccine Institute during 1907-08. In 1905-06 the amount issued was 4,970 grammes and in 1906-07, 7,995 grammes. During the present season vaccine was distributed as follows :A.ii A.iii DEPARTMENT.

Secretary to Government, Punjab. Dated LAHORE, the 1st July 1908. SIR, In submitting herewith for the information of His Honour the Lieutenant- Governor the prescribed vaccination statements for the year 1908-09, I have the honour to make the following brief notes. Administration. 2. Major E. Wilkinson, F.R.C.S., I.M.S., held charge of the Vacci- nation Department throughout the year, the office of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner being held by Major E. L. Perry, I.M.S. Mr. H. C. Phillips, 4th class Military Assistant Surgeon, who was selected for the appointment of Superintendent of the Punjab Vaccine Institute, sanctioned by the Government of India, took over charge of the post on the 15th October 1908. Strength of the Vacci- nation Establishment. Statement No. II. 3. The strength of the Vaccination Establishment employed during the year was 5 Divisional Inspectors of Vaccination, 30 Super- intendents of Vaccination and 264 Vaccinators, or a decrease of 2 vaccinators compared with the previous year. The 2 vaccinators of the Special Staff, Punjab, who came under reduction were absorbed into the district and cantonment staffs to fill up vacancies that had occurred. Cost of the Department. Statement No. II. 4. The total cost of the Department which amounted to Rs. 1,14,761 was Rs. 10,650 in excess of that in the previous year. The increase is due (a) to the pay of the vaccinators in certain districts being increased in accordance with the recent orders of Government directing that vaccinators may be promoted to the next higher grade after a certain number of years' service in a grade, (b) to the grant of bonus of one week's pay in some districts and compensation for dearness of provision, and (c) to contingencies due to the vaccine being supplied on payment instead of free as before. The increase under the head Special Staff is due (1) to the pay of the Superin- tendent of the Institute, and (2) to contingencies on account of the output of work being larger than in previous years. Cost per successful case. Statement No. II. 5. The average cost of a successful case this year worked out to annas three and pie one as against annas two and pies seven in the year preceding. The increase is accounted for partly by the fact that vaccine this year was paid for and partly to the lesser number of operations performed. If, however, the cost of the vaccine sold which amount- ed to Rs. 12,038 is deducted from the expenditure, the average cost works out to annas two and pies nine. Total operations done by all establishments. State- ment No. I. 6. There was a decrease in the total number of primary vaccinations, but a slight increase of 20,583 re-vaccinations. Of the total number of operations there was a decrease of 38,785. The decrease is manifestly due to the havoc caused by the epidemic of malaria and its consequent ill effect on the infantile popu- lation. The fact that there was a decrease of 10.43 per cent. in the total number of children available for vaccination, and an increase of 4.76 per cent. this year in the ratio of successful primary operations to total number of children available may be regarded as an indication of the Vaccination Staff having worked fairly satisfactorily. As an improvement house-to-house vacci- nation might be introduced experimentally in a few places. This has proved a great success in England in popularising vaccination and is very likely to prove equally successful in this country. Vaccinators are now provided with vaccine
2 direct from the Punjab Vaccine Institute, and no time is spent in vaccinating calves in the districts, the time thus saved might be spent by the vaccinators in going to the houses where the birth registers show that there are children to be vaccinated; this would be also a good method for the distribution of quinine. This measure will meet with opposition from some of the vaccination staff, but the people will undoubtedly welcome a measure that will save them from the exertion and annoyance of taking their children to a distance. Under the recent orders of Government when a second operation is per- formed on the same individual, it should not be included in the total number of persons vaccinated. This, however, has not been done in all the districts, as the orders in question were received late in the vaccination season. Full instructions have been issued and the orders will be complied with in future. District Staff. Statement No. I. 7. District Staff.3 Cantonment staff. State- ment No. I and its appen- dix. 12.

No. 41/2150. FROM MAJOR E. WILKINSON, F. R. C. S., D. P. H., I. M. S., Officiating Sanitary Commissioner, Punjab, To THE HON'BLE MR. H. P. TOLLINTON, B.A., I.C.S., Secretary to Government, Punjab. Dated LAHORE, 1st July 1910. SIR, I have the honour to forward for the information of His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab, the Annual Vaccination Returns for the year 1909-10. Administration, 2. I held charge of the Vaccination Department from the commencement of the year to the 10th May 1909, when I was transferred to Eastern Bengal and Assam. From the 11th May to the end of the year Lieutenant-Colonel C. J. Bamber, I.M.S., held charge. The appointment of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner was held by Major E. L. Perry, I.M.S., throughout the year. Mr. H. C. Phillips, 3rd Class Military Assistant Surgeon, held the appoint- ment of Superintendent, Punjab Vaccine Institute, all the year, except from 18th August 1909 to 2nd October 1909, when he proceeded on privilege leave. During his absence Mr. E. Fox, 2nd class Military Assistant Surgeon, of the Pasteur Institute of India, Kasauli, officiated for him in addition to his own duties. Strength, of Vaccination Establishment. Statement No. II. 3. The strength of the vaccination establishment employed during the year was 5 Divisional Inspectors of Vaccination, 30 Superin- tendents of Vaccination and 265 Vaccinators, or an increase of one vaccinator as compared with the previous year. The increase was due to a vaccinator having been re-entertained in the Sialkot district to complete the scale sanctioned for that district. Under orders conveyed in Punjab Government No. 389, Home (Medical and Sanitary), dated the 21st April 1909, Superintendents of Vaccination were also placed under the administrative control of local bodies. At present therefore only Divisional Inspectors are under the direct control of the Sanitary Commissioner. Cost of the Department. Statement No. II. 4. The total cost of the department amounted to Rs. 1,20,509, as against Rs. 1,14,761, in the previous year. The increase of Rs. 5,748 is due (a) to the pay of the vaccination staff in certain districts being increased for the reasons given in the last year's report, and (b) to the contingencies on account of house rent paid for vaccination stations in certain municipalities and cost of vaccine supplied on payment from the Punjab Vaccine Institute. The increase under the head of pay of the Special Staff is partly due to the pay and the grade promotion of the Superintendent and partly to the pay of the additional clerical staff sanctioned and entertained at the end of 1909 for the Institute. Cost per successful case. Statement No. II. 5. The average cost of a successful case in 1909-10 was three annas and three pies compared with three annas and one pie in the year 1908-09. If the cost of the vaccine sold which amounted to Rs. 11,540, and has since been refunded into the treasury be deducted from the expenditure, the average cost is reduced to annas two and pies eleven compared with annas two and pies nine for the previous year.
2 Total operations done by all establishment. State- ment No. I. 6. The total number of operations performfed by all establishments during the year amounted to 670,536 compared with 668,898 in the previous year. Of the total number of operations performed 528,347 were primary vaccinations and 142,189 re-vaccinations compared with 523,087 and 145,811, respectively, in the previous year. The number of persons vaccinated amounted to 664,371 against 668,898 for the year preceding. Vaccine operations were carried out under considerable difficulties in both these years3 out of the seven vaccinators this year being quite new to the work. The diminu- tion in the Mianwali district is accounted for by the transfer of the Leiah tahsil to the Muzaffargarh district. There was also an increase of 45,370 re-vaccinations as compared with the previous year's work in 17 districts and decrease of 37,974 in 12 districts. The largest fall was in the Kangra district where re-vaccinations numbered as high as 20,061 in the previous year and the same number could not be expected every year. The people on the whole are well disposed towards primary vaccination, but it is still a matter of some difficulty to persuade parents to have their girls re-vaccinated. District Staff. Percentage of success. Statement No. I. 9. The number of primary vaccinations performed by the District Staff was 507,492 with a percentage of success of 97.63 as com- pared with 500,775 and 98.49 in the previous year. The re-vaccinations amounted to 127,724 and the ratio of success to 75.12 per cent. as against 120,228 and 77.79 respectively in 1908-09. The slight decrease in per- centages is due to the vaccine operations having been started with glycerinated lymph obtained from the Punjab Vaccine Institute in some districts in October and early in November when the temperature was high. The percentages are cal- culated by excluding from the total those operations of which the results are not known. In the case of primary and re-vaccinations the percentage of un- known cases was 3.10 and 14.40 as compared with 2.44 and 15.36 in the year preceding. Ratio of persons success- fully vaccinated per 1,000 of population. Statement No. I. 10. The number of persons successfully vaccinated by the District Staff during the year was at the rate of 27.93 per mille of popu- lation as against 27.83 in 1908-09. Special Staff. Statement No. I and its appendix. 11. The special staff vaccinators performed 28,778 operations, of this number 16,870 were primary and 11,908 re-vaccinations, showing a decrease of 1,778 and 11,478, respectively, as compared with last year. The diminution is attributed to (a) the large number of re-vaccinations done in Rampur Bashahr, Bilaspur, and Mandi States during the previous year compared with that under report, and to the number of cases available for re-vaccination being consequently much less in 1909-10; (b) operations being entirely confined to the hills where the number of children available for vaccination is much less than in the plains; (c) to two vaccinators of the Special Staff, Punjab, remaining on leave during the year and no sub- stitutes having been entertained in their place. Percentage of successful cases. 12. The percentage of success of operations performed by the Special Staff was 95.92 in primary and 65.09 in re-vaccinations as against 96.55 and 72.94 in 1908-09. Cantonment Staff. State- ment No. I and its appen- dix. 13. In ten cantonments which entertain their own vaccinators there was an increase of 24 primary operations and of 479 re-vacci- nations over those of the previous year. The percentage of success in primary operations was 98.58 and in re-vacci- nation 71.77 against 99.17 and 73.42 in 1908-09. The percentage of unknown cases to total cases was 1.81 in primary and 11.41 in re-vaccination compared with 1.2 and 9.27 in 1908-09 and 3.35 and 12.55 in 1907-08 respectively. Dispensary Staff. State- ment No. III. 14. There was an increase of 297 primary and a decrease of 119 re- vaccinations in the work done by the Dispensary Staff. The percentage of success amounted to 97.42 in primary and 85.47 in re-vaccination compared with 98.27 and 52.60 respectively in the year preceding. Inspection work. State- ment No. V. 15, Lieutenant-Colonel C. J. Bamber, I. M. S., Sanitary Commissioner, inspected 942 primary operations and 62 re-vaccinations, and the ratio of success found by him was 94.48 in primary and 24.19 in re-vaccination. Major Perry, Officiating Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, inspected 587 primary operations and 353 re-vaccinations with a percentage of success of 96.93 in the former and 54.96 in the latter. The percentages of success found by Civil Surgeons were 96.50 in primary and
4 78.13 in re-vaccination against 96.09 and 71.26 by Superintendents of Vacci- nation, 93.87 and 61.40 by Divisional Inspectors of Vaccination and 97.58 and 74.28 reported by vaccinators, as compared with 97.75 and 80.04, 98.12 and 74.14, 96.99 and 46.40, and 98.43 and 77.00, respectively in the previous year. Vaccination in large Native States. 16. The vaccination operations performed in the large Native States which employ their own vaccinators were as follows:A.ii A.iii DEPARTMENT.

OF ERRATA FOR THE PUNJAB VACCINATION REPORT FOR 1910-11. 1. Appendix BNo. 27/1820 FROM MAJOR E. WILKINSON, F.R.C.S., D.P.H., I.M.S., Sanitary Commissioner, Punjab, To THE HON'BLE MR. R. HUMPHREYS, B.A., I.C.S., Revenue Secretary to Government, Punjab. Dated Lahore, 1st July 1911. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit, for the information of His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab, the Annual Vaccination Returns for the year 1910-11. Brief remarks on the most important points in the returns for 1908-09 and 1909-10 were made in the Annual Vaccination Notes for those years ; the present report deals more fully with the vaccination work porformed during the triennial period ending March 1911. Administration. 2. The charge of the Vaccination Department was held by Colonel C. J. Bamber, I.M.S., from the com- mencement of the year to 2nd June. From this date onward I held the appointment to the end of the year. The appointment of Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Punjab, was held by Major E. L. Perry, I.M.S., from the 1st April to 28th November 1910, when he was relieved by Captain C. A. Gill, I.M.S., who remained in charge to the end of the year. Mr. H. C. Phillips, 3rd class Military Assistant Surgeon, held the appointment of Superintendent, Punjab Vaccine Institute, throughout the year. Strength of Vaccination establishment. Statement No. II. 3. The strength of the Vaccination establishment was 5 Divisional Inspectors, 30 Superintendents and 267 Vaccinators in 1910-11 or 2 vacci- nators more than in the previous year. As compared with the previous triennial period, the number of Divisonal Inspectors and Superintendents remained the same. In regard to vacci- nators, however, the following changes took place in the period under review, i. e., 264 vaccinators in 1908-09, 265 in 1909-10 and 267 in 1910-11 as against 266 throughout the previous triennial period. The reasons of decrease in 1908-09 and of increase in 1909-10 have already been given in the Annual Vaccination Notes for those years and the reasons for the variation in 1910-11 are (1) entertainment of three vaccinators by Municipal Committees of Karnal, Panipat and Kaithal to meet their requirements ; (2) reduction of two 4th class vaccinators in the Kangra district
2 owing to the poor financial condition of the District Board; (3) decrease of one in the Jullundur cantonment where the appointment remained vacant and the operations were performed by a vaccinator from the District Staff in addition to his own work ; (4) decrease of one vaccinator in the Lahore district on account of transfer of the Sharakpur tahsil to the Gujranwala district; (5) the increase of 3 vaccinators in Gujranwala district for work in its new tahsil. The cost of the department. Statement No. II. 4. The aggregate cost of the Department amounted to Rs. 1,21,076 as against Rs. 1,20,509 in the previous year. The increase of Rs. 567 was entirely due to the higher rate of pay drawn by Major E. L. Perry, I.M.S., Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Punjab, on confirmation in his appointment on the 12th July 1910. If the expenditure of the Special Vaccination Staff be excluded from the total cost of the department there would be a decrease of Rs. 1,552 owing to a diminution in the pay of establishment. The total cost of the department during the triennial period was Rs. 3,56,346 as compared with Rs. 3,01,419 in the previous period showing an increase of Rs. 54,927 under the sub-heads of pay of the Deputy Sanitary Com- missioner, Superintendent of Punjab Vaccine Institute and clerical establishment and District Vaccination Staff who have been promoted in accordance with the new time scale lately introduced, and higher expenses under the sub-head of contingencies on account of the cost of Vaccine Institute and price of vaccine supplied to local bodies on payment from the Punjab Vaccine Institute since 1908-09. Cost per successful case. Statement No. II. 5. The average cost of each successful vaccination worked out in 1910-11 to two annas and ten pies compared with three annas and three pies in 1909-10 and three annas and one pie in 1908-09. If the cost of the vaccine sold which amounted to Rs. 11,742, and which has been credited to Government be deducted from the expenditure, the average cost would be two annas and seven pies as against two annas and eleven pies in 1909-10 and two annas and nine pies in 1908-09. The average for the triennial period 1908-11 excluding the cost of lymph refunded into the treasury was two annas and nine pies. Total operations done by all establisment State- ment No. I. 6. The total number of operations performed by all establishments during the triennial period 19083 The percentage of successful primary vaccination of children under one year of age performed by them during the triennial period under report was 71.62 against 68.93 in the preceding period which is also satisfactory. House to house vaccination. 7. A further trial of house-to-house vaccination was made this year and 55,094 operations were performed. The system is reported by most Civil Surgeons to be unsuccessful for the reasons given in paragraph 7 of the notes on vaccination in 1909-10. It is preferred in the districts of Hoshiarpur, Gurdaspur and Ludhiana, and the Civil Surgeon of Delhi reports that in his district the system is preferred by the people, as it saves them a great deal of time and trouble but still they will not assist the vaccinators and so make the system a success. The Civil Surgeon of Lahore reports that the system of house-to-house vaccination was introduced in the towns and large villages of his district and proved a success. District tuff. Statement No. I. 8. In the triennial period under report the number of operations per- formed by the district staff amounted to 1,995,751 against 1,954,659, an increase of 41,092 over the figures for the previous period. Of this 1,629,123 were primary and 366,628 re-vaccinations. Compared with the figures for the previous triennial period there is a decrease of 35,483 in primary and an increase of 76,575 in re-vaccinations. The diminution in primary vaccination is entirely due to the smaller number of children available for vaccination in 1908-09 and 1909-10. A great improvement was made, however, in 1910-11 when 113,364 operations more than in the preceding year were performed and every district shared in the increase. In the district of Amritsar the increase was more than 12,000, next to which comes Hissar with an increase of over 7,000 operations, increases of more than 5,000 operations were noticed in the districts of Gujrat (6,945), Lyallpur (6,591), Gujranwala (6,273), Sialkot (5,491) and Multan (5,094). In Hoshiarpur, Gurdaspur, Shahpur, Jullundur and Ferozpore, the excess was also considerable and amounted to over 4,000 in each of these districts. Compared with the work of the preceding year there was a decrease of 9,048 re-vaccinations in 1910-11 and out of 29 districts 17 showed a decline in the number of operations performed, due chiefly to the greater prevalence of plague. The decrease was most marked in the Delhi division which was the part of the Province most severely affected with plague. The people frequently object to re-vaccination under a misapprehension that inocu- lations for plague were meant to be enforced under the guise of re-vaccination. The percentage of male to total number of re-vaccinations in 1910-11 was 67.79 and that of female 32.21 against 68.91 and 31.09 in 1909-10; as stated in previous reports the reason for fewer females being re-vaccinated is that people do not wish their young girls to be seen by vaccinators. District Staff4 Ratio of persona Successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population.5 The total number of persons vaccinated amounted to 801 in 1910-11 as compared with 919 in 1909-10 and 748 in 1908-09.

WILKINSON, F.R.C.S., I.M.S., Sanitary Commissioner, Punjab, TO E. R. ABBOTT, ESQUIRE, I.C.S., Offg. Revenue Secretary to Government, Punjab. Dated Lahore, the 1st July 1912. SIR, I HAVE the honour to forward, for the information of His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab, the Annual Vaccination Statements for the year 1911-12. Annual Statement No. I has been prepared in the form revised in accordance with letter No. 1511, dated 16th August 1911, from the Government of India, Education Department, received with Punjab Govern- ment endorsement No. 724 M. & S., dated 11th September 1911. Administration. 2. I held charge of the Vaccination Department throughout the year. The appointment of Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Punjab, was held from April 1st to September 7th and again from January 2nd to March 18th by Captain C. A. Gill, I.M.S., and from September 8th to January 1st by Major H. M. Mackenzie, I.M.S., and from March 19th to the end of the year by Major W. C. H. Forster, I.M.S., who held it in addition to his own duty as Professor of Pathology in the Medical College, Lahore. Mr. H. C. Phillips, 3rd Class Military Assistant Surgeon held the appointment of Superintendent, Punjab Vaccine Institute, throughout the year. Strength of Vaccination establishment2 prevalent in many towns and districts of the province during the year. The towns principally affected were Delhi and Lahore and the districts Jhelum, Mianwali, Delhi and Rawalpindi. At the commencement of the vaccination season the attention of all Civil Surgeons was invited to the prevalence of small-pox and the consequent necessity for special attention to vaccination. House-to-house vaccination. 7. The experiment of house-to-house vaccination was again carried out this year and 105,400 operations were performed in this manner. The system is appreciated in the districts of Hissar and Jullundur and is liked by the people of the Gurdaspur district where 20,318 operations were performed. In the remaining districts it did not prove a success, partly because of the inter- ference with the privacy of the people, and partly to the delay and wastage of time of Vaccinators. Experience shows that a much larger staff would be required to perform vaccinations by this system. Moreover in doing house-to- house vaccination vaccine lymph has to be exposed to the sun frequently, thus giving unsatisfactory results. The Civil Surgeon of Rawalpindi reports that a Vaccinator was beaten when performing house-to-house vaccination. In view of these circumstances, I do not recommend any further trial of this experiment, though in places where a distinct demand is made for house- to house vaccination it might be carried out should it be found to require no increase in the vaccination establishment. District staff.3 rotation to the Native States and other localities mentioned in Appendix to Statement I appended to this report. Owing to the prevalence of small- pox the Vaccinators were, however, occasionally employed independently to check the spread of the disease. Percentage of successful cases. 12. The percentage of success of operations performed by the special staff was 90.67 in the case of primary vaccination and 63.37 in that of re- vaccination as against 94.39 and 67.97, respectively, in the preceding year ; the reasons for the decline in the percentage of success as given in para- graph 18 are also applicable to the work done by the special staff. Cantonment Staff4 year being 72 and 62 per cent. Similar percentages of successfully vaccinated children were in Delhi 85, Amritsar 70, and Multan 74 as compared with 66, 55 and 70 respectively in 1910-11. In Lahore after deducting infantile deaths from births the number of children available was 5,506 while those successfully vaccinated were 7,674 : this, no doubt, includes children born elsewhere but residing within the limits of the municipality at the time of vaccination. The municipal towns of Ferozepore, Fazilka, Muktsar, Zira and Dharmkot in the Ferozepore district and Kalabagh in the Mianwali district came under the provisions of the Vaccination Act during the year and a proposal to extend the Act to the town of &quot;Wazirabad in the Gujranwala district is under consideration. The Civil Surgeon of Multan reports that &quot; a man was given two weeks' simple imprisonment for continued disobedience to the orders of the court to get his child vaccinated.&quot; Result of chloroformed glycerinated vaccine. 18.

The Lieutenant-Governor observes with satisfaction the remarks of the Sanitary Commissioner in regard to the gratifying results of the improved conditions under which lymph is prepared in the new Vaccine Institute. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, J. P. THOMPSON, Revenue Secretary to Government, Punjab. Punjab Government Press, LahoreNo.2 the number of primary operations probably indicates that the limit of what is possible under present conditions has been approached. The percentage of success was 97.99 in the case of primary and 73.50 in revaccination as against 95.03 and 71.85 in 1911-12, showing a satisfactory improvement which is confirmed by other figures to be referred to later. House - to - house vaccination. 6. In accordance with the orders contained in paragraph 2 of the review of the Local Government on the Annual Vaccination Notes for 1911-12, house-to-house vaccination was only carried out in a few districts as the system did not prove a success in others. It has been reported that under this method 40 operations were performed in Simla, 84 in Attock, 102 in Rawalpindi, 143 in Muzaffargarh, 720 in Gurgaon, 817 in Montgomery, 1,201 in Jhelum, 2,415 in Lyallpur, 2,462 in Jhang and 23,428 in the Gurdaspur districts during the year under report; the Gurdaspur district is the only one in which this system has proved popular. The Civil Surgeon reports that it is very much liked by the people, but he gives no reasons, and I confess I am unable to explain the fact for everywhere else it has been the reverse of successful. District staff. Statement No. I. 7. The total number of operations performed by the district staff in 1912-13 was 937,781 as against 842,174 in 1911-12. Of the total operations, 664,912 were primary operations and 272,869 revaccinations as compared with 674,159 and 168,015, respectively, in the previous year. An increase in primary operations was recorded in 17 districts; the excess was most marked in Dera Ghazi Khan and amounted to 7,481, next to which comes Rohtak with an increase of 7,242 ; increases of more than 4,000 were recorded in Jhang and Gurgaon ; in the district of Hoshiarpur the increase amounted to 3,201, in Karnal to 3,139, in Kangra to 2,904, in Amritsar to 2,054, in Multan to 1,602, and in Ambala to 1,187. On the other hand, there was a decrease in 11 districts, those in which it was most marked being Lahore 9,109, Gujrat 5,851, Ferozepore 4,348, Lyallpur 4,158, and Hissar districts 3,791; the diminution is explained as being due to the smaller number of children available for such operation. The percentage of successful primary vaccination of children under one year of age to the total number available for such purpose was 74.30 or 2.80 per cent., more than that recorded in the previous five years, which is satisfac- tory. In regard to revaccination there was an increase in 21 and a decrease in 7 districts, namely, Hissar, Rohtak, Gurgaon, Lahore, Gujrat, Jhelum and Muzaffargarh. The decrease in Lahore was 6,500 operations, Rohtak and Hissar districts 2,732 and 1,952, respectively, and in four others it was insigni- ficant. The increase in the district of Kangra was over 23,000, in Dera Ghazi Khan more than 18,000,in Amritsar over 10,000, and in Rawalpindi, Ludhiana, Sialkot, Jullundur, Hoshiapur, Lyallpur and Gujranwala between nine and five thousand. The percentage of success in primary vaccination was 98.04 as against 95.15 in the previous year, while in the case of revaccination it was 73.44 in 1912-13 as compared with 72.69 in 1911-12. The percentage of vaccinations in which results were not known to total number in 1912-13 was 3.66 in the case of primary vaccination and 17.26 in that of revaccination as compared with 4.27 and 16.04, respectively, in the year preceding. Persons success- fully vaccinated per 1,000 of population. Statement No. I. 8. The number of persons successfully vaccinated by the district staff was 40.94 per mille of population as against 36.22 in the previous year. The rate of 40.94 is the highest on record and slightly in excess of the rate in 1888-89 when it was 40.84. Special staff. Statement. No. I and its appendix. 9. The special staff vaccinators performed 73,814 operations, of which 36,997 were primary and 36,817 revaccination as against 21,705 and 16,068, respectively, in the year preceding. This very large increase in vaccination and more especially in revaccination is doubtless a natural sequence to the unusual prevalence of small-pox, but is also to be attributed to the fact that this year vaccinators of the special staff were employed in several districts in the plains of the Punjab to assist the district staff in combating the spread of the disease, where there were probably more children available for vaccina- tion than in the Hill States to which their activities are generally confined in ordinary times. The percentage of success of operations performed by the special staff was 97.30 in the case of primary vaccination and 74.68 for revaccination as against 90.67 and 63.37 in 1911-12. Cantonment staff. Annual Form No. I and its appendix. 10. The total number of operations performed in the cantonments which entertain their own vaccinators amounted to 4,861 primary and 5,788 revacci- nations compared with 4,913 and 5,839, respectively, in 1911-12. The largest number of primary vaccinations performed were 1,845 in Ambala, 750 in Rawalpindi, and 714 in Ferozepore cantonments.
3 The percentage of success was 97.90 in the case of primary and 75.79 in that of revaccination as against 97.83 and 71.36, respectively, in the previous year and the ratio per cent. of unknown cases to total cases in the case of pri- mary was 1.95 and in revaccination 7.86 as compared with 1.53 and 4.37 in 1911-12. Diepensary staff. Statement No, III. 11. At dispensaries the total number of operations performed were 10,603 as compared with 1,590 in the preceding year. Of the 10,603 opera- tions 4,224 were primary and 6,379 revaccination as against 923 and 667 in 1911-12. The ratio of success in primary was 95.97 and in revaccination 67.22 as compared with 95.13 and 61.62 in the previous year. The largest numher of persons vaccinated at dispensaries was 4,621 in the Jullundur dis- trict, 2,074 in Ferozepore, 1,576 in Lahore, and 821 in Gujrat districts which were all badly infected with small-pox. Inspection work. Statement No. V. 12. Lieutenant-Colonel Wilkinson inspected 578 primary vaccinations, of which 185 were unsuccessful in the Pindigheb tahsil of the Attock district and 17 primary and 18 revaccinations in the Simla district. The percent- age of success in those seen by him was 68.74 in the case of primary and 22.22 in that of revaccination. The work done at Pindigheb was not satis- factory, and action was taken to punish the vaccinators at fault. In addi- tion I inspected vaccinated children in certain districts and found the work done well, yielding a ratio of success of 97.44 per cent. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Punjab, visited 213 towns and villages in different localities of the province and inspected 2,416 primary and 1,281 revaccinations. The ratio of success in the former was 93.63 per cent, and that in the latter 68 62 per cent. Civil Surgeons made 60,166 inspections of primary vaccinations and 16,572 of revaccinations; Divisional Inspectors 100,881 and 13,787, and Superintendents of Vaccination 463,826 and 157,322, respectively. The per- centages of success verified by Civil Surgeons were 96.37 in primary and 63.75 in revaccination as compared with 91.46 and 57.89 and 96.86 and 73.29 found by Divisional Inspectors and Superintendents, respectively. The rates of success reported by vaccinators were 98.00 in primary and 73.63 in revaccina- tion as against 95.04 and 71.97 in the previous year. Vaccination in large Native States. 13. The number of vaccination operations performed in the large Native States which employ their own vaccination establishment was as follows:4 better stabling and separation this difficulty should disappear to a great extent. The Institute supplied vaccine lymph to all the civil districts and to 26 Native States in the Punjab, to the North-West Frontier Province, Kashmir and Jammu, Baluchistan, Sind, Kathiawar, Nepal, Tibet and Afghanistan, to Mili- tary Medical Officers in the Punjab and North-West Frontier Province, and to private individuals. The total number of tubes issued was 34,942, sufficient for the vaccination of 1,747,100 persons (4 insertions each) as compared with 28,971 tubes (sufficient for 1,448,550 persons) in the previous year as detailed below : A.ii A.iii DEPARTMENT.

He held charge of that office from 16th October 1913 till the end of the year. Strength of vacci- nation establishment. Statement No. II. 3. The number of Divisional Inspectors and Superintendents of Vacci- nation remained the same as last year, viz., 5 Divisional Inspectors and 30 Superintendents, but there were 268 vaccinators or 5 less than in the previous year The difference is due to the reduction of 2 vaccinators in the Kangra District and 5 vaccinators in the Lyallpur District who were specially enter- tained last year to combat the prevalence of small-pox, whilst 2 new vacci- nators were taken on, one in each of the districts of Karnal and Jhang. During the triennium under report the average number of vaccinators was 273 as against 265 in the preceding triennium, a considerable increase, notwithstanding the removal of Delhi from the Province and the enormous reduction of the labour of vaccination consequent on the introduction of tube lymph. Cost of the depart- ment . Statement No. II. 4. In 1913-14 the cost of the department amounted to Rs. 133,731, an increase of Rs. 7,919 on the previous year. This has been mainly due to the creation of the appointment of Additional Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Punjab, the higher pay of the permanent Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, and increase in the contingent charges of the Punjab Vaccine Institute, the work of which is steadily growing. The total cost of the district staff shows a decrease of Rs. 1,261 during 1913-14 from its cost in 1912-13 The total cost of the department for the triennium under report was Rs. 3,83,862 and for the preceding triennium Rs. 3,56,346. The increase of Rs. 27,516 is under the sub-heads of pay of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners, their clerical establishment, district vaccination staff, travelling allowance and contingencies. Cost of each suc- cessful case. State- ment No. II. 5. The average cost of each successful vaccination was in 1911-12 Re, 0-2-8, in 1912-13 Re. 0-2-4, and in 1913-14 Re. 0 2-10. After deducting cost of vaccine sold, the average cost in triennium under report was Re. 0-2-2 ; in preceding triennium Re. 0-2-9.
2 Total operations done by all establish- ments. Statement No. I. 6. The total number of operations performed by all establishments during the triennium under report was 2,812,605; during the preceding triennium 2,104,509. Of the increase, 395,746 were primary and 312,350 re-vaccinations. The increase was general throughout the Province, but was most marked in the districts of Dera Ghazi Khan (53,498), Lahore (47,723), Gujranwala (45,139), Amritsar (41,181), Rohtak (34,361), Muzaffargarh (32,942) and Gurgaon (30,194). The principal reason for the increase in primary vaccination is that early in the preceding triennium the Province suffered terribly from malaria which enormously reduced vaccination. The increase in primary vaccinations in the triennium under report was shared by all districts. In Lahore the increase was 32,383, in Rohtak 28,688, and in Amritsar 25,212. An important contributary factor in the increase of re-vaccinations was the severe epidemic of small-pox in 1912-13. In 1913 14 this factor was absent, and hence in that year there was a great fa ling-off in re-vaccinations. Except in Hoshiarpur and Karnal which showed slight decreases, the increase in re- vaccinations during the triennium under report was shared by all districts. In Dera Ghazi Khan the increase was 35,561, in Gujranwala 30,729, and in Kangra 16,520. The vaccinations in each year were as follows : 3 In 1912-13 vaccination, and in particular re-vaccination, was greatly stimulated by the severe epidemic of small-pox which then prevailed. This stimulus was absent in the year under report; hence the decrease. Great opposition to re-vaccination is still experienced in all parts of the Province. The Civil Surgeon of Karnal reports that the master of a private school at Panipat, who had all his pupils, over 100 in number, re-vaccinated lost his appintment in consequence. In the review on last year's report it was pointed out that the increase in vaccination in 1912-13, though attributed to the presence of small-pox, showed district by district little or no relation to the intensity of the epidemic. A principal factor accounting for this is the difference in the attitude of the people of a locality towards epidemic diseases in general. We know from long ex- perience that the people of the hills as compared with those of the plains regard visitations of infectious diseases, such as plague, cholera and small-pox, with the greatest apprehension and take extraordinarily active measures to limit their spread. The people of the plains, on the other hand, are only too often regrettably indifferent and apathetic in the presence of such outbreaks. The tact and industry of the district vaccination staffs have, however, a very great deal to do with such variations in the amount of work. Special staff. State- ment No. I and its appendix. 12. The work of the special staff was as follows :4 Commissioner inspected 16,269 primary vaccinations (91.7 per cent. successful) and 4,087 re-vaccinations (41.5 per cent. successful). The 1st Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, therefore, inspected far two- few vaccinations and the Additional Deputy Sanitary Commissioner inspected far too many. It is of great importance that the inspections of vaccination made by Deputy Sanitary Commissioners should be as detailed and thorough as possible. I am convinced that the Additional Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, who has a vast amount of general sanitary inspection to do, could not inspect over 20,000 vaccinations except in a hurried and cursory manner. The percentages of success returned by the various inspecting agencies were as follows:5 like this came from many other districts and from the North-West Frontier Province.

No. 3705. FROM COLONEL C. J. BAMBER, I.M.S., Offg. Sanitary Commissioner, Punjab, To THE HON'BLE MR. C. A. BARRON, C.I.E., I.C.S., Offg. Financial Secretary to Government, Punjab. Dated Lahore, the 1st July 1915. SIR, I HAVE the honour to forward, for the information of His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab, the annual vaccination statements for the year 1914-15. Administration. 2. Many changes were effected in the appointments of the Sanitary Commissioner, Deputy and Additional Deputy Sanitary Commissioners, and Superintendent, Punjab Vaccine Institute, during the year under report. The post of Sanitary Commissioner was held as follows:2 Cost of each success- ful case. Statement No II. 5. The average cost of each successful vaccination was Re. 0-3-3 as compared with Re 0-2-10 in the previons year. If, however, the sum of Rs. 21,974, Which has been credited to Government on account of the cost of vaccine sold, is deducted from the total expenditure, the average cost works out to Re. 0-2-9 for the year under report as compared with Re 0-2-4 in the preceding year. The increase in the cost of a successful case is due partly to the decrease in the number of successful re-vaccinations and partly for the reasons given in the preceding paragraph. Total operations done by all estab- lishments. Statement No. I. 6. The number of operations performed by all establishments in 1914-15 was 836,639 as compared with 887,469 in the previous year. Of the total number of operations, 671,261 were primary and 165,378 re-vaccination as against 671,183 and 216,286 in the year preceding, an increase of 78 oper- ations in the case of primary and a decrease of 50,908 in that of re-vaccination, which is manifestly due to the increased demand for the same in the previous year on account of the great prevalence of small-pox. House-to-house vac- cination. 7. It is reported that this year also the system of house-to-house vaccination was not appreciated by the people in most districts, and hence no attempt was made to extend it. Total number of operations perform- erd by the district staff. Statement No. I. 8 The total number of operations performed by the district staff in 1914-15 was 782,988 as against 823,995 in the previous year. Of the total operations, 642,778 were primary and 140,210 re-vaccination as compared with 642,877 and 1,81,118 respectively in the year preceding. In 14 districts an excess was recorded in primary vaccination, being most marked in Lyallpur, where it amounted to 3,746, next to this being Rohtak with an in- crease of 1,896 ; increases of more than 1,000 were recorded in Amritsar, Hissar, Montgomery and Ludhiana, and in 8 others the excess varied between 992 in Ferozepore and 42 in Gurgaon. On the other hand, there was a decrease in 14 districts, those in which it was most marked being Dera Ghazi Khan 4,135, Muzaffargarh 3,842, Multan 3,010, Rawalpindi 1,839, Hoshiarpur 1,351, Jhang 1,308, Sialkot 839, Jhelum 731 and Ambala 528. In Dera Ghazi Khan the diminution is due to the fact that a large number of vaccination operations were performed in the hills beyond the administrative border in the previous year, and in other districts the decrease is explained as being due to the smaller number of children available for such operation owing to the prevalence of plague, malaria and famine when the people left their homes for other places. The ratio of successful primary vaccination of children under one year of age to the total number available for such purpose was 73.41 per cent. against 72.67 per cent. in the previous year. In spite of the causes above mentioned, this is an indication of the district vaccination staff having worked well during the year under report In regard to re-vaccination, there was a decrease in all the districts of the Province, except Rohtak, Kangra, Jullundur, Gurdaspur Attock and Multan, partly due to the epidemic of plague and partly to the fact that in previous years there was an increased demand for protection against small-pox which was prevalent in a severe epidemic form. In some districts the diminution is also attributed to the difference in the popula- tion of areas selected for re-vaccination. The people on the whole are well disposed towards primary vaccination, but it is still a matter of difficulty to persuade parents during years when there is very little small-pox to have their girls re-vaccinated. The percentage of males to total number of re-vaccinations was 68.55, while in the case of females it was only 31.45 or less than 50 per cent. of the former. The percentage of success in primary vaccination was 97.15 as against 97.41 in the previous year, while in the case of re-vaccination it was 70.78 as compared with 70.36 in the year preceding. The percentage of vaccinations in which results were not known to total number in 1914-15 was 4.34 in the case of primary vaccination and 18.48 in that of re-vaccination as compared with 3.84 and 17.90, respectively, in the previous year. Ratio of persons suc- cessfully vaccinated per 1,000 of popula- tion. Statement No. I. 9. The number of persons successfully vaccinated by the district staff was 34.98 per mille of population as against 36 45 in the previous year.
3 Special staff. Statement No. I and its appendix. 10. There were 23,328 primary and 23,738 re-vaccinations performed by the special staff, as against 21,917 and 32,886 respectively last year This shows an increase of over 6 per cent. in the number of primary vaccinations and a diminution of 27.8 per cent. in re-vaccination as compared with the figures for the year 1913-14. With reference to the latter, the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner noticed, during his tours of inspection through most of the Simla Hill States, that the people object to their children being vaccinated under 3 or 4 years of age, and the vaccinators, in order to make up for the dearth of young infants, perform numerous re-vaccinations on older children and adults. The staff have been prohibited from re-vaccinating children under 6 or 7 years of age, and they have been further advised to make every effort, with the assistance and co-operation of the State authorities and village headmen, to persuade the parents to permit children under one year or so to be vaccinated. The percentage of success of operations performed by the special staff was 96.25 in the case of primary and 70.16 in re-vaccination as against 96.88 and 74.77 in 1913-14. Cantonment staff. Annual Form No. I and its appendix. 11. The total number of operations performed in cantonments, which entertain their own vaccinators, amounted to 3,775 primary and 1,318 re-vaccinations compared with 3,985 and 1,568 respectively in the previ- ous year. The largest number of primary vaccinations performed were 1,220 in Lahore, 1,079 in Ambala, 743 in Ferozepore and 719 in Rawalpindi Cantonments. In 1914- 5, 99.08 per cent. of primary and 70.04 per cent. of re-vaccinations were returned as successful, and the ratio of unknown cases to total cases in the case of primary was 1.64 per cent. and in re-vacci- nation 402 as compared with 1.38 and 6.06 in 1913-14. Dispensary staff. Statement No . III. 12 As compared with last year there was a decrease of 1,024 primary and 602 re-vaccinations performed at dispensaries owing to the absence of small-pox in epidemic form. The ratios of success were 97.07 per cent. in the case of primary and 83.96 per cent. in that of re-vaccination as against 96.24 and 80.67 in 1913-14. Inspection work. Statement No. V. 13. Major H. M. H. Melhuish, I.M.S., inspected 542 primary and 369 re-vaccinations. The percentage of success in the former case was 95.20, and in that of the latter 48.78. During the short period that Major H. M. Mackenzie was Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, he inspected 174 primary (98.85 per cent. successful) and 66 re-vaccinations (50.00 per cent. success- ful). The Additional Deputy Sanitary Commissioner inspected 11,813 vaccinations in six districts, 9,251 being primary and 2,562 re vaccina- tions, out of which 8,579 and 1,426 were found successful, giving a percentage success of 92.74 and 55.66 respectively. The percentage of success returned by the other various inspecting agencies were as follows:4 In compliance with paragraph 3 of the review on last year's report, the attention of the municipal authorities was invited to the orders of Govern- ment, and they were urged to realize more fully their responsibilities in the cause of vaccination and to co-operate with the vaccination staff. During the year under report the Vaccination Act, XIII of 1880, was extended to the municipal town of Alipur in the Muzaffargarh District and the question of extension of the Act to the municipalities of Palwal and Sialkot is under the consideration of Government. Punjab Vaccine In- stitute. 16. The Institute supplied vaccine lymph to Civil Surgeons through- out the Province, to Native States in the Punjab, to the North-West Frontier Province, Jammu and Kashmir States, and Military Medical Officers, etc. The total number of tubes issued was 31,726 as compared with 33,329 as detailed below;A.ii A.iii DEPARTMENT.

LUMSDEN, I.C.S., Financial Secretary to Government, Punjab, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. Dated Lahore 21st July 1916. Home. Sanitary. SIR, I AM directed to forward, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of the Sanitary Commissioner's Notes on Vaccination in the Punjab during the year 1915-16. The death-rate from small-pox in 1915 was lower than in any year since the introduction of the system of registration of deaths; in these circumstances the increase of over 20,000 in the number of re-vaccinations performed during the year under review reflects credit on the vaccination establishment. The number of primary vaccinations was also most satisfactory, for though the actual number of such operations was less by 2,025 than in the previous year, the proportion of the children available vac- cinated was greater and amounted to over 99 per cent. 2. The percentage of successful re-vaccinations was 2.6 better than in the previous year, but there was a slight falling off in the ratio of success obtain- ed in primary operations, which is attributed to the effect on some of the lymph supplied of the excessive heat in certain districts. There was a very considerable increaseSANITARY DEPARTMENT. IN THE ANNUAL VACCINATION NOTES OF THE PUNJAB FOR l915-l6. Memo. of Errata. 1.

In the Annual Vaccination Report of the Punjab for 1917.18No. 2550. FROM THE HON'BLE COLONEL H. HENDLEY, K.H.S, M.D., I.M.S., Sanitary Commissioner, Punjab, To THE HON'BLE MR. O. F. LUMSDEN, I.C.S., Financial Secretary to Government, Punjab. Dated 1st July 1918. SIR, I HAVE the honour to forward, for the information of His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab, the annual vaccination statements for the year 1917-18. Adminiatratiotn 2 The post of Sanitary Commissioner was held by me throughout the year in addition to that of Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals. The appointment of Deputy Sanitary Commissioner and Additional Deputy Sanitary Commissioner was held, respectively, by Major W. H. 0. Forster, I.M.S., in addition to his duties as Professor of Pathology of the Lahore Medical College and Dr. K A. Rahman, M.B , Ch. B. (Edin), D.P.H. (London). The post of Superintendent, Punjab Vaccine Institute, was held by Temporary Assistant Surgeon Lala Prem Nath Suri. Strength of vaccina- tion establishment, Statement No. II. 3. The number of Divisional Inspectors (5) and Superintendents of Vaccination (30) remained unaltered during the year, but the number of vacci- nators employed increased from 277 in 1916-17 to 285. The increase is due to the entertainment of 1 vaccinator, paid from the Provincial Funds for vaccination in the hills, one for smaller municipalities in the Dera Ghazi Khan District, one each for the Dera Ghazi Khan and Rupar Municipalities, 3 temporary vaccinators employed in the Kangra District for 3 months and 1 in the Hissar District for 4 months. Cost of the depart- ment. Statement No. II. 4, The cost of the department amounted to Rs. 1,30,591, a decrease of Rs. 12,583 compared with the figures for the previous year. The difference is explained by the fact that under Government orders the pay of the Civil Surgeons' clerks (amounting to Rs. 1 ,414 last year) ceases to be shown as a charge against the Vaccination Department. Apart from this, however, there was an increase of expenditure of Rs. 2,831 chiefly due to grade promotion in the vaccination staff. Cost of each success- ful case. Statement No. II. 5. The average cost of each successful vaccination was Re. 0-3-0 as compared with Re. 0-3-1 in the previous year. The difference given in the average cost of a successful case is due to the reasons stated in the preceding paragraph. If, however, the sum of Rs. 25,722 which has been credited to Government on account of the cost of vaccine sold, be deducted from the total expenditure, the average cost works out to Re. 0-2-5 as compared with Re. 0-2-6 in the previous year. Total operations done by all establishments. Statement No. I. 6. The total number of operations performed by all establishments was 804,229 showing a decrease of 104,409. Of this number 621,650 were primary and 182,579 re-vaccinations as compared with 705,338 and 203,300, respectively, in the previous year. The decrease of 83,688 in primary vaccina- tion is held to be due to fewer infants being available for vaccination in con- sequence of the high infantile mortality that occurred during the widespread epidemic of malaria in the autumn of 1917. The decrease of 20,721 in re-vaccina- tions is said to have been due to re-vaccination being performed in those parts of the Province which were relatively less populous than in those in which re- vaccination was carried on last year, also to the very marked lessened prevalence of smallpox and the greater prevalence of malaria. People realize the value of
2 primary vaccination and, as a rule, welcome the vaccinator, but in the case of re-vaccination it is different; few understand the necessity for it with the result that it is only practiced at all freely in the presence of an epidemic of smallpox. House to house vac- cination. 7. There was a total of 17,735 operations performed under the house to house system in 9 districts, viz., 60 in Simla, 178 in Jhelum, 240 in Amritsar, 629 in Montgomery, 1,037 in Ferozepore, 1,087 in Shahpur, 1,162 in Karnal, 2,988 in Hissar and 10,354 in Lahore including 7,854 in the Lahore Munici- pality. District stuff. Statement No. I. 8. The total number of operations performed by the district staff was 738,797 as against 841,186 in the previous year showing a decrease of 102,389. There was a decrease of 83,634 and of 18,755 in primary and re-vaccinations respectively. In the case of primary operations 7 districts recorded an excess and 21 a decrease. The diminution is partly due to the fact that in some of the districts vaccinators were sent for training to the Punjab Vaccine Institute and they were replaced by vaccinators from the Special Staff, Punjab, whose work is shown separately, and partly to the reasons given in paragraph 6. This year the Special Staff, Punjab, vaccinated a whole tahsil in the Lahore District instead of only a few villages as in forager years. The percentage of males and females to total number of re-vaccinations was 65.95 in the case of males and 34.05 in that of females as against 6698 and 33.02 in the preceding year. The percentage of success in primary vac- cination was 98.25 as against 95.22 in the previous year, while in the case of re-vaccination it was 77.16 as compared with 71.89. This satisfactory result may well be due to the training of the vaccination staff in the Punjab Vaccine Institute. The percentage of vaccinations in which results were not known to the total number in 1917-18 was 4.80 in the case of primary and 18.71 in that of re-vaccination as compared with 5.31 and l9.64, respectively, in the year preceding. Ratio of persons successfully vacc- nated per 1,000 of population. Statement No. I. 9. The number of persons successfully vaccinated by the district staff was 33.09 per mille of population as against 36.12 in the previous year. Special staff. Statement No. I and its appendix. 10. The vaccinators of the Special Staff, Punjab, performed 38,201 primary operations and 15,032 re-vaccinations as compared with 38,193 and 14,467 in the year 1916-17. The percentage of success was 97.34 in the case of primary operations and 73.66 in that of re-vaccination as against 92.69 and 70.72, respectively, in 1916-17. Cantonment staff. Annual Form No. 1 and its appendix. 11. The work done in those cantonments which entertain their own vaccinators amounted to 3,965 primary vaccinations and 6,781 re-vaccinations, an increase of 123 in the case of the former and a decrease of 2,567 in the latter over the corresponding figures for last year. The largest number of persons vaccinated was 5,996 in Lahore, 1,496 in Ambala and 1,202 in Rawal- pindi Cantonments.

Punjab Vaccine In- stitute. 18. The exportation and manufacture of medicinal glycerine having been practically stopped in consequence of the war it has become necessary to find some reliable substitute for the glycerinated chloroformed lymph issued as standard lymph from the Punjab Vaccine Institute. As Major W. H. 0. Forster's experiments in this connection had led him to believe that chloral hydrate gives as good a bacterial purification of the lymph as glycerine and choloroform, and is as satisfactory if not superior to glycerine, as a dilluent and preservative, Government sanction was accorded to the use of this drug as an experimental measure. The new lymph was used in the whole of Lahore Tahsil, from December to March, by a small body of the Provincial Vaccina- tion Staff and a report on the results obtained is under preparation. As usual chloroformed glycerinated vaccine was supplied by the Punjab Vaccine Institute during the year. It has been reported that the supply was regular and of good quality. The total number of tubes issued was 49,087 as compared with 42,438 in the previous year as detailed below :A.ii A.iii DEPARTMENT. IN THE PUNJAB PROVINCE DURING THE YEAR 1917-18. RE-VACCINATION.
