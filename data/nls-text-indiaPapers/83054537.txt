REPORT ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS OF THE CENTRAL PROVINCES, FOR THE YEAR 1895. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Nagpur: PRINTED AT THE SECRETARIAT PRESS. 1896. [PRICE ONE RUPEE.]
No. 3718. Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner, Central Provinces, in the General Department, dated Pachmarhi, the 3rd June 1896. READ- Letter No. 934-542, dated the 5th March 1896, from the Alminiatrative Medical Officer Central Provinces, forwarding the Annual Report and Statements of the Lunatic Asylums in the Central Provinces for the year 1895. RESOLUTION. The total population of the two Asylums during the year 1895 was 381, or five in excess of that of last year, the figure for Nagpur being 207, and that for Jubbulpore 174. The daily average strength was 317.95 (Nagpur 170.87, Jubbulpore 147.08). 2. The percentage of patients cured to total population was 6.30, as against 5.32. These figures are still low as compared with those of other provinces, though the proportion is greater than at Rangoon in 1894 (5.92), and nearly equal to that at Tezpur in the same year (6.85). The Administrative Medical Officer is unable to give any complete explanation of this fact, but it is probably due to a difference of practice in dealing with criminal lunatics who recover wholly or partially, but whom it is not thought prudent to release from the Asylum. 3. The percentage of deaths to daily average strength was 7.23, while that for last year was 8.99. The general health of the patients also showed an improvement, the total admissions to hospital being 229, or less by 87 than the figures for 1894. There were no deaths from cholera or smallpox, though there were two cases of the latter disease at Jubbulpore during the year ; both occurred in patients who had been vaccinated, and in one case the patient had previously suffered from the disease. 4. At the close of the year there were, in the Nagpur Asylum, 69, and in the Jubbulpore Asylum 31 criminal lunatics. Many of these are now. doubtless, as the Superintendent of the Jubbulpore Asylum observes, quite harmless, and are only detained in the absence of friends to take care of them. The Chief Commissioner has reason to think that some of the persons so detained may have altogether recovered their reason, and that their detention in the Asylum may be due to neglect of the instructions conveyed in Book Circular No. LXIII, dated the 19th December 1888, which adopted (with a few slight modifications) the Bengal rules for the treatment of such lunatics. These rules provide for recovered criminal lunatics, who are fit for such employment, being transferred to Central Jails as prisoner or jail warders. Mr. Lyall will be glad if the Administrative Medical Officer will draw the attention of the Superintendents of the two Asylums to the correspondence of 1888, as well as to Chapter XXV of the Report of the Commission of 1889 on Jail Management in India.
2 5. Of the 67 admissions, five are said to be due to the effects of hemp drugs, but doubts are expressed as to whether three of these are genuine cases of toxic insanity; the fact being that most of the lower classes, from whom the majority of the admissions are drawn, are smokers of ganja, and the habit, when known to exist, is apt to be ascribed as a cause. The Chief Commis- sioner observes a remarkable difference between the two Asylums as regards the record of causes of insanity : at Nagpur, of 42 admissions the cause in 38 eases is returned as " unknown", at Jubbulpore, of 25 admissions the number shown as "unknown" is six only. 6. A dairy farm was started during the year at the Nagpur Asylum, with a fair amount of pecuniary success, for the venture cleared its expenses during the first year, and in future, now that the initial expenses have been covered, may be expected to yield a considerable profit, besides affording healthy and congenial employment to some of the inmates of the Asylum. The lunatics were also employed on oil-pressing and cloth-making, besides their regular work in the gardens attached to the two Asylums; the last is the occupation which, Mr. Lyall believes, is found -generally most suitable to lunatics, and most beneficial in its effects on their mental condition. 7. The total cost of the Asylums was Rs. 25,176, against Rs. 22,937 in the preceding year ; the increase is chiefly due to the cost of diet, owing to the larger number of patients dealt with and the higher average price of food-grains. The nett profits of manufactures were, at Nagpur, Rs. 1,358-10-1, and at Jubbulpore, Rs. 1,017-8-10. The average annual cost per lunatic was, at Nagpur, Rs. 64 -5-10, and at Jubbulpore, Rs. 61-13; the increase at Nagpur being chiefly due to the extra expenditure on the -dairy noted above. The corresponding figures for last year wereNo. 934-542. FROM SURGEON-COLONEL J. H. NEWMAN, M. D., ADMINISTRATIVE MEDICAL OFFICER, Central Provinces, TO THE CHIEF SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces, Dated Nagpur the 5th March 1896. SIR, I have the honour to forward for submission to the Chief Commis- sioner, Central Provinces, the Annual Report and Statements of the Lunatic Asylums in the Central Provinces for the year 1895. 2. Surgeon-Major G. F. A. Harris and Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel H. K. McKay held charge of the Nagpur and Jubbulpore Lunatic Asylums, respectively, throughout the year. ADDITIONS AND ALTERATIONS. 3. At Nagpur the only addition and alteration to the buildings were that the workshed was slightly lengthened by taking in a small space between the shed and the west wall of the north enclosure, and the opening out of an entrance into this enclosure, by the introduction of a small iron-door so as to allow easy access to the latrine and urinal within. The bathing tank having been considered to be rather too deep, and therefore unsafe, a smaller one has been constructed on the model of those in the Central Jail. The usual annual repairs, whitewashing, &c., have been duly carried out. The system of trenching the Asylum night-soil has been altered, and the plan used at the Allahabad Grass Farm has been adopted, 4. There were no additions or alterations to the Jubbulpore Asylum build- ings. The annual repairs were carried out by the Public Works Department as usual. The ground in front of the Asylum was brought under cultivation this year, tilli and dhal having been sown. The crop was not very good owing to the scanty rainfall at the end of the year. The extra accommodation required for European and Eurasian patients has not been taken in hand as yet owing to the want of funds. All the buildings are in good order. STATEMENT I. 5. Population.2 6. Jubbulpore Asylum. The number on 31st December 1894 was 149, of whom 115 were males and 34 females; 16 males and 6 females were admitted and 3 males re-admitted, giving a total population of 174, or 6 less than in 1894. 7. The number of patients discharged from the Nagpur Asylum during 1895 was 19, or 1 more than in the preceding year; of these, 11 were cured, 3 improved, 3 not improved, and 2 otherwise. At Jubbulpore the number was 15, or 1 less than last year. Of these 13 were cured, and 2 otherwise. 8. The daily average strength at Nagpur was 170.87, or 9.67 more than in the preceding year; and at Jubbulpore the average was 3.02 less compared with 1894. 9. The percentage of cured to the daily average strength was greater by 2.10 in Nagpur; and at Jubbulpore the increase was very slight, viz., 0.18 more than in 1894. 10. The year was a fairly healthy one in both Asylums, the percent- age of deaths to daily average strength was less, as compared with 1894. Nagpur.

This point was referred to in the Chief Commissioner's review of the report for 1894. Neither of the Superintendents can exactly explain the low proportion of cures they show. It certainly arises from no want of care or interest in the patients on their parts, and probably results from some slight variation in procedure. In both the Central Provinces Asylums there are numerous non-criminal harmless lunatics who could be discharged if any friends would take them, but they have to be kept under detention, as opportunities for placing them out cannot be found. STATEMENT II. 13. At Nagpur there were 15 fresh admissions of criminal lunatics against 12 in the previous year. At Jubbulpore 5 fresh admissions were made against 6 in the preceding year. There were also 2 re-admissions at the former and 2 at the latter.
3 14. The daily average strength of criminal lunatics in 1895 was higher at Nagpur, viz., 63.23 against 58.24 in 1894; and at Jubbulpore it was less by 2.34, i. e., 30.85 against 33.19 in the preceding year. 15. With reference to paragraph 4 of Government of India Resolution No. 84 TABLE II.5 24 The following table gives the various causes of deaths at both the Asylums :6 29. The drawings from the Treasury at Nagpur were Rs. 10,103-4-7 in 1895 as against Rs. 8,073-5-5 in the preceding year, an excess of Rs. 2,029-15-2. The causes contributing to the increase were :7 33.

The average annual cost per head at Nagpur was Rs. 64-5-10 against Rs. 56-8-3 in the preceding year, or an increase of Rs. 7-13-7. At Jubbulpore it was Rs. 61-13-0 against Rs. 60-1-1 in the preceding year. The increase observable at Nagpur occurs under the heads diet and contingencies, and is due to the high price of food-grains. 35. The daily average strength of lunatics employed on manufacture and garden is shown below :8 So far the scheme has worked most successfully. For the first half year's working the results have been an expenditure of Rs. 593-9-4(Rs. 322-8-0 of which went to purchase live-stock) with an income of Rs. 593-5-2. With more dairy animals to use, further progress is confidently expected. 37. Both Asylums were inspected by me during the year. The Superin- tendents in charge, Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel H. K. McKay and Surgeon- Major G. F. A. Harris, are most efficient officers, and the Deputy Superin- tendents, 1st Class Civil Hospital Assistant Abdul Majid Khan at Nagpur, and 1st Class Civil Hospital Assistant Mohan Lall at Jubbulpore, are both deservedly highly praised for their excellent work. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, J. H. NEWMAN, M. D., Administrative Medical Officer, Central Provinces.
9 Report on the Nagpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1895. STATEMENT NO. I. Admissions and di scharges. There were 40 admissions into the Asylum during the year, viz.:10 STATEMENT II. Fifteen criminal lunatics, all males, were admitted during the year as against 12 in 1894 and 14 in 1893. Of these 12 were from the Central Provinces and 3 from the Berars. Re-admissions and discharges. There were 2 re-admissions into the Asylum (1 male from the Berars and 1 female from the Central Provinces). Four criminal lunatics (all from the Central Provinces), 2 males and 2 females, were discharged as under:11 STATEMENT V. The ages of the majority of the admissions were, as in 1894, between the ages of 20 and 40 years. One epileptic child, aged about 512 Mortality. There were in all 12 deaths during the year, viz:13 strength of lunatics during 1895 was 170.87 against a daily average of 161.20 in 1894, and the dieting expenses were consequently higher. The cost of grain, dâl, wheat and rice in 1895 was also higher than in the previous year. The amount paid into the Treasury for manufactured articles sold, and sale of vegetables and flowers and Asylum produce was Rs. 556-11-2 as compared with Rs. 121-14-6 in 1894 and Rs. 31-11-1 in 1893. The first item is made up by sale proceeds of14 unutilised Asylum made clothing " tât patti " and of the net money bags unsold was Rs. 37-10-0. An oil mill was purchased from the Central Jail at the close of the year, and a beginning has been made of oil pressing. At present linseed is pressed in the mill, but I wish to try the pressing of cotton seed also, as the oil derived from the seed is excellent for cooking and other purposes, and the refuse or marc left after extraction of the oil would be very good as food for the Dairy cattle. A hope was expressed in last year's report that we might in 1895 introduce the husking of " dhan ", not only as an occu- pation for the lunatics but also to effect some savings in dieting expenses. However, owing to the expense of bringing the " dhan " from other districts, the scheme was not found to be practicable. STATEMENT XII. The following table gives the average cost per lunatic under the various heads during the past 6 years :15 to increase at the ratio at which it has done during the past five years (the daily average in 1890 was 118.27 and in 1895, 170.87), I am of opinion that he should have the assistance of a young energetic Hospital Assistant to work under him, and who could be trained to Asylum work, which is quite distinct from ordinary dispensary work. In this connection, I may state that I have this year made a commencement of utilising the educational advantages and facilities which the Asylum affords, in arranging that all the young Hospital Assistants, who for a longer or shorter time are attached for duty at Nagpur, shall receive a short course of clinical and practical instruction in the care and management of cases of mental disease, which knowledge, I hope, will occa- sionally be of use to them in their subsequent career. S. M. Santio, the clerk and compounder, has also carried out all his duties to my entire satisfaction. He is punctual and regular in his habits, and the clerical work in the office, accounts, &c., have all considerably increased of late. The usual monthly meeting of visitors were held, and the half-yearly meetings on the 11th January and 16 th July 1895. The Asylum was inspected by the Chief Commissioner, Mr. Woodburn, on the 12th August and 26th November, the second visit being specially to inspect the Dairy and Farm; and by Mr. Lyall on the 30th December. Surgeon-Colonel Ross, Administrative Medical Officer, paid a visit of inspection on the 16th March, and Surgeon-Colonel Newman, Administrative Medical Officer, on the 4th April and 3rd August. G. F.

16 Report on the Jubbulpore Lunatic Asylum for the year 1895. There were no alterations or additions to the Asylum buildings during the year except the annual repairs done by the Public Works Department. The ground in front of the Asylum was brought under cultivation this year. Tilli and dhal were sown, the crop was not very goodowing to the scanty rainfall at the end of the year. Funds are not yet available for the building of accommodation of European and Eurasian patients. All buildings are in good order. STATEMENT I. This statement shows the total of all lunatics independent of classification. The total population of the year was a little lower than that of last year, being 174 (134 males, 40 females) against 180 (142 males, 38 females) in 1894. The number remaining on the 1st January 1895 was 149 (115 males, 34 females); admitted during the year 16 males 6 females, total 22, re-admitted 3 males. Total 134 males, 40 females=l74. Of these, 13 males were discharged " cured "; 2 males were discharged " otherwise "; 6 males and 5 females (total 11) died leaving a total of 113 males and 35 females. There were no escapes during the year. The 2 discharged "otherwise" were criminal lunatics sent to stand their trial, being declared by the official visitors capable of making their defence. The 3 re-admissions were 2 of the criminals sent to stand their trial and thereafter were sent back to the Asylum, and one was a man who escaped in 1893 and voluntarily returned. The percentage of deaths to daily average strength was 7.48 (males 5.29, females 14.83) against 9.90 (males 11.10, females 6.06) in 1894, and to admissions 44.00 (males 31.58 females 83.33) against 50.00 (males 50.00, females 50.00) in 1894. Of the 13 males discharged " cured ", 4 were criminal lunatics. One had been in the Asylum for 15 years, another 12 years. Another criminal's sentence had expired and he was declared sane by the visitors. The fourth was declared capable of making his defence and was sent back to his district to stand his trial, and has not returned. The average residence of the 9 non-criminals was 1 year and 3 months, the highest being 3 years, and the lowest being 6 months. With reference to the correspondence regarding the difference between the number of cases cured in this Asylum compared with that of other Provinces, I have divided the inmates of the Asylum at the end of the year as follows:17 the word " unknown", and as the man often cannot or will not talk it is rather difficult to give a previous history or much beyond the present symptoms. Then again, as to the probable cause of insanity, beyond what the police or the village kotwar can say, there is little else to go on and it is only where the lunatic has recovered sufficiently that anything can be said, and even then it cannot be trustworthy. If asked if he has ever smoked ganja, the general reply is " Yes ", and it is probably correct, for the majority of the lower class in these Provinces occasionally smoke, and one is very liable for the want of any other cause to say that ganja is the cause. STATEMENT II. The 33 criminal lunatics remaining on the 1st January 1895 were classified thus:18 Religion and sex19 Raipur, and at the end of 10 months' service he was sent to escort a prisoner to Saugor on his return. He thought he would like to pay his respects to the Deputy Superintendent of the Asylum, and on doing so he was apprehended. The Chief Commissioner was communicated with, and he was ordered to be discharged. The man admits having smoked ganja, and I do not see any reason for disbelieving him. The man is now perfectly sane, but I have no doubt that the slightest exciting cause will reproduce it, be it drink, love or anger. STATEMENT VII. Alleged causes of insanity. Of the 25 admissions, 4 (2 criminals and 2 non-criminals) are entered as ganja smokers, but 1 hesitate to place three of them under the head of toxic insanity as their insanity has lasted too long, my idea being that the effects of ganja produce only a tem- porary mania (toxic insanity) 1 puerperal, 1 fever, 2 epilepsy, 6 for hereditary and congenital, 1 religious mania, 5 from grief, 6 unknown. Of these unknown, some cause may in future be discovered. STATEMENT VIII. This shows the sickness and mortality for the whole Asylum and not for the admissions only. The admissions into hospital were 82 males and 21 females, total 103, against 111 males and 11 females, total 122, in 1894. There were 55 admissions from fever, bowel complaints 7 and respiratory affections 10, debility 3, and 2 for small- pox. Of the two cases of small-pox, the first case was that of a girl deaf, dumb and blind; she had not, as far as we could discover, moved from the corner of a barrack. She had had confluent small-pox before and was deeply pitted. She was attacked with confluent small-pox on the 23rd March. She had been also vaccinated. She was removed to a room outside the female asylum enclosures into one of the female warders' quarters. She recovered. How she could have received the contagion I could not find out. It was utterly impossible for her to have come into contact with any individual except the female keepers and sweepers; the children of these people were examined and found clean. All precautions were taken to prevent the spread of the disease. The other was a very mild attack, and occurred on the 29th March 1895, He had been working in the garden, and as there was a good deal of small-pox in the city, it is quite possible that he could have contracted the disease from the rubbish used as manure. He is not likely to have contracted it by associating with outsiders. He had been successfully vaccinated. Local Injuries.20 but the fits could not be reduced below one an hour. On the 6th October he had a very severe attack at 1-30 P. M. which continued till 7-30 P. M., when he died. He was admitted into the Asylum in October 1889 from amentia, and had had no fit until September 1895.

ANNUAL REPORT ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES FOR THE YEAR 1896. BY Surgn.-Col. G. HUTCHESON, M.D., Administrative Medicial Officer, C.P. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Allahabad : PRINTED AT THE PIONEER PRESS. 1897.
No. 4640. Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner, Central Provinces, in the General Department,2 admissions to hospital fell from 126 to 50 and of deaths from 12 to 7, the diminution being due to the comparative absence of influenza and fever. The health statistics compare very favourably with those of Asylums in other parts of India, and this is the more satisfactory that the cost, especially in the matters of diet and clothing, is considerably smaller and has of late years been steadily reduced, although this year high prices have caused a rise in Jubbulpore. In Nagpur the dairy has given excellent results both financially and in regard to the health of the inmates, and Surgeon-Major Harris is to be congratulated on its success. The question of further payments by lunatics for their maintenance, referred to in paragraph 31 of the Report, is under the Chief Commissioner's consideration. 5. The management of both Asylums has continued conspicuously good throughout the year and reflects the greatest credit on both the Superintendents. Both the Deputy Superintendents have also done good work, and the bestowal of the title of Rai Sahib on Hospital Assistant Mohan Lal of the Jubbulpore Asylum was a well-deserved honour which the Chief Commissioner had much pleasure in transmitting to him. ORDER.ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES FOR THE YEAR 1896. THIS Report and its Appendices were sent to the Press on the 10th February 1897, which is the date prescribed for their submission by the Chief Commis- sioner, Central Provinces. 2. Officers in charge.( 2 ) 7. Jubbulpore Asylum. Twenty-one patients were discharged during the year, 17 males and 4 females. Of these, 19 were cured, 1 was discharged improv- ed and 1 male escaped and is still at large. 8. The daily average strength at Nagpur was 177.83, or an increase of 6.96, while at Jubbulpore the average was 154.10, or an increase of 7.02 on the previous year. 9. The percentage of cured to the daily average strength was greater in the Jubbulpore than in Nagpur Asylum. Daily average strength. Percentage cured. Nagpur Aslyum ... ... 177.83 3.37 Jubbulpore ( 3 ) 13. The percentage of cured to daily average strength closely approxi- mates to last year's figure, and these percentages are persistently much lower than those recorded in the Asylums of other Provinces. 14. No useful comparison can be drawn from the figures in the above table ; for the number cured varies according to the type of insanity from which those admitted suffer, and the chief causes of temporary insanity may not be so pro- nounced in one Province as in another. 15. Although no very definite reason can be assigned, the low percentage of cures in the Asylums of these Provinces is doubtless due to the causes stated, and in some measure to a closer system of recording cures which may be more apparent than real.

The increase in the cost of diet sufficiently explains the increase in the cost of maintenance at Jubbulpore. 35. The daily average strength of the inmates, employed-on manufactures and in the garden, is shewn thus:( 9 ) Report on the Nagpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1896. STATEMENT No. I. Admissions and Discharges.( 10 ) Twelve criminal lunatics (eleven males and one female) were discharged dur- ing the year (nine from the Central Provinces and three from Berar) as under :( 11 ) STATEMENT No. IV. As usual, the labouring classes furnished the largest number of admissions (8) during 1896, the males and females being equal; 6 of those admitted came from the cultivator class : beggars and servants giving 3 each. It will be curious to observe whether the scarcity in some districts during the latter months of the year just ended will produce any notable increase in the admissions during the ensuing year into the Asylum. STATEMENT No. V. Ages of admission. The ages of the majority of the admissions were, as in the previous year, between the ages of 20 and 40 years. STATEMENT No. VI. Types of Insanity. In the subjoined tabular statement the various types of insanity found to exist amongst the new admissions is summarised:( 12 ) the cause of the insanity, there is very little evidence forthcoming to substantiate this statement, and it is also stated that the man was an epileptic. In the case of criminal lunatic Dhaja Ram from Sambalpur, it is noted in the statement sent with the lunatic that " Malaria may be the cause according to his own statement" and the duration of insanity is said to have been four months. The crime committed was setting fire to his own house. There is absolutely nothing to confirm the suggestion that malaria was the cause of the insanity. He had no fever whilst at Sambalpur and he has had no fever since his admission to the Asylum. He escaped shortly after his admission but was re-captured, and he is now practically quite sane, and all he can say is that he had fever and does not know what he did or why he set fire to his house. Of the two cases in which a moral cause is alleged( 13 ) STATEMENTS Nos. IX AND XI. The total amount received from the Treasury was Rs.10,166-3-10 against Rs.10,103-4-7 drawn in 1895. The value of unconsumed grain at the close of the year was Rs.772-4-2. The amount received from the paying patients was Rs.3,058-8-8 ; Rs.2,610 adjusted by the Comptroller, Central Provinces, for an average of 29 Berar lunatics at Rs.90 a head, and Rs.448-8-8 actual cash receipt from paying patients. The following items are shewn in column 4:( 14 ) One cow and one buffalo calf died during the year, and the live stock on the Farm at the close of the year consisted of( 15 ) of a large dairy should be divorced, as he cannot do full justice to both. On the 8th December, the Asylum Dairy was minutely inspected by the Director- General of the Indian Medical Service, Doctor James Cleghorn, and a minute recorded that "the small sickness and mortality during the year up to date may in part be ascribed to the large supply of skimmed milk which is supplied daily from the dairy. The good effects of skimmed milk on the health of luna- tics has also been observed in the Asylum at Bareilly, North-Western Provinces.'' The net profit during the year amounted to Rs.4,650-3-3 as compared with Rs.1,358-10-1 in 1895, Rs.749-9-2 in 1894, and Rs.531-8-2 in 1893. The value of clothing made in the Aslyum was Rs.79-14. This is consider- ably less than last year, and is due to the fact that the Asylum cotton crop failed during the year. The value of goods in stock unsold at the close of the year (chiefly cotton money bags, tat-patti, &c.) was Rs.27-8-0. In last year's report it was noted that we were going to try and start the pressing of cotton seed oil in the Asylum. I regret to report that the experiment proved a failure. During the year 10 maunds and 9 seers of linseed oil was pressed in the Asylum and utilized for cooking, &c. The establishment of a second oil pressing machine is con- templated at an early date. When this is done we shall not require to purchase any linseed oil for the Asylum or oil-cake for the Farm. STATEMENT No. XII.

The charge per head for medicines is slightly higher than in the pre- vious year and is due to the fact that some very necessary instruments were supplied during the year such as a post-mortem case, hydrocele apparatus and a hypodermic syringe. Statement X requires no comment. Additions and improve- ments. A cattle-shed was erected by the Public Works Department at the south east corner of the Asylum Ward. This was much need- ed. Two of the old godowns attached to the east bunga- low were also altered and converted into dairy buildings during the year. An additional pump was placed in the well behind the old Judicial Commissioner's Kutcherry (now used as one of the Asylum Wards) and the water conveyed to the large reservoir. The additional supply of water thus obtained will much increase the area of land which can be irrigated and add to the vegetable supply. A water pipe with a large iron trough has also been supplied for the use of the cattle. The bolts of the doors of the 8 cells in which noisy and refractory male lunatics are kept have been altered and made more secure, the plan used in the Central Jail having been adopted. The padlocks now cannot be reached by those in the cells. More cell accommodation is needed, but for the present financial considerations stand in the way of their being provided. The usual annual repairs, white-washing, &c., have been carried out. A new vegetable garden has been made outside the railed enclosure, where the soil is good and a well with an abun- dant supply of water close by. Surgeon-Major G. F. A. Harris held charge throughout the year. First Class Civil Hospital Assistant Abdul Majid Khan has held the office of Deputy Superintendent throughout the year. I have elsewhere adverted to his excellent work in connection with the Dairy, and I have only to add that he has also performed his Asylum duties to my complete satisfaction. I must again urge the necessity of his having a young and capable Hospital Assistant as an assistant in the Asylum work. Clinical demonstrations on the Asylum cases and elementary instruction in lunacy was also given as in former years to all young Hospital Assistants attached for duty to Nagpur. The usual monthly meetings of visitors were held and the half-yearly meetings on the 20th January and 17th July, 1896. The Asylum buildings, &c., were inspected by the Chief Commis- sioner, Mr. Lyall, on the 9th September, and by Surgeon-Major-General J. Cleghorn, M. D., the Director-General of the Indian Medical Service, on the 8th December. It was also frequently visited by the Administrative Medical Officer, Central Provinces. G. F. A. HARRIS, M R.C.P.

( 17 ) Report on the Jubbulpore Lunatic Asylum for the year 1896. THERE were no additions or alterations made in the Asylum buildings dur- ing the year, except the annual repairs carried out by the Public Works Depart- ment. STATEMENT I Shews the admissions and results of the past 11 years. Remaining at the beginning of the year 148 (males 113, females 35) ; admitted during the year 28 (males 24, females 4) and 1 male re-admitted, total 177 (males 138, females 39) ; discharged cured 19 (males 16, females 3) ; improved 1 female, a non-criminal lunatic; 1 discharged otherwise, escaped. Died 11 (males 7, females 4) ; remaining at the end of the year 145 (males 114, females 31) against 148 at the end of 1895. The largest number confined on any one night, was 161 (males 125, females 36). As the capacity of the Asylum is for 163 at 54 superficial feet per inmate there was no overcrowding. The daily average strength was 154.10 against 147.08 of the preceding year and the daily average sick 4.15 against 4.46. Percentage to daily average strength cured 12.33 against 8.84; died 7.13 against 7.48. Percentage to admission cured 65.52 against 52.00 ; died 37.93 against 44.00. STATEMENT II Deals with criminal lunatics. At the beginning of the year there were 31 (males 28, females 3), classified as follows :( 18 ) than a lunatic. During the time he was at large, up to 29th July, 1896, he had travelled over Indore, Bhusawal, Khandwa, Bombay, Bhavnagar, Dholia, &c., subsisting on begging; he eventually reached the Hindu shrine " Dwarkaji," where he had the sacred mark of Dwarka stamped on both shoulders. On the 30th July he came to the Asylum to pay his respects to the Deputy Superintendent and was detained. Of the 9 admissions (3 committed murder,) 8 were received from the Central Provinces, 1 came from Native States. (1) Thakurdin, Kole, age 50, resident of Sehora Tahsil, murdered his wife whilst she was in bed. Pronounced unfit to stand his trial by the Civil Surgeon. The exciting cause in this case was excessive ganja-smoking. History.( 19 ) Ram Otar, a sepoy in a Bombay regiment, was discharged as medically unfit and sent to his house. On arrival at Munmar Railway Station, he was robbed of everything, and had to walk to Saugor; had great difficulty in obtaining food, and at Saugor he thought the best thing to do was to go to the Regimental Surgeon and state his case. The servants refused to allow him to see the saheb, so he thought the only way to get into his presence was to pretend to steal something. He picked up some clothes which the dhobi had laid out to dry, but instead of being taken to the house, the police were sent for. He became very violent and was accused of insanity. On arrival at the Asylum, two months after he was perfectly sane. He has been sent back to Saugor to stand his trial, and I daresay has been released. Mahadeo, 26, Kori, inhabitant of Rewah State, a thin, miserable little man, admitted into the Central Jail, very emaciated and suffering from incipient phthisis. In the jail hospital he suddenly developed acute mania : destroyed his cloth- ing ; broke all the windows of his cell; very dirty. When spoken to would look at you in the vacant sort of way. Would sit in the window's chowkut and grin at the other patients, and occasionally break out into fits of violence. The fit lasted ten days. On admission into the Asylum he was apparently sane, and says his insanity was the will of God; had never been like that before. He is not to be trusted, and has to be carefully watched. Mussammat Sursuti, 26, a miserable, emaciated woman, accused of stealing a dhoti which she saw hanging to a tree in the roadside ; there were several people close by, and she did not attempt to runaway. She thinks a long time before answering, and her answers are not always to the point. Is gradually improving physically and mentally. Dhanai, an emaciated boy of 17 or 18, caught stealing some cooked food from a house; was severely beaten and ran away from his village. Wandered about the country and was found concealed in a house. " He takes a long time in answering questions and seems intellectually defi- cient." On arrival at the Asylum he was apparently sane. Manuk, a hopeless case of dementia, very old and feeble. Mohun Lall, a case of acute mania. Cause at present unknown. Of the five discharged and transferred, two were returned to their district to stand their trial, being declared sane. Two transferred to non-criminal list after the expiry of sentence being pronounced unfit for discharge; one escaped. This is a very common case. He has escaped twice and attempted to do so many times, and I have great doubts if he has ever been insane. He was sentenced by the Deputy Commissioner, Chhindwara, for attacking a constable, and whilst in jail killed a warder, and being declared insane was sent to the Asylum. It is stated that he is a confirmed ganja-smoker and is very morose in his disposition. He was kept in a cell. His past escape was scarcely that of a lunatic. He stated that he was ill at 7 P.M., and was given medicine; he then col- lected the dry earth of his cell and arranged it so, that when a blanket was placed over it, it looked like a man sleeping. At 10 P.M., the warders came their rounds and called to Omrao to give him his medicine, and. receiving no answer and seeing no movement under the blanket, they unlocked the door and went in. Omrao was standing in the corner and he suddenly dashed the lamp out of the warder's hand and ran out. He made straight to his home in Chhindwara and was re- captured. A short time after he was found with his head through the roof, having taken off the tiles. He had made rope of his clothing and blanket. Another time he nearly escaped by rubbing one of the chain links against the wall. When discovered the link was just cut through.
( 20 ) Another time he made a large hole in the wall. The last time he managed to cut through a bar. On this night he was hand- cuffed to the door of his cell. In the morning the handcuffs were lying open and the bar of the window opposite cut through. Nothing has been heard since of him. I would mention here that with reference to the review of the Chief Commis- sioner on last year's Lunatic Asylum Reports regarding the order contained in para. 4, a full report, together with the remarks of the visitors regarding each cri- minal lunatic was submitted to the Administrative Medical Officer on the 26th October, for the information of the Local Administration. STATEMENT III Shews religion, sex, and district of all lunatics admitted during the year. Of the 29 admissions and re-admissions, 22 are Hindus, 5 Musalmans and 2 other castes. Of the whole, 14 came from Jubbulpore District, 6 Saugor, 4 Mandla, 2 Narsinghpur, 1 Hoshangabad and 2 from Native States and Central India. STATEMENT IV Deals with occupation. Half of the admissions comprise farm labourers, cultivators, Malguzars, Kotwar and Patwari. STATEMENT V Shews the different ages of the admissions( 21 ) Exciting Cause( 22 ) 5.

( 26 ) It will be seen that there is an increase of Rs.200-10-0, which is chiefly due to the clerk receiving full pay and the compounder half pay, the other half being paid by the Reformatory, the latter institute having previously paid the whole ; but calculating the cost per head per annum, there is the very slight increase of Rs.0-1-2 per head. There was an increase of Rs.2-11-8 per head for diet, which is due to the high prices of food-grains (wheat, gram and dall).

No. 3897. Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner, Central Provinces, in the General Department, dated Nagpur, the 30th May 1898. READ2 6. The management of both asylums has continued good throughout the year, and reflects great credit on both the Superintendents. In Nagpur the dairy has continued to give excellent results both financially and in regard to the health of the inmates, and Surgeon-Major Harris is to be congratulated on the results. Both the Deputy Superintendents have also done good work throughout the year. ORDER.ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES FOR THE YEAR 1897. THIS Report is due in the Secretariat on 10th February, and was sent to Press on that date. 2. Officers in charge.( 2 ) 7.

Occupation, &c., of those admitted.( 5 ) 21. Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel McKay records the particulars of cases in which the alleged cause of insanity was privation, and the want of proper sustenance. STATEMENT VIII. 22. Sickness.( 6 ) 26. The various causes of death in the Asylums are specified in the follow- ing table : ( 7 ) Owing to an irregular system of adjusting the accounts under this head, the accounts of different years cannot be compared. A sum of Rs.878-9-5, in connec- tion with paying patients in the Jubbulpore Asylum, remained unadjusted at the close of the year. 30. In the amount shown against Nagpur are included Rs.2,610 adjusted inter-departmentally by the Comptroller, Central Provinces, on account of the main- tenance of 29 Berar lunatics, and Rs.385-3-3 are actual cash receipts from paying patients. A sum of Rs.4,275-10-4 is shown under the head "miscellaneous receipts " in Nagpur Asylum accounts, and is made up of items as follows:( 8 ) 34. The mean cost per head, of the inmates of the Asylums in the Central Provinces, is compared with the mean cost in other Provinces in the following table :( 9 ) Annual Report of the Nagpur Lunatic Asylum for 1897. STATEMENT No. I. Admissions and Discharges.( 10 ) Thirteen criminal lunatics (12 males and 1 female) were discharged during the year. Only one of these (a male) came from Berar :( 11 ) be traced. No notable increase was specially traced to scarcity or want amongst the admissions, and there were no admissions from two at least of the districts in which scarcity had been very noticeable, viz., Balaghat and Bhandara. Ages of admissions. STATEMENT No. V. The ages of the majority of those admitted were found, as in all previous years, to be between 20 and 40 years. Types of Insanity. STATEMENT No. VI. In the subjoined tabular statement the various types of insanity found to exist amongst the new admissions is summarised:( 12 ) STATEMENT VIII. The year, on the whole, was very healthy. There were 59 admissions compared with 50 in the previous year to hospital during 1897, viz :( 13 ) The juari grown on the Asylum farm was sold to the Poor-house authorities, at Bagargunge, at rates slightly lower than the Bazaar rates then current. The total receipts from all sources amounted to Rs.22,913-6-4, as compared with Rs.19,272-7-9 in 1896. The total expenditure, in 1897, amounted to Rs.22,303-14-5, as compared with Rs.16,934-12-6 in 1896. The expenditure on the Dairy during the year amounted to Rs.2,986-10-5 which includes Rs.479 expended on the purchase of new live-stock and Rs.431 the cost of an Alexandra Separator, a Victoria Churn and some dry fodder which was stored. At the close of the year 1897, the live-stock in the Farm consisted of a breeding bull, 12 pairs of draught-bullocks, 30 cows, 10 buffaloes, 5 buffalo- calves, 25 heifers and 21 cow-calves, or a total of 115 animals, valued at Rs.2,264. During 1897, the following additions were made to the Farm : ( 14 ) The net profit at the Asylum during the past five years has been as under: ( 15 ) Report on the Jubbulpore Lunatic Asylum for the year 1897. Additions and Alterations in the buildings. A large well, situated on the ground newly acquired, has been covered in with iron girders and stone slabs. No other additions or alterations. The usual annual repairs were carried out by the Public Works Department. The new works which are under contempla- tion at present are :( 16 ) Six criminal lunatics (5 males, 1 female) were discharged and transferred as under: 2 males were sent to stand their trial; 2 (1 male and 1 female) whose sen- tences expired and were taken on Non-Criminal list and 2 were discharged by order of the Local Government, 3 males died. The following gives the particulars of the class of lunatics in the Asylum at the close of the year : ( 17 ) and strangled his brother's child. He acknowledges that he did it, but he does not seem to realize that he has done anything wrong. The case was sent from Neemuch Cantonment, Central India. The daily average being 35.44 (males 32.03, females 3.41) against 34.28 (males 31.23, females 3.05) in the year preceding. STATEMENT No. III. There is little calling for remarks under this statement. Of the 32 admis- sions, 21 were Hindus, 7 Mahomedans and 4 other castes. Of the whole, 8 were from Jubbulpore district, including 1 from Central Jail, 4 from Seoni, 2 Saugor, 3 Hoshangabad, 1 Mandla, 1 Nimar, and 3 from Central Indian Agency (1 Neemuch Cantonment and 2 Sehore, Bhopal State), STATEMENT No. IV. Deals with previous occupations and does not call for any remarks, except a student, who is a respectable and highly educated man, and who has passed his B.A. Examination after hard study, and whose predisposing cause was grief brought on by loss of brother and mother, and also his father's present troubles. He is now nearly quite well and will soon be discharged. STATEMENT No. V. Does not call for any further comment, as it explains itself. Ages. Male. Female. Total. Under 20 ... 6 ... 6 Between 20 & 40 ... 20 4 24 Do. 40 & 60 ... ... 1 1 Over 60 ... 1 ... 1 27 5 32 The majority apparently become insane between 20 and 40, which I have al- ready explained in my previous reports. STATEMENT No. VI. This statement has been revised. The type of insanity has been changed by Government of India, Home Department No 2 Medical / 52, dated 28th January 1897, according to the new classification of the nomenclature of diseases for 1896. This statement shows the different types of insanity. The old cases have been classified according to the method prescribed in the circular. The admissions during the year will only be reviewed. Of the 32 admissions, the following classification has been made:( 18 ) With reference to the class " declared to have recovered." This is the case of Jugdeo, resident of zila Jounpore, who had been a servant for a few days of the notorious poisoner, who is now in the Central Jail, Jubbulpore. He was apparently sane when he came to the Asylum, and he states that his master gave him some sweets to eat ; after eating, he became unconscious and found himself in the hands of the police, for having entered someone's house. He was sent to the Victoria Hospital, where the stomach-pump was used. He was sent to the Asylum under observation, and discharged sane after the period of observa- tion. This was no doubt a case of poisoning. Possibly it was an experiment on the part of the master to see the effect of the drug. STATEMENT No. VII. Alleged cause of insanity of the 32 admissions, 4 (2 criminal, 2 non-criminal) were entered as ganja-smoking, 1 other intoxicant (who has declared to have recovered), one hereditary, and 13 other physical causes, 3 religious impression, grief and domestic troubles. The total causes( 19 ) STATEMENT No. VIII. This shows the sickness and mortality. There were 108 admissions to hos- pital, and 13 deaths, against 109 and 11 respectively in 1896. Compared as follows :( 20 ) 6, Abscess 9, Ulcers 6, Scabies 5, Debility and Old age 4, Dropsy and Albuminuria 3, Rheumatism 3, and Dysentery 1, &c. The daily average number of sick was 5.16 against 4.15 in 1896. Mortality: 13 against 11 in 1896 :( 21 ) No local or general injury during the year. STATEMENT No. IX. Is the cash account. The receipts from the Treasury amounted to Rs. 9,907-15-3 against Rs.8,663-0-9 in the year preceding, or an increase of Rs.1,244-14-6. This is accounted for by grain compensation allowance drawn for Asylum establishment during the year 1897 showing Rs.188-8-0 more than in 1896. An increase of Rs.975-10-5 for rations owing to dearness of staple food-grains and Rs.93-12-3 more on account of raw material for manufacturing purposes ; but this has been recouped to the Asylum as Rs.188-12-6 worth of manufactured goods was credited beyond last year. Receipts from paying patients, Rs. 1,797-7-3 against Rs.2,368-4-0, The amount owed by paying patients by the Central Provinces and Native States and from Cen- tral Indian Agency for the half-year ending 31st December 1897 was Rs.878-9-5. This could not have been realised before the end of the year. Really column 3 should be Rs.2,676-1-8, an increase over that of last year. Rs.307-13-8, I am glad to see, that the Local Government have sanctioned my recommendation of last year regarding the obtaining what we can, for maintenance. Column 4 represents the total receipts of stores from Manufacturing Department of the Asylum Rs. 1,223-8-6, minus the cost of raw materials, against Rs. 1,003-12-0 in 1896. Column 5 shows the Book receipts, Rs.460-8-7 (viz., Public Works charges Rs.437-6-10 and cost of English medicines Rs.23-1-9) against Rs.384-13-5. The increase is due to Public Works charges. Column 6 shows the money paid into the Treasury on account of the sale- proceeds of manufactured articles, Rs.457-1-3 against Rs.394-5-0 in 1896. Columns 8, 9,10, and 11 show actual expenditure of the Asylum for the year, including items inter-departmentally supplied from the Asylum manufactory and Asylum garden. Column 13 includes as follows, Rs.695-9-6, viz:( 22 ) STATEMENT XI Deals with manufactures, and is practically the same in detail as in previous years. The net profit or excess of credits amounted to Rs. 1,201-1-9 against Rs.1,012-5-3 for the year preceding, being an increase of Rs.188-12-6 on manufac- tured articles, the value of articles Rs. 1,223-8-6 supplied to the Asylum against Rs.1,003-12-0 in 1896. The daily average number of patients employed in the Manufactory and Garden was 65.15 against 62.98 in 1896. This does not include those on usual domestic employment, such as tailoring, cooking, &c.

The difference was due to the high prices of food-grains which prevailed in 1897, and to the payment of compensation to establishments for dearness of grain. 34. The net profit from manufactures amounted, at the Nagpur Asylum, to Rs.6,054-0-7 as compared with Rs.6,278-3-0 in the previous year ; and at the Jubbulpore Asylum to Rs. 1,055-14-9 against Rs. 1,201-1-9. The difference is due to the cessation of the famine and the consequent fall in the demand for blankets, dosutees and other articles manufactured in the Asylums. 35. In the following table, the expenditure per inmate per annum under different heads is shown :( 9 ) 37. The daily average strength of the inmates employed on manufactures and in the garden is shown as follows:( 10 ) Annual Report on the Nagpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1898. STATEMENT I.

This deals with the types of insanity. The admissions during the year were classified as follows :( 13 ) 23. Brief notes on cases of insanity, attributed to physical causes, are sub- mitted as follows :( 14 ) (b) Miajan, Mahomedan, aged 30 years, formerly a patwari, admitted for mania. His brother has been in the Asylum for seven years, and his mother is insane, but living at her home. Fever. 28. The case in which fever is believed to have been the cause of insanity, was in the person of a Brahmin widow, named Ramdhei, aged about 26 years. This woman had been admitted into the Dufferin Hospital for fever. Whilst in the hospital, she suddenly developed symptoms of acute mania and was transferred to the Asylum. After a residence of 52 days in the Asylum, she recovered and became quite sane. The official visitors have ordered that she be made over to her friends. Pregnancy. 27. The case in which pregnancy is believed to have been the exciting cause of insanity, was in the person of a woman named Gan- goo, aged 35 years, who had been in the Asylum for about two months in 1894, and who was discharged after her confinement and made over to her friends. She was again admitted for mania on 29th May 1898. 28. The eight moral causes of insanity were:( 15 ) 34. The subjoined statement shows briefly the particulars of each case:( 16 ) (3) Peroo, aged 48 years, spent over 10 years and 4 months in the Asylum, suffering from chronic mania. In hospital for influenza from 27th May 1898 to 8th June 1898, seized with dysentery on 17th July 1898 and died on 6th August. (4) Abdul Rahim, aged 48 years, admitted three times into the Asylum, suffering from chronic mania, and spent over 7 years in it. Seldom spoke, frequently refused all food and had to be fed by force. Contracted dysentery on 2nd May 1898, and died on 12th June. (5) Vithoba, aged 47 years, over 7 years and 9 months in the Asylum, suffering from chronic mania. Health failing since October 1897. Seized with dysentery on 23rd February and died on 22nd March 1898. Debility. (1) Dattawrie, aged 58 years, over 23 years in the Asylum, suffering from chronic mania. Failing in health since 1896. Fed with great difficulty during the last year of his life. Died on 16th July 1898. (2) Pir Muhammad, aged 75 years, over 15 years and 4 months in the Asylum, suffering from chronic mania. Blind and helpless since the beginning of 1896. Died of old age on 4th November 1898. (3) Bhowar Singh, aged 37 years, over 10 years and 5 months in the Asylum, suffering from chronic dementia. Failing in health since 1895, when he had an attack of dysenteric diarrh( 17 ) 40. The column of miscellaneous receipts is made up as follows: ( 18 ) STATEMENT XII. 51. The following table shows the average cost per lunatic under the various heads during the past six years :( 19 ) Annual Report on the Jubbulpore Lunatic Asylum for the year 1898. In addition to the ordinary annual repairs carried out by the D. P. W., a boundary wall was built, running from the female yard to the west gate near the Omtee Bridge, at a cost of Rs.3,156-10-4. 2. It was suggested by the Administrative Medical Officer, on his visit to the Asylum in July 1898, that the old building known as the Thaggi Hospital and a piece of Nazul land adjoining, be obtained for the purpose of being converted into an Asylum for European and Eurasian insanes. An application to this effect has been made to the Chief Commissioner. STATEMENT I. 3. This statement shows the total number of lunatics in the Asylum, both criminal and non-criminal. The total population during the year was 182, against 177 in 1897. This was the highest number recorded during the past 11 years:( 20 ) On waking up in the morning of the 29th November, he talked sensibly, saying, he was quite ignorant of what went on at Patna, but had an idea that he had committed some great crime and had been locked up for it. Later in the day he again became excited. On December 5th, he became quiet and answered rationally and afterwards showed great improvement daily. On the 28th December, on the application of his friends, the official visitors recommended that he should be made over to them under the usual bond. In July 1893, he was again sent to the Asylum, in a wildly excited state and naked, and he refused food. It appears that he had gone to Mandla, and on return became again insane. There is no history of his having indulged in drink, but family troubles appear to have been the cause of the relapse. On the 28th August he was again made over to his friends. On the 10th February 1898, he was admitted a third time, was noisy, vio- lent, abusive, and had most exalted ideas of his own importance, saying at one time that he was a Raja, and at another, Ramchandra. The mania daily put on different forms ; one day he would occupy himself writing absurd petitions, another day he would spend in prayer, saying, he was the founder of the Hindu religion, another day he would be melancholic and beg of me to cut his throat with a knife. This went on until May, when he gradually became quiet, and in July he was again made over to his friends, having been rational since the end of May. The excit- ing cause of his insanity this time was over-study. He had been translating a Persian book in his leisure time, for he was still Professor of Persian. He was handed over to his uncle, who gave the usual bond, and being afraid that he would forfeit his bond if anything happened to his nephew, he used to lock him up in his house ; this so enraged the man that he again became very violent. I often saw him at his house and he would talk rationally and behave himself until the uncle put in an appearance, when he would become very violent and abusive. He still had an idea that he was a god. At the request of the uncle, he was again sent to the Asylum in November 1898, and since last admis- sion has been very violent. I am certain that it is the life in the Asylum that is making him violent. If any one but the uncle would take care of him and treat him kindly, I am sure he would recover; but I doubt it if he remains in the Asylum. His present state is not due to the Asylum treatment. STATEMENT. II. 9. This statement refers only to criminal lunatics. Remained on 1st January 1898( 21 ) There was thus a total of 40 (36 males and 4 females) criminal lunatics; of these, one was discharged "cured" by order of the Local Administration, and one died, 38 remaining at the close of the year, classified thus :( 22 ) (4) Bhurey Khan, age 25, charged under section 454, I. P.C., a most dis- reputable scoundrel. On admission, on the 8th September 1898, he was violent, laughed and sang all day long, was dirty in his habits, smeared himself over with excreta, was continually asking, " Where has she gone?" and threw excreta at the warders. A few days after, he became perfectly sane, and some time after, a ladder made of pieces of bamboo and ropes was found in his cell. He is now sane and fit to stand his trial, and confesses that he was in the habit of smoking ganja. (5) Gappoo, age 20, charged under section 379, I. P. C., another disreputable scoundrel and a friend of Bhurey Khan. On admission he had a vacant look and laughed without cause; thought he was a rich man and had lent lacs of rupees to several people ; would not continue one idea in conversation, was dirty, sleepless, and did not observe his caste rules. He attempted to escape with Bhurey Khan. States that he often drank ½ to ¾ of a bottle of liquor, and that one day he went to a Mela and smoked a pipe of ganja, and remembers nothing till he found himself in the Police lock-up. Is now quiet and fit to make his defence, but he will not do so. (6) Bihari, age 55, charged under section 379, I. P. C., a very sad case indeed. When admitted into the Asylum, his demeanour was most peculiar. When questioned, he wept and stood looking into vacancy with a most sad expression. He states that his wife first called him pagal, but gives a very incoherent account of why she did so, interjecting the fact that he is dying and that he has worked at white-washing, and that his brother has three children. States his wife has left him, the reason being that she is a woman and it is a woman's way. The cause is supposed to be grief on account of the sudden death of his young brother, to whom he was greatly attached. States he left his work because others used to abuse him, and that he then used to go to the jungle and collect wood and live on the sale of it. One day, he saw a stack of old bamboos, and he took a bundle intending to keep half the proceeds and pay into the Treasury the other half. (7) Achhargu, age 32, charged under section 302, I. P. C. This is a case of a good man gone wrong. He is a relation of the Dewan of the Garraoli State, in Central India, and used to ride and shoot well, but apparently he took to smoking ganja and used to beat his wife. The Dewan kept him under observa- tion for 15 months, when he had improved greatly, though of weak intellect. He allowed him to go back to his home. He met a man of the Danwa caste and obtained him employment in the Garraoli State. He lived in his village, and one day he heard rumours that the man was seen laughing and talking with his wife and daughter. They being purdah-nashins, it enraged him very much. " One day," he states, "when taking my food in the Thakur's house, the man came and sat opposite me, which annoyed me, and on my way home he continually teased me. One day, walking in the jungle with my rifle over my shoulder, I met the man again, and God and the devil put it into my head to kill him, and I ran my bayonet through him. I first thought of running away, but decided not to, and lay down in the field adjoining and was arrested by the State Police." When admitted into the Asylum, his demeanour and expression were those of a man not in his right mind. He smiled without cause and seemed to be continually lost in a train of thought entirely disassociated with his surroundings, and had a general appearance of melancholy. He was violent and dirty for a few days, but is now quiet and slightly melancholic. He now works in the cook-house. (8) Munna Chippa, age 28, charged under section 302, I. P. C.( 23 ) enceinte, but that he has no doubt about her character. Is improving mentally and physically, and I dare say that some more information will gradually be got from him. (9) Mussammat Bhury, charged under section 302, I. P. C.( 24 ) STATEMENT V. 13. The two females under 20 were non-criminals, and their histories are as follows:( 25 ) 17. In the case of the 5 unknown causes, the patients are at present not able to give any information, and nothing can be found out about them by the District Magistrate concerned. I have no doubt that in course of time (it may be a month or a year) something will be discovered. It is very interesting to watch for the first glimmer of sense and endeavour to strengthen it; and the anxiety on the part of the patient to remember, is sometimes distressing. STATEMENT VIII. 18. This statement shows the sickness and mortality for the whole Asylum. The admissions into hospital during the year were 100 (males 71, females 29), against 108 (males 89, females 19) in 1897. There were 7 deaths (males 4, females 3), against 13 (males 10, females 3) in 1897. 19. Diseases causing admission into hospital are compared below for the past two years :( 26 ) 22. The causes of death were:( 27 ) The total receipts from the Treasury were, Rs.8,356-9-6 against Rs.9,907-15-3 in 1897, showing a decrease of Rs. 1,551-5-9. The decrease was chiefly under the heads " Diet and Establishment." Rs. a. p.

The total receipts from paying patients were Rs.2,694-11-8 against Rs.1,797-7-3 in the preceding year. The amount Rs.878-9-5, which remained un- adjusted at the end of 1897, was recovered and credited during the year. Rupees 272-6-8 left unrealised will be recovered and credited in next year's account. Of this Rs.272-6-8, the sum of Rs 188-6-8 was received during the last week of December, but could not be credited into the Treasury, so that only Rs.84 remains to be recovered. 26. It may be explained, with reference to para. 28 of the Administrative Medical Officer's remarks on the report for the year 1897, that the irregularity is due to the amounts for maintenance charges from paying patients, due in the year, but paid into the Treasury in January following, having been credited in Decem- ber's accounts. 27. Column 4 represents the total receipts of stores from the Manufactory Department of the Asylum, minus the cost of raw material, and the amount was Rs.1,202-0-8 against Rs.1,223-8-6 in 1897. The decrease of Rs.21 was due to economy in petty items. 28. Column 5 shows book receipts Rs.3,324-1-0, namely, Public Works charges Rs.3,301-8-4 and cost of English medicines Rs 22-8-8. The increase over Rs.460-8-7 last year was due to the cost of constructing the wall mentioned under additions and repairs. 29. Column 6 shows the amounts remitted into the Treasury on account of the sale-proceeds of manufactured articles (Rs.441-2-1 against Rs.457-1-3 in 1897). The decrease was due to the cessation of the Famine and the non-demand for blankets, dosutee, khadi, newar, ropes and tat-putties. 30. Columns 8, 9, 10 and 11 show the actual expenditure of the Asylum for the year, including the items supplied inter-departmentally by the Asylum. 31. Column 13 includes items as follows:( 28 ) 33. Column 19, Public Works Department charges. There were no other book receipts or charges from other departments. STATEMENT X. 34. The sanctioned Establishment of the institution, as it stood on the 31st December 1898, requires no comment. STATEMENT XI 35. This statement deals with the manufactures.

The above table shows a decrease in expenditure of Rs.11-6-2 per head per annum, as compared with 1897, the principal decrease being under the heads "Diet," " Establishment" and "Clothing," which has already been explained in the remarks on Statement IX. 38.

With reference to para. 2 of the Chief Commissioner's Resolution on the report for the year 1897 and on the suggestion of the Administrative Medical Officer, Central Provinces, vide his No. 2943-358, dated 13th June 1898, it was decided that the two Superintendents should consult on cases reported " Cured " and decide on each case. The two cases reported last year were petty cases of theft and were pronounced by the official visitors as sane and fit to make their defence. They did not return, and so were considered cured. There have been no such cases this year in this Asylum, and only one in Nagpur. I was consulted by the Superin- tendent, who sent me a copy of the case-book, and we came to the conclusion that the man was cured. 42. The Asylum was visited by the Chief Commissioner and the Adminis- trative Medical Officer, and the official visitors held monthly meetings and record- ed their proceedings. 43. Lieutenant-Colonel H. K. McKay, I.M.S., C.I.E., held charge during the year. Rai Saheb Mohan Lall, the Deputy Superintendent, was as enthusiastic as ever. He has certainly a most friendly control over the inmates of the Asylum. I would strongly recommend him for some personal allowance. JUBBULPORE : H. K.

The percentage of deaths to strength and the percentage to total deaths from the chief causes of mortality in the Asylums of these Provinces are com- pared with the percentages in the Asylums of other Provinces in the following table :( 10 ) the previous year, an increase of Rs.26-0-7, due to the daily average strength being higher. 34. The amounts received from paying-patients during the past two years were as follows :( 11 ) 38. In the following table the expenditure per inmate per annum under different heads is shown :( 12 ) 41. Nagpur Dairy Farm.( 13 ) Annual Report on the Nagpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1899. STATEMENT I. Admissions and Discharges.( 14 ) 4. Seven of the lunatics "discharged cured" were non-criminal lunatics suffering from acute mania on admission, and the period of their residence in the Asylum varied from 4 months and 12 days, to 1 year 5 months and 18 days. 5. Two of the lunatics " discharged cured " had been confined in the Asylum under section 471, C. P. C. Both had been charged under section 436, I. P. C. and acquitted on the ground of insanity. The history of one of these lunatics, Ambi, aged 18 years, wife of Sharawan, is worth recording. This woman was caught in the act of setting fire to the house of a neighbour, charged under section 436, I. P. C., and acquitted on the ground of insanity. Major Buchanan, I.M.S., of the Central Jail, Nagpur, under whose observation she had been for some time, reports: " She makes " contradictory statements regarding her age and regarding the time she lived " with her husband; otherwise, I have observed no signs of insanity. The Assistant " Jailer states that she daily makes contradictory statements about her age, also " as to whether she burned the house. She cries without apparent reason. " Her mother and father state that she has been silly for some months." During the time she was in the Asylum, 9 months and 22 days, she was perfectly sane, stated that the house caught fire by accident and that she feigned insanity whilst under observation and during her trial and was tutored by the Police to say that she had set fire to the house. She was discharged by order of the Chief Commissioner, on the recommendation of the Official Visitors, on 3rd March 1899. 6. Two of the lunatics " discharged cured" were discharged by order of the Official Visitors and sent to stand their trial. Their histories are as follows :( 15 ) 9. There were 11 deaths during the year:( 16 ) (3) Udan, Brahmin, aged 35, a wandering beggar, admitted under section 466, C. P. C., crime section 122 of the Railway Act, IX of 1890. Captain Gray, I.M.S., under whose observation he had been for some time, reports : " Is wild and strange in manner. When spoken to, sometimes answers " fairly rationally in an abrupt jerky manner. At other times, pays no heed, but " gazes upwards in an abstracted manner and recites passages from his holy " books. States that he owns large numbers of elephants and horses in Oodey- " pore, and that his business is the buying and selling of the same. " Rubs himself over with mud and dirt. Digs up the floor of his cell." Shortly after admission he began to improve. Is now much improved and says that his insanity was caused by ganja which he had frequently smoked. (4) Banmali, aged 30, cultivator, admitted into the Asylum on 1st August 1899, under section 466, C. P. C., crime section 326, I. P. C. Father, mother, aunt and cousin said to be insane. On admission, was dejected and apathetic. Refused to answer questions or to eat any food, was very untidy and dirty in his person. In September he began to improve. Is now much improved and does a little work. (5) Sheikh Ibrahim, aged 22, Police constable, admitted on 28th August 1899, under section 466, C. P. C., crime section 392,I. P. C. (6) Pathaiya, aged 26, labourer, admitted on 28th August 1899, under section 466, C. P. C., crime section 392,I. P. C. These two men (Shaik Ibrahim and Pathaiya) were in the habit of smoking ganja together. One day, they smoked to such an extent that they were seized with acute mania and committed an offence under section 392,I. P. C. When brought up for trial, they were found to be of unsound mind and incapable of making their defence. Since admission to the Asylum, their mental condition has only improved very slightly. (7) Bhagwan Kulla, aged 26, cultivator, admitted to the Asylum on 7th February 1899, under section 466, C. P. C, crime section 379,I. P. C. His history has been given above, in connection with the remarks on State- ment I. (8) Khandu Hulbi, 23 years, weaver, admitted into the Asylum on 26th November 1899, under section 466, C. P. C. Murdered his wife, when she was asleep, by smashing her head with a mill- stone weighing 42lbs. Charged under section 302,I. P. C., but found of unsound mind and incapable of making his defence. Reported to be subject to fits of insanity since early childhoo d. The exciting cause of his present attack is attributed to his wife's " determination to produce an abortion and her unwillingness to bear him a child." Dr. Montgomery, Civil Surgeon of Basim District, who had him under ob- servation for a month previous to his admission to the Asylum, reports as follows :( 17 ) 12. The following statement gives the particulars of the different kinds of criminal lunatics in the Asylum at the close of the year:( 18 ) STATEMENT VI. 18. This deals with the types of insanity. The admissions during the year were classified as follows:( 19 ) STATEMENT VIII. 23. This statement shows the sickness and mortality during the year. There were 69 admissions into hospital and 11 deaths, against 205 and 17, respectively, in 1898. 24. The daily average number of sick was seven males and one female, total eight, against 5.74 males and 0.99 females, total 6.73, in 1898. The increase in the daily average number of sick, as compared with the previous year, is due to the fact that several of the infirm and epileptic inmates were kept in hospital during the greater part of the year, so that they might be under more immediate observation and receive special care and treatment. 25. The chief causes of admissions to hospital were debility 18; ague 10 ; dysentery 6 and abscess 6. 26. Local injuries, all of a trivial nature, accounted for 4 admissions. Three of these (2 cases of scalp wounds and 1 case of wound of the finger) were caused by the lunatics quarrelling amongst themselves, and one (a wound of the foot) was caused by juari stubble whilst the patient was working on the farm. 27. The following statement compares the admissions to hospital for the past two years :( 20 ) 28. During the year under report, only 1 case of influenza occurred, as compared with 129 cases in the previous year, and there were only 11 admissions from malarial fever, as compared with 28 in the previous year. The lesser prevalence of malarial fever was due, in all probability, to the very scanty rainfall of the year (in all 22.09 inches). No fever prophylactics were issued. 29. The deaths occurred from the following causes:( 21 ) 33. The amount received from paying-patients was Rs.2,509, which includes a sum of Rs.2,025 adjusted by the Comptroller, Central Provinces, for 27 Berar lunatics, at Rs.75 per head. 34. The actual cash receipts from paying-patients during the year amounted to Rs.484, against Rs.551-9-1 in 1898. 35. Column 4 includes the following items :( 22 ) 40. The total expenditure amounted to Rs.22,048-11-0, as compared with Rs.21,738-1-8 in 1898. 41. The expenditure on the Dairy Farm during the year amounted to Rs.4,164-7-2, as compared with Rs.2,032-12-1 in 1898. The increase was due to the necessity of purchasing fodder to the value of Rs.2,459. In 1898, only Rs.198 was expended on fodder. Owing to the very scanty rainfall (viz., 22.09 inches) during the year under report, almost all the crops sown on the farm were a failure, and there was little or no grass for the cattle. 42. The actual cash sales of Dairy produce amounted to Rs.3,387-11-8, but as the expenditure on the Dairy Farm was Rs.4,164-7-2, there was a cash loss on the year's transactions of Rs. 776-11-6. 43. During the year, milk to the value of Rs.800-9-10 was supplied from the Dairy Farm, to the Asylum inmates. Credit must be taken for this as well as for the cow-dung used in the Asylum as fuel and manure to the value of Rs.91-2-8. 44. The following additions were made to the live-stock during the year :( 23 ) STATEMENT XI. 47. Deals with manufactures. The net profit, or excess of credits, amounted to Rs.5,800-0-4, as against Rs.6,054-0-7 in the preceding year. The decrease was due to the fact that out- standing bills to the amount of Rs.245 which were due to the Asylum, were not collected before the close of the year. 48. The net profit at the Asylum during the past six years has been as follows:( 24 ) 53. The Deputy Superintendent, Khan Sahib Abdul Majid Khan, worked throughout the year with his usual zeal. 54. The Asylum was inspected by the Administrative Medical Officer on the 3rd June 1899, and by the Chief Commissioner, Mr. Fraser, on the 27th Decem- ber 1899. It was frequently visited on other occasions also by the Administrative Medical Officer. A.SILCOCK, M.D., Ph .D., MAJOR, I.M.S., Superintendent, Lunatic Asylum. NAGPUR : 24th January 1900.
( 25 ) Annual Report on the Jubbulpore Lunatic Asylum for the year 1899. Additions and Alterations.( 26 ) The keeper who took her to the latrine, sat outside waiting for her, and on her not putting in an appearance, she went in and found Musammat Nunhi had gone out of the other door and had escaped. There is no doubt she will turn up at her home, and intimation has been sent to the Deputy Commissioner of the District. The female keepers have been punished for their negligence and acting contrary to strict orders in this case. It was known she would endeavour to escape and strict orders had been given to prevent it. 7. Deaths 3 against 7. One of these deaths was a case of homicide; the details of these deaths will be given in the remarks on Statement VIII. 8. The year closed with 161 (125 males, 36 females) remaining in the Asylum, against 154 (118 males, 36 females) in the preceding year. 9. The daily average strength was 155.02 (118.62 males, 36.40 females), against 152.89 (116.53 males and 36.36 females) in 1898. Daily average sick 4.07 against 5.48. The percentage of cured to daily average strength was nearly the same as that of last year, viz., 12.90 against 13.09. The percentage cured to admission was 60.61 against 57.14. The percentage of deaths to strength was 1.94 against 4.59, and to admis- sions 9.09 against 20.00 of the previous year. 10. The maximum number confined on any one day was 167 (129 males and 38 females). The capacity of the Asylum, including cells and hospitals, is 163 (125 males and 38 females) so that there was no overcrowding on the female side, but on that of the males there was an excess of 4 for a short time. To prevent this overcrowding, I think it necessary that more attention should be paid to the suitability of cases sent to the Asylum. Chief Commissioner's Book Circular No. XXXI, dated 5th October 1877, points out that, in the case of harmless lunatics, nothing is ordinarily gained by transfer to an Asylum. The Asylum is meant for dangerous and violent cases. I have several cases in the Asylum who are not likely to gain any benefit and should not, I think, have been sent to the Asylum. In one case, the report says that the man was found wandering and did not talk rationally, but was not dangerous to himself or to others ; the man was a professional beggar. He is at present in the Asylum perfectly harmless, quiet and inoffensive. Another case, that of a female professional beggar, was sent to the Asylum with no real history of insanity. On arrival at the Asylum she was very anæmic and silly. There are at present in the Asylum 10 men and 7 women who should not have been sent and who will never benefit by being in the Asylum. They are more fit for the poor-house. 11. We have in this Asylum only 10 solitary cells (8 males and 2 females). This is, I consider, not sufficient, and we are often caused a considerable amount of anxiety owing to the want of means of segregating dangerous and violent cases. Eight cells more are required, 6 for males and 2 for females. This addition would obviate, for the present, any overcrowding.
( 27 ) STATEMENT II. 12. Deals with criminal lunatics. The total remaining at the beginning of the year was 38 (34 males, 4 females), classified thus:( 28 ) These three cases have been pronounced cured in consultation with the Superintendent, Lunatic Asylum, Nagpur. Discharged otherwise 2. These were simply changed from criminal to non-criminal owing to the expiry of their sentence under section 31, Act V of 1871, Prisoners' Act. (1) Mahadeva Pershad was convicted of the offence of rape and was sen- tenced to seven years' rigorous imprisonment on the 13th November 1892 and transferred to this Asylum on the 19th November 1893 ; his sentence expired on the 12th November 1899. He is still very violent and troublesome and unfit for discharge. (2) Babu Bania was transferred from the District Jail, Damoh, on 13th September 1899. His sentence expiring on the 3rd October 1899, he was trans- ferred to the non-criminal list. It appears he was sentenced to six months' rigorous imprisonment under section 457, I. P. C. On admission into the Asylum he was very thin and emaciated, but he soon improved mentally and physically. He said he had suffered very much from fever, and on account of this lost his reason. 14. Admissions.( 29 ) (3) Mulli alias Murari Lal.( 30 ) He said some one had come in the night and told him to do it. He could not remember at once where he had put the things, but gradually remembered, and at last all the things were recovered. He was sent to the under-trial ward of the Jail, where he became very violent and abusive and slept badly, but gradually became quieter, and after a few days begged to be allowed to go home, as his father was too old to work in the field. He said he had taken to ganja-smoking owing to grief at the death of his brother. Now he says he attributes his insanity to having eaten lachkha, a mixture of wheat and mhowa. This got into his head and made it hot. Is now very sensible and repentant. (7) Babu Bania.( 31 ) STATEMENT V. 17. Gives the ages. Shows that the most active period of life, from 20 to 40, contributes the majority of admissions, which supports the inference pre- viously made. STATEMENT VI. 18. Deals with the types of insanity in accordance with the Nomenclature of Diseases. Mania acute, chronic and epileptic account for 23 (20 males, 3 females); melancholia, epileptic and other forms account for 6 (4 males, 2 females) and dementia, acute, chronic and epileptic for 4 (3 males, 1 female). STATEMENT VII. 19. Points to the alleged causes. Physical causes( 32 ) The majority of the cases admitted into the Asylum are in a poor state of health, while the old patients have been particularly healthy. It is certainly peculiar that the lunatics should be so free from sickness, especially as the majority of them eat dirt. One will swallow lumps of chappaties without mastication, others have to be forcibly fed for years. A great many with difficulty are made to keep clothes on, even on the coldest days. If the same condition happened in the Jail, what would the sickness be ? 22. Mortality.( 33 ) TABLE I. 29. Shows the amount received from the Treasury, Asylum and other Departments on account of expenditure during the year 1899 :( 34 ) 32. I subjoin a table giving the charges under the principal heads for the year 1899 and ten previous years :( 35 ) Statement 1, column 9, shows the total average strength as 155.02. In the above table, it is shown as 156.02 ; the difference is due to there being a child of 5½ years belonging to one of the female lunatics. The Rewah State pays for this child. The average cost per head was (including Public Works Department charges) Rs.63-8-1 against Rs.84-4-3: excluding these charges, Rs.61-10-6 against Rs.62-10-7 in 1898. The only item showing an increase was that of clothing. A larger number of blanket-coats were supplied this year. This Rs.61-10-6 does not represent the actual cost to Government per head ; from it must be deducted the sum paid into the Treasury as profits on manufactories and the amount received and credited into the Treasury from paying- patients. 33. The following calculation shows the savings under the above heads and the actual net cost to the State of each inmate per annum :(36 ) 35. The following was given daily to the lunatics from the beginning of May to November :( 37 ) Lieutenant-Colonel W. A. Quayle, M.D., I.M.S., was Superintendent from 10th March to 11th December 1899 Deputy Superintendent, Rai Saheb Mohan Lall, showed the same enthusiasm, and the poor unfortunates recognize him as their best friend. He certainly has a wonderful control over them. I would again strongly recommend him for some personal allowance. He is near his retirement and will only get the half of Rs.55. He has an allowance of Rs.30. If this could be made a consolidated pay, it would increase his retiring allowance. JUBBULPORE : H. K. McKAY, LT.-COL., I.M.S., C.I.E., Dated 15th January 1900.

No. 3373. Extract from the Proceedings of the Hon'ble the Officiating Chief Commissioner, Central Provinces, in the General Department, dated Pachmarhi, the 30th April 1903. READ2 4. The period under report has been characterised by the poor health of the inmates of both Asylums. Nagpur has a much higher daily average of sick and a heavier death-rate than Jubbulpore. The bad health of the patients is ascribed to the effects of the famine of 1900, and to the prevalence of influenza in 1901. The diet at the Nagpur Asylum differs from that given at Jubbulpore, where the staple food is wheat only, but this is the natural consequence of the difference in the customary food of the people in the various parts of the Prov- ince from which the patients come. The question of diet was gone into by the Administrative Medical Officer, who has made some alteration in the allowance of oil and condiments allowed to the Nagpur patients. An explanation is given in paragraph 16 of the Report of the apparently small sum spent on clothing and bedding. There is no reason to think that the ill-health of the patients at Nagpur was due to defect in these particulars. The Officiating Chief Commis- sioner found, on a visit to the Asylum, that the hospital accommodation is very inadequate, and steps will be at once taken to provide a suitable hospital. 5. The remarks made by the Administrative Medical Officer on the defective character of the information supplied in regard to the history of lunatics sug- gest the need for greater effort in this direction. It is not desirable to delay cases while inquiries as to previous history are being made, but the making of such inquiries should not be neglected. If particulars are not available at the time when papers are sent in, they may when received be communicated to the Asylum authorities in a supplementary report. The fullest possible information as to previous history is wanted so as to enable the Superintendent and visitors to form an accurate opinion as to the expediency of discharge. Omission to supply such information when available may have the effect of facilitating the premature release of dangerous patients who would otherwise be kept longer under observation. 6. The Officiating Chief Commissioner agrees that the pay of the warders is insufficient. The work involves considerable responsibility, and it is vain to expect to get the services of men of the proper type on a rate of pay (Rs. 6 a month) considerably below what has to be paid to menial servants in Nagpur and Jubbulpore. The Officiating Chief Commissioner will give favourable consideration to proposals for the improvement of the pay and the grading of the warders. 7. The report shows that due provision is made for the employment and amusement of patients. Rewards are given to hardworking and well-behaved lunatics in accordance with the orders of the Government of India; and the adoption of this system is said to have been attended with good results. The Nagpur Asylum maintains a Dairy Farm from which a net cash profit of over five and a half thousand rupees was derived during the period under report. 8. The management of the Asylums appears to have been satisfactory and the supervision of the Administrative Medical Officer careful and thorough. The thanks of the Administration are tendered to the latter and to the officers named in the concluding paragraph of the report. ORDER.TABLE OF CONTENTS. Para.

Alteration of report from an annual to a triennial one. Prior to the year 1900, the Report on Lunatic Asylums was prepared annu- ally. In paragraph 10 of Government of India, Home Department, letter No. 2745, dated the 26th March 1901, it was directed that, in future, the report should be submitted triennially ; the present report, which deals with the circumstances of the years 1900, 1901 and 1902, is therefore the first one submitted in accordance with the above instruc- tions. Cause of delay in submission of report. 2. The report should have been sent to Press on the 10th February, but it was not possible to do this, as the reports on the Nag- pur and Jubbulpore Asylums were received late. The Superintendents of the Asylums, who are also Civil Surgeons of the districts, were much occupied with measures in connection with plague, and hence were unable to submit their reports on the prescribed dates. Some delay also occurred in this office owing to my absence on tour. Officers in charge. 3. During the year 1900 the Nagpur Asylum was in charge of the following officers, viz., Major A. Silcock, I. M. S., from 1st January to 23rd March; Major A. Buchanan, I. M. S., from 24th to 26th March, and Lieutenant-Colonel W. A. Quayle, I. M. S., from 27th March to 31st December. In 1901 Lieutenant-Colonel Quayle held charge from 1st January to 13th April and again from 15th November to 31st Decem- ber, while Major Buchanan held charge from 14th April to 14th November. In 1902 Lieutenant-Colonel Quayle held charge throughout the year. Lieuten- ant-Colonel H. K. McKay, I. M. S., C. I. E., held charge of the Jubbulpore Asylum throughout the years 1900 and 1901. During the year 1902 the following officers held charge, viz., Lieutenant-Colonel H. K. McKay, from 1st January to 10th July and again from 12th October to 13th December; Captain P. F. Chapman, I. M. S., from 11th July to 11th October, and Captain D. Lawson, R. A. M. C., from 14th to 31st December, during Lieutenant-Colonel McKay's temporary absence at the Delhi Durbar. Buildings. 4. Nagpur Asylum.2 report have, with the exception of Statements I and II, been drawn up for the year 1902 only. In adopting this course, the practice observed in the case of the returns appended to the triennial reports on dispensaries and vaccination has been followed. Prior to the year 1900, it was customary to show in Statements I and 11 the statistics relating to the year under report and ten previous years ; but in paragraph 10 of Home Department letter of 26th March 1901, already quoted above, as amended by the Local Administration in its letter No. 6255, dated the 1st July 1901, the entries in these statements have been limited to the three years under report. In the remaining Statements III to X (except- ing IX), although the statistics for the year 1902 only have been given in detail, the totals for the two preceding years have been entered at the foot of the tables to facilitate comparison. STATEMENT I. Accommodation and popula- tion. 6. In the Nagpur Asylum the daily average population was well within the capacity during each of the three years under report, and on no single occasion did the population exceed the capacity In the Jubbulpore Asylum the daily average strength approximated the capacity in each of the three years, and in regard to females slightly exceeded it. In both institutions the daily average strength of male insanes shows a progressive decrease during the three years under report; that of female insanes on the contrary shows a progressive increase. It may become necessary later on to consider the question of providing increased accommodation for female lunatics. Admissions and re-admis- sions. 7. Nagpur Asylum.3 He adds that of the old cases, the great majority are subjects of chronic disease, in whom there is little hope of recovery. The results therefore are not so bad as a first glance at the figures might lead one to infer. Sickness and mortality. 9. During the triennial period, the admissions into hospital aggregated 245 in the Nagpur Asylum and 261 in the Jubbulpore institution. The chief causes of sickness were malarial fevers, bowel-complaints, influenza, epilepsy, bronchitis, debility and ulcers. The deaths in the Nagpur Asylum numbered 36 and in the Jubbulpore Ayslum 20. Judged by the daily average number of sick, the health of the Nagpur Asylum has been by no means as good as that of Jubbulpore during the triennium. 1900 was a year of dire famine and sickness, and the conditions resulting therefrom were continued into 1901. The effects of these adverse con- ditions were felt within the asylum also, and explain the high sick and death rates in the Nagpur Asylum in 1900. In 1901 influenza was prevalent, and caused two deaths. The figures for 1902 show a marked improvement. Malarial fevers and dysentery were much less prevalent, and there was no influenza. The Superin- tendent writes :4 STATEMENT VI. Types of insanity. 14. Mania, as usual, holds the first place. Next to it comes dementia, the termination of most cases of mental disease that pursue a downward course, ending finally in complete abolition of mind. Although roughly one-fourth of the total population during the triennium were females, in regard to the different types of insanity the proportion of females varies from 50 per cent. under the head idiocy to 10 per cent. in the case of melancholia. STATEMENT VII. Alleged causes of insanity. 15. In regard to more than half the total number of inmates during the triennium the cause of insanity is reported to be unknown. On the face of it, this would seem to indicate imperfect enquiry. The admissions for 1902 show improvement in this respect, the unknown causes being roughly one-fourth of the total. When the cause was known, the insanity is ascribed in some 60 per cent. of the cases to physical and in 40 per cent. to moral causes. Of the physical causes, the most numerous are heredity, epilepsy, and ganja-smoking. Amongst the inmates of the Jubbul- pore Asylum, ganja-smoking appears to be a more frequent cause of insanity than in the case of Nagpur. In the Jubbulpore Asylum also moral causes of insanity are in marked excess as compared with the Nagpur Asylum. The Superintendent of the Nagpur Asylum writes as follows :5 this fell to Rs. 65-10-11 in 1901 and to Rs. 64-6-6 in 1902. The comparatively high rates in 1900 for both institutions were due to the famine and high prices. STATEMENT IX. Establishment. 18. The warders and keepers are poorly paid6 Employment. 23. In the Nagpur Asylum, gardening and farm work provide healthy employment for a considerable number of the inmates. in Jubbulpore, there is no farm or dairy ; there is, how- ever, an excellent garden in which many of the lunatics work ; weaving is also carried on; the clothing is all supplied from the asylum looms, no outside labour being employed; females are chiefly employed on grinding corn and spinning. In both asylums the lunatics are also employed on certain menial duties. In Jubbulpore, the cooking is particularly good. Amusements. 24. Nagpur Asylum.APPENDICES.

No. 3363- FROM G. SHERLOCK-HUBBARD, ESQ., ASSISTANT SECRETARY TO THE HON'BLE THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces, TO THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, HOME DEPARTMENT. Nagpur, the 6th April 1904. SIR, I am directed to submit herewith a copy of the notes on the Annual Statements on the Lunatic Asylums in the Central Provinces for the year 1903, and to say that the work of the year will be reviewed in due course when the Triennial Report for the year ending 1905 comes to be dealt with. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, G. SHERLOCK-HUBBARD, Assistant Secretary. Secretariat Press, Nagpur:BRIEF NOTES ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES FOR THE YEAR 1903. The appended statements for 1903 are prepared in accordance with the instructions conveyed in Government of India, Home Department, Medical, Resolution Nos. 212 STATEMENT VII. In 1902, in both asylums, the causes of insanity were shown as "unknown" in regard to about one-fourth of the new admissions. The same proportion holds good in 1903 in the case of the Jubbulpore Asylum. In the Nagpur Asylum, however, the cause of insanity is said to have been unknown in more than half of the new admissions. The reason for this variation is not obvious and will be enquired into. STATEMENT VIII. The amounts shown as received from paying patients in the Nagpur Asylum include Rs. 2,025 on account of 27 Berar lunatics at Rs. 75 per head. Calculated on items 8 to 14 inclusive and item 21 of Statement VIII, the average cost per head in the Nagpur Asylum was Rs. 90-6-6 and in the Jubbul- pore Asylum Rs. 60-8-5. In the Nagpur Asylum the diet charges were consi- derably higher than in Jubbulpore, also the charges under contingencies proper and under clothing and bedding. The difference in the dieting charges of the two asylums appears to be in some measure due to a difference in the system of accounts. This is being enquired into. The Nagpur dieting charges include Rs. 1,894-7-6 on account of articles supplied by the Asylum Dairy and Farm. Similarly in the Nagpur Asylum contingencies proper include a charge of Rs. 1,474-8-4 on account of Dairy Farm expenses. The clothing and bedding of the Nagpur Asylum was much improved during the year; this charge also includes some unadjusted items of the year previous. The Jubbulpore dieting charges are inclusive of Rs. 293-10-10 on account of articles supplied by the asylum garden. STATEMENT IX. The pay of the warder establishment has recently been very much improved. The head warders now get Rs. 15 a month, and warders from Rs. 12 to Rs. 8 according to grade. A better class of recruit may now with confidence be expected. In both asylums the arrangements for watch and ward, especially at night, have been improved. STATEMENT X. The profits on manufactures in the Nagpur Asylum are, as in previous years, mainly derived from the Dairy and attached Farm. M. D. MORIARTY, COL., I. M.

No. 4494. CENTRAL PROVINCES SECRETARIAT. General Department. FROM F. S. A. SLOCOCK, ESQ., I. C. S., SECOND SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, HOME DEPARTMENT. Nagpur, the 10th April 1905. SIR, I am directed to submit, herewith, three copies of the Notes on the Annual Statements on the Lunatic Asylums in the Central Provinces for the year 1904, and to say that the work of the year will be reviewed in due course when the Triennial Report for the year ending 1905 comes to be dealt with. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, F. S. A. SLOCOCK, Second Secretary. Secretariat Press, Nagpur:BRIEF NOTES ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES FOR THE YEAR 1904. The statements appended to this Note have been prepared in accordance with the instructions conveyed in Government of India, Home Department (Medical) Resolution No. 212 In the Jubbulpore Asylum there were 9 deaths (equal to 5.99 per cent. of daily average strength) against 8 in 1903. Two of these insanes had been over 33 years in the Asylum, one being 84 and the other 88 years of age. There were two deaths from pneumonia, and one from dysentery. A fatal case of plague occurred in December. The adjoining portion of the town was at the time plague-infected. The usual precautions were taken. No further case occurred. STATEMENT VII. The causes of insanity are said to have been unknown in about one-fourth of the admissions in the Jubbulpore Asylum. The proportion is practically the same as in the year previous. In the Nagpur Asylum more care appears to have been taken than in previous years to ascertain the causes of insanity in the case of new admissions. A reference to the district from which the insane comes often leads to the desired information being obtained. STATEMENT VIII. The amount shown as received from paying patients in the Nagpur Asylum, viz., Rs. 2,147-7-6, includes Rs. 1,694-4-0 on account of 23 Berar lunatics at Rs. 75 per head. Calculated on items 8 to 14 inclusive and item 21 of State- ment VIII, the average cost per head in the Nagpur Asylum was Rs. 91-1-6, practically the same as in 1903, and in the Jubbulpore Asylum Rs. 68-8-10, or Rs. 8-0-5 more than in the previous year. The increase in the cost in the Jub- bulpore Asylum is due to some extent to improvement in the pay of warders and to improvement in the diet scale. In the Nagpur Asylum the cost per head was apparently much higher than in Jubbulpore The contingent expenditure in Nag- pur amounts to Rs. 3,440 whilst in Jubbulpore it was only Rs. 580-12-6. The contingent expenditure in the Nagpur Asylum is mainly incurred in connection with the Dairy Farm, the income from which is credited to Government. Making allowance for the receipts (approximately Rs. 3,000) from the Dairy Farm at Nag- pur, the actual cost per head in the two Asylums does not differ very materially. STATEMENT X. The blankets manufactured at the Jubbulpore Asylum and sold to the pub- lic realized Rs. 200 more than in 1903. All the Asylum clothing, including that of the Establishment, is manufactured by the lunatics. At Nagpur the clothing and bedding is purchased. The Dairy Farm at the Nagpur Asylum has continued to work satisfactorily. It supplies the wants not only of the inmates of the Asylum, but also to a large extent of the public. The attached Farm has also proved a profitable concern. It is to be hoped that the question of a new Central Asylum at Chhindwara will soon be decided. The Asylums at Jubbulpore and Nagpur are neither of them quite up to modern standards. They have, however, been used to the best advantage and have been well managed by their respective Superintendents. They have been to some extent improved, but as previously noted further improvements have been postponed pending a final decision on the question of a new Central Asylum. The diet scale in both Asylums has been improved. The lunatics are well fed and well clothed. Their amusements are attended to, and every consider- ation is shown them. M. D. MORIARTY, COLONEL, M. D., F. R. C. S. I., I. M. S., Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Central Provinces.

CENTRAL PROVINCES ADMINISTRATION. General department. No. 5809-A. Nagpur, the 15th May 1906. READ2 3. In spite of a decrease of 10 in the average population of the asylums, 93 lunatics were discharged as cured as compared with 84 in the preceding period. The Chief Commissioner agrees with the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals that recovered criminal lunatics transferred to Jails should be shown as "cured," the asylums being concerned with the medical and not the criminal aspect of the case. A welcome improvement was shown in the general health of the inmates, the total admissions to hospital numbering only 359 against 506 for the years 1900TABLE OF CONTENTS. Paras.

A. WEIR, M. B., I. M. S., INSPECTOR-GENERAL OF CIVIL HOSPITALS, Central Provinces, To THE CHIEF SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, CENTRAL PROVINCES, GENERAL DEPARTMENT. Nagpur, the 5th March 1906. SIR, I have the honour to submit the Triennial Report on the Lunatic Asylums at Nagpur and Jubbulpore for the years 1903, 1904 and 1905, together with the prescribed statements, which have been prepared with due regard to the instructions contained in Government of India, Home Department, Medical, Resolution No. 2131, dated the 12th January 1904. Officers in charge. 2. Lieutenant-Colonel Quayle, I. M. S., held charge of the Nagpur Asylum for 3 months and Captain W. A. Kenrick for 6 months in 1903, while Captain G.O.F. Sealy, who was Special Plague Medical Officer at Nagpur, was in temporary charge for about a month in April of that year. Lieutenant-Colonel C. L. Swaine assumed charge on 1st November 1903 and continued till he proceeded on furlough on 17th Octo- ber 1905, on which date Lieutenant-Colonel J. L. Poynder relieved him and held charge till the close of the year. At Jubbulpore, Lieutenant-Colonel (now Colonel) H. K. McKay, I. M. S., C. I. E., held charge for a month, Captain P. F. Chapman for about 2 months and Lieutenant-Colonel Quayle for 7½ months in 1903, while Captain D. Lawson, R. A. M. C, Lieutenant T. S. B. Wil- liams, I. M. S., and Major E. McK. Williams, R. A. M. C., held collateral charge for short periods. Lieutenant-Colonel Quayle held charge throughout the year 1904 and for about 2 months in 1905, when he proceeded on leave, handing over charge to Major A. G. Hendley, who retained it till the close of the year. STATEMENT I. Accommodation and popu- lation. 3. The daily average strength in the Nagpur Asylum was within its capacity, while in Jubbulpore there was slight overcrowd- ing, amongst both males and females, during the trien- nial period, particularly in 1903, when at one time the males were 10 and the females 7 in excess of the available accommodation. To remedy this defect it was proposed, in 1903, to remove all female lunatics to the Nagpur Asylum and place them under the care of a responsible matron. With this object two wards to accommodate 38 lunatics, a block of 6 cells and quarters for a matron were erected in 1903-04, and additional wards were about to be erected, but, as the question of establishing a central asylum at Chhindwara for European and Eura- sian insanes from Upper India and native insanes from the Central Provinces and Berar, was raised in 1904 by the Government of Bengal, the further improve- ments in contemplation were suspended pending the decision of the Government of India. A new hospital and two solitary cells for females were erected at Jubbul- pore
2 Admissions and re-admissions. 4. The number of inmates remaining over from 1902 was 162 in Nagpur and 155 in Jubbulpore. During the triennium, the admissions and re-admissions in Nagpur were 26 in 1903, 28 in 1904 and 46 in 1905, (as compared with 25 in 1900, 23 in 1901, 35 in 1902), and in jubbulpore 18 in 1903, 26 in 1904 and 22 in 1905 against 28, 19 and 21 during the three years preceding. The slight increase in admissions in Nagpur in 1903 and 1904 may probably be due to closer supervision exercised by the Police over vagrant lunatics, but the striking increase in 1905 is due mainly to the admission of insanes from Central India, in accordance with Government of India, Home Department, letter No. 241, dated the 8th March 1905. The Jubbulpore Asylum being already overcrowded, some lunatics from the northern districts were, in addition, admitted to the Nagpur Asylum. Discharges. 5. The number of lunatics discharged from the Nagpur Asylum during the triennium was 633 of the period and the breaking down of very old. feeble and epileptic lunatics account for the high mortality in both asylums. The absence of deaths from dysentery and pneumonia in the Jubbulpore Asylum, where there was only one admission to hospital from dysentery during each of the past three years, is a satisfactory feature in the report and reflects credit on the management of that asylum. STATEMENT II. Criminal lunatics. 7. There were 46 criminal lunatics remaining on the 1st January 1903 in the Nagpur Asylum, and 16 were admitted and 1 re- admitted during the past triennium. Eighteen were dis- charged, of whom 4 were placed on the non-criminal list and 6 left " improved " ; 3 were discharged " cured " direct from the asylum as they had completed their term of sentence; I was sent to stand his trial and was discharged by the Court; 3 were cured and transferred to jail to complete the remaining period of their sentence; and one was transferred to the Central Jail, Nagpur, to complete his term of sentence, but was returned and re-admitted. In the Jubbulpore Asylum 35 criminal lunatics remained over on the 1st January 1903, and 25 were admit- ted and readmitted and 18 discharged. The Superintendent's report gives no details as to how they were discharged. STATEMENT III. Religion, sex and residence. 8. Hindus formed the largest number (115) of the admissions during the past triennium4 triennium, 148 suffered from mania, 52 from dementia, 41 from melancholia and 21 from idiocv. Of these 61 were discharged as cured or improved, 46 being cases of mania, 13 of melancholia and 2 of dementia. At Jubbulpore, where 221 lunatics were treated, 145 suffered from mania, 35 from dementia, 19 from idiocy, 17 from melancholia and 5 from delusional insanity. Of these 53 were discharged as cured and improved, 45 being cases of mania, 4 of melancholia, 3 of delusional insanity and 1 of dementia. STATEMENT VII. Alleged causes of insanity. 12. More care was taken in 1905 than in previous years in ascertaining the cause of insanity of persons relegated to the asylum. At Nagpur in only a few cases did the Police supply the required information. In most cases it was obtained from relatives and friends who visited the patients. In Jubbulpore, in only one instance was the cause of insanity not traceable, the patient being a " silent" woman who gives no account of herself. Her name is not known, and she has not, so far, been identified by any one. In the majority of admissions to both asylums, ganja- smoking, spirit-drinking, epilepsy and heredity were the chief causes. In the case of 12 in Nagpur and 19 in Jubbulpore the insanity is attributed to moral causes, such as religious impressions, grief, loss of property, etc. STATEMENT VIII. Finances. 13. The receipts from "paying patients" in the Nagpur Asylum during the past year amounted to Rs. 2,618 against Rs. 2,147 in 1904 and Rs. 2,539 in 1903, while at Jubbulpore they were Rs. 1,912 in 1905, Rs. 1,469 in 1904 and Rs. 1,426 in 1903. These amounts include (1) contributions made by the Native States and British cantonments outside the limits of the Central Provinces, for the maintenance of lunatics sent by them, and (2) sums paid by relatives and friends towards the main- tenance of patients. The heading is misleading, and I think, with Major Hendley, that the column should be sub-divided to show these items separately. Of Rs. 1,912 received in Jubbulpore in the past year, only Rs. 97 were paid for the support of a patient by his friends, the remainder being contributions paid by the States to whom the lunatics were chargeable. The total charges at the Nagpur Asylum amounted to Rs. 24,372 in 1905 against Rs. 35,960 in 1904 and Rs. 21,892 in 1903. In 1905, the erection of an air-motor, certain improvements to the dairy, an increase in the scale of diet with substitution of wheat for jowar as the staple food, and the purchase of extra cattle for the dairy have contributed to the increased expenditure, while in 1904 the erection of two wards, a block of six solitary cells and matron's quarters increased the expenditure. The excess expenditure under "Estab- lishment" proper is due to revision of establishment, and that under the head "Clothing and bedding" to the supply of additional blankets to the inmates. The large increase under " Contingent" charges is due to the purchase of a cream-separator and other utensils for the dairy, and the slight increase under " Rates and taxes " is made up of the extra water tax which had to be paid for the supply of Ambajheri tank water when the hand pumps attached to the wells failed to work. The total expenditure in the Jubbulpore Asylum for the past year amounted to Rs. 13,696 against Rs. 15,601 in 1904 and Rs. 11,301 in 1903. The large expenditure in 1904 is accounted for by the erection of a hospital and two solitary cells. The increase in " Establishment" charges during the triennium is due to the revision of establishment in November 1903, and that under the head " Diet" to the revision of the diet scale and to the rise in the price of food-grains. Incidence of expenditure. 14. The incidence of expenditure in Nagpur in 1905 was Rs. 107-14-1, the highest recorded during the past six years, and is due to the revision of establishment and of the diet scale In Jubbulpore, for the same reasons, the incidence of expenditure rose from Rs. 60.8-5 in 1903 to Rs. 68-8-10 in 1904 and to Rs. 75-15-11 in 1905. STATEMENT IX. Establishment. 15. The pay of the warders and keepers was increased at the close of 1903, so that a better class of subordinates might be entertained for the watch and ward of the inmates. The establish- ment of the Nagpur Asylum is still inadequate, and proposals are now under con- sideration to increase it.
5 STATEMENT X. Profit and loss on manufac- ture. 16. The net profits of the Nagpur Asylum during the triennium amounted to Rs. 4,296 in 1905, Rs. 5,408 in 1904 and Rs. 5,546 in 1903. The decrease in 1905 is due to the dairy farm and is ex- plained in paragraph 23 infra. The profits of the Jubbulpore Asylum amounted to Rs. 1,041 in 1905, Rs. 1,148 in 1904 and Rs. 949 in 1903. The large profits in Nagpur as compared with Jubbulpore have accrued mainly from the dairy farm at the former institution. GENERAL REMARKS. Prophylactics. 17. At the Nagpur Asylum 2 to 5 grains of quinine were given to each lunatic every week in the months of July to November, and at Jubbulpore the weekly dose of 2 grains was raised to 10 grains with the result that there was a large diminution in the number of admissions for malarial fevers. In addition, anti-scorbutics, consisting of lemons, lime-pickle, tamarind, roselle, mangoes, &c, being the produce of the asylum gardens, were freely issued in both institutions. Diet. 18. The scale of diet was revised in both asylums during the triennium. In Nagpur wheat was substituted for jowar with most satis- factory results. Injuries. 19. At Nagpur there were 2 admissions to hospital for injuries, 1 in 1904 being a case of murder, referred to in the notes for that year, and the other in 1905. The latter was an epileptic who, while in a fit, fell and hurt his elbow and knees, but recovered quickly. Employment. 20. In Nagpur the lunatics found congenial occupation in garden and farm work, and many of them have improved considerably in their physical and mental condition. To provide work for those who could not be trusted outside and who were hitherto kept locked up, a considerable portion of the waste land inside the asylum enclosure was brought under cultivation. A few lunatics used to be employed in drawing water from the wells, but to guard against the danger of accidents an air-motor has now been fixed. The attached dairy also provides pleasant occupation for some lunatics. In Jubbulpore the lunatics are most usefully employed in manufacturing clothing and bedding for themselves and uniforms for the warders and also on gardening. Amusement. 21. In Nagpur seven magic lantern entertainments were given during the triennium. In addition to card-playing and musical instruments, football was introduced and has proved a pleasant pastime. Sweetmeats were distributed on occasions, such as festival days, which the lunatics were allowed to observe when they chose to do so. Some Christian and Muhammadan story books were also supplied at Nagpur to those who can read, and this has created in some the desire to be taught to read and write by their fellow inmates, who cordially assume the position of school- masters. No change in amusements was made in Jubbulpore. Rewards. 22. The system of giving money rewards to well- behaved lunatics was continued: the money was generally expended in the purchase of sweets. Nagpur Dairy Farm. 23. During the triennium, Rs. 12,425-2-10 were realized from the sale of dairy produce, the expenditure amounting to Rs. 8,140-6-3, giving a net profit of Rs. 4,284-12-7. Further, milk worth Rs. 837-14-1 was supplied to the inmates. Owing to the sale of some animals which it was desirable to get rid of, the profits of the dairy in 1905 were slightly less than in 1904. The number and breed of the cattle have now been improved, and better results are expected in the future. Inspections. 24. The Nagpur Asylum was thrice visited by the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner during the triennium, twice by the Di- rector-General, Indian Medical Service, and four times by the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Central Provinces, one being a surprise visit. The Inspector-General of Police also paid two surprise night visits. The Jubbulpore Asylum was twice inspected by the Hon'ble the Chief
6 Commissioner, twice by the Director-General, Indian Medical Service, and four times by the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals. The official visitors of both the institutions met regularly every month, and to them as well as to the Superintendents and Deputy Superintendents, the successful management of the asylums is mainly due. Notice of Officers. 25. The Superintendents and the Deputy Superintendents have worked with zeal and energy. Rai Sahib Mohan Lal, Deputy Superintendent, Jubbulpore, has continued to render valuable services, and Kashinath Gopal at Nagpur has proved an excellent Deputy Superintendent in every way. Besides being well qualified professionally, he is tactful and sympathetic with the inmates, whose confidence he apparently enjoys. 26. The work in the Nagpur Asylum is now too heavy for the Deputy Superin- tendent to manage single-handed. I agree with Lieutenant-Colonel Poynder that an assistant should be given him to undertake the medical portion of the work, and in anticipation of sanction, I have posted a reserve Hospital Assistant to the asylum, The question of establishing a Central Asylum at Chhindwara is still pending. It is desirable that a decision should be come to at an early date, as needful alterations and additions to both the existing asylums are in the meantime held up. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, P. A. WEIR, M. B., COL., I. M. S., Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Central Provinces.

No. 534BRIEF NOTES TO ACCOMPANY THE ANNUAL STATEMENTS ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES FOR THE YEAR 1906. The statements appended have been prepared in accordance with the instruc- tions contained in Government of India, Home Department (Medical), Resolution No. 212 adjustments. The average cost per head in Nagpur was Rs. 97, or Rs. 11 less than that in the previous year; while in Jubbulpore it was Rs. 78 per head, or Rs. 2 more than that of 1905, the increase being due to the enhanced allowance paid to the Deputy Superintendent and to a rise in the prices of food-grains. Statement No. X. 7. During the year under report there was a profit on account of manufac- tures of Rs. 4,176 in Nagpur and of Rs. 1,038 in the Jubbulpore Asylum against Rs. 4,297 and Rs. 1,041 respectively in 1905. The profits in the Nagpur Asylum are mainly derived from the farm and attached dairy. P. A. WEIR, M. B., COL., I. M. S., Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Central Provinces.

No. 818-VI. FROM MAJOR T. C. PLOWDEN, I. A., THIRD SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, HOME DEPARTMENT. Nagpur, the 22nd April 1908. SIR, I am directed to submit, herewith, three copies of the Notes on the Annual Statements of the Lunatic Asylums in the Central Provinces for the year 1907, and to say that the work will be reviewed in due course when the Triennial Report for the year ending 1908 is dealt with. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, T. C. PLOWDEN, Third Secretary.
BRIEF NOTES TO ACCOMPANY THE ANNUAL STATEMENTS ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES FOR THE YEAR 1907. On 1st July 1907, the necessary accommodation having at last been completed, all the female insanes at Jubbulpore, 36 in number, together with their attendants, were transferred to the Asylum at Nagpur, and the female side of the Jubbulpore Asylum became available for receiving males. It has since been decided that the Jubbulpore males shall also be transferred to Nagpur, the Asylum at Jubbulpore being entirely given up: this, it is hoped, will be possible by October or November of the current year. The provision of the additional accommodation that will be required, for insanes and for staff, is being proceeded with. Statement I. 2. At Nagpur, in 1907, the admissions and re-admissions were 49(34 males and 15 females) against 36 in 1906. On adding to this number the 36 female insanes from Jubbulpore, the total admissions aggregate 85 (34 males and 51 females). At Jubbulpore 15 males and 1 female were admitted. The daily average strength was 317.15 against 298.50 in 1906: the increase of 19 was made up mostly of females (14, to 5 males). There was slight overcrowding on the male side at Jubbulpore until the transfer of the females There were 28 cures2 later. In approximately 81 per cent of his admissions causes were assigned: 28 per cent of these were debited to the use of ganja, and 10 per cent to the use of alcohol. In 16 per cent the disease was said to have been inherited. At Jubbulpore 11 of the 16 admissions were ascribed to physical causes 6 to ganja and charas, 2 to malaria, 2 to heredity and 1 to privation and 5 were due to moral causes (overstudy, overstudy with insomnia, loss of occupation and consequent mental anxiety, family trouble and religious impressions). Statement VIII. 9. The receipts for the year included Rs 1,561 from paying patients at Nagpur and Rs. 1,692 at Jubbulpore, or Rs. 3,253 in all against Rs. 4,397 in the previous year. The total expenditure was Rs. 48,283 (against Rs. 38,498 in 1906), viz., Rs. 34,821 at Nagpur and Rs. 13,462 at Jubbulpore. The large expenditure at Nagpur is chiefly due to the attached dairy farm and to the increase in the establishment. The cost per head netted Rs. 86 at Nagpur and Rs. 77 at Jubbulpore: the figures for 1906 were Rs. 97 and Rs. 78, respectively. 10. The transfer of the female insanes from Jubbulpore to Nagpur neces- sitated an increase to the staff at the latter asylum : detail of the staff in both asylums is given in Statement IX. Statement X. 11. Profits from manufactures were stationary at Jubbulpore and fell by Rs. 260 at Nagpur, probably from lessened outturn in the dairy. The stock of cattle was weeded out and fresh stock to the value of Rs. 700 purchased. P. A. WEIR, M. B., COL., I. M. S., NAGPUR : Inspector- General of Civil Hospitals, The 9th March 1908.

CENTRAL PROVINCES ADMINISTRATION. Education and Medical Department. No. 716-A/VI-32-4 Nagpur, the 19th May 1909. READ2 4. The number of discharges was 55 in Nagpur, and 48 in Jubbulpore (the 36 females transferred having been wrongly included in the return of discharges), 103 in all, of whom 84 were cured, and 10 improved; there were 6 escapes, of which only 1 has been recaptured. Of the 4 escapes from Nagpur the Superintendent has recorded that 3 were practically cured, and 1 much improved. The more tractable lunatics enjoy a very considerable liberty, and 2 of the escapes in Nagpur simply walked away from the farm ; but the Chief Commissioner considers that more precautions are required for the custody of criminal lunatics, especially new admissions. It is not very uncommon for criminals to feign madness and then to find an opportunity for escaping from the Asylums. The large number of cures is a testimony to the truth of the remark made by Colonel Roe, the Superintendent of the Nagpur Asylum, that "on the whole the lunatics lead a very happy life." 5. The causes of insanity are now better ascertained than was formally the case, but the information obtained still leaves much to be desired. There are of course many cases in which the history is not traceable, but there are others in which sufficient trouble is not taken to ascertain it. The districts of Jubbulpore and Nagpur account for the greatest number of new admissions. Beggars, labourers and cultivators are invariably the classes most largely represented. 6. With higher prices of food-grains, and an enlarged and better-paid establishment of Asylum attendants, the cost of maintaining the Asylums has increased. The Chief Commissioner will be glad to consider any proposals for improving the farm and dairy, which do not appear to have been so successful as they once were. It is possible that the Superintendent may be able to buy cows from the Telinkheri Farm, which, though not quite true to type for breeding purposes, might be very serviceable as milch-cows. 7. The Chief Commissioner desires to acknowledge the excellent work done by the two Deputy Superintendents, Rai Sahib Mohanlal at Jubbulpore and Kashinath Gopal at Nagpur, under the supervision of the Civil Surgeons of Jubbulpore and Nagpur, respectively. The Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Colonel Weir, has made frequent inspections of both Asylums. He presides over the Board of Visitors of the Takli Asylum and has paid special attention to that institution. ORDER.TABLE OF CONTENTS. Paras.

Officers in charge. The Nagpur Lunatic Asylum was in the charge of Lieutenant-Colonel J. L. Poynder from 1st January 1906, till 26th April, when he proceeded on leave after handing over to Lieutenant- Colonel A. Buchanan, who remained in charge till 14th January 1907, when Lieutenant-Colonel R. B. Roe succeeded him and continued in charge till the close of the triennium. At Jubbulpore, Major A. G. Hendley was in charge from 1st January till 7th March 1906, when he was relieved by Lieutenant- Colonel W. A. Quayle, who had returned from furlough. Lieutenant-Colonel Quayle held charge till 10th April 1908, except for the short period when he was absent on deputation, Major W. D. Sutherland then officiating (12-11-07 to 12-1-08): thereafter Lieutenant-Colonel A. Silcock assumed charge which he held up to the close of the year. STATEMENT I. Accommodntion and popu- lation. 2. The capacity of the Nagpur Asylum, which was 233 at the close of last triennium, is now 254: but the distribution has been changed, in consequence of the completion of the altera- tions undertaken in order to allow of the females from Jubbulpore being taken over, and it now holds 137 males and 117 females. There was accordingly some overcrowding on the male side in 1908, the largest number present on any night being 145 : but, as from 11 to 13 lunatics are not locked up, the overcrowding was really inappreciable. On the female side there is ample room: and when the additions that have been begun to accommodate the males on transfer from Jubbulpore have been completed there will be ample room on both sides of the Asylum. The slight overcrowding at Jubbulpore to the extent of 2 males and 1 female in 1907 and of 3 males in the first half of 1907, was completely got rid of by the transfer in July of all the females to Nagpur: and Jubbulpore has now room for 143 males, with only 99 to be housed. The additional accommodation provided on the female side at Nagpur in the course of the triennium consists of a barrack for 20 lunatics, a hospital with 8 beds and quarters for the matron. Admissions and re-admissions. 3. One hundred and forty-nine lunatics remained over at Nagpur at the close of last triennium, and 137 at Jubbulpore. At Nagpur there were 146 direct admissions in the 3 years under report (36 in 1906, 48 in 1907 and 62 in 1908) against 90 in the preceding three years (21, 26 and 43). The increase may have been connected with the recently prevailing scarcity. At Jubbulpore the admissions were 22 in 1906, 16 in 1907 and 27 in 1908, or 65 against 59 in the preceding triennium (14, 25 and 20). There were only 4 re-admissions against 17 in the preceding 3 years. Discharges. 4. The discharges were 55 at Nagpur (8, 18 and 29), against 63 in the the preceding triennium (20, 21 and 22): and their condition on discharge was 'cured'40, 'improved' 9, not improved ' 1, ' otherwise' 5 (4 escapes and 1 sent to stand his trial). This last should really have been classed as ' cured '. At Jubbulpore, the discharges num- bered 84 (13 in 1906, 50 in 1907 and 21 in 1908) against 55 (13, 21 and 21). 43 were discharged ' cured, '1 ' improved,' 2 were transferred from the criminal to the non-criminal side, 2 were escapes and 36 (females) were removed to Nagpur. Of the 4 escapes from Nagpur 2 simply walked away while working on the farm, the other two, criminals, one being fettered, escaped at night by removing tiles from the roof of the sleeping barrack. Both Jubbulpore escapes were effected by squeezing the body through the bars of the side openings. None of the escapes, except 1 at Jubbulpore, have yet been recaptured. With the exception of one dement all those discharged ' cured' had suffered from ' Mania.'
2 Sickness and mortality. 5. There were 200 admissions into hospital at Nagpur against 163 in the preceding three years: mostly for fevers, bronchitis, abscess, contused wound, epilepsy, anæmia, and old age with debility. There were 75 deaths, against 50 in the preceding period, 20 died of age and debility, ranging from 94 years of age down to 66, and after a residence in the asylum varying from 13 to 39 years. 20 died of epilepsy, 8 from anæmia and exhaustion. 4 from pneumonia, 3 from phthisis, 2 each from dysentery, dropsy and heart disease, and 1 each from tuberculosis, pulmonary gangrene, pericarditis, pleurisy, ague, arthritis, chronic Bright's disease, enlarged liver and spleen, sarcoma of breast, paralysis, asthma and intestinal parasites. There were two deaths from injury : in one case a female was stung by a swarm of bees that had been disturbed, in the other a criminal confined in a cell passed his arms through the bars and seizing a passing dement gouged out his eyes, fatal men- ingitis following. At Jubbulpore, there were 121 admissions into hospital against 196, and 22 deaths against 29. The deaths were due to old age (5), epilepsy (4), anæmia and debility (4), malarial cachexia (2), and heart disease, pneumonia, cerebral hæmorrhage, erysipelas, chronic Bright's disease, meningitis, and abscess of the abdominal wall. Of the deaths from old age one was 83 years of age and had been 29 years in the asylum, the other four were 70 years of age and had been inmates for 42, 37, 26 and 19 years, respectively. The two who died of anæmia and debility were habitual mud-eaters and difficultly fed. On the whole the health of the lunatics at Jubbulpore was good, at Nagpur not so good. The daily average of sick in Nagpur was in the three years of the triennium 6.66, 5.41, and 6.41, the rates per cent of population were 4025, 3.07, and 3.07. At Jubbulpore the daily sick averaged 2.66, 2.78, and 2.06, and the percentages on daily average strength were 1.87, 1.97, and 2.00. STATEMENT II. Criminal lunatics. 6. At Nagpur on 1st January 1906 there were 38 criminal lunatics under detention : 26 were admitted and re-admitted in the course of the triennium : 10 died, 7 were discharged (2 escapes, 1 transfer to non-criminal list, 1 transfer to jail and 3 sent to stand their trial): and 47 remained on the rolls at the close of 1908. At Jubbulpore, 36 re- mained : 15 were admitted : 5 died: 18 were discharged (5 to the non-criminal list, 5 sent up for trial, 2 transferred to jail, 1 cured and made over to his friends, 1 escaped, 4 transferred to Nagpur): and 28 remained on 31st December 1908. STATEMENT III. 7. Hindus formed 81.63 per cent of the admissions at Nagpur during the triennium, and 85.29 per cent at Jubbulpore: Muham- madans gave 12.93 per cent at the former and 8.82 at the latter asylum: 'other castes gave 3.40 and 4.41, and native christians 2.04 and 1.47, respectively. Males were 84.19 and females 15.81 of the admissions against 81.33 and 18.67 in the preceding triennium. STATEMENT IV. Religion and sex of those admitted. Occupation. 8. Beggars, labourers, cultivators and servants furnished the largest number of admissions. Those whose occupation could not be traced fell to 1, 1 and 2 in the three years. Great care is evidently being taken to ascertain complete particulars in the case of those sent to asylums. STATEMENT V. Age on admission. 9. As in the previous triennium, so in this, the majority of the admissions were in age between 20 and 40 years. This is the period of greatest activity of both body and mind, and the temp- tation to vicious excess of every sort is at its greatest, and the anxiety of family cares at its highest. Next comes the period between 40 and 60 years of age.
3 STATEMENT VI. Types of insanity. 10. As is usual, mania was the type most frequently present in those ad- mitted to the Provincial Asylums, this type existing in 90 per cent of the admissions in the triennium. Melan- cholia comes next, with 6.5 per cent : then idiocy with 2 per cent and dementia with 1.5 per cent. Of those ' cured ' and ' improved ' maniacs formed 93 per cent, and melancholics and dements 5 and 2 per cent, respectively. A case of de- lusional insanity transferred from Jubbulpore to Nagpur was reclassed as chronic mania. STATEMENT VII. Alleged causes of insanity. 11. Of the physical causes of insanity, ganja smoking was the most frequently found to cause admission, 67 having been admitted for this cause (45 at Nagpur and 22 at Jubbul- pore): heredity and congenital causes and secret vice account for 14, epilepsy and sunstroke for 18, spirit-drinking and fevers for 12 each, bhang and charas for 4, other intoxicants for 2 and all other physical causes for 18. Moral causes, such as religious impressions, grief for loss of friends, property, etc., sent 41 to the asylums. In the case of 27 the cause could not be ascertained. STATEMENT VIII. Finance. 12. At Nagpur the receipts from the Treasury increased considerably during the triennium, being Rs. 51,248-3-1 against Rs 38,535-12-1 in the preceding one. This was due to the increase in the number of inmates, and to the high prices prevailing for food stuffs, and to fall in receipts on account of paying patients, as the contribution towards the maintenance of Berar lunatics has now ceased. Expenditure at this asylum has increased under almost every heading. The appointment of a matron and the transfer of female warders from Jubbulpore and the grant of grain compensation to the servants increased the establishment charges by Rs. 4,448-12-1, the transfer of the female lunatics and the high price of food- grains increased the diet charges by Rs. 8,921-13-6, the high price of fodder raised the contingent expenses by Rs. 739-14-10, construction of new barracks, and of a hospital, a latrine and a cattle shed caused an increase on buildings of Rs. 11,988-7-10. There was a slight increase on account of English medi- cines bought, and also on 'rates and taxes', due to an increased supply of water from Ambajhiri reservoir, the air-motor not having worked satisfactorily. There has been an appreciable reduction in the expenditure on clothing and bedding, due no doubt to more careful supervision. At Jubbulpore, the receipts from Treasury increased by Rs. 3,653-2-1, due to high price of food-grains and to the grant of grain compensation to the establishment. Receipts from paying patients show an increase of Rs. 169-10-4 for the whole triennium, but in 1908 there was a large decrease owing to the transfer of the female paying patients to Nagpur, and for the same reason there has been a large fall in the value of stores supplied from the manufacturing department, as the females used to spin the wool from which the looms were supplied with yarn. Excepting establishment and dieting charges the expenditure under all other heads has been small. Incidence of expenditure. 13. The incidence of expenditure in 1908 in both asylums was Rs. 113, the highest recorded during the last six years, and due chiefly to increased diet charges. STATEMENT IX. Establishment. 14. The pay of the warders was improved in both asylums in the course of the triennium, and after the transfer of the females from Jubbulpore to Nagpur, a matron, an additional hospital assistant, two farm hands and two graziers were added to the establishment. Unfortunately it has not yet been possible to relieve the Deputy Superintendent of Nagpur Asylum of his medical duties.
4 STATEMENT X. Profit and Loss on man- ufacture. 15. The profits at the Nagpur Asylum have only been Rs. 10,433-2-7 against Rs. 15,251-4-8 in the previous triennium. This large decrease is mainly due to the dairy farm, which has not been working so profitably as formerly. The decrease was marked in 1908, owing to fodder having to be bought for the cattle at a very high rate. In Jubbulpore the profits remained stationary since 1904. There was a slight decrease in 1908, attributed to the smaller supply of clothing from the asylum to the lunatics and warders, and doubtless also to the transfer of the females to Nagpur and the lessened outturn of manufactures resulting. GENERAL REMARKS. Prophylactics. 16. Quinine in small doses was given daily to lunatics from July to Novem- ber, with the result of diminishing fever, and vegetables were freely issued so that scurvy is unknown in both asylums. Employment. 17. The chief occupation of the lunatics at Nagpur was employment on the farm, dairy and garden. A few were employed in cooking and weaving. The females were employed in cleaning and grinding corn. At Jubbulpore, gardening, cooking, weaving cloths and blankets formed the chiet occupations. Amusements. 18. In addition to the amusements mentioned in previous reports, the Superintendent of the Jubbulpore Asylum allowed the inmates to keep pet animals, as dogs, cats and parrots, and provided chausor and playing cards. At Nagpur, parrots, quail and pigeon were allowed as pets, and magic lantern and grammophone entertainments were given. A few of the more tractable patients were taken to see the Exhibition. Rewards. 19. The system of giving small money rewards to hardworking and deserv- ing well-behaved lunatics still continues, and is appreciat- ed, the money being generally expended in buying sweets. Inspections. 20. The Nagpur Asylum was visited by the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals three times specially, in addition to his visits as a member of the Board of Visitors. The Jubbulpore Asylum was visited as follows :STATISTICAL STATEMENTS. PAGE. STATEMENT No. I.2 STATE Showing the Admission, &c., of Lunatics in the Asylums in the Central 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Name of Asylum.

No. 609/VI-32-2. CENTRAL PROVINCES ADMINISTRATION. Medical Department. FROM F. L. CRAWFORD, ESQ., THIRD SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMOSSIONER, Central Provinces. To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, HOME DEPARTMENT. Nagpur, the 2nd May 1910, SIR, I am directed to submit herewith three copies of the Notes on the Annual Statements of the Lunatic Asylums in the Central Provinces for the year 1909, and to say that the work will be reviewed in due course when the Triennial Report for the year ending 1911 is dealt with. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, F. L. CRAWFORD Third Secretary. Govt. Press, Nagpur :-No. 432, Civil Sectt BRIEF NOTES TO ACCOMPANY THE ANNUAL STATEMENTS OF THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES FOR THE YEAR 1909. The additional accommodation required to allow the Nagpur Asylum to receive the remaining lunatics at Jubbulpore had been practically completed by the end of the year, and it is anticipated that the transfer will have been com- pleted and the Jubbulpore Asylum finally closed by the end of February 1910. Statement I. 2. Thirty-five males and 20 females were admitted, and 9 males were re- admitted into Nagpur Asylum during 1909, and 31 males were admitted into Jubbulpore Asylum (where only males were under treatment). The admissions were 7 less in Nagpur and 4 more in Jubbulpore than in the preceding year. The discharges from the former Asylum were 16 males and 2 females "cured", 12 males and 5 females trans- ferred to their friends "improved "and 1 female "not improved", and 22 males and 9 females " died ". At Jubbulpore the discharges "cured" numbered 16, 3 were transferred " improved " and 2 " died ". At the close of the year there remained at Nagpur 127 males and 72 females and at Jubbulpore 109 males. The daily average strength at Nagpur was 134.87 males and 71.81 females and at Jubbulpore 102.38 males, or for the Province 237.25 males and 71.81 females, in all 309.06. There was no overcrowding at Nagpur: at Jubbulpore the maximum on any one night rose to 110 on a capacity ot 109 (at 54 square feet per head). The daily average number sick was, at Nagpur, 2.14 males and 1.12 females and 1.32 males at Jubbulpore: these figures were2 Statement VIII. 8. The expenditure of the Nagpur and Jubbulpore Asylums was Rs. 64,093 and Rs. 12,039, respectively, and was met partly from (1) sale-proceeds of manufactured articles (Rs. 3,279), (2) sale of dairy farm produce (Rs. 4,776), (3) receipts realised from paying patients (Rs. 3,356), and partly from Government either in cash or by book adjustments. As compared with the previous year there was an increase of Rs. 14,699 in the total expenditure, due chiefly to the construction of additional buildings at Nagpur Asylum to accommodate lunatics from Jubbulpore Asylum. The average cost per head in Nagpur was Rs. 133, or Rs. 15 more than in the previous year, while in Jubbulpore it was Rs. 99 per head, or Rs. 14 less than that of 1908. The increase at Nagpur was chiefly due to increase in diet charges owing to high price of food grains, &c. At Jubbulpore it was due to the smaller average strength. Statement X. 9. The dairy farm at Nagpur Asylum has continued to work satisfactorily. It supplies the wants not only of the inmates of the Asylum but also to a large extent of the public. The attached farm has also proved a profitable success. During the year there was a profit on account of manufactures of Rs. 2,100 in the Nagpur and Rs. 615 in the Jubbulpore Asylum, against Rs. 2,341 and Rs. 997, respectively, in 1908. The profits at Nagpur are mainly derived from the farm and attached dairy. NAGPUR: P. A. WEIR, M.B., COL., I. M. S., Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Central Provinces. The 1st March 1910.
