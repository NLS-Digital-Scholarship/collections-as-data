Remarks by the Hon'ble the Agent to the Governor General, Raj- putana and Chief Commissioner, Ajmer-Merwara. The year under report has been marked by a deficiency of rainfall and an abnormally high death-rate owing to an outbreak of influenza of a very virulent type. On the other hand there was a marked decrease in the mortality from plague, there being 16,268 deaths in the whole of Rajputana, including Ajmer-Merwara, against 98,192 deaths in the preceding year. As regards Sanitation, the condition of Ajmer City is still indifferent and the interior portion of the town is in urgent need of improvement. This question continues to engage the attention of the authorities but owing to the congested nature of the town it is a very difficult one to deal with. Vaccination did not show any satisfactory progress during the year owing largely to the influenza epidemic. The charge of the post of Chief Medical Officer in Rajputana has been assumed by Colonel Haig, to whom and to whose predecessor (Colonel Macwatt) as well to the other medical officers in Rajputana my thanks are due for the energy and ability with which they have carried out their duties in an exceptionally trying year. End.REPORT ON SANITATION, DISPENSARIES, AND JAILS IN RAJPUTANA FOR 1918 AND ON VACCINATION FOR THE YEAR 1918-19. SECTION I.2 VITAL STATISTICS, NOTE ON INFLUENZA EPIDEMIC IN RAJPUTANA. 10. In Ajmer-Merwara, the death rate during the epidemic is shown in the accompanying table. 11. The chart shows the daily death rate in Ajmer City during the epidemic. 12. Such preventive measures as were possible were adopted. 13. In Ajmer all schools and colleges were closed. 14. General instructions were issued as to the avoidance of infection, and simple methods of treatment were described. 15. The Municipality opened a camp for patients, and made arrange- ments for the free distribution of milk and medicines to the sick. 16. The Sewa Samity gave assistance in the treatment of patients and disposal of dead bodies. 17. A travelling dispensary was instituted. 18. Owing to war conditions and the failure of the Monsoon, there was general scarcity and the prices of food and clothing were high. 19. It is probable that owing to the privations so caused, the population was generally in a reduced state of health and specially liable to fall victims of an epidemic. 20. Smallpox was not prevalent in the district during 1918, the reported deaths from it were only 27 against 1,275 in the previous year. 21. The percentage of male to female deaths was 98.43 against 99.77 in 1917.

These carts convey their loads up hill to the steam tramway station where their contents are transferred to the tramway trucks and taken out to the trenching ground. 33. Much manual labour is required by this system and as the sweeper class has of recent years diminished in numbers, the supply of labour is deficient. 34. The Municipal carts for removing sewage, foul water, etc., are too few and are in bad repair. Owing to high prices and scarcity of material, renewals and repairs have fallen seriously behind hand. A large sum should be devoted to remedy this. 35. Most of the streets in the city are rough and unpaved, so the wear and tear on the carts is great. 36. The covered drains in the city are very foul and are never emptied. 37. Latrines, both public and private, are generally in bad condition. The use of galvanised iron for latrines receptacles was ordained some time ago, but recently it has been practically impossible to get galvanised iron for renewals. 38. Ajmer is expanding, the growth is taking place to a considerable extent in the low lying area remote from the Conservancy tramway. In most of the low lying area the sanitary condition is very bad, and the expense of a thorough removal of sewage, etc., by carting it up hill to the Tramway would be enormous. 39. The question of conservancy requires review and consideration. I am of opinion that a system of surface drainage must be adopted sooner or later. The land fall is suitable for this, and it would reduce the amount of expensive carting which is now done, and also diminish the manual labour of the sweepers. 40. A slaughter house built on modern lines is needed. 41. Many of the shops in the city, especially meat and halwai shops, use no means to protect their wares from flies and dust. The effect of this on the general health of the city is bad. Village Sanitation, Ajmer-Merwara. 42. The Commissioner, Ajmer-Merwara, reports that the rules for the improvement of village sanitation were restricted to the villages noted in the margin as last year. Aimer Sub-Division. 1. Pushkar. 2.

It was proposed to construct a pucca platform 77'+18' at Depôt No. 4 Chaukri Ghât Gate to facilitate removal of rubbish that was being collected there and the work was taken in hand. 49. Sixty-three latrines were newly constructed and 328 old latrines were repaired. 50. Jaipur has an excellent drinking water-supply obtained from the series of wells in a river bed and pumped through pipes to the city; there is also a good well water supply which is carefully supervised. 51. Jodhpur.8 VACCINATION AND DISPENSARIES IN RAJPUTANA. General operations in Native States. 65. The vaccination returns from the Native States show a considerable decrease under all heads due to the severe epidemic of Influenza throughout Rajpu- tana during the season. The total number of Primary Vaccinations in Native States was 150,923 of which 144,916 were successful as compared with 190,290 Primary and 184,179 successful operations in 1917-1918. Re-vacci- nation rose from 228 in 1917-1918 to 1,181 in the year under report. No vaccination was done in Jaisalmer during the season owing to the prevalence of Influenza and Famine. 66. There were 161. vaccinators against 163 vaccinators in 1917-1918, 1 less in Kotah and Banswara, respectively. 67. As vaccinations were performed entirely by the Sub-Assistant Surgeons attached to the Agency Hospital, Deoli, no vaccinator was employed in Deoli Cantonment during the season. 68. 13.73 per thousand of the population in the Native States were successfully vaccinated against 17.47 in 1917-1918. STATEMENT II. Expenditure on vaccination in Ajmer-Merwara. 69. The total expenditure on vaccination in Ajmer-Merwara was R3,240-11-4 against R3,181-15-4 in 1917- 1918, an increase of R58-12-0 due to increased pay. Expenditure on vaccination in Native States. 70. The total expenditure in Native States was R33,808-0-3 as compared with R34,919-15-1 in the previous season, the decrease in cost being due chiefly to pay and travelling allowances to vaccination staff. The average cost of each successful vaccination was in different States varied from 21 pies in Kotah to 87 pies in Marwar. 71. The following table shows the number of towns and villages inspect- ed and vaccination seen by Residency or Agency Surgeons in Native States :DISPENSARIES IN RAJPUTANA. 9 less as compared with the previous year. The Railway Dispensary at Marwar Junction in Marwar was closed on 1st February and the Southern Rajputana States Agency Hospital at Neemuch temporarily on 29th June 1918, during the absence of the Political Agency. The Masuda Dispensary in Ajmer District was opened on 5th February 1918. The Government Charitable Dispensary at Abu Road was handed over to the Sirohi State from the 6th May 1918. 76. The dispensaries are classified as under :10 DISPENSARIES IN RAJPUTANA. previous year. The difference of 188 patients between columns 8 and 53 of Statements B and C(i) respectively is due to 188 out-door Labour cases being included in Statement C(i). 89. 130 Normal confinements with 2 deaths and 181 abnormal confine- ments with 3 deaths were reported from various hospitals, against 146 with no deaths and 155 with 6 deaths respectively in 1917. 90. 1,532,586 out-door patients treated in 1918 are shown in Statement C(ii) against 1,843,262 in 1917. 91. The cases treated in the hospitals and dispensaries under each chief disease during the years 1916, 1917 and 1918 are as follows :DISPENSARIES IN RAJPUTANA. 11 Plague. 96. During the year from 1st April 1918 to 31st March 1919, 18,972 plague seizures and 16,268 deaths were reported in 667 towns and villages infected in Ajmer-Merwara District and in the Native States in Rajputana as compared with 116,168 plague cases an d 98,192 deaths in 2,101 towns and villages in 1917-1918. 97. The percentage of total plague deaths to population was 2.41 as shown in table attached as compared with 2.26 in the previous year. 98. 3,572 anti-plague inoculations were performed during the year under report at the following places :12 PLAGUE IN RAJPUTANA. 63 cases and 53 deaths in Ratangarh, 60 cases and 56 deaths in Sujangarh, 13 cases and 9 deaths at Kanota village and 2 cases with 1 death in Surat- grah. 109. Bharatpur. The last year's epidemic of plague extended to the first three months of the year, viz., April to June in 140 towns and villages but it re-appeared in the month of January 1919, in village Jodhpur in Pahari Tehsil whence it spread to 4 other villages. It is still in existence. 4,260 cases and 3,383 deaths were reported ; of these 36 cases with 23 deaths occurred in Bharatpur City. 110. Dholpur.DISPENSARIES IN RAJPUTANA. 13 125. The following shows the classes of patients treated in 1917 and 1918:14 DISPENSARIES IN RAJPUTANA. 136. The total income of the hospitals and dispensaries in Ajmer-Merwara was R30,610 as compared with R25,538 in 1917, an increase of R5,072 which is due chiefly to the grant of (1) R1,040 by the District Board, Ajmer-Merwara, for additions and alterations to Sub-Assistant Surgeon's quarters at Todgarh, (2) R2,095 on account of interest on the investment of R620,000 on behalf of the Masuda Dispensary which was opened on 5th February 1918, and (3) certain other subscriptions. The subscriptions from Indians rose from R2,892 in 1917 to R3,916. 137. The invested capital of the dispensaries in this Division rose from R8,500 to R28,500 as R20,000 were invested for the maintenance of the Dispensary at Masuda. As the amount of R20,000 was invested in 1916 on behalf of the Masuda Dispensary which was opened on 5th February 1918 as contribution from the Masuda Estate, it has now been shown in column 4 of Statement J. 138. The investment of R6,000 formerly shown in this Statement against Ajmer included R1,500 in favour of Todgarh Dispensary which has now been shown separately under proper heading. It is not a new investment and no deposits were withdrawn. 139. The total expenditure of the Ajmer-Merwara dispensaries rose from R22,929 in 1917 to R28,247 in 1918, an increase of R5,318 under all heads of expenditure except buildings and repairs. This increase in expenditure is attri- buted to increased cost of drugs, diets and materials owing to the war. 140.
