Proceedings of the Hon'ble the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab, in the Revenue and Agriculture (General) Department, No. 647 S, dated 19th August 1895. READNo. 1370, dated 17th July 1895. From2 The number of foals obtained is said to be 553, giving an average of 36.52 per 100 mares covered, and 10.84 foals per stallion at work. The results of 369 coverings are not known. In the districts of the North Punjab Circle there were 2 horse stallions and 22 pony stallions at work at the close of the year, against a total of 16 at the close of the previous year, a net increase of 8. Only one animal has been re- moved from the register, which died at Kohát. The additions were made as follows:3 It is quite impossible for the ordinary district returns of horses and ponies to say what are, and what are not, suitable for breeding purposes, and it seems to me useless to expect it. It is also not quite clear from whence these figures were obtained. Mr. Cranford in para. 12 blames district authorities for their incompleteness, but so far District Officers have not been authorized to call upon the subordinate Revenue staff for special returns of unbranded mares, with the exception of those covered by Imperial horse and donkey stallions. It was strongly represented to Government that the district staff should not be called upon for returns of this nature at present, but that the figures supplied should be con- fined to branded mares, and the Local Government concurred with these representations. The remarks of Mr. Cranford in para. 12, therefore, appear to be made under a misapprehension. Mule-breeding. 5. As regards mule-breeding, there is not very much to note. Four donkey stallions were employed in the Southern Punjab Circle, and 233 mares were covered against 175 last year. This gives 58.25 per stallion against 43.75 last year. The demand for donkey stallions is very small. There are no donkey stallions belonging to District Boards in the North Punjab, and only 1 in the Deraját. Only 25 mules are reported to have been foaled, but the returns are incomplete, none having been received from Hissár. Cattledisease. 6. As regards cattle disease, the remarks made are taken entirely from the weekly police returns and monthly district returns. In the report over 20,000 animals are said to have died from rinderpest in Ferozepore, and most other forms of cattle disease appear to have been much more rife in Ferozepore than elsewhere, but there is no doubt that the figures on these points are quite unreliable. An enquiry will be made however, into the alleged unusual prevalence of disease in Ferozepore during the past year. The report is unnecessarily long and prolix on this subject, seeing that it is not made from personal observation, but simply on figures admittedly inaccurate. Cattle Fairs. 7. Mr. Cranford visited 6 Cattle Fairs and gives a brief report on each. No Cattle Fairs were attended by Superintendents, North Punjab or Deraját. Mr. Cranford now expresses an opinion less favourable to the Hissár bulls than the one he previously entertained, considering them too big and cumbersome; and recommends that bulls of other breeds should be also employed. This subject will receive special consideration by Veterinary Captain Pease, Assistant Inspector-General, Civil Veterinary Department, during his approaching tour in the Province, and will be duly reported on at its conclusion. Mr. Cranford, Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, South Punjab, states that his attendance at Cattle Fairs seriously interferes with his other duties in connection with horse-breeding. This will receive due consideration by the Inspector-General, Civil Veterinary Department, and myself, and it may be found possible to reduce the number of Cattle Fairs at which his presence is required. It is to be hoped that a depôt for Punjab stallions will before long be established within the Province. Veterinary Dispensaries. 8. Separate notices are given by Superintendent, South Punjab, of Veterinary dispensaries established at Amritsar, Hoshiár- pur, Umballa, Jallálabad and Rohtak. The figures given for these dispensaries are somewhat doubtful, but there is no doubt that all are doing good work. The only Veterinary dispensary in the Northern Circle is that at Siálkot, which has also worked well. Veterinary dispensaries are now established at the following places:- Umballa, Amritsar, Hoshiárpur, Jal- lálabad (Ferozepore district), Rohtak, Delhi, Gurgáon, Multan Gurdáspur, Siálkot, Ráwalpindi, Gujrát, Gujránwála, Sháhpur, Dera Gházi Khan and Dera Ismáil Khan.
4 Subordinate Veterinary establishments. 9. I have arranged that the subordinate District Veterinary estab- lishments should be placed at the disposal of the Superintendents, Civil Veterinary Department, when these officers tour through the districts in which they are employed, and this gives an opportunity of testing the knowledge and capacity of these men, and, in a minor degree, the work done by them. The necessity for more supervision over these Veterinary Assistants has long been felt. I have arranged that they shall all be placed at the disposal of the Assistant Inspector-General, Civil Veterinary Department, while he is on tour next winter in the Punjab in their respective districts, and at the conclusion of that tour I purpose to discuss the whole question with Veterinary Captain Pease, and then to take such further action as may be necessary. Gelding. 10. The castration of colts has been making steady progress, and this will probably have an excellent effect in improving the breed of horses and ponies. The total number castrated in the Province was 1,133. Out of 361 cases in the South Punjab only two deaths were reported. In some cases energy seems to have been unnecessarily expended in the castration of mules. Touring. 11. The Superintendents, Civil Veterinary Department, did much tour- ing, and worked with energy and success. Veterinary Lieutenant Cranford wrote his report while still ill and recovering from typhoid fever. Cost to Provincial Reve- nues. 12, The cost of the three Circles to the Provincial Revenues was as follows:5 TABLE A.6 TABLE D.7 TABLE F.8 TABLE J.9 TABLE K.10 TABLE M.11 TABLE N.12 TABLE O.13 TABLE P.14 No. 416/27, dated 24th June 1895. From15 This view of the case of course is quite opposed to the idea that District Board stallions are maintained with the object of assisting imperial horse- breeding. Twelve horses in Umballa district were transferred to the head of pony stallions. Number present at close of year. 4. Thirty-three horses and 23 ponies were present at the close of the year, and they were distributed as follows:16 In Mooltan several good Arab stallions are, I consider, urgently required, one at least for each tahsíl. At present the District Board own one, and arrangements are now being made with this Department, I believe, for the purchase of another. Here, too, I am of opinion that there should be a stallion for each tahsíl; when touring through the district last cold weather I noticed that there were a large number of pony mares such as would mate well with these animals. My object in advocating the introduction of several District Board stallions to this district is, that I believe that they would in some way help to revive the interest which used to be taken in horse-breeding some years ago, and which latterly, I regret to say, has assumed a backward tendency. In Hissár where the District Board horses are most popular, 5 horses have served an average of 62 mares each; I believe the Deputy Commissioner intends obtaining another horse next purchasing season. Here, too, 4 ponies, also the property of District Board, covered 41 mares each. These figures are decidedly encouraging. In Karnál district there are two stallions owned by the District Board: this number might at least be increased by one horse. There ought to be room for one horse in each tahsíl. Cost of feed and keep, and how defrayed. 8. The total cost of feed, keep and attendance, &c., were Rs. 5,299-4-10 and Rs. 2,322-5-4 for horse and pony stallions, respectively, against Rs. 4,365-14-3 and Rs. 1,406-5-8 last year, showing an increase of Rs. 933-6-7 and Rs. 915-15-8 under head of horse and pony stallions, respectively. This increased cost is due to the larger number of stallions present. The average cost per horse stallion was Rs. 232-12-6 per annum against Rs. 246-7-9 last year, showing a decrease of Rs. 13-11-3 per horse. Per pony stallion the average cost is Rs. 166-8-0 against Rs. 160-14-8, showing an increase of Rs. 5-9-4. The highest average took place in Ferozepore district, the lowest in Gurdáspur district. The expenses of feed and keep were defrayed by District Boards and Municipalities and in certain cases by Court of Wards and private individuals. The average cost in each district is given in Table E. 2.17 I need scarcely point out that as Table F is incomplete by three or four districts, and that in other cases it is quite apparent that the numbers given are incorrect, that the total of mares shown as present at the. close of the year, viz., 18,437, is not to be relied on, and until District Officers make it their business to insist on more care being exercised, with reference to these annual returns, we cannot arrive at any satisfactory conclusions as regards the number of mares (other than branded mares) present in this Circle. I consider the time has arrived when the attention of the District Officers should be called to this matter, and in future that more care should be exercised in the compilation of these returns ; this is the second year under report, and it is time that a little more interest on the subject was exacted. Number covered by dis- trict stallions. 13. One thousand two hundred and nine mares were covered by horse stallions and 830 by pony stallions, making a total of 2,039 mares, against 1,514 last year, showing an increase of 525 mares. 3.18 Number of pony and donkey mares covered. 20. Two hundred and thirty-three mares were covered altogether against 175 last year. The average number covered per stallion being 58.25 against 43.75 in the previous year. The stallion in the Mooltan district covers both pony and donkey mares, but the services of the other three animals were confined to pony mares. Demand for stallions. 21. The demand for donkey stallions is very small, and mule-breeding from a District Board point of view makes very slow pro- gress. There are, however, one or two districts in which Stallions are required. One, I believe, is wanted in Hissár district, and will probably be obtained next purchasing season. Two or three are also wanted for Ludhiána district, where there is a very large number of pony mares, and where, judging from reports received from time to time, mule-breeding is capable of great extension. During the past year, however, great difficulty has been experienced in obtaining donkey sires. I do not consider it advisable for District Board to invest in European donkeys, and at present the supply of country-bred donkeys which are fitted for breeding purposes is limited. Cost of feed and keep, and how defrayed. 22. The cost of feed and keep, &c., was Rs. 494-14-8 for all the stallions against Rs. 516-3-5 last year. The average cost per stallion per annum being Rs. 127-2-0 against Rs. 116-14-1 last year. 2.19 Umballa and Montgomery districts according to returns were quite free from the disease; this, however, is very doubtful. The disease was prevalent in 7 other districts, but I am informed the figures given are inconsistent with facts. Foot and mouth disease. 29. The number of deaths under this heading was small, Rohtak is said to have escaped altogether: seeing that foot and mouth disease is an affection generally prevalent in all the dis- tricts of this Circle, it is strange that there should have been no record of any case in that district during the past 12 months. In Ferozepore 2,100,756 animals were attacked, of which nearly 3,000 died. In Amritsar the losses from it were few. Pleuro-pneumonia. 30. The losses from pleuro-pneumonia were very few; over 138,000 were attacked in Ferozepore, of which about 5,000 succumbed: with the exception of Gurdáspur district, the number of seizures are hardly worth recording. In the latter 131 deaths occurred from the affection, no cases were reported from Rohtak, Umballa and Montgomery. Charbon symptomatique. 31. The only reports of the disease were received from Montgomery and Gurdáspur, and only 12 deaths are shown altogether, these being the only districts according to return in which the disease appeared. Other diseases. 32. Further deaths other than contagious occurred in the Ferozepore district to the number of 17,000. The number given in all other districts are very small, probably due to a very large number of cases not being reported. Casualty. 33. During the year the loss from cattle disease was according to returns received over 57,000 in Ferozepore district, over 3,000 and 2,000 in Amritsar and Hissár respectively, and other districts less in number. I feel satisfied that these figures do not repre- sent anything like the losses incurred. Returns from Simla and Karnál districts were sent in blank, but it is presumed that cattle disease does exist in these districts as in others. This is the first year that Table M has been introduced, which may account for discrepancies, but a glance at the figures will, I think, show them to be incorrect. In the column of totals only 115 deaths from disease are shown to have taken place in Rohtak district, in Kángra 170, in Mooltan only 349, and Mont- gomery 235. Further steps certainly ought to be taken to check the frightful losses from disease among cattle in Ferozepore district. Treatment. 34. Treatment is carried out by the district salotri in the villages of the different tahsíls, in most districts a supply of medi- cines being kept at each tahsíl in charge of the Tahsíldár as well as at the different dispensaries. IV.20 Cattle Fairs. Cattle fairs. 36. I personally attended the following Cattle Fairs:21 The cattle were a better lot than those seen at Sirsa. I might mention that 30 very smart bullocks were obtained by Captain Hamilton, Commissariat Department. The sanitary arrangements were roughly carried out as at the show at Sirsa. The droppings were cleared daily by sweepers, but the whole ground was not properly cleared until the conclusion of the fair. Arrangements for watering of animals were satisfactory, an ample supply of water being obtained from two wells on the fair ground. There were four salotrís out of five from the tahsíls of the district who carried out the inspection of the animals. A piece of ground had been fenced in about a quarter of a mile from the show, as a temporary Veterinary Hospital. At the time of my inspection there were about 15 animals isolated there, all of which showed the feet and mouth to be affected, although some had almost recovered. Treatment consisted of isola- tion from the healthy cattle and dressing with alum lotion. A supply of medicines was ready at hand on the ground which was drawn from the reserve supply usually kept in each tahsíl of the district. Lndhiána Chaitchow- dus Cattle Fair. 41. This cattle fair was attended on 23rd March 1895. About 3,800 cattle attended the fair. The cattle generally were in worse condition than any other cattle fair I have attended; this cannot be said to be due to want of fodder, &c., but must be the result of neglect. The breeds of cattle were:22 V.23 at, the villages they visit, the class of animals treated, nature of disease, treat- ment, and esults. Their visit at different villages, &c., are verified by lambar- dárs, zaildárs, &c. Last year the salotrís of one district only were sending monthly returns to me, at the time of annual report, since then the form in use in that district has been slightly modified and made applicable to all districts in this Circle. During the past year at my suggestion the Deputy Commissioners in some districts have put the District Board stallions in charge of the salotrís, under supervision of the Tahsíldárs, each salotri being answerable for any horses of this class standing in his tahsíl. In this way they are induced to take an interest in District Board horse- breeding generally, which is very desirable. I hope in time to get this system adopted in every district. As regards the number of colts castrated by these men, according to returns, there has been a satisfactory increase. In the Ferozepore district the number given is 103, in Mooltan 76; if cas- tration were carried out in every district to this extent we should soon make headway. Last year the total number of horse stock gelded was 208 against 361 this year. Out of this number only two deaths are reported from effects of operation. In Montgomery nothing has been done, but this is owing to the fact that there are no District Board salotrís. Doubtless the proposal which is becoming general in the districts to pay Rs. 5 to the owners of animals to have their colts gelt and Re. 1 to each salotri for every animal he castrates will have a beneficial effect.

TABLE N.32 SOUTH PUNJAB. TABLE O.33 SOUTH PUNJAB. TABLE P.34 No. 150/29, dated 15th June 1895. From35 8. Out of the 19 mentioned as being employed at stud work, one horse stallion belonging to District Board, Kohát, died on 1st November 1894, conse- quently his services were only available for part of the year. Average number of mares covered per stallion. 9. The general average of mares covered per stallion is 45.78 as against 26.66 the previous year. 10. This average is only calculated from the 19 stallions working throughout the year, the five stallions purchased at close of year not being included. The marked increase is partly due to the fact that the average of the whole of the stallions of the previous year was taken, whether working through- out the year or not. Demand of stallions. 11. From the experience gathered during my last cold weather tour, I am inclined to think that pony stallions might be placed with great advantage in the following districts:36 Number covered by dis- trict stallions. 17. One hundred and fifteen mares were covered by district horse stal- lions as against 142 last year, the decrease being partly due to the horse at Kohát having died early in the year, thereby leaving only 2 to continue the covering. 18. Seven hundred and fifty-five mares were covered by pony stallions as against 258 last year, the increase is due to the greater number of stallions employed at the stud and also to the fact that they worked throughout the year. 3.37 29. The returns from Kohát and Pesháwar have been returned blank, though outbreaks have been reported from time to time from each district, such being the case the accuracy of the returns is not to be relied upon. Treatment. 30. The investigation of outbreaks and the treatment of cases is at present entirely confined to Veterinary Assistants who keep diaries of such investigations and treatment which are inspected by me while on tour. A Table N showing number of animals treated is attached. IV.38 Miles travelled. 39. During the year under report my predecessor, Veterinary Lieuten- ant Drage, travelled 799 miles by road and 3,475 by rail. I travelled 1,289 miles by road and 3,025 by rail. VII.39 NORTH PUNJAB.

Proceedings of the Hon'ble the Lieuntenant-Governor of the Punjab, in the Revenue and Agricultural (general) Department, No. 625 S., dated Simla, 8th August 1896. READ 2 8. In Table Q the cost to Provincial Funds of the Civil Veterinary Department for the year under report is shown as Rs. 28,909-11-11. This is an increase of Rs. 10,472-1-4 as compared with the total Provincial expenditure last year. But almost Rs. 8,000 of this increase are due to an item which appears for the first time in the accounts for the South Punjab under the head Establish- mentNo. 1336, dated 13th July 1896. From2 The number of foals dropped by the 2,039 mares covered by district stallions was reported to be 827, giving an average of 40.55 to mares covered and 16.21 per stallion employed. This is very satisfactory and far better than the returns for Imperial stallions. In the case of branded mares covered by Imperial stallions (para. 27 of Imperial Report) 2,249 mares dropped 612 foals only, giving an average of 27.21 per cent., and 12 per stallion employed. These figures are curious and give food for reflection. I do not pretend to be able to give a full explanation off-hand without further enquiry, but I have no doubt that the explanation is partly to be found in the fact that zamíndárs are not always anxious to declare the birth of a foal by a branded mare owing to a belief that they may be called on to produce it for inspection or even enforced sale, whereas the services of District Board stallions being quite free, the people are much less suspicious and have much less hesitation in announcing that their mares have had foals. It is notorious that a large portion of the remounts annually purchased are by Imperial stallions, but only a little over a fifth are of known pedigree. It is well known that elaborate systems of supervision, inspection, certificates, brands, registers and so on, however necessary they may be to the preparation of statistics, frighten the people and render them suspi- cious. Our policy should be to reduce restrictions and registration to its lowest possible limits. The Superintendent suggests that District Boards' salutries should keep registers of coverings and produce of District Board stallions and submit a monthly report to the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, as the Imperial zilladárs do. I do not recommend this. In the first place, I do not wish to see district salutries taken up too much with horse breeding, and I do not consider that the zilladárs figures have been so reliable in the past that there is anything to be gained by copying their system. Turning to the report of the Superintendent, North Punjab, we find3 Cost of feed and keep. 4. The average cost of feed and keep for horse and pony stallions was as follows:4 "received practically blank. In addition to this the districts of Dera Ismail Khan and "Bannu have been added to my circle. I am of opinion that cattle disease in various "form, has decreased in the districts of Gujrát and Gujránwála where there were last year "large outbreaks of 'foot-and-mouth' disease. The figures do not show this, the reason "being probably that more correct information has been received." There were outbreaks of rinderpest in the Shahpur district, and in Umballa, Jullundur, Ferozepore and Mooltan, and it was also prevalent in parts of Lahore and Gujrát and present to a small extent in several others. In case of an outbreak, the Veterinary Assistant was at once despatched to assist in sup- pressing the disease by advice as to segregation, disinfection and so on, but it is remarked that there is great difficulty sometimes experienced in getting the people to abandon old habits which stand in the way. Anthrax appeared in Umballa, Amritsar and Jullundur, and foot-and- mouth disease appeared in twelve districts. Pleuro-pneumonia was not common during the year. Umballa suffered most from various forms of cattle disease. IV.--CATTLE-BREEDING INCLUDING CATTLE FAIRS AND SHOWS. 8. As regards Cattle Fairs and Shows, the Superintendent, North Pun- jab, has no Cattle Fairs in his Circle and does not mention the subject, and the Superintendent Civil Veterinary Department, South Punjab, remarks that bis time was so completely taken up with horse-breeding that he had absolutely no time to give to this subject of cattle or cattle breeding. V.5 All these dispensaries were inspected at least once during the year and were found to be doing excellent work. With the exception of Rohtak, each dispensary has a hospital attached. At Rohtak animals are merely brought in and treated. A dispensary will shortly be opened in Ludhiána. These institutions are doing much good work, and they are very useful for the training of District Veterinary Assistants who are placed in charge in rotation. In addi- tion to these there are medical stores at Gujránwála, Dera Ismail Khan and Shahpur. Work done by subordi- nate establishment. 10. As regards the work done by the subordinate Veterinary establish- ment, the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, South Punjab, considers that great improvement has taken place. The Superintendent, North Punjab, does not report so favorably. The necessity for more continuous and systematic supervision is very strongly felt, and it is hoped that the arrangements now in contemplation will eventually supply this. My own opinion is, however, that even with the appointment of a Senior Veterinary Assistant for each Division matters will not be placed on a satisfactory basis until a third Veterinary Superintendent is appointed for the Province whose time will not be entirely taken up with horse-breeding, but who will be able to devote himself mainly to questions connected with cattle and the continuous training and supervision of the subordinate Veterinary establishment. This is a matter of the utmost importance, and in the interest of the Punjab agriculturists such an appointment should, I think, be made as speedily as may be found possible. Castration of colts. 11. There has been a satisfactory increase in the number of castrations of colts performed during the year, i.e., 1,444, against 1,133 last year. The increase was almost entirely in the South Punjab where the figures were 643, against 341. In Ferozepore District alone there were 243, of which 118 were performed by the Veterinary Assistant in charge of the Jalálábad dispensary. Castration has become very common in Dera Gházi Khan and is making progress throughout the Province. There can be no doubt that the gelding of inferior stallions is essential to any improve- ment in the breed. There were very few casualties. VI.6 The report of the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, South Punjab, was received in my office on 10th June 1896, and that of the Superin- tendent, Civil Veterinary Department, North Punjab, on 17th June 1896. Veterinary Captain H. T. Pease was employed in the Punjab for several months, investigating Cattle disease, Cattle breeding and the work of the Sub- ordinate Civil Veterinary Department. I have just received a copy of a most interesting report on his work. This has, however, been treated as part of the Imperial Report and, accordingly, I do not propose to refer to it further here. The many important questions dealt with in it, which are connected with this Province, will be disposed of separately when the printed Report is received from the Inspector-General, Civil Veterinary Department.

Proceedings of the Hon'ble the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab, in the Revenue and Agricultural (General) Department, No. 989 S., dated 4th August 1897. READ( 2 ) report referred to above drew attention to the evils resulting from the practice of turning loose inferior bulls as "pun". At the request of Government the Director of Land Records has submitted a separate report as to the practicability of doing anything to regulate the custom. 6. A new cattle dispensary was opened at Ludhiana which met with a great measure of support. The attendance at the Rohtak dispensary which showed a large increase last year has again fallen, but with the exception of Hoshiarpur it is the only place where the attendance has not increased. 7. Table N. includes work done at 9 itinerant dispensaries and 3 medical stores as well as at the 7 regular dispensaries. It should have been prepared in the new form sanctioned in Punjab Government No. 800, dated 5th November 1896. 8. In consequence of the remarks in paragraph 7 of last year's Review Table L. has been enlarged to show castrations performed by Imperial salutris. This gives a truer idea of what is being done in this way, but the figures for the South Punjab Circle would be more useful if details were given by districts. 9. The cost to Provincial revenues of the Civil Veterinary Department was Rs. 2,085 less than last year, chiefly due to decrease in travelling allowance drawn. 10. Proposals for extra clerks for the offices of the Superintendents, Civil Veterinary Department, North and South Punjab, were submitted last year and disallowed. They have been resubmitted with further particulars and the matter is under consideration. It. The Lieutenant-Governor is glad to see that Veterinary-Captain Joslen, Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, South Punjab, was able to do so much in the way of inspecting Veterinary Assistants and cattle dispen- saries. ORDER.No. 1386, dated 8th July 1897. From2 Forty-one horses and 25 ponies were at stud work during the year. They covered 3,293 mares, viz., 2,270 covered by horses and 1,023 by ponies against 3,470 in the previous year. The decrease in coverings is attributed to the general scarcity of fodder and the poor condition of the animals. The average number of mares covered per stallion was 55.36 per horse and 40.92 per pony, a falling-off from last year when the corresponding figures were 60.42 and 58.70. The Superintendent remarks that more pony stallions could be usefully employed in Jullundur, Dera Gházi Khan, Mooltan and Gurdáspur. None of these districts has at present any pony stallions, but the Superintendent states that the District Board, Jullundur, has recently purchased one at a small price. In this district and Dera Gházi Khan there appear to be a good many mares, too small for branding, but suitable for good pony stallions. Generally speaking, Gurgáon, Delhi, Kángra, Montgomery and Jullundur have done least to develope horse-breeding by providing horse or pony stallions. Kángra has no Imperial stallion, Delhi has only one, Jullundur only two, and the District Boards of these districts have therefore all the wider field for their operations, and their responsibility to do something for horse-breeding is all the greater. There is no district in the Province, I think, where District Board horse or pony stallions could not be usefully employed. The number of foals dropped by the 3,470 mares covered by District stallions in the previous year was reported to be 818, giving an average of 23.57 per 100 mares covered, and 14.10 per stallion employed. This result is less satisfactory than last year's, when the average was 40.55 foals per 100 mares covered, and 1621 per stallion employed. No doubt the year was unfavourable for breeding, as mares were much reduced in condition by the scarcity of forage, and many were probably sold or sent away and lost sight of, but the figures are not complete, no returns having been received from one tahsíl in Gurgáon, and as regards 254 mares in Amritsar and Dera Gházi Khan. From the report of the Superintendent, North Punjab, we find that at the beginning of the year there were 2 horse and 29 pony stallions in that circle. Four horse stallions were added during the year3 in the previous year. The average number of coverings per horse was 43.33 against 60.50 in the previous year, and per pony 60.70 against 57.59, the general average 57.54 being practically the same as in the previous year and much better than in the South Punjab. The number of coverings by horse stallions would have been more, had not the 3 new sires been purchased after part of the covering season had gone by. The produce results, too, were much better than in the South Punjab, probably because the North Punjab has been less affected by the scarcity. Five hundred and sixteen foals were dropped out of 1,676 mares covered during the previous year, giving an average of 30.78 per 100 mares covered and 17.79 per stallion employed. The corresponding figures in the previous year were 35.51 and 16 26. The results are slightly better than for Imperial stallions in the North Punjab, which show 28.06 foals per 100 mares covered and 13.55 per stallion employed. I do not think, however, that the data are as yet sufficient, or the diver- gence in results wide enough to establish any general deductions as to the working of the brand system. The statistics in both cases are not very reliable. In some cases, as in Pesháwar, no results were reported, in others mares were sold or sent away to other districts in search of fodder. The Superintendent reports that the services of the pony stallions are in great demand, and that it is to be regretted that the funds of District Boards are so low that more cannot be purchased, for the results, as now becoming apparent, are most satisfactory. They are especially useful in frontier districts where small mares of good stamp and quality are numerous. Dera Ismail Khan and Kohát have purchased one each during the year, and Hazára and Bannu are now the only districts in the circle where pony stallions are not maintained. The want will, it is understood, be soon supplied in Bannu, and arrangements will also be made to supply one for the new Lyallpur tahsíl in Jhang. More might be done in the same direction in Jhelum, Pesháwar and Dera Ismail Khan. Throughout the Pesháwar Division horse-breeding is still very backward. There are only 7 Imperial and 3 District stallions in the three districts, but the Superintendent is now endeavouring to push things, and, with the co-operation of the Deputy Commissioners and District Boards, steady improvement may be expected. Cost of feed and keep (Table E). 4. The average cost of feed and keep for each class of stallion was as follows:4 Mares branded or un- branded for District horse- breeding (Table F). 5. The total number of mares suitable for horse and pony breeding at the close of the year is returned as5 III.6 IV.7 There has been a decrease in in-patients in each case owing to the increased cost of keep which made owners unwilling to leave their animals in the hospitals which are attached to all the dispensaries except Rohtak, but the decrease is more than made up for by the increase in out-patients in all dispensaries except Hoshiárpur, where the decrease is trifling, and Rohtak, where it was considerable owing to large number of cattle having been taken away to other districts in search of fodder. I do not think animals suffering from infectious diseases, such as rinderpest or anthrax, should be admitted to these hospitals unless there are very complete arrangements for segregation, as there is a risk of their infecting other cattle, and thus deterring people from bringing in their animals for treatment. In Amritsar the cost was defrayed by the Municipal Committee, in Jalálabad by the Mamdot estate, in all other cases by the District Boards, Veterinary-Captain Joslen who inspected all the dispensaries in his circle during the year remarks : 8 discontinued. In this district alone castrations have fallen from 317 to 119. The Superintendent, South Punjab, draws attention to the fact that a fee is given in some districts and not in others, and suggests that it should be given in all or none, as the present practice makes those who do not receive it discon- tented. The attention of the Boards will be directed to this and also to the fact that several Veterinary Assistants did no castrations at all. In the South Punjab Circle 5.54 colts were castrated by salutries paid from Imperial Funds. VI.9 PROVINCIAL TABLE A.

Proceedings of the Hon'ble the Lieutenant.Governor of the Punjab, in the Revenue and Agricultural (General) Department, No. 716 S., dated 30th July 1898. READ2 with what is being done. No doubt it is most desirable in the interests of Govern- ment that mule breeding should be encouraged, but any real stimulus in this direction can only come from a general recognition by the people of the fact, if it is a fact, that mule-breeding is profitable. When this is demonstrated District Boards will no doubt not be behindhand in meeting the popular demand. 6. As in previous years, the Subordinate Veterinary Staff has been left very much to itself. The 64 Veterinary Assistants employed throughout the Province, however, are said to have treated 38,652 cases, out of which only 13 per cent. were fatal; but these figures cannot be looked upon as reliable, and there is no guarantee that the work was well done. A scheme proposed by the Punjab Government for the reorganization of the Subordinate Veterinary Agency has recently been submitted to the Government of India, and it is hoped that it will be possible to introduce some such reorganization coupled with arrangements for supervising the staff by an officer who would not be burdened with duties in connection with horse-breeding. With proper supervision the subordinate staff would become a most useful agency for the prevention of cattle disease, and promoting cattle-breeding generally 7. There has been an increase all round in the cost of keep of stallions of all classes during the past year. The average cost per head of each class varies considerably in the two Circles. The difference is too great to be accounted for by variations of prices, and points rather to diverse systems of management. There is no doubt room for economy in this respect, and the introduction of systematized management throughout the Province seems desirable. There are, it is understood, uniform rules as to the diet and management of Imperial stallions, and these might be adopted for the use of District Boards. 8. The number of castrations has fallen off considerably during the year under report. The decrease is no doubt in great part due to the cause assigned by the Director of Land Records. This branch of the Veterinary Assistant's work requires supervision if the results are to be of any value. 9. His Honor is pleased to observe that the dispensaries have been doing good work during the past year. 10. The cost of the Civil Veterinary Department to Provincial revenues was Rs. 18,793, or Rs. 70 less than in the preceding year. This does not include charges in connection with the Lahore Veterinary College. The Lieutenant- Governor will be glad if the Director will notice in future reports the expenditure on Veterinary objects of all descriptions, and on horse-breeding, of District Boards, noticing especially those Bodies which are exceptionally liberal or exceptionally remiss in this respect. One of the most difficult questions which from time to time arises in connection with the apportionment of local expenditure has reference to the contending claims of different departmentsNo. 1196, dated 9th July 1898. From2 The number of mares returned as not having held is 959, or just over 50 per cent. of the total covered. The Superintendent reports that the pony stallions are in greater demand than ever, and that the District Boards of Pesháwar, Gujrát, Sháhpur, Siálkot, Jhang and Ráwalpindi are making efforts to secure good pony sires. He states that their number might be increased with advantage as there are plenty of pony mares. Hazára and Bannu are the only districts without any pony stallions, and the expectation expressed in last year's report that the deficiency would be removed has not been fulfilled. In the Pesháwar Division, however, some improvement has taken place. South Punjab. 4. The proportion of stallions to districts in the South Punjab is much higher. At the beginning of the year 44 horse and 28 pony stallions were divided between the 18 districts of the South Punjab Circle. Of these, 10 horses and 9 ponies belonged to the Court of Wards or private persons. One horse was received on transfer from the head "Pony stallions " and two were purchased by the Multán and Gurgáon Boards, while 6 ponies were purchased by the Dera Gházi Khán, Jullundur, Montgomery and Umballa districts and 4 ponies were added by transfer from the head of " Horse stallions " Against these additions have to be set the death of 3 horses and 1 pony, the sale of 2 horses, the transfer of 4 horses to the head " Pony stallions," the transfer of one pony to the head " Horse stallions " and the disposal of 9 horses and 9 ponies as unfit for stud work. All the unfit stallions, whether horses or ponies, belonged to private persons. The close of the year thus saw 29 horses and 27 ponies at work, or an average of 3 horse and 3 pony stallions for every two districts. Roughly speaking, it may be said that the average number of stallions per district of the South Punjab is 3 against 2 in the North Punjab. The distribution in the former Circle at the close of the year was as follows:3 Of the sires borne on the registers on the 31st March 1898 27 horses and 26 ponies were employed at stud work. They covered 2,886 mares against 2,796 last year. The average number of mares covered was 61.51 per horse and 47.11 per pony stallion. The figures last year were, respectively, 60.75 and 50.11. The decrease in the pony coverings is doubtless due to the frontier troubles. The number of foals dropped by the 2,796 mares covered in the previous year by district stallions was returned as 663, which gives an average of 23.71 per hundred mares covered and 13 53 per stallion employed. As they stand, these figures are not satisfactory and show a slight decline even on the low percentages of last year, but the results of the coverings of no less than 1,147 mares are given as " not known." These must include a large number of suc- cessful coverings. General results. 5. The figures discussed above apply only to the working of District Board stallions, which has been shown separately this year in accordance with the instructions of the Lieutenant- Governor contained in the proceedings of the Revenue and Agricultural Depart- ment, No. 989 S, dated 11th August 1897. The general results of breeding opera- tions all over the Province are shown in the following table, which includes the statistics for the operations both of District Boards and private studs : 4 Some increase was naturally to be looked for owing to the very high prices of grain and the scarcity of fodder. The above statistics have been taken from tables E. and K., the figures of which do not appear to be reliable. For instance, the average keep of a horse has increased since 1894-95, which may be assumed to have been a year of normal prices, by 33.5 per cent., or a little over one-third. The average keep of a pony, however, has gone up by no less than 60.3 per cent., or nearly two-thirds, and the keep of a donkey by 46 per cent., or nearly one-half. The differences also between the average cost in the two circles are not easily explained. In the North Punjab the figures showing the average cost of maintaining a horse and pony have risen since last year by 1.7 and 5.5 per cent., respectively, while the keep of a donkey has fallen by 7.3 per cent. The similar variations in the South Punjab are 3.5, 3.5 and 3.4 per cent. Veterinary-Captain Joslen casts doubt on the figures from Ferozepore, Kángra, Rohtak and Dera Gházi Khán, but states there was no time to refer to these districts for further report. The financial question is a most important one and certainly requires elucidation. During the year District Boards are returned as having spent Rs. 27,721 on the feed and keep of stallions of all kinds as against Rs. 27,009 last year, an increase of 2.6 per cent. Mares branded or un- branded for district breed- ing. 7. The total number of mares suitable for horse and pony breeding at the close of the year is returned as:5 paigns. As was remarked in last year's Report District Boards would be well advised to leave mule-breeding alone at all events for some years to come. The Superintendent of the South Punjab however thinks that good might be done by distributing good sires to lambardárs and influential agriculturists. I am inclined to think that there are very few headmen who, either on their own behalf or as acting for the village community, would care to undertake the expense and responsibility of keeping up an animal which has not the sacredness attaching to the bull. In 1896 the Inspector-General Civil Veterinary Department raised the question of the advisability of branding selected mares for breeding ordnance mules. All district officers were asked to give an opinion on the proposal and with the exception of three who had no opinion to offer all expressed themselves as opposed to it. Since then no further action appears to have been taken in the matter. IV.6 V.7 The cost of the Amritsar dispensary was borne by the Municipal Com- mittee, of that at Jalálábád by the Mamdot estate and of the others by the District Boards. There can be no question that these institutions when properly supervised do excellent work and in the South Punjab they are generally well looked after. The Superintendent of the North Punjab reports that those in his charge appear to be doing good work. He has given no statistics of patients treated or of the cost. The number of patients has increased in every districts for which returns have been submitted in spite of the apppreciable reduction in the number of animals in the country caused by the late operations on the frontier. It is primâ facie evident therefore that the dispensaries are growing in popularity. The Deputy Commissioner of Umballa recommended that the hospital at that place be closed and the money devoted to other purposes. I did not agree with him but have postponed a final decision until I can inspect the place. The comparatively poor attendance Captain Parsons complained of appears to be due more to frequent changes in the staff than to a want of appre- ciation on the part of the owners of animals. Working of the subordi- nate establishment. 12. In last year's report the attention of District Officers was called to the lack of supervision over the Veterinary Assistants. The same complaint is made this year but the only officials who can efficiently supervise the working of these men are the Superintendents and the state of things described by Veterinary-Captain Joslen is only another strong argument for a recasting of the duties assigned to the gazetted officers of the Civil Veterinary Department. A Veterinary Officer is the proper person to control veterinary work, and if he finds a subordinate in any district inefficient or worse he can report him to the District Board for punishment. If a Superintendent does not make regular inspections8 VIII.9 PROVINCIAL TABLE A.

PROVINCIAL REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, PUNJAB, FOR THE YEAR 1898Proceedings of the Hon'ble the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab, in the Revenue and Agricultural (General) Department, No. 649 S., dated Simla, 1st August 1899. READ 2 7. The cost of the Civil Veterinary Department to Provincial Funds during the year under report was Rs. 17,989 as against Rs. 18,794 last year. The question of the expenditure from local sources on veterinary objects, and the degree in which the various Distict Boards interpret their obligations in this respect, has not, as desired in paragraph 10 of last year's review, been dealt with in the present report. The matter will doubtless need to be considered in connection with the contributions towards the cost of the reorganized subordi- nate veterinary agency, which District Boards will be invited to make under the scheme alluded to above. 8. On the whole the year has been a successful one, and the Lieutenant- Governor agrees with the Director of Land Records that thanks are due to Veterinary-Lieutenants Trydell and Smith and Veterinary-Captain Gunn for the supervision which they were able to extend to this branch of the veterinary work under their control. Their duties, however, are mainly connected with the subjects dealt with in the Imperial Report. ORDER.No: 1498, dated 6th July 1899. From2 The number of horse stallions was the same as last year; pony stallions show an increase of 6. This development is in the right direction. I have always held that District Board stallions ought to be ponies of 13.3 or 14 hands, not anything bigger. An Arab stallion of this height will get produce that will sell better than anything; and seeing that District Board money is con- tributed by the zamíndárs we ought to consider what will be most profitable to them The ponies bred from such stallions would fetch a good price for polo, or ordinary riding or driving, or for baggage; and in a generation or two the mares would be high enough to put to Government horse stallions. The Superintendent, South Punjab, suggests that, as transfers from the heading of horses to ponies and vice versa causes complications in the returns, all stallions the property of District Boards should in future be classed under one head. I think as long as both horse and pony stallions are kept they should be shown separately. I should say that the District Boards of Kohát, Dera Ismail Khan, Delhi, Karnál, Hoshiárpur, Mooltan, Gurdáspur and Kángra would do well to by degrees replace their horse stallions by ponies. Regarding Kángra Veterinary- Lieutenant Smith writes :3 The reduction in the present year is due to cheaper prices of grain and fodder. The rates in the South Punjab are naturally higher owing to the failure of crops in some of the southern districts. II. 4 " Treatment has been carried on by District Salútris. To be able to do any good in this direction I would beg to be allowed to call attention to my remarks under this head in last year's report. The instituting of Veterinary dispensaries is about the only method to get the people to understand the advantages to be gained by adopting our remedies in treating animals, and until every tahsil has at least one Veterinary dispensary we shall be handicapped and make little or no progress in teaching the people the best way to treat their sick animals." South Punjab.5 If due justice is to be done to the people whose live-stock consists so largely of cattle, it will be necessary ere long to have a fourth Superintendent. I have no doubt that the best way to help the people will be to have central dispensaries in charge of competent Assistants in all districts, and for a cer- tain number of extra Veterinary Assistants to be available to deal with disease in the villages.

Proceedings of the Hon ble the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab, in the Revenue and Agricultural (General) Department, No. 703 S., dated 28th July 1900. READ2 5. Owing to the fodder famine there was very great mortality among cattle during the year, and fairs were frequented chiefly for the purpose of the sale at low prices of cattle which their owners could not afford to keep. Veterinary-Captain Gunn's valuable and interesting report on the cattle of Jhelum, Ráwalpindi and Hazára was consequently received by Government at a time which was not favourable for taking action upon it. 6. It is observed that no new Veterinary Dispensaries were established during the year, and that the question of starting one at Delhi was held in abeyance owing to the famine. The total number in the whole Province is at present 10, and the remarks made by the Superintendents on the working of the Siálkot and Amritsar Dispensaries show how useful these institutions are when carefully worked. In this direction also His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor hopes that the reorganization of the Subordinate Veterinary service will result in considerable improvements. The scheme suggested by Colonel Montgomery for having a central dispensary in charge of a competent Assistant in each district would no doubt result not only in the more successful treatment of disease, but also in the dissemination among the agricultural classes of the knowledge of the methods by which disease can be successfully treated. 7. That there was no decrease this year in the number of castrations of colts was satisfactory, considering that the year was one of famine, a circumstance which probably accounts for a material reduction in the number of castrations effected in the Delhi Division. 8. Consequent on the removal of the Depôt to Abbott-abad His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor has recently sanctioned an arrangement by which the head-quarters of the Superintendent, North Punjab, will be located at Abbott-abad. The head-quarters of the Superintendent, South Punjab, will also be at Abbott-abad from 1st July to 1st October to admit of the Superintendent, North Punjab, going on tour, as it is necessary that one of the Superintendents should be present at the Depôt during that period. The Superintendent, South Punjab, will spend the months of May and June in Simla. It is of great importance that any outbreak of disease on the tonga line should be promptly dealt with In this connection it is satisfactory to observe that the Superintendent, North Punjab, succeeded in checking an outbreak of glanders on the cart-road to Srínagar in the summer of 1899. 9. The cost of the Civil Veterinary Department to Provincial Funds during the year under report was Rs 21,045-80 as against Rs. 17,989 in the previous year. The increase was almost entirely under the head of travelling allowance, and the amount drawn under this head was considerable. In accordance with the remarks made in paragraph 7 of last year's Review it is observed that a new Table R has been attached to the Report showing for 1898-99 the expenditure incurred by District Boards on Veterinary objects and countervailing receipts from horse and cattle fairs. It is hoped that next year it will be possible to give the figures under these heads for the actual year under report. 10. His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor concurs in the commendation which the Director bestows on the work done during the year by Veterinary- Lieutenants Trydell and Smith, and wishes to express his thanks to Mr. Sykes for an interesting Report. ORDER.No. 1385, dated 13th July 1900. From2 was reduced by 4 in the districts of the Dehli Division where one horse died from natural causes, another was destroyed and two other were sold. Districts, which have a considerable number of pony stallions, are Dera Gházi Khan, which owns 8, Ráwalpindi with 7, and Hissár, Ludhiána, Lahore, Amritsar and Shahpur with 4 each. The District Boards of Hazára, Ráwalpindi, Siálkot, Delhi and Hissár each purchased a new pony stallion for stud purposes, and one was presented to the District Board of Jhelum. One of the ponies was destroyed and one died from natural causes. There was therefore a net increase of four ponies, bringing the total up to 69. Twenty-nine of the 31 horse stallions, and 66 out of 69 pony stallions, owned by District Boards, are Arabs. In this respect District Boards have no doubt wisely followed the advice of officers of the Civil Veterinary Department. The Inspector-General noticed in the general report of the Department for 1898-99 that the solid foundation of all horse breeding in this country is the Arab sire, and Veterinary-Lieutenant Trydell, the Superintendent, North Punjab, remarks as follows :3 Taking into account only the figures of ascertained results the per- centage of successful coverings in the North Punjab Circle was 33.6 and in the Southern Circle 40.2. The coverings by pony stallions were somewhat more successful than those by horse stallions. With reference to the remarks in paragraph 3 of the Review of the Hon'ble the Lieutenant-Governor on the Provincial Report of last year, the attention of Deputy Commissioners has again been drawn to the Manual on Horse-breeding by Veterinary-Captain Pease and to a Primer regarding the Management and Treatment of Brood Mares published by the "Official Press" at Meerut. The percentage of coverings, the result of which is not known, is large. This is unavoidable, owing to the fact that many mares are sold or have been taken to other districts before the result has been ascertained. Cost of feed and keep. 5. The following statement shows the cost of the feed and keep of the different kind of stallions as shown in the returns of the last five years :4 In order to suppress this disease, an organised Veterinary staff is very badly needed, as in some districts, Simla for instance, where the disease is very prevalent, no Veterinary Assistants are employed. During the year the services of an Imperial Veteri- nary Assistant have been lent to the Simla District. Preventive inoculations against this disease (the success of which has now been well established) on an extensive scale is likely to result in checking the ravages of this disease to a very great extent. With reference to these remarks it may be noted that the scheme for the organisation of the subordinate Veterinary Staff employed by District Boards has been submitted to the Government of India. As regards inocu- lations, Veterinary-Major Haggar, the Assistant to the Inspector-General, Civil Veterinary Department, with the consent of the Punjab Government, instead of continuing the cattle survey, which, owing to the famine, had to be postponed, carried on experiments in inoculations for rinderpest. He has recently in- formed me that this method of treatment has passed the experimental stage, and Deputy Commissioners have been asked to report direct to him the occurrence of an outbreak of rinderpest so that measures may be taken at once to prevent it spreading. Anthrax has been prevalent in Amritsar, Hoshiárpur, Gurdáspur, Lahore, Gujránwála and Hazára. Foot and mouth disease has been much less general than last year. The Superintendent, South Punjab Circle, was able to give his attention to the suppression of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease on the Simla-Kálka road. Isolation and hospital posts were formed, each under a Veterinary Assistant, with most favourable results. He also attended the Amritsar (Dewáli and Baisákhi), Rewári and Sirsa cattle fairs and instituted a system of isolation and treatment of diseased cattle in temporary hospitals. In regard to the work done by the Veterinary Assistants employed by District Boards, Veterinary-Lieutenant Trydell of the North Punjab Circle reports as follows :5 Table showing the number of patients treated in the dispensaries and their cost.

Proceedings of the Hon'ble the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab, in the Revenue and Agricultural (General) Department, No. 637 S., dated the 29th July 1901. READ2 8. The aggregate number of stallions owned by District Boards (99) is the same as that shown last year, but only 3 are shown as "horses" as against 30 last year. This difference is accounted for by the change of classification alluded to in the Report, whereby the status and nomenclature of all but three of the stallions formerly classed as horses were altered. The popularity of the pony stallion among the agricultural classes continues to be maintained. The large decrease in the general average of mares covered per stallion in the North Punjab, which was remarked last year, has been succeeded by a slight increase, while in the South Punjab the number was about the same as in the previous year. 9. The proposal referred to by the Director that 50 donkey stallions should be purchased from Imperial Revenues for maintenance by District Boards has been sanctioned by the Government of India, who, however, have not yet intimated the market in which they wish the animals to be purchased. 10. Of the 13,511 cases of rinderpest reported during the year, 8,121, or 60 per cent., proved fatal, as against 11,723 deaths last year from that disease. But the figures available are, no doubt, defective, as is noted in the Report. The results of inoculation and the attitude of the people are said to have been encour- aging. The Lieutenant-Governor hopes that the scheme for training District Board Veterinary Assistants to perform inoculations for rinderpest at the Muktesar Bacteriological Laboratory will bear fruit. Anthrax claimed a considerable number of victims, while foot-and-mouth disease was again prevalent, especially in Kángra. 11. The grant of Rs. 2,000 sanctioned by the Local Government for the purchase of Hissar bulls for different districts was made full use of, 16 bulls being supplied as against o in the preceding year. 12. The Veterinary Dispensaries, which, as in the previous year, were 10 in number, supplemented by three branch institutions at outlying tahsíls of the Siálkot District, are well reported on, and it is hoped that their number will be increased when the reorganization of Veterinary Assistants is accomplished. 13. The number of castrations by Veterinary Assistants shows a decrease of 98, as compared with the previous year in which the fodder scarcity had not produced its full effect in reducing the condition of the young stock to such an extent as to necessitate a postponement of the operation in many cases. 14. The provincial cost of the Civil Veterinary Department was Rs. 16,009 as against Rs. 21,045 last year, the saving being chiefly under the head of travelling allowance. 15. His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor agrees with the Director of Land Records and Agriculture that Veterinary-Lieutenants Trydell and Smith deserve credit for the way in which they performed their duties during the year, and wishes to express his thanks to Mr. Sykes for an interesting Report.

I.PART I. PUNJAB VETERINARY COLLEGE, LAHORE. I have the honor to submit the following Annual Report on the working of the Punjab Veterinary College for the year 1900-1901. Curriculum of instruc- tion. At a Conference held in Umballa on the 29th January 1900 and following days, to consider the most suitable curriculum which would tend to uniformity of teaching at the various Veterinary Educational Establishments, it was decided that a three years' course should be adopted, the subjects being as follows: 2 Senior class- The Senior or Final year class under the old rules3 Report by Examiners. The report of the Board of Examiners is given as Appendix I; from this it will be seen that the results are considered satisfactory. In regard to the remark concerning Pharmacy, it will be noted that an improvement has been effected during the year, but the Final class was still considered somewhat weak. I can confidently state that men were much better than those last year. Special attention had been devoted to the subject, and everything possible done to ensure a thorough knowledge of it. Professor Dawson devoted a considerable amount of time to the class, and it is satisfactory to find that no complaint was necessary in regard to the first year's class in the same subject. Entrance examination. The Entrance Examination was held on the 15th of April 1901. The competition for entrance was very great, and the class of men presenting themselves much improved. There were 134 candidates for admission against 88 last year. Thirteen Entrance-passed men presented themselves against two last year, and all were admitted. Eight paying men were admitted. Seeing that under the new rules we may expect, as a rule, in favourable years, a high percentage of rejections, probably not less than 25 per cent., I have this year admitted 65 men to the first year's class. A great number of very suitable men had to be sent away as we could not accommodate more. The students now at the College comprise the following:4 Appendix VIII.5 PART II. CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT PROVINCIAL REPORT. I.6 Arab sires. The object in view is not to produce remounts, but a class of animal suited to the people and not too expensive to feed. It is also under- stood that the cross is frequently larger than the sire, and forms a good basis for future breeding for a higher class of animal. From almost all districts reports are received of the increasing popularity of the District Board stallions. The Superintendent, South Punjab, reports that this class of stallion is undoubtedly doing an immense amount of good in improving the class for which it is intended, and notwithstanding the very great scarcity of fodder during the first part of the year under report, the Superintendents of both North and South Punjab Circles, report favourably on the success of the breeding operations of the year. In the North Punjab, the average number of coverings per stallion was slightly in excess of the average of the previous year, and in the South Punjab, the number was about the same. II.7 dispensaries; and advise in regard to the measures to be taken; but the above account will show how great is the need for a third Superintendent, who could give his whole time to the treatment of cattle disease. IV.8 The dispensaries at Daska, Pasrúr and Raya are branches of the Central Dispensary at Siálkot. The Superintendent, South Punjab, has inspected all the dispensaries in his circle, and reports that these institutions continue to increase in popular favour and are undoubtedly doing a great deal of good and useful work. Judging from the great success which has attended the Sialkot Dispensaries, the Superintendent of the North Punjab regrets that more has not been done in this direction in other districts of his circle. When the organization of Veterinary Assistants is accomplished, it is the intention of the Superintendent to submit a scheme to start several other small dispensaries where needed. Work done by Veteri- nary Assistants. The greater part of the work done by Veterinary Assistants is done on tour from village to village. The total number of cases treated was 57,020 against 56,998 last year. The services of these men are said to be much appreciated by the zamíndárs. The details of the scheme to make the service a provincial one are practically completed. The number of castrations by Veterinary Assistants was 680 compared with 778 last year. The decrease is to be attributed to the fact that many young animals were in poor condition owing to the fodder scarcity, and in such cases the operation was postponed. VI.APPENDIX I.

Proceedings of the Hon'ble the Lieuteuant Governor of the Punjab in the Revenue and Agricultural (General) Department, No. 1060 S., dated Simla, 28th July 1903. READ2 officers prevented this scheme from being get into full working order during the year and threw extra work on Veterinary-Lieutenant Smith, Superintendent of the South Punjab Circle, but arrangements are now on a satisfactory footing. The Superintendent of the North Punjab Circle still retains charges as Civil Veterinary Officer of the districts in the new Frontier Province, but the statistics attached to this report relate only to the Punjab as now constituted. 7. The Lieutenant-Governor is glad to see that the results of District pony and mule breeding are considered to have been attended with most favourable results. His Honour, however doubts if the proposal of Veterinary- Lieutenant Smith that pony stallions should be supplied to District Boards free of cost will commend itself to the Imperial Government. The attention of the District Board of Sialkot will no doubt be invited by the Deputy Commissioner to the remarks made by the Superintendent, North Punjab, regarding the ne- cessity for providing pony stallions in that district. 8. Sir Charles Rivaz has read with much interest the remarks of Veterinary-Lieutenant Walker given in Sections IIICONTENTS OF REPORT. PART I.ii PAGE. APPENDIX VII H.PART I. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE PUNJAB VETERINARY COLLEGE, LAHORE, FOR THE OFFICIAL YEAR 1901-02. I have the honor to submit the following Annual Report on the work- ing of the Punjab Veterinary College for the year 1901-02, which is a record of the continued success of the Institution. Curriculum of instruc- tions. During the year under report there were only two classes of the new three years' course studying, the final year of the old two years' course having been completed last year. Consequently no Veterinary Assistants received diplomas this year. Summer Session. The Summer Session commenced on the 16th April, the number of new students admitted was 65 against 39 in the previous year. Of these 24 were military men, 16 from districts, 9 paying, 15 free, and one specially nominated student, who did not join. I do not again intend to take specially nominated or paying students unless they have the same educational qualifications as free students, as I find they do not make good students being either idle or lacking in intelligence. Winter Session. The Winter Session began on the 1st October 1901. Second Year's Class. The Second Year Class numbered 29 (including 2 military men who, on return from Field Service in China, were allowed to join this class after the first year's examination last year) all of whom completed the year and presented themselves for examination. First Year's Class. The Junior or first Year's Class numbered 65, but this was reduced to 54, one District student absenting himself from the examina- tion; one paying and 9 free students leaving shortly after entering the College. Board of Examiners. The Examining Board composed as under, assembled on the 3rd April 1902. 1. Veterinary Lieutenant A. Smith, Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, South Punjab. 2. Veterinary-Lieutenant F. S. H. Baldrey, Assistant to Inspector- General, Civil Veterinary Department. 3. Veterinary Lieutenant G. K. Walker, Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Provincial Circle, Punjab. Results of examinations. At this examination 29 students presented themselves for the Second year's examination, and of these 24 passed and 5 failed, of whom one military student having done very badly in the examination was sent back to his regiment as unfit, and 4 men allowed to remain another year in the same class. The percentage of passes is 83 which is satisfactory. The First Year's students were also examined by the Board of Examiners, and out of 54 candidates 44 passed, 10 failing to satisfy the examiners. Of these 2 military, 2 paying and 2 free students, having done very badly in all subjects, were dismissed from the College; and 4 allowed to continue the same course for another year. I am glad to be able to report that there was marked improvement in this class over last year, due to improved system in teaching and text-books having been made available. Report of the Board of Examiners. The report of the Board of Examiners is given as Appendix I, from which it will be seen that the results are distinctly satis- factory. The percentage of marks obtained shows that 8 men obtained over 500 marks out of 600, in A Class, against nil last year;
2 the first man getting 545 and 30 men obtained over 400 marks against 13 last year. Four men obtained over 400 out of 500 marks in B Class, and 12 over 350. It is satisfactory to note that our students have showed an improvement on last year in Materia Medica and Pharmacy, and also in the handling of animals. In fact there has been an all-round improvement in every subject. Special attention has been given to the above subjects and every effort made to ensure a thorough knowledge of them, so year by year we seem to be improv- ing in our means and methods of teaching and obtaining more satisfactory results, and this notwithstanding the fact that our subjects have been enormously increased and we have dealt with 10 of these subjects during the year against five last year with no extra staff, and in fact, for a great part of the busiest time of the year, without the assistance of the European Professor. It will, of course, be impossible for us to now teach the five extra subjects, especially without the services of a qualified and hard-working Professor, who has a good knowledge of the language, permanently appointed to the College. A know- ledge of the language is necessary as otherwise one of the native teaching staff has to be constantly employed in interpreting and this causes much loss of time and is unsatisfactory. I find it impossible to carry on the work properly without the assistance of the Professor. Entrance Examination. The Entrance Examination was held on the 15th April 1902. The competition for entrance was ordinary, there being 125 candidates for admission against 134 last year. This year only one Entrance passed man presented himself against 13 last year, and he was admitted. Three paying men were admitted. The students now at the College comprise the following:3 The practice derived from the treatment of the diseases from which equine "In" and "Out-door" patients were suffering is a varied one and affords fair facilities for teaching. Contagious diseases were brought in fair numbers. The students had an opportunity of seeing cases of Surra in camels, dogs, cattle and the horse, Cattle plague, Foot and mouth disease, Glanders, Tetanus and Rabies. Income and expenditure. Appendix IV shows receipts and the amount outstanding at close of the year. The amount paid into the Treasury was Rs. 3,852-15-0, against Rs. 4,483-8-0 last year, or a decrease of Rs. 630-9-0. There has been an all round slight decrease in the receipts from all sources. The chief loss has been in fees from paying students from other provinces which accounts for Rs. 405, out of Rs. 630-9-0 decrease. This class of students is discouraged as before mentioned. The Rs. 114 decrease in practice fees was due partly to the fact that we were short-handed and that the Principal was unable single-handed to devote sufficient attention to the matter in ad- dition to his other duties. The Professor is in charge of this department and was removed at the beginning of the busy season. It was possibly also partially due to the fact that for the first time, for many years, an Army Veterinary Department man has been actively engaged in private practice, in Meeán Meer, so that taking this into consideration and also the fact, that for part of the year regiments, who sent ponies to the College, have been absent from the station, the amount realized in fees is satisfactory. The comparison of departmental and treasury receipts on account of income from Veterinary College, Punjab, has been carried out in my office, and that the two sets of figures have been found to agree. The total amount of outstandings on the 31st of March 1902 was Rs. 230-4-0 against Rs. 213 on the corresponding date last year. This is owed by various persons and is now being realized. The amount booked is Rs. 3,882-3-0 against Rs. 4,547-2-0 last year or a decrease of Rs. 664-15-0. Appendix V is a statement of the establishment and contingent expen- diture showing a slight increase of Rs. 395 in the Imperial Revenue owing to the Professor having been on half pay for a part of last year. There was also an increase of Rs. 1,088 in the Provincial Revenue owing to the increments given to the native teaching staff. In regard to the item "Hospital requisites" it is to be explained that owing to the introduction of the three year's course, some special devices were introduced for more practical training which accounts for the increased expenditure under this head. The same explanation may be accepted as to the item "Country medicines" as more samples for the teaching of Botany and Materia Medica to the two classes, under the new rules, had to be purchased. The item "Forge Maintenance" also exhibits a slight increase which is due to the fact that for training the Nálband Class more charcoal and iron, with some rise in the rates, was necessary. General. The demand for Veterinary Assistants still remains very great, applica- tions from all sources being numerous. The men sent to Africa have generally been very well reported on. I am sorry to record that two of them are reported to have been killed in the action at Klipdrift. One Veterinary Assistant also died in Uganda. Volunteers for service in foreign countries are plentiful always when the services of men are available. Men in private practice are doing well and I think that more of them will start soon, as they are encouraged by the success of those who have already done so. I am sorry to find that the terms offered in the Punjab Pro- vincial Service are so bad, worse even than those in the Transport and in the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh Subordinate Veterinary Department, and I am afraid the Government cannot expect to secure the services of the best men which seems a pity considering that they spend money on training them. The market value must be paid for the services of good men otherwise they would not accept service, and if the best men be not encouraged to join the sub- ordinate department the results will not be good. The Vernacular Veterinary Journal has been kept up and is now issued monthly instead of quarterly. This was done as the result of constant appeals
4 from Veterinary Assistants, although it entails increase of work. In order to secure its advantages to all Veterinary Assistants in the Province, an offer has been made to the Government to supply one hundred copies to the various Veterinary subordinates at a cost of two hundred and fifty rupees or at a reduc- tion of Rs. 5 per copy. This of course represents a great loss of profit being less by Rs. 50 than the sum we already obtain from this source, but in the interest of Veterinary science in India it seems advisable. The following text-books have been published during the year to meet the requirements of the Conference:PART II. CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT PROVINCIAL REPORT. Re-organization of the Superior and Subordinate Civil Veterinary Depart- ment, Punjab. The two Circles, known as the North and South Punjab Circles, have not been altered in consequence of the separation of the North- West Frontier Province. The Superintendent of the North Punjab Circle still retains charge as Civil Veterinary Officer of the districts included in the Frontier Province under the direction, as far as that province is concerned, of the Revenue Commissioner. The statistics included in this report both as regards horse and mule breeding and cattle relate only to the Punjab as newly constituted. The Punjab has at length been fortunate in obtaining the services of a third Superintendent of the Civil Veterinary Department, able to give his whole time to the investigation and treatment of cattle disease. The new Circle which has been constituted, embraces the whole of the Punjab, and is officially styled the Provincial Circle. Superintendents of the other two Circles, North and South Punjab, are thus able to devote themselves exclusively as far as the Punjab is concerned, to the duties connected with horse and mule breeding. As it happened indeed, Veterinary Lieutenant Trydell, the Superintendent of the North Punjab, was absent on furlough throughout the year. Veterinary Lieutenant Smith, the Superintendent of the South Punjab, was in charge of both North and South Circles during the year, and Veterinary Lieutenant Walker, who has been placed in charge of the Provincial Circle, did not join the province until October. For the greater part of the year, therefore, Veterinary Lieutenant Smith had to work single-handed. The arrangements for the re-organisation of the Subordinate Veterinary Establishment were completed in time for Mr. Walker to take charge on his arrival, of the establishment of Veterinary Assistants who were formerly in the employment of District Boards, and who have now been organised as a Provincial Service. Sections III, IV and V of this report are abstracted from a very interesting report received from Mr. Walker. The sections dealing with horse and mule breeding are collated from the reports received from the Sup- erintendents of the North and South Punjab. I.6 " between the Arabi country-bred and an Arab. Besides several instances have" "occurred this year of the pony stallion produce being bought for native" "cavalry remounts. I consider it would be an improvement on the present" "system if pony stallions were supplied by the Imperial Government and their" "distribution left to me, the District Board only paying for their feed and keep." "I suggest this as at present in many districts where pony stallions are greatly" "needed, it is often the case that the District Board is not in a sufficiently" "flourishing condition financially to buy a pony." The Superintendent. Civil Veterinary Department, North Punjab, sug- gests that the District Board of Siálkot should purchase a couple of pony stal- lions as there are really very few mares in the district other than pony mares. The number of foals dropped as the result of the previous year's covering was 1,316, the number not held, 2,205 and the number not known 1,375, the average per stallion being 15.9, 26.6 and 16.6 respectively. II.7 "repeated attacks in the same animal are frequent. Veterinary Assistants" "are able to render very great assistance by treating affected animals. Rules" "for prevention of intercommunication between infected and healthy villages" "are required to be enforced." Rinderpest. "Rinderpest is, as a rule, the scourge of the province in so far as it "is the cause of great mortality amongst cattle, buffaloes "and occasionally sheep and goats. The past year has "been quite exceptional. Only 528 cases were reported during the year " under report against 13,511 last year, and the mortality was 43.3 per cent. "against 60.1 per cent. last year. I have visited outbreaks in Jhelum and "Ráwalpindi Districts, the only places where they have been at all severe so "far as I have received information since I joined this appointment. I was ''able in both these districts to personally initiate preventive inoculation. "Some slight opposition was experienced at first, but the people soon "recognised the merits of the method and finally asked for it in both places. "A statement is attached showing the results, and I venture to think they "are most satisfactory. One thousand two hundred and seventy-nine animals "were inoculated, of which only 2 died after inoculation and the disease was "stayed. The two animals that died in Jhelum District died of rinderpest "within 6 days of inoculation As the method used was that called the" "serum alone" method by which it is impossible to communicate the disease "these animals must have been suffering when inoculated though it was not Method used ''serum alone." " apparent. In this method all contact cattle are inoculated if not suffering at" "the time from the disease. Cattle that have recovered" "from the disease are not inoculated. The animals are not'' "incommoded, and there is no danger if done by experienced hands. No" "segregative measures re required, as inoculated animals can be mixed with" "diseased ones with impunity. The immunity conferred is of fleeting" "duration, but in my opinion if simultaneous measures are taken to destroy " "the virus of the disease in the cowsheds, &c., it is sufficient to tide over" "an outbreak. These concomitant measures are necessary to prevent danger" "of re-infection when the immunity has passed off. The method is specially" "applicable to India as the sun is a great factor in destroying the virus." The "simultaneous method.'' "I am of opinion that the time is not yet ripe for the general appli-" "cation of the "simultaneous method" in India, and" "that is why I have not used it. It requires constant" "and close personal supervision and that with my present staff I am not" "able to give. It is perhaps not necessary for me to go into details, but this" "method entails the use of the blood of a diseased animal which has gener-" "ally to be obtained on the spot. To be effectual the animal has to" "go through an attack of fever which throws him temporarily out of work" "and it is not without its dangers. The slightest error will cause mor-" "tality. From a scientific point of view the method is ideal as when suc-" "cessfully carried out it should protect for life. It is essentially a preventive" "inoculation, and if it could be practised on all the cattle of the province" "rinderpest might be stamped out, This method is from the zamíndár's point" "of view very much more objectionable than the other, and I doubt if he will" "accept it at present. In actual outbreaks he may accept inoculation and" "then the "serum alone method" suffices. A cordon of animals round an" "infected area inoculated by the "simultaneous method" would be an excellent" "thing, but here again the personal supervision of an officer is required and" "even then losses may occur." Preventive measures. "Preventive inoculation has now received a start in the Punjab; Ve-" "terinary Assistants are being trained at Muktesar, and" "when they are equipped, I believe, we can deal satisfac-" "torily with this disease. Help is required from District Officers to start the" "work as in some cases villagers are against it. Good results will soon" "overcome their prejudices. I propose, as soon as possible, writing a pamph-" "let on the subject for village schools and for distribu-" "tion generally to the agricultural population," Preparation of a pamph- let for village schools. "Veterinary Assistants Kotu Rám, Ahmad Bakhsh and Tálib Khan" "have done good work in preventive inoculation."
8 Charbon symptomatique (black-quarter ). "I have not been able to hear of any outbreaks of black-quarter since" "I joined this appointment though I have specially asked" "for early information as the Imperial Bacteriologist is" "anxious to obtain it. No doubt it occurs, but probably it is more common" "in the rainy season." Anthrax. "Anthrax is fairly commonly reported. Six hundred and twenty-eight" "cases occurred during the year with a mortality of 76.1" "per cent. Last year's figures show 1,816 with a mort-" "ality of 91.30." "I have visited outbreaks for the purpose of preventive inoculation" "and investigation. In the first outbreak near Lahore I was unable to make" "a diagnosis except from hearsay, there being no sick animals present. The" "people (Sikhs) objected to inoculation, but six animals were done belonging" "to the headman." Malignant sore throat. "In the second outbreak in Siálkot District I was able to see the' "disease. It was that called malignant sore throat" "(ghotwa galghotu), and it is usually classified as anthrax" "by Veterinary Assistants. Twenty animals had died including five donkeys." "The principal animals attacked are buffaloes, and from the first appearance" "of the symptoms in fatal cases death usually occurs in 24 hours. Very few" "animals recover as a rule. The clinical symptoms simulate closely a form" "of anthrax and the clinical history is also somewhat similar. The disease" "is an important one and requires early attention. I strongly recommend it" "to the notice of the Imperial Bacteriologist. I was my-" "self, though much pressed for time, able to do some-" Investigation. "thing towards investigating the disease. I had very little apparatus as it" "has not yet arrived from England, but the Principal, Punjab Veterinary Col-" "lege, kindly allowed me to do some work there. I was unable to complete'' "my work owing to the necessity of leaving head-quarters. I hope at a" "future date to be able to continue my investigations. So far as I have gone" "I am led to the conclusion that the disease is not anthrax and although" "the symptoms coincide with those described by Veterinary Captain Pease in" "his note on ghotwa, my inoculation experiments did not agree with those there-" "in described. It is possible of course the disease may be due to a vegetable" "poisoning." Pleuropneumonia, "No cases were reported during the year, I have not yet seen the" "specific contagious pleuropneumonia in this country" "which was at one time so prevalent in Great Britain," "but I believe it occurs. It is possibly not common in the Punjab. Last" "year 154 cases were shown, but they may not have been specific." Glanders. "Two cases of glanders were discovered by Veterinary Assistant'' "Sazawár on duty at Amritsar during the autumn cattle" "fair among hackney carriage ponies. The diagnosis" "was confirmed by me and the animals were destroyed in my presence. A" "full report was made by me at the time and the Military authorities inform-" "ed. I also made arrangements for inspection of horses leaving Amritsar" "Fair by rail." IV.9 Local breeding. "In the meantime the supply of bulls must be kept up and this will" "probably have to be done locally. I have not at pre-" "sent much knowledge of the state of local breeding" "but what information I have is not encouraging. Weedy miniature bulls are" "often used and castrated as soon as they are old enough to work. The" "best breeding stock of the districts is in many cases allowed to leave it, and" "the cows are too often regarded as mere milking machines." Grant of prizes for breed- ing stock at fairs. "A great factor for the encouragement of local breeding is the giving" "of substantial prizes for breeding stock, and these" "prizes should be given every year. The zamíndár, as a" "rule, takes good care of his bullocks, but I cannot say the same for his breed-" "ing stock. The zamíndars of Chakwál and Talagang Tahsíls of Jhelum Dis-" "trict are a distinct exception to this in so far as their bulls are concerned." "When prizes are given by local bodies I recommend in future that the" "most valuable prizes be set apart for breeding stock, i.e., bulls, cows, and" "heifers. I anticipate good results from the five shows which are now estab-" "lished for which prize money has been given by the Imperial Government." V.10 Training of inefficient Veterinary Assistants at the Punjab Veterinary College. (Post-graduate course). "Having obtained your permission I propose, when the College staff " "regains its normal strength, to send as many men as" "possible whom I have discovered are backward in pro-" "fessional knowledge to the College in batches for" "periods of three months. They will be able to attend" "lectures and demonstrations, and I shall, as far as possible, give some atten-" "tion to them myself when in Lahore. I think this post-graduate course" "should be of great benefit to many of the men as owing to lack of profes-" "sional supervision they have forgotten a good deal of their professional work." Equipment and carriage of medicines. "A statement is attached showing the number of animals treated and" "castrations performed during the year, Animals treated at dispensaries" "have not been included in these figures. There is much useful work in" "front of these District Veterinary Assistants in connection with disease" "and breeding among domestic animals. At present they tour regularly in" "their circles and give advice which is not always taken. Some have" "medicines which they are able to use with advantage, but many are very" "imperfectly equipped both with medicines and instru-" "ments. I am of opinion that contributions from Local" "Bodies on a fixed scale are required for the purpose of equipment, and" "some arrangement is necessary to enable the men to carry their medicines," "&c., with them when on tour. Sufficient I think can be taken in saddle" "bags on a riding pony, provided a room for dispensing at head-quarters" "is given. Each should spend about 20 days on tour in his circle and ten" "days at his head-quarters where he can do any serious operations requir-" "ing consecutive attendance and attend to animals brought in. He would" "of course be always available for urgent duty anywhere in his circle." "These men are now being equipped by me with necessary registers" "and forms to enable me to check their work, and they will all work in" "future on similar lines. In addition to supplying me with information" "concerning disease, they will now be required to send me certain in forma-" "tion in connection with cattle breeding," VII.11 which shall be in charge of a Veterinary Assistant on somewhat higher pay than the present rates; (2) an increase in the number of Veterinary Assistants, so as to provide one itinerating Veterinary Assistant for each tahsil in the province as well as one for each Veterinary Hospital at the head-quarters of the district. Each tahsil should also have its Veterinary Dispensary in subordination to the Veterinary Hospital at the head-quarters of the district; (3) the appointment of a higher grade of Veterinary Inspector on much higher pay; one such In- spector is required for each division, and one as Assistant to the Superintend- ent. The appointment of the senior grade of Veterinary Inspectors seems to be a matter that is urgently required, as at present the Superintendent single- handed has to supervise the work of over 70 men spread over the Punjab.
APPENDIX I. Report of the Board of Examiners appointed to conduct the annual examination of students at the Punjab Veterinary College for 1902. The Board composed of the undermentioned Veterinary Officers, assembled at the College on 31st March 1902 and the five following days. PRESIDET: Vety. Lieut. A. SMITH, Supdt., G. V. D., South Punjab. MEMBERS: Vety. Lieut. F. S. H. BALDREY, Assistant to Inspector-General, C. V. D. Vety. Lieut. G. K. WALKER, Supdt., C. V. D., Provincial Circle, Punjab. Owing to the enforcement of the rules laid down by the Umballa Conference there were this year only two classes, the Third Year Class "C" not yet having completed the three years' course. In Class "A" 54 students were examined and 44 passed. In Class "B" 29 students examined and 24 passed. The percentage of passes is distinctly satisfactory. The standard for Physiology is elementary, but the general knowledge is distinctly higher and creditable, considering they have not yet received full instruction in Anatomy. The Examiners think that a practical course in fodder and poisonous plants would be more desirable than the Elementary Theoretical Botany which is at present in vogue. This subject might be combined with hygiene and dietetics. In the handling of animals and Materia Medica and Pharmacy the students showed an improvement on last year. (Sd.) A. SMITH, VETY.

Veterinary-Lieutenant Walker has again submitted interesting remarks on the subject of cattle disease which are commended to the attention of all District Officers and Local Bodies. The Lieutenant-Governor observes with satisfaction the growing popularity of inoculation as a preventive of rinderpest and anthrax, and His Honour approves of the action of the Director of Land Records in issuing a reminder to Deputy Commissioners asking them to impress on lambardars the serious consequences of delay in reporting outbreaks of the disease where it is one for which serum is available, and the necessity for seeing that patwaris transmit prompt reports of outbreaks of disease. 7. The Lieutenant-Governor agrees with the remarks made by the Director in Section IV of the Report on the subject of the supply of bulls, and will await the reference which it is understood the Inspector-General, Civil Veterinary Department, will make on the subject, but if it is proposed to establish a bull-run on the Jhelum Colony an early reference should be made to the Financial Commissioner on the subject, so that the necessary land may be secured. 8. The touring scheme for Veterinary Assistants proposed by the Super- intendent, Provincial Circle, is an excellent one. The work of the Subordinate Veterinary Staff appears to have been well supervised during the year, and pro- posals for its reorganisation should be submitted as soon as convenient. 9. The Lieutenant-Governor agrees with the Director of Land Records that the thanks of Government are due to Veterinary-Captain Walker for the energy and tact which he has shown in the performance of his duties, and also to Veterinary-Major Pease and Mr. Oliver and Veterinary-Captain Trydell for the good work done by them during the year. ORDERPART I. THE PUNJAB VETERINARY COLLEGE, LAHORE. The following report has been received from the Principal of the College, for the official year 1902-03 :2 The difference between the intelligence displayed by the civilian and military students is marked in many cases, and is due solely to the fact that, as a rule, the military men have received very little primary education. Those military men who had satisfactory primary education passed very well. The majority of the military students, however, did badly in all the examina- tions. I have addressed the Director of Land Records and Agriculture, Punjab, on the subject of remedying this unsatisfactory state of affairs. It is very necessary that something should be done, as some Regiments are very short of Veterinary Assistants and need them badly. With regard to the Civilian students selected by the Principal, it will be seen that the result of the year's work has been very good, for out of 10 scholarship holders, in the 1st Year's Class, one only, who had not been selected by us but nominated by a District Board, failed. In Class B, out of 15, 2 failed, one of whom was nominat- ed by a District Board; and in Class C, out of 8, only 1 failed, This gives about 87.87 of passes. The Military students, however, did badly. In the 1st Year, there were 13 failed out of 26, or 50 per cent. In the 2nd Year, 10 failed out of 21 or 47.6 per cent., and in the 3rd Year, 3 failed out of 11, or 27.27 per cent. Our results therefore should be judged in accordance with these facts. I have addressed the Punjab Government on the subject of holding ex- aminations at shorter intervals than one year. I consider it a very great hard- ship that a man who fails for a few marks only in one subject should be condemned to pass another whole year in the College, and be practically on the same footing as a man who has failed badly in two or three subjects. Although the results of the year's teaching work are generally good, still they are not up to the average, and I consider that the men should have been better taught than they were, especially in the 2nd Year's Class. The remark made by the examiner on Soundness and Age and the de- tection of lameness, is, doubtless, more or less justifiable, as is also the remark about the teaching of Handling of Animals. I am conscious of the fact that in some of the subjects which had to be taught, sufficient instruction was not given. But this is the fault of the system and not of the teaching staff of the College, and the reason for it is not far to seek. The European Professor was removed from his duties on the 6th of January 1902, and no one was sent to replace him until 27th of October 1902, when I had to report by telegram that the work was at a standstill before any assistance was given me, and this, not- withstanding the fact that in last year's annual report the following passage occurs "It will, of course, be impossible for us to now teach the five extra" "subjects, especially without the services of a qualified and hardworking Pro-" "fessor who has a good knowledge of the language permanently appointed to the" "College." When it is considered that the subjects taught have been increased from 4 to 7 and that the number of students has risen from 83 to 119, whilst, not only has no addition been made to the teaching staff, but the Professor has been removed for about 10 months, and the Principal expected to perform the extra duties in addition to his own, the wonder is not that the results were not up to the average, but that the work could have been carried on at all. But whatever the results are, it does not appear to me that students sent here for education, and paying fees, or, at any rate, spending precious time, should suffer from the weakness of the teaching staff, and it is only just to them that this should be maintained in a state of efficiency. Even with the assistance of a permanent European Professor who is capable of lecturing in Urdu, as few are, it is observed, that the Board of Examiners consider that the subjects which the Principal has to teach are far too many and recommend the appointment of a 3rd European Pro- fessor, could a suitable man be obtained. With this, I agree. Teachers well acquainted with the subject and with the art of teaching, and suffi- cient knowledge of Urdu to teach in that language are not very easily ob- tained. I have in previous reports alluded to this subject, and again repeat that the language qualification is absolutely necessary in a vernacular teach- ing institution such as this is; and it is of little use appointing a man who does not possess this qualification in addition to a good knowledge of the subjects he is to teach.
3 Dressers' Course. In addition to the ordinary teaching work, a class of 30 Transport Dressers was sent to be trained at this College Hospital. All of them completed the three months' course on the 1st October last. Post Graduate Course. In order to assist the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Provincial Circle, 15 men were taken into the College, for a Post Graduates Course of three months. Thus two extra courses were held here during the year. Entrance Examination. The Entrance Examination was held on the 20th April 1903. The competition for entrance was much below the average, only 57 candidates against 134. Two Entrance passed presented themselves and, as well as 3 paying students, were admitted. This failing off is noteworthy and is to be accounted for by the severity of the examinations and the length of time required to gain the diploma. A good deal of it is attributable to the fact that a certificate can be far more easily obtained at another vernacular teaching school after a two years' course and an examination which is not comparable to our old two years' one. Here again the system is to blame. Very great injustice results to the graduates of this College by allowing men to be given a diploma after two years study under the old rules, whilst our men undergo a more severe examination and spend at least three years here. I have addressed the Inspector-General, Civil Veterinary Department, on the subject and something may be done to regulate the issue of diplomas or certificates and to place all teaching establishments on the same footing. The present position is untenable and must end in disaster. Receipts and amount outstanding. Appendix IV shows receipts and amount outstanding at the close of the year. The amount paid into the Treasury was Rs. 5,348-11-6 against Rs. 3,852-15-0 last year. There has therefore been a satisfactory increase, the amount realised being higher than in any previous year since the foundation of the College. Work done in the Ve- terinary College Hospital. The in-door Equine patients show an increase of four over last year. The practice has thus been normal but there were 299 paying patients against 110 last year. The outdoor Equine patients numbered 2,669, an increase of 702 against last year. This is satis- factory. The in-door cattle and other patients numbered 82, an increase of 58 over last year. Out-door cattle and other patients numbered 1,920, an increase of 313 over last year. The number of examinations for soundness, during the year, was 89. Punjab Light Horse Chargers and Police remounts were examined free of charge. The number of horses shod in the forge was 1,077 against 809 last year or an increase of 268. Shoeing Smiths' Class. The Shoeing Class was much enlarged, 18 men being admitted to it, and all passed satisfactorily. We have admitted 15 more. Certain improvements have been made in the teaching of this class and an extra farrier has been sanctioned. Horses belonging to gariwalas are now shod at a nominal charge, thus giving more practice to apprentices. I have received good reports of the military men who have passed the course. The students now at the College comprise:4 Establishment and con- tingent expenditure. Appendix V is a statement of establishment and contingent expenses, showing a slight increase of Rs. 580 in the Imperial Reve- nue owing to the increase in the Principal and Professor's salaries, vide Government of India Gazette Notification Nos. 371 and 394, dated 25th April 1903, over last year. There is also an increase of Rs. 360 in the Provincial Revenue owing to the increments given to the Native teaching staff. In regard to the item "diet of College bullocks and horses," it is to be explained that a greater number of animals kept for practical training were fed during the year, and hence the increased expenditure under this head. As regards the "purchase and repair of furniture," I have to remark that the new Lecture Theatre was completely furnished, which accounts for the increased expenditure under this head. Under other heads, there is a slight falling off. There is an increase under "Laboratory apparatus," which is due to the fact that an unforeseen and unbudgetted expenditure on account of cost of stores, &c., obtained from Europe, occurred. A strict supervision and check was kept to more or less meet the increased expenditure thus in- curred. The increase in "Book binding," was on account of a greater number of Library books and Periodicals bound during the year. General remarks. The production of Veterinary Assistants from the various Veteri- nary Schools and Colleges in India, now seems to be in excess of the demand. This is partly due to in- creased production and partly also to less demand, owing to reduction of establishment in some of the Subordinate Civil Veterinary Departments. The demand for men will, in future, I think, be less than heretofore and the desirability of limiting the production, especially of two years' course men, and the Salutri Class is now under consideration. It is not much use training men if we have no employment to give them, and it would be better to leave them as agriculturists on the land than to train them to a profession when no employment is forthcoming, thus adding to the number of the unemployed. During the year, 34 men have returned from service in South Africa, all of them with excellent testimonials from the Veterinary Officers and others under whom they have served. They have done excellent work and greatly added to the credit of this institution. I have received from Senior Officers in the Army Veterinary Department, reports testifying to the professional skill and excellent training the men showed. It was pro- mised to these men that, in consideration of their volunteering for active service at a time when they were urgently needed, they would be given first claim on any appointments which were vacant on their return. So far, however, only 10 have got employment, all through this office. I am sorry to say that, on the outbreak of the Somali operations, men of the Salutri Class from the Bombay Veterinary School, who, I suppose, had never seen a camel and who had no experience, were employed, although men who had excellent reports and had seen over two years' service, volun- teered for the work. A representation has been made to the authorities on this subject, as the system seems defective somewhere. One man has been sent to Rhodesia, two to the Andamans and one to Somaliland with the Punjab Mounted Infantry. The Vernacular Veterinary Journal has been kept up, and its cir- culation doubled. The following text-book has been prepared during the year:5 younger Colleges. Although at times despondent and inclined to take other service, old associations and pride in the institution they have helped to build up have proved too strong and they have worked well. The clerical Establishment has also worked very hard, especially the translator, who, as usual, had his hands full of work, which has been satisfactorily performed. I am very glad to say that, in recognition of the good services ren- dered by him, the Government has been pleased to confer upon Syed Sardar Shah Gilani, the title of " Khan Sahib," which has been much appre- ciated by the Department, and has given great satisfaction to us, espe- cially because he recipient of the title is a graduate of this College as well as a teacher in it. Remarks by Director of Land Records. It is only necessary for me to and a few remarks on Veterinary Major Pease's report. The results of the examination are un- satisfactory as regards the 1st and 2nd year students, but the explanation offered shows that the teaching staff is not to blame. It is very regrettable that the Principal was left for nine months without a European Assistant. The Civil Veterinary Department is a small one, and this was doubtless unavoidable, but it is to be hoped that the Inspector-General will be able to let us have a European Assistant continuously in future. I would invite particular attention to the repeated representations of the Principal that an intimate knowledge of the vernacular is indispensable. The addition of a third Professor will probably have to be considered when the Contageous Disease Ward is opened. The attention of the authorities in the United Provinces and in the Remount Department should be drawn to the remarks in paragraph 5 of the report of the Board of Examiners as to the care which should be exercised in the selection of men sent to the College. The failure of the Military Students, and the question of the native Professors' pay have already been referred to Government, and are under con- sideration. A fourth native Professor was added in the spring. Permission has recently been received to re-examine, in the summer term, those Students who failed only in one subject at the April examination. The existence of Colleges where diplomas can be more easily obtained, and the consequent falling off in the number of candidates for admission to the Lahore College, is a matter which calls for early attention. The remedy should not be difficult. The diplomas should show clearly the standard of education which they represent, and those departments which employ Veteri- nary Assistants should be given clear information as to the classes of diplomas granted at the various Colleges, to enable them to select the best men for the better paid appointments. There is nothing on record to show that the Veterinary Assistants who went to South Africa were promised the first claim on any appointments which should be vacant on their return. But they certainly deserve favourable treatment, and, in reply to their representation, they have been assured that their applications will receive full consideration. Their good service in South Africa is very gratifying to the Institution where they have received their training. I think the Principal is unduly pessimistic as to the future demand for Veterinary Assistants, for there are indications that there will be an early expansion of Veterinary Departments in all parts of India. Having regard to all the difficulties which Veterinary Major Pease has had to contend with, I think that the results of the year's work are satisfactory.
6 PART II. CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT PROVINCIAL REPORT. Preliminary. As in the preceding year, we have had three circles throughout the year under report. The North and South Circles have confined Preliminary. their attention to horse breeding, and the officer in charge of the North Punjab Circle has retained charge of the Frontier Pro- vince, under the directions, so far as that Province is concerned, of the Revenue Commissioner. The statistics included in this Report are only for the Punjab. Veterinary Captain Oliver was in charge of the North Punjab Circle throughout the year. Veterinary Lieutenant A. Smith was Superintendent of the South Punjab Circle up to the 24th October 1902, when he was succeeded by Mr. Oliver, M.R.C.V.S. The third, or Provincial Circle, has been in charge of Veterinary Captain Walker. I.7 III.8 " of it on the spot. An inspecting staff is absolutely necessary for the proper " "performance of this work, and for supervising large outbreaks when several " " Veterinary Assistants are employed. With a proper staff and a supply of" " serum we can deal, I believe, with rinderpest, and, possibly, in the near " " future with other scourges in the same way. The greatest number of inocula-" " tions took place in the Ferozepore, Lahore and Rawalpindi Districts, and the " " following Veterinary Assistants deserve credit for good work in this connect " tion :9 "almost invariable history of an outbreak of hæmorrhagic septicaemia is that" " several animals are suddenly attacked, of which the great majority die in " " from 2410 Remarks by Director of Land Records. The increase in the mortality among cattle may be partly due to disease having been more generally reported, and may be more apparent than real. The extreme importance of receiving prompt information is evident from Veterinary Captain Walker's remarks on hæmorrhagic septicaemia. The matter lies ultimately in the hands of the people themselves, and of the lambardárs and patwáris. The patwári by the Patwári rules must, at once, inform the Tahsildar, who telegraphs to the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Provincial Division. The Tahsildar informs the Veterinary Assistant concerned and the patwári also sends him information, if he is in his kánúngo circle. I think the lambardár and patwári are the best channel of information, and I shall issue a reminder to Deputy Commissioners asking them to impress on lambardárs the serious consequences of delay, where the disease is one for which serum is available, and the necessity for seeing that patwáris transmit prompt reports of outbreaks of disease. At the same time I must express my concurrence with Veterinary Captain Walker that our Depart- ment is undermanned, having regard to the work which is before it, and to the relief which it could afford if we had a sufficient number of Veterinary Assistants. The pamphlet on the treatment of cattle is to form part of the curriculum in the new village schools. It is being brought to the notice of District Boards, and these are purchasing and distributing a certain number of copies. The pamphlet is issued at a popular price of six pice per copy. Veterinary Captain Walker has endeavoured to give simple directions as to the management and treatment of cattle, and the recognition of diseases, and his book should prove of the greatest use to all cattle owners whom it may reach. Rinderpest inoculations have increased from 1,279 to 24,457. We also have 3,029 inoculations for anthrax. It is satisfactory to see that inoculation is, on the whole, readily accepted, and that its benefits are beginning to be recognised. The knowledge, which is being acquired of the various cattle diseases which scourge the country, is a striking proof of the necessity which existed for a Department solely devoted to cattle. The papers on dourine have been submitted to the Financial Com- missioner. IV.11 Cattle Shows. " I have submitted separate reports on the Shows at which money " "from the Government of India was granted, and at " " which I officiated as a judge. Prize money judiciously " " distributed is no doubt an incentive to the zamindár to take more in-" " terest in his stock, and money spent for this purpose by local bodies is" " well spent. In connection with the revision of the revenue circulars" " (veterinary) some suggestions with regard to cattle breeding and agricul-" " tural shows have been made and are under consideration. It would be" " premature to discuss them in this report." Remarks by Director of Land Records, The supply of bulls is of very pressing importance, partly on account of the necessity for State aid in the matter, and partly because our old system for the supply of bulls has temporarily broken down. We have hitherto looked to the Hissar Farm for our supply ; but we obtained none last year, and I am in- formed none will be available this year. A few may be available in 1904, but we must wait until 1905 before the Farm will be in a position to supply bulls in any number. I am of opinion that almost all the bulls issued to districts in the past are now so old that they are of no use for breeding purposes. The present views of Veterinary Officers are that the Hissár bull is not generally suitable for distribution in the North Punjab where the breeds are quite distinct and should be maintained. The Jhelum breed and the Kachi breed are particularly good for farm work, and are much valued. Our best course will probably be to establish a bull-run for the Northern Punjab (I would suggest in the Jhelum Colony) where we would breed bulls, and also keep young bulls acquired by purchase until they are old enough to issue to districts. It may be necessary to have a similar institution in the South Panjáb. Cattle breeding is, however, too large a subject to be handled in a report of this kind. The matter is being taken up by the In- spector-General, Civil Veterinary Department, and will come up in due course. V.12 Equipment of Veterin- ary Assistants. " The equipment of Veterinary Hospitals and itinerating men is proceed-" " ing fairly satisfactorily. It requires a lot of attention to " " detail, but the matter is being dealt with in a systematic " " manner, and I hope the work will soon run smoothly. In this connection also " " the help of an inspecting staff will be most advantageous. In the majority of " " cases. District Boards have met my proposals for a fixed allotment for equip-" " ment, but some have been unable to do so for want of funds. I have not yet" " been able to make a satisfactory arrangement for the transport of medicines " " and instruments in the districts, but the matter is now under the consideration " " of Government in connection with the travelling allowances of Veterinary " " Assistants." Temporary Veterinary Dispensary at Delhi Dar- bár. "A temporary Veterinary Dispensary was established at the Delhi Corona-" " tion Darbár from December 15th to January 15th on" " a site allotted for the purpose by the Central Cemmittee." " Sixteen in-patients and 617 out-patients were treated dur-" " ing that period. Rs. 500 were sanctioned for instru-" "ments and medicines for this dispensary, and, out of this, a sum of Rs. 225-6-6 was " " recovered by sale of instruments and unexpended drugs to District Boards, and " " credited to Government. A further sum of Rs. 54-5-6 is still owing and will " " be credited to Government on receipt. In addition, a sum of Rs. 300 was " " provided for chappars and miscellaneous charges, out of which Rs. 33-7-10 were " " spent. The total cost of this dispensary to the Provincial Government there-" " fore was Rs. 253-12-4. A temporary chappar was erected for in-patients and " " paid for by the Central Committee." I entirely approve of the touring scheme proposed by the Superinten- dent, Provincial Circle. The Veterinary Assistants will do much more good by visiting the larger villages and staying a few days in each, than by flying round their subdivisions. The question of travelling allowance, is now, I trust, on a satisfactory basis, a fixed monthly allowance of Rs. 10 having just been sanc- tioned for each itinerating man. This sum is to cover expenses of transport of medicines. VI.13 much to be regretted, for the tendency will be for us to get somewhat in- ferior men. But District Boards which provide the pay of almost the entire staff, could not, I fear, afford to contribute much more than they do at present. VII.14 The Army Remount Department will control horse breeding both by Imperial and District Board Agency, in the ten most important districts and in the Chenab Colony. Our North and South Circles, which were concerned solely with horse breeding, will, presumably, be abolished. The Provincial Circle will have to supervise a certain amount of horse breeding by District Boards in 17 districts, but its first care will be cattle breeding and the treatment and prevention of cattle disease, A second officer will be required for the Punjab, and a scheme has already been submitted for the reorganization of the superior establishment. The proposal includes the location of the head-quarters of both officers at Lahore, which would enable us to greatly improve the efficiency of the present head office, and thereby relieve the Superintendent of much of the clerical work, with which he is burdened, and give him more time for more important work. Our subordinate service will have to be reorganised, and this will be taken up as soon as the separation is complete. I think that the thanks of Government are due to Veterinary Captain Walker for the energy and tact which he has shown in the arduous task before him, and also to Veterinary Major Pease and Mr. Oliver and Veterinary Captain Trydell for the good work done by them during the year.

CONTENTS OF REPORT Para. Subject. Pages. PART I.2 Para. Subject. Pages. Section IV.Proceedings of the Hon'ble the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab in the Revenue and Agricultural (General) Department, No. 1631 S., dated 23rd August 1904. READ3 9. The remarks in Part IV of the Report on the importance of having bulls selected to suit the varying wants of different localities are worthy of the attention of District Officers. It will be interesting to note whether the offer of the Deputy Commissioner of Hissar to provide Brahmini bulls from the Cattle Farm is largely taken advantage of. The proposal to establish a bull-run in the Jhelum Canal Colony is now under the consideration of the Local Government. 10. Satisfactory progress was made during the year in the development of Veterinary Hospitals and Dispensaries, and good work was done by the itinerating Veterinary Assistants. The number of Assistants was increased, and with a view to their more effective control a new grade of six Veterinary Inspectors was sanctioned. By the arrangement introduced at the end of the year there are to be at the head of the Provincial Department two Superintendents, of whom the more junior will, at any rate at first, carry on his work in subordination to the other. The department as an agency for dealing with the improvement of the breed of cattle and the prevention and cure of disease has undoubtedly been strengthened by its reorganization, and the Lieutenant-Governor looks forward with confidence to a continued expansion of its operations. 11. The thanks of Government are due to Veterinary-Captain Walker for an excellent year's work, and the services of Captain Trydell and Mr. Oliver are also deserving of recognition. The Director of Land Records, Mr. Renouf, has devoted much interest and attention to this branch of his duties. ORDER.Part I.2 at the end of June. I attribute these very excellent results to the whole staff having worked with exceptional zeal and energy, to the presence of a European Professor capable of taking his share in vernacular teaching, and to the annually increasing higher standard of education amongst the students. As compared with the previous year, the Military students did exceptionally well. The worst students are those nominated by districts or others. In many cases these are found far below the average in education, and, in others, they are unsuited physically to ever become good Veterinary Assistants. Report of the Board of Examiners. Appendix I. 11, The report of the Board of Examiners is given as Appendix I. Atten- tion to paragraph 3 is undoubtedly much required in order to cope with the increased work. Transport Dressers' Class. 12. In addition to our ordinary work, from the 1st July, a Transport Dressers' Class of 40 men was given three months' instruc- tion at the College Hospital. Entrance Examination. 13. The Entrance Examination was held on the 18th April 1904. The competition for entrance was far greater than in previous years, about 150 men presenting themselves for selection for 30 vacancies. Segregation ward. 14. The new segregation ward has been completed and brought into use during the year. Since its erection Major Pease has been in charge, and some very important work has been done in the direction of the investigation of the nature of diseases, of training men in the symptoms of contagious disease, in the use of the microscope in the diagnosis of Surra and Dourine and in the preparation of slips, &c, for examination. Dourine. 15. Work has been continued on Dourine, a disease which has been causing considerable losses amongst horses and which was first diagnosed and reported on by us last year. Reports were submitted to Government in regard to the nature and course of the disease and suggestions made for limiting its spread. As the malady is in some cases difficult to diagnose a number of horses have been admitted for observation and reported on. Careful observations have also been made with a view to the study of the disease and, if possible, to the discovery of a cure or preventive, but, so far, unsuc- cessfully. We have had altogether 42 cases of Dourine under observation during the year. Surra. 16. Another very important subject which has been brought to light is the losses which occur annually amongst camels from a disease caused also by a Trypanosoma, viz., Surra. A report on this disease has been submitted and the great danger which attends the pre- sent method of dealing with it, viz., ignoring it. pointed out. The disease causes considerable losses, much greater than is generally supposed, and is not, as a rule, diagnosed. In some animals, its course is prolonged and the animal carries the poison of the disease for a long time in its blood. At present no endeavour is made to deal with it, sick and healthy camels being grazed, herded and worked together. The disease is easily transmitted by the bite of certain flies, especially the Tabanidae. Consequently, when these flies are numerous, and diseased and healthy camels are grazed in Rukhs together where these flies prevail, it is easy to understand that the disease is spread by these flies first biting the diseased and then the healthy just as happens in the Tse Tse fly disease which closely resembles it. The disease may, in this way, be spread to other animals, and experiments have been made by us to prove how easily this can be done, by inoculating under the same conditions as are secured by the bite of a fly. It has been shown that the disease is thus readily transmitted from the camel to the pony, dog, rabbit and buffalo. In addition to this investigation, we have examined the blood of 507 animals suspected to be suffering from Surra and have found the organism in 98. The cases we have had in hospital suffering from this disease are3 Rinderpest. 17. We have had admitted for treatment eight cases of naturally contracted rinderpest and five experimental ones, for the purpose of demonstrating the use of anti-rinderpest serum to the students. Eight in-contact animals were also inoculated with A.-R. serum successfully. Glanders and Farcy. 18. Only two cases have been brought to the College during the year. These were accommodated in the ward, and the symptoms and method of using the Mallein test demonstrated to the stu- dents. Three suspicious cases of lymphangitis also received the test. Specific lymphangitis. 19. Two cases were admitted for treatment during the year and recovered. Other work. 20. In addition to the work done in this ward Major Pease has visited two studs and given opinions regarding contagious diseases. Altogether it will be seen that much good work has been done in the direction of investigating the nature of diseases, The Final Year's students have had an opportunity of learning a good deal practically about con- tagious disease and can all handle a microscope and make smears to send in for examination, &c. But before any very great progress can be made we must receive some addition to our European teaching staff as the teaching work is too heavy to allow of sufficient time being devoted to special subjects. Museum. 21. Considerable additions have this year been made to our museum. Some very good specimens having been added by gifts from members of the Department. I have specially to thank Major G. Evans who has taken much interest, although so far off as Burma, and sent such valuable specimens4 examinations for soundness during the year was 69. Punjab Light Horse chargers and Police remounts were examined free of charge. The number of horses shod in the forge was 1,239 against 1,077 last year. Receipts and amount outstanding. Appendix IV. 26. Appendix IV shows the receipts and the amount outstanding at the close of the year. The sum paid into the Treasury was Rs. 5,195-2-0 as against Rs. 5,348-11-6 in the previous year. This may be considered satisfactory, as it is practically maintaining the high increase of the previous year. Establishment and con- tingent expenditure. Ap- pendix V. 27. The statement of establishment and contingent expenditure shows an increase of Rs. 4,321 over last year under Imperial Revenues owing to the increase in the Principal's and Professor's salaries, vide Government of India Circular Nos. 2283 to 2290, dated Calcutta, 28th December 1903. There is also an increase of Rs. 2,712 under Provincial Revenues owing to the increments given to the native teaching staff, and increase of establishment in the new segregation ward which has been working during the year. Increases under the heads " Hospital Requisites," "Country Medicines," " Purchase of Ponies," " Dissecting room charges," "Water works," and " Hot and cold weather charges " are due to the new Segregation Ward Hospital, and to experimental research on such diseases as Dourine and Surra. The increase under the head " Final Examination Expenses " is accounted for by the fact that in the previous year only First and Second Year Classes were examined. The increase in the head " Forge maintenance " is partly due to the increased number of farriers, admitted to the Farriers' Class, and partly to the dearness of charcoal and iron. The correspondence, both telegraphic and written, in connection with " Dourine," "Surra" and Veterinary Assistants' employment has been considerable during the year. Railway freight, on account of stores from Europe with a considerable amount paid for cartage, &c., of stores and stationery, has increased the expenditure under the head " Miscellaneous Charges." Demand for Veterinary Assistants. 28. Since last year there has been a vast improvement in the demand for Veterinary Assistants, and I am glad to be able to report that not only have all the men who returned from South Africa now been provided for, but I have applications for a great number of men and none available. It was fortunate that early in the year there was a demand for men for Madras, Burma and the Central Provinces which relieved the temporary conges- tion. New fields for employment are now open to our men especially in the Remount and Transport Department and in the Central Provinces, and if we had the accommo- dation and the staff we could train and employ 20 more Civilians yearly with benefit. Our men still continue to hold their place of honor for general utility and ability, and it is very seldom that bad reports on our men reach us. Need of a third English Professor. 29. When Government has decided with reference to the amalgamation of the Ajmere School it is hoped that a third European Pro- fessor will be appointed. As it is at present the teaching is so heavy that it is with very great difficulty that any time can be found to take up original research work, which, considering the number of little-known diseases there are in this country, and the loss brought about by these diseases, is much to be deplored. Students. 30. Enquiries have been made during the year by the Central Provinces Government with a view to sending their students here to be educated as Veterinary Assistants instead of to Ajmere, and two men are being sent for training this year Similar correspondence has taken place with the North-Western Frontier Province, and two men from Kohát and Bannu have been admitted In regard to students from the Punjab there were 150 applicants for 30 vacancies. New text-books. 31. During the year under report the following text-books have been prepared and issued free of any cost to Government:5 The monthly Journal also continues to flourish without any aid from Government. Main results for the year. Appendix VI. 32. Appendix VI shows the main results of the Punjab Veterinary College. The Native teaching staff. 33. I am pleased to be able to repeat Major Pease's remark made in the last Annual Report, viz., to testify to the good work done by the Native teaching staff throughout the year. We are fortu- nate in having on the staff of this College men of considerable ability and influence who have undoubtedly largely contributed to our present state of excellence. They have worked with zeal and have, of their own free will and in their own spare time, contributed largely in the preparation of vernacular text-books. Although the work of this College, owing to the introduction of the three years' system and the addition of several new subjects in the curriculum, has increased very consider- ably, the status and pay of our teaching staff has not increased as I am thoroughly convinced they deserve. In considering the pay of teachers of this College it must always be borne in mind that they have not the same opportunities of adding to their incomes by private practice as men of corresponding position in the medical profession. In addition, I consider that at least three men should be in training here as assistants to the teachers of such subjects as Anatomy, Chemistry and Pharmacy and Bovine Medicine and Surgery. To teach these subjects thoroughly, a considerable experience is essential, and should either of the present teachers of these subjects want to go on leave or retire, I do not know from where or how men could be obtained to replace them. This is a state of affairs I con- sider very unsatisfactory from every point of view and it requires early attention. The clerical establishment. 34. The clerical establishment has done well. The Head Clerk, who is also the Translator, must be specially mentioned. The work of a Translator at this College is considerable. In addition to other text-books translated by him, he is now engaged in translating and producing, in the vermicular, a text-book on " Shoeing." Remarks by the Director of Land Records. 35. The examination results are very satisfactory, showing a marked improvement on last year when the College was handicapped by the absence of the English Professor. The Veterinary Assistants sent out by the College continue to add to its high reputation. There is now a much greater demand for passed men than can be met, and the competi- tion for admission to the College courses is very keen. Care should, I think, be exercised to confine selection to the type of men who has done so well in the past. With reference to paragraph 10, I shall address districts and ask them to endeavour to send nominees who have a sufficient educational qualification. The case of Kángra is a special one. It is desirable to obtain local men for service in Kángra, and the District Board have accordingly provided three close Scholarships. I hope that the Kángra men will do better next year. The Principal should be requested to submit such revised rules for the Wace Scholarships as he thinks suitable. Administrative sanction has recently been obtained for the building of a dog hospital. The experience which Veterinary Assistants will derive from this branch of the College will be of considerable value to them in their professional career. It has now been decided to amalgamate the Ajmere Veterinary College with the Punjab Veterinary College, and, as a result, the third European Pro- fessor so often asked for will be provided. The question of the numbers and pay of the Native staff will be considered as well as the extensions required on account of the increase in the number of students. A separate report has been submitted to Government on these points. The sphere of utility of the College has been extended by the formation of the new segregation ward, and excellent work appears to have been done. Major Pease held charge of the office of Principal during the year under report.
6 Part II.7 provided. This leads up to the subject of the liability for the extra cost. It is clear that the number of stallions now maintained by District Boards is inadequate. The number required will be somewhere between this and the total number in the districts before the Imperial Department withdrew its stallions. It must also be admitted that District Boards are not in a position to increase their expenditure appreciably, if at all. I submit that the interests at stake being Imperial or Provin- cial rather than local, there is a good case for assistance. This is not, however, the occasion for a detailed discussion of the situation, or of the measures which should be taken. I have made enquiries and discussed the question with the Superinten- dents, but I have deferred any further action at present, as I understand that the matter is engaging the attention of the Inspector-General of the Civil Veterinary Department. The class of stallion re- quired in the non-selected districts. 40. Mr. Oliver has expressed himself in favour of Arab ponies for im- proving the indigeneous breed, and he writes :8 all causes in comparison with last year, the greatest mortality being noticeable under the head " other diseases " which are responsible for as many as 5,324 deaths out of 6,887 attacked. This increase seems to be partly due to the fact that the year under report was an unfavourable one as regards cattle disease owing to heavy rainfall, and partly to the Veterinary Assistants having been able to supply more accurate information. Still, in my opinion, some outbreaks are probably not reported. Owing to the transfer of 34 men to the Army Remount Department, 8 of whom were employed in connection with cattle disease, this important work has suffered to some extent. In addition, certain duties in connection with Imperial horse breeding were for a portion of the year performed by men whose services had previously been entirely at the disposal of this branch and possibly their legitimate work suffered. By the end of the year under report, however, practically all the Imperial stallions were disposed of and the subordinate staff of this department will now devote themselves to work in connection with cattle disease, and perform the minor duties connected with District Horse Breeding in non-selected districts. As the subordinate staff increases and the areas of circles become smaller, a better position in this respect can be hoped for, Revised rules for dealing with contagious diseases. 45. Revised rules for dealing with contagious disease have been approved and incorporated in an Agricultural Circular. Regarded from the European point of view they err on the side of leniency. In course of time and as education progresses stricter lines can be drawn. Pamphlet on cattle dis- ease and its prevention. 46. Four thousand copies in Urdu of the pamphlet " Muháfiz-i-Sahat-i- Maweshi" have been taken by the Director of Public Instruc- tion, and it is presumed that the work will be adopted as a text-book in village schools. The importance of educating agriculturists in methods of dealing with cattle disease cannot be overrated as a factor in clearing the way for measures in the future. Rinderpest and prevent- ive inoculation. Appendix VII. M. 47. Three thousand eight hundred and ninety-six cases of rinder- pest were reported during the year against 2,710 the year before, of which about one-half died. Preventive inoculations against this disease were performed in 132 villages. The number of inoculated animals is smaller than last year, being 16,480 against 24,457. This is accounted for by the fact that serum was not obtainable on several occasions when it was applied for. I under- stand that there has been a great demand for serum all over the country, I had to refuse 10 applications from Veterinary Assistants for more than 13,000 doses as the Imperial Bactereologist could not meet my demands. It will be seen that 24 deaths occurred after inoculation. At the village of Bhopur in the Siálkot District, 5 deaths occurred. I visited the scene myself and ascertained that the disease was of a particularly virulent type. When the mortality percentage of an outbreak is large it follows that the dose of serum must be fixed higher than when the disease is of a mild type. In this particular case, the serum had been subjected to great heat also and had no doubt lost some of its power. Under my orders, the dose had been considerably increased but perhaps this was not sufficient. I incline to the opinion that the dose of serum would have been sufficient had not the disease been particularly virulent. The question of fixing the dose of serum will always be rather a difficult one in this country. The virulence of the disease varies in an extraordinary manner in different outbreaks and the fact that serum deteriorates quickly in the heat of the plains complicates matters. Veterinary Assistants receive very explicit instructions in these matters, but acci- dents are occasionally unavoidable. In spite of a few drawbacks the utility of the method is unquestionable, and, in the Punjab, the results have so far been excellent. On the whole, inoculations have been well received and even welcomed. I have pleasure in reporting progress in the Kángra District which I mentioned last year as backward. The Deputy Commissioner (Mr. Younghusband, c.s.) has taken a personal interest in the matter and my thanks are due to him for his assistance. The supervision of inoculation work has received as far as possible my personal attention; but an inspecting staff is essential. Cold storage of serum. 48. The question of storage of serum is under consideration. I made a temporary arrangement last hot weather in my office with some success, as shown by a daily temperature chart. It is practically impossible to keep serum cool in transit in the districts. When it is subjected to great heat, the dose is always increased.
9 Anthrax. Appendix VII, L. 49. During the year under report there were 477 cases of anthrax reported, of which 467 died. Last year's mortality statement showed 4,787 cases and 4,227 deaths. The reason of this apparent fall in figures is that this year the figures for h10 of Lahore city and on the Ráwalpindi-Kohála dâk line, is now dealt with in selected districts by the Army Remount Department. Surra. 57. Ninety-eight cases of surra were reported from 10 districts, of which Ferozepore alone is responsible for 74 cases with 25 deaths. Dourine." 58. A case of " dourine " was detected in a village in the Chúnián Tahsil of the Lahore District and duly reported to the Army Remount Department. Remarks by the Director of Land Records. 59. The Superintendent has been hampered during the year by the changes consequent on the formation of the Army Remount Department, and by the short supply of rinderpest serum available. The inspecting agency which he asks for will be furnished by the six Inspectors who have recently been sanctioned, one being for each division and one for the headquarters office. Captain Walker's notes show that valuable enquiries are being made into the various cattle diseases which prevail in the Province. The opportunities for personal observation of epidemics will be increased now that we have two English Veterinary Officers whose attention is mainly given to cattle. IV.11 Bull-run in the Jhelum Canal Colony. 65. A scheme for the establishment of a bull-run on the Jhelum Canal Colony has been submitted and is now under consideration. Cattle shows. 66. Separate reports on the shows at which money from Imperial Funds was given and at which I officiated as Judge have been sub- mitted. A report on this subject has been called for by the Government of India, and a copy of my letter to the Inspector-General on the subject was sent to you. The question of the continuance of the Imperial grant is under consideration and need not be discussed in this report. Remarks by the Director of Land Records. 67. Captain Walker has recorded some interesting notes on the subject of cattle breeding. He gave special attention to this point in the course of his winter tours, in connection with the proposal to establish a bull-run in the Jhelum Colony, for the northern districts. For various reasons, progress has been somewhat slow with the bull-run scheme, but a detailed scheme has recently been submitted to the Local Government, and I hope that it will be possible to make a start by the end of the current year. I was able to attend the Lyallpur and Choa Saidan Shah Fairs, at both of which there was an excellent show of cattle. The latter fair deserves special mention on account of the exceptionally keen competition in the bull classes. The Salt Range cattle, commonly known as the Dhanni breed, are in great demand for plough purposes throughout the Northern Punjab and have been recommended for distri- bution from the proposed Jhelum Colony Bull-run. The Choa Saidan Shah Fair was only initiated a few years ago by Mr. Agnew, the Deputy Commissioner of Jhelum, Thanks to the close interest which he has taken in it, it has already done much to increase the local interest in cattle breeding. V.12 The Amritsar Veterinary- Hospital. 71. During the year, the Municipal Veterinary Hospital at Amritsar, which was formerly controlled by the Municipality, was placed under the charge of this Department. It will be seen from Appendix VII. K. that by this change the Municipality has saved Rs. 523 in comparison with last year. The Simla Veterinary Hospital. 72. The Imperial Veterinary Hospital at Simla has been taken over as a provincial institution from April 1st, and it is probable that during the year 1904-05 a Veterinary Hospital will be built to take the place of the present temporary quarters. Treatment on tour in villages. Appendix VII. N. 73. The number of animals treated by itinerating Veterinary Assistants is shown in Appendix VII. N. During the year, 33,517 animals were so treated against 30,939 last year. Itinerating men are now equipped with an approved pattern of saddle bags which they take with them on tour. When Veterinary Inspectors are appointed, Veterinary Assistants will have their tours approved beforehand and they should then be made in a more systematic manner. Fees and charges. 74. An attempt has been made to establish a uniform scale of fees and charges at veterinary institutions in districts. The charges have been fixed at the lowest possible rate and barely cover the actual cost of medicines. Charges are now to be levied from all persons who pay income-tax, the principle adopted being that they can well afford payment. The new schedule of fees was promulgated with the Director of Land Records' Circular No. 2 of 1903. Deviations from the standard rates are permissible with the previous sanction of the Director of Land Records where these are necessitated by special local conditions. The new system was adopted in July, and in some places at a later date. The revenue at Veterinary Hospitals under this heading is shown in Appendix VII. K. In addition thereto, Rs. 191-8-9 were realised on account of fees, &c., at some Veterinary Dispensaries. Remarks by the Director of Land Records. 75. It is to be regretted that unforeseen expenditure on plague has caused delay in the provision of a hospital building at Ráwalpindi. From the experience gained at Amritsar, Ferozepore and other places, I am confident that a hospital will supply a real want at Ráwalpindi, as it would in any other station where there is considerable wheeled traffic, and where there are a large number of well-to-do English and native residents. I am informed by the Deputy Commissioner that the institution will be opened during the current year. In the meanwhile, no appointment has been made as yet to the post of Veterinary Assistant sanctioned for the hospital. The work of the Simla Hospital is at present carried on in two hired rooms in the bazár. There is pressing need of buildings with stabling accommodation to enable the Veterinary Assistant in charge to keep cases under his immediate super- vision. It is also very important that a central position should be secured. It is hoped that the site of the bullock train office will be made available for this purpose. A Veterinary Hospital was recently sanctioned for Sargodha, and it is expected that the new hospitals at Ráwalpindi, Lyallpur and Sargodha will be opened during the current year. Captain Walker's success in obtaining dispensary accommodation for itinerating Veterinary Assistants during the ten days in each month which they spend at head-quarters is very satisfactory. As noted last year, the system of working is that a Veterinary Assistant passes ten days in each month at his head quarters and tours for the remaining twenty, visiting the largest villages and staying a certain time at each. The levy of fees from income-tax payers has not affected the attendance at hospitals. A small decrease in the number of in-patients is counterbalanced by an increase in out-patients. The system of charging those who can afford to pay the bare cost of medicine is, I think, sound and should be unobjectionable. The receipts which will accrue will, doubtless, be a welcome set-off against the expense incurred by Local Bodies. The total receipts this year amounted to Rs. 628-10-6 as against Rs. 116-6-0 in 1902-03. The new system was only in force for varying and short periods at the different hospitals, so that more reliable date will be available next year.
13 VI.14 The original organization of the subordinate department in 1901 did not achieve all that was expected of it. It was hoped that the same men would work under the Superintendent, North or South Punjab at horse breeding, as well as under the Superintendent, Provincial Circle, on duties connected with cattle. This was found impossible in practice, and. out of 96 men, 26 were detached solely for horse breeding work, leaving 70 under the Provincial Superintendent. Last summer, we transferred 34 men to the Army Remount Department, but on account of the additions described in the Superintendent's report, we now have 85 posts sanctioned for 28 districts and the 2 colonies, and these have been allotted so as to give each district a staff equivalent to that which it had before the Department was provincialised. I have no hesitation in saying that the present personnel is far superior in efficiency to the old. Most of the old unqualified men, branders, &c., have left the service and they have been replaced by men who have passed the three years' course at the Lahore Veterinary College. In addition, profes- sional supervision has been supplied which was originally almost entirely lacking. The grant of a fixed travelling allowance at Rs. 10 per month has been greatly appreciated. Although our grade rates of pay are the lowest in India, it is gratifying to record that we secured most of the men who passed out of the Veterinary College last April, and, at the time of writing, we have only 8 vacancies as against 22 on March 31st. The growing popularity of the Depart- ment is ascribable to the enhanced travelling allowance, to the chance of promotion to Veterinary Inspectorships, and to the fact that the service is home service.

CONTENTS OF REPORT. [Maximum limit fixed for text, 12 pages]. Para. Subject. Page. PART I.ii Para. Subject. Page. SECTION VI.Proceedings of His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab in the Revenue and Agricultural (General) Department, No. 2269 S, dated 11th September 1905. READ2 will be only a temporary one. The discrepancies between the figures given in Appendix VII and VIII are not explained. It would appear for example that the total number of deaths from rinderpest in Jhang and Jhelum was less than that of the uninoculated animals only which succumbed. 10. Good progress is being made in providing the Province with adequate accommodation in the shape of hospitals and dispensaries. His Honour observes that Municipalities appear to do very little to assist in this matter, and welcomes the offer of the Murree Committee to equip a temporary hospital during the summer months. 11. The Lieutenant-Governor awaits with interest the submission of Captain Walker's scheme for bull-breeding at Sargodha. The supply of suitable bulls is a most important matter, and the remarks on the subject in the report are interesting. Sir Denzil Ibbetson hopes that District Officers will do their best to second the efforts of the Civil Veterinary Department in the direction of improv- ing cattle-breeding. The new inspecting staff, it is anticipated, will be able to do a good deal in this direction. 12. The scheme for providing an adequate supply of stallions in the districts not selected for the operations of the Remount Department, referred to in paragraph 50 of the report, has since the close of the year been accepted by Government and by the local bodies concerned. Arrangements have been made for the purchase at the joint expense of the Imperial and Provincial Governments during the coming cold weather of the required number of animals, which will all be pony stallions. The cost of maintenance of the stallions will be borne by the District Boards. A satisfactory advance in the supply of stallion power for mule-breeding is observed. 13. The remarks made by Captain Walker on the subject of cattle-shows indicate that, judged by the number of sales registered at them, although they have in some districts proved failures, they have in others been very successful. It would be premature therefore to conclude that these shows do not supply a want, and if there is really no demand for animals in the former class of districts the remedy would appear to be to substitute for them districts in which shows are more likely to be successful. It is understood from the end of paragraph 61 of the report that the Superintendent has this in view. Whether the giving of prizes tends to encourage the improvement of stock is a question which further experience must be awaited to decide, 14. The year witnessed the introduction of the grade of Veterinary Inspectors to supply the interval between the Superintendents and the Veterinary Assistants and so provide for adequate supervision of the latter. At the same time an increase in the number of Veterinary Assistants has been arranged for at the rate of four a year until an Assistant shall have been provided for each tahsíl. 15 The useful work done by the Department during the year is a matter of great satisfaction to His Honour. He is confident that with the increased grants which will now be available for its dovelopment the scope of its operations will be markedly increased. The people of the Province are already showing that they appreciate the benefits of veterinary skill, and there is every reason to believe that the popularity of the operations of the Department will continue to develop. 16. In conclusion, His Honour desires to convey his thanks to Captain Walker and Mr. Oliver for their able control of the Department during a year of very hard work. ORDER.No. 2956. FROM E. R. ABBOTT, ESQUIRE, C.S., Offg. Director of Land Records and Agriculture, Punjab, To A. H. DIACK, ESQUIRE, C.S., Chief Secretary to Government, Pnnjab. Dated LAHORE, the 30th July 1905. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit the Annual Report on the Punjab Veterinary College and the Civil Veterinary Department of the Punjab for the year 1904-05. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, E. R. ABBOTT, Offg. Director of Land Records and Agriculture, Punjab.
Part I.2 year class on condition that they pass in the particular subject in which they had failed in the June examination. Of the other 3 failures, one Military student having failed badly in all subjects has been returned to his regiment, the other two remain for one year more. Of the 47 students who were examined in the second year class 45 or 95.74 per cent. passed the examination and 2 having failed in one subject only will be allowed to appear in the June examination when, if they pass, they will be promoted to the next senior class. Of the 39 students who were examined in the final or third year class, 32 or 82.05 per cent. passed successfully. Of the 7 failures 6 men who failed in one subject only will be re-examined in June next, and, should they pass then, will be given the diploma. One man having failed in two subjects is allowed to remain another year. These results are not so good as those of last year, which is not to be wondered at, as the Professor was left alone for five months of the year. Post graduate course. 9. Three men attended a post graduate course in contagious dis- ease and derived much benefit therefrom. Transport Dresser's class. 10. In addition to the ordinary work, from 1st July a Transport Dresser's class of 40 men was given three months' instruc- tion at the College Hospital. Shoeing Smith's class. 11. This year 11 men underwent nine months' instruction at the forge and all passed and obtained certificates as farriers. The shoeing of garriwalas' horses at a nominal rate is proving benefi- cial by giving more practice to the apprentices. Entrance Examination. 12. The Entrance Examination was held on 20th April 1905. The competition for entrance was far greater than in previous years. Over 200 men presented themselves for selection. Amongst the 85 new students admitted were 10 Entrance-passed men. Dog Hospital. 13. During the year a Dog Hospital has been built and equipped and a staff appointed to look after it. This supplies a long felt want and is proving self-supporting, the receipts being in excess of expenses. A clinical clerk's office and pharmacy room have been sanctioned during the year and are in course of construction. Treatment of contagious disease. 14. The segregation ward is proving a great success, and the result of the work done in it is excellent. In addition to the teaching which is now made of a very practical nature, work has been continued in investigation. The College is now in a posi- tion to give assistance and advice to other Departments who may require it. Numerous specimens of diseased material have been examined and reported on and many cases of Dourine, Surra, Epizootic Lymphangitis and H3 Expenditure. 16. Appendix V gives the expenditure on establishment and contingen- cies. It shows an increase of Rs. 1,911 over last year under Imperial Revenues owing to the increase in the Principal's salary as Major after 20 years' service. There is also an increase of Rs. 5,522 under Provincial Revenues partly owing to the increments given to the teaching staff and the increase of establish- ment in the new dog ward, and largely to an expenditure of Rs. 3,929 on account of cost of stores obtained from England. This expenditure was, up to last year, considered a Home charge and has never before been shown in this statement. The increase in the items "Diet of animals" and "Hospital requisites" is due to the feeding of experimental animals kept in the segregation ward for teaching purposes and increase in hospital animals rendered necessary by increase in number of students. Patients treated. 17. Appendix III shows the total number of Equine, Bovine and Canine In and Out-door patients treated in the College Hospital which was 4,950 against 4,955 last year. The number of examinations for soundness during the year was 72. Punjab Light Horse chargers and Police remounts were examined free of charge. The number of horses shod in the forge was 1,359 against 1,239 last year. Scholarships. 18. In Appendix IV the scholarships and stipends awarded are shown. The system of awarding stipends by competitive examina- tion continues to give good results. Out of 32 scholarship- holders under this system all passed. The only scholarship-holder who failed was one nominated by a District Board. The sanction of the Financial Commissioner was received at the close of the year to the amendment proposed under the rules for the Wace Scholarships by which only one scholarship of Rs. 32 will be given under Rule IV, instead of two of Rs. 16, to a student who has passed his final examination at the Veteri- nary College on condition of his remaining at the College for an extra year to perfect himself in veterinary practice. No such scholarship was drawn during the year under the old rules, but it is expected that candidates will always be forthcoming for this single scholarship in future. Amalgamation of Ajmere School. 19. It has been decided by the Government of India during the year to transfer the students of the Ajmere Veterinary School to Lahore and with them the teaching staff. Sanction has been given for the necessary accommodation, and no doubt with the increase of the staff still greater efficiency will be secured. Demand for Veterinary Assistants. 20. The demand for graduates is very great, all diplomaed men are at present employed. Special efforts are being made to in- crease the number of trained men turned out annually, and for this purpose the total number of students is being gradually increased, and it is hoped eventually to have 250 in training. It is interesting to note that the number of students now admitted is greater than the total number of students, in all classes at the College, in 1896. This will show that substantial progress is being made. Text-books. 21. A text-book on Shoeing by Major Pease and one on Hygiene have been translated by Lala Prabhu Lal, the Translator and Head Clerk of the College. At the request of the Supply and Transport Department a pamphlet in Urdu on Epizootic Lymphangitis also has been issued. The circulation of the Indian Veterinary Journal has increased and its popularity has been well maintained. The College Staff. 22. The Principal reports that the work done by the staff during the year has been excellent and that every teacher takes a pride in the College and does his best to keep up the good name which the Institution has earned in the past. He himself was absent on
4 leave for three months and on special duty for two of the working time, and hence Captain Smith has been alone in the charge of the College during the greater part of the year and to him therefore and the native teaching staff is mostly due the credit for the results obtained. Every possible assistance has been given by all the teachers, one of whom S. Sirdar Shah, K.S., took over Major Pease's lectures during his absence. The Principal brings especially to notice the work of Lala Prabhu Lal whose duties have been largely increased by the increase in the number of students and of Departments in the College. Main results of the year. 23. Appendix VI (Provincial Table No. 1) shows the main results of the Punjab Veterinary College. Remarks by the Direct- or of Land Records and Agriculture, Punjab. 24, The results of the examinations, though not so good as in the previous year, are in the circumstances detailed by the Principal in paragraph 8 highly satisfactory. It will be noticed that out of 153 men examined in all three classes only 4 failed in more than one subject. The excellent prospects before gradu- ates of the College are sufficiently indicated both by the fact that they at once find employment and also by the continually increasing competition for entrance. The long discussed amalgamation of the Ajmere Veterinary School has now been carried out and, with the increase in pay and number of the in- structorial staff and in accommodation that has been afforded, the utility of the College will be enhanced. Major Pease has given generous testimony to the labours of Captain Smith and the native teaching staff. Captain Smith was in charge of the College without European assistance for the greater part of the year, and both he and Major Pease are to be congratulated on the excellence of the results achieved. Part II.5 and North-West Frontier Province, and performed the work of Superintendent in addition. Captain Walker on rejoining from leave on 11th February 1905, took over the duties of Superintendent from Mr. Oliver. SECTION II6 As usual this disease was most prevalent in Kangra District where 241 animals died. Many of the cattle in that district are very badly looked after and have not the vitality to resist severe foot and mouth disease. As stated last year this is one of the few contagious diseases in which Veterinary Assist- ants are able to render medicinal treatment. They are able to do good work in this way. Black quarter. 35. Black quarter was reported from 18 districts. The mortality of affected animals in this disease is severe. It breaks out regularly in certain villages in Hoshiarpur and Ludhiana Districts at certain seasons of the year. As foreshadowed last year, some inoculations were undertaken with a well-known prophylactic imported from abroad. Mr. Oliver reports that the inoculations were done at the request of the cattle owners with satisfactory results. The actual figures are 79 animals inoculated with one death. Forty-six uninoculated animals died during the course of the outbreaks. Applications were subsequently received from Sialkot, Hoshiarpur and Jhelum for inoculation, but they could not be complied with as under orders of the Government of India no sera or prophylactics are to be used in future unless obtained from the Muktesar Laboratory. Outbreaks visited per- sonally. 36. Mr. Oliver was able to visit outbreaks of disease in 5 districts for the purpose of diagnosis and investigation. Treatment of disease in villages. 37. Table IV shows the number of villages visited by Veterinary Assistants and the number of patients treated by them for contagious and non-coutagious diseases. Most of the cattle treated for contagious disease were treated for foot and mouth disease. As a rule Veterinary Assistants arrive too late to treat animals suffering from bæmorrhagic septicæmia or black quarter. 39,622 animals were treated as against 33,517 last year. 527 animals were castrated, 312 of these being equines. The decrease in the number of equine castrations is due to the fact that in selected districts many animals are castrated by the Veterinary Staff of the Army Remount Department, Animals treated in villages by itinerating men are shown separately from those treated at headquarters. Since the appointment of Veterinary Inspectors it is possible to exercise a greater check on the tours of the Veterinary Assistants. SECTION III.7 Equipment. 40. Both hospitals and dispensaries are now fairly well equipped, though a few exceptions must be made in the case of the latter, where funds have been scarce. Efforts are being made to remedy this defect. New institutions. 41. A new Veterinary Hospital has been built at Gujrat and it will be opened on the 1st April with a stationary man in charge. It is hoped that hospitals at Sargodha, Delhi, Rawalpindi and Multan will be started during next year. A hospital for Jullundur is under consid- eration. Proposals were made last summer .to establish temporary hospitals at Murree and Dalhousie during the summer months. The Murree Municipality has agreed to supply the necessary accommodation and funds for equipment. It is hoped that a start will be made at that place during the summer. Inspections. 42. During the year Mr. Oliver was able to inspect all the Veteri- nary Hospitals in the Province at least once. In addition, he inspected 36 Veterinary Assistants and their equipment and registers at their headquarters. Since his return from leave, Captain Walker has been able to inspect 3 Veterinary Assistants at their dispensaries. Veterinary Inspectors have done useful work in inspecting hospitals and dispensaries. Income and expenditure. 43. The expenditure and receipts at Veterinary Hospitals is shown in Table VI, which has been furnished by districts. The receipts and expenditure of Veterinary Dispensaries cannot bo shown as they are inseparable from the touring expenses. Receipts from fees and charges for medicine are shown in columns 6 and 7. Some districts have shown these items separately. With the exception of Simla, for which there is a special schedule, the charges are uniform and only persons liable to income tax are charged. The charges are very small and barely cover the cost of medicines. With regard to Veterinary Dispensaries charges are only made in certain places at the discretion of District Boards. No charges are made for work done on tour, except in very special cases. A reference to Table VI will show that at some hospitals a considerable income is obtained from fees and charges for medicine. With the exception of Feroze- pore, the receipts are much larger than last year. In that case, the charges that were previously levied were somewhat lowered when a uniform scale was prescribed. Simla is a special case and a comparatively large income is expected at that place. At Amritsar Veterinary Hospital, the control of which was taken over by this Department last year, the receipts from fees, &c., are Rs. 625 as against Rs. 379 last year, and the expenditure shows a considerable decrease. SECTION IV.8 do with that number annually. If they cannot afford to take so many, then Government aid is indicated. Petitions for bulls from agriculturists are fre- quently received, but districts seem unable to afford anything like an adequate supply. Local purchases. 46. A certain number of bulls have been purchased locally by districts in consultation with this Department. It is, however, a difficult matter to buy suitable bulls in the open market. Measures for the in- crease of supply of bulls. 47. This Province is fortunate in being able to get bulls from the Hissar Cattle Farm, which is under the Imperial Govern- ment. If the supply there is equal to the demand, the Southern Districts of the Punjab have now a satisfactory source from which suitable bulls can be obtained. A serious endeavour must be made to supply the Northern Districts for which Hissar bulls are not suitable. A scheme is on foot to provide a farm for the supply of bulls of the Dhanni breed in the Jhelum Colony at Sargodha and land has been promised for the purpose. There has been some discussion during the year whether the object of this farm should be to breed bulls or to rear purchased calves. Captain Walker is strongly in favour of bull-breeding as offering the best chance of success, though involving great expense. During the year Mr. Oliver submitted a detailed scheme which was a combination of bull-breeding through tenants and bull-rearing, but the expense involved rendered its acceptance impossible. Captain Walker is now preparing another scheme for a bull-breeding farm at Sargodha and is confident of being able to issue 50 bulls a year eventually. Pending the establishment of a farm, it may be possible to buy a few suitable bulls for the Northern Districts, though Captain Walker is not very hopeful. With a farm to send animals to, however, we shall be in a better position to buy in the open market than we have been hitherto. Breeds to be encouraged. 48. With sufficient Hariana bulls from Hissar and Dhanni bulls from Sargodha a great want will be supplied. The Sahiwal (Montgomery) breed of milch cattle, possibly one of the best breeds in the country for milk, must not be overlooked. In the near future something should be done to breed good animals of this famous stock. It may be possible to breed Sahiwal animals at Sargodha and the subject will be care- fully considered when the farm is ready for occupation. In connection with the difficulty that is experienced in fixing types, Mr. Oliver remarks: "It is almost impossible to describe or lay down correct points for a typical animal of any particular breed as all the so-called breeds seem to be so hopelessly mixed. The object then seems to be to find and select those whose character and shape approach most closely to our idea of what should be, and then by judicious breeding try and fix a type or strain that is likely to be permanent." Captain Walker's view is that we should cling to the best indigenous types as far as possible. If we breed from animals that are shapely and suited to the conditions of the locality for which they are required, we ought to produce bulls which will be of the greatest service to the residents of that locality. This is undoubtedly the correct attitude. To endeavour to improve the local breeds holds out far more hope of success than to attempt to introduce foreign (and possibly better) strains of which the owners are ignorant and secretly suspicious. SECTION V.9 Replacement of stallion power. 50. This number of stallions is of course quite inadequate. The sub- ject was referred to in last year's report and the matter has been dealt with during the year. The Inspector-Gene- ral, Civil Veterinary Department, pointed out the need for more stallion power and the Imperial Government on his recommendation proferred financial assist- ance. It is proposed to fix a standard scale of stallions for each district. A certain number of animals will be replaceable by Government and a certain number by District Boards. The maintenance of all stallions will be a district charge. The proposed standard scale is 59 ponies and 3 horses. The horses are required in the Hoshiarpur and Muzaffargarh Districts and will be country- breds or Arabs. All the ponies will be Arabs. With assistance from Imperial Funds, the Local Government propose to supply 17 ponies and 3 horses during 1905-06 in replacement of those taken away on the formation of the Army Remount Department. If these are supplied, a serious want and, in a sense, a grievance will have been removed. The scheme awaits the final sanction of the Government of India and the concurrence of District Boards. The aim is not so much to supply remounts for the army but to gradually improve the indigenous stock by the infusion of good blood and in short to supply adequate stallion power of good quality. Services of horse and pony stallions. 51. Two horses and 38 ponies were actually employed at stud during the year against 43 ponies last year. The average per horse stallion was 64 and the average per pony 68.52. Branding of mares in non-selected districts is now discontinued, and all mares that are not obviously unsuitable are allowed the services of stallions. Produce results are not available. The question of the necessity of statistics of this kind and produce certificates is under consideration. Feed and keep of horse and pony stallions. 52. The average cost of feed and keep of stallions per annum is shown in Table XII. The figures work out at Rs. 249-8 per horse and Rs. 231-11-1 per pony against Rs. 394-7-7 and Rs. 242-1-7 last year. SECTION VI.10 SECTION VII.11 and dealers will only attend fairs in localities where there is either a demand to be met, or supply to be obtained. Once established as a recognised market, a cattle fair operates to improve the breed, for the better the class of animal brought to the show for sale, the better the price obtained. This consideration influences the small breeder, whereas money prizes are usually snapped up by a few wealthy breeders who have little competition to fear. It would seem when to be a question for serious consideration whether the shows now held at Delhi, Karnal, Ambala, Shahpur, Jhaug and Muzaffargarh, at which no stock whatever changed hands, should be continued: whereas the success of the Lyallpur show indicates that a similar institution at Sargodha, where the demand for cattle must be very considerable, would produce successful results. SECTION VIII.-SUBORDINATE ESTABLISHMENT. Subordinate establish- ment. 62. The sanctioned strength of the subordinate establishment as it stood on 31st March was 96, as detailed below, in comparison with 85 last year : Veterinary Inspectors ... ... ... 6 Veterinary Assistants, 1st grade ... ... 21 12 Departments. A rapidly expanding scientific department must go through a period in which the supply of qualified men does not equal the demand, but the exten- sion of the Lahore Veterinary College and the existence of the increased demand will automatically bring the required relief.

Five thousand two hundred and forty seven patients were treated in the Veterinary College Hospital during the year, a slight increase of some 300. The rise in the number of canine patients from 21 3 10. Turning to contagious disease among cattle, the Lieutenant-Gover- nor observes that serious outbreaks of rinderpest occurred in Karnál, Shahpur and Jhang. Over half a lakh of animals were inoculated for this disease alone as against 18,000 in 1904-05, a satisfactary indication that the cattle-owner is beginning to appreciate the efforts of the department. The results of inocula- tion both in the case of rinderpest and of hæmorrhagic septicaemia were marked- ly satisfactory, and only 93 or 2 per cent. of the inoculated animals succumbed out of a total mortality of 10,000. 11. The general practice both of itinery practitioners and of the hos- pitals remained stationary, 86,000 patients being treated or operated upon. 12. The supply of bulls from the Hissar farm was not equal to the demand, and it is observed that while the reported demands do not fully represent the needs of the Province, the number of bulls employed for stud purposes fell from 265 to 256. To supplement this deficiency Captain Walker elaborated a scheme for establishing a bull breeding farm near Sargodha, estimated to pro- vide after the fifth year about 50 bulls per annum fit for breeding. The scheme received the approvement of Government during the year, but owing to practical difficulties regarding the provision of a site sufficiently near to pasture, the inception of operations had to be postponed. 13. Breeding operations among horses and donkeys in the "non- selected " districts have engaged the attention of the. Superintendent, but considerable difficulty has been experienced in obtaining an adequate number of donkey stallions. It has been represented that the Hissar farm, in view of the demands of the Army Remount Department, is unable to issue the annual number of jacks required by the "non-selected" districts. The Government of India were addressed on the subject, and have recently replied offering the province some financial assistance towards the purchase of stallions from Cyprus. 14. In conclusion Sir Charles Rivaz wishes to express his appreciation of the vigorous work done by Captain Walker and Mr. Oliver. ORDER.No. FROM W. C. RENOUF, ESQUIRE, C.S., Director of Agriculture, Punjab, To E. D. MACLAGAN, ESQUIRE, C.S., Offg. Chief Secretary to Government, Punjab. Dated the 1st August 1906. SIR, I have the honour to forward the annual combined Report on the Punjab Veterinary College and the Provincial Civil Veterinary Department for the year 1905-06. The Principal of the Punjab Veterinary College has written Part I, and the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Parts II to IV. I add the following remarks on the reports of these officers which should be read with what I have already said in the Preface and in Parts V and VI. A.2 Income and expenditure. 4. The accounts show an increase under income, due chiefly to the enhanced scale of fees which is gradually coming into force and the larger number of students. The income from the dog hospital has advanced from Rs. 341 to Rs. 756-14-0, and this institution should shortly become entirely self-supporting. The Principal will be asked to compare the income and expenditure of the dog hospital in future reports. The Principal has explained the increase in expenditure, which is the natural result of the amalgamation with Ajmere and of the extension of work in the segregation ward. Notice of officers. 5. Major Pease has had a very busy year in giving effect to the amalga- mation and in working out the details of the various build- ing extensions. He and his staff are to be congratulated on the very successful results obtained. Major Pease has drawn special attention to the good work done by Captain Baldrey. B.3 Unless some arrangement can be made, mule breeding is likely to receive a serious check in the " non-selected" districts. There would be no objection to the addition of a table showing the results of coverings. Fairs and Shows. 11. Much attention has been given to the subject of Fairs and Shows. Prize schedules have been examined and recast where neces- sary, and the Local Government has granted 20 silver medals annually for competition at Cattle Shows. Captain Walker's remarks in para- graph 68 are interesting. I think, however, that the attempt to foster Cattle Shows should be persevered with in view of the arrangements which are now being made for a regular and larger supply of bulls for breeding. Subordinate establish- ment. 12. It has been apparent for some time that our Veterinary Assistants are underpaid in comparison with those employed in other Provincial and Imperial Departments. After ascertaining the rates of pay which obtain in other departments, and discussing the question with the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, I am now submitting a scheme to raise the salaries of Veterinary Assistants serving in this Province to the average level. I am proposing grades of Rs. 30, Rs. 40 and Rs. 50 in lieu of Rs. 20, Rs. 30 and Rs. 40. Importance of camping in tents. 13. I should like to draw attention to the importance of camping in tents during the cold weather, as it is only in this way that first-hand knowledge can be obtained of the various prob- lems connected with agricultural stock. I am aware that there are difficulties at present owing to the vastness of the charges and the shortage of officers. Still, I hope that every endeavour will be made to do as much camping as possible during the coming winter. The Superintendent will be asked to note in future how many days have been spent under canvas by each officer. Notice of officers. 14. Captain Walker has been short of Assistants, and his duties have been extremely arduous with two Provincial Departments on his hands. His work has been characterised as usual by energy, thoroughness and resource. He has his department under excellent control. Question of the reten- tion of certain appendices. 15. I regret that the prescribed length of the report has been slightly- exceeded. The attention of the officers concerned will be drawn to this. The Provincial Appendices A to E have been allowed to remain. I doubt if their inclusion is permissible in view of the general orders of the Government of India on annual reports, although no objec- tion was raised last year. Appendices A and D can be referred to in the narrative, and might be omitted. But I would recommend the retention of B (Income) and E (Expenditure), and also on the whole of C (cases treated). Appendix F, giving details of the cases treated in the segregation ward, is new, but appears to be necessary as an account of the research work done during the year. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, W. C. RENOUF, Director of Agriculture, Punjab.
ANNUAL REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY ADMINISTRATION IN THE PUNJAB FOR THE YEAR 1905-06. PREFACE. General administration. The Punjab Veterinary College. 1. The Veterinary College has been fortunate in the addition of a third English Professor, and in the presence of all three English Professors throughout the year. The amalgamation with the Ajmere College has become an accomplished fact, and with the best of results in the consequent strengthening of the teaching staff. Major Pease again discharged the duties of Principal except for six weeks of the summer vacation when he officiated as Inspector-General, Civil Veterinary Department. Aa above. The Provincial Civil Veterinary Department. 2. Captain Walker held charge of the Punjab Provincial Civil Veterinary Department as well as of the North-West Frontier Pro- vince, Veterinary Department. Half of this large area comprising the Delhi, Jullundur and Multan Divisions was made over to the second Superintendent working, however, under the control of the Superintendent. Mr. Oliver was second Superintendent until the 26th of February when he was succeeded by Mr. Woodley who had been attached to the Province for training since his first appointment in October. The arduous nature of the duties involved in the administration of the two Provincial Departments has been recognized by the creation of a post of third Superintendent. This Officer will be shared by the Punjab and the North-West Frontier Province, and will have his headquarters at Rawalpindi. He will hold an independent charge in the Frontier Province. But he will be under the orders of the Superintendent Civil Veterinary Department, Punjab, as regards the Punjab. He will arrange to spend approximately half his time in each Province. Captain Walker is of the opinion that we require three officers for the Punjab alone. I agree with him having regard to the extension of work in every direction. The number of Veterinary Inspectors has been increased from 6 to 12, a measure which will result in much closer supervision over the staff of Veterinary Assistants, and in greater efficiency. Extent and duration of tours of Officers. 3. Captain Walker was 216 days on tour and travelled 1,800 miles by road and 9,465 miles by rail. He made special tours in connection with the investigation of dourine and cattle and horse-breeding in the Gurdaspur and Sialkot Districts. He attended outbreaks of disease in six districts, and inspected 10 hospitals, 19 dispensaries and 4 dâk lines. He judged at six Horse and Cattle Shows. Sargodha was visited twice and Hissar once in connection with the Bull Farm scheme and the supply of stud bulls to districts. Mr. Oliver was on privilege leave from the 4th September to the 3rd October, 1905, when his duties were discharged by the Superintendent. Mr. Oliver was 103 days on tour and travelled 1,018 miles by road and 12,307 miles by rail, visiting outbreaks of disease in six districts, inspecting 7 hospitals 26 dispensaries, and 4 dâk lines, and attending 6 Horse and Cattle Shows.
2 Mr. Woodley, in his capacity of 2nd Superintendent, has spent 24 days on tour, and travelled 269 miles by road and 1,918 miles by train. He has inspected two hospitals and ten dispensaries and attended five Horse and Cattle Shows. Stallions and stud bulls have been inspected when on tour, notes being submitted to the district officers concerned. Horse boxes and cattle trucks were examined at railway stations on occasions. Captain Walker and Mr. Oliver were members of the Board of Examiners at the Punjab Veterinary College in April. Part I.3 Curriculum of Instruc- tion. Graduate's Course. 7. During the year under report there were three classes studying in the three years' course, and one class in the new two years' course ordered by the Military authorities for the Military students. In the three years' course, the three classes were distributed as follows, on the 3lst March, 1906 :4 Report of the Examiners. Appendix A. 13. The Report of the Board of Examiners is given as Appendix A. I agree with their remarks. The buildings and teaching equipment are being annually improved, and the work has been very advantageously redistributed. The extra staff has been a great boon; some of the native staff will improve every year. They have all now passed the final examin- ation, and obtained the Graduate's Diploma. The examinations are yearly becom- ing more searching, and consequently the class of man turned out is improving. Transport dressers' class. 14. In addition to the ordinary work, a Transport dressers' class of 65 men received three months' training during the summer vacation. Entrance Examination. 15. The Entrance Examination was held on the 25th April, 1906. The com- petition for admission was this year, as usual, great, there being 240 applicants. In order to meet the demand for passed men, 95 students were admitted, of whom 19 had passed the Entrance Examination of the Punjab University. Receipts, and outstandings at the close of the year. Appendix B. 16. The sum paid into the Treasury was Rs. 8,129-2-6 against Rs. 5,831-7-11 in the previous year, or an increase of Rs. 2,297-10-7, which may be considered satisfactory. The increase has been chiefly in students' fees. The practice has been normal during the year. Number of patients treated. Appendix C. 17. Appendix C shows the total number of Equine, Bovine, Canine and other in and out-door patients treated in the college hospital and segregation ward during the year. This shows a slight increase, 5,250 against 4,950 last year. The number of examinations for soundness was 56. Punjab Light Horse chargers and Police Remounts were examined free of charge. The number of horses shod in the forge was 1,260 against 1,359 last year. Nalbands' class. 18. Nine men underwent a nine months' course of instruction in shoeing, and eight passed the examination successfully, obtaining certifi- cates as farriers. Caste of students. 19. The students in the College comprised5 pharmacy has been entirely refitted. The Professor of Sanitary Science has been provided with a new lecture room, office and laboratory on a site adjoin- ing the segregation ward, so that the whole of the contagious disease work can be kept in one place. Six more stables and a new dead-house for the segre- gation ward have been sanctioned, and will shortly be erected. Sanction has also been given to the erection of more dog kennels, a large Anatomical room and a Hostel. These latter buildings are only awaiting the acquisition of sites by the district officers. Both are very urgently required as we shall be unable to accommodate our dissection classes if the anatomical rooms are not completed by October. The Hostel will be a great boon to students who find it yearly increasingly difficult to find accommodation, and are exposed to unhealthy surroundings in cramped rooms in the city. Segregation ward. Appendix F. 23. As has already been said, a very great improvement has been effected by providing class rooms and a laboratory in connection with the segregation ward. These were only handed over to us in December 1905, and Captain Baldrey, the Professor of Sanitary Science, has now got them equipped with necessary apparatus, &c., for teaching purposes. I cannot too strongly emphasize the great importance of making the teaching of contagious disease as practical as possible. It is these cattle plagues which really do cause enormous damage and loss to the people and to Government, and it is chiefly for the purpose of dealing with them that our Veterinary Assis- tants are required in the districts. Anything which will improve the teaching in this direction, therefore, is very welcome. I think that, when the few- buildings already sanctioned have been put up and the staff which has been sanctioned has been completed, we shall be able to do very little more to render the teaching of contagious disease more practical, and we may, I think, confidently look forward to a very considerable improvement in this direction next year. In conjunction with the teaching work a good deal of clinical diagnosis has been carried out and some investigations made as well. Work has been con- tinued on Dourine and Camel Surra. Captain Baldrey has found coccidiosis to be a common disease, and is investigating some sheep diseases such as Gillar, Juvi and Chichree-ki'bimari. I have submitted notes on Filaria and Dourine in the districts, and in conjunction with Captain Baldrey, a note on horse pox ; whilst he has issued a preliminary note on white scour and another on Chichree-ki-bimari. Appendix F. will give some idea of the scope of the investigation work done. Post Graduate's course. 24. I was consulted during the year as to the possibility of carrying out a post Graduate's course for men destined to be Veterinary Inspectors, and although cordially agreeing that all such men should have such a course of training, I was obliged to refuse as we have not sufficient room to give them any laboratory training, nor has the Professor of Sanitary Science sufficient time to devote to them at present. Demand for Veterinary Assistants. 25. The demand for Veterinary Graduates has been very great during the year. There were 91 unmet applications for men before the annual examination this year, and the greater number of them are still unmet. I am afraid that the Punjab secured but few men as the terms are not as good as in other Provinces and departments. This is, how- ever, I understand, likely to be remedied shortly, and no doubt good men will then readily take employment in the Province. As I said last year, we are making special efforts to meet the demand, and in place of the 250 promised last year, have now 278 men in training. It is hoped that this number may be gradually reduced as the demand may decline, as the classes are very large and difficult to handle, and the work entailed by imparting technical knowledge to so large a class, each individual of which needs personal treatment, is very heavy indeed. Work of the staff. 26. I am very glad to be able to report that the work done by the whole of the staff during the year under report has been, as usual, excellent. All the old teachers have always taken a pride in the College and done their best to keep up, and if possible, increase the good name which the institution has earned in the past. I am glad to find that in our new teachers also we have received a great increase of strength. Captain
6 Baldrey has worked very hard during the year, and I am pleased to notice the good work done by Ghulam Rasul Khan who came to us from Ajmere. Of course in an institution of this sort, success depends chiefly on the efficiency and energy of the teaching staff. Text-books. 27. It has been necessary during the year to issue a third edition of my Equine Medicine, and as this has been entirely rewritten and re-arranged, it has taken the translator the whole of his year's spare time. Lala Prabhu Lal has done such excellent work in this direction in the past that it is not necessary for me to repeat my opinion of him. The Indian Vernacular Veterinary Journal has been kept going, and its popularity has been well maintained. Captain Baldrey has written the English manuscript of a text-book on Sanitary Science which will be published in due course. Main results of the year's working. Table 1. 27. a. Table No. I shows the main results of the Punjab Veterinary College during the year. Part II.7 Dourine. Table II. 32. Two cases of suspected Dourine, discovered in the Gujranwala District, were reported to the Army Remount Department. It is pleasing to report that no cases have been detected in the non-selected districts. The question of legislating for this disease is under consideration. In the meantime, precautions have been taken in regard to it. Information of the nature of this disease has been widely disseminated, and rules issued for the guidance of the Veterinary staff in the event of cases being detected. Other contagious equine disease. Table II. 33. Under the head of other contagious disease, strangles causes the greatest mortality. During the year under report 14 animals died out of 199 treated, 10 deaths from tetanus in horses were also reported. (1). b. BOVINE CONTAGIOUS DISEASE. Rinderpest. Table II. 34. As mentioned above, outbreaks of Rinderpest were somewhat numerous. 22 districts were affected, and out of 8,447 animals attacked, 4,392 died, being a mortality of 51.99 per cent. The Karnal District suffered most, but serious outbreaks also occurred in the Shahpur and Jhang Districts. Preventive inoculation. Table III. 35. Preventive inoculation on a large scale was practised against this disease in actual outbreaks. Operations were carried out in 21 districts and 50,268 animals were inoculated. The large number of inoculations performed this year both for Rinderpest and Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia, viz., 57,631 against 18,440 last year for Rinderpest and Anthrax, kept the subordinate staff in many districts very busy. Veterinary Inspectors did most useful work in initiating and supervising, and Superintendents were able to check some of the work in unexpected places. Evidence is all in favour of the good results from inoculation against Rinderpest, and there seems to be no doubt that it is a most beneficial prophylactic. Opposition is now exceptional, and in some localities the method is quite popular. The results are shown in Table III. In respect of the inoculations performed against Rinderpest, 2,504 animals died uninoculated in the course of the outbreaks, and 42 after inoculation. Foot and mouth disease. Table II. 36. The year was exceptionally free from foot and mouth disease. 11,120 cases, with a mortality of 78 or 0.70 per cent. were reported against 37,290 cases in the previous year, with a mortality of 330 or 0.88 per cent. Outbreaks occurred in 13 districts, and they were attended, and the sick animals treated by the Veterinary Assistants. Hæmorrhagic Septicæ- mia. Table II. 37. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia was not as prevalent as usual. 6,148 cases were reported against 8,952 in the previous year. The mortality was 5,821 or 94.68 per cent. against 8,573 or 95.76 per cent. As usual, most of the districts were affected, 3 only escaping. The Lahore, Amritsar and Lyallpur Districts suffered the most. Preventive inoculation. Table III. 38. A preventive serum was made available for this disease during the year from the Imperial Bacteriological Laboratory, and 7,363 animals were inoculated in actual outbreaks. The method was more or less on trial, but the results appeared to be satisfactory. Some interesting results were obtained and special reports on the subject have been made to the Inspector-General, Civil Veterinary Department. The nature of this disease (vide remarks in the Annual Report for 1902-03) renders it somewhat difficult to judge of the benefits of preventive inoculation without extended trial. It may be said that it can, in any case, do no harm, if ordinary precautions are taken. 923 animals died uninoculated in the course of the outbreaks, and 9 died after inoculation. At the close of the year our indents for serum could not be entirely complied with. Black-quarter. Table II. 39. Black-quarter was reported from 12 districts. 362 cases occurred of which 347 proved fatal. In the previous year, there were 726 cases with 677 deaths. The disease was most prevalent in the Jhelum, Ferozepore and Hoshiarpur Districts. In accordance with the Government of India orders no vaccinations were performed against this disease
8 Sanction has now been received, however, to the use of Blacklegoids, and the Punjab Government have provided funds for the purchase of a sufficient quantity next year. Arrangements will be made for a regular fresh supply and a thorough investigation is being instituted for the purpose of finding out in what villages the disease regularly occurs with a view to vaccinations being performed in those places. In this way it may be possible to prevent its recurrence, and the consequent losses from it. Anthrax. Table II. 40. Anthrax was reported from nine districts. 184 deaths occurred from the disease against 268 last year. No inoculations were performed, the reports being received too late for preventive measures to be of service. Anthrax spores having been found in oil cake exported from India to Great Britain, the Secretary of State for India called for certain information on the subject. A report was accordingly submitted in which after a review of the circumstances under which it was likely to be conveyed it was stated that, without a larger staff and wider legislation, it is difficult to see what can be done to prevent it. (1). c. CONTAGIOUS DISEASE. OTHER ANIMALS. Contagious disease. Other animals. Table II. 41. The deaths recorded from contagious disease among other animals are mainly due to sheep pox and parasitic diseases in sheep and goats. For some years I have been anxious to investi- gate these diseases, but time has not permitted of it. Dur- ing the past year, material has been obtained and handed over to Captain Baldrey of the Punjab Veterinary College, who has kindly taken much interest in the work. A joint investigation in regard to a disease known as "Gillar" which is the cause of much mortality among sheep and goats, is now in progress, and results will be reported in due course. Rabies. 42. 15 cases of rabies were reported from the districts of Simla, Amritsar, Gujranwala, Gujrat, Umballa and Muzaffargarh. These cases were brought to the notice of Veterinary Assistants professionally, and bear no relation to the total number of cases that occur. (2). OTHER DISEASE. Treatment of disease in villages. Table IV. 43. During the year under report, 74 Veterinary Assistants were employ- ed on itinerating duty. They visited 8,575 villages and treated 32,052 animals. In the previous year, 12,804 vil- lages were visited, and 40,149 animals were treated. Veterinary Assistants are now required to spend more time in the larger villages, and inoculation work entails longer halts. The smaller number of animals treated during the year, compared with the previous year, is due mainly to the comparative non-preva- lence of Foot and Mouth Disease. In that year, 18,438 animals were treated for contagious disease against 9,674 animals during the year under report. 601 castrations were performed against 527 in the previous year. The work per- formed by Veterinary Assistants on tour has no doubt improved to some extent under the supervision of the Veterinary Inspectors, but it is considered that, in the absence of contagious disease, the services of the Veterinary Assis- tants are most usefully employed at Veterinary Dispensaries. This question is somewhat involved, and it is now being thoroughly discussed. (3). VETERINARY HOSPITALS AND DISPENSARIES. Veterinary Hospitals. Tables V and VI. 44. There are now 12 Veterinary Hospitals at work in the Province. Those at Gujrat, Mooltan and Murree have been opened during the year. Gujrat was opened on the 1st April. Work was commenced at Mooltan with a stationary man on the 8th January, 1906. There had been a dispensary there before with an itinerating man in 9 Buildings. 45. The new building at Ludhiana was opened during the year by the Financial Commissioner. It is built on the standard plan. The new hospital at Simla is finished, and will be ready for occupation when the fittings are complete. It is proposed to build a new hospital at Amritsar which is much required. No progress has been made in regard to a new building for Umballa. The hospitals at Delhi and Rawalpindi are in process of construction, and the one at Sargodha will be opened early next year. Proposals to provide hospitals at Karnal, Jullundur, Curdaspur, Jhang, and Jhelum are in train. Considerable improvements have been made to the hospital at Ferozepore. Were funds forthcoming the Sialkot hospital would be practically rebuilt. Veterinary dispensaries. Table V. 46. The dispensaries in charge of itinerating men continue to do useful work. This is very apparent from the number of animals treated at head-quarters. It is generally reported that the attendances would be much larger if owners could be certain of finding Veterinary Assistants in. Accommodation. 47. In many districts, there is still a good deal left to be desired in the shape of accommodation. A few new dispensaries have been provided during the year. On representations being made, a general keenness to build new dispensaries is expressed, but funds are not available for the purpose. It is hoped that my representations to Government on this point will be favourably Considered, and some assistance granted to districts for this laudable object. Equipmant. 48. Improvements in equipment continue to be made at hospitals and dispensaries. The increasing popularity and patronage of these institutions calls for more liberal treatment year by year, and I have recently had to raise the scale which was based on the absolute minimum. Equipment is provided from District Funds, and, in the majority of cases, districts have loyally acceded to my estimates. Income and expenditure at Veterinary Hospitals. Table VI. 49. The income and expenditure at Veterinary Hospitals are shown in Table VI from information received from districts. Al- though, with the exception of Murree and Simla, charges are only made in the case of income-tax payers, it will be seen that at some of the institutions no inconsiderable income is obtained. A total income of Rs 15,977-1-10 was realised in 12 Veterinary Hospitals against Rs. 11,366 for 9 the year before. I regard the increase as an index of the popularity of these institutions. Part III10 Local purchases. 52. In a few cases, districts continue to purchase bulls in the open market with the advice of this Department, but good bulls are difficult to obtain in this way. Sargodha Ball Farm. 53. A revised scheme for a Bull Farm near Sargodha was submitted, and it- met with the general approval of the Punjab Govenment. An initial outlay of Rs. 1,29,809 is contemplated. On the recommendation of the Inspector-General, Civil Veterinary Department, who, with the Director of Land Records and Agriculture, and the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, visited the Colony last November, the rights of grazing on the Drema Bakh near Sargedba have been applied for. It is hoped that a commanded site in the vicinity of the rakh can be obtained for a Home Farm, The site originally allotted for the Bull Farm is too far from the rakh. This question of site is causing some delay in commencing operations. It is contemplated to issue 50 bulls a year from this Bull Farm, suitable to the northern districts of the Punjab, and they will no doubt supply a great and pressing need. (2). EQUINES (UNDER LOCAL BODIES). Replacement of stallions. 54. Reference was made last year to a scheme, which then awaited the sanction of the Government of India for assisting districts in the purchase of stallions, the number of which was inadequate. The scheme was approved, and the initial outlay involved, viz., Rs. 36,600, was shared equally between the Imperial and Local Governments. With this sum of money it was proposed to purchase 20 horses and 16 donkeys. The standard scale referred to last year was finally fixed at 62 horses (3 horses and 59 ponies) and 68 donkeys. Of this number, 20 horses and all the donkeys are replaceable by Government. District Boards are responsible for the up-keep- of all stallions. The required number of horses (all Arabs) were purchased in Bombay through the Inspector-General, Civil Veterinary Department, and despatched to Lahore in three lots. They were there tested with mallein, and allotted and despatched to the districts concerned. In addition to the 20 horses supplied by Government, the districts of Rohtak, Sialkot, Gurdaspur, Muzaffargarh, Jullundur and Hoshirpur each bought a stallion to replace casualties for which they were responsible. In each case these animals were either bought through. or with the approval of, the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department. The districts of Ludhiana, Kangra and Gurgaon are each one stallion (replaceable from District Funds) short of the standard scale. They were unable to purchase the horses for financial reasons which have been accupied by the Director of Agriculture on the understanding that they will be provined next year. Number of horse and pony stallions in non-select- ed districts. Table X. 55. At the close of the year, there were 5 horses and 55 ponies present in the non-selected districts against 2 horses and 36 ponies the previous year. This is two short of the standard scale. As referred to above, Ludhiana Kangra, and Gurgaon are each one short, and Jullundur is one animal over strength. There- were four casualties during the year. Services of borse and pony stallions. Table XI. 56. Five horses and 36 ponies were actually employed at stud during the year under report. It should be mentioned that 3 of the newly purchased horses are included in these numbers, though they only served a few mares at the end of the year. Most of the ponies were received later, and they were not used in the year under report. With the. approval of the Inspector-General, Civil Veterinary Department, I have advised districts to limit the services of the newly- imported stallions to half the usual number of mares for their first year. The average number of mares covered was 74.5 per horse, and 66.72 per pony against 64 and 68.52, respectively, last year. Training of syces. 57. Through the kindness of Captain Farmer, Superintendent, Gov- ernment Cattle Farm, Hissar, 12 syces from the districts of Hissar, Rohtak and Mianwali were sent there for a month's training.
11 Fsed and keep of horse and pony stations. Table XII. 58. The average cost of feed and keep of horse and pony stallions is shown in Table XII. The figures are Rs. 273-9-9 per horse, and Rs. 226-12-2 per pony, against Rs. 249-8-0 and Rs. 239-8-11, respectively, in 1904-05. Donkey stallions non- selected districts. Table X. 59. There were five casualties among the donkey stallions in the non- selected districts during the year, and four animals were purchased from Hissar. This left a balance of 54 against 55 the previous year. The standard scale is 68, and Government have taken the responsibility of supplying this number and replacing casualties. An indent for 16 donkeys was submitted to the Inspector- Ganeral Civil Veterinary Department, but only four were available. These were supplied to the Montgomery, Karnal, Sialkot and Hoshiarpur Districts. The scarcity of suitable donkey stallions is a serious matter, and its effect on mule breeding is bound to be felt shortly. A separate representation has been made on this subject. Not only are we short of the standard scale by 13 animals, but many of those at present at work are old and of doubtful utility. A large number of them should be replaced within the next few years, if possible. Services of donkey stal- lions. Table XI. 60. During the year, 50 donkey stallions were employed at stud in non-selected districts. They covered 3,409 mares, or an average of 68.18 per cent. each against 71.12 last year. Feed and keep of donkey stallions. Table XII. 6l. The average cost of feed and keep of donkey stallions is shown in Table XII. It amounted to an average of Rs. 152-3-7. per head. These charges are borne by District Boards from whom the figures have been obtained. Collection of statistics. 62. A register of coverings for stallions has always been kept up at stallion stands, but since Government horse breeding was transferred to the Army Remount Department, producs results have not been collected. During the year, the Inspector-General, Civil Veterinary Department, pointed out the desirability of produce results being obtaired, and asked that a method might be drawn up which would give the minimum amount of trouble to all concerned. A system has been defined and promulgated to districts. With the assistance of the veterinary staff, they will now be able to supply results of coverings. It seems desirable, therefore, to prescribe a table in this Report for these figures in future. (3). FAIRS AND SHOWS. Fairs and Shows .Tables XIII and XIV. 63. Certain information regarding the source and amount of prize money and the number of animals present at Fairs and Shows is given in Tables XIII and XIV. In regard to Horse Shows those held in non-selected districts only are included. Horse Shows. 64. At the Delhi and Umballa Horse Shows Rs. 450 and Rs. 600 from Imperial Funds were given respectively. Prize money for horses was given from District Funds at Jullundur, Muzaffargarh, Gulu Shah and Ludhiana. An Officer of this Department attended each Show, and Separate reports were submitted. The Karnal Horse Show was abandoned on account of the carcity of fodder. Cattle Shows. 65. Officers of this Department attended as members of the Judging Committee at the following Cattle Shows :12 Jullundur, no medals were given as the animals brought forward were not con- sidered up to the standard. It is early to say if the giving of these medals will act as an encouragement. The experiment will probably be proceeded with for some years. When medals are given the presence of a Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, at each Show is necessitated, which is sometimes incon- venient. A grant of money (Rs. 250) was given to the Sargodha Cattle Show from Provincial Funds to start it, and it was supplemented from local resources The utility of Shows. 68. As stated by me last year, there is not much evidence to show that the mere giving of prize money tends to improve indigenous stock. It is no doubt desirable, however, to continue giving prizes for some years in selected places, so that a thorough trial may be made. In discussing this question, it is necessary to recognise a distinct difference between a Cattle Show and a Cattle Fair. The first depends on prize money for its existence, but the latter is independent of such artificial help. Once a Cattle Show becomes a Cattle Fair, the giving of prize money is not necessary. I referred last year to the great value of Cattle Fairs, as place where dealers resort, and where considerable buying and selling takes place. The fact that such Fairs exist is proof of their economic value, and they have an effect on cattle breeding generally though not necessarily in their im- mediate neighbourhood. The experience gained so far points to the giving of prize money at Shows in localities, where a good indigenous breed exists, in order that competition amongst the actual breeders of the neighbourhood may result. Part IV.13 of raising the pay of the Veterinary Assistants in this Department is very apparent, and I consider that such a measure is justified for many reasons. The matter has already been represented to Government, and it is understood that it is being favourably considered. Training in inoculation. 73. During the year 16 men were sent to Muktesar or Bareilly for training in inoculation work. Part V APPENDIX Aii APPENDIX Biii APPENDIX D-(See paragraph 20).

Proceedings of His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab in the Department of Revenue and Agriculture (General), No. 1913 S., dated 24th August 1907, READ2 and Montgomery, and carried off almost 8,000 animals in the province as com- pared with 4,000 last year. There was also a large rise in the deaths from hæmorrhagic septicæmia, and black-quarter destroyed over 1,100 animals. A vigorous campaign of preventive inoculation, attended by a considerable measure of success, was carried on against the three diseases last mentioned, the number of animals so treated rising from fifty-seven to one hundred and ten thousand. The Lieutenant-Governor is glad to see that the agricultural population is beginning to appreciate the value of scientific treatment, and thinks that the increased confidence in the department reported by Captain Walker is most creditable both to his supervision and to the tact and good work of his subordi- nate staff. 9 There has been an increase of five in the number of hospitals at work, and the total number is now seventeen. It is satisfactory to observe that the Chief Superintendent anticipates that in a few years the province will be amply provided with properly equipped dispensaries. The number of animals treated by the Department has increased by 40 per cent. during the year under review. 10. The breeding operations call for no remark beyond the statement of the fact that the supply of donkey stallions still remains considerably below the requirements of the Province. 11. Sir Denzil Ibbetson considers that the progress of the Department has been well maintained during the year under review, and wishes to record his appreciation of the excellent work done by Captain Walker. He also desires now that Major Pease has finally left the Lahore Veterinary College, to express his high appreciation of the admirable work done by Major Pease during his long connection with that institution, and of the high standard of efficiency to which he assisted by an admirable staff, both European and Indian, succeeded in raising it. ORDER.No. FROM L. FRENCH, ESQUIRE, C. S., Officiating Director of Agriculture, Punjab, To THE HON'BLE MR. E. D. MACLAGAN, C.S., Chief Secretary to Government, Punjab. Dated the July 1907. SIR, I have the honour to submit the annual combined Report on the Punjab Veterinary College and the Provincial Civil Veterinary Department for the year 1906-07. 2. Following the precedent of last year the Principal of the College has written Part I and the Chief Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Parts II to IV. The Preface and Parts V and VI embody my remarks. In accord- ance with the suggestions made by His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor in the review of last year's Report, all the Appendices have been eliminated, their salient features being incorporated in the text of the Report. It has, however, been thought advisable to exclude the figures of the old Appendix C from Table V (which refers entirely to hospitals and dispensaries under the Chief Superin- tendent, Civil Veterinary Department), and to discuss them in the Principal's Report. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, L. FRENCH, Officiating Director of Agriculture, Punjab
ANNUAL REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY ADMINISTRATION IN THE PUNJAB. FOR THE YEAR 1906-07. PREFACE. A.2 College. There is also the question of expense. Perhaps, the appointment of a Eurasian farrier would be the best solution of the difficulty, if a really efficient one can be found. Inquiries on this point are being pursued. B.3 Shows, inspected two tonga lines and visited Sargodha twice in connection with the Bull-Farm project and Hissar once for selection of stud-bulls. He was also appointed a member of the College Board of Examiners. Mr. Woodley was on tour 117 days (78 in the Punjab), during which he covered 6,078 miles by rail and 1,047 miles by road. He attended outbreaks of disease and made inspections in 16 districts. He judged at three Horse and Cattle Shows and inspected four tonga lines. Mr. Gaiger was also attached to the Province for training in the expect- ation that he would be appointed Superintendent, South Punjab, but was trans- ferred to the Punjab Veterinary College to fill the place of Captain Baldrey. During his training he was on tour for 45 days, travelling 1,586 miles by rail and 220 miles by road. Unfortunately, none of the above officers were able to spend any appreci- able time under canvas owing to the immense distances to be traversed. Notice oers. 11. The greatest credit is due to Captain Walker for his energetic and capable management of the Department. His advice has always been of the greatest assistance. An acknowledg- ment is also due to Mr. Woodley for his close application to his duties. Part I.4 to their failure to attend the required number of lectures the number of exami- nees for 1st year's examination was reduced to 107. Educational qualifications. The educational qualifications of the 118 men, ad- mitted during the year, were as follows:5 amount of time, and even then it was impossible to finish in less than 16 days. Had it not been feasible to examine several students together in some of the subjects the period occupied by the examinations would necessarily have been longer." To their suggestion that the first and second year students should be ex- amined by the Professors of the College, I see but slight objection, and consider it to be the best solution of the difficulty. Transport dressers' class. 21. In addition to the ordinary classes 45 men from the Transport De- partment received three months' training as dressers. Nalbands. 22. During the year 15 men received a nine months course of instruc- tion in shoeing. At the examination, held in January 1907, of this number, 14 were successful and obtained a certificate of proficiency as farriers. Caste of students. 23. The students in the College at the close of the year comprised6 mouth disease was again very prevalent, and accounts mainly for the large increase in the number of cases. Rinderpest was very generally reported, and very few districts escaped the ravages of this disease. As stated last year, the increasing efficiency and expansion of the department tends to disease being reported that otherwise would have escaped notice. A new system for collecting statistics of disease was submitted to Government during the year and was approved. Final orders as to details which concern the revenue administration are required from the Financail Commissioner before the system is adopted and these are awaited. I am glad to be able to testify that increased confidence among agriculturists in the work of this Department in connection with the treatment of contagious dis- ease is being continually brought to my notice, and outbreaks of disease are now spontaneously reported and assistance requested more frequently than in the past. Investigation of disease. 32. With the limited staff capable of original investigation it has been impossible to do much in this way, but something has been done and will be reported separately in due course. This report is strictly limited in length, and space does not permit of anything but a superficial outline of the year's work being recorded. The subordinate staff have been specially instructed how to send in specimens for examination, and this part of their work is encouraged. During the year 42 specimens were sent to the Lahore office for examination, and 17 of these were examined by me and results recorded. The remaining specimens were sent to the Punjab Veterinary College. When I am absent on tour all specimens received at head-quarters are sent to the Punjab Veterinary College for examination, and the results are kindly communicated by the Principal Any other specimens of special interest are also invariably sent for examination and information. As a matter of fact Superin- tendents, even if they had workable charges, have not much opportunity for Laboratory work and consequently the co-operation of the officers at the Punjab Veterinary College Laboratory is much appreciated. 1 (a). Equine Contagious disease. Revised rules for dealing with glanders, Surra and lymphangitis epizootica. 33. During the year revised rules for dealing with glanders, surra and lymphangitis epizootica were approved and notified. A revised list of officers in the Province having powers of Veterinary Practitioners or Inspectors under the Act was also notified. Glanders.7 Preventive noculation.8 men treated and castrated 32,653 cases in 8,575 villages. The increase of cases treated is mainly attributable to the greater prevalence of Foot-and- mouth disease during the year under report. A smaller number of villages was visited, as inoculations took up a good deal of time of many of the men and necessitated longer halts in villages. Inoculated animals are not included in the number of animals treated. It has been definitely decided that itinerating work in the ordinary sense will be performed in future by one man only in each District. The other men will remain in stationary charge of their respective Dispensaries unless epidemic disease breaks out in their circles. The system of reporting contagious disease not yet having been finally settled the new system is not likely to come into force for some months. (3).9 Part III10 Services of stallions. Table XI. 60. Five horses and 55 ponies were actually employed at stud work during the year. The average number of mares covered was 42 per horse and 46 per pony. 52 donkey stallions covered an average of 51 mares each. As mentioned last year the services of the newly purchased animals were limited in some cases, and this has brought down the average somewhat. Food and keep of stal- lions. Table XII. 61. The average cost of the feed and keep of stallions for the year under report was as follows:11 This is an increase of 6 Veterinary Inspectors and 9 Veterinary Assistants on the previous year. 4 Veterinary Assistants were added to the cadre in accordance with the scheme to increase the establishment by that number annually, 4 were sanctioned to take charge of the new Hospitals at Jhelum, Jullundur, Gurdaspur and Karnal, and one for the newly established office of the Superin- tendent, Civil Veterinary Department, North Punjab. At the end of the year under report there were 9 vacancies owing to the lack of suitable candidates but, since then, sanction has been received to the increase of the pay of the Veterinary Assistants to Rs. 30, Rs. 40 and Rs. 50 for the three grades, respectively and all vacancies have been filled by suitable men. Increase to staff sanction- ed. 67. It has been decided to add 8 men a year to the cadre in future and to provide a 5 per cent. reserve for leave vacancies and training. Work performed. 68. The increase of the establishment of Veterinary Inspectors has allowed of their charges being made much smaller and their Divisions now consist of 3 or 4 Districts each. The reduction of the areas, of which these men hold charge, has contributed to the efficiency of the Department considerably. The work of the Veterinary Assistants has been referred to above and much of the success of the year's working is due to the supervision of the Veterinary Inspectors who have in most cases worked intelligently and keenly. Both Veterinary Inspectors and Assistants appear to be taking interest in their work and I think the subordinate staff is rapidly gaining efficiency all round. Future requirements. 69. The need for more Veterinary Assistants is being continually brought to my notice by District Officers and others, but the system of adding a number of men to the cadre every year will in course of time fill up the present gaps and Districts must exercise patience. At the present rate they will get their full complement of one man per Tahsil and one in addition per District in the course of a few years. I antici- pate, however, that it will be found necessary at no very distant date to place at least 2 Veterinary Assistants in each Tahsil. Training in inoculation. 70. During the year 12 men were sent to Muktsar or Bareilly for training in inoculation work. Part V.TABLE No. I.ii TABLE II.-(See paragraphs 31-39, 41, 43, 44, 47 and 48.)

SECTION 1 (c).Proceedings of His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab in the Department of Revenue and Agriculture (General),ANNUAL REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY ADMINISTRATION IN THE PUNJAB FOR THE YEAR 1907-08. PREFACE. GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. The Punjab Veterinary College. 1. Captain Smith acted as Principal of the Punjab Veterinary College throughout the year, being confirmed on September 4th, 1907, on the appointment of Colonel Pease as Inspector- General of the Civil Veterinary Department. Captain Dawson, Captain Holmes and Mr. Gaiger held the other two Professorships at various times, there being however short periods during which the staff was short by one English officer. Khan Bahadur Doctor Amir Shah, Professor of Chemistry, retired on March 1st, 1908, on attaining the age of 60. He had been attached to the College almost since its commencement, and he had done exceptionally good service, being held in great respect by his colleagues and the students. Civil Veterinary Depart- ment. 2. Captain G. K. Walker held the appointment of Chief Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Punjab, throughout the year, and also acted as Superintendent of the South Punjab Circle, there being no officer available for that charge. Mr. V. De V. H. Woodley was in charge of the North Punjab Circle as well as of the North-West Frontier Province. Messrs. Taylor and Carless joined the Department on the 24th June, 1907, and 24th November, 1907, respectively, for training. Mr. Taylor was kept mainly in the South Punjab, with a view to his ultimately taking over that Circle. Extent and duration of tours of officers. 3. Captain Walker was 141 days on tour, travelling 9,150 miles by rail and 1,155 miles by road and visiting the districts of Gurdaspur, Amritsar, Shahpur, Kangra, Delhi, Simla, Sialkot, Multan, Ambala, Hissar, Ferozepore, Lyallpur, Hoshiarpur and Rawal- pindi. Extended tours and collections of animals were made in Jullundur, Hoshiarpur, Hissar and Multan. In the course of his tours, Captain Walker inspected 27 Veterinary Hospitals, and judged at 7 horse and cattle shows. He was a member of the Board of Examiners at the Punjab Veterinary College in April, 1907, and assisted in the examination of the 'nalband' class in January. He also attended the Veterinary Conference at Calcutta in February, and acted as Secretary. The Kalka-Simla, Pathankot-Dunera, and Kangra tonga lines were inspected on one or more occasions. Mr. Woodley was on tour 83 days in the Punjab, covering 5,438 miles by rail and 919 miles by road. He judged at 4 cattle fairs and shows, inspected all the tonga lines in his Circle, and checked the work done at 14 Veterinary Hospitals. Brood mares, young stock, bulls and stallions were inspected at convenient centres. Mr. Woodley attended the Veterinary Conference at Calcutta, and also a lecture on biting flies given by the Assistant to the Imperial Entomologist at Lahore. Captain Walker and Mr. Woodley both made a special point of meeting District Officers and discussing veterinary matters with them.
2 Mr. Taylor was 117 days on tour during which time he travelled 6,294 miles by rail and 931 miles by road, and obtained a thorough knowledge of the South Punjab Circle. He judged at 5 horse and cattle shows and acted as a member of the Board of Examiners of the 'nalband' class at the Punjab Veteri- nary College. Mr. Carless was 57 days on tour, and travelled 1,594 miles by rail and 387 miles by road. He judged at two horse and cattle shows. It was not possible for the Superintendents to spend more than a few days under canvas owing to the shortage of officers and the heavy work in connection with the starting of the modified itinerating system for veterinary assistants. Introduction of the new system of working for veterinary assistants. 4. The feature of the year's administration has been the introduction of the new system of working for veterinary assistants. In place of itinerating men in tahsils and a stationary man at district headquarters, we now have one itinerating assistant per district and "stationary" men at tahsils. The "stationary" men, however, have to leave their hospitals to attend all outbreaks of contagious disease. The change has entailed the revision of departmental forms and registers and the issue of new rules and circulars for the guidance of the subordinate staff. District cattle surveys. 5. Owing to pressure of other work, nothing was done in the direction of district cattle surveys. But a beginning will be made in the next camping season. The Chief Superintendent proposes to take the Amritsar district first, the Superintendent, South Punjab, has selected the Hissar district, and the Superintendent, North Punjab, the Jhelum district Instructions have been issued to the Divisional Inspectors to carry out a prelimi- nary survey in those districts and the Deputy Commissioners concerned have been requested to order revenue officials to render the Inspectors every assistance District programmes of veterinary improvements. 6. Scarcity has interfered to some extent with the carrying out of the programmes of veterinary improvements framed for the utilisation of the grant of one lakh of rupees to District Boards for five years. Still good progress has been made, a large number of bulls have been purchased, the equipment of veterinary hospitals has been greatly improved, and the grant should be sufficient to provide good hospitals in most tahsils. Miscellaneous matters. 7. The schedules of fees chargeable at the veterinary hospitals at Delhi Simla, Amritsar, and Lyallpur were revised to suit local conditions. Revised and amplified standard plans of veteri- nary hospitals, and standard plans of stallion stables were printed and issued for the guidance of District Boards. Agricultural Circulars 4 and 5 were entirely recast, and all forms and returns in use in the Civil Veterinary Department were standardised. Issue of rules for the regulation of tonga traffic on the Rawalpindi-Kashmir road. 8. Rules have been prescribed in Punjab Gazette Notification No. 674 (Home-General), dated the 1st May, 1907, for the regulation of the tonga traffic on the Rawalpindi-Kashmir road. These measures have been necessitated by the persistent overload- ing of tongas and overworking of tonga ponies in past years. The appointment of a European non-commissioned officer as tonga inspec- tor at Kohala has also been sanctioned by Government. Part I.3 Veterinary graduates course. 10. During the year, there have been three classes undergoing instruc- tion for the three years' course composed as follows:4 the College. One civil student failed all round so badly that his name has been struck off, and two scholarship-holders from the Central Provinces did very badly. The Central Provinces Government have now stopped their scholarships but these two, with three others, are allowed to continue their studies for another year. Of the 21 failures, in the second year class, 15 were in one subject only, and will be re-examined in that subject, at the end of June. Of the 6 remaining failures in this class, only 4 are continuing their studies for another year as 2 have since left the College. Of the 20 failures in the final year class, 4 will be re- examined in the one subject in which they failed at the end of June. Two mili- tary men, on my advice, have been removed by their Regiments and the remain- ing 14, together with any who may fail to satisfy the examiner in June, are remanded for another year. Report of the Board of Examiners. 19. The Board of Examiners report that "considering the unwieldly size of the classes the results may be considered satisfactory". The transport dressers' class. 20. In addition to the ordinary classes held during the year, a class of 65 men from the Transport Department received three months' training as Dressers. Nalbands. 21. Nine men received a nine months' course of instruction in shoeing. At the examination held in January, 1908, all these men passed successfully. Caste of students. 22. The students in the College at the close of the year comprised:5 Working of the dog hospital. 26. The income actually realised from the Dog Hospital in 1907-08 amounted to Rs. 1,052 against an expenditure of Rs. 1,118. But there are a certain number of bad debts and of out- standing items and if these were collected the income and expenditure would about balance. The segregation ward. 27. Work in the segregation ward may be divided as follows:6 Foundation of a "Pease" scholarship. 31. The popularity of the late Principal, Colonel H. T. Pease, C.I. E., was very practically demonstrated by post graduates and the native staff of the college founding a scholarship of Rs. 10 per mensem to be called the "Pease scholarship". The sum of Rs. 2,500 was subscribed and vested in the name of the Principal. At the suggestion of the founders of the scholarship, it is to be given to the student who passes first in the subject taken by the Board of Examiners at the second year class examination and is tenable for one year. Part II.7 a good collection of the biting flies in the Punjab can be made. Recent investi- gations have shown that the importance of the part played by the biting flies of this country in spreading many of the more fatal epidemic diseases of animals cannot be overestimated. It is, therefore, expedient that the services of the subordinate staff of this Department should be utilised in acquiring an accurate knowledge of their prevalence and distribution in the Province. SECTION 1 (a).8 practical way. There is little doubt that it would be beard of less if more attention were paid to keeping cattle under hygienic conditions. Foot and mouth disease. Table II. 45. Foot and mouth disease occurred in 20 districts. Of 38,683 cases reported, 673 died, against 74,944 cases and 311 deaths last year. Blackquarter. Table II. 46. Blackquarter was reported from 19 districts with 678 cases and 632 deaths. Jhelum and Montgomery suffered the most. Last year's figures for the Province were 1,188 cases and 1,119 deaths. Preventive Vaccinations. Table III. 47. 1,655 vaccinations were performed in 33 villages with the reagent imported from America. The results in all cases were found to be satisfactory so far as can be ascertained at present. Vaccinations will continue to be performed in infected places and results will be closely watched. Anthrax. Table II. 48. Outbreaks of anthrax were reported from 13 districts and 240 deaths were recorded. SECTION 1 (c).9 additions and alterations to buildings and the salary of the veterinary assistant. The excess of receipts over expenditure is to be credited to Government, and the fees are to be so adjusted that the surplus will cover the salary of the veterinary assistant and interest on the outlay on buildings. The Civil Veterinary Depart- ment will continue to supervise the institution as before and to make appointments to the staff. The accounts for the year show a total income of Rs. 3,140, against an expenditure of Rs. 1,834, so that Rs. 1,306 have been credited to Government. This is Rs. 248 less than the sum required to cover the salary of the veterinary assistant and the interest on the capital cost of the buildings. But outstandings amounted to the large sum of Rs, 1,635, and the deficit will doubtless be made good this year. Part III.10 Feed and keep of stal- lions. Table XII. 61. The average cost of feed and keep of stallions for the year trader report was Rs. 305 per horse, Rs. 312 per pony and Rs. 158 per donkey. This information has, as usual, been obtained from the districts concerned. Collection of statistics. 62. The present system of collecting horse-breeding statistics referred to in last year's report is working fairly well except that breeders in most cases do not return the required informa- tion. A description of this system is given in Agricultural Circular No. 6. SECTION 3.11 Training in inoculation. 70. During the year, 16 veterinary assistants were sent to Muktsar or Bareilly (U. P.) for training in inocula- tion work. Part V.12 The attention of the Simla Municipal Committee has been drawn to the large outstandings at the close of the year, and steps are being taken for their realisation. The realisable outstandings will more than make good the small deficit on the year's working. The district scales of horse and donkey stallions are almost complete, and it is hoped that all deficiencies will be supplied in the current year. The situ- ation as regards donkey stallions has improved greatly with the arrival of 24 from Europe. As above. 75. With two circles in his direct care, the supervision of the entire Department and the training of two newly joined officers, in addition to the introduction of a new system of working, Captain Walker has had a very arduous year. I cannot speak too highly of the thoroughness of his work and of the administrative ability which he has dis- played. I would notice particularly the good relations which Captain Walker has established between the Department and Local Bodies. Mr. Woodley has shown great interest in his charge and is a promising officer. Mr. Taylor has been very quick in acquiring a knowledge of the details of his duties, and both he and Mr. Carless were able to render useful assistance. W. RENOUF, C. S., July 30th, 1908.
