( 9 ) No. 1053 A. PROCEEDINGS OF THE HON'BLE THE LIEUTENANT-GOVER- NOR, PUNJAB, IN THE GENERAL DEPARTMENT. DATED 11TH APRIL, 1868. READ Annual Report on Vaccine Operations in the Punjab, for the year 1867, furnished by Dr. A. M. Garden, Superintendent-General of Vaccination. REMARKS. * Year. By Vaccine Establishment. At Dispensaries. 1866 ... 1,62,100 85,994 1867 ... 1,34,820 61,746 1. The returns for 1867 show a falling off in the number of persons vaccinated, both in the case of vaccinations performed by the special establishment and those performed at Dispensaries.* In the former case the falling off is said to result from the difficulty of supervising operations in the Rawulpindi district, on account of its large size and the sparseness of its population; but no explanation is given of the falling off in the numbers vaccinated by dispensary establishments, though in some districts the falling off is very considerable, as will be seen from the subjoined statement :( 10 ) 4. With reference to the complaint of the people of the Jullundhur district, that children already vaccinated are taken from one village to another to supply vaccine. His Honor desires that in future no children be so taken without the consent of their parents. The practice may appear to the Super- intendent-General to involve no great hardship, but it is certainly unlawful, and if continued will do much to render vaccination unpopular. 5. The alleged apathy in the matter of vaccination exhibited by the Tahsildars of the Ludianah district has attracted His Honor's attention ; but the remark of the Superintendent-General that &quot;vaccination has never succeed- ed&quot; in the district seems inconsistent with the Superintendent-General's Re- turn of 1866, wherein it is stated that in the Ludianah district 5,310 persons were vaccinated, and 4,890 successfully,V.

From A. M. GARDEN, ESQ., Superintendent General of Vaccination, Punjab, to the Secretary to Government, Punjab. SIR, I have the honor to submit, for the information of His Honor the Lieute- nant Governor, my Report on Vaccine Operations in the Punjab for the year 1868. Cost of Punjab Vaccine Es- tablishment. Cost of Dispensary Establish- ments. The numbers Vaccinated during the year by the Punjab Vaccine Estab- lishment are 1,68,970, being an increase of 34,150, upon the work of the pre- ceding year. The number of successful cases is, 159,704. The numbers vaccinated by the Dispensary Establishments are 64,892, being an increase of 3.146 upon the work of the preceding year; the number of successful cases is 44,177, and the cost of the Punjab Vaccine Establishment during the year is Rs. 40,266 ; each successful case, therefore, costs annas 4 and a small fraction. The cost of the Dispensary Establishment is 5,903 Rupees; each successful case, therefore, costs annas 2 and 1 pie and a fraction. The total number of cases Vaccinated by the Punjab Vaccine Establish- ment and Dispensary Vaccinators, is 233,862, and the cost of each successful case is annas 2 and 7 pie and a fraction. Operations concluded in the Rawul Pindee district. 2. Operations were concluded in the Rawul Pindee district on the 20th of January, and the success met with, as shewn in the Report for last year, was very good. Sealkote( 2 ) part of their regular duties. If they will do this, a great object will be gained. As early as possible in November, operations were renewed in the district, and by the middle of December the whole of it had been visited. Precautions to prevent the spreading of Small Pox.Strict quarantine regulations advised. 4. Whilst at work here, I had several opportunities of noticing how com- paratively easy it is to check Small Pox from becoming epidemic in the villages of a district( 3 ) effective, but I fear greatly that the disease has spread so far as to be now beyond checking, except by very vigorous measures. The Deputy Commis- missioner was at this time absent in the district, and on the circumstances being- brought to his notice, he at once sent particular instructions to the Committee for their guidance. Loodiana. 7. In the Loodiana district much more work has been done, than during last year. Radha Kishn, Tehseeldar of Jugraon, gave good assistance to the vaccinators, and from what I have learnt, the other Tehseeldars are prepared to give help when their Tehseels are visited. Chumba. Pangi. 8. In the hot weather I went to Chumba, having been requested by the Rajah and Superintendent to vaccinate the people of that state. The greater part of it had been visited by me on a former occasion. No difficulty was now met with, and operations proceeded most favorably. As Pangi, a part of the Chumba territory situated on the further side of the snowy range, a very wild and isolated region, had not been visited before, I took a few vaccinators there. No opposition was met with and the people were vaccinated as far up as &quot;Trilognath&quot; and the villages border- ing Lahoul. All the Hill States, Cis and. Trans Sutlej, have been visited. 9. Now that the people of Pangi have been vaccinated, all the hill states, including Spiti and Lahoul, have been in turn visited since I have held this appointment; and I believe, that with two exceptions, namely Spiti and Keuntal, vaccinators are welcomed in all. The people of Spiti object to it as their communications beyond the border are cut off during and for some time after the performance of the operations : when I was there in May 1863, I vaccinated about 1,800 of the people. The present Rajah of Keuntal has alway been opposed to vaccination. Inoculation rarely practised in these hills. 10. Inoculation for Small Pox, formerly the rule, is now very rarely prac- tised in the hill states, Cis and Trans Sutlej, there be- ing only two or three chiefs who rather, I think from old custom than any other cause, prefer it to vaccination. I believe it may be safely stated that vaccination is more generally preferred in these parts; I am led to this conclusion by the frequent invitations I receive from the chiefs to visit their territories. Part of the Establishment sent to do duty at the dispen- saries in the plains during the hot months. At Dalhousie, vaccinators em- ployed as Sanitary Inspectors. 11. As there was not sufficient work for the whole establishment in the hills, a part of it was sent to several districts in the plains, where they were employed under the orders of the Civil Surgeons at the Sudder and Branch Dispensa- ries. Their services were also to be made use of in the case of epidemics appearing in the districts. Dr. Birch, Civil Surgeon of Dalhousie, employed those placed under his orders, as Sanitary Inspectors : they reported to him upon the state of the station, the water courses, and the condition of the Bazaar, and he states that &quot;the measure was a success, and certainly contributed towards the cleanliness of the station.&quot; Remarks on Inoculation of Small Pox. 12. With regard to the subject of &quot;Inoculation of Small Pox.&quot;( 4 ) whether this practice should or should not be entirely forbidden in India. I believe that all are agreed that when vaccination can be substituted for it, it should be forbidden, but not otherwise, but on the contrary, it should be allow- ed. This being a matter of great importance, I trust I may be allowed to insert in this report some statistics concerning it, especially as there are some districts in the Punjab (Hazara, Peshawur, Goojrat, Wazeerabad &c.,) where the oper- ation is performed every year. My own opinion is that it should be entirely forbidden, as I believe it tends not only to keep up the disease, but is also some- times the cause of its becoming epidemic. From statistics published in England (Parliamentary Return 26th April 1853, and Registrar General's Returns) it appears that in London the mean an- nual Small Pox deaths per 1000 deaths were :( 5 ) petitions from the merchants begging him not to vaccinate there. I requested him to frequently talk to them about it, and if possible get them to consent to its being done. Dr. Caylcy's success in Ladak. Dr. Cayley has informed the Government of the success he ultimately met with, which was very great. Rajah of &quot;Mundi&quot; entertains vaccinators. The Rajah of &quot;Mundi&quot; has entertained two vac- cinators for work in his territory. &quot;Inoculation&quot; of heifers 15. On several occasions I wished to inoculate heifers with Small Pox matter, the Hindus, however, always objected to its being done and I did not attempt to press it on them. Dr.s Bellew and Johnson of Peshawur and Murdan, found that the people of those parts did not in the least object to it, and they performed many operations, but unfortunately without success. My object was to see if the vaccine matter so obtained was superior to that received from England, and if so to renew it from time to time in the same manner as that now done in several countries of Europe. No supplies of vaccine receiv- ed from England. 16. No vaccine was received from England this year. It is a safe pre- caution for some to be suppied yearly, and I beg that an application for an annual supply may be made. The latter part of September is the best time for it to reach the Punjab. VACCINATION AT DISPENSARIES. The number of vaccinations performed in some districts is considerably larger than those of the previous year, on the other hand there is a marked falling off in several districts. The total of the operations performed is 64,892. The per-centage of successful cases is 72.96. BUNNU.( 6 ) GOOJRANWALLA.( 7 ) &quot;Usud Ali&quot; Naib Tehseeldar of Sealkote, &quot;Joahir Lall&quot; Tehseeldar of Pusroor in the Sealkote district, and &quot;Radha Kishn&quot; Tehseeldar of Jugroan in the Loodiana district, all of these by their examples and exertions gave excel- lent assistance to the vaccinators. Dr. Ross, Civil Surgeon of Bunnu, and Dr. Courtney, Civil Surgeon of Dera Ismael Khan, have always taken great interest in vaccination. Dr. Ross praised highly the services of vaccinator &quot;Gholam Mahoideen,&quot; and I trust that a reward may be given to him. Appended to this report are Returns shewing the numbers vaccinated during the year. A. M. GARDEN, Superintendent General of Vaccination. Punjab.

No. 791. Proceedings of the Honorable the Lieutenanl Governor of the Punjab in the General Department, dated the 10th March 1869. Read annual Report on Vaccine operations in the Punjab for the year 1868 furnished by Dr. A. M. Garden, Superintendent General of Vaccination. The following Statement shews the number of persons Vaccinated by the special establishment and by the establishments at Dispensaries for the last 3 years. Year. By Special Establishment.

The enforcement of strict quarantine regulations in the case of villages infected with small pox advocated in paragraph 4 of the report, would, His Honor apprehends, be a matter of difficulty and give rise to much vexatious oppression; but it is desirable that District Officers, on learning of the outbreak of small pox in a village, should warn the headmen of adjacent villages to prevent as far as possible all intercourse with the infected village, and this they will be instructed to do. His Honor will be glad to learn in detail the arrange- ments made by Lieutenant Colonel Mercer for preventing the spread of the disease in the villages of Syalkot. The fact that some of his Hakims have themselves undertaken to vaccinate, affords an additional evidence of the prac- tical value of the system which he has inuagurated. An Indent for fresh vaccine from England should be submitted as soon as possible.
( 2 ) The statistics supplied by Dr. Garden showing how the occurrences of small pox epidemics have heretofore been affected by the practice of inoculation are likely to prove of value, in connexion with the discussions which occur from time to time, as to the expediency or otherwise of allowing the practice, to continue. 4. It is satisfactory to learn that scarcely any complaints of a serious character have been made against any of the establishments of the Vaccine Department. 5. The acknowledgements of the Lieutenant Governor will be conveyed to the following Officers, Lieutenant-Colonel McNeile, Commissioner, Delhi. Mr. Fitzpatrick, Deputy Commissioner of Delhi. Lieutenant Colonel Mercer, Deputy Commissioner, Syalkot. Dr. Ross, the Civil Surgeon of Bunnu. Dr. Courtney, the Civil Sorgeon of Dera Imael Khan. Commendatory letters from this office will be addressed to, His Highness the Raja of Mundi; Mahbub Baksh Khan, Honorary Magistrate of Delhi; Gunga Ram, Municipal Com- missioner of Multan; Members of the Municipal Committee of Syalkote.

ANNUAL REPORT ON VACCINE OPERATIONS IN THE PUNJAB FOR THE YEAR 1867. From A. M. Garden, Esquire, Superintendent -General of Vaccination, Punjab, to the Secretary to Government, Punjab. Work finished in the Kar- maul district. 1. I finished work in the Karnaul district in the month of January. The opposition met with in the city of Paniput, and mentioned in my last report, was in a great measure overcome, and a large number of people there were vaccinated. Good example set by Na- wab &quot;Amanoolah Khan&quot; of Karnaul. Nawab &quot;Amanoolah Khan,&quot; an Honorary Magistrate of the city, was the first to set a good example by having the people of his household vaccinated. He also succeeded in getting many friends and others living near him to receive vaccination, and in this manner operations became gradually more extended in the town. A good deal of work still remains to be done there. Bad example set by Sheikh &quot;Bholee Búksh&quot; of Karnaul. Sheikh &quot;Bholee Buksh,&quot; a man of considerable influence in the town, would give no assistance. He is also an Honorary Ma- gistrate, and was formerly a Tahsildar, and now, I be- lieve, receives a pension from Government. When I first visited him, he was very ill, and his recovery was considered hopeless by the Hukeems who attend- ed him. I succeeded in curing him. &quot;When ill, he was profuse in his pro- testations of the assistance he would render to the vaccinators, but when he had.got well, he would give no help. Dehli. But small progress made. 2. I next visited the Dehli district. Major McMahon, the Deputy Commissioner, gave me all the assistance in his power. Rather more than the usual opposition was here met with, and the greater part of the district was badly vaccinated. &quot;Raja Lall,&quot; Tahsildar of Bullubghur, exerted himself well, and this Tahsil was better done than any other. In the city, the opposition was very great. The Honorary Magistrates and Municipal Committee frequently promised to assist the vaccinators, but they did not do so. Rawulpindi district. 3. When as much work as could be accomplished was done in the Dehli district, the weather becoming hot, I sent several vaccinators into the lower hills for work there, and- myself proceeded to Rawalpindi and carried on vaccinations in and about Murree during the hot weather and rains. No opposition was offered to the vaccinators in these hills. There are comparatively few villages situated at a sufficient elevation to allow of vaccination being carried on throughout the hot weather, and in consequence I had considerable difficulty in keeping up the vaccine disease. Early in October, the weather becoming cool enough, I left the higher hills, and carried on work in the other parts of this district.
( 2 ) Difficulties met with at Attock and in the Chuch. Tahsildar &quot;Doorga Per- shad's&quot; tact. Small-pox spreading from Huzara originating from &quot;inoculation.&quot; The epidemic checked through arrangements made by Major Hall. In some places the people were very difficult to deal with, and this was especially the case about Attock and in the Chuch. The Tahsildar of Attock, &quot;Doorga Per- shad,&quot; deserves great praise for the way in which he managed these people. He was untiring in his efforts, and I trust that his exertions may meet with the favorable notice of His Honor the Lieutenant- Governor. The names of the other Tahsildars, Lumberdars, &c., who gave good assistance, have been mentioned by me to Major Hall, the Deputy Com- missioner. Small-pox had broken out in many places in this district, having spread here from the Huzara hills, where &quot;inoculators&quot; had been largely at work. The arrangements made by Major Hall for getting the people quickly vaccinated were perfect, and the epidemic, which would doubtless have been very severe, was checked. Major Hall has always taken great interest in the work of vaccination, and gave me all the assistance in his power, and in consequence, notwithstanding that the people, as above stated, were very difficult to be dealt with, a great deal of work has been accomplished in the district. Evidences of work done by the Dispensary vaccinators. During my tour through the district, I saw evidences that a very fair amount of work had been done in former years by the Dispensary vaccinators. In almost every large village several children were brought to me with marks of successful vaccinations on their arms; this work had been done almost entirely by vaccinator &quot;Jai Sing.&quot; I took &quot;Jai Sing&quot; with me wherever I went, and found him to be a very popular man. He has been taken into the Punjab Vaccine Establishment, and is now a Native Superintendent. This is the only district I have visited where I have seen that work has been honestly done by the Dispensary vaccinators. The Rawulpindi district is a very large one. On this account, and because of the villages in most places being at long distances from one another, a great deal of time was necessarily spent in it. Work was commenced there on the 7th October, and a considerable amount still remains to be done. 4. In December I visited the several districts from Lahore down to Dehli, inspecting the work being done there. Lahore. But little work done in the city. Proposes that the Honor- ary Magistrates should give assistance. In the Lahore district I found the vaccinators had been working well. In the villages no opposition had been met with, but in the city very little had been done. This is the case in most of the larger towns, and unless the Honorary Magistrates can be induced to take some interest in the work, I fear it will remain so. It would, I think, be a good plan were the Honorary Magistrates in turn to devote themselves to this work. If one at a time in each town would undertake to get a certain number of the streets vaccinated to the best of his ability, something would doubtless be done. As a body they readily enough promise to assist, but nothing comes of it.
( 3 ) Amritsar work well done. In the Amritsar district all was going on most favorably. The people of the villages I visited spoke in favor of vac- cination, and seemed really to appreciate its value. They also highly praised the conduct of the Native Superintendent and vaccina- tors. I would recommend that this man, Native Superintendent &quot;Doonee Chund,&quot; should receive some reward. Jullundhur. Objections made to chil- dren being taken from one village to another. In Jullundhur work was going on well, but slowly. Mr. Elsmie takes much interest in it. The people did not appear to object to vaccination, but complained of children who had been already vaccinated being taken from one village to another. I have issued orders which will I trust in a great measure obviate this, but I do not see how it can be altoge- ther done away with. It is frequently absolutely necessary, in order that vaccinations may be performed from arm to arm, and where it is not abso- lutely necessary, the work is much delayed if it is not done, and many failures result. After all it is no great hardship to take a child with its parent a distance of a mile or two. The parent receives pay, and the child food or sweetmeats. One person undergoes a small amount of inconvenience for the benefit of many. Hoshiarpore and Kang- ra. From want of time I was quite unable to visit the Hoshiarpore and Kangra districts. Mr. Perkins, the Deputy Commis- sioner of Hoshiarpore, praises highly the conduct of &quot;Kahn Chund,&quot; the Native Superintendent on duty there. Ludianah. In Ludianah very little work indeed had been done. No success. Vaccination has never succeeded in this district. The Native Super- intendent whom I have placed there is one of my best men. The Tahsildars take little or no interest in the work; were they to exert themselves, I can see no reason why there should be any more difficulty in this district than in the others I have visited. Success in the Jageer of Mallowd, in district of Ludianah. In the Jageer of Mallowd, the Native Superintendent reports he met with no opposition, the Sirdar there having assisted him. If the same amount of assistance was given in other parts of this district, the people would doubtless be induced to overcome their aversion to vaccination. Amballa. In the Amballa district work was also going on very favorably. Karnaul. The city vaccinated. The first year this city has been free from small- pox. In Karnaul, Dr. Newton, the Civil Surgeon, succeeded in get- ting a great number of the towns-people vaccinated. &quot;Nujjuf Khan,&quot; Tahsildar of Dehli, whose home is in Karnaul, assisted the vaccinators here of his own accord, and was of much help to them. I trust that favorable notice of the help he gave will be taken, as it was through his means that a large part of the city wasvaccinated. The inhabitants seem to begin to under- stand the value of vaccination. They say that this is the first year they can remember the city having been entirely free from small-pox.
(( 4 )) A great deal of work was also done in the villages of the Garounda Tahsil, the Tahsildar having given good assistance. Small-pox not very pre- valent in the Punjab. Small-pox has appeared, but has not spread in theSmall-pox has not been districts where the establish- ment has worked. 5. Small-pox has not been so prevalent in the Punjab this year as in former years. In the several districts visited by the establishment, there have been much fewer deaths from this disease. It is satisfactory to know that, although small-pox has appeared in several districts where the establishment has worked, it has not in one instance spread throughout the dis- trict, as was almost invariably the case formerly. This, the fact of its not becoming epidemic, and not the numbers said to have been vaccinated, should be taken as the true criterion of the value of the work performed. Falling off in the numbers vaccinatëd and its 'cause. 6. Compared with the last return, there is a considerable falling off in the numbers vaccinated. This was caused by the difficulty found in supervising the operations in the Rawulpindi district on account of its large size, and the compara- tive paucity of its population. The villages too, in many places, are separat- ed by long distances from each other, and it was found impossible to see the- work done in the more distant ones. The vaccinators had therefore to be concentrated, and during part of the time many of them, though not altoge- ther idle, had not their time fully occupied. With an active Assistant, I think I could have finished this district in little more than half the time taken. Simla Small-pox Hospital. Used for both cholera and small-pox patients. 7. In my last report, when speaking of the Simla Small-pox Hospital, I stated that I considered it was unsuitable both from its construction and from its situation, giving my reasons. It has, however, been allowed to remain, and this year was used as a hospital both for small-pox and cholera patients. On more than one occasion patients attacked with cholera were sent there, and contracted small-pox from their neighbours suffering with that disease. I at once, on hearing this, addressed the Chairman, Simla Municipal Committee, and received from him a reply that the building was so used at the request of the Officers in Medical charge of Simla. I can here only repeat that I adhere to my opinion formerly expressed, and state that I consider it very objectionable that a Small-pox Hospital should be used for any other pur- pose than that originally intended. Conduct of the vaccina- tors very good. 8. The behaviour of the vaccinators as a body has been very good. Only one or two very trivial complaints were made against some of them. One Native Superintendent, whose general conduct was very bad, I was obliged to discharge. Some have worked exceptionally well. I would beg to recommend that rewards be given, to the amount of one month's pay (Rs. 40), to Native- Superintendents &quot;Bullie Ram&quot; and &quot;Doonee Chund,&quot; they having both worked exceedingly well. &quot;Doonee Chund's&quot; name I mentioned when speak- ing of the Amritsar district. &quot;Bullie Ram&quot; belonged to the old Simla Vaccine Establishment. He has worked well for six years, during the whole of which time I have never once had occasion to find the slightest fault with him.
( 5 ) * * * * * * * Vaccination in the city of Amritsar. 10. Vaccinations were performed in the city of Amritsar by Hukeem &quot;Motee Ram,&quot; during the entire year. Dr. McRae, Deputy Inspector General of Hospitals, and Dr. Hender- son, Civil Surgeon of Amritsar, inspected several of these cases in the month of July, and pronounced the vesicles to be excellent. I tried to do the same in a few places, but did not consider the results so successful as to warrant my continuing the practice. 1,020 operations were performed in the city of Amritsar, of which 810 were successful. &quot; Motee Ram&quot; was employed under the Hukeem system in Amritsar, but was discharged for misconduct. He has, however, since then continued vaccinations in the city. 11. In the year 1866, inoculation for small-pox was practiced in &quot; Kanawar,&quot; a part of the district of &quot;Bisahir,&quot; situated under the snowy range north-east of Simla. The disease spread, and a great many people died in consequence. Vaccinations introdneed into Thibet by Mr. Pagell, Missionary. I sent vaccinators there, and also gave vaccine to Mr. Pagell, a Mis- sionary, who resides in those parts. I had previously given Mr. Pagell instructions in vaccination. On the outbreak of small-pox in &quot; Kanawar,&quot; I begged Mr. Pagell to use his influence in getting the people vaccinated both there and if possible beyond the frontier. He has since informed me that his efforts have been successful, and that in Thibet he has vaccinated about 700 people. Mr. Pagell is sanguine of being able to carry on operations in Thibet next hot weather. 12. Appended to this Report are numerical returns of operations per- formed during the year. VACCINATION AT DISPENSARIES. 13. There is not much to be said respecting the Dispensary Vaccine operations. As far as I can learn, the rule of keeping vaccinators within easy reach of Civil Surgeons is more strictly kept. Abbottabad. About Abbottabad and in the Huzara District, there was a good deal of small-pox during the latter.half of the year, originat- ing from inoculations having been freely practised there. The disease spread from thence into the Rawulpindi District. Bunnoo. In Bunnoo ' inoculators' were also at work. Dr. Ross, the Civi Surgeon, tried to put a stop to it, and is in hopes that he has persuaded an inoculator to give up his old prac tice and take to vaccination instead. Dera Ismael Khan. Success among the Po- windas. In the Dera Ismael Khan District, Dr. Courtney was very successful in introducing vaccination among the Powinrequested him to employ one, and das. He vaccinated a large number of them at the Dispensary and several hundreds at their encampments. He states that they appear fully alive to the advantages of vaccination. He feels the want of a Pushtoo-speaking vaccinator to work among them, and I have requested him to employ one, and if possible a Powinda. Dr. Courtney is deserving of praise for his successful efforts.
( 6 ) Small-pox in the Sealkote district. In the Syalkot district, small-pox has been prevalent for years, and during this year was epidemic. Major Mercer, the De- puty Commissioner, urgently requested me to visit the district with my establishment. Precautions taken to pre- vent its spreading. Extra vaccinators enter- tained. Their operations not suc- cessful. Assistance given by the Hukeems. I was then in the Rawulpindi district, where small-pox had appeared in several places, and was unable to comply with his request Major Mercer took all precautions possible to prevent the spread of the disease, and was to a great extent successful. He also entertained extra vaccina- tors and used every endeavour to get the people vaccinated. A very large number were vaccinated, but unfortunately with but little success. It was the old story of want of European superintendence. In the latter part of the year I sent a Native Superintendent and some vaccinators into the district. Their work was confined chiefly to the town of Syalkot and surrounding villages. They worked well and successfully and succeeded in gaining the confidence of the people. The Sub-Assistant Surgeon, B. M. Mitter, took great pains to explain vaccination to the people. He sent me a very good report on the origin and spread of small-pox in the district, and of the measures taken to check its progress, and also pointed out the reason for the want of success in the operations pre- formed early in the year. He deserves commendation for his exertions. The head of the Hukeem system of this district, Hu- keem &quot;Bora,&quot; was of much assistance to my Native Superintendent. The Hukeems of this district appear willing to assist in the work of vaccination. Honorary Magistrates Boodh Sing and Radha Kishen also exerted themselves, and with their assistance a considerable part of the city was vaccinated. Vaccinations difficult in Military Cantonments. 14. Great difficulty is always found in vaccinating the people in the bazars, &c., in Military Cantonments, and I think that Government should be moved to order that all people residing in Cantonments should, if unprotected, be vaccinated, or be liable to be turned out in the event of small-pox appearing. This plan has been found to answer well with private servants. There were several cases of small-pox in the Cantonments in Syalkot, and one officer contracted the disease. Proposes that candidates for Government employ should be vaccinated. Dr. Pearson, the Superintendent-General of Vaccination, North- Western Provinces, proposed that Government should exact from all future candidates for Government employ a certificate of having been successfully vaccinated (in the absence of hav- ing had natural or inoculated small-pox ) as a necessary condition cf their being entertained. The Lieutenant-Governor approved of the recommenda- tion, and directed that orders to that effect should be issued. I think that this should also be done in the Punjab. Five more Dispensaries supplied with vaccinators from Punjab Vaccine De- partment. 15. This year five more Dispensaries ( making in all thirteen) have been supplied with vaccinators from the Punjab Vaccine Establishment. 16. Numerical returns of the operations performed at Dispensaries are appended.

Annual Report on Vaccine operations in the Punjab for the year 1869, FROM A. M. GARDEN, ESQUIRE, M. D., SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL OF VACCINATION, PUNJAB. TO T. H. THORNTON, ESQUIRE, SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, PUNJAB. SIR, I have the honor to submit for the information of His Honor the Lieutenant Governor, my Report on Vaccine Operations in the Punjab, for the year 1869. Numbers vaccinated by Provincial Establishment.( 2 ) Tehseel, work went on very well. Some of the zaildars of this District gave very good assistance to the vaccinators. Gholam Kadur, zaildar of Wuzeerabad, helped them from the first, and was the only one of that part who did so; Meer Fuzl, zaildar of Behuk, was also of much use to them. Mr. R. Bose, Sub Assistant Surgeon, had carried on vaccination very satisfactorily in and about the town of Gujranwalla. 3. Gurdaspoor.( 3 ) Phillour Nou Baharudeen, gave me every assistance, and I particularly wish to bring his services to notice. 6. Cities of Lahore and Umritsur( 4 ) Tears.

This, too, does not shew the mortality among those who, reduced in health and strength by it, became afterwards easy victims to other diseases. Many also undoubtedly suffer throughout their lives from its effects, having become blind or otherwise maimed. Deaths from Cholera in the Punjab.( 5 ) Surgeon who has undertaken the work, reports that the animals are quite wild and unman- ageable, and that he has much difficulty with them: he will doubtless succeed after a time. VACCINATION AT DISPENSARIES. In some Districts vaccination could not be carried on at the commencement of the season, on account of the great amount of sickness prevalent. Dr. Bellew at Peshawur found it impossible to begin work till December, and this was the case in other parts, and will account for the falling off in numbers at those places. In a few Districts there has been a large increase. In Dera Ghazee Khan there is an increase of 1,906. (( 6 )) NUMERICAL RETURN OF VACCINATIONS PERFORMED AT DISPENSARIES FOR THE YEAR 1869. DISTRICTS.

No injurious effects of vaccinating children suffering from Hooping Cough.( 12 ) In September a few cases of small-pox occurred in the lower part of Kulú and Sooltan- poor, a Native Superintendent and a Vaccinator were sent out with fresh lymph, and directed to vaccinate all unprotected either by small-pox or vaccination; I am happy to say it did not spread or extend up the valley, and as far as I could ascertain, was confined to one or two villages, and the great majority of cases occurred in middle aged persons, which, I think is proof, that a large number of children must have been well protected by the vaccine disease. 23.

READ( 2 ) that it should be authoritatively enforced, and rendered compulsory; but with reference to the quarantine measures suggested in para. 9 of the report, he considers it desirable, as intimated last year, that every practicable measure should be adopted to prevent the healthy, and those afflicted with small pox, from associating together, as is now too generally the case ; while the fumiga- tion of the clothes of those who have been attacked, is a precautionary measure to be as strongly urged, as the keeping of infected persons away from the rest of the community. 4. Every effort should be made to put a stop to the strange and injuri- ous practices described in the 7th paragraph of the report, wherever they are still found to exist. 5. The circumstance of some of the Viceroy's sheep at Simla having been attacked with small pox, does not appear to have been brought to notice. 6. Of the several matters noted in the Report to which special attention should be drawn, none are of more importance than the marked contrast pre- sented by the conduct of the subordinate Government Officials and Municipal Committees of the cities of Amritsur and Lahore, with those of Jullundhur and Delhi; and the failure of the officers of Government to afford assistance to the Vaccine Establishment in overcoming the opposition they met with in the Wazírabad Tehsil of the Gujeranwalla District, and throughout the Gurdaspore District generally. The attention of the Commissioners of Amritsur and Lahore is specially requested to these points. His Honor observes that if the paid Officers of Government fail to assist in such cases, this fact alone must tend greatly to repress exertion on the part of influential men amongst the people themselves. He desires, with reference to the description of the operations in the Jullundhur City, given in the 4th paragraph of the Report, that Commissioners and District Officers should be urged to lose no opportunity of impressing on Municipal Committees, the great importance of their assisting cordially in this work, which cannot be expected to prosper if they evince indifference, but will certainly do so, if they exert themselves and encourage the people. It is by such co-operation on the part of these bodies that satisfactory results may be attained, rather than by the compulsory measures advocated by Doctor Garden. 7. With reference to Doctor Newton's Report on his operations abo Nuggur, His Honor observes that there is probably no part of the cou
( 3 ) in which European Medical skill, and European Medicines are so highly ap- preciated as throughout the hills generally, and it is most satisfactory to find the people of those regions generally becoming aware of the benefits of vaccination. 8. The acknowledgments of the Hon'ble the Lieutenant Governor will be communicated to Mr. A. Brandreth, formerly Deputy Commissioner Gujeranwalla; Mr. L. Saunders, Deputy Commissioner Jullundhur ; Major McMahon, Deputy Commissioner of Delhi, and to Doctor Penny, Civil Surgeon of Delhi, who has at all times exerted himself in a very special manner, and with great success, in guiding and encouraging the Municipality in all sanitary matters, as well as in all others affecting the public weal, and who is accord- ingly especially entitled to the cordial acknowledgments of Government. His Honor also acknowledges the services rendered by Doctor Warburton at Jullundhur, and by Extra Assistant Commissioner Syad Hadí Hossein; by Mr. Nulty at Sirsa; by Sub-Assistant Surgeon R. Bose at Gujeranwalla; by the members generally of the Municipal Committees of Delhi and Jullundhur, and especially by Sulukun Mull and Pundit Ram Ditta, two members of the latter Committee, who co-operated most cordially. 9. With reference to the recommendation made in para 10 of the Report, in favor of the Native Superintendent of Vaccination Nyaz Ali Shah, it is to be observed that the giving of rewards to officials for zealous performance of their duties has been discountenanced by the Government, but the meritorious con- duct of this Native Superintendent should be borne in mind by his Departmental Officers, and should ensure him promotion on a fitting occasion. 10. The exertions of the Tahsildar of Phillor, Nou-Bahurúdín, will be brought to the notice of the Commissioner of Jullundhur, and that of the Tahsildar of Hafizabad, Arjunund, and those of Zaildars Gholam Kadar, Mir Frzl,and others, will be similarly brought to the notice of the Commissioner of Lahore, who will be requested to cause efforts to be made to secure a more general and cordial co-operation in the Districts of his Division. 11. The services of Hossein Shah, resident of Bátalá, referred to in Doctor Newton's report, will also be brought to the notice of the Commissioner of Amritsur, as it is in marked contrast to that of the Tahsildar, Mahummed ram, and consequently all the more commendable; the apathy and want sal of that official calls for special notice.
( 4 ) 12. The services of the following Zaildars, named by Doctor Newton, will also he brought to the notice of the Commissioner :SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT ON VACCINE OPERATIONS IN THE PUNJAB.

REPORT ON VACCINE OPERATIONS IN THE PUNJAB DURING THE SEASON 1870-71. BY SURGEON ISAAC NEWTON, M. R. C. S., LONDON, Officiating Superintendent-General of Vaccination for the Punjab. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] SIMLA: PRINTED AT THE SIMLA DAILY ADVERTISER PRESS, 1871.
From ISAAC NEWTON, ESQ., Offg. Superintendent General of Vaccination, Punjab. To LEPEL H. GRIFFIN, ESQ., Offg. Secretary to Government, Punjab, and its Dependencies. SIR, I HAVE the honor to submit for the information of His Honor the Lieutenant Governor, the Report on the Vaccine operations in the Punjab, during the year 1870-71. Change in the annual Report from the Calendar year to the Financial year. 2. During the latter part of 1869, the Vaccine year was ordered to be changed from the Calendar year to the period em- braced by the Financial year. Accordingly a Supplementary Report was submitted by Dr. Garden, Superintendent General, in May last, for the three months intervening between the Report for 1869 and the present one. In October Dr. Gar- den left India on medical certificate. 3. During the first half of the period embraced in this report, namely, the hot months, I held the appointment of Superintendent of vaccination, Punjab. In October I was appointed to officiate as Superintendent General, during the absence of Dr. Garden, who was obliged to leave India on account of ill health. Total of all Vaccine operations. 4. The total number of vaccine operations performed in the Punjab by all establishments is 221,449. The percentage of suc- cess in primary vaccinations is 85.03, and in re-vaccinations 59.88. The average number of persons vaccinated by each vaccinator is 1090.88. The cost of each successful case is annas four and pies 4.08. This is shewn in Statement No. VII. The total number of persons vaccinated is in the ratio of 1.26 per cent. to the total population. Estimating the annual birth rate for the Punjab at 3 per cent. of the total pupulation (17,481,189) we shall have about 524,433 children born annually. Comparing the total number of persons successfully vaccinated during the present year (192689) we find it is in the pro- portion of 36.74 per cent. of the annual number of births. Resumé of works performed since the formation of the Punjab Vaccine Es- tablishment. 5. Before entering into details of the past year's operations. I think it would be well to give a brief resumé of what has been done since the formation of the Punjab Vaccine Establishment. Previously to 1864, Dr. Garden held the appointment of Superin- tendent Vaccination Hill States, and carried on vaccine operations only in the hills. In the plains vaccination was carried on by vac- cinators attached to Dispensaries, varying in number, pay and time employed. In October 1864, the new establishment was sanctioned and was organised by Dr. Garden in the November following.
[ 2 ] Cold season of 1864- 65. During the cold season of 1864-65 the districts of Lahore and Umritsur were vaccinated by a staff consisting of 15 Native Superintendents and 34 vaccinators. During the hot months and rains part of the Kangra district, the Chumba state and neighbourhood of Simla were visited. Cold season of 1865- 66. During the cold season of 1865-66 the district of Hoshiarpore, Jullundhur, Loodiana and part of Umballa were visited. Reorganization of Dispensary Estab- lishment. At the commencement of this cold season the Dispensary Es- tablishment was re-organized, two vaccinators were now to be attached permanently to each Dispensary to work in the cities and villages near at hand, so that the Civil Surgeon could supervise their work. During the hot months, the hill states of Sirmoor and Nalagurh, hills beyond Simla, were visited and vaccinators sent to Bishahir, Kulu and the Kangra hills. Cold season of 1866- 67. During the cold season of 1866-67 the remainder of the Um- balla district, Kurnal and Delhi were vaccinated. During the hot months, in Murree and the surrounding vil- lages and cooler parts of the Rawalpindee district were visited. Cold season of 1867- 68. During the cold season of 1867-68, the Rawalpindee and Sealkote districts were vaccinated. During the hot months, Chumba and Pangi as far as Tri- lognath and villages bordering Lahoul and in Simla. Cold season of 1868- 69. During the cold season of 1868-69 the remaining part of the Sealkote district, Goojranwalla and part of Goordaspore were vac- cinated. In November 1868, the appointment of a Superintendent of Vaccination was sanctioned and I was appointed to the post. In the hot months of 1869 the Hills about Simla, Kulu and Dhurmsala were visited. Cold season of 1869- 70. During the cold season of 1869-70 the Goordaspore district was finished and the Jullundur and part of Loodiana were visited. From the above it will be observed that during the six cold or working seasons that the Punjab Vaccine Establishment has been at work, twelve new districts have been vaccinated and one district a second time, being an average of a little over two districts each year. These twelve districts have an area of 28,785 square miles, and a population of 9,364,865. At the same time a Native Superintendent and four or five vaccinators under him, have been left in each of these districts to vaccinate every year. During the corresponding hot seasons, all the hill states inclu- ding Spiti and Lahoul, and the Kangra district and Kulu have been visited, some more than once. During the hot sea- son Dr Garden was in charge. 6. From the 1st April to 19th of October, Dr. Garden, the Superintendent General was in charge. As above stated he had to proceed to England on medical certificate. In April he was carry- ing on vaccine operations in the Simla Bazars. The Keonthal State. Dr. Garden states, that having sent a letter from the Commis- sioner of Umballa to the Rajah of Keonthal regarding vaccinating his son and also the Sirmoor Rajah's son who was living with him,
[ 3 ] he still refused to allow either of them to be vaccinated and also declined to have vaccination performed in his state. Shortly after this, the Rajah of Keonthal visited Simla and there promised Dr. Garden that the two children should be vaccinated early in October, saying positively nothing should interfere with this, but in October Dr. Garden says he again refused and also to allow any in his own house to be vaccinated. The proximity of this state to Simla ren- ders it most desirable that it should be properly vaccinated. As long as the Keonthal Raja objects to have his own children vac- cinated, there is little doubt it is because he prefers inoculation, and until his own son is vaccinated he will not give proper assistance to have the people in his state vaccinated. Vaccination is now carried on in all the other hill states with approval and assistance of the several Rajahs, &c. Small pox in Komar- sen. 7. In May a report came from the district of Komarsen, 40 miles East of Simla, that small pox was raging there; vaccinators were at once despatched and Dr. Garden followed them shortly after. On enquiry from the villagers it was found that about twenty men and women, including three young men, and no children had small pox, the disease having been brought from near Roopur in the Umballa district by a man who had attended a fair there, on visiting the Rana this statement was confirmed by him. This is I think a fair triumph for vaccination, as the children escaping, must have been well protected. The villagers of the infected places were not allowed any communication with the others and vaccinations were performed all round and the disease speedily stopped. Vaccination perform- ed in Kotkhae. 8. In this month vaccination was also carried on in Kote- khae. Small pox Hospital in Simla. 9. Dr. Garden states that he visited the Small Pox Hospital in Simla, and found it in a wretched condition. On this subject Dr. Garden addressed a letter to the Civil Surgeon, suggesting this should be brought to the notice of the Municipal Committee and recom- mending that the rooms, bedding and charpoys should be cleansed and fumigated on the recovery or death of the patient, and the blankets kept under lock and key. The Civil Surgeon informs me that most of these suggestions have been carried out. Difficulty in the Simla Bazar. Operations during the hot season under the Superintendent. 11. Vaccine operations were carried on under me, during the period I was Superintendent Vaccination (1st April to 19th Octo- ber) in the Hazara hills and in Murree and the surrounding hills. I only experienced difficulty in Abbottabad and the villages immediately surrounding it, and this was owing to inoculators of some repute residing in one of the larger villages. As soon as I left this neighbourhood and consequently the influence of these inocu- 10. Much difficulty has always been experienced in vaccina ting the Bazars in Simla. In the report for 1869, Dr. Garden states &quot;as small pox invariably appears there (in the bazars) yearly among&quot; &quot;the people who come from the plains[ 4 ] lators, I had no more difficulty; on the contrary the head men received me cordially and took to vaccination readily and gladly, and I won their hearts, by giving them the advantage of European medical aid, and in one special case, the head man of the village was brought to my tent on a charpoy supposed to be dying with low Remittent Fever, and before I left the village, he was able to walk from his house up a steep hill to see me. Inoculators near Abbottabad. 12. The Deputy Commissioner, Captain Ommanney, who has discountenanced inoculation in his district as much as possible, called the inoculators who resided near to Abbottabad, to see me, and talked to them on the advantages of vaccination over inocula- tion and tried to persuade them to practise the former, but I fear it is hopeless. Proximity of a vil- lage in Hazara to the Cashmere territory. 13. In one village near the Jhelum, as it issues from the Cashmere territory, small pox appeared to have been more preva- lent, much more so than in the other villages visited, nearly all had had the disease. I could not account for this, except perhaps the close proximity to Cashmere, where inoculation is generally prac- tised, may have something to do with this. Vaccination in vil- lages along the new road from Abbotta- bad to Murree. 14. During the month of June vaccination was carried on, in the villages along the new road from Abbottabad to Murree, arriving at the latter place as the rainy season set in. During the rains vaccination in vil- lages near Murree. 15. During July, August and September vaccine operations were carried on in the villages in the neighbourhood of Murree. The villagers in these parts appeared to be quite alive to the beneficial effects of vaccination, they brought their children wil- lingly, and on more than one occasion the headman of the village said to me spontaneously, that since they had had their children vaccinated, there had been no more small pox in their villages. Native Superintend- ent Jai Singh. The Native Superintendent Jai Singh has worked long in this district and I saw many signs during the time I was in the Murree hills, that he was a general favorite and had gained an influence amongst the people. Lawrence Memorial Asylum. 16. On the 13th July and on several other occasions I visited the Lawrence Memorial Asylum, there were at this time 67 boys and 57 girls: these I examined carefully to ascertain to what ex- tent they were protected from an attack of small pox. The result as shewn below is anything but satisfactory, and if this may be taken, as the usual state of things in European Regiments I think it is absolutely necessary that some steps should be taken for the better protection of European children in this country. Number and charac- ter of vaccine cicat- rices on the children. Out of 123 children examined only 28 had more than two scars or cicatrices, and of these 16 were very poor, or being of very doubtful protection, 19 had no marks whatever of ever having been successfully vaccinated; but of these six were marked with small pox scars. The above will be better seen from the annexed table[ 5 ] The practice in some Regiments to vacci- nate only in three places. 17. I fear it is too commonly believed that it does not matter much as to the number of vaccine vesicles produced, or that their character greatly modifies the amount of protection afforded by the operation. From the inspection of the above children it was evident that in some regiments it was the usual practice to vaccinate only on one arm in not more than three places. I cannot too strongly ex- press the fact that the protective power of vaccination is in direct ratio to the number and quantity of the vesicles produced. The protection affor- ded by vaccination is in direct ratio to the number and quality of the vac- cine vesicles. 18. The following table taken from Dr. Seeton's hand-book of vaccination will illustrate the last remark, as shewing the result of nearly 5,000 cases of post-vaccinal Small Pox with the percentage of deaths classified according to the character and number of the vaccine marks: Number of deaths per cent. 1. Unvaccinated ... ... ... ... ... 35 2. Stated to have been vaccinated but having no cicatrix. ... 23.57 3. Vaccinated[ 6 ] In 1869-70, the Districts of Jullundur and Goordaspore were visited with an establishment of nine Native Superintendents and 34 Vaccinators, and vaccinated in these two districts no less than 78,405, whereas, this year, the districts of Lahore and Loodiana were visited with an establishment of 12 Native Superintendents- and 47 Vaccinators, and only succeeded in vaccinating 35,713, shewing a decrease of 42,692 persons vaccinated, and an increase of establishment of three Native Superintendents and 13 Vacci- nators. In addition to the above, the number of persons vaccinated in 1869-70, was an unusually large number, being 15,344 more than in 1868 and 49,594 more than in 1867. Dispensary Estab- lishment. 24. The Dispensary Establishment consists of 27 vaccinators on Rs. 10 a month, and 27 on Rs. 8, superintended by the Civil Surgeons. Number vaccinated by Dispensary Es- tablishment. The number of persons vaccinated by the Dispensary Estab- lishment is 61,600, being a decrease of 12,039, upon the work per- formed in 1869. The number of successful cases is 59,569, being 81.03 per cent. excluding cases re-vaccinated and unknown. Cost. The total cost of the Dispensary Establishment being Rs. 5838, each successful case cost a fraction less than two annas. Locally entertained Establishment. 25. Twenty-seven Vaccinators have been employed and paid by Municipalities, Local Funds and Native Chiefs, Rupees 1114, annas 4 and pies seven. Number vaccinated by Local Establish- ment. The number of persons vaccinated by this Establishment is 18,625. The percentage of success in primary vaccinations is 85.03 and in secondary vaccinations 59.88 The cost of each successful case is one anna and a fraction over five pies. Introduction of two rates of pay into the Punjab. 26. In April sanction was received from the Supreme Gov- ernment, to the introduction into the Punjab of having two rates of pay for the Establishment, one for the working months, the other for the hot or non-working months, Vaccinators receiving three-fifths and Native Superintendents four-fifths of their pay during the time they are on leave. Previous to this new arrangement, the Native Superintendent and his Vaccinators were sent to attend the Dispen- saries and were of much use, on many occasions, such as out-breaks of epidemics, &c. New plan of opera- tions. Former dis- tricts to be visited over again. 27. In September Dr. Garden proposed to His Honor the Lieutenant Governor, that instead of going over new districts each year with the Establishment, a few of the old districts should be visited over and over again, so as if possible to keep small pox out of them, so that these districts could be held up as examples of the good effects of efficient vaccination, and it is hoped the people will then be convinced. This arrangement received the sanction of the late Lieutenant Governor Sir H. M. Durand; and was carried out this cold season. The original plan was to visit with a large num- ber of vaccinators each district in the Punjab in turn. Each district when vaccinated to have a Native Superintendent and a certain number of Vaccinators left in it, to go over the ground again. It was believed that they could go over the whole district in two or three years, but experience has shewn that they cannot, and the consequence is that small pox still prevails to a large extent in many of these districts.
[ 7 ] Cold seasons opera- tions. 28. In November I commenced work in the Loodiana town and district. Loodiana Town. The Deputy Commissioner Mr. L. Cowan, convened a meeting of the Municipality and spoke to them regarding vaccination in the city, and urged them to give me all the assistance in their power. For about three weeks I went daily into the city, each day vac- cinating two or three streets, accompanied by two or three members of the municipality, much time was necessarily spent in vaccinating a large town like this, street by street, but the success, only obtain- able by this method, I think warranted it. The people of the town of Loodiana had, until last year, obsti- nately objected to vaccination, and had in consequence suffered very severely from epidemics of small pox. The deaths from this disease in 1869 were 124, all childern under 10 years of age. Members of Munici- pal Committee who assisted. The following Members of the Municipal Committee assisted me in the town, Narain Dos, Aimud Shah, Jaintee Dos and Ramjee Dos. But my success was mainly due to Narain Dos and Aimud Shah, the former I regret to say died a few days after I had finished work in the town. The latter is brother to Ahsan Shah, a wealthy Cashmere Merchant, who was the first to come forward and assist the Vaccinators last year. He has considerable influence amongst the Mahomedan portion of the city, and nearly the whole of this caste, now vaccinated, was done through his assistance, and I beg to bring his name prominently to notice. Small pox said to have followed vac- cination. On one or two occasions in this town respectable men with whom I was talking and trying to persuade to bring their children to be vaccinated, stated before a concourse of people that their children had been vaccinated, but they took small pox, conse- quently it was useless. On going to the house to see the children I invariably found no marks or cicatrices of their having been suc- cessfully vaccinated. Number vaccinated in the city. 29. The total number of persons vaccinated in the city is 1077 of which 914 were successful, and the previous year Dr. Garden succeeded in vaccinating about 1000, so that I trust now sufficient has been done to remove much of the prejudice the people have hi- therto shewn against vaccination. Loodiana Pergunnah. 30. I regret to say the work in the Loodiana Pergunnah was carried on, under great difficulties, the head-men of the villages with few exceptions refusing to give any assistance, the vaccinators time being taken up, in vainly persuading the people to bring their children to be vaccinated. Difficulty in the Loo- diana Pergunnah ow- ing to no assistance being given on the first occasion. Great difficulty has always been experienced in this Pergunnah. If proper assistance had been given at first, this would not have been the case, but when the people have once learnt that the Civil Au- thorities take no interest in vaccination, they naturally ignore the vaccinators and their work. Prevalence of Fever. Fever was very prevalent and added to our difficulties, the whole or greater part of the Tehseel Establishment being laid up, little or no assistance was received from them. This Pergunnah took about seven weeks to vaccinate. The Naib Tehseeldar, Luchmun Dos, gave assistance for two or three days, towards the completion of work in this Pergunnah, which if given sooner, would have been of considerable use. Number vaccinated in the Loodiana Per- gunnah. The number of children vaccinated in this Purgunnah is 3724 of which 3393 were successful.
[ 8 ] Jugraon Pergunnah. 31. Having finished the Loodiana Pergunnah about the 18th December, work was commenced in the Jugraon Pergunnah and completed by the 1st week in January, Naib Tehseeldar Polo Mull, who was officiating Tehseeldar, gave all the assistance in his power. The number vaccinated in this Pergunnah is 2709, of which 2556 were successful. Sumrala Pergunnah. 32. Work was now commenced in the Sumrala Pergunnah and was completed by the end of January. Tehseeldar Lena Singh gave me very good assistance and the work was performed satisfactorily. A number of children Seen with good vac- cine cicatrices. In this Pergunnah I was struck with the number of children I saw who had been successfully vaccinated on previous occasions. Number Vaccinated. The number vaccinated in the Sumrala Pergunnah is 4578 of which 4291 were successful and 156 re-vaccinations. The Principal Towns in the Loodiana dis- trict. 33. This completed the work in the Loodiana district. The principal town in this district (in addition to Loodiana which has been referred to in detail in paras 28-29) are Raikote, having a population of 9,165, in which 215 vaccinations were performed with success. Jugraon with a population of 7096,-85 persons were successfully vaccinated by the Provincial vaccinators, and 594 by the Hospital Assistant at the Branch Dispensary; and Machiwara with 6062 po- pulation and 157 persons successfully vaccinated, and 17 re-vacci- nations. Besides these towns there are 880 villages having a popu- lation of 521,139, in which 10,235 vaccinations were succesfully performed. Total number of Per- sons vaccinated in Loodiana district. The total number of persons vaccinated in this district (12,576) is very small in proportion to the population, which is 583,245. Had proper assistance been rendered, three times the number might have been performed. Roopur Pergunnah (Umballa District.) 34. The Roopur Pergunnah of the Umballa district, was next visited by the Provincial Establishment. Here I met with little or no opposition, except in the towns of Roopur and Morinda. Small Pox Prevail- ing. Small pox was prevailing in the South and East part of this Pergunnah but not to any great extent, and was soon arrested by the vaccination. Immunity from small Pox in some villages attributed to vac- cination in 1866. In my visits, I met with many villages where the people told me there had been no small pox in their villages since the Provin- cial Establishment visited them in 1866. Completion of work and number vacci- nated. The work was completed in this Pergunnah during the month of February and 9463 children were vaccinated. Assistance rendered by Jemadar Kirpa Ram. In this Pergunnah Jemadar Kirpa Ram. who was in charge of the Tehseel rendered me most able assistance, he was indefatigable in his endeavours to persuade the people to have their children vacci- nated, frequently attending me on my visits to the large villages : I trust he may receive some reward for the good service he has done. Town of Roopur. Town of Morinda. In the town of Roopur having a population of 8,700, only 423 persons were vaccinated, and in the town of Morinda having a po- pulation of about 4,000 only 100 persons could be got to be vacci- nated, but in this town small pox had been and was at the time of my visit, very prevalent. Small Pox in Kurr Pergunnah. 35. About this time, the Civil Surgeon of Roopur received a report that small pox had broken out in the Kurr Pergunnah of Umballa district. I immediately sent off a Native Superintendent and staff of vaccinators, and every endeavour was made to arrest the disease. 1998 persons were vaccinated and the disease was soon stamped out.
[ 9 ] Number vaccinated. Hindúr or Nalagurh State. 36. The Hindur (Nalaghur) State which joins the N. E. border of the Rooper Pergunnah, was next visited, the work being first performed in the plains and then in the upper portion or lower hills. Assistance rendered by the Rajah[ 10 ] absence of a better and less dangerous prophylatic as vaccination is; but woe to those neighbouring states or districts that are not so protected, the contagion is sure to spread sooner or later to those unprotected; and this is sufficient reason for prohibiting the practice, more especially in those parts where it is not in general favour with the people. The time chosen for inoculation corres- ponds with the period of increase of mortality from Small Pox. It is worthy of note that the month of March is the time usually chosen for inoculation, and this corresponds with the period of increase of mortality from small pox in the Punjab, it is probable that there is a close connection between the two circumstances. Vaccine operations in the districts that have previously been visi- ted by the Provincial Establishment. 38. In the districts that have already been visited by the Provincial Establishment, vaccinations have been carried on, in most of them favorably. Lahore.[ 11 ] Inspection of work by Dr. Bennett. In March Dr. Bennett inspected the vaccinators' work and reported as follows: &quot; In the city I found two vaccinators at work in the Chashmere part with not a soul to assist them, and no one taking any interest in the work; the Cashmeries seemed very wil- ling to have their children vaccinated, and if the slightest arrange- ment was made a very fair number might be done.&quot; Only 877 persons were vaccinated in the whole city having a population of 135,817, during six months, being an average of 146 a month. Small Pox in the City of Umritsur. This city as might be expected has usually a high mortality from small pox.[ 12 ] City of Delhi. Assistance rendered by the Municipality. The work in the city of Delhi has been very satisfactory duringthis year, due to the great interest taken in vaccination by Major Mac-Mahon, Deputy Commissioner, and Dr. Penny, the Civil Surgeon, together with the able assistance rendered by the Native Members of the Municipality. Five Vaccinators are entertained and paid from the Municipal Funds. These men vaccinated 3181 persons, of which 2965 were successful. And 144 persons were vaccinated by the Provincial Vaccinators, of which 1313 were successful. Thus a total of 4622 persons were vaccinated in this city. This is a striking contrast to the work done in Lahore and Umritsur where only 1314 and 877 persons respectively were vac- cinated. It shows what can be done when the municipalities realize the importance of vaccination. I trust that a letter of thanks may be addressed to the Munici- pal Commissioners for the cordial support they have given. Inspection of work at Delhi. In January I visited Delhi and attended a meeting of the Mu- nicipality, at this meeting the native members proposed that the Bhagats or priests of Seetla should be persuaded by a pecuniary offer to aid the vaccination, or at least to cease being at enmity with it, as the Native members considered they were the great obstructors to the progress of vaccination in the city, as they make a pecuniary profit from cases of small pox, by performing religious rites over them. City divided into four portions under the management of the members of the Mu- nicipality. This proving unsuccessful, the members agreed to divide the city into four parts, each division being placed under the charge and superintendence of two members who assisted together. Great success attend- ing this plan. This plan answered admirably and upwards of 2000 children were vaccinated in the month of February. Deaths from Small Pox. There have been 36 Deaths from Small Pox in the city during the year 1870. Goojranwalla.[ 13 ] Deaths from small pox. 504 deaths from small pox occurred in this district. Dr. Bennett inspected the work of these Vaccinators in March. Number vaccinated in the Jullundur dis- trict. Jullundur.on the first occasion and though less this year in the Jugraon and Sumrala sub-divisions of the district, the same difficulty and pas- sive resistance was experienced in the Loodiana sub-division. The other two districts have not yet been visited by the Pro- vincial Establishment. Districts having a small mortality from small pox. The districts that are remarkable for a small mortality are Simla, only 5 deaths, and this is the largest number that has occurred for the last four years. This I think must be attributed to two causes, 1st vaccination is carried on every year in this dis- trict and secondly the people are fully alive to the contagious nature of the disease and carry out as far as is possible a species of qua- rantine among themselves. Dera Ghazee Khan only 27 deaths (return for May not pub- lished) This district in previous years has had a small mortality from small pox. Kangra has only 66 deaths in spite of inoculation being practised in one part of this district. Of the total deaths from small pox (26579) only 578 were in (persons) above ten years of age. The mortality began gradually to increase during the months of March and April, rising to 4224, the maximum number of deaths in May, and gradually decreasing to 381 deaths in October. Special measures ne- cessary to check the spread of small pox in the Punjab. 40. I would strongly urge the necessity of some special measures being adopted to check the spread of small pox. If in each district the first case (not the first death) as soon as it could be known, were to be at once reported to the civil authorities and measures were immediately taken to put that house in quarantine, and vacci- nate all the unprotected in the affected house, village and neigh- bourhood, the disease would in most instances be prevented from spreading and much misery prevented. Compulsory vaccina- tion necessary for the large Towns. In the large towns of Lahore, Umritsur and Delhi, I think the time has arrived for compulsory vaccination. The rules might be framed and carried out by the Municipalities, they should be lax at first, and the limit of age to which the children should be per- mitted to remain unprotected should be six months, except in the case of small pox occurring in the town. Nothing but this will ever convince the Natives of the power of vaccination to render small pox inocuous. Inoculation in the Punjab. 41. I fear inoculation is still carried on in many parts of the Punjab. I have lately received reports of its being practised ex- tensively in the Shahpore district, also in the Kangra and in the Attock sub-division of the Rawul Pindee district. Inoculation of Hei- fers at the Hissar Cattle Farm. 42. I regret to have to report that the Medical Officer at Hissar has again been unsuccessful in his attempts to inoculate the Heifers. Mr. Cooper attributes the failure to the want of proper shelter from the cold, he is sanguine that eventually he will suc- ceed although he has failed again this year. Dr. Seaton says that &quot;The production of vaccine in the cow by small pox inoculation is a matter of very considerable difficulty, for one case in which the inoculation succeeds, it will fail in at least a dozen.&quot; As it is impossible to overrate the advantages to be gained by having an annual supply of pure lymph not only plentiful in quan- tity but of which there can be no doubt as to its purity, I think it desirable to continue the experiments. I purpose also applying to Dr. Blance of the Bombay Vaccine
[ 15 ] Department for some lymph taken direct from the cow, which is not attended with the same difficulty in propagation. Vaccine lymph from England. 43. Supplies of vacccine in capillary tubes and on ivory points were received from England at the commencement of the cold sea- son, some of these were used by me and some by Dr. Benett with success. Some were sent to Medical Officers in charge of Regi- ments. Distribution of vac- cine lymph to the Civil Surgeons and Regimental Medical Officers in the Pun- jab. 44. Supplies of vaccine lymph were distributed to the Civil Surgeons and Regimental Medical Officers, consisting of 282 tubes, 288 crusts, 154 ivory points and 22 glasses. Dispensary Vaccination. Dispensary Estab- lishment. Twenty-six districts of the Punjab have 54 Vaccinators at- tached to the Dispensaries and paid from Imperial Funds. Two to each Dispensary at Head Quarters (one on Rs. 10, the other on 8 per mensem) and one vaccinator at a few Branch Dispensaries. Number vaccinated. They have vaccinated 61,600, being a decrease on the work per- formed in 1869 of 12,039. The average number of persons vaccinated by each Vaccinator is 1100. The percentage of success in primary vaccinations is 81.03 and in secondary vaccinations 75.88 Sirsa district. The decrease is principally in the Sirsa district, in which there is a falling off to the extent of 14,217, no reason for this has been given. Hazara district. In the Hazara district there is a decrease of 4240. The Vac- cinators were working with the Provincial Establishment for about two months during the hot season in this district, and the work done by them during this period was included in the Provincial Returns, but this would not account for such a large falling off. Bunnu district. In Bunnu there is a decrease of 804, no cause has been given. Ferozpur district. Reasons given by the Civil Surgeons. In Ferozpoor there is a decrease of 474. The Civil Surgeon Dr. Williams reports that this is owing to &quot;No assistance whatever&quot; &quot;from the Civil authorities being given, and the people are averse&quot; &quot;to the operation generally and fully comprehend that they can&quot; &quot;do as they please, and until the subject is taken up by the Civil&quot; &quot;powers, small pox will continue to decimate whole villages in its&quot; &quot;periodical visitations.&quot; He also says &quot;the low percentage of&quot; &quot;success (59.58) is in a great measure accounted for by the fact&quot; &quot;of crusts only having been used, as objections are raised to arm to arm&quot; &quot;vaccination, as also to the taking of lymph from successful cases.&quot; Remarks by the De- puty Commissioner. The Deputy Commissioner remarks in a letter in reply to the Civil Surgeon, that in his late tour in the district it appeared to him that the people had lost confidence in the treatment on ac- count of the want of success that had resulted, and that under these circumstances he would be reluctant to give the assistance asked for by the vaccinators, and some special action should be taken to ensure a more successful result, as the disease (small pox) has committed great havoc in the district. I have quoted the above as I believe it equally applies to the majority of the districts to which dispensary vaccinators are at- tached. I have seen many instances during the three years I have been in this Department, of the injury to the cause of vaccination,
[ 16 ] done by vaccinating with crusts, the percentage of success under these circumstances cannot be much above 50. Importance of vacci- nating from &quot;Arm to Arm&quot; or with lymph. I think this of such importance that I would remove vaccina- tors from such districts in which vaccination cannot be carried on from &quot;arm to arm&quot; or at least by lymph, as I am convinced it does more harm than good, as the people have good reason to complain of the non-protection afforded by such vaccination, and the people have strong objections to having their children vaccinated a second or perhaps a third time, even when they would not object to once. And when it is understood that the generality of the people have no idea that protection is only afforded when the operation is suc- cessful, and even have no idea when it is successful or not, but simply think that the fact of inserting the lymph under the skin, is all sufficient to protect them from small pox, the loss of faith in the operation, by the parent whose children are attacked with small pox is communicated to all around and the injury to the cause of vacci- nation is far greater than might be supposed. Jhung district At Jhung there is a decrease of 150, although the work of two extra vaccinators has been included. In 1869 there was also a fall- ing off in this district, as compared with the year previous. No explanation has been given by the Civil Surgeon. Small pox was very prevalent in this district, 1489 deaths took place in 1869, of which 67 were above 10 years of age. Kohat district. Reason for decrease given by the Civil Surgeon. In Kohat there is a falling off of 280, only 145 persons having been vaccinated during the year. The Civil Surgeon states that vaccination was not performed during the months of February and March, owing to great prevalence of Fever and Pneumonia which proved very fatal. The Afreedees sent down an application, to have some one sent with medicine for their relief; the vaccinators were used for dispensing medicines, and the Afreedees showed their appre- ciation of the measure by sending down the Mallick a second time, to beg that the vaccinators might be allowed to stay a considerable time longer, as they were doing a great deal of good. Deaths from small pox. There is comparatively very little small pox in this district. In 1870 there were 89 deaths, of which 12 were above ten years of age. Rohtuk district. In Rohtuk there is a decrease of 239, but there was a large in- crease in 1869, of 4454 on the year previous. District in which there has been an increase on the pre- vious year. In sixteen districts there has been an increase[ 17 ] Percentage in Seal- kote suspiciously high. On the other hand, in Sealkote the percentage of success is sus- piciously high, 99.25. With the greatest care both in the selection of the lymph and the children to be operated on, and vaccinating solely from &quot;arm to arm,&quot; I have scarcely been able to obtain a percentage so high as this, and when vaccinating a large number of children as in this district (4476) I believe it to be impossible. Re-vaccination. With regard to re-vaccinations, it is probable that the meaning has been misunderstood in some districts in spite of the foot-note explaining this. For in Mooltan the percentage of success in re-vaccinations is 93.75 in the city, and 100 in the suburbs. In Montgomery it is 100 per cent. In Rajanpore it is 86.95 and in Jhelum it is 84.31. Municipal Vaccination. Municipal Establish- ment. Eleven Vaccinators have been employed by the undermen- tioned Municipalities and paid Rupees 654-12-8. Number vaccinated. They have vaccinated 9478 persons with a percentage of suc- cess of 79.90, and at a cost of one anna five and a half-pies. Dehli.[ 18 ] Hakeems of Bhawul- pore employed in vaccinating. In this state the Hakeems were employed in vaccination and vaccinated 2968 persons with a percentage of success of 66.71. Mundi. I have not heard whether the vaccinator entertained by this State in 1869 has been employed during the present year. The operations performed by these locally entertained vacci- nators is shown in statement No. VI. Conduct of Establish- ment. The establishment has behaved well on the whole, in one or two instances carelessness has been detected, and one or two Native Superintendents appear to have been lazy, but no serious fault has occurred during the year, and no complaints have been received. Numerical Returns. The numerical Returns prescribed by Government are appended to which I have added, Statement No. VI, shewing the particulars of vaccination performed by Municipal and other vaccinators, No. VII showing the total of all vaccine operations in the Punjab, and No. VIII showing the deaths from small pox in each district during each month of the year 1870. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, ISAAC NEWTON, Offg. Superintendent General, Vaccination,
[ 19 ] From J. BENNETT, ESQ., M. D., Officiating Superintendent of Vaccination, Punjab. To ISAAC NEWTON, ESQ., M. D., Officiating Superintendent General of Vaccination, Punjab. SIR, I have the honor to submit a Report on the Vaccine Operations per- formed by the Establishment under my charge, during the past five months of the season 1870-71. Took over charge. 2. I took over charge of the Establishment at Rawul Pindee on the 13th October 1870, and immediately afterwards proceeded to Lahore, where arrangements had been made by Dr. Garden for the work of the Superin- tendent to commence. Establishment. 3. The establishment under my supervision consisted of the follow- ing :[ 20 ] Number of operations performed in the City. The number of operations during the 4½ months vaccination was carried on, amounted to 1314, which although shewing an increase over the numbers done in any previous year, is yet but a mere fraction, considering the size and population of the place. Taking the population of the city at 85,300, (census 1868) and the estimated annual number of births at one-thirtieth of this number, it is found that about 2,800 children under 1 year of age ought to be vaccinated yearly, not taking into account the large number over that age, that have been accumulating for several years, and remaining unprotected either by vaccination or a previous attack of small pox. The number of children vaccinated under one year was 587, being about one-fifth of the annual birth rate as above calculated. Little or no assis- tance given by the Municipal Commit- tee. As in former years but little efficient assistance was given by the Members of the Municipal Committee. The subject of vaccination was, I believe, on several occasions brought before them in Committee, but with the exception of Nawab Abdul Majid Khan, Honorary Magistrate, none of them appear to have done any thing beyond giving vague promises of assistance, that were never fulfilled. The opposition of the city people is so great, that, it seems a mere waste of time and money, to send Vaccina- tors among them unaided; to do any good the Vaccinators ought always to be accompanied by some influential and intelligent Native to overcome the prejudices of the people, and to encourage them to bring their children to be vaccinated. If the Members of the Municipal Committee, each in his turn, would make it part of their duty to do this, it would in course of time have an excellent effect, and be the means of saving a great many lives that are lost yearly by so preventible a disease as small pox. Deaths from small pox in the City. In the year 1869, the number of deaths in the city from small pox alone was 425, being double the number of deaths caused in the same year by cholera, and nearly one-eighth of the whole mortality arising from all causes put together. A glance at the following figures taken from the Sanitary Commissioner's Report for 1869, will shew this :[ 21 ] to understand and appreciate. On the whole I consider this Tehseel to be very fairly protected from small pox. Number vaccinated in Chunian sub- division. Number vaccinated in the Town of Chu- nian. 10. Chunian Tehseel. On the 23rd January I passed over from Shurruckpore to the Chunian district, where the greater portion of the establishment had been at work for several days. This Tehseel contains a population of 167,457. (Tehseeldar's Return); and the total number of vaccinations was 7272, of which about 96 per cent were successful. In the town of Chunian containing a population of 7355 (census 1868) 250 vaccinations were performed, of which 97 were under one year of age, being about one-third of the estimated birth rate for the year. Inadequate assistance rendered by the members of the Municipality. The Members of the Municipal Committee accompanied the Vaccina- tors at their work, and going round from house to house, appeared to be giving very good assistance indeed. The children (chiefly Musalmans) were brought in considerable numbers, and every thing seemed to be going on most satisfactorily until the Hindoo portion of the city was reached, when a change was at once observed. The energies of the Committee began to flag and the number of children very sensibly diminished. When this fact was pointed out to them, they again bestirred, themselves, but as there was no corresponding increase in the number of children brought, it became very evident that their exertions were more apparent than real; and but comparatively few of the more respectable classes of Hindoos brought their children forward to be vaccinated. Apathy and indiffe- rence shown by Teh- seeldar Jaggat Ka- shore. The Tehseeldar, Jaggat Kashore, shewed much apathy and indifference and gave but little assistance to the Vaccinators, while operations were being carried on in the Town. Decrease in the num- bers vaccinated ow- ing to opposition of Lumberdars of some of the larger Vil- lages. This Tehseel with a population of 48000 more than that of Shur- ruckpore, shews a decrease of 403 vaccinations from the number done in that district; and this falling off is to be attributed chiefly to the opposition displayed by the Lumberdars of some of the larger villages. For example, in Khoodean, a village of considerable importance, containing about 700 houses and over 3,000 of a population, only 44 vaccinations were inspected. The instances however in which this opposition could not in part be overcome, were not very numerous, and the progress of the work through- out the Tehseel generally was on the whole not altogether unsatisfactory. 11. Kasur Tehseel. On the 23rd February I passed over to the Tehseel of Kasur, where a marked improvement in the attitude of the people towards vaccination was at once observed. In the course of the first day's inspection, I passed through a Zail, in which, in the space of two days, over 1,000 operations had been performed by four men alone. Number vaccinated in the Kasur Teh- seel. This Tehseel contains a population of 197,667, and the total number of vaccinations was 7,985, of which about 97 per cent were successful. Number vaccinated in the Town of Kasur. Town of Kasur.[ 22 ] Evidence of frequent epidemics of small pox were visible in this Town. Vaccination has not been conducted here for the last six years, and epidemics of small pox, during that period, have been of frequent occurrence. Ample evidence of this was observed in the large number of children seen, who were marked and maimed with this disease. A mild epidemic of small pox was going on at the time the vaccinators were at work here, but a large number of children having been rapidly brought under the influence of vac- cination, the disease was not allowed to spread to any considerable extent. Assistance rendered by the Municipal Committee. The members of the Municipal Committee were very active and gave the vaccinators excellent assistance. Operations conducted with much difficulty in the Town of Patti. Patti.[ 23 ] Idleness of Native Superintendent. At first he was evidently at a loss to know where his men were work- ing, and we had some difficulty in finding out a village, in which vaccina- tion had been carried on. I saw 21 cases all of which were successful, and of excellent quality. Although these cases had been operated on 14 days previously, it appeared from inquiries I made, that he had never been to inspect them; and his ignorance of the localities in which the vaccinators were working, proving him guilty of idleness, he was fined, and warned that, unless he gave more satisfactory evidence of work in future, he would lose his appointment. This man formerly bore an excellent character for work, but without proper supervision he seems to have become careless and indolent. The people of this district appeared to me favourably disposed towards vaccination. Inspection of work in the Pathan-kote Tehseel of the Goor- daspore district. 14. I arrived at Pathan Kote, en route to Noorpore, on the 23rd March, and inspected the work done there by the Native Superintendent, who had been working in this Tehseel during the whole of the cold season A considerable number of children with fresh looking vaccine cicatrices were seen, and the work on the whole appeared satisfactory. The Tehseel- dar was reported to have given good assistance. Operations in the Noorpore Tehseel of Kangra District. 15. Noorpore. Arriving at Noorpore on the evening of the 23rd March, I found the vaccinators, that had been sent on a head from Kasur, had started fresh vesicles, but not receiving much assistance, they were making but little progress. Without much difficulty, I prevailed on the members of the Municipal Committee to lend a helping hand, and accom- panied by the Tehseeldar and Naib Tehseeldar, they went about the town with the vaccinator, and gave them very fair assistance. Assistance given by Mahommad Azim Khan. The Naib Tehseeldar, Mahommed Azim Khan, shewed the most ener- gy and brought the largest number of children to be vaccinated. Small Pox prevailing slightly at the time Vaccination was be- ing conducted. At the time vaccination was being carried on here, a few sporadic cases of small pox occurred, but, as at Khem Kharn, a large number of children having been quickly brought under the influence of vaccination, the disease did not assume an epidemic form. One case fell under notice, in which vaccination and small pox were seen going on together. The cow pox vesicles, which were quite distinct and typical, did not seem to have exer- cised any modifying influence on the course of the small pox, as the symp- toms of the latter had set in on the 4th day after vaccination and consequent- ly before the protective stage had been reached. Luckily the case was not a severe one and I have no doubt the child ultimately recovered. Number vaccinated in the Town of Noorpore.

Read( 2 ) cannot be expected to advance. The Lieutenant-Governor is aware that the funds of Amritsar are not in a position to enable them to meet any large outlay in extending the operations; but, considering the importance of the subject and the great virulence with which small-pox has raged in the city of Amritsar, it would appear no more than a wise precaution for the Municipality to devote some portion of their funds to supplement the efforts of the vaccinating staff. 10. The Lieutenant-Governor observes that, though the mortality from small-pox is little more than half of what it was during the preceding year, yet that it is still exceedingly high,A VACCINE DEPARTMENT.

REPORT ON VACCINE OPERATIONS IN THE PANJAB, DURING THE SEASON 1871-72. BY SURGEON ISAAC NEWTON, M. R. C. S., LONDON, Officiating Superintendent- General of Vaccination for the Panjáb. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] LAHORE: PRINTED AT THE CENTRAL JAIL PRESS. 1872.
FROM ISAAC NEWTON, ESQUIRE, OFFG. SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL OF VACCINATION, PANJAB, To LEPEL H. GRIFFIN, ESQUIRE, OFFG. SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, PANJAB AND ITS DEPENDENCIES. SIR, I have the honor to submit, for the information of His Honor the Lieutenant Governor, my Report on Vaccine Operations in the Panjáb, during the year 1871-72. Total of all Vaccino operations. 2. The total number of vaccine operations performed in the Panjáb, by all establishments, is 281,519, being an increase of 60,070 on the work of the previous year. The total successful cases is 246,677, showing an increase of 53,988 on last year. The percentage of success in primary vaccinations is 87.16 against 85.03 last year ; and in second- ary or revaccinations, 60.40 as compared with 59.88 last year. The average number of persons vaccinated by each operator is 1,002.28. The operators include Hakíms and Native Superintendents. The cost of each successful case is 2 annas 4 pies, showing a considerable reduction on last year, when it was 4 annas and a fraction over 4 pies. The total number of persons vaccinated is in the ratio of 1.60 per cent. of the total population, and the total number of success- ful operations is at the rate of 47 per cent. of the estimated annual birth rate for the Panjáb, taken at 3 per cent. Satis- factory as this may be, there is yet a little more than half of the estimated number of births, or, in round numbers, 280,000 children left annually to be protected, or die from small-pox. Reliability of Vaccina- tors' returns. 3. His Honor the Lieutenant Governor, in his review of last year's report, observing on the non-reliability of statis- tics furnished by vaccinators, stated that returns should be checked by superintending officers as carefully as possible. I have therefore paid particular attention to this part of my duties. All the native superintendents and vaccinators have been warned, over and over again, that they will be dismissed if found out submitting an untruthful return, and that numbers was a secondary matter in importance, to truthful returns and quality of work. Introduction of Village Registers. With this object I introduced &quot; village registers &quot; at the beginning of this cold season, which received the approval of His Honor the Lieutenant Governor. Previously, one regis- ter, containing the names of all persons vaccinated in a parganah or subdivision of a district performed by each vaccinator, was forwarded, on completion of work, to the tahsíl. It was found impossible to use these in checking the returns of vaccinators; I therefore substituted village registers,
[ 2 ] viz., a separate register of each village vaccinated, to be signed by the lambardár or head man of the village, and by the native superintendent who inspected the work, and then sent to the Superintendent General's office for. examination. When all the village registers of a mortuary registration circle are complete, they are forwarded to the thánadár, who might, during epidemics of small-pox, refer to these registers, and compare the names of those who have died from small-pox, with those entered in the register as successfully vaccinated ; this could be made a complete check on the vaccinators, and would also constantly bring before the people the connection between vaccination and small-pox. That part of the provincial establishment which worked under the immediate superintendence of myself and Doctor Bennett have been closely watched, and a very considerable part of their work inspected, and I think their returns may be safely received as fairly correct. The following is the result of some of the work seen and examined by myself of which I took notes in order to compare with the returns. Of 128 villages and 4 towns taken indiscriminately, the registers gave 4,164 as having been vaccinated; of this number I could only succeed in examining 3,089. In towns where this difference has principally arisen, I found it quite impossible to examine all the children vaccinated without giving up a considerable amount of time which I had not to spare. Where any difference occurred in a village it was always satisfactorily accounted for by the lambardár. Of the number examined, 2,891 were successful, 12 were unsuccessful, 73 were doubtful, i.e., the vesicles were not of the true Jennerian type, and 113 were revaccinations. This gives a percentage of success of 97.14 (excluding revaccinations which were all of a doubtful nature), which will bear comparison with that given in the returns. As regards dispensary vaccination returns, I wrote to Civil Surgeons having dispensary vaccinators under them regarding the means they have of testing their vaccinators' returns. The purport of their replies is given under dispen- sary vaccination of each district. Some are unsatisfactory ; but the duties of Civil Surgeons, as a rule, prevent their having time for looking after the vaccinators, except now and then in the town at their head-quarters. If they were to use the village registers, the returns could be very easily checked. Provincial Establish- ment. 4. The establishment of the Panjáb Vaccine Depart- ment during the season of 1871-72, consisted as follows :[ 3 ] States of Chamba, Keonthal, Jabbal, Bhagal, Bajji, Mailog, Kuniah, and a large portion of the hilly tract of the Patiálah State. Number of persons vac cinated. 6. The total number of persons vaccinated during the year by the provincial establishment is 196,435, being an increase of 55,211 on last year's work. The total number of successful cases is 183,050, being an increase on last year of 51,822. The percentage of success is 98.00 as compared with 97.10 last year. The average number of operations performed by each vaccinator is 1,413.20. The cost of each successful case is 4 annas 3.33 pies, being less by one anna 2.27 pies than last season. Commencement of work in the Hills. Keonthal State, Number vaccinated in Keonthal. 7. Having finished work in the Nalagarh State by the close of last season, I proceeded to Erki, where I had sent on vaccinators to start the work. On reaching there I found rejoicings going on owing to the birth of a son and heir ; and at the request of the Rána, who promised every assistance in October, I postponed operations and marched on to Simla, and addressed a letter to the Rájah of Keonthal asking him to allow vaccination to be performed in his State. He replied that vaccination might be performed in certain parganahs,[ 4 ] estimated population of 50,000[ 5 ] of vaccination even as compared with inoculation. It also, I think, shows that the protection becomes weak after many years, and the operation should be repeated after ten or twelve years. None of the younger people who had been vaccinated within the last 8 or 9 years took the disease. It also shows how easy it is to carry out quarantine where the people are made to understand the contagious nature of the disease. Small-pox in Simla. One or two cases of small-pox occurred in Simla; in one case, that of a jámpáni who had lately come from the Mandi State, and probably brought the disease with him. He was at once sent to the small-pox hospital, and, the disease being very mild, soon recovered. These instances shew the necessity for constant vigilance, and every effort being made to keep the mass of people who annually collect at Simla protected as far as possible. Vaccination of servants' children brought from the Plains. I therefore endeavoured to vaccinate the unprotected children of the servants who came up from the Plains. I applied to the Municipal Commissioners to grant a circular letter, that the native superintendent might show to the re- sidents and visitors, when going into their compounds, which they gave. I also gave the native superintendent a letter asking the people to use their influence in getting their ser- vants to have their children vaccinated ; this, I am happy to say, was attended with excellent results ; in almost every in- stance the native superintendent was received favourably and assistance given, and nearly every house was visited. Vaccination in Kasowli and neighbourhood. 11. During the rainy season, operations were carried on in Kasowli and neighbouring villages belonging to the Patiálah and Baghat States, and in the Koti State, which bounds Simla on the north-east. The people appreciate vaccination, and no difficulty was met with in this State ; 568 persons were vaccinated, of which 473 were successful and 27 revaccinations. Vaccinations inspected in Kasowli. Early in September, I inspected the work going on in Kasowli. I found the vaccinators had experienced a little difficulty, both in the bazar and in the Baghat State. Lawrence Military Asy- lum at Sanáwar. 12. With the kind permission of the Principal, the Revd. F. Cole, I examined the children of the Lawrence Military Asylum at Sanáwar, as to the amount of protection they had against an attack of small-pox. From the subjoined table it will be seen how lamentably insufficiently they are pro- tected; and, as might be expected, a large percentage are marked with small-pox, 5.51. Having no vaccine marks or cicatrices. Having one vaccine cicatrice. Having two vaccine cicatrices. Having three vac- cine cica- trices. Having four vaccine cicatrices.

[ 6 ] vaccine cicatrices, and of these 16 were very poor; 19 had no marks, and of these 6 were marked from small-pox. It will be seen that the same result has been found in the Sanáwar Asylum, and it is only fair to presume that this is the state of the children generally in the army. 151 children were vaccinated in this asylum, of which 54 proved successful in the primary vaccination, and 40 in revaccinations, or those who were badly marked. Vaccination in the Bághal State, 13. Having sent a staff of vaccinators early in October into the Bághal State, I followed during the middle of the month, and found the work progressing favourably; no trouble whatever was experienced. The Rána gave every assistance ; but I regret to say I could not persuade him to have his children nor those of his nephew vaccinated. In this State, having an estimated population of 22,000,[ 7 ] Manimájrah, is 6,699 ; of this number 6,144 were successful, and 389 were revaccinations. Ambálah parganah. 15. About the middle of November I sent two native superintendents and a staff of vaccinators on to Ambálah to commence the work in that parganah, hoping they would get a considerable . amount of work performed by the time I arrived there. On the contrary, I found they had done little or nothing by the end of November. Thinking they had been idle, I went with them to several villages, for several days together, but with no result; all within a radius of 6 or 7 miles of cantonments most obstinately refused to allow any vaccination, or only of the low caste. The tahsíldár was extremely indifferent and took no interest in the work, al- though the Deputy Commissioner, Captain Beadon, spoke to him about giving assistance on several occasions. The consequence was much time was spent over this parganah, it not being finished until 15th January, part of the establish- ment having been working in it for two months, and the others six weeks. This lack of success was partly, no doubt, due to my having to leave them in order to visit and inspect other districts. I went into the town of Ambálah on several days, and met with very fair success. Extra Assistant Commissioner Gopál Sahai rendered me every assistance, using his influence with his friends, and I vaccinated his own child and several children of the wealthier classes who met at his house for the purpose. The population is 24,040, and 435 persons were vaccinated, of which 406 were successful and 18 revaccinations. This is very much better than has ever been done before, being the first time the wealthier people would allow their children to be vaccinated. Number vaccinated in the Ambálah parga- nah. The total number vaccinated in the parganah was 3,725, which, considering the population, 177,081, is very small; if assistance had been given, twice this number might have been performed ; of this number 3,563 were successful, and 45 revaccinations. There are 304 villages in this parganah, which have all been visited. Small-pox in a village near Ambálah can- tonments. In a small village about 3½ miles from cantonments, small-pox broke out previous to the vaccinator's visit; five children who had not been vaccinated took the disease, and one died ; these were all children of low caste parents, and were not allowed to mix with the rest of the villagers ; 13 children were vaccinated and no more cases occurred. This is an instance of how easily the disease may be prevented from spreading by a little care. Vaccination in Piplí par- ganah. 16. Work was commenced in the Píplí parganah about the middle of December and completed about the third week in January. Every assistance was rendered, and the work went on very satisfactorily. The population of this parganah is 221,419, and contains 527 villages, which were all visited. The total number of persons vaccinated in this parganah, excluding the towns of Sháhbád and Thánesar, is 7,709, of which 7,183 were successful and 181 revaccinations.
[ 8 ] Town of Sháhábád. In the town of Sháhábád, the population of which is 11,678, the total number vaccinated is 349, of which 330 were successful. In this town I examined 107 children, and found 103 successful. Town of Thánesar. In the town of Thánesar, having a population of 7,929, only 141 were vaccinated, of which 129 were successful and 7 revac- cinations. In this town I examined 126 children, of whom I found 120 had been successfully vaccinated and 6 were doubtful. In the town of Ládwah, the population of which is nearly 5,000[ 9 ] The number of persons vaccinated in this parganah is 7,949, excluding the towns; of this number 7,654 were suc- cessful and 108 were revaccinations. Town of Sádhaurah. In the town of Sádhaurah the population is 11,198, and the number vaccinated 441; of this number 433 were success- ful. This success was due to the excellent arrangements made by tahsíldár Nand Lall, who accompanied me to the town. Town of Sháhzfídpúr. In the town of Sháhzádpúr, having a population of about 2,000, the number vaccinated is 150; of this number I examined 113 and found 107 successful and 3 revaccinations. In this town it is probable a large mortality was arrested, as two deaths from small-pox had lately taken place, and one child was suffering from the disease at the time vaccination was com- menced. The people were warned against allowing their children to go near the contagious house, and the lambardárs were told not to allow the sick child to leave its house until quite well. This and the vaccination, I believe, prevented any more cases occurring. In the large village of Panjlassa, close to Naráingarh, the residents of which are Rájpúts, the lambardár informed me that they had never allowed any vaccination to be performed in their village, except a few of the sweepers' children, but, owing to my having come, they would all be done; 120 children were vaccinated, nearly all Rájpúts. I examined 55 of these; 51 were successful and 4 doubtful. Town of Raipúr. In the town of Raipúr, having a population of about 4,000, the number vaccinated was 225, and I examined 195 of these, and found 177 successful and 6 revaccinations ; assistance was rendered in this town by Honorary Magistrate, Ráo Kishn Singh, to whom this success was due. I was informed that a baniah residing here had sent to Ambálah for his child, a distance of 25 miles, in order to have it vaccinated. In the evening, after my inspection of the town, amongst a number of sick persons who came for treatment, was a re- spectable baniah, who said his daughter aged 13 years was suffering from small-pox, having been vaccinated twice and once inoculated. I therefore went to see her, and found her suffering from a mild attack of modified small-pox, and no mark whatever of having been successfully vaccinated. It is probable she had been inoculatd, though I could not be sure from examining the wrist. It is gratifying to be able to give even one instance of ignorance and prejudice giving way. It is a rare thing for a Hindú, more especially a baniah, the most prejudiced of all natives, to ask any one to prescribe for small- pox except by charms and &quot;pújas.&quot; This is the second case I have been called to prescribe for, during this year, both of which were voluntarily brought to my notice by the parents. Completion of work in the Ambálah district. 19. This completed the work in the Ambálah district, the Rúpar parganah having been visited by the provincial establishment towards the close of last season. Total vaccinated in the- Ambalah district. The total number of persons vaccinated in this district is 35,438, of which 33,434 were successful or 98.28 per cent. and 880 were revaccinations, of which 372 were successful or 43.86 per cent. Estimating the annual birth rate at 36,349 (one
[ 10 ] thirtieth of the population), the total number of successful oper- ations is at the rate of 93 per cent. This district extends over an area of 2,628 square miles, and contains 1,935 villages (ex- cluding those of the Rúpar parganah), all of which have been visited by a staff of 9 native superintendents and 41 vaccina-- tors. The average number of persons vaccinated by each vaccinator is 841. The total number of deaths from small-pox in this district was 1,490 during 1871, of which number 1,229 occurred in rural circles, and 261 in the towns. Distribution of estab- lishment. 20. On completion of vaccination in the Ambálah district, I sent one native superintendent and his vaccinators to the Pinjaur parganah of the Patiálah State ; one native superintendent and his vaccinators to the Haripúr parganah of the same State ; two native superintendents and their vacci- nators to the Mailog State ; two native superintendents and vaccinators to the Bajji State, and the same to the Sukét State, and one native superintendent and his vaccinators to Kuniah State. Pinjaur parganah, Patiá- lah State. On my arrival at Pinjaur I found the work had been started. Every assistance was rendered by the Maharàja's servants and not an objection raised by the people. The total number vaccinated is 1,480 ; of this number 1,273 were successful, and 159 were revaccinations. Mailog State. After seeing the work well advancd in the Pinjaur par- ganah, I proceeded to Mailog and inspected both native super- intendents' work, which I found very satisfactory. The Rána had given every assistance, and 1,326 persons were vaccinated, of which 1,206 were successful, and 81 revaccinations. Kuniah State. I next visited the Kuniah State, where 149 were vaccina- ted, 130 of which were successful; the whole of these were examined by me. Bajji State. I next visited the Bajji State, where I found the work proceeding very satisfactorily. Sukét State. The Rajah of Sukét had refused to allow vaccination on account of a famine in his State. Districts in which na- tive superintendents and vaccinators have worked. 21. Vaccine operations have also been carried on in the following districts by the provincial establishment:[ 11 ] to deal with, and little or no assistance was being given. I compared his village registers with the children vaccinated in three villages and found them truthfully prepared. AMRITSAR.[ 12 ] pletely wasted for about five weeks, only vaccinating 25 children ; owing to the tahsíldár having received the parwána mentioned above. It is probable the tahsíldár misunderstood the parwána, thinking he was to stand aloof from the work and withdraw all his influence and efforts of persuasion. LUDIANAH. One native superintendent and six vaccina- tors worked in the Ludiánah parganah during the whole season, vaccinating 7,769 persons, with a percentage of success of 99.33. The work has gone on most satisfactorily this year in this parganah. Tahsíldár Rádhakishen took considerable interest in the work; the result has shown that vaccination can succeed in this district when it receives that attention from the Civil Authorities that the importance of the work deserves. In the town of Ludiánah 1,082 persons have been vacci- nated, 1,057 being successful. Last year a large staff of vaccinators only succeeded in vaccinating 3,724 in this par- ganah and 1,077 in the town. The hope I expressed in last year's report, that the prejudices to vaccination of the people of this town, which had previously been so strong, were giving way, seems to be partially fulfilled, and now that about 3,000 children have been successfully vaccinated during three suc- cessive winters, the town should be tolerably protected, and the fact that only one death from small-pox occurred in this town during the year 1871, and only 26 throughout the remainder of the district, would seem to show that it is protected. On 12th and 13th December I inspected the work in this district. Selecting three village registers, I went out to the villages and compared the children vaccinated, and found the returns correct and the character of the vesicles fair. JALANDHAR. One native superintendent and four vaccina- tors worked during this year in the Phillour and Nakodar parganahs, and vaccinated 12,642 persons, with a percentage of success of 99.64. Last year the work in this district was not satisfactory ; I therefore changed the native superin- tendent, putting one of my best men in his place, which has attended with good results. On 14th December I inspected the work in the Phillour parganah. I examined 100 children and compared them with the register, which I found correct and the vaccine cicatrices very fair. I also examined a few children in the town of Phillour, with the same result; only 14 deaths from small-pox occurred in the town of Jálandhar, and 98 in rural circles. HOSHIARPUR. One native superintendent and five vac- cinators worked in the Hoshiárpúr and U'nah parganahs, and vaccinated 5,840 persons, with a percentage of success of 95. On the 4th and 5th January I inspected the vaccination in the Hoshiárpúr parganah. I selected seven village registers and proceeded to these villages; the registers gave 168 names as vaccinated ; I examined 153 and compared them with the registers and found them truthfully prepared; 147 were success- ful, and four revaccinations ; about 80 per cent. had six vesicles and the remainder not less than four, of those entered as successful.
[ 13 ] In the town of Hoshiárpúr 257 persons were vaccinated, of which 230 were successful. On my visit I examined 50 children lately vaccinated, and 56 others were vaccinated in my presence. Naib Tahsíldár Muhammad Azím Khán took great interest in the work, frequently accompanying the vac- cinators into the town, spending money on sweetmeats for the children to be vaccinated, and doing all he could to persuade the parents to have their children vaccinated. This is the same man who gave Doctor Bennett good assistance in the Núrpúr parganah last year. GURDASPUR.[ 14 ] power. The number vaccinated in this town is 590; the percentage of success being 98.16. SIALKOT.[ 15 ] In the town of Ráwalpindi, having a population of 19,228, 424 children were successfully vaccinated by the provincial vaccinators ; this together with the number (979) successfully vaccinated by the municipal vaccinators, gives 1,403 successful operations in this town. Small-pox was epidemic in the town all through the cold season. The number of deaths in 1871 was 114, and throughout the district there were 1,382 deaths. For the last three years there has been a very small mortality from small-pox in this district, i.e., since it was visited by the provincial establish- ment during the cold season of 1867-68, when the mortality fell from 1,617 during 1867, to 165 in 1868 ; and 36 during 1869. Small-pox in a village near the city caused by inoculation. On the 23rd December I inspected the work in this district, and compared it with the registers, which I found correct, and the quality of the work good. In one village I visited about two miles from the city, I found on enquiry that small-pox had broken out in October, and was prevalent in the village at the time of vaccination (18th and 24th November). I was informed that a Moulavi inoculator came to the village in October, and inoculated at least one child, which was no doubt the first cause of small-pox in this village ; 29 children were vaccinated, three of whom took small-pox a few days after, two slightly and one rather severely, but all recovered. It appeared that small-pox first broke out in this village ; from this it extended to the town of Ráwalpindi and then to cantonments. Thus from one inoculation how many lives were sacrificed ! From one man's act, hundreds of lives were lost, and untold suffering the result. I am glad to say this inoculator has been warned by the Civil Authorities. DISPENSARY VACCINATION. 22. During the year under report the districts under the Dispensary system of vaccination have been reduced from 22 to 18, and the number of Dispensary vaccinators from 54 to 46, two vaccinators having been withdrawn from each of the districts of Siálkót, Gujránwála, Gurdáspúr and Ludiánah, and incorporated in the provincial establishment. An addi- tional vaccinator has been sanctioned and appointed for Jhang, which only had one vaccinator last year. Number vaccinated by Dispensary establish- ment. The total number vaccinated by this establishment is 54,596, being an increase on last year of 514 (excluding the work of those vaccinators withdrawn since last year). The percentage of success is 84.99 in primary vaccina- tion, being an improvement on 1870-71, when it was 81.03. In revaccination it is 72.75 as compared with 75.88 for 1870-71. The average number performed by each vaccinator is 1,213.24, being an increase of 113.24 on last year ; but this is hardly correct, as the work performed by other operators than dispensary vaccinators has been included ; owing to Ci- vil Surgeons not keeping the records separately. The cost of dispensary vaccination (not including travel- ling allowance Civil Surgeons may have received) is Rs.4,976; the cost of each successful case being anna one and ten pies.
[ 16 ] GURGAON.[ 17 ] There is a considerable improvement in the percentage of'success from 59.58 last year to 84.43 this year, owing to arm-to-arm vaccination having this year only been performed; much credit is due to Dr. Williams, who has taken consider- able interest in the vaccination, for discarding the use of crusts under difficulties ; the people being generally averse to vacci- nation. Assistance has also been rendered this year by the Deputy Commissioner. The vaccinators' registers are sent to the tahsíldár, who sends them to the lambardárs to be tested as to their correctness ; but the Civil Surgeon con- siders this no real check. MONTGOMERY.[ 18 ] a second vaccinator has now been sanctioned. The average number of vaccinations performed by each vaccinator is 528. After the vaccine disease had been established, operations were chiefly performed from arm-to-arm, and there is a considerable improvement in the percentage of success, from 68.77 last year, to 80.19 this year. Mr. Crossley, the Medical Officer, has the following mode of testing the vaccinators' returns, which appears a good plan. From the registers kept by each vaccinator, he selects every 5th name shown as successful, and examines each arm ; under this scrutiny he found only two cases unsuccessful which had been returned as successful, and these were satisfactorily explained by the vaccinators and parents. The Deputy Commissioner takes a warm interest in vac- cination ; and tahsíldár Thákúr Dás of Chiniót is brought specially to notice by Mr. Crossley, who says[ 19 ] Civil Surgeon or Sub-Assistant Surgeon, and satisfying themselves that the vesicles are of the true Jennerian type, and not less than four in number, should be allowed. SHAHPUR.[ 20 ] immediate supervision of the Civil Surgeon, and this I hope to give them during the next season.&quot; He further says the only means of testing the vaccinators' returns is by visiting the villages in which they have been working. No assistance is given by the Civil Authorities. KOHAT.[ 21 ] ing the vaccinators' returns whether they are truthful or not. Every assistance is rendered by the Civil Authorities. MUNICIPAL VACCINATION. Number of vaccinators entertained, and num- ber of operations. 23. Twenty-three vaccinators have been entertained by the undermentioned Municipalities during the present season, being an increase of 12 vaccinators on last year. All excepting at Dehli and Bhíwáni are entertained temporarily, some for the whole season, others for a less period. They have per- formed 11,241 operations, with a percentage of success of 86.42. The cost has been Rs. 1,186-6-0, being at the rate of 11.12 pies per successful vaccination. LAHORE.[ 22 ] number of children of the better classes, but entirely failed, all imaginable reasons being given but the right one. I inspected several children who had been vaccinated seven days ago, and I found the quality of the work good. The two members then proposed that if I would attend the general meeting on the 5th, they would make arrangements for vaccination in the town afterwards. This I did, but being a wet morning, the native members considered it would be use- less to attempt vaccination. I went alone into the poorest parts of the town, where a few children were vaccinated. AMRITSAR.[ 23 ] I believe on no previous occasion have so many been vacci- nated during one season. RAWALPINDI.[ 24 ] The operations performed by these vaccinators (excepting at Shujáhábád) have been included in the Dispensary returns. Thirty-one hakíms were employed in vaccination in the Jhelam district, and vaccinated 1,366 persons with a percent- age of success of 83.41. The Superintendent of Hakims reports that a great part of the cold season was taken up in teaching them, and that they have improved very much since the arrival of the pamphlet on vaccination, and that he hopes next season will show considerable progress both in number and quality. They receive no extra allowance for this duty. NATIVE STATES. 25. BHAWALPUR.[ 25 ] The following shows the number of deaths during each month of the year 1871, taken from the published returns of the Sanitary Commissioner :[ 26 ] disinfected, the spread of the disease would generally be prevented. If a general order were issued to all lambardárs or heads of villages, explaining the nature of the disease and holding them responsible that the affected person is not allowed to leave his house, and to warn the people in the village against going into the infected house, together with instructions for disinfecting the clothes &c., they would practically be carried out. 28. INOCULATION.[ 27 ] to the native superintendents who were working near Simla, to commence vaccination with; the vesicles produced from this were very small and inactive, but after one or two transmis- sions they very much improved, and, being perfect in character, the disease was propagated solely from these, and the old dis- carded ; it having been the custom each year to renew the lymph under the idea that it might deteriorate. The following supplies of vaccine lymph were distributed to Civil Surgeons and Regimental Medical Officers:[ 28 ] VIII.

[ 29 ] FROM JOHN BENNETT, ESQUIRE, M. D. OFFG. SUPERINTENDENT VACCINATION, PANJAB, TO ISAAC NEWTON, ESQUIRE, OFFG. SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL OF VACCINATION, PANJAB. SIR, I have the honor to submit the Annual Report of Vaccination for the year 1871-72. Establishment. 2. The establishment during the working season consisted of the following:[ 30 ] of people to deal with, he was unable to show me satisfactory evi- dence of a fair amount of work having been accomplished. His vaccinators too were indolent and careless; although natives of the district and comparatively well known to the people, they did not seem to have much influence with them. 4. About the middle of April I passed on to Pálampúr, and commenced operations at an altitude ranging from 3,000 to 4,500 feet. The opposition encountered here was even greater than that at first experienced at Kángra, and the people were so obstinate that it was found almost impracticable to do any work among them. The náib tahsíldár of Pálampúr gave the vaccinators every assistance, and endeavoured to make vaccination popular, but unsuccessfully; and excepting in a few places little or nothing was done. The tahsíl of Kángra, including the náib-tahsíldári of Pálampúr, contains a population of 187,446; and the number of vaccinations (excluding those done by the local native superintendent) was 2,456, of which 94.07 per cent. were successful. 5. CHAMBA.[ 31 ] rations carried on from that taken from Dalhousie. On the 9th Octo- ber I returned to Chúhárí to inspect the work now being carried on along the whole length of the valley, and found it progressing in the most favourable manner. This valley is one of the most fertile and well populated tracts of country in the Chamba Territory, and the people offering no resistance to the vaccinators, work was carried on to a larger extent, and with greater expedition, than in any other part of the State. Number vaccinated in the Chamba State. The total number of operations in the Chamba State was 4,032, of which 1,268, or nearly a third, were done in the Chúhárí valley and the hills near Dalhousie. Oporations in the Kán- gra and Núrpúr par- ganahs during the month of October. 8. In the tahsíls of Kángra and Núrpúr, during the month of October, there were 729 operations performed; 505 in the former, and 224 in the latter. The percentage of success, including the cases operated on in Chamba, was 96.36. Commencement of the cold season's work in the Amritsar tahsíl. 9. AMRITSAR DISTRICT.[ 32 ] however, comparatively fair success was obtained; but the towns and most of the larger villages, furnishing only a small proportion of vaccinations, remain badly protected from small-pox. Number vaccinated in Tarn Táran tahaíl. This tahsíl contains a population of 2,41,100, and the total number of vaccinations was 6,065, of which 97.91 were successful. The number of villages visited by the vaccinators was 325, aggregating 33,852 houses; and the proportion of vaccinations to houses was 17.9 per cent., being 8 per cent. less than that obtained in the Amritsar tahsíl. In most of the towns and some of the larger villages the proportion of vaccinated cases to houses was small, ranging from 6 to 11 per cent. 12. AJNALA.[ 33 ] Number vaccinated in the Kasúr tahsíl. account of the opposition met with last year, many villages had been very imperfectly vaccinated. This was tried more as an experiment to test the work of the previous year, and to find out in what condition the population had been left with regard to protection against small- pox. The result obtained with respect to numbers vaccinated was a decided success ; it also demonstrated the fact, if proof were wanting, how inadequately protected a place may be left immediately after having been visited by a large staff of vaccinators; and also the possibility of a severe and extensive epidemic of small-pox following close in their wake. For example[ 34 ] villages visited was 360, containing in the aggregate about 18,370 houses; and the proportion of vaccinations to' houses averaged 42 per cent. 17. KAHUTA.[ 35 ] opposed to it. In many villages, especially those near the left bank of the Indus, the people received vaccination with extreme disfavour, and the attempt to introduce it amongst them had to be given up. A fair amount of success was however obtained in other parts of the tahsíl, especially in the thánah of Khanpúr, and the villages in the neighbourhood of the town of Harípúr. This success, partial though it was, was due chiefly to the assistance rendered by Shaikh Abdul Rassúl, Extra Assistant Commissioner, at Haripúr, who took much interest in the work. This tahsíl has frequently been visited by severe and extensive epidemics of small-pox, and a large mortality from that disease occurs almost every year. In the town of Khanpúr, which contains about 600 houses, there were during the past year no less than 68 deaths from small-pox, and as many as 89 in the other villages of the same thánah, giving a total of 157 deaths from small- pox alone. Number vaccinated in the Haripúr tahsíl. The number of operations performed in this tahsíl during the latter half of the month of March was 2,799, of which 98 per cent. were successful. There were 123 villages in which vaccination was carried on, and the proportion of vaccinations to houses was 26.7 per cent., a fair average considering the opposition at first encountered. Total number vaccinated during the year. 20. The result of the year's operations is shown in the following table:[ 36 ] year one native superintendent and four vaccinators were employed during nearly the whole of the vaccinating season in the city of Lahore, where a comparatively small amount of work was done. A third is to be attributed to the rapidity and success with which vaccination was extended in the district of Ráwalpindi. Distribution of vaccine lymph. 21. During the past year supplies of lymph and crusts were sent to the following Medical Officers :[ 37 ] One native superintendent was heavily fined for persistent neglect of duty; a vaccinator was discharged for taking bribes, and two others were fined and degraded from 1st to 2nd class pay, on account of re- peated acts of negligence, and keeping up an inferior description of work. List of those brought to favorable notice. 24. In conclusion, I have the honor to submit to the favorable notice of Government, the names of the undermentioned tahsíldárs and others who, by the good example they set and the efficient assistance they rendered, were the means of extending the benefits of vaccination to many who, without their assistance, would have remained unpro- tected against small-pox.

Proceedings of the Hon'ble the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab in the Department of Agriculture, Revenue and Commerce,( 2 ) 10. The reports on Lahore, Dehli, and Amritsar again show very poor results. In all three places the apathy of the Municipalities is remarkable, and in the last case (Amritsar) His Honor regrets to observe that the Civil Surgeon has done little or nothing for vaccination. The attention of the Commissioners of those Divisions and the Municipal Committees is again directed to this subject. 11. Acknowledging the effectual assistance given by the Civil Authorities in most districts to the Vaccination Department, the Lieutenant-Governor hopes that in the report of next year the same will be recorded of all. The appalling mortality from small-pox must impress on all District Officers the absolute neces- sity for the general introduction of successful vaccination ; and His Honor expects that they will take every opportunity of enlightening the people, especially the Municipal Committees, as to its advantages. 12. The number of deaths from small-pox this year was 25,611, showing a small decrease in comparison with last year, though still in excess of those registered in 1867-68. His Honor considers this rate still very high, but agrees with Dr. Newton in thinking that perhaps part of the apparent increase is due to the increased efficiency of registration, especially as by far the larger portion of the deaths take place in rural districts. 13. Dr. Newton proposes to check the spread of small-pox by making the headmen of villages responsible that the cases are properly isolated. The Lieu- tenant-Governor considers this proposal impracticable. A somewhat similar proposal was made before for the enforcement of small-pox quarantine, but Civil Officers generally held that it could not be enforced with any good results. The responsibilities and duties of village headmen are already numerous and important, and there is an objection to imposing upon them a new burthen such as that suggested, which cannot be said to have any special connection with their proper work. The Lieutenant-Governor acknowledges the efforts of the Rána of Erkí in encouraging vaccination among his people. Commendatory letters will be sent to Extra Assistant Commissioner Gopál Sahái and Sub-Assistant Surgeon Jaswant Rái, of Multán, and to the Municipality of Multán. In accordance with Dr. Newton's request, the Commissioners of their respective divisions will be directed to send commendatory perwánas to Tahsíldárs Ajágar Mall (Jagádhrí), Nand Lál (Naraingarh), Rádhá Kishen (Ludiánah), Jowáhir Lál (Gujránwála), Jagannáth, Sanjí Mall, and Láj Saran (Siálkot), Thákur Dás (Jhang), and to Náib Tahsíldár Muhammad Azím Khán (Hushiárpúr). 14. The Lieutenant Governor is very sensible of the services rendered during the year by Dr. Newton, Officiating Superintendent-General of Vaccination ; and the work of Dr. J. Bennett, Officiating Superintendent of Vaccination, also deserves commendation. But, although the working of the department through- out the year shows some improvement, much still remains to be done, and con- tinued efforts are necessary.

ANNUAL REPORT ON VACCINE OPERATIONS IN THE PUNJAB FOR THE YEAR 1874-75. FROM A. M. GARDEN, Esquire, Superintendent General of Vaccination, Punjab. To T. H. THORNTON, Esquire, Secretary to Government, Punjab. SIR, I have the honor to submit, for the information of the Honorable the Lieutenant Governor of the Punjab, my Report on Vaccine Operations in the Punjab for the year 1874-75. Numbers vaccinated by the Provincial Establish- ment,2 attacked were adults, and all but one had been inoculated formerly. Reports were sent at once by Rájahs and Ránas on small-pox appearing in their Territories, with request for vaccinators to be sent. 3. KAPURTHALA.3 In Rúpar and in Umballa the work was well done. In the district work went on fairly well. The District Officers and their subordinates assisted, with the exception of &quot; Sheo Parshád,&quot; Tahsíldar of Rúpar, who would not help, and did not come near me when I was at Rúpar. A Native Superintendent was sent with a letter from the Commissioner of the Division to the Kalsia Sardár, whose estate lies in the Umballa District. The Sardár ordered the Native Superintendent to leave his village at once, and took no notice of the letter. Subsequently Bahádur Lál, Superin- tendent of the estate, assisted the vaccinators. 7.

STATEMENT No. VIIProceedings of the Honorable the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab in the Home Department,REPORT ON VACCINE OPERATIONS IN THE PUNJAB, FOR THE YEAR 1875-76. BY A. M. GARDEN, Esquire, Superintendent General of Vaccination for the Punjab. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Lahore: PRINTED AT THE CENTRAL JAIL PRESS, 1876.
ANNUAL REPORT ON VACCINE OPERATIONS IN THE PUNJAB FOR THE YEAR 1875-76. FROM A. M. GARDEN, ESQUIRE, Superintendent General of Vaccination, Punjab. To LEPEL GRIFFIN, ESQUIRE, Secretary to Government Punjab. SIR, I have the honor to submit, for the information of the Honorable the Lieutenant Governor of the Punjab, my Report on Vaccine Operations in the Punjab for the year 1875-76. Numbers vaccinated by Provincial Establish- ment,( 2 ) Surgeon-Major I. Newton, as Superintendent, from 1st April 1875 to 7 th December, and as Officiating Superintendent General from 10th December 1875 to 7th March 1876. Dr. Ferguson, as Officiating Superintendent, from 8th December 1875 to 8th February 1876. Surgeon J. Bennett, as Officiating Superintendent, from 9th February to 31st March 1876. 2. During the hot months work was carried on chiefly in the hill territory of Bisáhir and in the Hazárá and Murree hills. The Rájah of Bisáhir had his son vaccinated, and oppo- sition was not met with in his country. Small-pox appeared in several places in the hills amongst people who had lately come from the plains. It appeared at Solun and Subáthú. Vaccinations and revaccinations were freely performed. The disease was confined to natives. In Simla operations were, as usual, performed during the whole season. Great difficulty was experienced in keeping up the vaccine disease and supply of virus. This was perhaps caused by the exceptional weather and long continued rains. In Kálká not a single case of small-pox occurred owing to the excellent arrangements of Captain Corbyn, Assistant Commissioner. Hitherto this disease has almost invariably yearly appeared there. In October the hill territory of Bhagal was done. The Rájah gave every assistance, and promised to have his son, an infant, vaccinated next year. 3. DELHI.( 3 ) was young and inexperienced, and had not much influence with the people. In the city of Karnál for several days nothing could be done. Afterwards, with the help of two Members of the Municipal Committee, about 600 children were vaccinated. Some of the Members sent their families away, thereby showing a very bad example to the people, and causing them extra fear of vaccination. The Pánipat Tahsíl was done in a fortnight, but the Karnál took a month. Much trouble was met with in the Kaithal Tahsíl of this district at first; finally a fair amount of work was done. Small-pox was prevalent in many parts. Dr. Newton says that the people in this and the Delhi District are beginning to hide deaths from small pox. 5. UMBALLA.( 4 ) In the districts of Lahore, Gujránwála, Gujrát, Jhelum, Rawalpindi, and Hazárá, work was also carried on by the Provincial Establishment. The Civil authorities have assisted in it, and have everywhere endeavoured to render vaccination popular, and their subordinates have also worked well. In most towns the Members of the Municipal Commitees assisted willingly. In some, however, they would not, and much pre- cious time was lost. In some districts work was for a time almost at a standstill on account of the great prevalence of fever and other diseases. To this the great prevalence of disease in the early part of the cold season, and to the time of the district subordinate officials, lambardárs of villages, &c., being so much taken up with preparations for the troops marching to and from the Delhi camp, and also to the slowness with which work was for some time carried on in the Delhi District, is to be attributed the great falling off in numbers vaccinated during this year. It is also, I trust;, partly due to the smaller number of unprotected children to be found in the villages of those districts which have repeatedly been gone over by the vaccinators. DISPENSARY, MUNICIPAL, &c., VACCINATIONS. DELHI CITY.( 5 ) Committee helped. Mr. Pitcaithly, Secretary to the Com- mittee, has always urged on the people to accept vaccination. The subordinates, Munshís, &c., in the Government offices, as they have always done, again opposed vaccination, and would not listen to either the Deputy Commissioner, Colonel Fendall, or Mr. Pitcaithly. LUDHIANA TOWN.( 6 ) than 84 native gentlemen (Members of the Municipal Commit- tee, Chaudrís, &c. ) are said to have given efficient assistance to the vaccinators,( 7 ) vaccinators were employed, of whom four were Hakíms and two had been inoculators; many leading residents in towns assisted.

Comparative Statement showing the number of persons vaccinated and the number of those persons who were successfully vaccinated in the Punjab in each of the undermentioned official years. NOTE,Proccedings of the Honorable the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab in the Home Department,( 2 ) record what Government officials have favoured the operations of the vaccine establishment. All Tahsíldárs are required by Government to lend such assist- ance as may fairly be asked, and such influence as is at their command, for the promotion of what is an unmixed benefit to the people, if conducted with judgment and respect to popular prejudice. On this point His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor desires to impress upon the Superintendent-General and Commissioners of divisions, and district officers, the necessity for conducting vaccine operations with caution and gentleness. 6. During the past year many complaints have reached the Government, both directly from the mouths of the people concerned while His Honor was on tour in the southern districts of the province, and indirectly through the Police Department and Commissioners, of the manner in which vaccina- tors perform their duties. Many of these complaints are no doubt exagge- rated, but although popular prejudice against vaccination is diminishing in many parts of the country it is still strong. No compulsion whatever should be used by Tahsíldárs or district officials, nor does the Lieutenant- Governor approve of the practice of sending tahsíl servants with vaccinators. All that can be done by persuasion and by impressing upon the people the advantages of vaccination should be done by district officials; but the time has not yet arrived in India when vaccination can be made compulsory, and no approach to compulsion will receive the sanction or approval of the Lieutenant- Governor. ORDER.REPORT ON VACCINE OPERATIONS IN THE PUNJAB, FOR THE YEAR 1876. BY A. M. GARDEN, Esquire, Superintendent General of Vaccination for the Punjab. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Lahore: PRINTED AT THE CENTRAL JAIL PRESS, 1877.
ANNUAL REPORT ON VACCINE OPERATIONS IN THE PUNJAB FOR THE YEAR 1876. FROM A. M. GARDEN, ESQUIRE, Superintendent General of Vaccination, Punjab. To LEPEL GRIFFIN, ESQUIRE, Secretary to Government Punjab. SIR, I have the honor to submit, for the information of the Honorable the Lieutenant Governor of the Punjab, my Report on Vaccine Operations in the Punjab for the year 1876. Change in the time for submitting reports. The Reports have hitherto included operations performed during the official year, but are now to be rendered for the calendar year. The present Returns show the work done from the 1st of January to the 31st December 1876. They will therefore include the operations performed in the months of January, February, and March, which were included in the last Annual Returns ; an abstract for those months is therefore appended, so that when necessary, corrections can be made. An account of the work done during the three first months of the year was given in the last Report; it is therefore unnecessary to repeat it here. Numbers vaccinated by the Provincial establish- ment; percentage of success and cost. The numbers vaccinated by the Provincial establishment are 2,85,068. Of these 2,80,831 were primary vaccinations, and 4,237 were revaccinations. Of the primary vaccinations 2,67,069, or 98.52 per cent., were successful, and of the revaccinations 2,837, or 76.55, per cent., were successful. The numbers vaccinated by the Provincial establishment during the year 1875 were 2,99,872 ; there were therefore 14,804 fewer vaccinations in 1876 than in 1875. The reason for this decrease, which occurred during the early months of the year, was given in the last Report. The total cost was Rs. 59,510-15-1, and of each successful case anas 3 pies 6 and a fraction. The numbers vaccinated by Dispensary establishments are 38,743. Of these 37,728 were primary vaccinations, with 30,100, or 86.14 per cent., successful, and 1,015 were revac- cinations, with 701, or 79.65 percent., successful. The total cost was Rs. 3,854-5-3, and of each successful case anas 2 and a fraction of a pie. There were 39 vaccinators employed.
2 The numbers vaccinated by Municipal vaccinators are 22,388. Of these 21,710 were primary, with 18,271, or 91.81 per cent., successful, and 678 were revaccinations, with 329, or 58.85 per cent., successful. The total cost was Rs. 2,200-11-11, and of each successful case ana 1 pies 10 and a fraction. There were 34 Municipal vaccinators. The numbers vaccinated by Local Fund vaccinators are 46,880. Of these 46,413 were primary, with 36,908, or 85.93 per cent., successful, and 467 were revaccinations, with 340, or 79.43 per cent., successful. The total cost was Rs. 2,669-12-6, and of each successful case ana 1 pie 1 and a fraction. There were 65 Local Fund vaccinators. The numbers vaccinated by men employed by Native States are 4,194, of which 3,439 were primary, with 2564, or 75.08 per cent., successful, and 755 were revaccinations, with 479, or 65.52 per cent., successful. The total cost was Rs. 480, and of each successful case anas 2 pies 6 and a fraction. There were 4 Native States vaccinators; 16 Hakíms were also employed by Native States, who performed 4,656 vaccinations, and were paid Rs. 9-11-0. There were 5 Hakíms employed in Government districts, who performed 1,804 vaccinations, of which 1,383, or 72.25 per cent., were successful. These men did not receive pay. Hospital Assistants attached to Dispensaries performed 2,217 vaccinations, of which 1,861, or 87.90 per cent., were success- ful. They received no pay for this work. Only three Returns of cantonment vaccinations have been received, and but one of these is made out correctly. This one is from Jullundur. The others merely show the numbers vaccinated, without stating the success obtained; 2,330 vaccinations were performed in these three cantonments, thus : Umballa 1,455, Jullundur 842, and Siálkot 33. The grand total of all operations performed in the Punjab during the year 1876 is 4,05,950 at a cost of Rs. 68,725-7-9, and for each successful case of anas 3 and a fraction of a pie, At the conclusion of the year the Provincial establish- ment consisted of3 before known. The patients admitted into the hospital came from widely different parts4 accustomed and favorable to vaccination, no trouble was expe- rienced. In many places nothing could be done on account of the great sickness and mortality. In the towns of Núrma- hal, Ráhon, and Nawashahr, the Municipal Committee gave no help. It is very rare indeed to find any Municipal Committee ready to give assistance. One or two members do so, but that would probably be the case were they not members. The Committees are lavish in their promises of giving aid, but they do nothing; sometimes some of them purposely absent themselves. It is because of its being so rare to meet with a Committee who really will assist that I have specially mentioned that of Nakodar. In the districts where native superintendents, with their staff of vaccinators, were placed, work went on fairly well, but a less amount than usual was accomplished. A few complaints have reached me against the conduct of the vaccinators. In the Gujránwála district, where last year complaints had been made (though nothing definite was alleged against the vacci- nators), the District Superintendent Police informs me that after enquiry and personal observation he believes vaccination to be popular among the people. 6. Dr. J. Bennett, superintendent of vaccination, con- ducted operations during the hot weather in the Murree hills and in part of the Kashmír territory. His Highness the Mahárájah had as a tentative measure allowed of vaccinations being performed in the parts of his State adjoining the Hazárá and Murree hills. Work was done here in so satisfactory a manner, the people showing so little objection to it, that permission was requested for its extension to other places. This was at once granted. Dr. Bennett found everywhere extensive traces of small-pox, both recent and old, and gives as an example of its great severity the ravages it had com- mitted in one out of many villages which he inspected. There were only 50 houses in the village, and he found there 55 children under 6 years of age with recent marks of the disease in various degrees of severity. Before leaving Kashmir he vaccinated 11,817 people, 98.0 percent. of which operations were successfully done. Considering that this is the first time that vaccination has been introduced into the country, the success obtained is very good, and Dr. Bennett deserves much credit for the capable manner in which he conducted the work. He trusts that the Government will in some suitable way recognize the able and willing assistance given by the Kashmir officials who were appointed by His Highness the Mahárájah to arrange for the work, and whose names, &c., are given in another place. Dr. Bennett also says :5 secured.&quot; In the cold season Dr. Bennett worked in the Ferozepore and Amritsar districts. In the Moga tahsíl of Ferozepore great opposition was met with, and &quot;probably half the infantile population remain unvaccinated.&quot; In the Zíra tahsíl very little opposition was offered, because of the interest and assistance given by the tahsíldár. 9,384 vaccinations were performed here, and had it not been for the great sickness prevalent, many more would have been done. This number is, however, 2,500 in excess of that done in Moga. In the Amritsar tahsíl great opposition was met with, which was unexpected, as usually a very fair amount of success was met with. In the Tarn Táran tahsíl, however, work was carried on successfully. DISPENSARY, MUNICIPAL, &C., VACCINATIONS. DELHI CITY.6 LUDHIYANA7 Muzaffar Khán, had the children of his family and of his rela- tions vaccinated, and a number of other people then followed his example. Over 360 children were vaccinated here. In former years the number had never reached 50. The Shiah sect of Muhammadans would not allow of any of their children being vaccinated. Inoculation is much practised in the district. One of the vaccinators is a Hindú, and cannot speak Pashtú, both serious drawbacks; a Pashtú-speaking Musal- mán should be put in his place. BANNU.8 the rural population, but adds that this is not the case in towns. He instances the town of Farukhnagar, where the people are most prejudiced, and would have nothing to say to vaccination, though he several times spoke to the leading men, and endeavoured to get them to take an interest in it. It does not appear that the Civil Surgeon tests the accuracy of the returns by personal inspection, and the Deputy Commis- sioner is correct in saying that he should make tours during the vaccination season, in order to test the truthfulness of the vaccinator's reports, PESHAWAR.9 The usual statements are appended, and a list of the names of Native gentlemen and others who personally encouraged vaccination is given, with a request that their good services may be recognised in some manner by the Honorable the Lieutenant Governor. The names of those who assisted in the first three months of the year were entered in the last reports. Names of those who assisted and encouraged vaccination. His Highness the Mahárájah of Kashmír.

Proceedings of the Hon'ble the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab, in the Homo Department, No. 4317, dated December 1879. READ( 2 ) the birth-rate he taken at 40 per mille, as stated in paragraph 2 of the report, and which, judging from the returns obtained by the Sanitary Commissioner, would seem to be not excessive, the number of births annually would be about 800,000, for whose protection against the ravages of small-pox the officials of this Depart- ment are required to provide. Against these figures the successful vaccina- tions of the past year, by the special Provincial establishment, are shown to amount to 391,529 on subjects of all ages, those on infants tinder one year reaching only 157,115 in the Punjab districts, or about one-fifth of the births. It is true that in addition to this there are the operations of locally entertained vaccinators numbering, according to the returns submitted, 75,756 successful cases, of which 43,116 were those of infants under one year, the aggregate of infants operated on through both agencies being thus scarcely more than one-fourth of the estimated births; but, as before observed, the local returns are not considered reliable, so that the above must be looked upon as far too favourable a statement, and the only figures to be accepted as approximate- ly correct are those of the Provincial establishments. 5. It is certain that we are not making that progress which the urgency of the case demands. The special Provincial establishment has been at work 15 years, and the following is a brief outline of the extent of its operations during that period:( 3 ) tricts wherein work was carried on vigorously, but at the expense of the older localities. The work done during the 9 years the new arrangements have been in operation, is shown below :Report on Vaccine Operations in the Punjab, for the year ending 31st March 1879. FROM JOHN BENNETT, ESQUIRE, M.D., Officiating Superintendent-General, Vaccination, Punjab. To L. H. GRIFFIN, ESQUIRE, Officiating Secretary to Government, Punjab, SIR, I have the honor to submit, for the information of the Hon'ble the Lieutenant-Governor, my report on Vaccine Operations for the year 1878-79. 2. The aggregate number of operations performed by all establishments, during the year, was 481,922, a decrease of 13,519 as compared with that of the previous year, which decrease, as will subsequently be shown, is owing to a falling off in the number of Dispensary vaccinations ; the number of successful primary vaccinations was 435,649, and the percentage of success in the cases returned as having been inspected was 97.11 ; the number of re-vaccinations was 16,503, the ratio of success being 60 per cent; but not much reliance can be placed on the percentages of success in re-vaccinations, as the vaccinators have the greatest difficulty in distinguishing the points of success or non-success in many of the cases. The aggregate cost amounted to Rs. 66,453-6-9, as against Rs. 69,762-3-9 in the previous year, a decrease of Rs. 3,308-13-0, and each successful case cost annas 2 and pies 47, a slight diminution from preceding year. In proportion to the births of the same year, taking the annual birth-rate at 40 per mille of population, or about 704,160 births, the successful vaccinations under one year of age, numbering 206,930, were only 293 per cent., showing that at the end of the year under report nearly three-fourths of the infantile population remained unprotected from small-pox. 3. The Provincial establishment consisted of:( 2 ) establishment during the year ; while the average number vaccinated by each vaccinator shows a decrease of 187.19. This falling off is, in great measure, to be attributed to the great sickness and mortality from diseases of the zymotic class, which in the antumn and early winter months largely prevailed in so many districts of the Punjab; the season's work was also impeded by the sickly condition of many of the vaccinators, not a few of whom from repeated attacks of fever were for a time unable to go on with their work. But, had it not been for the great opposition met with by the large staff of men working under my immediate supervision in the districts of Delhi and Karnál, the ground thus lost would ultimately have been recovered, and the year's record would have shown a much larger out-turn of work. As in former years, the arm-to-arm method of vaccinating was adhered to, and on this depends the high standard of success maintained. Of the cases which came under my own personal observation, the ratio of success in primary operations was found to be 98.3 per cent., or 0.7 per cent. more than that given in the above statement. To avoid misunderstanding it is necessary to explain that the apparent discrepancies between the ratios of successful vaccinations given in the body of the report, and those entered in the appended statements (Nos. I and III) arise from the fact of their having been calculated from different data : in calculating the percentages of success embodied in the report, the unknown cases, according to the plan hitherto followed, have been excluded from the total; while in the calculation of the same ratios given in the statements, in accordance with the method adopted in para. 12 of Government of India, Home Department letter No. 136, dated 28th May 1879, the unknown cases have been included, and classed in the same category with unsuccessful operations. The total expenditure of the special establishment amounted to Rs. 58,406-5-4, as against Rs. 59,901-12-8 expended during the previous year, and the cost of each successful case was annas 2 and pies 6.74( 3 ) 9. Native States.( 4 ) This table shows the results in the four tahsíls overtaken :( 5 ) UMBALLA DISTRICT. 15. Proceeding from Karnál the Vaccinators commenced operations in this district about the middle of March. The district Native Superintendent with four vaccinators had been employed throughout the cold season in the Umballa tahsíl, but the people having been unfavourably inclined, a comparatively small number of operations was done: in the tahsíls of Pipli and Jagádhri, on the other hand, the operation was fairly well received, and a satisfactory amount of work was accomplished. This table shows the results in the three tahsíls entered on :( 6 ) number vaccinated 16,472; percentage of success in primary cases 98.88; and ratio successfully vaccinated per mille of population 43.24( 7 ) (a). Delhi District.( 8 ) (g). Mooltan Town.( 9 ) in primary cases was 95.52 per cent., a suspiciously high figure, especially with respect to the work of the vaccinator employed in the rural circles.

From Surgeon-Major H. W. BELLEW, C.S.I., Sanitary Commissioner, Punjab, to the Secretary to Government, Punjab.( 2 ) 5. The percentages of successful cases to total operations will be seen from the subjoined statement :( 3 ) of their number, Munshi Gurdial Singh and Jahangiri Mal, absolutely refused to appear at the meeting when the question was being discussed. My stay here being limited, and finding it impossible to introduce vaccination without assistance from the district authorities, I addressed a letter to Mr. Roberts, the Deputy Commissioner, on the subject. This officer, shortly after visiting this town in the course of his tour through the district, exerted his best influ- ence in the matter, and, pointing out to the Municipal Committee the short- sightedness of their conduct, succeeded in securing their co-operation &quot; I believe that much of this opposition is the consequence of ignorance as to the objects and properties of vaccination, and that it will be to a great extent overcome by the appointment of permanent vaccinators in each district, who will have greater opportunities of informing the people concerning the benefits of the practice than is the case under the system of occasional visits by strangers, as has hitherto been the case. In reviewing the outturn of the work effected by the dispensary and other local establishments, Dr. Bennett states that no assistance in vaccination was received from the Municipal Committees of Delhi, Amritsar and Sonepat. This is much to be regretted, and is by no means creditable to the members composing these corporations. As it is, the people are( 4 ) ence to Dr. Bennett's report that small-pox inoculation was carried on in the districts of Kangra, Hoshiarpur, Shahpur, Dera Ismail Khan, Muzaffargarh, and in the Sirmur State. I would suggest the extreme desirability of put- ting a stop to this practice, as there is no doubt that it is the cause of widely disseminating small-pox and greatly aggravating the natural prevalence of that disease. Proceedings of the Hon'ble the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab in the Home Department,( 5 ) a small amount of aid from the Civil Surgeons at the head-quarters of each district, or from the civil officers whose co-operation and influence must naturally he of great importance in the efficient working of any such scheme as that referred to; thus what the Lieutenant-Governor considers the chief guarantee of success had been overlooked, and His Honor was compelled to request a further consideration of the proposal, pointing out especially that the object to be kept in view should be the working out of a district plan for vaccination. He wished this to be the foundation of the new scheme for the reorganization of that department, and he has expressed an opinion that, as there are great advantages to be gained from using the heads of dispensaries in superintending the operations of the working staff, the new scheme should provide for the employment of that agency, and for utilizing the services of Civil Surgeons and throwing on them the responsibility of carefully supervis- ing the work within their respective districts. Anything short of such an arrangement as that which renders the district organization complete within itself must, in His Honor's opinion, fail. It is his special desire that his views on this point should be circulated among local officers to prepare them for giving effect to such scheme when it has been matured. In the meantime, as the season for vaccine operations is approaching, and there must be delay in working out the details of any new organization, His Honor has reluctantly consented to these operations being carried on for this season under the old system; but it is hoped that improved and satisfactory arrangements will be matured before the work of another season is entered upon. 5. The Lieutenant-Governor notices with satisfaction the cordial assistance rendered to the cause of vaccination by His Highness the Raja of Faridkot and the Raja of Bashahr, and the efforts made by the Deputy Commissioner of Kangra, Colonel Jenkins ; the Deputy Commissioner of Gurgaon, Mr. Roberts ; and the Civil Surgeon of Umballa, Dr. Bateson, to promote its success. The practice of inoculation is reported to exist in the districts of Hoshiarpur, Shah- pur, Dera Ismail Khan and Muzaffargarh, and the Deputy Commissioners of these districts should use their influence to discourage its continuance. The members of Municipal Committees, as a rule, exerted their influence in favour of vaccination, but there is still room for improvement in this respect, notably in the districts of the Delhi division and in Amritsar. ORDER.Report on Vaccine Operations in the Punjab for the year ending 31st March 1880. FROM JOHN BENNETT, ESQUIRE, M.D., Superintendent General of Vaccination, Punjab, To W. M. YOUNG, ESQUIRE, Secretary to Government, Punjab. SIR, I have the honor to submit, for the information of the Hon'ble the Lieutenant-Governor, my Report on Vaccine Operations for the year 1879-80. 2. The aggregate number of operations performed throughout the Province during the year was 381,166, showing a decrease of 100,756 from the number vaccinated in the previous year. This decrease, the causes of which will hereafter be adverted to, has taken place in the out-turn of work effected by all establishments. There were 347,987 primary vaccinations recorded as successful, against 435,649 of the previous year; and the percentage of success, classing the unknown with the unsuccessful cases in the calculation, was 9417. The number of re-vaccinations was 11,674, against 16,503 of the previous year, the ratio of success recorded being 44.74 per cent., as compared with 60 per cent. But, as has been mentioned in the Report for previous year, much difficulty is not unfrequently experienced in accurately distinguishing the features of success and non-success in many re-vaccination cases, and the figures of the vaccinators are, as a rule, far from reliable in this respect. The aggregate cost amounted to Rs. 56,332-4-10, as compared with Rs. 66,453-6-9 in the preceding year,( 2 ) exceptional nature, there is reason for believing that the check to the progress of operations will prove but of short duration. These causes may be enumerated as follows:( 3 ) rife in the places where they had been at work. Fortunately the district has a very energetic promoter of vaccination in the Deputy Commissioner, Colonel Jenkins, whose prompt and vigorous action on the occasions of these outbreaks was, in a great measure, the means of preventing their spreading and assuming epidemic dimensions. But had it not been for the comparatively high degree of protection by vaccination, which, for several years, has been maintained in this district, the efforts of the vaccina-- tors to stamp out the disease would not have been attended with such marked success. This table shows the out-turn of work in the different tahsíls :( 4) Statement No. V. Tahsíl. Total number vaccinated. Ratio of suc- cessful cases per 1,000 of population.

The Jagádhrí tahsíl was not completely overtaken, and having been vaccinated the previous year towards the end of the working season, it exhibits a much lower ratio than usual. In the Pipli tahsíl systematic work was not attempted. The total number of persons vaccinated in the district was 13,100, of which in primary cases 91.62 per cent. were returned as successful. The cause of this low percentage is due to the fact that, owing to the great difficulty experienced in collecting the vacci- nated children for inspection, a larger number than usual were returned as unknown, or, in other words, unsuccessful. LUDHIANA DISTRICT. 11. This district, entered on about the end of the first week in December, was overtaken by the end of January. Unlike the neighbouring district, Umballa, vaccination, judging from previous returns and reports, has been making fairly good progress here for the last six or seven years; and in no place was seen that bitterness of feeling against the operation which in earlier years was so plainly exhibited. In the year under report, however, owing to the prevalence of fever and small-pox in 1879, and the mortality and enfeebled state of health arising therefrom, a considerable falling off has taken place. The ratio of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population was 22.8 in the year under report, as compared with 20.6, and 37.3 in the seasons 1870-71, and 1874-75, respectively. This table shows the results obtained:( 5 ) pox in 1879 is 2,003, being in the ratio of 3.75 per 1,000 of population; in the town of Dharmkot, where great opposition has always been encountered, the ratio of deaths per 1,000 rose to 9.14. JULLUNDUR DISTRICT. 13. This, the next district undertaken, was entered on in the first week in March. The local native superintendent and his vaccinators had been at work here since the beginning of the season, and the tahsíls of Jullundur and Nawashahr alone remained to be done. The out-turn of work fell very much under that accomplished in former years: for example in 1874-75, the total number vaccinated in the tahsíls of Jullundur and Nawashahr, which having then been vaccinated under European super- vision, may be taken as a standard of comparison, was 9,720, and 8,404, respectively; whereas in the past season the total numbers amounted to but 5,481, and 3,224,( 6 ) GURDASPUR DISTRICT. 15. Three tahsíls of this district were visited, but in none of them, as the subjoined table will show, was anything like exhaustive vaccination carried out:( 7 ) vaccinated during the previous two or three years by the vaccinators employed in the service of the State, showing bad or imperfect vaccine marks, were again subjected to the operation; and the fact that successful results were for the most part obtained, was sufficient proof that no protection whatever had been conferred by the attempts at vaccination in the first instance. Although the State authorities, inasmuch as they spend a considerable sum of money every year in keeping up a strong body of vaccinators, show that they recognise the value of vaccination, as well as the necessity of bringing it within easy reach of the people, it cannot be doubted that vaccination for several years past, owing to incompetent management, has really been very much neglected in this State; but under a different regime( 8 ) seem to have been viewed with disfavor. The total number vaccinated was 16,757, the percentage of success in primary cases being 93.37 ; the ratio successfully vaccinated per 1,000 was 29.67. In 1879 there were 2,406 fatal cases of small-pox registered, being at the rate of 4.82 per 1,000. 18. There remain 10 other districts to be briefly noticed, in which vaccination was carried on by the district members belonging to the special establishment, and to each of which 1 Native Superin- tendent and 4 vaccinators were allotted. In this table the results obtained in each district are shown:( 9 ) The returns submitted by hakíms and by vaccinators employed by Native States are also included under the head of Dispensary Vaccination. (a). Delhi District.( 10 ) registers appeared to be correctly kept. A month's delay in commencing operations was caused by the failure of the vaccinators to produce the vaccine disease with the lymph supplied at the end of the hot season. Much credit is given to Assistant Surgeon Brij Lal Ghose, for the zeal, ability, and tact exhibited by him in conducting operations. The number of deaths referred to small-pox in 1879 was 390, being in the ratio of 4.24 per 1,000. In the town of Kasúr 341 operations were performed by a vaccinator paid from Municipal Funds. (f). Ferozepore Town.( 11) to be believed, it would appear that the vaccinations of the Hospital Assistant in question had been so inefficiently done that it was deemed necessary to vaccinate the cases a second time ; and this statement agrees with the results of my own inspection of the work done by another Hospital Assistant in the town of Garhshankar, whose operations were of a very imperfect kind, and calculated to depreciate the value of the operation in the eyes of the people. On the other hand, the work of the Government hakím in the town of Hoshiárpur was found to be of exceptionally good quality; the explanation of his success being that being a regularly trained vaccinator, he performed all his operations with lymph fresh from the arm.
