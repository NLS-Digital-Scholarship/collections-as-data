ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BENGAL, For the year 1897-98. BENGAL VETERINARY INSTITUTION. The curriculum.( 2 ) 11. As these experiments have turned out a success, I suggest that a certain amount of riding and gymnastics might very well be demanded at the examination. THE STUDENTS. 12. Class A.( 3 ) 22. Stipends other than Government stipends.( 4 ) per cent. in 1896-97. This favourable result is due to better nursing and also to better supervision. 35. The students had opportunity of studying most of the contagious diseases they will be called upon to diagnose, for we had 25 cases of Glanders, 76 of Rinderpest, 26 of Foot-and-Mouth, 9 of Tuberculosis, and 3 of Rabies, including one case in a cow (Appendices XII, XIII, XIV, and XV). 36 Two hundred and seventy-two operations were performed in the presence of the students during the year as against 166 in 1896-97, showing an increase of 106 (Appendix XVI). One accident happened owing to the struggles of a colt during castration: the animal broke his back. These unfortunate occurrences will happen now and again in spite of the greatest care, more especially in a Clinic which admits all animals irrespective of temper and vice. 37. The ambulances( 5 ) two cook rooms, (one for Muhammadans and Christians and one for Hindus), two eating rooms, a store room, a latrine and urinal and a bathing place. 51. Before the Hostel could be opened it became necessary to provide furniture, a staff, rules and a scale of dietary. 52. Government sanctioned a sum of Rs. 1,248 for furniture (Appendix XIX). 53. The staff consists of the Sub-Assistant Superintendent, 4 ward servants, 3 cooks, 2 sweepers, and one durwan. Besides his duties of Manager of the Hostel, the Sub-Assistant Superintendent was charged with the purchase of forage and bazar medicines, &c., for the Institution. He was also the Students' Gymnastic Instructor. The sanctioned pay of the staff amounts to Rs. 1,584 per annum (vide Appendix XX). 54. To this should be added Rs. 300 per annum for the Medical attendant since appointed who visits the Hostel in addition to other duties 55. The rules of the Hostel will be found in Appendix XXI and the scale of dietary in Appendix XXII. Government sanctioned a maximum outlay for boarding of Rs. 8 per student. 56. The trouble connected with these preliminaries was very great, and was not lessened by the behaviour of the students, who when the place was ready refused to enter on the ground of the expense and for other reasons, the true one probably being a liking for the greater freedom they had hitherto enjoyed. However, the prompt punishment of a ringleader created a favourable impression, and the students turned in and settled down. 57. The victualling of the Hindus was a difficult matter at first, and there were complaints about the cooking and quality of the rations, but I have got over them by daily inspecting samples of the food. This food is purchased by the Sub-Assistant Superintendent (a Brahmin) and a committee of students. The Hindu cooks are Brahmins. 58. Recently Government sanction has been obtained for the Sub-Assis- tant Superintendent to take his meals with the students, paying Rs. 10 towards its cost. This tends to maintain the quality of the food. 59. The chief difficulty has been to get the students to observe habits of cleanliness in the rooms, &c., but daily inspections and other means have brought about the desired result. 60. The students have certainly been healthier, stouter, cleaner, and brighter since they have lived in the hostel. 61. All the students attending the Institution were residents with one exception, and as his attendance at the lectures was not satisfactory, he was ordered into the Hostel during the last month of the session. 62. The number of boarders varied slightly owing to some of the students ceasing to attend (vide Appendix XXIII), but during the last month of the session 15 students of Class B, and 15 in Class A were residents. 63. The dietary charges during the months of August and September exceeded the sanctioned grant, as at that time no fixed scale was settled. During these months an extra charge for victualling the menials was incurred and therefore fresh sanction to adjust all these expenses had to be obtained from Government, but no additional grant was necessary, as the savings under the heads of the students dietary and contingencies were available to meet them. 64. The dietary charges of the students, including the victualling of the menials during the other months of the year, were under the sanctioned scale. 65. The latrine, which from its position in front of the Hostel is a nuisance and an eyesore, has not yet been removed. Government sanctioned Rs. 250 for the purchase of another site, but Babu Gopal Chunder Dass, the owner of the adjoining land which it was proposed to acquire for the purpose, offered to give a piece of land for the latrine only (size of land 17'-3" by 10') free of cost, but the Public Works Department has since pegged out a larger space, and this is more than Babu Dass will give. 66. The matter has therefore been referred back to Government, and sanction has been obtained to re-appropriate the Rs. 250 to purchase gymnastic apparatus for the students. 67. The connection of the Hostel water-pipes with the main has not yet been effected, and therefore water has to be carried from the nearest stand-pipe
( 6 ) for ordinary domestic purposes, and the students have to bathe in the Institution or in the neighbouring tanks. I have represented this most important matter several times. There are no doubt very good reasons for the delay, but I would submit that these will not prevent possible outbreaks of sickness from want of a proper water-supply. VETERINARY ASSISTANTS. 68. I append a complete list of the passed men of the Belgatchia Veterinary Institution, arranged according to seniority, and showing their employment. (Appendix XXIV). APPOINTMENT OP VETERINARY ASSISTANTS. 69. Baranagar Municipality, District 24-Parganas.( 7 ) 76. Dacca district.( 8 ) disease was reported to have been prevailing. From the report of the Veteri- nary Assistant it appears that no trace could be found of the disease when he visited the affected localities, as it had probably died out. He was ordered back to Calcutta on the 20th December 1897. 88. 24-Parganas.( 9 ) VETERINARY DISPENSARIES. 98. Sitamarhi.( 10 ) 109. The Veterinary Assistant reports upon the working of the Dispen- sary as follows:( 11 ) in the remaining animals, thorough measures had been taken by Mr. Macgillevray to prevent a further occurrence. 123. At Pertapore, the stable of Mr. Ian W. F. Campbell was inspected and I was informed that during the residence of his predecessor, Mr. Percy Jones, Glanders had occurred. But I found no external symptoms of Glanders amongst Mr. Campbell's horses: he was taking the necessary precautions to keep off the disease. 124. At Chuckia, Mr. J. A. M. Wilson had shot 9 of his horses and ponies for Glanders. I inspected his remaining horses and found no external symptoms of the disease. The animals were then isolated and he had taken necessary precautions. 125. No external signs of Glanders were seen amongst the animals of Mr. T. Macdonald at Ratassia, where Mr. Percy Jones had resided a short time back. 126. At Siwan, the stables of Mr. Power, the Planters' Engineer, were inspected and I learned that a horse had been recently destroyed by him for Glanders. Mr. Power was then on tour, but two horses were examined in his stable. No external signs of the disease amongst these animals were seen. 127. Teegrah, in Monghyr, was visited and I learned that a horse had recently been destroyed for Farcy. The horses, &c., of Mr. W. J. Marsham were seen and no signs of infection discovered. Mr. Marsham had taken trouble to disinfect his stables and to destroy his stable gear. He was recommended to keep his animals isolated, 128. At Kanti, the Adjutant of the Bihar Light Horse consulted me as to the precautions to be observed during the approaching man( 12 ) 139. Act I (B.C. of 1869), an Act for the prevention of cruelty to animals has also been extended to the Barhampur and Sonepur Fairs since November last. CONTAGIOUS CATTLE DISEASE IN MUFASSAL, 140. Appended will be found a statement extracted from the Calcutta Gazette showing the reports from the District Officers (Appendix XXIX). 141. I also append a synopsis of transactions in connection with cattle disease during the year under review (Appendix XXX). 142. Information which sometimes reaches me does not always confirm these reports, am led to believe that there have been serious losses from rinderpest and possibly from malignant sore-throat in places which, according to the Gazette, would appear to have had little or no disease. 143. A tabulated statement showing the districts where outbreaks of cattle disease occurred during the year 1897-98 is appended in the prescribed form (Appendix XXXI.) 144. I doubt if any of these returns are very accurate, but they are better, than nothing. 145. During the year I visited several places to investigate cattle disease, but in three or four cases I arrived after the outbreaks were practically over ; this was caused by the necessary information reaching me very late. 146. I therefore addressed the District Officers in accordance with para- graph 3, line 13 of 983A of 6th June 1897 from the Director of Land Records (as per Appendix XXXII) 147 Thirty one answers were favourable and thirteen unfavourable. A synopsis is attached (Appendix XXXIII.) 148. There appear to be certain practical difficulties in the way of adopting the suggestions I ventured to submit, viz.:( 13 ) last outbreak began in October 1896 and is still proceeding. I am speaking from actual admissions into the Belgatchia Infirmary, but it is not unfair to suggest that the disease prevailed before the date I give. 165. Unfortunately the Local Police appears to have no special means of gaining information about cattle disease, and there appears to be no necessity for reporting cattle disease to the Civil Veterinary Department. 1 have no knowledge that any efforts have been made during the year under review to combat Rinderpest in Calcutta. In fact one of the Chairmen of the Cor- poration doubted if the word " epizootic" in paragraph 334 of the Municipal Act of 1888 applied. 156. In continuation of steps that were recorded in last Annual Report by direction of the Agricultural Department, I enquired of the Commissioner of Police if he could given me any information as to the number of outbreaks and deaths from Rinderpest during recent years ; he told me that he could not do so, as there were no records in his office. 157. I then made the best arrangements I could for gaining the required information, and I ascertained that during the last four years about 16, 767 animals had died of Rinderpest in Calcutta and Suburbs and these animals if valued at Rs. 25 a head represent a loss of Rs. 4, 18, 925 ; but, of course, the indirect loss and inconvenience also represent a large sum. Needless to say, that the loss is not confined to private cattle; I have ascertained that the animals in the Municipal gowkhanas and in the jails, &c., also suffer. The Calcutta Municipality appears to suffer a loss of some Rs. 722 per annum, if I may judge from information to hand. 158. Rinderpest appeared amongst the animals of the Cossipore Munici- pality, during the year, but the outbreak was reported to me by that body, and I was able to send Veterinary students to treat the cases. 159. The disease also attacked the cattle of the Baranagore Municipality. Here again, I was able to render assistance. 160. I have been directed to draw up, in consultation with the Director of Land Records, clauses for combating epizootic cattle disease in Calcutta for consideration in connection with the New Calcutta Municipal Act. 161. I have sent on my suggestions, the loading idea being to substitute for compulsory slaughter with compensation as in Europe, compulsory isolation and free treatment, &c., as it is obvious that cattle cannot be slaughtered in this Province. INVESTIGATIONS, &c. RINDERPEST EXPERIMENTS. 162. In paragraph 151, page 14 of my Annual Report of 1896-97, I remarked: "I have been following Professor Koch's investigations with a view to benefiting Bengal. If it is found to be as safe in India as at the Cape, I propose to employ this method of treatment. 163. On the 1st May 1897 I saw the news of Dr. Koch's arrival in the papers, and wired to the Director of Land Records for permission to proceed to Bombay. This being sanctioned, I left on the 3rd, reached Bombay on the 6th, saw Professor Koch, and was able to wire to Darjeeling that he was willing to demonstrate his methods. The Bengal Government at once expressed willingness to defray expenses. I left Bombay on the 7th and reached Calcutta on the 10th May. 164. It was finally arranged by the Government of India that Professor Koch should demonstrate his method at Muktesar near Naini Tal, and I left Calcutta on the 7th June for that place. 165. I remained at Muktesar until the 19th June and reached Calcutta on 22nd. The demonstration which Professor Koch gave was most interesting. 166. In my letter No. 771V.D. of 26th June 1897, I reported " Professor Koch's work, though successful in the Laboratory, has still to be studied in its relations to Bengal cattle." Professor Koch impressed on me that much remained to be done in this direction. 167. Just prior to Professor Koch's arrival it had been announced in the Pioneer and other papers that Dr. Simpson of Calcutta had isolated and
( 14 ) held in his possession the microbe of Rinderpest. I thought that if Dr. Simpson had captured this germ, it would in all probability soon be easy to prepare vaccine against Rinderpest with it. At the same time I was aware that Dr. Simpson's experiments might possibly have been influenced by the presence of natural Rinderpest in the cattle-sheds in which he worked. 168. I therefore wrote and asked Dr. Simpson if the experiments could be performed under conditions which I would arrange, the result to be made public, and it the experiments failed to show Rinderpest, he would pay Rs. 50 towards cost. To all this Dr. Simpson agreed at once. 169. The experiments with Dr. Simpson's germs referred to below, were performed in his presence, but none of the control experiments were. 170. The results of the experiments which were carried out in his presence disappointed Dr. Simpson, and he declared himself willing to pay Rs. 50 towards the cost of the tost. 171 The subsequent controls were for my own satisfaction, but I am sure Dr. Simpson would have been glad to follow them had he remained in the country. 172. Five animals (B. 3, B. 5, B. 6, B. 7, and B. 8) were inoculated in the jugular vein with Dr. Simpson's germ in large doses in his presence. All reacted, 4 died and 1 recovered. The general symptoms were diarrhoea and enteritis, but they failed to show the peculiarities of Rinderpest. 173. Six more animals were selected and treated with extremely large deses of various material from B. 8 that had died; of these 2 died (B. 4 and C. 6) and 4 recovered (B. 1, C. 4, C. 5, and C. 7.) B. 4's death was due to septic( 15 ) 182. On the 31st August I received an urgent telegram from Muzaffarpur. I proceeded there at once and met Mr. Toomey of the Kanti Indigo Concern, who told me that Cattle plague had been raging on the estate since the 3rd August; that he had lost 86 head of valuable cattle, and that some 400 or 500 head of cattle had died in the neighbouring villages. He had heard that I wanted to experiment with Rinderpest. I submitted to him the case for and against Koch's method, as far as was known at the time, and he proposed in the most Public-spirited manner that I should treat his animals. Therefore he is the first person in India upon whose cattle modern Rinderpest treatment has been employed. 183. Having decided to inoculate, the next thing was to procure suitable material. It was obviously impossible to kill any cattle, owing to the religious opinions of the people. Moreover, observations upon cases that had succumbed during various outbreaks had shown me pretty clearly that the bile from cases that had died in the usual way was very often unsuitable. Hence there might arise an element of uncertainty which it was desirable to avoid. 184. Fortunately there is no objection to the slaughter of buffaloes which are even used for sacrificial purposes. Some fair-sized buffalo calves were there- fore procured. I inoculated them from a typical case of virulent rinderpest. 185. In due course these animals developed symptoms of rinderpest and were shot on the 6th or 7th day. The bile was examined carefully with a microscope and found to be good in each case. The bile was injected in 10 c. c. m. doses into bullocks as follows:( 16 ) Both developed rinderpest and one died. 193. On the 7th January a telegraphic report reached me of the reappear- ance of Rinderpest near Kanti, in the village of Harsair near the out-work of Raghai. I went to investigate and found that typical Rinderpest was raging. 194. Mr. Toomey requested me to inoculate the herd of cattle on the out-work, but the usual difficulty arose as to obtaining sufficient and suitable material. 195. It was therefore arranged that a small experimantal station should be erected in which material could be prepared and some further experiments carried out. 196. The place selected, on the banks of the little Gandak, was isolated, and exceedingly bleak at night though warm in the day. There was no shelter for the animals to speak of, and the weather during the experiments was cyclonic. These facts are mentioned, as I think they affected the temperatures to a certain extent. 197. A bamboo enclosure was put up, a chaukidar appointed, attendants told off, and the whole staff isolated for the time being. 198. On the 7th January several young buffalos were infected with material from a typical case of rinderpest, and were used as follows when the disease had developed:( 17 ) buffaloes, the dose being repeated in some cases. The details and dates will be found in Appendix XXXV. 208. The result of the test, which is, of course, far more searching than the animals are likely to be put to under ordinary circumstances, has been that none of the animals showed any outward signs of Rinderpest whatever, but the temperature of K/L 4 rose 4/5 of a degree F. on the 6th day, and the temperature of Kv. rose from 102 to 103.4 F. on the 6th day. (See Appendix XXXV). 209. I have to add that a subcutaneous injection of 1/1000 part of 1 c c m. of virulent blood is sufficient to cause the usual visible symptoms of Rinderpest to develop according to Dr. Kohlstock. 210. Amongst the various Bile experiments carried out at Belgatchia those of the 11th September assumed considerable importance in regard to the duration of the immunity conferred by Bile, because three animals inoculated on this date with 10 c.c.m. of the Bile from a bullock that had died on the 10th September of Rinderpest were subsequently attacked with natural Rinderpest, and one died, thus:( 18 ) disease in Bengal, it seems probable, from the work I have done, that by inject- ing virulent blood into a healthy animal and immediately afterwards injecting defibrinated blood taken from an immunized case, the healthy animal becomes subject to an extremely mild attack of rinderpest and recovers. This is what has happened in my experiments, but it remains to be seen if the attack is always as mild as has happened up to the present. 217. Should this method become recommendable for practical use, it will have this advantage, viz., that a mild attack of Rinderpest can be run through a herd (isolated for the purpose) and the owners' mind set at rest for probably some years. 218. But I do not think this method will commend itself generally to the raiyats of these Provinces, as it is rather too complicated for them to understand. Moreover, the dose of defibrinated blood required is large, which is also a draw-back. 219. I have been for some time engaged in attempting to prepare a useful serum of greater immunizing power than is obtained from animals that have recovered from an ordinany attack of Rinderpest. Should I succeed, it may bo possible to keep a stock of material at Belgatchia, ready for distribution. 220. The records, charts, &c., connected with these experiments have been carefully preserved, but they are somewhat bulky, would cost a good deal to print, and would be of interest to very few people. Therefore, I have not appended them to this report. 221. Besides the knowledge gained and reported above, a few other matters may be recorded, for instance: ( 19 ) injected in animals exposed to infection." The information was misleading because " citrate of potash " turned out to be the agent used, and not " citric acid." Moreover, the quantity of the drug was not stated. However, I experimented with a number of combinations of citric acid and citrate of potash, and found that small quantity of " citrate of potash " prevents coagulation, but it appears to have no appreciable effect in preventing decomposition ; and as blood outside a laboratory can only be prevented from decomposing rapidly with difficulty in this Province, even when a percentage of citrate of potash is added, this method, though interesting and ingenious, does not appear to be suitable for Bengal at present. (h) In one of his reports from South Africa Professor Koch does not appear to have finally decided if pigs may acquire rinderpest. I have inoculated six young pigs with large doses of rinderpest blood, in order to solve the question if they are subject to the disease in this Province. One pig was found dead on the loth day without showing premonitory symptoms. Post-mortem show- ed severe congestion of the lungs, liver, spleen, and heart ; the stomach was congested with some petechial spots on the mucous membrane, the intestines were slightly congested. These symptoms do not point to rinderpest, and as the others remained healthy, it appears that pigs do not suffer fom this disease. (i) An animal that has recovered from an attack of rinderpest does not re act in a typical manner when re-infected, but he does not seem to become absolutely immune against a blood injection ; for I find that a hypodermic injection of virulent rinderpest blood causes an important rise of temperature in a recovered animal, and in one case diarrhoea also occurred. 222. The Bengal Government granted a sum of Rs. 540 for experimental purposes. This money was expended. It will be seen that the number of ex- periments I have been able to carry out successfully with the assistance of Mr. Toomey would have involved a much larger sum had they failed. 222a. Besides the rinderpest experiments, I have studied the effects produced on animals by datura and abrus precatorius, but owing to want of time, enough has not yet been done to make a report worth perusal. 223. In June 1897 I was requested by the Principal Veterinary Officer, Army Veterinary Department, India, to test some mallein which had been issued by the General Medical Store-keeper. This I did, and reported to the effect that the sample sent to me was not reliable. 224. In July I was requested to test three horses belonging to the Battery at Barrackpore for glanders, as a control experiment. The horses were sent here, and treated with mallein, and I was able to report they were not suffering from the disease. 225. A few experiments have been made with tuberculine. According to results obtained, I find it re-acts in cases of tuberculous cattle in Bengal in much the same way as elsewhere. 226. A question of extreme importance to the hide trade of India has originated through two or three colonies closing their ports against this merchandise owing to the fear that rinderpest might be imported. 227. I have been directed to investigate if any such danger exists. 228. An estimate of the cost of the experiments has been prepared and submitted, and Government orders are being awaited. CATTLE FAIRS, SHOWS, &c. 229. I have to report that I have only had time to visit five fairs this year, owing to pressure of work. A great many other fairs have remained unvisited, which is highly regrettable, as these assemblies are probably one of the chief means of spreading epizootic disease. 230. I have, however, applied for two assistants in my letter No. 416V.D., dated 17th March 1898, and if they are sanctioned, a portion of their time might be devoted to this important purpose. 231. I append a list of fairs in Bengal (Appendix XXXVI). D 2
( 20 ) 232. Sitamarhi Fair.( 21 ) 253. A number of small sturdy ponies were on show. Major Pollock, 7th B.L., was purchasing for the Commissariat Department. His report has not reached me. I saw about 15 of his purchases, as the others were sent away before I inspected them, but I offered my services to the purchasing officer. 254. It would be well if the purchasing officers put themselves in touch with the Civil Veterinary Department on these occasions. 255. I detected no case of contagious disease amongst the horses or ponies at the fair. 256. Cattle.( 22 ) seen in the Fair for a number of years. The price of the best ponies was high, Rs. 450 being refused for one. 275. I append a list of prize-winners and some measurements (Appendix XLIV and Appendix XLV). 276. Tatoos were not much better than last year, but two prizes were awarded as an encouragement. 277. Donkeys.( 23 ) 300. Since the last Show an enclosure has been wired off for judging, which is convenient. 301. Very few animals appeared. The list of prize-winners is appended (Appendix L). No prize was given for "the best horse in the Show." The prize is evidently intended for native horse-breeders, and none of them com- peted in this class. 302. Cattle.( 24 ) 317. There were a few pens of cocks and hens. Some of them were fair; there were also some ducks. 318. The exhibition of vegetables and produce was very small, but some of the vegetables wore good in size. 319. I judged the bulls and bullocks. A Committee judged the other items. 320. On the 8th His Honour Sir Alexander Mackenzie inspected the Show, and distributed the prizes. 321. The programme of the Show (Appendix LII), the list of subscribers (Appendix LIII), the list of awards (Appendix LIV), and the names of the mem- bers of the Committee (Appendix LV) are attached. 322. The arrangement of the mela was similar to that of last year, but the cattle pens and other show stands were better. 323. Mr. Fischer and Babu Chandra Gati Mustaphi, though handicapped with other business, worked very hard to make the affair go off well. Babu Kumada Kinkar Mukerji lent his garden. 324. The subscriptions were large, amounting to Rs. 1,575. The Raja of Hitampur sent a heavy subscription. I should have been very glad to have seen some of his cattle at the Show. 325. A great number of gentlemen who owned prize-winners refused to accept their money prizes, and requested that the amount should be added to the Fund; this, I think, is creditable to their zeal for improving the local cattle. 326. With regard to future arrangements, I fancy that our experience rather points to the fact that two days are enough for the purpose of the Show. A five days' function keeps people too long away from their business. 327. I am glad to say that it is in contemplation to devote part of the savings on the Show to the purchase of some good bulls. HORSE AND PONY-BREEDING. 328. I have boon directed by His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor to study this subject in its relation to Bengal, as he has noticed that our animals have degenerated. 329. The subject is a large one, owing to the fact that horse and pony- breeding in this Province appears to have fallen upon very bad times, and will require careful handling if it is to be revived successfully. 330. The first thing to be done is to collect all the information we can from the various parts of Bengal in which there is any chance of horse and pony-breeding being successful. 331. This work, which will take some time to carry out, is receiving my attention. ARAB PONY STALLION AT BUXAR. 332. Babu Hurdhyan Singh, in whose charge the stallion "Ruby," which is a District Board property, is kept, reports that 56 mares, against 43 in last year, were covered by the stallion during the year under report (Appendix LVI). The result of the covering is not exactly known, as many of the mares came from distant places and different districts bordering Shahabad. But gene- rally the coverings were successful, and rarely any complaint was heard. The cost of feed and keep of the stallion is about Rs. 273 (Appendix LV1I). 333. In July Babu Hurdhyan Singh sent a report on the stallion, which will be found in Appendix LVIII. 334. I have seen one or two of Ruby's progeny; they are nice little ponies of the sort that a native likes to ride. Those I saw had good straight legs, and wore an improvement on the ordinary tat of the country. MULE-BREEDING. DONKEY STALLION AT GANTAK. 335. The Donkey stallion "Tiharan" that was maintained last year at Gantak under the charge of the Political Officer, Sikkim, for the improvement of the mule-breeding in Sikkim, having failed as a Mule-getter, the Inspector- General, Civil Veterinary Department, sent to Gantak in May another stallion, "Charakh," in place of the former.
( 25 ) 336. A report was received of the stallion in the month of January, when the Political Officer, Sikkim, stated as follows:( 26 ) 348. It will be recollected that my predecessor suggested a simple plan whereby up-country bulls were to be imported into Bihar and Tirhoot, and Sitamarhi cattle were to be sent to the lower districts. 349. The plan did not work as well in practice as was anticipated. Up-country bulls could not be procured, as the local raiyats objected to put with them, and my attempts to procure Sitamarhi bulls also failed. 350. This year I have been more successful, for eight Hissar bulls have been purchased and some 8 Sitamarhi bulls have been secured. But this work has revealed a startling fact, viz., the Hissar bulls are far inferior to those imported in former years. That the bulls on a large Government Farm like Hissar should deteriorate so rapidly must give rise to some surprise. The causes of this degeneration when ascertained would form a subject of deep interest to all those concerned in stock-raising. 351. But the apparent deterioration of the Hissar Farm bulls does not in any way alter the point of the remarks I made last year in reference to Bengal, viz.( 27 ) will permit, the land being used at present for tobacco and other crops. The soil is good, water is abundant, a railway station is near. Buildings. graneries, stables are ready to hand, and only require some repairs. 366. The land has been allowed to run to jungle somewhat, but the sale of some of the timber would defray the expenses of clearing. 367. There is accommodation, not only for cattle-breeding purposes, but for cattle-breeding experiments ; moreover, sheep and goat-breeding experi- ments might be carried out with advantage (see paragraphs 127, 128, 129 of my Annual Report, 1897). The latter are badly needed, as little seems to be known about the smaller ruminants. 368. I have therefore reported in favour of Pusa as a cattle-breeding farm, and the matter is under consideration of the Director of Lund Records and the Commissioner of Patna. 369. I have to add that the rock which apparently ruined the old stud was bad and expensive management ; that should not be forgotten in any scheme which is submitted under the head of breeding experiments. A sketch balance sheet has been forwarded to the Director of Land Records. 370. It will also be well if the enterprise is not overladen with too many extras in the shape of elaborate scientific cropping experiments, scholastic teaching, &c., though they are most important in their proper place. 371. I recommend that Pusa shall be a breeding farm, neither more nor less ; and that any other agricultural matters should be kept totally separated and under separate management, SHEEP AND GOAT-BREEDING. 372. During the past year I have endeavoured to collect information on this subject, but for want of time I have not been able to do much. However, I have corresponded with various agricultural bodies, and in two cases received inter- esting answers which I append (Appendices LXII and LXIII). I have also attempted to ascertain what is done in Bengal by conversing with various people, but those I have met so far, do not seem to understand much about the subject. 373. I think it is highly desirable that the subject should be gone into thoroughly on the Pusa Farm if the place is acquired for breeding purposes. TICK PLAGUE. 374. From appended documents (Appendices LXIV, LXV, LXVI) it will be seen that tick plague has received the attention of Government, who decided that horses, cattle, and forage imported from Australia should be inspected by the Veterinary Officer in charge of the Army Remount Depot, as my duties took me into the mufassal at that time of the year. 375. But I requested that in the case of any ticks being discovered that a telegraphic message should be sent to me. 376. I understand that no ticks were found by the Veterinary Officer on the imported horses nor in the imported forage. 377. I have not discovered any cattle suffering from tick plague in this Province during the year. THE STAFF. 378. The Assistant Superintendent.( 28 ) duties. They have been successful Lecturers, and have given me every satisfaction. Mr. D'Silva relieved me of the lectures on equine medicine, &c., as I found it impossible to attend regularly to this branch of the curriculum, owing to my frequent absence on duty. 380. 1 now consider myself fortunate in my teaching staff, and take this opportunity of thanking its members for the good work done during the year and to express a hope that we shall do as well next year. 381. The Sub-Assistant Superintendent is a new officer of the Institution rendered necessary by the opening of the Hostel. I had hoped when the first appointment was made to get the same person to combine with this appoint- ment that of Gymnastic Instructor. But the arraugement failed, and it was necessary to make other arrangements. Therefore another gentleman was appointed, and the duties of Sub-Assistant Superintendent are now separated from those of Gymnastic Instructor, and Rs. 20 of the former's pay as originally arranged go to remunerate the latter. This arrangement is before the Com- mittee for consideration. The new Sub-Assistant Superintendent, on probation, by name Babu Monmotho Nauth Chatterjee, has done his work well so far. 382. The appointment involves a certain amount of clerical work and book- keeping in connection with the Hostel and the Institution, besides the supervision of the students, their rooms, food, &c., and the purchase of the forage, &c., for the animals in the Institution. The incumbent should be a Brahmin and a man who can manage young men. 383. The Veterinary Overseer.( 29 ) 391.

THE following notes have been compiled to assist horse owners and others in appreciating the importance of glanders and farcy and to facilitate diagnosis and preventive treatment of cases. NATURE OF DISEASE. It should be clearly understood that although the words glanders and farcy (vernacular : penus and phuria) may be commonly used as if to define two diseases, both terms signify the same disease. Modern science has proved the diseases to be the same, though the symptoms are different. Glanders is a disease of equines (horses, donkeys, mules) which may be communicated to some other animals such as dogs, goats, guinea-pigs, and to man. It is caused by a micro- scopically small parasite called the Bacillus mallei. In this country, Glanders generally assumes a chronic form, that is to say, it develops slowly. Animals may be apparently healthy for a long time after they have become infected ; they may spread the disease to others without themselves being suspected. Sooner or later the disease becomes more active in the animal's system, and the patient presents certain clinical (visible) symptoms which will be described below. It is exceptional that a case of Glanders can be in a stable amid other occupants, and that they remain free from contamination. Some are almost certain to become glandered (or farcied) in their turn. The symptoms of Glanders may appear and gradually pass away, the patient may resume work, continue without symptoms for months, and again give indications of the disease. The old and debilitated are more prone to suffer from the disease than the young and vigorous. MODE OF ACCESS. Glanders spreads from stable to stable in two ways : (a) by the introduction of an infected horse ; (b) by the infection of one of the stud by some external agency. The germ which causes the disease is found in the discharges of infected animals, especially in the nasal discharges. Any means which will convey the germs from an infected to a healthy horse will convey the disease. Therefore, besides by actual contact of animals, the disease is spread by means of watering-troughs, mangers, food, pails, grooming utensils, surgical dressings, &c., &c. Even the air of an infected stable is not free from danger. PERIOD OF INCUBATION. Actual experiment has shown that symptoms may appear three days or more after infec- tion by inoculation, but the usual period of incubation seems to be about three weeks, although external signs may not be evident for three months, or even three years. The rapid development of Glanders (and also its spread) is facilitated by any debilitating influence afrecting the animals, such as bad stable management, had feeding, over-work, bad climatic conditions, chills, &c., &c.
( 21 ) SYMPTOMS OF GLANDERS. A well-developed case of Glanders shows the following symptoms :( 22 ) The following steps should be taken tinder paragraph 9, Act XX of 1879, India :( 23 ) APPENDIX XXIX.

Another Veterinary Assistant was required at the Bholka Tahsil, but no one was available. The Veteri- nary Assistant at Alipur after work- ing for a few days came back on leave and left his appointment "be- cause his wife was ill.' And before another Veterinary Assistant was sent, the Subdivisional Officer had telegraphed that the services of a Veterinary Assistant were not required. Darjeeling ... ... Ditto ... Ditto ... ...

Requested to send a Veterinary Assistant One Veterinary Assistant was appoint- ed and he succeeded in checking the disease. In November, a very bad type of rinderpest broke out in certain parts of the district, and another Veterinary Assistant was deputed for work during the outbreak. Bhagalpur ... ... Ditto ... Ditto ... ... April ... ... ... 3,740 1,912 51.1 Ditto ... ... ... ... ... ... Ditto ditto ... One Veterinary Assistant was sent. He had worked for a month only, when his services were dispensed with, though they were still requir- ed. The reason given was that a private Veterinary Assistant was in practice. I visited Bhagalpur in October 1897, and found that a native shop-keeper had assumed the title of Veterinary Surgeon, and had taken a Veterinary Assistant into his pay. This arrangement did not last long, because the Veterinary Assistant soon left ; but I understand the confederacy treat- ed one horse during its existence. Twenty copies of the rules for guid- ance in epidemics of rinderpest were supplied. Bhagalpur being a great cattle-country should have at least two Veterinary Assistants, especially as it is shown in the Gazette that disease prevailed for 41 weeks out of 52. Purnea ... ... ...

A Veterinary Assistant of this Depart- ment was sent on the 1st April 1897, who came back on the 9th May, after the disease had abated. Lohardaga ... ... Cattle disease of several descrip- tions, especially foot-and-mouth disease. Ditto ... ... May 1897 and January 1898. 7,116 353 15.06 Ditto ... Requested to send 15 copies of the rules for guidance in epidemics of rinderpest. Later on, expressed willingness to appoint a Veterinary Assistant, but could not for want of funds. 15 copies of the rules were supplied, drawing special attention to the chapter on rinderpest. The Deputy Commissioner ordered the Superin- tendent of Police to enforce the villagers to strictly observe, the rules. Palaman ... ... Fost-and-mouth disease and rin- derpest. Ditto ... ... Almost all the year through. 23,444 751i 3.2 Ditto ... Wished to appoint a Veterinary Assistant, but could not, owing to no funds being available.

Circular No. 6V.D., dated Belgatchia, the 29th December 1897. From( 29 ) 6. I have heard it stated that in outbreaks of cholera the ordinary routine is departed from, and that reports are sent direct from the thana to the Civil Surgeon and the District Officer. Herein, possibly, may be found a solution of the matter under consideration. There- fore I beg to ask( 30 ) No. District. Answer. 20. Mymensingh ... He has no objection. 21. Faridpur ... He has no objection, but makes the following remarks :( 31 ) No. District. Answer. 41. Puri ... States he has instructed the District Superintendent of Police to issue orders to the police officers in charge of thanas to submit reports of cattle disease through him and to send the report here in English, as most of the thanas officers do not know English. 42. Hazaribagh ... States the cattle disease reports should go through the district officers. 43. Lohardaga ... He strongly objects to any authority to report any matter except through the officers of their district. He sees no reason why outbreaks should not be reported by District Superintendent of Police who has been ordered to follow this procedure in future. 44. Palamau ... States orders have been issued to the police to report district out- breaks of contagious disease. 45. Manbhum ... He has no objection, if we are prepared to pay the postage on all such reports, as the police budget grant is too small to bear such charges. 46. Singhbhum ... He has no objection. APPENDIX XXXIV.

From information obtained from Judges of this and last year's fair, the animals were of a better class compared to last year. The ponies (Bhutia) from the general opinion expressed at the fair were not up to the standard of last year. I have had no opportunity of comparing this with other fairs. I should suggest that steps be taken to prevent the Government prizes all passing into the hands of one or two large dealers to the exclusion of the smaller ones, this as it was last year making the animals sell at a higher price, and practically excluding the smaller dealers from competition. 2 Iron grey ... 5 Gelding . ..

Small pony mares, as well as ponies of the size of 13 and over 13 hands, have been Served by the stallion. The produce of small pony mares below 13 is comparatively excellent, but the foals of the mares of 13 or of over 13 hands turn out excellent and valuable animals, especially those of well built mares, and consequently people of Gazipur, Ballea, and of the entire Shahabad district, who think of breeding bring their mares at a joint cost and trouble to themselves to be served by the stallion. Many of the foals, the produce of the stallion, were sold in last Berhampore Fairs, which are held in this subdivision, and though they were the produce of small little mares, still on acoount of their good structure and breed they fetched high prices. These mares and foals belong to his subdivision and this has still more stimulated the people to get their mares covered by the stallion. Similarly, the owners of the big and good mares have got excellent produce, and though they get high offers for them, still they are not parting with them. This is the best demonstration of the successful result of the working of the stallion, and this result induced many gentlemen of Patna, Ghazipur, Bellea and of this district to get their mares covered by the stallion. In short, the result of the breeding by the stallion is very successful." APPENDIX LIX.

During the year under report 80 cows were served by the bull maintained at the Khulna Jail and 100 by the other maintained at Morrelganj. The results of breeding in each case was successful. Mr. Deberium, of the mem- bers of the District Board living at Morrelganj, reports that the calves are too young, but later on, when they grow older, he will be able to judge if there is any improvement. The people seem to like the breeding. The Sitamarhi bull kept in the Khulna Jail was re- ported impotent in 1896. I visited Khulna on 17th December 1897. The Assistant Jailor showed me an animal which, he said, was the Sitamarhi bull, but it did not present the charateristio type of the breed at all, and appeared to be in a state of semi-starvation. The jail cattle did not appear to be well attended to. Ditto ... ... ... 3 Ditto ... ... November 1895 ... Are let loose among the herds at Dum-Dum.

November 1895 ... Ward's estate, Chittagong ... This bull is being maintained at the estate of Fazalali Khan under the charge of general manager, Wards' estate, Chittagong. The general mana- ger, reports that though duly appreciated by the people, the bull is unfortunately reported not to be so good for breeding purposes. Only 17 cows are reported to have been covered by it during the year 1897-98, and of these five have given birth to calves stouter and healthier than those of local breed, and the rest are in pregnant state. The bull is not let loose, and in comparison with the local ones it is, no doubt, some- what fat, but since the latter part of the year it is becoming little thin and betraying more inclination to cover cows. Paddy, straw, oil-cake and bhusi are given for its food. I have explained to the manager that it is a mistake to keep Sitamarhi Brahmini bulls constantly tied up and highly fed. They are accustomed to wander about, and therefore require some kind of exercise. I may add that I have seen in Chittagong plenty of bulls that were bigger than, and quite as sturdy as, Sitamarhi bulls. Many goalas in Chittagong keep good bulls. Ditto ... ... ... 1 Ditto ... ... 1896 ... ... ... Landholder Bosonti ... The zamindar, Babu Bhola Nath Ghosal, reports that several cows have been served by the bull, but as it is let loose among the herds the exact number of covering cannot be given. Six calves, the progeny of the bull which he has seen, are reported to be stout and healthy. This is another well-made bull, but too small. Ditto ... ... ... 2 Ditto ... ... September 1895 ... Collector of Birbhum ... ...... .... .... These two bulls wore objected to by the people because they were too small. The Raja of Hitampur voluntered to take them, and his manager has been asked about them, but no answer has been received. Ditto ... ... ... 1 Ditto ... ... Burdwan Pala Farm ...

This bull was returned to the Bengal Veterinary Insti- tution by the Assistant Director of Land Records and Agriculture, Bengal, under whose care it was maintained at the Burdwan Pala Farm owing to its unpopularity with the raiyats. It has not covered any cows since its return here. Too small for improving the local breed. Ditto ... ... ... 4 Ditto ... ...

During the year 1897-98 32 cows belonging to the jail were served by the bull with the result that 14 brought forth healthy calves, 112 are bearing, and 6 apparently have failed to bear. Only 14 cows belonging to outsiders were served by the bull, and the result thereof is not known. The bull is a success. One of bis sons was sold through this Department to the North Sankara estate, Damka, and I have no doubt will do well. Do ... ... ... 3 Do ... ... ... February 1897 ... Sitamarhi ... ... ... The subdivisional officer reports that out of the three, one was sent to Mr, H. E. Crowdy of Belsandh Factory, other was bought by the Raja of Parsauni, and the third was kept at the Sitamarhi Veterinary Hospital. 1. Mr. Crowdy reports that the bull is very much appreciated by the villagers. He has served 42 cows, and there are uplto date ten calves by him. The calves are very fine. 2. The Raja of Parsunni reports that the bull was kept tied up for several months, through fear of his straying, and he was out of condition, and could not cover any cows, but since these last 12 .months he has been let loose, and has served two cows only. The people like him very much. 3. The bull at the Sitamarhi Veterinary Hospital has served six cows, one of which has given birth to a she-calf. The number of cows served, by him is Small, as he was lost for seven months in Nipal. During that period he is said to have served good many cows, but nothing is known for certain about this. The bulls are a success now. I should be glad to learn that bulls 2 and 3 had more practice, as these animals are just as likely to become lazy Coverers from too little as from too much serving. Do ... ... ... 1 Do ... ... ... Ditto 1891 ... Krishnagar Jail, Nadia ... The Superintendent of the jail reports that the bull is not totally impotent. He takes long time in covering cows. Several local cows were covered during the year under report, and the result of breeding was succeess- ful. The people like this bull. I have seen this bull and a son of his by a good cow. The bull is a fine animal, but as it is reported to be impotent, it baslbeen sent to Belgachia, where I hope to render him serviceable. Do ... ... ... 1 Do. ... ... ... Ditto 1886 ...

The bull has become rather old and exhausted, but the people of the place like to have their cows covered by the bull. Too fat.
( 54 ) APPENDIX LXII. Note on Sheep and Goats in Bombay by Mr. J. W. Mottison, Deputy Director of Agriculture. I DO not think any of the indigenous breeds of sheep of the Bombay Presidency are likely to prove of much value in improving the local breeds of Bengal. The Deccani sheep are probably most extensively bred. They are owned extensively by professional shepherds who with their flocks wander all over the plains in the fair season, but retire to the higher and drier grazing grounds in the monsoon. This breed in flocks of any size does not remain healthy in the plains during the monsoon. These sheep require dry grazing ground in the monsoon or comfortable shelter at night during heavy rain. The necessary shelter can only be arranged for with small flocks. Sheep owned by villagers are sheltered in the houses or out-houses, but each owner has only a very few sheep. The Deccani sheep are of all colours, many black, some brown, some with broken colours and few white. The wool is coarse and hairy, the fleece light. Picked specimens are of fair size with nicely balanced well shaped frames on short legs with fine bone. The ewes milk well, and not only feed their lambs but are regularly milked by the professional shepherds, the milk being used for butter and ghee making. Veterinary Captain Morgan had a select flock of white Daccani ewes which he crossed very successfully with the Dumbha ram. In the cross-breed the abnormal tail of the Dumbha quite disappeared. The half-bred sheep were very shapely and with careful feeding matured and fattened rapidly. The wool was of fair quality and the fleece fairly heavy. Veterinary Captain Morgan fed his young sheep up to heavy weights and was offered twenty-five rupees each, for all young sheep up to a certain weight by the chief butcher, of the Crawford market, Bombay. The conditions under which Veterinary Captain Morgan's flock was managed were very favourable. The she9p were grazed on the Cantonment grazing. The land being light and naturally well drained, the rainfall at Ahmednagar is light. The fleck was sheltered in a shed during rain and had a big, naturally dry paddock to lie in over night in fair weather. The same cross in the Poona District on heavier soil with a heavier rainfall has not been so successful as at Ahmed- nagar. The sheep are quite healthy in the fair season, but are not satisfactory during the rains. The Dumbha Deccani cross was decided failure on the Khandesh Farm. There, however, the land is deep black and therefore unsuitable for sheep breeding. Veterinary Captain Morgan tried other crosses but all were unsuccessful. Australian Southdowns and other Australian breeds were found quite unsuited to the Deccan. Raj- putana sheep (which as 1 saw them at Ahmednagar were leggy and flatsided, but with a nice quality of white wool) did not thrive at all in the Deccan and the cross-breed lambs from them were also unsatisfactory. The only other breed of sheep of any importance that we have in the Presidency is that of Gujarat These sheep are big and upstanding with loose wool of fair length and quality. The wool is mostly white. Almost all the sheep of this breed have black or red, brown heads the colour of the head extending a short distance along the neck. Those sheep with brown heads have wool with a tawny or khoki tinge usually. The head is large and coarse, so also are the leg bones and feet. The breed lacks the shapeliness of the Deccanis, At the same time I have seen particularly five specimens, beautifully proportioned in every way. The sheep I particularly refer to are or were owned by rich Muhamniadans' families at Rander near Surat and were kept as household pets and could not readily be bought at any price. The goats of Lower Sind are for meat purposes, far superior to anything we have in the Presidency Proper. Those found generally throughout the Deccan are extremely leggy and unshapely. The Surat goat is a distinct breed, confined almost exclusively to the Town of Surat. This is a small goat, very compact and shapely with small bones and feet. This is a noted milk breed and on account of its value in this respect many are bought in Surat and taken to all parts. In the Arab stables in Bombay, exceptionally good imported milch goats are usually bought. These are usually white or tawny yellow in colour, with long hair and a beard. Those imported are no doubt select specimens. They have large wide deep frames on short legs with rather coarse bone. In India the feet of these goats soon get out of shape and become affected with foot rot. APPENDIX LXIII. Note on the chief breeds of Sheep in the Madras Presidency by the Principal, Saidapet College of Agriculture. Nellore.( 55 ) Mysore.( 56 ) 4. The officers of the Remount Depot have received instructions on this subject from their own Department and the following arrangements, which are in accordance therewith, were agreed to by Veterinary Lieutenant Martin. In the case of horses landed at the Depot, Lieutenant Martin will examine them after landing and will segregate all those which are found to be infected. The latter whether intended for sale to Government or to the public, be detained in quarantine at the depot until free from infection. Lieutenant Martin does not anticipate any objection to this on the part of the dealers, but if they should object, he expects to overcome their objections by threatening as an alternative to put the whole shipment into quarantine. As regards fodder, Lieutenant Martin proposes to require it to be landed at the depot, and if any case of infection is found onboard the vessel, he will prevent any of it from being removed from the depot. 5. Lieutenant Martin also agreed to inspect any cattle that may be landed at the depot and to deal with them, mutatis mutandis, as with horses. 6. As regards horses and cattle which are not landed at the depot, it has been usual to allow them to be landed in anticipation of the issue of a regular Customs pass. For the future I propose to withdraw this privilege in the case of vessels bringing live-stock of which any part has come from Queensland. Live-stock from such vessels will in future not be allowed to pass until they have been inspected by a Veterinary Officer either on board or at the Jetties as may be found convenient in each case. I propose' to ask Veterinary Captain Raymond to make these inspections if he is able to do so. Vessels with live-stook of which no part has come from Queensland will discharge as at present. It will be understood that the remarks in this paragraph apply only to those vessels with cargo from Queensland which do not land their live-stook at the Remount Depot. Cases of the kind will probably be rare. 7. The only point that remains is in connection with stable fittings. Horses are not usually landed at the Remount Depot, and Lieutenant Martin was apparently unaware that they are imported at all. This, however, is the case, and it is necessary to provide for their inspection. In the case of vessels which discharge at the Remount Depot I propose to ask Lieutenant Martin to inspect them on board, which can bo done after the animals have been landed. In other cases I propose to ask Captain Raymond to inspect them at the time when he inspects the live-stock on board the vessel or at the Jetties, as the case may be. 8. It does not appear possible to utilise the services of the Port Health Officer. The above arrangement appears to be the best that can be made under present circumstances. APPENDIX LXVI. Under existing arrangements vessels which bring horses from Australia, whether for sale to Government or to the public, usually land the animals at the Remount Depot at Garden Reach. Horses intended for sale to Government are stabled in the dept, whilst those meant for sale are marched from Garden Reach to the dealers' yards. Besides these there are racers and other horses imported for private persons, and not for sale. These latter are usually brought up to Calcutta and landed either in horse-beats or at the Jetties. 2. It has now been decided in the case of horses landed at the depot that a Veteri- nary Officer shall examine them after landing. He will segregate all those which are found to be infected, and whether the latter are intended for sale to Government or to the public, he will detain them in quarantine at the depot until they are free from infection. 3. Fodder arriving with horses that are landed at the Remount Dept will also be landed there, and will be subject to examination by the Veterinary Officer. If any case of infection is found among the animals on board such vessel, or if the fodder is itself found to be infected, the fodder will bo detained in dept, and shall not be removed therefrom without the permission of the Veterinary Officer. 4.As regards horses which are not landed at the dept, it has been usual to allow their discharge in anticipation of the issue of a regular Customs pass. I now withdraw this privilege in the case of vessels bringing live-stock of which any part has come from Queensland. Live-stock from such vessels will in future not be allowed to be landed until the animals have been inspected by a Veterinary Officer either on board or at the jetties, as may be found convenient in each case. 5 On the arrival of such a vessel notice shall immediately be sent to the Civil Veterinary Superintendent at Belgatchia, requesting to attend for the purpose of making the requisite inspection. Any fodder brought by such vessels will be similarly examined and inspected by the Civil Veterinary Superintendent. Vessels with live-stock of which no part has come from Queensland will be allowed to discharge them as at present. C. Stable fitting for horses or cattle when imported by a vessel which lands her live- stock at the remount depot will be inspected on board the vessel by the Veterinary Officer of the depot. When they are imported by a vessel any part of whose live-stock cargo has come from Queensland, and which has not discharged at the remount dep6t, they will be inspected along with the live-stock and fodder on board or at the jetties, as the case may be, by the Civil Veterinary Superintendent, Belgatchia.
( 57 ) In both cases Preventive Officer on board will prevent the landing of the stable fittings except under the orders of either the Veterinary Officer at the Remount Depot or of the Civil Veterinary Superintendent, Belgatchia. 7. The above procedure with respect to horses will apply also to cattle. 8. The earliest possible notice shall henceforth be sent by this office to the Superinten- dent of the Remount Depot, Garden Reach, of the impending arrival of a vessel from Australia with horses or cattle, with such details as may be known with regard to the date and hour of the vessel's arrival in port, the name of her agents, the berth or moorings at which she will tie up, the number of horses or cattle she is bringing out, and the port or ports at which these were shipped. 9. The arrangement detailed above will take the place of that described in office order No. 845 of the 1st October 1897. APPENDIX LXVII. No. 1463( 58 ) APPENDIX LXVIII.
