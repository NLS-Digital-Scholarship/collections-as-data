REPORT ON ENTERIC   FEVER.
?Sanitary Department. FROM        DEPUTY SURGEON-GENERAL HEWLETT, C.I.E., Sanitary Commissioner for the Government of Bombay, To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Military Department. Camp Poona, 10th September 1883. SIR, I have the honour to submit to you, for the information of His Excellency the Right Honourable the Governor in Council, a report of my proceedings with regard to the special duty Government was pleased to appoint me of investigating into the causes of enteric fever at stations occupied by British Troops in this Presidency. 2.    On receiving Government Resolution, Military Department, No. 2852, dated 30th March 1882,  containing letter No.   1122, dated 15th April, from the Surgeon-General, Her Majesty's Forces, in which he expressed his opinion that this enquiry should not be commenced before October, I brought  to his notice that it was extremely desirable that it should be undertaken during the rainy season, and he was  pleased to recommend Government to accede to my request: but I was not relieved of my duties as Deputy Surgeon-General, Sind District, before the 12th August, when I proceeded to Bombay and Poona, and by the end of the month to Mhow, where I was present during the latter end of the rains. 3.    From Mhow I went to Indore and thence to Neemuch; but a few days after my arrival there was suddenly recalled by telegram from the Surgeon-Gene- ral to Poona to take charge of the office of the Sanitary Commissioner.  Whilst at Mhow I was accompanied by the Travelling Water Analyst, whose services had been kindly placed at my disposal by Mr. Lumsdaine, but his appointment was shortly afterwards abolished by order of the Government of India, and he had to return to Bombay.    On representing, however, that I urgently required him to accompany me to the various stations, the Government of India was pleas- ed to accede to the request of the Government of Bombay that I might be allowed to retain his services for the purposes of this enquiry, and in November he followed me to Nasirabad and afterwards proceeded to other stations. 4.    From Nasirabad I visited Mount Abu, Deesa, Ahmedabad, Baroda, and returned to Bombay in December, and then went back to Neemuch, from which place I returned for a few days to Mhow and then proceeded to Asirgarh, Ahmednagar, Poona and Kirkee, Stra, Kolhpur, and Belgaum, and returned vi Poona to Bombay.    I have thus visited all the large stations occupied by British Troops in this Presidency with the exception of those in Sind (with which I was intimately acquainted) and Aden. 5.    In the commencement of this enquiry I saw that in reality it opened up the whole question of the sanitary conditions affecting the soldier from the time he leaves England and demanded a consideration of all the circumstances under which he is placed in India, and as a preliminary step I thought it would be useful to submit reports on certain Cantonments (Nasirabad, Neemuch and Mhow) to illustrate the effect local conditions exert in their relation to disease. 6.    The etiology of enteric fever in India is at present so enveloped  with doubt on points of cardinal importance, which must be worked out by skilled pathologists before any definite conclusions can be arrived at as to the exact conditions necessary for its production, that I cannot hope that the  report which I now have the honour to submit will do more than indicate some points which I believe are especially prejudicial to health and which it must be admitted powerfully predispose the young soldier to the attacks of disease, whether it be enteric fever or other disease.

2 7. All sanitary experience goes to prove that the pollution of buildings, earth, air or water is among all communities the most active source of disease, and there is accumulative evidence to show the danger of dampness in and around inhabited buildings, of foul dampness in the subsoil, of impure water and food, of air blowing over a foul population group, &c. In short, wherever we find these or similar infractions of well established sanitary principles we may predicate that as certainly as day follows night there will be disease and death. The surest preventives of disease in the Army as one of our greatest sanitary authorities has recently said "are to remove healthy troops from affected loca- lities and to put the earth, air, water and buildings into a healthy state." Money, and much of it, will be required for this purpose, but until such action is taken, year after year regiments will suffer from preventible sickness; and there will be annually a large expenditure for the maintenance of sick, as well as of healthy soldiers. Would it not be cheaper in the long run, wiser and more humane, to lay out money in the first instance so as to render our small army as healthy as possible, and to reduce the number of men constantly sick to some much smaller ratio than at present obtains ? I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, T. G. HEWLETT, Deputy Surgeon General, Sanitary Commissioner.

?REPORT ON ENTERIC FEVER.  CHAPTER I. As this report will be submitted to unprofessional readers, it may perhaps be as well to give a brief description of enteric fever and to explain shortly what are the current opinions as to its causation. The following definition of the disease is taken from Dr. Aitken's Science and Practice of Medicine (7th edition):- "A continued specific fever having an incubation period of about two weeks, with an eruption on the skin of isolated, elevated, rose-coloured spots, chiefly on the abdomen, appearing generally from the seventh to the fourteenth day, occurring in crops, each spot continuing visible about three days and vanishing on pressure. Languor and feebleness are prominent from the first, attended by headache, abdominal pains and (early) by spontaneous diarrha; but absolute prostration does not come on till late, the patient rarely taking to bed before the seventh or tenth day. With the advance of the disease the diarrha increases, the discharges being for the most part liquid, copious, of bright yellow colour, devoid of mucus, occasionally containing altered blood. In reaction the discharges are alkaline, and contain a large proportion of soluble salts with some albumen. The fever may terminate favourably by a gradual resolution to health during the fourth week. The average duration of the illness is about twenty-three days. Death in the majority of fatal cases occurs towards the end of the third week. There are special symptoms sometimes associated with the characteristic lesion of this fever, namely,-fulness, resonance and tenderness of the abdomen; more or less tympanites, with gurgling in the iliac foss; and increased splenic dullness. The specific lesions are enlargement of the spleen and the mesenteric glands with enlargement, ulceration and sloughing of the glands of Peyer and the minute solitary glands of the small, and sometimes also of the large, intestine.-Aitken." One theory which is accepted by many medical men at home, on the Continent, and in America, is that enteric fever belongs to what Lieber- meister calls "the Miasmatic Contagious Diseases", and that it is caused by a living particle or low organism which possesses specific characters and which never originates spontaneously, but only from some preceding case of enteric fever; and that without the introduction into the body of such specific living particle, or low organism, enteric fever cannot result. Much diversity of opinion exists as to the exact nature of morbific conta- gia, as will be seen by the following extracts from Dr. Aitken's work :- "With regard to the acute specific diseases there are two pathological theories to be noticed, each of which has been the subject of much contention, namely,-the theory of a ' Contagium Vivum' and the 'Germ Theory'-two theories so closely associated in the minds of many persons that they sometimes seem to be regarded as identical. In reality they have no necessary connection with each other. The expression ' Contagium Vivum'. is meant to designate the doctrine that when a contagious disease is communicated by the atmosphere, by personal intercourse, or in any other way, that conveyance takes place by specifically endowed organisms, which stand in a similar relation to the disease to that in which the seed does to the plant. For just as the seed is at once the origin and offspring of the plant, so according to this view the morbific contagium produces the disease and is in time pro- duced by it. This being understood, it is evident that the term contagium vivum relates exclusively to specific diseases and therefore mostly belongs to medicine. On the other hand, the germ theory teaches that certain organised and living particles, of extreme if not ultra microscopical minuteness, which are always suspended in the atmosphere are in such sense the causes of the suppuration and other destructive changes which interfere with the healing of a wound; and that (1) if these organisms are excluded, the wound must enter.at once on the processes of reparation; and (2) that if these organisms are present, it cannot so heal; and consequently that the whole secret of the successful treatment of wounds consists in the expulsion of that finest form of atmospheric dust which, whatever be the size of its par- ticles, has been identified as well by physicists such as Professor Tyndall and by mycologists such as Ngeli with the contaminating agents in question. Hence the germ theory, as it relates to the inflammatory and other consequences of injuries, involves questions which almost exclusively belong to Surgery, the object of surgical treatment being to defend the patient against the septic germ.-Burdon Sanderson." B 357-1
?2 "The one common property of the acute specific diseases is that they are all conta- gious, that is, from some part of the sick something is given off which can, when properly applied, excite the same disease in another, and which can excite no other disease. Little is known of what this something is ; and yet it is most important for the prevention and even for the treatment of these diseases that we should know. Little is known of those conditions of the system which render this something sufficient to the production of the disease in one person while in another it is inert. For example, at a certain time one of these diseases is what is called epidemic; scarcely a person who has not had it and is exposed to the emanations of the sick escapes taking it. On another occasion the disease is not epidemic and then many, with equal degrees of exposure, escape.-Sir W. Jenner." "The contagion therefore of this acute specific disease is something that is alive, something which exhibits the phenomena of growth and self-propagation; and the doctrine of a contagium vivum has been proven to be undoubtedly true as regards some contagious fevers. ' In an argument of this kind it is of capital importance to get hold of an authentic instance, because it is more than probable, looking to the general analogy between them, that all infectious diseases conform in some fashion to one fundamental type. If septic bacteria are the cause of -septicmia, if the spirilla are the cause of relapsing fever, if the Bacillus Anthracis is the cause of splenic fever, the inference is almost irresistible that other analogous organisms are the cause of other infectious inflammations and of other specific fevers.'-Professor William Roberts." "In regard to vaccinia, small-pox, sheep-pox, diphtheria, erysipelas and glanders, the virus of these diseases, it is believed, has been proved to consist of minute particles having the character of micrococci, and that in regard to typhus, scarlet fever, measles and the rest of the contagious diseases their connection with pathogenetic organisms is as yet a matter of mere inference.-Professor William Roberts." "Etiologists and pathologists have agreed to recognize one active principle which has essentially to do with the cause of propagation of disease, termed provisionally contagium or virus, which is believed to be contained in the secretions of the affected person. Beale's description of its material substance is the following:- "The minute contagious bioplast is less than the 1/100,000 of an inch in diameter and often so very clear and structureless as to -be scarcely distinguishable from the fluid in which it is suspended. Such a minute particle may readily be transferred from the affected organism to an apparently sound organism. It may be carried a considerable distance from its source without losing its marvellous power of causing in the organism invaded a series of changes resembling, and often in every minute particular, the phenomena which have occurred in the organism from which it was derived. And it is established that there exist different kinds of contagious living bioplasts, each capable of occasioning specific phenomena which distinguish it. The poison of small-pox will produce small-pox, not typhus fever, or measles, &c.; nor will any of these produce small-pox. Without, therefore, pretending to identify the actual particles of the living bioplasm of any contagious disease, or to be able to distinguish it positively from other forms of bioplasm, healthy and morbid, present in the fluids on the different free surfaces, and in the tissues in such vast numbers, I think the facts and arguments I have advanced prove (1) that the contagious virus is living and growing matter; (2) that the particles are not directly descended from any form of germinal matter or bioplasm of the organism of the infected animal, but they have resulted from the multiplication of particles introduced from without; (3) that it is capable of multiplying and growing in the blood; (4) that the particles are so minute that they readily pass through the walls of the capillaries and multiply freely in the intestines between the tissue elements or epithelial cells; and, lastly, that these particles are capable of living under very different conditions; that they live and grow at the expense of different tissue elements and retain their vitality although the germinal matter of the normal textures, after growing and multiplying to a great extent, has ceased to exist.--Beale on Disease Germs." Some pathologists contend that infectious diseases depend on bacteria; but although there is no doubt that they are found in the blood in many fevers, yet that they are the causative agents of disease is said by others to be open to the gravest doubt. Dr. Lewis' researches on this question, published in the Report of the Sanitary Commissioner with the Government of India for 1877, are very important, and are described by Dr. Cuningham as " a valuable contribution to the literature of the obscure subject of the origin of epidemic diseases." He arrives at the conclusion that these microscopic organisms have no specific action in the causation of disease but are rather to be regarded as epiphenomena. Enteric fever is not believed to be contagious in the sense that small-pox is, and it is stated that there is little danger in admitting patients suffering from this disease into the wards of a general hospital. The morbific contagium is supposed to be contained in the stools of the patient, and Aitken says:-"These dischar- ges drying up the germs of the disease are thus preserved as effectually as the crusts of small-pox preserve the virus of that disease ". In this way, according to those who believe in the specific contagium theory, the disease is spread; for, as
?3 Liebermeister says: "When typhoid fever is once establised in any locality, it may disappear for a long while and then suddenly reappear without the introduc- tion of a new case." Infection, says the same author, "can be produced by the air we breathe and the water we drink". The usual modes of propagation are thus given by Aitken:- "By percolation through the soil into the wells which supply drinking water to the inhabitants; (2) by issuing through defects in the sewers into the air of an inhabited area; (3) by exhalation through the aperture of small ill-trapped water closets or privies which are at once the receptacles of the discharges from the sick and the daily resort of the healthy; (4) by overflow water-pipe connections between drinking water cisterns and the drain; (5) by contamination of milk from a polluted water source." Other medical men, however, are not satisfied with the hypothesis that every case of enteric fever is of specific origin, and hold with Murchison, who, in his great work on continued fevers, lays down that it may originate spontaneously or de novo, and that " enteric fever is traceable to air or drinking water polluted with the products of decomposing sewage or other forms of putrefying animal matter". This is known as the Pythogenic (Filth-begotten) Theory. Dr. Murchison makes the following remark, which is very valuable to sanitary officers in India:- "In connection with the discussions which have taken place on the origin of enteric fever it is not immaterial to observe that there is an analogy on many points between enteric fever and diseases acknowledged to be malarious: a, the prevalence of both varies with season, temperature, &c.; b, recent residence predisposes to both; c, both only prevail under certain known infractions of sanitary laws; d, the quality of the poison varies with the locality. The varieties of small-pox and scarlatina can be proved to be due not to any difference in the quantity or the quality of the poison, but to the varying constitutions of the recipients. On the other hand, the varieties of malarious remittent fever are due in a great measure to the dose of the poison or the locality where this has been generated, and the same remark applies to enteric fever. "The etiology of enteric fever may be thus summed up:- 1. Enteric fever is an endemic disease, or its epidemics are circumscribed. 2. It is most prevalent in autumn and after hot weather. 3. It is independent of overcrowding and attacks the rich and poor indiscriminately. 4. It may be generated independently of a previous case by fermentation of fcal and perhaps other forms of organic matter. 5. It may be communicated by the sick to persons in health; but even then the poison is not like that of small-pox given off from the body in a virulent form, but is developed by the decomposition of the excreta after their discharge. 6. Consequently an outbreak of enteric fever implies poisoning of air, drinking water, or other ingesta with decomposing excrement." Dr. Richardson, one of the greatest living authorities on hygiene, dissents entirely from the germ theory and contends that "the poisons of the various communicable diseases are modified secretions, and thus, though products of living organs, are not themselves living but really dead matter, and that different diseases are caused by secretions of different glands ". In his report on the sanitary condition of Brighton, published in the Lancet of November 4th, 1882, he says:- "There is a dispute among the learned regarding the nature of the exciting organic particle as to whether it be living or dead, or whether it comes from without or from man himself. It is sufficient for the present practical purpose to know that the particle is necessary as a factor in an epidemic outbreak; that, as a rule, to which there are few exceptions, it passes from affected persons, and in those who are susceptible to it, it produces disease if it reaches them. The particle is absorbed by the susceptible; it is, as it were, planted in them; and after a certain definite period, called the period of incubation, it causes in them phenomena or symptoms which are the same as were presented in the person from whom it was derived." And, again:- "The disease called typhoid fever is one of those affections which can be conveyed extensively by food or drink in any community after the accident of its introduction and in ignorance of its danger. The organic exciting particle or poison of typhoid is usually, and as many think always, conveyed by fluids taken into the body as drink. The poison may possibly be conveyed for a short distance by the air; but so little is this event feared, that in some hospitals for the sick typhoid patients are allowed to remain in the general wards separated
?4 from the other patients by the mere distance of one bed from the other. If by accident the excretions from the typhoid patient were to find their way into the water or milk or other uncooked food or drink supplied to the other patients, the outbreak of typhoid fever would be certain and general, however pure and good might be the surrounding air; but under less exposure to danger no evil would accrue." Dr. Harley in Reynold's System of Medicine reviews what he terms- "the associated pathology of enteric fever, meaning thereby a comparative view of the development of the particular intestinal lesion in other acute diseases-an investigation of great importance in the comprehension of the relation of acute diseases generally, but one of especial value in the elucidation of the nature of enteric fever. Enteric fever is asso- ciated with the following diseases:-Pneumonia, pleurisy, laryngitis (rare), scarlatina and diphtheria, erysipilas, myelitis, phthisis, endemic intermittent and remittent fevers, dysentery, cholera and scurvy. After the foregoing review can we adopt the dogma of Chomel-Quand nous trouverons dans les auteurs, soit anciens, soit modernes, des observations de maladies aigues a la suit desquelles, on aura rencontre de ulcres a la fin de l'intestine grle, nous aurons le droit de les considerer comme des cas d'affection typhoide; or, going to the other extreme, shall we deny the existence of enteric fever as a specific disease and regard the intestinal lesions merely as the result of an accidental but severe local complication which may arise in any general febrile condition of the body ? If we accept the first proposition we must include tuberculosis under enteric fever; if we adopt the second, we may, with about equal reason, deny the existence of scarlatina as a distinct disease. We can only avoid the dilemma of admitting that the enteric disease and all its attendant phenomena may occasionally become a part of some other more general inflammatory condition, and then, I think, it can hardly be denied that in other cases the disease is due to some poison or poisons introduced from without, in the elimination of which the digestive organs especially are deranged. In order to include all the phenomena of enteric fever I find it necessary to divide it into these three varieties: (1) Simple Inflammatory Enteric Fever, (2) Contagious Enteric Fever, (3) Paludal Enteric Fever. "It may seem paradoxical and unphilosophical to include under one kind contagious and non-contagious diseases; but since the question of contagion is still an open one with many, and neither symptoms nor anatomical lesions mark a distinction, we must be content thus to classify the disease at present:- "(1). Simple Inflammatory Enteric Fever.-This variety is non-contagious, due to no specific cause, and may arise in any inflammatory condition of the body. such as acompanies pneumonia, erysipilas, pymia. The common enteritis which constitutes antumnal diarrha if protracted, often lapses into this variety of enteric fever. The recognition of the intercurrence of enteric inflammation with ulceration of the glands of the ileum in acute diseases generally is of very great importance. The frequency with which the intestinal glands become implicated in acute disease is probably due to their exposed situation, their delicate corpuscular structure, their great vascularity, and the arrangement of their blood vessels. We shall have little or no difficulty in distinguishing a tubercular ulcer from any other; but between the lesions assumed to be characteristic of enteric fever and those arising from ordinary inflammation, which of course may affect the intestinal glands in common with every other part and organ of the body, there is, I conceive, no distinction. "(2). Contagious Enteric Fever.-Of this variety I can say but little. I am not sure I have ever seen it, but that it exists, appears to be an indisputable fact. Eight of the sixty-eight patients referred to below came from houses in which other residents were affected with the fever. The disease may have been propagated by contagion in some of these cases; but in two instances, in each of which three members of the same family were affected, I found, from personal observation, that an endemic cause existed in impure drinking water. The associations of this variety appear to be with scarlatina and malarial affections, diphtheria and croup exudations upon the faucial and laryngeal mucous membrane appear to be more frequent in this variety, and the course of the disease more rapid than in the third variety. "(3). Paludal Enteric Fever.-This we believe to be the common form of the disease. It arises from putrescent animal and vegetable substances. It is non-contagious, and its course is usually slow. In thus unreservedly recognizing the connection which I cannot doubt exists between intermittent and enteric fever, it may appear to some that I transgress the facts which have been adduced to illustrate this view; but I feel sure justice has not been done to the numerous observations which abound in medical literature and which, if collected, would together form irresistible evidence of the direct connexion between the two diseases." In America the association between remittent and enteric fever is acknow- ledged:- "Not only, says Dr. Austin Flint, may the former present typhoid phenomena or the typhoid state, but the diseases occur not unfrequently in combination. This statement
?5 embodies an opinion held for a long time past by practitioners in malarial sections of this country, and the term 'Typho-malarial Fever' has been introduced by Dr. J. J. Woodward. "Typho-malarial fever is caused by the combined action of malaria and the special cause of typhoid fever. Practitioners in malarial situations have been accustomed to say that remittent becomes converted into typhoid fever. This mode of expression is not accurate. There is not a metamorphosis of the one disease into the other, but a combination of both diseases, the phenomena of the one or of the other disease predominating in different cases. Typho- malarial fever is not a distinct type of fever. It is, however, of great importance to recognize the combination of typhoid and of malarial fever. "Cases of typho-malarial fever occur in most, if not all, malarial regions. This fact shows that the special cause of typhoid fever is not held in abeyance by the prevalence of malaria and produced only after the latter disappears. The extinction of malaria is followed by cases of unmixed typhoid fever, and hence it has appeared as if the latter follows in the wake of periodical fevers. Simple remittent or typho-malarial fevers prevail especially in the autumnal season. Persons of all ages are liable to be affected by simple remittent fever. There is no evidence that this fever is ever contagious, nor that the malarial poison producing it is portable. "Typho-malarial fever is discriminated on the one hand from simple remittent fever by the characteristic events of typhoid fever, namely,-the abdominal symptoms, the eruption in some cases, the earlier occurrence of ataxic phenomena, epistaxis, and, occasionally, intestinal perforation. It is discriminated on the other hand from unmixed typhoid fever by the characteristic events of periodical fever, namely,-remissions, gastric symptoms, jaundice, and the eventuation in some cases in intermittent fever.-Austin Flint's Practice of Medicine, 5th edition." Turning to India we find, although, from the description of cases given by Annesley and other authors, enteric fever must have existed in their time, yet it was not recognized as a distinct disease before 1853, when it was described by Assistant Surgeon Scriven of the Bengal Medical Service as occurring among Europeans and afterwards by Dr. Ewart as being met with among natives of India (Sir J. Fayrer Croonian Lectures). The disease as a causeof sickness and mortality among British Troops in India was first brought into prominent notice by the invaluable writings of the late Dr. Bryden, who, from his position as Statistical Officer attached to the Sanitary Commissioner with the Government of India, had unrivalled opportunities of studying disease causes as they affect not only the European but also the Native Army of India as well as the jail and general population, and to whom we are indebted for the most comprehensive information on the subject which he has embodied in his well known statistical tables. In the Vital Statistics of the Bengal Presidency for the 10 years, 1860-69, Dr. Bryden says:- "The continued fever from which boys die is in almost every instance true typhoid fever. Although it occurs in every month, it is in the hot months that three-fourths of the deaths from typhoid fever occur. The typhoid lesion is the characteristic of the fatal fever of the unacclimatized, and the phenomena of the fever are those of true enteric fever. It is not only among the boys that this fever becomes developed, young men up to 24 are equally liable to suffer, and cases will be found pretty numerous among men of the 3rd group; and occasionally the fever is seen even in men above 30. "The fever from which the young men die is a fever of the hot season. My experience of the statistics of new troops leads me to draw the inference that the typhoid lesion is in almost every case present when the continued fever of the hot season proves fatal to the young. "I wish to express the practical truth that every body of young men which comes to India may be expected to suffer from typhoid in the first hot season not because of a special poisoning derived from the locality in which it may be placed, but because in the young when the influence of heat tells on the nervous system, infiltration in Peyer's glands follows, the characteristic eruption is manifested, and the fever pursues its course and ends in resolu- tion or in death. "Let me repeat that I know of no single circumstance that could suggest to me that the type of the fever is determined by local causes. Typhoid has no geography, and it is of universal occurrence. But in making this broad assertion I would not be misunderstood; that there is a zymotic element developed in every individual case of typhoid I believe to be a fact, and a truth that should be acted on in any case as soon as typhoid makes its appearance in a body of men. "A further theory suggests that typhoid may be acquired from contagium from the native population. I know of no single record of the existence of typhoid among the native B 357-2
?6 population. In the records of the Native Army I do not know of a single death attributed to typhoid which is not open-to suspicion that it has been wrongly diagnosed or carelessly returned."                          Again, in his report bringing up the Statistical History of the European Army in India to 1876, Dr. Bryden says:- "The sudden change to a tropical climate causes in the young and weakly-constitutioned the infarction of the intestinal glands which results in this fever of three weeks' duration. Why the glands fill up and whence is derived the material which accumulates does not fall to be considered here. On the statistical data given I hold every body of men coming from England liable to the attack of this enteric fever, and the question to be determined by the sanitary officer is how this liability shall be obviated or lessened. I need only repeat the general assertion that certain localities will be found more suitable than others for new troops in respect to enteric fever. After the 20th April in any locality too much care cannot be taken of new regiments, for it is in this week that exposure is very certain to be followed by the appearance of the fever; and, again, the tendency of the fever to reappear towards the close of the monsoon season must be kept in mind. Above all it is for the sanitary officer to determine whether the individuals first affected may originate an outbreak in the community. The tendency of regarding this theoretically as a purely climatic fever is apt to lead one to the extreme view that fevers of this class are not communicable from man to man. Judging from the mere aspect of such cases as those of the 36th, 2/22nd and others, I should feel much hesitation in subscribing to the theory of non-communicability; and while admitting that, as a rule, the cases are isolated and the facies of an outbreak entirely wanting-outbreaks which it is impossible to refer to any mere general influence, do occur. Witness the outbreak in the E/Battery of the 4th Brigade stationed at Neemuch in 1876. The battery had no enteric fever up to the last week in-August; throughout September eight cases and five deaths occurred, and again in November a sixth fatal case was developed. These cases were out of a body of 150 men who had been 18 months in India. That some local cause originated or aggravated this fever it is impossible to doubt. With the proper appreciation of the large body of facts regarding enteric fever in India now aggregated, we are not driven to the resource of finding in every case a local reason for development; and that contagion is contracted through intercourse with the native community is a suggestion warranted by no facts showing the presence of the fever among the general population with which I am acquainted." In the Report of the Sickness and Mortality of the European Army in India during the 10 years' period, 1870-79, which has been lately published by Surgeon-Major Stephen, the successor of the late Dr. Bryden, heat is again stated to be the probable seasonal cause of enteric fever to which the local causes are subordinate. The literature on the subject is very voluminous, and there are many valuable reports published in the Annual Reports of the Army Medical Depart- ment expressing the views of most experienced and able officers in that Depart- ment or connected with it. I need only refer to the annual reports on Hygiene by the late Dr. Parkes and Surgeon-Major DeChaumont, the Professors of Hygiene at Netley; the reports on enteric fever by Surgeon-General Ker Innes, C.B., in the volume for 1878, and that by Brigade-Surgeon Marston in 1879, the latter being very valuable and suggestive. There are also the most instructive and practical memoranda issued by the Army Sanitary Commission and the reports by Surgeon-General Gordon of the Madras Army; but one of the latest additions to our knowledge on the subject is Sir Joseph Fayrer's work on the Climate and Fevers of India, published in 1882, who says:- " It is said by some writers that enteric fever is a common disease among the natives of India; by others, that it is almost unknown. I think there can be little doubt that it is common enough. The causes which influence the European equally affect the Native, and unless it be a race peculiarity, there can be no reason why the Native should suffer less than, the European. I think that under certain circumstances Natives and Europeans are both affected by fever with enteric symptoms. It is by careful study of such outbreaks of isolated cases as regards the locality, water, sanitary conditions, previous history of the sufferers and their personal attributes, age, race, temperament, time of year, &c., that we may hope to discover the true causation. " But while the returns of the Sanitary Commissioner, the statistics of the hospitals, and other reasons place the existence of this form of fever among Natives beyond question, the etiology is still uncertain. My own impression is that it may depend on specific organic poisoning, but I doubt if this can be limited to human excreta, and believe that miasmatic poisoning may give rise to continued or continuo-remittent fever which becomes practically indistinguishable from specific enteric fever. That enteric fever should have one specific form in temperate climates is no proof that it may not have others in the tropics.
?7 " I think I have cited evidence to show that in the opinion of many medical officers of experience ulceration of the small intestines and Peyer's glands is not necessarily indicative of specific enteric fever, but may also occur in the climatic fevers of remittent and continued type. I believe a considerable amount of climatic fever occurs in the tropics in which the symptoms and phenomena so closely resemble those of true enteric fever that they may cause one to be mistaken for the other, and that the post-mortem discovery of ulceration attests the severity of the disease; but this does not proclaim its original cause. All I have said indicates the existence of fever which is neither simple continued, ordinary remittent, nor specific enteric, and that it should stand apart, its affinity being with malarial rather than with true enteric fever, though it has much in common with both. It may, after all, turn out to be true enteric fever; and were it admitted that the specific form of fever may originate in animal effluvia and emanations generally, and is not restricted to a specific contagion developed only in human excrement, then it is probable enough that in such a source we may find its origin, for there are few localities in which organic emanations do not taint the air, or pollute the soil or water; still the fact that these conditions are often rife, and yet this form of fever so infrequent, whilst the effects of season, locality and age play so important a part in developing it seems to show that climatic conditions are largely concerned." Brigade-Surgeon Marston, quoted by Sir Joseph Fayrer, says:- " On the whole, I think as a tentative and working hypothesis there are two forms of it in.India which cannot, however, be clinically or pathologically differentiated: One (the larger class) which does not depend on the contagion of any specific poison generated in the intes- tines of one person and conveyed to another through some vehicle, nor induced in any fcal poisoning or poisoning of any kind unless it be that the patient is autogenetically poisoned by his own fcal matters; the other occurring in outbreaks (not singly in isolated cases) and with a history by which the cases can be traced to some common cause, such. as infection, fouled air or water, diseased or tainted meat, &c. These attacks occur in communi- ties at one and the same time, or following one another quickly among men of the same corps and placed in the same conditions, and the ages and length of tropical service of the men are often very different to those of the other variety. Occurring under the circumstances stated, age and service are indifferent elements; within the limits of a soldier's age any man may be atacked, though the young and recently arrived are more predisposed. In the first variety, however, I am disposed to think that climate, meaning by it the whole combination of changed physiological conditions environing the young and newly arrived soldier in this country, plays a very important if not the main part." I have given the above extracts in extenso in order to show Government the very great diversity of opinion that exists amongst eminent members of the profession at home and abroad as to the origin and causation of enteric fever, and whilst so many points of cardinal importance remain undecided, it is evident that only opinions can be formed in favour of one theory or the other which would be unsafe to trust to for practical action.
8 CHAPTER II. I had hoped to have obtained all the information I required regarding the prevalence, &c., of the disease among British troops in the Bombay Presidency from the records in the office of the Surgeon-General, Her Majesty's Forces, but as they have been prepared according to the forms laid down by the War Office, I found that it was not possible to extract from them all the information I needed, such as the age, total service, period of residence in India and in the station, &c., of each man admitted into hospital with the disease; whilst the record of deaths prior to 1877 does not show the date of admission into hospital. Neither was I able to extract the monthly distribution by corps in stations, as the weekly returns up to the end of 1880 have, I am informed, been eaten by white- ants or destroyed. There is also no record to show from what barracks in each lines at each station cases of enteric fever have been admitted, nor is there any information available to show what effect sleeping on ground-floors as compared with upper stories has had on the health of the British soldier, or whether cases of enteric fever have been more frequently admitted from the one set of rooms than the other. I was therefore obliged to apply to the Sanitary Commissioner with the Government of India for as much information as he could give me, and the tables with which he has kindly furnished me, although not quite as full or complete as I had asked for, still contain very valuable information. Table No. I. has been compiled from tables forwarded by the Statistical Officer and from those contained in the Annual Reports of the Sanitary Commissioner with the Government of India. The aggregate strength of the Army  for the 10 years' period is taken from the tables showing the strength as it stood on the 1st July of each year. It differs slightly in this statement from the aggregate strength shown in Table VI. which has been compiled from the Annual Reports at the close of the year. TABLE No. I.

?9 The above table shows the distribution according to age of the aggregate strength of the European Army of Bombay during the 10 years, 1872-1881. The percentage to strength of each age being as follows :- Ages. Under 20. 20 to 24. 25 to 29.  30 to 34. 35 to 39. 40 and upwards. Total. Percentage   to   aggregate strength 4.05 35.95 31.55 15.95 10.25 2.25 100.00 The number of deaths from the principal causes at each age period and the ratio of deaths per 1,000 of strength of each age and the ratio of liability in percentages are also given. The total number of deaths and the percentage of deaths from each disease to total deaths being as follows :. Diseases. Cholera. Enteric Fever. Other Fevers. Apoplexy. Delirium Tre- ments. Dysentery and Diarrhoea. Hepatitis. Phthisis Pulmo. nalis. Heart Disease. All other Diseases. All Diseases. Number of deaths in 10 years 160 246 109 173 14 179 176 97 84 392 1,630 Percentage of   deaths   from each disease to total deaths. 9.82 15.09 6.69 10.61 0.86 10.98 10.80 5.95 5.15 24.05 100 Not only does enteric fever cause more deaths than any other disease, but no other disease is nearly as fatal. As has been noticed by every observer, enteric fever in India chiefly attacks young'.*persons and is most fatal at young ages, 64.22 per cent, of these deaths having occurred in young men under the age of 25. This is in accordance with the experience of the disease in all parts of the world. Murchison says :. Persons under 30 are more than four times as liable to enteric fever as persons over thirty. He gives the following useful table derived from 5,911 cases admitted into the London Fever Hospital showing the percentage at each period of life :.    Years of Age. Per cent. Under 5 years                     0.98 From 5  to 9  9.44 10  14 18.16 15  19 26.86 20  24        19.69  25  29 10.15 30  34 5.36 35  39 3.40 40  44         2.09 45  49         1.08 50  54 .60   55  59 .33 60  64         .33 65  69 .08 70  74 .00 75  79 .03 Ages not specified 1.30  1 B 357.3
?10 " From this table it appears that nearly one-half (46.55 per cent.) of the cases were between 15 and 25 years of age and more than one-fourth (28.58 per cent.) were under 15 ; less than one-seventh (13.3 per cent.) were above thirty and only one in 71 exceeded 50." This susceptibility on the part of the young is by some ascribed to the physiological activity of the solitary and agminated glands during youth and adolescence, and it is a point of great importance. No information is avail- able in regard to age and length of service of cases admitted into hospital ; but it will be noticed that whereas the ratio of cases in England between 15 and 25 years of age was 46.55 per cent., in the Bombay Army the ratio of deaths at the same ages was 64.22 per cent :- Table II., showing the number of deaths from enteric fever among the European troops serving in the Bombay Presidency classified according to age and length of Indian service, embraces a period of only nine years (1873-1881) as there is no record of service in the year 1872, and it demonstrates most forcibly that recent arrival in the country is the second great predisposing cause of enteric fever. Whether this is synonymous with arrival into an infected locality is one of the points at issue. This experience is not confined to India, but has been recognized in-France, England, and elsewhere. Murchison adduces this fact as pointing to the dependence of enteric fever on some local cause to which in older residents the system has become habituated by long exposure, and considers that in this respect enteric fever resembles dysentery, ague and other malarial fevers. The table shows that out of 208 deaths from enteric fever during the nine years, 147 men died before they had been two years in the country. In the third year the deaths among men under 24 are still numerous ; but the marked decrease, as the period of age, length of residence, and of consequent acclimatiza- tion increases, will at once arrest attention :-  TABLE II.

Table III. shows the number of admissions and deaths from enteric fever in each month of the 10 years ending 31st December 1881 among the European troops serving in the Bombay Presidency, and it will be seen that ,it attains intensity especially during two seasons of the year, the first of which embraces the months of April and May, and the latter the months of August, September (when the maximum for the year is reached), October and November. The prevalence during the autumn accords with English, Continental and American experience, and from it the disease in America is sometimes designated autumnal fever.

In other words, in considering Table III. it must be remembered that the causes which produced this disease must, as regards many of the admissions therein shown, have been in operation during the month preceding that in which the admissions took place. . . Showing the admissions given in Table III. by the seasons into which Mr. Lumsdaine divided the Indian year, it will be found that they occurred as follows :-  Cold Season, 121 days. Hot and Dry 61 days. Rainy Season, 122 days. Hot and Damp, 61 days.  December. January. February. March. Total. April. May. Total. June. July. August. September. Total. October. November. Total.

Unfortu- nately the statistics showing the monthly distribution by stations and corps is not
?12 available before 1879 ; but Table IV. shows that the most numerous admissions during April and May did not occur in our hottest stations. It must also be remembered that showers usually take place in April and May, and the marked increase during the rainy and the hot and damp seasons seems to indicate that moisture in the soil and air as well as increased temperature is a necessary factor in the production of the disease :- Table IV.

?13      . CHAPTER m. The exciting causes of the disease next demand attention, and their consideration in reality opens up the entire question of the sanitary conditions which affect the soldier from the time he leaves England, as "it is necessary to weigh the circumstances under which he is placed and the influences which surround him, such as the climate, his age, service, duties, habits, water-supply, food and beverages, state of barrack and hospital accommodation as regards site, construction, &c., as well as the state of surface and sub-soil drainage, latrines, conservancy, bzrs, &c. The opening of the Suez Canal and the substitution of the Red Sea route for the longer voyage round the Cape has been attended with a certain amount of increased risk to the young soldier consequent on the more rapid transition from a cold to a hot climate. The soldier arrives in India during the cold weather and is at once sent up- country by troop train to Devlli and thence to his destination wherever it may be. Until 23rd April 1880 troops from England were disembarked at the Car- nac Bandar,-close to the point of discharge into the harbour of all the night-soil of Bombay. This place has been most wisely given up, and since September 1880 all the troops entering or leaving India disembark or embark at the Sassoon Dock at Lower Colba, where the sanitary arrangements for their convenience are carefully and efficiently supervised. I have no doubt that this change has already effected great good, as formerly, immediately on landing, the troops were at certain periods of the day exposed to a strong  faecal atmosphere and always to a more or less impure air. It is therefore in my opinion extremely probable that in former years many of the men attacked by enteric fever shortly after arriving at their station up-country contracted the disease at the Carnac Bandar. Some of the stations in the Bombay Presidency, such as Nasirabad, Neemuch, Mount Abu, Deesa, Karachi and Hyderabad are extra-tropical; but the main difference is that whereas Karachi and Bombay are on the sea coast, the remaining stations are inland. Belgaum, Kolhpur, Stra, Poona, Kirkee and Ahmednagar are situated on the elevated plateau of the Deccan and Mhow, Indore, Neemuch, Nasirabad and Mount Abu on the highlands of Mlwa and Rjputna, whilst Deesa, Ahmedabad Baroda and Hyderabad are on plains which are but slightly raised above the level of the sea. Climate. The following extracts from the meteorology of the Bombay Presidency by Mr. Charles Chambers, F.R.S., Meteorological Reporter to Government for Western India, give an instructive resume of the principal points regarding climate :- " Barometric Pressure. " The mean barometric pressure is shown for the stations of Belgaum, Poona, Bombay, Deesa and Karachi in the following table :- Stations. Belgaum. Poona. Bombay. Deesa. Karchi, Annual mean      27.323 27.856 29.839 29.507 29.874. Annual Variation. " In the next table we give excesses, for each station, of the mean barometric pressure in the several months above the mean of the year ; first, as deduced from observations taken daily at the hours 9-30 A.M, and 3-30 P.M. and secondly, after correction for the diurnal inequality at those hours.

The figures are all of similar form, having values near the maximum from December to January in the case  of Karachi, and for November to January at the other stations, and values near the mini- mum in June and July, and with gradual progressions from maxima to minima and from minima to maxima. " The range between the greatest and least monthly means increases with the latitude, and is about three times as great at Karachi as at Belgaum : its values at the several stations taken in the order of their latitudes, viz., Belgaum, Poona, Bombay, Deesa and Karachi, are 0.185, 0.273, 0.285, 0.476 and 0.555 inch respectively. Any influence that height of the station has upon the annual range-and we cannot suppose the pressure of a column of more than 2,000 feet in height to be exactly the same at all seasons-does not alter the order which the numbers follow as affected by change of latitude. " The following table exhibits the amplitudes of the oscillations of pressure in averages for the year and for the monsoon months :- Average Daily and Night Ranges of Barometric Pressure, or the Ranges between the A.M. Maximum and P.M. Minimum, and between the P.M. Maximum and A.M, Minimum for whole year, and for the months June to August.    DAY. NIGHT.  Year. June to August. Year. June to August.  Inch. Inch.

Comparing Bombay with Poona and Belgaum, we see that the absolute diurnal range is about as great on the Deccan plateau, at an elevation of 2,000 feet, as in the Konkan near the sea level, a fact which seems to associate this variation rather with the general ground level than with the mean sea level. "The next table shows for each month of the year the greatest and least values of baro- metric pressure observed at 9-30 A.M. or 3-30 P.M. at the several stations.  "It will be noticed that whilst the lowest minima occur at all the stations, with a scarcely perceptible exception at Karachi, in June, the lowest maxima occur with scarcely perceptible exception at Belgaum, in July. Generally the movements both of the maxima and minima are similar to those of the mean barometric pressure, the largest values occurring about the winter solstice and the smallest values about the summer solstice, with gradual intermediate progressions.

Thus the average temperature of the whole of the Konkan, together with  Gujarat and the Upper  Patti Valley,, is 80, of Hyder. abad in Sind 81, of the southern group of stations on the eastern side of the Deccan 81, and of the northern group 79.    The coast of Sind and   South  Mlwa have each a temperature of 76, North Malwa of 79, and the western  or ghat side of the Deccan of about 77.    For much the greater pa.rt of the year the large city of Ahmedabad has a temperature in excess of its locality.    This may probably arise from an obstructed circulation unaccompanied by any diminution of radiant heat received from, the sun ; or the conditions of life in a densely populated place may alone suffice to heat sensibly the great  body of superficial air which envelops them.    In the low region inland the variation of temperature with latitude is from December to January that which is general in the northern hemisphere where the sun's declina. tion is south, viz., a decrease with increasing north latitude.    In March, however, a circuit of maximum temperature has already begun to form in Gujarat ; the circuit extends northward/ its centre travelling northward at the same time till June when it has reached our  north. ern limits in Upper Sind.    There it remains till July and then  extends  and travels south. wards, reaching Lower Sind in  October and, in a contracted form, Gujarat in November ; here it first appeared on the sun's approach northward and here it vanishes with the sun's pro. gress southward.    From June to November the coast of the Konkan has nearly the same tem. perature in one latitude as in another ; but in the months December to April there is a consi. derable diminution with increase of latitude.    The temperature of the coast of Sind exceeds that of the Konkan in June and July considerably and in August and September sensibly, but in the remaining months of the year the coast of Sind is the cooler.    In the higher rgnons the Malwa plateau has a higher temperature in the north than in the south between March and November and the reverse condition between. November and March, whilst in the Deccan the eastern side shows a greater temperature in the south than in the north from February to April, but only the invariable  increase from  west to east in other months, and the west. ern side exhibits no decided indications of variation with latitude at any season. " Winds of the Presidency. " The direction of the wind at Karachi seems to be much influenced by the direction of the Mekran Coast, For eight months in the year, March to October, the prevalent winds reach Karachi from almost due west, that is, in continuation of the Mekran Coast line., and a wester. ly duration component exists in the winds of the preceding and following months, February and November, leaving only December and January with a small preponderance of'north.east winds. The mountains which abut upon the district to the north and north.east of Karachi also offer obstacles to the progress of the wind in that direction which are absent on the re. latively fiat course to eastward. " From May to September at Deesa and Baroda and from June to September at Ahmed. abad the .prevalent direction of the wind is from the south.west quadrant with a large south direction component. At Deesa from November to January, at Ahmedabad in November, and at Baroda in December and January the preponderance of the wind is from the north.east quadrant, and at Baroda in November from due east. "Both at Deesa and Baroda the change from the winter to the monsoon character is by a left.handed rotation of the wind with comparatively large" resultant duration coefficients, and from the monsoon to the winter by a right.handed rotation with relatively small resultant duration coefficients. The persistency with which the winds of Baroda yield a large east duration component from November to January may be due in some way to the proximity of the termination of the Vindya Mountains ; in this particular the winds of Baroda are at variance with those at Deesa, which yield a small east duration coefficient,
?17 " For the Mlwa plateau we have curves for Nasirabad, April to December ; for Neemuch, January to August ; and for Mhow, the full year. At these three stations, so far as the curves show, the wind is westerly from March to October and easterly from November to February, the maximum westerly coefficient belonging to the middle of the monsoon and the maximum easterly to near midwinter. But Mhow has also a considerable south duration component in all months except January, and on the other hand the monsoon winds of Nasirabad have an abnormal north duration component, being nearly due west instead of considerably south of west, as is the case at Neemuch and Mhow. " For the Deccan we have curves for the full year for Kirkee, Poona and Belgaum, and incomplete curves for Ahmednagar and Kolhpur. At all these stations westerly winds attain their maximum of duration in the middle of the monsoon, and so far as the curves show, easterly winds near midwinter. Generally the monsoon winds deviate but little if at all to the south of west. The months in which easterly winds prevail are at Kirkee, December ; at Poona, October to January ; at Belgaum, October to March. " Of the curves of the stations in the Konkan, that of Bombay is almost an exact counter- part of that of Deesa. The curves of Goa and Belgaum--the latter place about 50 miles to landward of the former and on the Deecan plateau-show that the same winds have the same degree of preponderance at both places in the months May to September, but for the remaining months of the year the prevalent winds of Belgaum have an east duration component. " At the hill stations both of the Deccan and Konkan and also at Kolhpur the monsoon winds are decidedly from the south-west and with large coefficients. The easterly winds of the winter have larger coefficients and prevail longer than in the plains of the Konkan ; and the extended prevalence is greater as we proceed eastward, for at Purandhar easterly winds prevail from October to April, at Mahbaleshvar and Mthern from October to January, and at Goa and Bombay only during December and January, Rainfall of the Presidency.

In the coast stations (Karachi and Bombay) the air is laden with moisture all the year round ; but in Malwa, Rjputna and the Deccan scorchingly hot and dry winds prevail during the hot season which, abstract a very considerable quantity of humidity from the air. The highest annual average humidity is found at Bombay, but in Belgaum it is very high,-in fact at that station the air during the months of July and August is within eleven points of saturation.

?18 Effects of Climate. The coast climates are warm and damp but equable, whilst the sea breeze, which in Bombay blows on the average for 18 or 19 hours every day, renders the effects of the high temperature less trying. In Karchi, which is beyond the tropics, the wind blowing off the sea though cooler than in Bombay, is equally laden with moisture, and, as in a warm, damp climate, perspiration is easily induced, the great liability to chills caused by checked evaporation from the surface of the body is one of the dangers residents in these stations have to guard against. "A hot, dry atmosphere is better tolerated than a damp humid one, because the hot, dry air favours evaporation and thus keeps the body cool, whilst in damp air as evaporation decreases, the natural cooling power is greatly diminished." It is from this fact that the climate in Bombay at the end of May and beginning of June is always so trying to European residents. There is some reason for believing that increased heat raises the tempera- ture of the body in men who have recently arrived in the country "probablybecause the evaporation from the skin is not capable of counterbalancing the great exter- nal heat. On the whole even when sufficient perspiration keeps the body temperature within the limits of health, the effects of great heat in shade seem to be, as far as we can judge, a depressing influence, lessening the nervous activity, the great functions of digestion, respiration, sanguification and, directly or in- directly, the formation and destruction of tissues. Whether this is the heat alone or heat and lessened oxygen and great humidity is not certain."- Parkes on Hygiene. Exposure to the direct rays of the sun, combined with excessive exertion, is supposed to be the cause of thermic fever, and, if prolonged, may induce insolation; whilst an excessive range between day and night temperatures is, by some authorities, considered to be sufficient to account for the phenomena we call fever. A writer in a recent article in the Quarterly Review says:- "Although the fevers which malaria produces are quite unlike the fevers that are conta- gious or communicable, the present scientific guides of the profession are resolved to find a material virus or poison as the cause of these. From 1849 to the present year some twenty vegetable organisms, or their spores of various degrees of complexity, have been described as the malarious miasm and as the specific cause of remittent and intermittent fevers, and the quest for a material substance assumed to be the cause of malarial fever is regard- ed with much favour in the best scientific circles. Meanwhile a body of opinion which takes due account of all the manifold associated circumstances of malaria throughout the world has been forming and yearly growing in volume that there is no malarious miasm at all; that 'malaria' indeed is a profound disorganisation of the nervous mechanism that presides over the temperature of the body; and that this upsetting of the heat-regulating centre is likely to happen when the body has been exposed during the day to extreme solar heat and to fatigue and exposed at sundown and in the night to the tropical or sub-tropical chill which will be severe in proportion to the rapid cooling of the ground and the amount of vapour con- densed in the lowest stratum of the air. There is no more beautiful mechanism in nature than that which keeps man's internal heat always about 98 day and night, summer and win- ter, in the arctic regions or in the tropics; but even that most wonderful of all self-adapting pieces of mechanism, if it be taxed too much, as by extremes of day and night temperature, will get out of gear and a fever, still retaining something of the diurnal periodicity, will be the result. No one can read the powerful criticisms of Surgeon-Major Oldham of the Indian Medical Service without discovering this rational explanation of malaria to have the best of the facts and the best of the logic on its side." Time can alone show the truth of this theory; but, in the meantime, from a sanitary point of view, it is most important to remember that the climatic con- ditions which obtain in India favour the decomposition of organic matter, whether in the soil, water, or air. Age. Section 18, para. 14 of the Queen's Regulations lays down that "no man is to be sent to the head-quarters of a battalion abroad until he has been thoroughly drill- ed and instructed in the use of his arms and has completed a recruit's course of musketry. The men are to be selected from the service companies according to the date of their enlistment, provided they are in all respects fit. Attention is to be paid to the age (which for India and other tropical countries should not be less
?19 than 20 years) and constitution of the men selected, so that the draft may consist of those best qualified to bear the effects of a change of climate. The Medical Officer is to be consulted in the selection." I made enquiries as to whether the above order is strictly carried out, and I was informed that no young soldier is sent out without having at least nominally passed his drill; but, I believe, as a matter of fact, the great majority of young soldiers have, on arrival, to undergo fresh instruction. I am indebted to the Adjutant General of the Army for the following re- turns. No. I. shows the strength of drafts that have joined their respective corps in the Bombay Command during each of the last 10 years. From want of data it is found impracticable to furnish the ages of the men included in this return, as their regiments have long since left the Command for England and elsewhere. No. II. shows the strength of drafts that have joined the corps now serving in the Command in each year since their arrival in the Bombay Presidency, giving their ages as far as available. From this it will be seen that of the 2,203 men whose ages are recorded, 508 or 23.06 per cent. were under 20 years of age:- " Return showing the Strength of Drafts that have joined the undermentioned Corps in the Bombay Command during each of the last 10 years.

CUNNINGHAM, Lieut.-Colonel, Poona, 28th September 1882. Officiating Assistant Adjutant General." Duties. The amount of work a soldier in India has to perform depends greatly on the branch of the service to which he belongs. In the Cavalry and Horse and Field Artillery his time is fully occupied in cleaning his horse, arms and accoutrements, and in the Garrison Artillery in attending to his duties; but the Infantry soldier after the morning parade has little or nothing to do and passes much of his time between meals in lying on his cot, smoking strong tobacco, or, if he goes out, in visiting the bzr and, too frequently, the prostitutes' quarters. This comparatively idle life is, in my opinion, one of the most potent causes operating against the general health of the Army. In some stations the Infantry soldier has more guards to keep than men in other branches of the service, especially night guards, and this in malarial stations, like Neemuch for example, undoubtedly exerts a prejudicial effect on the men as they are exposed, too often under existing arrangements with an empty stomach, to the ill effects of emanations from marshy land in the vicinity, fogs, &c., &c., as well as to cold winds which often suddenly set in during the night. The num- ber of nights in bed a soldier gets varies not only with the branch of the service to which he belongs, but also depends on whether there is a heavy sick list or not, but generally the privates get about 5 or 6 nights in bed. Sometimes, however, much less, for example, in Neemuch in September 1882 the men of the Royal Artillery furnished a barrack guard consisting of 1 corporal and 3 gunners and a stable picquet consisting of 9 drivers. In this battery the non-commissioned officers had 7 or 8 nights in bed, but the gunners only 3 and the drivers 3 or 4. The detachment of the Worcestershire Regiment at the same station fur- nished the fort guard consisting of 1 sergeant and 6 privates, the garrison cell guard with 1 corporal and 3 privates, and the quarter-guard consisting of 1
?21 corporal and 10 privates, and the non-commissioned officers of the detachment had 6 nights in bed and the privates 6 18/19. Owing to increased sickness the Artillery picquet was reduced by 3 men and the quarter-guard, Worcestershire Regiment, was increased by 3 men. Habits. On arrival at his station the young soldier at once finds himself under entirely new conditions to any that he has previously experienced. His quarters, his food, his dress, his duties, his amusements are alike strange. He too often ignores the danger of exposing himself to the sun, and will often wilfully, in spite of remonstrance, go out into it without his helmet, and on getting heated his first thought is to throw off his coat and sit or lie on his cot in the breeze until he gets cool. If he goes for a walk in the bzr or in the country, if thirsty, he buys beverages concocted with impure water or drinks water from any source, little caring whether that source is polluted; or if he goes to the Canteen to quench his thirst he can by regulation obtain as much of the dull, heavy and sometimes sour porter supplied by Government as he can pay for, provided he does not get drunk, besides purchasing, if he chooses, a dram of rum per diem. Few young soldiers can resist the temptation put in their way in the canteen; and the spirit ration is in my opinion a great cause of sickness in the Army, whilst the tobacco provided for the soldier is so strong as often seriously to affect his health. The men of the present generation seem to me to be more indolent than they were 30 years ago and not to turn out to cricket or other out-door games as readily as they used to do. In his person the soldier is not always as clean as is desirable; he washes the upper part of his body as a rule every day, but many men do no more perhaps for days together. If he visits the plunge- bath provided in most stations by Government, the chances are that the young soldier will, in spite of warning, stay in for too long a time. This practice is frequently the cause of congestion of the liver, and we had to stop the men of the 98th at Karchi visiting the plunge-bath whilst they were so sickly. Officers as a rule cannot stand the effect of a plunge-bath for any long period, and in some stations their use, I am informed, among officers has been given up. I regard the want of personal hygiene on the part of the young soldier as one of the most potent causes tending to lower his general health, and little good can, I fear, be expected until he is systematically taught how to take more care of himself. In the European Regiments of the H. E. I. C. Service the old soldiers used to look after the recruits and teach them what dangers to avoid, and thus they escaped many of the evil consequences which the young soldier of the present day brings on himself through ignorance. The following tables will give some useful information regarding matters bearing upon the health and habits of the soldier in India:- B 357-6 [Table]

Great and unceasing have been the efforts of Government and the Military authorities throughout the Presidency to improve and conserve the drinking water supplied to the troops, and immense advances have been made in this respect during the last 30 years. The source of water-supply at each station in the Bombay Command will be learnt from the following table :- Stations. Karchi. Hyderabad. Bombay. Baroda. Ahmedabad. Deesa. Mount Abu.  Trgarh.

His analyses of Mhow, Neemuch, Nasirabad and Ajmere have already been submitted to Government in my reports on the three first-named places.

The wells are for the most part sunk in the tertiary sandstone forming the old bed of the River Layri, and the water contains salts varying in quantity from 75 to 300 grains of solid matters, which consist for the most of the chlorides and carbonates of calcium, magnesium, and sodium. For example, the water from the well which supplied the Royal Artillery contained as much as 112 grains of total solids and 48.65 grains of chlorine per gallon, whilst that from the well supplying the Napier or Infantry barracks contained 79.1 grains of total solids and 29.4 grains of chlorine per gallon. It is necessary to mention that when the North Staffordshire Regiment became so sickly water from the River Indus was brought down from Kotri to Karchi for their use. This state of things is now happily at an end, as the Municipality have lately completed a scheme by which water is brought in from wells sunk on the banks of the River Mullir, at a distance of 10 miles from Karchi, from which the water is brought in through a closed conduit to a reservoir, from whence it is distributed to Camp and the Native Town. It is satisfactory to notice that this water is of good quality, as the sample from one of the wells yielded only 28.7 grains of total solids and 6.86 grains of chlorine per gallon. This amount of chlorine is high, but as it is derived solely from the saliferous nature of the rock in which the wells are sunk, it may be safely disregarded; and I have no doubt that the health of the troops will be greatly improved by the good water now supplied to them, although I regret to learn that it is not laid on to the barracks but only to stand pipes in the lines from which it is still distributed by the filthy musuck. I desire to call particular attention to the very large increase of albuminoid ammonia found in water from the Bhistis' musucks and in the filter tubs in the barracks. For example, whilst in the sample from the well supplying the Artillery it only amounted to 0.06 parts per million, that from the musuck and filter tub contained the very high amount of 0.15 parts per million. When, however, the water had passed through the Macnamara filter it was found that it had retained 2.4 grains of the total solids per gallon and had reduced the albuminoid ammonia from .15 parts per million to its original quantity, .06. The deteriorating effect of the musuck on water is also seen in the sample of Indus river water supplied to the Napier Barracks. Luckily the Macnamara filter efficiently removed these impurities.

The Analyst visited, and examined the water at, Baroda in August 1882 before he was employed under me, and his analyses are published in the report for that year. Nearly all the wells in the bzr were found to yield bad water. The salts in some of them exceeded 100 grains per gallon. The wells in the Native Infantry lines yielded good water, and of the five samples taken from the European lines three were good, one fair, and one bad; the latter being from the well opposite the Station Hospital which contained 73.5 grains of total solids and 9.1 grains of chlorine per gallon, and 0.106 parts of free ammonia per million. In Ahmedabad Camp 39 samples of water were examined, 18 of which were taken from the European lines, 10 being from wells there situated, the remaining being samples from the musucks, filter tubs, cook-rooms, &c. Only four of the 10 wells yielded good water, whilst from three it was classed as fair, and in the remainder as bad. The four wells were the following: (1) the well in the Com- missariat Cattle lines, from whence the water used in the bakery is obtained;
?27 (2) well No. 21 near the old Persian barracks; (3) the well opposite No. 1 barrack, Royal Artillery, and that (4) near the Station Hospital. Some of the wells in the Native Infantry lines in this station are very bad. For example, well No. 121 contained as much as 371.7 grains of total solids and 92.12 grains of chlorine per gallon, whilst the water from the river near the Sadar Bzr only contained 31.5 grains of total solids and 4.8 grains of chlorine per gallon. The ammonia determinations in the sample from the river were, however, higher, and render it a very unsafe water to drink :-   Date. Station. Source. GRAINS PER GALLON. PARTS PER MILLION.

The water is said to be of good quality, but as the wells are situated in the centre of the lines, there is some danger of its becoming contaminated, and the wastage water renders the ground in the vicinity of the barracks damp. The well from which the Artillery draw their water is too near the horse lines. In January 1880 it con- tained total solids 33.6 and chlorine 3.22 grains per gallon and free ammonia 04 and albuminoid ammonia .06 parts per million. Thirty-two samples of water were examined at Mount Abu. The well within the Railway enclosure at Abu Road Station was found to contain bad water, whilst that from the well near the Rest Camp contained 525 grains of total solids and 868 grains of chlorine per gallon, but as the ammonia determinations were low, it is classed as fair. The water in the well near the Rest Camp at Arna on the top of the ghat is of good quality, and that supplied to the troops at the Sanitarium is also fairly pure. The geological formation consists of granitic rocks, and therefore we might expect to find good water. As, however, the gathering ground of the well is partly inhabited, the greatest care is very properly taken to keep it as clean as possible. The well near the Dilvara temple de- mands particular attention, as the water in it is bad, the result,-in the opinion of the Analyst, with which I concur,-of the large amount of filth in its immediate vicinity caused by the large number of pilgrims who visit the temples and by their objectionable practice of bathing and washing their clothes round the well.

?30 At the hill Sanitarium of Trgarh the drinking water supplied to the con- valescents is obtained from the Doodea well in the city of Ajmere. The analysis published in the report on Nasirabad shows that it is a most unsafe drinking water. At Nasirabad the troops are at present supplied from two wells, only one of which is proved by analysis to contain good water. A reservoir, regarding which full details are given in my report on that station, has been constructed among the hills about five miles from the Camp, and although the water from it, owing to a large amount of vegetable contamination, is not at present fit for immediate use, I am confident when the filtering and storage arrangements have been improved that it will yield very good water. The inhabitants of the Sadar Bzr are at present solely dependent for their drinking water on diggies and surface wells, the water in which is simply sewage; and until the Danta Lake water, supplemented from the Bir tank, can be brought into the bzr, its condition must be a standing danger to the troops. The Analyst made a very complete analysis of all the waters at Nasirabad. At Neemuch the water-supply is solely derived from wells sunk in the late- rite rock. The troops obtain their supply from the hospital well, which contains water of good quality, but which is open to danger, as I have explained in my report on that station. The water in the wells in the Sadar Bzr at Nee- much is very impure and is a source of danger to the troops frequenting it. The analyses are embodied in the report. At Indore the water for the troops is obtained from a well sunk on the black cotton soil. As this is open and situated close to a public road, it must, at all times, be liable to pollution. At Mhow the water-supply is derived from surface wells, many of which are at a lower level than the barracks, and they are at all times liable to be contaminated by surface impurities. Full details regarding the water supplied to the troops and that used in the Sadar Bzr, which is most impure, will be found in my report on that station together with the analyses made by the Analyst. At Asirgarh the drinking water for the detachment is obtained from a well sunk on the banks of the Sukkur Tank. Drains have with great judgment been made to cut off water flowing over inhabited areas from finding its way into the drinking water-supply and to convey it into another tank at a lower level. The catchment area of the tank is formed by the parade ground and the greatest care is taken to keep this clean. The tank water is filtered through sand before it passes into the well, and the beneficial effect of this treatment in reducing the amount of organic matter is seen from a comparison of the water taken from the tank and that from the well:-    Parts per Million.

The water is said to be pure and wholesome, but to run dry during the hot weather. At Ahmednagar the troops are supplied with water brought into Camp through old native aqueducts from wells situated near the base of the surround- ing hills. The European troops obtain their water from the Bhingr and Sh- hpur aqueducts, but the latter source dries up during the hot weather. The water at each source is of excellent quality, as will be seen by the ana- lysis, which is as follows :-     Grains per Gallon. Parts per Million.  Total Solids. Chlorine. Free Ammonia. Albuminoid Ammonia. Bhingr aqueduct   168 091 000 004 Shhpur        182 100 000 004 The water from the Shhpur aqueduct flows into an open tank between the Infantry Barracks and the officers' houses, from whence it is drawn by Bhisties, whilst the Bhingar aqueduct supplies the Artillery Barracks. It is much to be lamented that water brought into Camp in a pure state should not reach the men in an equally pure condition but that its quality should be deteriorated by the objectionable mode of distribution, by leaves, dust, &c., blowing into the tank. As recommended in my report on this station in 1876, this tank should be covered and the water pumped up for distribution to each set of barracks. Another source of danger is that, the aqueducts on their way into Camp have been broken into by villagers, &c. This practice should be rigorously dealt with, as by it dangerous impurities may easily find their way into the water- supply.

At Poona the Khadakvsla Canal water, after it has passed through the set- tling tanks and filtering beds, is laid on to the barracks, and is excellent in every respect. There is however one point of danger connected with this free intro- duction of water into the lines, viz., that no channels have been made to convey away the wastage water from the ground below the water pipes which thus be- comes soaked. The unlimited use of water in the gardens, &c., throughout the Cantonment will infallibly be attended with an increase of malaria-producing causes, and in my opinion there will some day be an outbreak of fever in Poona which will compel attention to the necessity of providing a drainage scheme.

34 At Kirkee the drinking water is obtained from the pipe from the Pshn Canal; this is of good quality, but is said to become frequently turbid during the rains.

The men at the Sanitarium at Purandhar are supplied from wells. At Stra the water is obtained from a well near a nla. The land on the higher levels is highly cultivated and manured, and when the Khas scheme is completed, it will remove a source of danger to the troops. At Kolhpur the water derived from wells in the laterite is of good quality. At Belgaum the drinking water is obtained from wells sunk in the laterite. It is of good quality. At Aden condensed water is used by the troops for drinking purposes, of which three gallons per head is allowed. It is of course very pure, but being distributed in musucks, is liable to contamination. The analyses show that however good a water may be at its source, it is certain to become contaminated by the mode of distribution in force throughout the Presidency. In every station visited by the Analyst it will be seen how impure it is made by being conveyed in the leathern musucks used by Bhisties. They also prove the efficiency of the Macnamara filters in removing impurities from water. But too much reliance must not be placed on this, for sometimes the leaden delivery pipe from the filter gets cracked across, as I found in two instances at Mhow, and then the water is delivered straight from the tub without passing through the filter. There appear to be no rules laid down regarding the dates on which filters are to be re-charged or from the source the sand in them is to be obtained. These are much needed in my opinion.
?35 The analyses also prove that in every instance the water taken from the ghurrs, which the prostitutes are by order compelled to keep in their houses, was in every station most impure, and they also show how deleterious are the beverages usually sold to the soldier in the bzrs, and that as a rule the native population living in Sadar Bzrs or in native villages habitually drink impure water. Food. The insufficiency of the present authorized ration in India, especially for young growing soldiers, has lately been the subject of much earnest consideration and action on the part of the Military authorities and of the Government of Bombay, whose recommendations on this point, if sanctioned by the Government of India, will, without doubt, have the most marked influence in the preservation of the health of the men; and I may perhaps venture to say that I regard this action on the part of Government as the most important advance that has been made in matters affecting the wellbeing of the British soldier in India since the days of Lord Napier. The Army Sanitary Commission says:-"We welcome this expression of opinion as the first authoritative statement which has yet come to us from India on a subject which lies at the root of efficiency there." Under existing arrange- ments it is no uncommon thing, as pointed out by the Surgeon General, Her Majesty's Forces, for a soldier to go from the dinner meal at 1-30 P.M. one day to 8 A.M. of the following morning without any solid food in his stomach; and al- though in most regiments, I believe in all, men can obtain food which is served out just after going on night guard, they do not get what is so much wanted-food at mid-night-so that they are most liable to be attacked, if exposed to disease- producing causes, during the very  hours when the vital powers are at their lowest point of resistance. His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief, as stated in Government Resolution, Military Department, No. 166, dated 11th January 1883, concurs in opinion with the Surgeon General, Her Majesty's Forces, that the present scale of rations to European Troops is insufficient, and that an increase thereto is absolutely neces- sary to secure four meals a day to the soldier, viz:- A small meal before morning parade. Breakfast. Dinner. Tea or supper. I tried to find out how many men availed themselves of the coffee shops to buy extra food, but this information could not be supplied correctly. It is however certain that very many men do so, more I think in the Artillery than in the Infantry, probably on account of their heavier work; but it is equally certain that many men do not spend anything on extra food, but either save their money or spend it in liquor, &c. In order that there may be no doubt as to the correctness of the views of the Government of Bombay as to the insufficiency of the soldier's ration, I thought it would be well to ask the Chemical Analyser to Government to favour me with his opinion as to the nutritive value of the authorized ration, and to compare it with the scale allowed to men of the Royal Navy serving in the East Indies. The following letter from Staff Surgeon Ridout, R. N., H. M. S. Tourmaline, and the able report of Surgeon Milne, Acting Chemical Analyser to Government, will be read with much interest:-
36 "Tourmaline at Bombay, the 22nd of March 1883. SIR, In answer to your letter of the 5th instant (No. 53, 1883,) I have the honour to inform you that the rations supplied to men in the Royal Navy while serving on the East Indian station are precisely the same as on the Home station, in accordance with the following scale :- In Harbour.  Fresh Meat    Lb. 1 daily.  Vegetables     " 1/2 "  *Soft Bread    " 1 1/4 "   At Sea.  Salt Pork     " 1 "  with Split Peas   " 1/3 "  Celery Seed    As requisite  alternately with-   Salt Beef     Lb. 1 daily.  with Flour     Ozs. 9 "  Suet     " 3/4 "  Raisins     " 1 1/2 " except on every fourth day, when the following is issued :-  Preserved Meat   Lb. 3/4 daily.  with preserved Potatoes or Rice   Oz. 4 " Both at Sea and in Harbour.  Rum  Pt. 1/8 "  Sugar  Ozs. 2 "  Cocoa  " 1 "  Tea  " 1/4 "  Mustard  " 1/2 weekly.  Pepper  " 1/4 "  Vinegar  Pt. 1/4 " * The same quantity of biscuit in lieu at sea. When men are engaged on special duty, an extra ration of chocolate, or occasionally rum, is issued. On the recommendation of the Medical Officer, lime juice, oz. 2, is issued daily at sea. The following are the meal hours: - Breakfast (Bread and Cocoa) 6.45 A.M. Dinner (Meat and Vegetables, &c.) Noon. Supper (Bread and Tea) 4.30 P.M. N.B.-It is customary for men to save something from dinner to eat privately at a later hour. (2). With regard to alteration, I would recommend that an extra ration of soluble chocolate (which can be rapidly prepared) should be issued every morning, soon after the men turn out (usually 5 A.M.), that the breakfast hour should be 8 A.M. instead of 6-45, that supper should be at 6 P.M. instead of 4-30. The day would then be more equally divided. At present the interval between the 4-30 supper hour and the following breakfast is more than 14 hours, which is much too great. The new hours would be thus: - Early chocolate 5 A.M. Breakfast 8 " Dinner 1 P.M. Supper 6 "  I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) CHARLES L. RIDOUT, Staff Surgeon, R. N."
?37 "No. 16 OF 1883-84. Chemical Analyser's Office, Bombay, 5th April 1883. FROM THE CHEMICAL ANALYSER TO GOVERNMENT; To DEPUTY SURGEON GENERAL HEWLETT, ON SPECIAL DUTY, Bombay. SIR, I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 263 of 26th ultimo with enclosure from Staff Surgeon, Ridout, R. N., herewith enclosed, and beg to forward the following statements showing the nutritive values of the various articles of diet supplied to the British soldier in India and to the men of the Royal Navy serving in the East Indian station :- 2. DIET OF THE BRITISH SOLDIER IN INDIA. Nutritive Value in Ounces Avoirdupois and in 10ths of Ounces. Articles. Daily quantity. Water. Nitrogenous Substances. Fat. Carbohydrates. Salts.

In both the total nitrogen is deficient and is below the quantity in the standard average diet of a European which contains about 316.5 grains. Carbon is also below the average standard (4,862 grains). The proportion of carbon is too large for the nitrogen. Fat is very deficient, and all the carbon mostly is yielded by the carbo-hydrates and not by the fat. Diet would be improved by the addition of a small quantity of oil or butter with peas or beans. Accessory foods are deficient. Vinegar has been strongly recommended as an addition. The salts in the diet are sufficient. Greater variety is required for perfect health so as to suit the peculiarities in taste of the men. In India the diet is probably insufficient for even light labour and is altogether insufficient for soldiers undergoing severe exertion in the field.

38 Remarks.-In the above statement no extras are included with the exception of two ounces of sugar daily issued as such. Table salt (Na. Cl.) is not included, as the daily quantity was not stated in the table forwarded. The value of an infusion of tea or cocoa, &c., can-not be stated with accuracy, and a value has not been assigned in the statement. The sailor is better provided with accessory foods than the soldier. The diet in harbour requires more variation. Variety in the character of the food apart from the mere elements of nitrogen and carbon being an essential in alimentation. In the above diet for a man at moderate work carbon and nitrogen are both deficient. Fat is in very small quantity. Three ounces are necessary for even a moderate diet.

By a comparison of these amounts of carbon and nitrogen as measuring the chemical and physical values of foods, it will be observed that the Naval ration at sea is amply sufficient for all demands that may be made upon it under the most varying circumstances during service. The diet in harbour is on the
?39 other hand meagre both in carbon and nitrogen and is very deficient in fats, as seen in a preceding table. An average of the ' average diet at sea ' and of the diet in harbour would give the following results :- Nitrogen 362026 grains. Salts 530250  Carbon in Albuminates 1,224182  " Fats 1,230412  " Carbohydrates 3,263528  Total, Carbon 5,718122  The above results show a very good diet compatible with even hard labour. Considerable difficulty exists in calculating the nutritive values of salt beef and salt pork. As hyosin is largely soluble in a solution of chloride of sodium, it necessarily follows that a large quantity of this nutrient substance passes into the brine. Probably the albumi- nates in salt beef and the fat in salt pork are too highly estimated. In the analyses of peas some indigestible cellulose is not included in the table. The desiccated or preserved pota- toes are taken as equal to four times the amount of the fresh article. The sailor is better provided with accessory foods than the soldier, and his diet is taken on the whole much more varied and nutritious. In the Naval diet at sea the fat is not well distributed over the diets, but occurs in excess in those into which salt pork enters as a part. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, (Signed) A. MILNE, M.B., Surgeon, Acting Chemical Analyser." I quite concur with Dr. Milne in thinking that the soldier's ration would be improved by the addition of a small quantity of oil or butter with peas and beans, and I would urge that it should be made at least equal to the naval ration whilst at sea. I am quite sure we do not make sufficient use of the pulses, such as peas and beans. The concentrated pea soup supplied to the troops in Afghnistn known as Kopfs Erbswurst has the advantage of not only being an exceedingly nutritious and concentrated article of diet as described by Dr. Lyon in his eighth Annual Report, but it is very quickly prepared and very cheap. A tin of this served out to each man on guard at midnight with his coffee and biscuit would prove a most valuable addition, and I can testify from personal experience that it is very palatable and satisfying. I also think that it is most important that the hours for meals should be altered to those suggested by Dr. Ridout, as at pre- sent there can be no doubt that the soldier habitually goes too long without food. I must particularly notice as having a most important bearing on the parti- cular enquiry I have been engaged in, that on visiting each station of the Bombay Command I was particularly struck in finding among every corps, though to a greater extent in some than in others, men who presented spongy or bleeding, and, in some instances, ulcerated gums. Doubtless this unhealthy condition may in some degree with justice be attributed to the neglect of personal cleanliness on the part of the soldier, and it is much to be wished that a tooth-brush formed part of his kit. But after allowing to the fullest extent for this, I am most strongly of opinion that it is very largely due to a scorbutic taint throughout the Army. At Mhow I found that out of 626 men of the Lancashire Fusiliers examined 280 or 45 per cent. of the men had swollen spongy, and in some cases bleeding and ulcerated gums. It is right to say that all the Medical Officers at the Sta- tion Hospital disagreed with my view that this condition was due to scurvy, as they ascribed it to malarial cachexia ; but with all deference to their collective opinion, which I greatly respect, I still retain the conviction that it was due to scor- butus. I am confirmed in this opinion by finding that a man had been admitted into hospital before my visit with identically the same conditions, and in that case the disease was ascribed by the medical officer to scurvy ; and in former years it was well known that Troops in Malwa and Rajputana suffered from scurvy. I had been familiar with these appearances among the 98th at Karchi, and had seen them disappear under the continued use of lime-juice.
?40 This condition is not so bad except in a few cases as to attract attention, but it has a most important bearing on the question of enteric fever, as scurvy, it will be remembered, is one of the diseases associated with this disease, and its combination with dysentery in India is a point ever to be remembered. For these reasons I think that the vegetables at present supplied, viz., 12 ozs. of potatoes and 4 ozs. of onions, should be supplemented by an additional ration of 4 ozs. of green vegetables, such as cauliflowers, spinach, lettuces, or even bhji. Whilst the necessity for allowing a small quantity of vinegar has often before been urged, a larger quantity of salt would also seem to be desirable. The amount served out in some Continental armies is larger than in our own. "Our army is sup- plied with *5( = 1/2 oz.), the French 5, Prussian 87, Russian 187; but for a long time the Russian army had salt money given, and it was only when scurvy attacked them that the money was stopped and the salt given.-Squire." In connexion with the question of food it is necessary to urge that perhaps more stringent orders are required regarding the keeping of pigs in Cantonments. At Mhow there is a piggery establishment in the village of Pensionpoora, with- in Cantonment limits. This is, I quite allow, very carefully kept; but at Deesa Bzr I witnessed the following sight:- Whilst inspecting in company with the Cantonment Magistrate the tatties erected for the use of the inhabitants of the Sadar Bzr on the sandy banks of the river, I noticed a herd of swine rushing violently down a steep place into the enclosure where they greedily eat up the freshly-deposited human ordure. This practice had not been previously known to the Cantonment Ma- gistrate and was said to be of recent occurrence, and it has since, I believe, been stopped; but it must not be forgotten that, as Aitken points out:-"It is very probable that some of the so-called epidemics of typhoid fever in former days were caused by the propagation of Trichin in the human body". It may here be interesting to observe that an outbreak on board the Re- formatory Ship Cornwall was, as reported in the 9th annual report of the Local Government Board, 1879-80, attributed by the medical officer in attendance to enteric fever though its identity with that disease was afterwards disproved by Mr. Power, the Inspector sent down by the Local Government Board to enquire into the circumstances attending the outbreak. Mr. Power, as Dr. Buchanan says:- "Searching for direct post-mortem evidence of its nature found himself concerned with a parasitic disease in essential particulars resembling that produced in the human subject by the presence of Trichina. Some anatomical peculiarities of this Cornwall parasite (noted at the time by Mr. Power, but by him regarded as of no generic importance) tended to throw doubt on its identity with Trichina; but a further report on this subject by Dr. Bastian refers the parasite to the genus Pelodera, which has not heretofore been known to invade the human body." Dr. Bastian says:- "If future observations should confirm the view entertained by Mr. Power and Dr. Cory that such nematoids as were found in the body of the boy Pierce caused the malady from which he died and were causes likewise of the various other cases of febrile illness that occurred in epidemic fashion among the residents on board the Cornwall, the importance of this discovery will be increased rather than diminished by the fact that the nematoid in question is not as they at first naturally enough supposed Trichina Spiralis, but some hitherto unknown form producing a previously unrecognized disease whose clinical affinities are almost as strong in the direction of enteric fever as they are in that of trichiniasis. In this case we shall in future have to distinguish between two distinct fleshworm diseases in the human subject, the one caused by the Trichina fleshworm and the other by the Pelodera fleshworm. Peloderiasis would also be the name by which the new affection might be distinguished from Trichiniasis. "The mode in which worms of the latter class or their allies gain entry into the body would still remain to be determined." Dr. Bastian gives a caution, it is as well to remember in India, "against the eating of raw fruits or vegetables contaminated with such organisms or with minute slugs that may have swallowed them in addition to the drinking of unfiltered and unboiled water which may for some time have been stored in tanks or cisterns containing much organic sediment-a possible mode by which dwellers in towns or other communities might be infected. The young or the ova of particular free nematoids might from time to
?41 time (that is, at particular seasons or under particular conditions,) chance to be brought to such reservoirs in unusual numbers and they might then find conditions favourable for their still further multiplication, and if disease in man does not often result from such causes, this is probably to be ascribed to the general inaptitude of these free nematoids to take on this kind of accidental parasitic' existence rather than to the rarity with which they or their ova are able to gain access to the human alimentary canal." It is as well to record that in the genus Pelodera Schneider included three forms, all of which were found by him in damp earth and decaying substances. I made particular enquiries about the milk supplied at the barracks, hospi- tals and family quarters, and though it is extremely probable that it is fre- quently diluted with impure water, yet the women and children who consume much larger quantities than the men have not suffered very much from enteric fever; and this mode of propagation of the disease among the troops in India appears to be at all events infrequent, although perhaps the most common source in England. There is danger however in allowing the stable litter to be sold to owners of milch cattle. The position of the slaughter-houses is usually well selected; but the slaughter- house at Neemuch is only 70 paces distant from the trenches, where the night- soil of the native lines, officers' houses, and a portion of the Sadar Bzr is de- posited. The carcases hanging in the shed must therefore at times be exposed to a tainted atmosphere. The bakeries, too, are in my opinion not quite what they should be, though I quite allow the Commissariat officers keep a very strict watch over them. At some stations the bakeries are private property and the sanitary condition of the surroundings are too often such as should not exist near a place where bread is made. Even when every improved appliance has been provided by Government the natives will do every thing they can to spoil the best devised scheme. For example, the new bakery at Ahmedabad has been furnished with every appliance to secure cleanliness. Self-acting swing gauze doors have been fixed to each room to keep out flies; yet at the time of my unexpected visit I found the ropes attached to the door weights tied into knots, so that every door was open and the large masses of dough on the tables were simply black with flies. I found that Steven's dough-kneading machines are not in general use, and they appeared to me in some instances to have been wilfully broken. I believe there is an idea that they cannot be used with sooji, though it is admitted that they are serviceable with flour; but they were in use with sooji for many years in Colonel Dunsterville's time. The natives dislike them as they entail in- creased labour; but kneading with the too often unwashed hand is especially dangerous when one remembers the use the left hand of natives is put to, and to see the perspiration streaming off the naked bodies of the natives into the dough during the hot weather is sufficient to convince the most sceptical of the advan- tage of machine over hand-kneading. Barracks, &c. As a rule, to which however there are some exceptions, the barracks provided for British soldiers in this Presidency are very fine buildings. Indeed I cannot help regretting that so much money has been expended on some of them, because I think evidence is accumulating that sites and buildings after long occupancy become almost necessarily unhealthy, and that it would be cheaper and better to build barracks calculated to last about 20 or 30 years which could at the expira- tion of that time be pulled down without entailing any great loss on Government. Standard plans applicable to the whole of India from Cape Comorin to Peshawar are also, in my opinion, a decided mistake, as I think barracks should be designed with especial reference to the climate of each station. Compare, for ex- ample, the climate of Belgaum with that of Ahmedabad or Neemuch, Bombay, Karchi and Deesa, and yet the same standard plan is held to apply to each station. Then, again, as to the site of barracks. In some stations, as at Neemuch, Mhow, Deesa and Poona, some of the barracks have most unfortunately in my opinion been built close to the confines of the Cantonment and without reference B 357-11
?42 to the nature of the country beyond its limits. The consequence is that the jurisdiction of the Officer Commanding the Station ceases within a few hundred yards of the barracks and he is powerless to control the unhealthy conditions which may exist in their immediate neighbourhood but beyond the boundary, some of which are beyond practical remedy and all of which occasion a great deal of trouble and roundabout correspondence before they are removed or palliated. This radical error is aggravated in the first three stations named, inasmuch as the territory around each Cantonment belongs to Native States. Filthy villages exist outside but in the immediate vicinity of Cantonments, such as at Neemuch, Mhow, Deesa, Stra and Belgaum, where disease causes prevail without the possibility of removal or remedy, so that the air blowing over them is contaminated. Again, in many stations there is an area of marshy or sub-marshy land to windward of the barracks which is the cause of malaria. This is especially seen at Neemuch, Nasirabad; Poona, Mhow, Karchi, Bombay and Hyderabad. In some stations, too, as at Mhow, Karchi, Poona and Deesa, the Sadar Bzr is so placed that the air, passing over a foul population group, is blown into the  barracks. Then, again, barracks, as the Infantry Barracks at Nasirabad and the new CavalryBarracks at Mhow, have been built on sites which had been previously occupied for a long term of years by Native Regiments. With regard to the construction. Whilst admitting the great difficulty of constructing barracks which shall answer perfectly the requirements of the cold, hot and rainy seasons, yet I must particularly bring to notice that generally throughout the Presidency there seems to be a great difficulty in making the roofs water-tight and in preventing rain from beating into the verandahs. Such con- ditions I saw at Mhow during last September, and as noticed in my report on Nee- much I was informed by the Executive Engineer there and learnt from enquiries among the men that not only did the roofs leak and the rain beat into the verandahs, but the very walls of the dormitories were in some instances saturated with wet. I heard similar complaints of leaking roofs, &c., at Belgaum, Kolhpur and Stra. Another preventible source of dampness was invariably found in the leakage from the Macnamara filter tubs which are usually kept in the verandahs; but ground-damp, under and near barracks, is in my opinion one of the most fruitful sources of disease. The Royal Commission on the sanitary state of the Army in India many years ago laid down as the very first sanitary requirement of a healthy barrack in an intensely malarious country like India that there should be absolute discon- nection between the earth and the floors, and that all barracks should be built on raised basements so that there should be an air space of at least 3 or 4 feet between the ground and the floor This action has ever since been steadily insisted upon by the Army Sanitary Commission and by the Sanitary Comm- issioner with the Government of Bombay; but throughout the Bombay Presidency there does not exist one single barrack in which this most necessary recom- mendation has been carried into effect. In some of the older barracks, as at Nasirabad, Deesa, Ahmednagar, the wash-houses are under the same roof as the dormitories. At Ahmednagar the damp was seen to penetrate under the barrack- room and appeared on the wall of the plinth. Sufficient attention has not in my opinion been paid to the construction of im- pervious shallow drains to carry away the rain falling on the roofs. In some, as the old Cavalry barracks at Mhow, downtakes have been provided on one side of the roof, but on the other the storm water is discharged through spouts on to the ground. In many of the barracks there are no downtakes and the rain drips from the eaves. In most stations, with some exceptions perhaps as in Baroda, the sur- face drainage is so far sufficient that it removes the storm water so that it does not lie for any length of time on the surface; but it should ever be remembered that it can do no more than lessen the quantity of rain which sinks into the sub-soil. In no station is there any system of sub-soil drainage except in the Officer's lines at Ghorpori, where a patch of black cotton soil has been underdrained. The length of time that the sub-soil will remain damp is well shown by the diagram furnished
?43 by Major Gibbs and published in my report on Mhow. The amount of water passing through the sub-soil under the barracks and mounting by capillary attraction up into the solid plinths is a matter that in my opinion most seriously affects the health of the soldiers. As a rule barracks are not overcrowded, but sometimes owing to military exigencies overcrowding does take place; but this subject at all time engages the most careful and immediate notice of medical officers in charge of troops. The ventilation of the barracks in many stations is, during the monsoon, ex- cessive. If the doors are kept open, the men sleep in a draught and are liable to get a chill; if the doors are shut, they breathe the emanations from their lungs and bodies. What is required is that, fresh air should be admitted about half way up the wall, and such would be provided by the adoption of the door and window recommended by the Army Sanitary Commission and by Mr. Lumsdaine. The wastage water from the non-commissioned officers' rooms in barracks as a general rule is received into iron receptacles which either stand on the surface of the ground or are let down into a chunamed pit. Too often, either from the spout leading from the bath-room not being immediately over the centre of this receptacle or from the wind blowing the stream away, the water does not fall into it, but into the pit in which it stands. This wastage water is generally removed from the receptacles by puckauli bhisties by means of a dholl or tinpot, but a little always remains behind, and sometimes a not inconsiderable quantity. I have heard complaints that a smell from these receptacles sometimes finds its way into the rooms. The wastage water from the wash-houses, as at Nasirabad, is utilized in their immediate vicinity over gardens-a very dangerous proceeding with such a previous history as the sub- soil in the Infantry Lines at that station has. In other stations it is removed by puckauli bhisties and is either utilized for watering trees or is discharged into a nla. Dry earth is used in all latrines attached to barracks and hospitals, and the greatest care is taken throughout the Presidency to keep these places clean; but I cannot help regarding the standard latrines as a disease cause. Many are insufficiently ventilated, such as the left flank latrine at Ahmednagar, the Artillery latrine at Karchi, the Artillery latrine at Nasirabad, the heavy battery latrine at Mhow, and others. I think the iron pans in use are more than probable the nidus of disease. These pans are dammered inside and out and they present inequalities of surface which, in spite of every care on the part of the sweeper, it is simply im- possible to keep perfectly clean, and they retain particles of filth which cannot be removed. The same remark applies also to the iron urinal tubs, no amount of ordinary cleaning can remove the salts deposited on them. The use of dry earth by the men also is not habitual. Some do throw a scoopful of earth into the pan after using, but very many do not. On in- spection morning it was generally found that dry earth had been deposited in each pan, but very frequently a sweeper would be seen hiding himself from observation. On visiting the latrines at odd times without notice the use of dry earth by the men was found in some stations to be exceptionable. The greatest attention in this respect was observed at Belgaum in the regimental latrines of the Royal Irish Fusiliers where the Quarter Master, Captain Watkins, is very particular in seeing that they are kept as clean as it is possible to keep them. In each latrine the following notice is pasted up:- "The soldiers of the battalion are directed never to leave a latrine without throwing a scoopful of dry earth into the privy pan. The application of the dry earth must be imme- diate, and the Commanding Officer desires to impress upon the men the necessity for a strict observance of this valuable sanitary precaution. He hopes that it will be unnecessary for him to place sentries on the latrines to enforce this order." The night-soil and urine are removed from the latrines and urinals in closed iron tubs which are kept in a passage behind these privies. These, too, it is im- possible to keep thoroughly clean, and they are not inspected as often as the privy pans. In my opinion they are a source of great danger and very possibly the nidus of enteric fever. B 357\?\
?44 At most stations the night-soil is deposited in trenches, the site of which at Neemuch is only 600 yards from the hospital, in the direction from which the wind blows during the cold weather; but generally speaking the site of the trenches is a safe one as regards the barracks, though, as at Mhow, they are not always safe as regards native villages, public roads, &c., in the neighbourhood, or, as at Baroda, where the manure yard adjoins the Sadar Bzr. The removal of the solid refuse from regimental lines is as a rule extremely well carried out, but its mode of disposal is as objectionable as the massing of the night-soil in pits; for, as at Karchi, Neemuch, Belgaum, &c., it is collected in heaps which slowly undergo decomposition. Bzrs. The bzrs are in my opinion, almost without exception, in an unsatis- factory state from a sanitary point of view. I readily acknowledge that with the limited means at their disposal the Cantonment Magistrates do all they can to keep them clean, but the radical defects as regards regularity with respect to houses, the entire absence of any proper sewerage system, the dangerous cesspools in use, the faulty latrines, the large number of animals that are allowed in them, &c., &c., are of such magnitude as to render their efforts nugatory. The soldier most especially frequents the lowest quarters where the brothels are situated, where he is exposed to many temptations, for convenient- ly near the prostitutes' houses are generally to be found vendors of spirits, soda- water, ginger pop, and such like beverages. The prostitutes, who are recruited from the lowest castes, almost invariably live in dark, damp, and badly ventilat- ed houses. There is not unfrequently a privy or a cesspool close by, and the man, often half drunk, sleeps on a cot within a few feet of it. By the rules the prosti- tutes are compelled to keep water for ablution and drinking purposes in their rooms, and the analyses of the water found in such places show how impure it invariably is, as also how deleterious are the beverages usually sold in the bzrs. I regard the prostitutes' houses as hotbeds of diseases other than Venereal complaints. The drainage of bzrs is, I have said, most imperfect, and though, as at Nasirabad, Neemuch and partly at Mhow and in other stations, en- deavours are being made to improve them in this respect, it will take much time and more money before they can be considered even approximately safe in this respect. I have therefore no hesitation in saying that men predisposed by youth and recent arrival are exposed to danger in frequenting the bzrs, whilst the sanitary state of native villages in the immediate neighbourhood of Canton- ments is much worse; for, when these are situated in foreign territory, no attempt is made in the direction of sanitation, and even in places under British rule only the most prominent causes of disease are removed.
?45 CHAPTER IV. STATIONS. I will now, as briefly as possible, notice those sanitary defects in each station of the Bombay Presidency which appear to me to be the most prominent.

In other words, disease must be localized before its causes can be satisfactorily accounted for. For example, at Nasirabad it appears that 30 deaths have taken place from enteric fever during the 10 years, the death-rate from this disease being the highest but one in the Presidency for these 10 years. When you come to analyse these figures as in Table VII. showing the admissions and deaths from enteric fever in each arm in each of the 10 years in each station it will be seen that 28 of these deaths and 40 admissions took place among the Infantry, whereas during the same period there were only 3 admissions and 2 deaths among the men of the Royal Artillery. The disease, therefore, is localized to the Infantry Lines. B 357-12

?47 Unfortunately I have been unable to obtain trustworthy statistics from the office of the Surgeon-General, Her Majesty's Forces, for a longer period than 1877, but with those available much useful information may be obtained. There will be noticed some discrepancy between the figures given in them and those obtained from the Sanitary Commissioner with the Government of India. This results from the fact that the Statistical Officer enters in his tables all deaths which at the post-mortem examination revealed the presence of enteric lesions as deaths from that disease notwithstanding that the Medical Officer who treated the case had entered it under the heading "Simple Continued" "or Remit- tent Fever." KARA'CHI. The site of the camp was originally selected without due appreciation of its sanitary defects, as I suppose no one would now say that it is desirable to have a mangrove swamp, 4 square miles in area, to windward at a distance of about a mile and three-quarters from the barracks. The difficulty regarding drinking water, I imagine, prevented it being located in the first instance on the high land at Ghizree, which is not only removed from the noxious exha- lations of the swamp, but is fully exposed to the breeze blowing, fresh and pure, from the Arabian Sea. In my opinion the proximity of the salt swamp is one of the principal causes of the sickness that has of late years affected the regiment occupying the Napier Barracks; and though Surgeon-General Gilborne in his report for 1881 considers that it is not the cause of fever, his prede- cessor, Surgeon-General Fogo, and the Army Sanitary Commission agree with the view that it is. The reason why it exerts a more noxious influence now than formerly may be accounted for by the fact that up to late years clean sea water flowed into it at every tide through the Chimna Creek. This inlet has, however, been closed by the railway embankment and water from the harbour now alone finds entrance into it. It is thus robbed of a great part of the scour which formerly obtained, and the result is that the depth and superficies of stinking mud, containing the debris of animal and vegetable matters which is exposed at every low tide, is increasing and must increase. It is only necessary to stand during certain seasons of the year in the early morning on the high land at Ghizree and to notice how the Napier Barracks are enveloped in mist driving up from the swamp to be convinced that such condi- tions would have been escaped if they had been placed at Ghizree, where the at- mosphere is clear at all times and where fogs and mist do not arise. So much silt has taken place between the embankment and the sea that it would be no use now to reopen the creek, and the condition of the swamp is with- out, I fear, practical remedy, unless in course of time the development of trade necessitates the construction of wet docks; but this is for future consideration, and could not be, I fear, entertained for the present: if docks are ever made, the neces- sary reclamation of the ground in their vicinity will be attended with the happiest sanitary results. In the meantime the new water-supply renders it possible to carry out Dr. Leith's suggestion of planting a thick grove of trees between the swamp and the camp. The camp was not laid out with due regard to sanitary requirements or with any foresight that Karchi would become a large station. The Sadar Bzr is now very extensive, and, according to the Census of 1881, contains a population of 5,928 persons. It is situated in the centre of camp and is directly to windward and in close proximity of some of the Infantry barracks. There are many cess- pools in it, only surface drainage, and many livery stables, which are principally situated in the quarter nearest the barracks, in which the smell from the stables was often perceptible. The General Commanding the District has no authority in the bzr, as it was most unfortunately handed over to the Municipality, and though I am glad to learn that increased attention has lately been paid to its conservancy, which no doubt will be a great improvement, yet I can only regard its position with reference to and its proximity to these barracks, as a constant source of danger to the Infantry. Competent observers (among whom I may name Deputy Surgeon General Pinkerton and Surgeon Major MacRury, Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Sind
?48 District,) are disposed to believe that enteric fever is endemic both in the bzr and in the native city of Karchi, where there are about 1,000 privies situated on the flat roofs. These are supplied with earthenware utensils which are said to be emptied every second day. Even this is an improvement on the practice which formerly obtained of making the roof itself the place of natural resort for the household where the sun desiccated the ordure which was blown by the wind far and wide; but it is manifest that with human ordure lying for so many hours within an inhabited area the breeze must become tainted and disease is likely to arise from such an objectionable practice. I hope that the Munici- pality which has so energetically carried out its water-supply will turn its atten- tion towards the construction of a sewerage scheme which would get rid of the night-soil difficulty once and for all. If no provision is made to carry off the water after use, increased sickness will, I fear, attend its introduction. The Napier or Infantry Barracks consist of upper and lower storied build- ings; the former are imposing edifices, but sanitarily speaking they are not of good design, as they are constructed to hold as many as 66 men-the proper number in a domitory does not exceed 24-whilst the ventilation, especially in the upper storied barracks, is so excessive that they are cold and draughty. When the doors are shut-and the British soldier dearly loves to exclude fresh air-the atmosphere becomes impregnated with the emanations given off by the lungs and bodies of so many men. I admit that there is some excuse for the exclusion of the breeze, which usually blows very strongly both by day and by night. Indeed the liability to chills is so great that Medical Officers used to advise the men to fold their blankets across the middle part of the body, as ex- posure to the wind during the hours of sleep is almost certain to be followed by an attack of diarrha, fever, &c. Officers and residents in private houses are, as a rule, careful not to sleep in a draught. There is no sub-soil drainage, but in the immediate vicinity of the barracks the water level does not rise within 20 feet of the surface, although no doubt it mounts by capillary attraction much higher. The soil is sand and the stratum of air over it becomes cold during the night and heavy dews and, occa- sionally, fogs prevail. Mr. Chambers in his meteorology of the Bombay Presidency, published in 1878, says: "The geological formation is tertiary, composed of strata of com- minuted marine shells alternating with layers of arenaceous and argillaceous limestone and with beds of a conglomerate consisting of rolled nodules of foraminiferous limestone which appears in many places on the surface. The surface soil is alluvial, covered in parts with drift sand of a silicious and micace- ous character. The sub-soil is chiefly clay, highly impregnated with saline matter and with sandstone lying at a greater depth. " Except in the vicinity of the Layri River at the northern end of the camp, which is the only cultivated spot, the aspect of the surrounding country is that of a barren waste, nearly flat, relieved towards the eastern and northern limits of the town land by a range of very low rocky hills. This part of Sind is with- in volcanic range, as is shown by the hot springs issuing from the coralline rock in the crater-like hollow of Mugger Peer, eight or nine miles due north of Karchi; the mud springs on the border of the Belooch Territory to the westward; the upheaval of the Ullah bund and the submersion at Lukput on the eastern side of the delta of the Indus in the earthquake of the year 1819. " The cantonment stands about five or six miles to the eastward of the harbour at Keemaree and runs parallel to the sea for a distance of about two miles in a direction from south-east to north-west. The position in which it is situ- ated bears evidence of having at one time been submerged and was probably in the course of one of the mouths of the Indus. " The Napier Lines are at the south and south-east end of the Cantonment, and are nearly on a dead level and so little above the sea that rain lies where it falls; this, coupled with the retentive nature of the sub-soil, renders the camp very little better than a swamp after a very moderate fall. " The observatory is erected in the Napier Hospital, which is built on a low rocky ridge at an altitude of about 40 feet above sea level and half a mile from
?49 the barracks in a south-east direction whith a nearly W. S. W. aspect and exposed to the prevailing winds, which are westerly and from the sea." Efforts have been made to improve the surface drainage, but water still lies in places after heavy rain, and no doubt the retentive nature of the sub-soil is one of the causes of fever. The wastage water from the plunge-bath and from the dipping well near the filters is carried away by a drain paved with sandstone to a nla between the barracks and the railway, but the stones are porous and the water escapes and forms a line of moisture to the north-east of some of the barracks. Regarding the barracks themselves the only thing I can suggest is that the long rooms be divided into two by a partition wall so as to reduce the draught and that over the doors rectangular windows be provided which should open upwards, as suggested by the Army Sanitary Commission and Mr. Lumsdaine, so as to direct the current of air entering them upwards and not downwards on to the men's cots ; and perhaps it might be well, as an experiment, to hang chicks along the outer verandahs so as to diminish the force of the wind, and if this is found to have any effect in reducing sickness, fixed venetians might be applied. The three Artillery or Somerset Barracks are upper-storied buildings and are out of the line of wind blowing off the swamp. Another great source of safety to them is that, although they are close to the Sadar Bzr, they are to wind- ward of it, and the men are, therefore, not exposed to the danger of breathing air blowing over a foul population group ; and although the men occupying them cannot be said to have been healthy, yet that they have been healthier than the men in the Napier Barracks will be seen by the following table, showing the ratio of admissions and deaths from the principal diseases per 1,000 of average strength : - Period-Six years, 1877-82.  Cholera. Enteric Fever. All Fevers except Enteric. Dysentery. Diarrha. All Causes.  A. D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. D.

Still if these admissions are eliminated altogether, it will be seen that there has been more sickness among the Infantry than among the Artillery. It is only fair also to state that the 98th Regiment landed on the 5th September 1880 from Malta and, like all new regiments, suffered on first arrival. The higher rate of dysentery and diarrha among the Infantry is a noticeable fact. The analysis of the water in the wells which formerly supplied the Infantry and Artillery is as follows :-  GRAINS PER GALLON. PARTS PER MILLION.  Total Solids. Chlorine. Free Ammonia. Albuminoid Ammonia. Well supplying Napier Barracks     791 294 Nil 06 Do.        Somerset   do. 112 4865 026 06 B 357-13
?50 It will be seen that largely as it is impregnated with total solids and earthy chlorides, yet that the well supplying the Napier Barracks yielded a not so impure water as the Artillery well; and though at first sight one is apt to suspect the water, yet on consideration it would appear that there must have been other causes in operation to produce these diseases. At all events it will be most interesting to see what effect the pure water now introduced will have on the ratios of admissions from diarrhal diseases. In reading the statistics of Ghizree it must be remembered that the Sani- tarium is in reality only a detached ward of the Station Hospital, and that as only sick men are sent there, the admission rate is consequently high. The present buildings at Ghizree have been condemned and a new Sani- tarium has been sanctioned, which is to be built when money can be found. This will be erected on the plateau, and in my opinion its site ought to be fixed with especial reference to the probability at some future date of the plateau being utilized for the location of troops. I think it extremely desirable that such a possibility should not be forgotten, but that the new Sanitarium should be placed on such a site that it could be converted into a station hospital. If this is not done now, the greatest inconvenience will surely be hereafter felt by its having been built so as to interfere with other buildings. The Army Sanitary Commission recommend that the Napier Barracks should be given up, and such doubtless would be far the best course to pursue. Much money will have to be spent before they can be made-if ever they can be made-healthy habitations. If military necessities ever compel new barracks to be erected, they should certainly not be built at Karchi but at Ghizree, or, still better, if it were possible to recover the sites from private owners, at Old and New Clifton. Only 4 admissions from enteric fever, one of which proved fatal, are record- ed in these returns to have taken place in the Artillery at Karchi during the 6 years, 1877-82. They occurred in I/Battery 1st Brigade R. A. in 1877. I find the following note in the Sanitary Report:-" The disease was prevalent in April and was confined to one barrack, cause unknown"; but enteric fever was pre- valent at the same time in the 83rd Regiment in the Napier Barracks. " Every effort was made to discover the source of the disease, but nothing insanitary was noticed after the most careful enquiry and, consequently, is supposed to be attri- butable to climatic effects". In 1878 in the 83rd Regiment there were 3 admissions and 2 deaths, and a third death took place at Ghizree which was supposed to have been contracted in Karchi. In 1880, 4 of the 9 cases occurred in the 98th Regiment in November and December. One officer, who was suffering from enteric fever, had accompanied the Regiment from Malta. The remainder of the cases took place among men sent down from Regiments serving in Afghanistan. In 1881 no admissions or deaths were attributed by the medical officers to this disease; but in 1882 the medical officer reports thus: "A large draft of about 200 men arrived from England on the 12th January. Cases of enteric fever began to crop up in the young men of the draft towards the end of February till the end of March. There was now an interval of freedom till the 27th August, when a case of enteric fever was admitted. About the same time two or three cases of remittent fever showed a few suspicious symptoms". In all there were 7 cases, one of which proved fatal. I must also call to recollection the fact that the Troops at Karchi have suffered very greatly from scurvy; and this was not only confined to the Infantry, but the men of the Royal Artillery were likewise, though not to the same extent, affected.

?54 HYDERABAD. The sub-joined tables give the disease statistics of the troops stationed at Hyderabad between 1877 and 1881. The ratio of the admissions and deaths from the principal diseases per 1,000 of the aggregate annual strength was during the 5 years as follows :- Period-Five years, 1877-81.  Cholera. Enteric Fever. All Fevers except Enteric. Dysentery. Diarrha. All Causes.  A. D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. D. Artillery   4.9 3.3 899.8  19.7  37.8  1,811.2 11.5 Infantry     947.4 0.8 27.9  27.8  1,623.4 8.5 There was no cholera among the troops during the above years and no case of enteric fever occurred among the Infantry. This fact is very noteworthy as there was in 1880 and 1881 a detachment of the 98th Regiment recently arrived from Malta in the station. The very dry climate of Hyderabad may possibly be a factor in this exemption. In 1879, two cases of enteric fever took place in the C/2 R. A., one of which is said to have been contracted on the line of march, but no cause could be assigned for the other. The case that occurred in N/1 R. A. in 1881 was contracted in Karchi, and is, therefore, not due to disease causes in Hyderabad. The Infantry detachment was on the whole healthier than the men of the battery ; but it will be observed that the cases of remittent fever were more numerous in the Infantry than in the Artillery.

?57 From the above tables it is clear that malarial fever has been the principal disease, and in seeking for its cause it is important to remember that the barracks were, during the years under report, exposed to the emanations rising from the low lying and inundated ground between the Indus and the plateau on which they are built. The late Surgeon-General, Her Majesty's Forces, does not allow that the inundations were the cause of the fevers that have always prevailed among the troops during the autumn, and suggests that the cold winds and great daily variations of temperature at this season are the more active influences in the production of malarial fevers. Undoubtedly such conditions favour a recurrence of the phenomena which we designate fever in those who have malarial poison in their blood, but that they produce fever is, I submit, not as yet established. The range at Belgaum, for example, during these months is as high as at Hyderabad, but the admission rate for fever is lower. In Belgaum, too, the fever rate begins to rise in July, when the range is the minimum of the year. But in Hyderabad the fever rate commences to rise in May and steadily increases month by month until August, when in September it takes a sudden rise which increases until December; but in January it suddenly falls to nearly a third of what it was in the previous month. This latter increase is coincident with the gradual drying up of the inundated land to windward, and in my opinion is largly due to it, as the fall in the fever rate is also coincident with the complete dryness of the land. In 1882, however, Colonel LeMesurier, R.E., Superintending Engineer in Sind, prevented the inundation, and although, of course, it is too short a time to say positively what effect this measure will have, it is interesting to observe that at the station hospital where all the troops, Artillery as well as Infantry, were treated, the number of admissions from malarial fevers was only 206 against 332 in the previous year, and the rate was the low one of 5493 per 1,000 of annual average strength. But there are other sources of malaria besides the inundated land. An abundant supply of pure water has been introduced into the camp as well as into the city, but great as this boon is to a community, it must always be attended with danger if no adequate means are provided for carrying it off after use. This danger, both as regards the camp and city, was pointed out by me in 1880, but without practical results. The surface drains for the cook-rooms and wash-houses in camp have been constructed of bricks set in lime. They are much too wide and deep, and they end in an elongated earth trench in which the water stagnates and which have been justly condemned for years by the medical officers as a cause of sickness; but no money is available to complete the system that was begun without having sufficient funds provided to finish it. The present out-fall of the drainage from these wash-houses, cook-rooms, &c., is wrong, as it is to windward of the camp, and that it will injuriously affect the Artillery sooner or later I feel certain. It is a great pity that money cannot be raised for a comprehensive scheme by which the sewage of the city and cantonment could be carried through pipe sewers to the sandy plain below and to the eastward of the city, and between it and the Fuleli as what is now an arid waste might be turned into a productive farm to the profit of all concerned. COLA'BA. The Artillery Barracks occupy the ridge on the east side of the road leading to the light-house. They consist of a single story, and are built on the high plinths on which it was originally intended to erect upper-storied barracks. For a coast climate if only they had been built on raised basements with air perflation beneath the floors, they would have been almost perfect barracks. The Infantry Barracks are situated on the low lying ground on the west of the road and between it and Back Bay along which the lines extend. They have very low plinths and are of very inferior design. The ground on which they stand is waterlogged during the monsoon and raised foot-paths are made across it to the barracks. B 357-15
?58 I was informed, as long ago as 1854, that these barracks had even then been condemned, and it was said they were immediately to be pulled down. They, how- ever, still remain, and, doubtless, the site on which they stand has been the cause of much of the malarial fever that has always affected the Infantry at this station. Another source of malaria is in my opinion the condition of the foreshore, which is covered by a mangrove swamp on the north-west, west, and south-west of the barracks. The Lascar Lines, from their proximity to the barracks, are not only a great nuisance, but their crowded state from the number of natives living in them must always be a standing danger of no inconsiderable importance to the troops. The Dept Barracks in Middle Colba are very good buildings, but have too low plinths for safety. I am informed that when the Infantry Barracks are pulled down it is proposed to build three-storied barracks on the plinths of the Napier Barracks. There is no doubt that this will be a great improvement on the existing Infantry Barracks, but it is not altogether a desirable scheme, as the men will not like them, and there is danger in aggregating a large number of men in one barrack. Supposing, for example, an outbreak of cholera occurs, it will be very inconvenient to vacate the whole building. If it were possible for Government to acquire the whole of the land between the Military Lines and the Sassoon Dock, such an extension would afford ample room for the location of both the European and Native garrison of Bombay as well as of the followers, but the cost would be so enormous that I fear there is no possibility of it being sanctioned ; and the distance the various guards would have to travel would be another objection, although, solely from a health point of view, it would be the best. The reclamation of the foreshore on either site of Colba, especially on the Back Bay side, would be an immense sanitary improvement, and perhaps this may be carried out in future years. In the mean time the troops at Colba will in my opinion always suffer from malaria until the site now occupied by the Infantry Barracks is underdrained.  When the Queen's Road Sewer is built it will be possible to extend a branch to Colba, and if this were done, all the liquid refuse as well as the night- soil and urine would be removed much more efficiently than at present, and the foreshore would not, as now, in spite of the great care taken to prevent it, be polluted by squatters. The following tables show the disease statistics of the troops at Colba since 1877, the ratios per 1,000 of aggregate average strength of the chief diseases being as follows :- Period-Six years, 1877-82.  Cholera. Enteric Fever. All Fevers except Enteric. Dysentery. Diarrha.  All Causes.  A. D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. D.

In the Artillery two men belonging to the 5/8th R. A. were admitted into hospital suffering from enteric fever in December 1878, one of whom died in the following year. No cause could be assigned for the disease. A death is also recorded in the 7/1 R. A. in 1882. In the Infantry a man belonging to the 2/7th Foot was admitted in 1880, but there are no records about this case.
?59 At the Colba Dept I find a note in the Sanitary Report for 1879 that two cases of enteric fever were admitted from the troop-ships, but no particulars are given, and these cases are not entered in the returns obtained from the Surgeon General's office. I am indebted to Surgeon Major Codrington, A. M. D., in charge of the Station Hospital, for the cases of the nine men who were admitted into it in 1882. The first case was a Private of the 2nd Wiltshire Regiment, aged 20 years, with 2 years' service, who was transferred on the 26th January from the troopship Orontes on her arrival from the Cape. This on boardship was consi- dered a case of simple continued fever, but the disease was changed to enteric fever on admission into the Station Hospital at Colba. After a long illness the man was discharged convalescent on the 3rd May. No more cases occurred in the Dep6t until October. On the 28th of that month the troop-ship Euphrates arrived in Bombay Harbour bringing troops from Alexandria and Egypt, and eight men belonging to the 2nd Derbyshire Regiment were landed with enteric fever. Of these two died and the remainder recovered after a more or less protracted illness. Another man belonging to the same Regiment was landed and it was thought he too was suffering from enteric fever, but after death "the disease was changed to dysentery, as the port-mortem examination showed there was no affection of the glands of the small intestine". On the 20th December "a Corporal belonging to the 1st South Lancashire Regiment was admitted into hospital. The man was 37 years of age, of 12 years' service, 10 of which he had passed in India and was taking his discharge to the Colonies. He left Choubuttie in the Himalayas on 1st November, reached Moradabad after a march of 12 days; left that station the next day for Shahje hanpur, where he stayed until the 21st and reached Colba on the 25th, having halted on the way at Allahabad and Khundwa. He felt unwell at Allahabad with diarrhoea and some fever, for which he got medicine. Did not come sick at Colba as he had nothing to do and was anxious to get away as soon as he could". It will be thus seen that in none of the above cases was the disease con- tracted in Bombay. [Table.]

?63 BARODA. The Cantonment stands on a porous soil with a layer of impermeable clay below. The barracks are very old and of a radically bad construction. In many of them the plinths are almost level with the ground. They are said to be damp, and as they have been built with sundried bricks, they are infested with bugs which, SurgeonMajor Hare in his excellent report for 1881 points out, destroy the rest of the men. He says:-" The insufficiency of the Infantry Quarter guard is a standing grievance and becomes year after year the subject of com- plaint, enquiry, and correspondence." The dimensions of the guardroom are thus given: length 32' 6", breadth 15' 2", height 14 feet. This room is allotted for the guard consisting of a Sergeant and nine privates, so that allowing that one man is always on sentry, the remaining 9 men have only 55 superficial feet and 766 cubic feet. Even this is not as bad as the prisoners' room which adjoins the guardroom. It is 15' 2" long by 12' broad by 14' high; and in this small room. I was informed that as many as 12 men were on one occasion confined for a few hours, so that each man had only 15 superficial feet and 212 cubic feet. The surface drainage is reported to be insufficient to carry off the storm water which is said to lie about in pools. As Dr. Hare says:- " It is true that when rain ceases this water soon sinks into the porous soil, but this is just where the mischief begins; the water is absorbed and is forgotten, and when the dry weather returns, the same water rises again in the form of malarial exhalations which fill the hospital. The ground on which the barracks stand is very flat and therefore the water will not run off unless it is conducted by artificial drains; but these should be numerous and deep, and the ground should be made to slope towards them. As for a final outlet by which the water can be discharged, this is amply provided by the little river Vishvamuntree that runs between high banks close to Cantonment." The Sadar Bzr is also in my opinion a source of disease: the streets and lanes are not metalled. It is full of cesspools and in parts very filthy. The propinquity of the nightsoil yard to it and the city must be a source of great danger not only to residents and frequenters of the bzr, but also to those living outside Cantonment limits. Plans for new barracks have, I am informed, been prepared. In an intensely malarial station like Baroda it is, I would urge, an imperative necessity that these should be built on raised basements with an air space of at least 3 or 4 feet between the surface of the ground and the floor in the rooms. But I consider that for many reasons Baroda is one of the stations which for health considerations should be given up for European troops. I imagine that the treaty under which British troops are kept at Baroda could, by consent, be so far modified that it should not be obligatory to keep them here unless in times of emergency; for surely the conditions are materially changed since the treaty was signed, and in these days of rapid railway communication there cannot be the same necessity as formerly for having them always on the spot. If, however, the station must be maintained, I think, although no doubt the climate of Baroda does exercise a prejudicial effect on the European constitu- tion, yet that the illhealth of the troops has not been solely caused by it, but is very largely to be ascribed to the infraction of well established and well recognized sanitary laws; and that to a certainty if such works as underdrainage of site, the erection of proper barracks, the removal of the manure yard from the immediate neighbourhood of the Sadar Bzr, the abolition of cesspools, and the substitution of a proper system of disposal of wastage water, &c., were carried out, the health of the troops at Baroda would be vastly improved. The execution of such works which would benefit not only the European but the Native troops as well would, of course, entail the expenditure of a large sum of money which in my opinion would be better spent in establishing on Mount Abu a cantonment for the European garrison of Gujart; but if British troops must be kept at Baroda, as His Highness the Gekwr already pays for their maintenance, might he not also be called upon to provide the money neces- sary to carry out those works which would make the place tolerably healthy \?\

?66 The above tables show how extremely unhealthy the troops at Baroda have been, as this great amount of sickness has not been due to the prevalence of epidemic disease, but was principally caused by malarial fevers. There were during the six years only two deaths from cholera. In 1877 there were two admissions and one death from enteric fever among the Artillery and two admissions, one of which proved fatal, among the Infantry. The Medical Officer says:-"One enteric fever case was caused by the foul atmosphere in which its subject was employed in the Commissariat Bakery". This building has since been vacated. A case of enteric fever occurred in the battery in 1878, but the man recovered, and since that date there has been no fresh case. The very high ratio from dysentery and diarrha among the Infantry is very noticeable, and the enormously high admission rate from all causes tells its own tale. AHMEDABAD. This is another station in Gujart which is notoriously insalubrious. In fact after Neemuch it is the most unhealthy station in the Bombay Command. During the 10 years, 1870-79, it had the highest admission rate for apoplexy of all the stations and an abnormally high one for cholera, enteric fever, malarial fevers, and diarrhoea. It stands next to Neemuch both as regards the highest admission rate from all causes and in respect to the highest death-rate. I cannot help regretting that the money expended in building new barracks at this intensely malarious station was not reserved for the establishment of a new cantonment on the Abu range. I am informed that it has been suggested to remove the head-quarters of the Northern Division to Deesa, which is certainly a healthier station. The camp at Ahmedabad as well as the surrounding country is well wooded -a condition which indicates a large amount of moisture in the sub-soil. Trees in too close proximity to buildings obstruct the circulation of air and tend to keep the temperature at night higher than in the open. The porosity of a sandy soil, as at Ahmedabad, exposes residents on it to more than usual dangers if dependent on wells for their water-supply, as is the case at this station; and that the watersupply has been impure is seen by the admission rate from diarrha which, during the 10 years, 1870-79, attained the enormously high rate of 1075 per 1,000. This is the highest rate of all the stations in the plains in India, and is only exceeded at three hill stations in Bengal. The surface drainage of camp until 1880 was very inadequate. Measures have since been taken to improve it, but Ahmedabad will always remain an un- healthy station until a new watersupply is provided and until the site of barracks, &c., is underdrained. It is a thousand pities that the new barracks in this very malarial station were built with solid plinths. I did my utmost, whilst acting as Sanitary Com- missioner in 187677 and beginning of 1878, to get the hospital at all events built on a raised basement and according to the principles laid down in the sugges- tions for barracks and hospitals in India; but my proposals, after I had given over charge of the Sanitary Commissionership, were overruled and the standard plan was adhered to, because it was the standard plan. This rigid adherence to the standard plan has added greatly to the liability to disease. The disease statistics for Artillery and Infantry since 1877 are given in the following tables. During these six years there were no cases of enteric fever admitted among the Artillery, but there had been two cases in the head-quarters of the F/4 Royal Artillery in 1876. In the Infantry one admission, which proved fatal, occurred in 1877 in the Detachment of the 2/15th Regiment. In the following year, 1878, three admissions, two of which terminated fatally, took place in the Detachment. No cause could be assigned for the appearance of the disease. It is also interesting to note that in April of 1878 five admissions, two of which proved fatal, took place in the 1st Grenadiers Native Infantry, which will be referred to in the next chapter.

?69 DEESA. The statistics of this station must be read with the caution that the weakly men from corps stationed in it are sent up to Abu for the hot weather and rains ; but making due allowance for this element of error, there can be no doubt that Deesa is a healthier station for Europeans than Ahmedabad. The following contrasted statement for the 10 years, 1870-79, is extracted from the vital statistics of the European Army in India :- Stations. Average Strength. ADMITTED INTO THE HOSPITAL PER 1,000 OP AVERAGE STRENGTH FOR PERIOD OF 10 YEARS, 1870-79. Admission Rate from causes. Daily Suck Rate per 1,000 of Strength.  Death-rate.         Cholera.

The fevers, too, are of a much less severe type, as the admission rate in the two stations during the 10 years from intermittent and remittent fevers was as follows :- Stations. ADMISSION RATS PER 1,000 OF STRENGTH.  Intermittent Fever. Remittent Fever. Deesa 433.0 75.0 Ahmedabad 507.1 407.7 It is right, however, to state that a small detachment at Baroda from 1870 to 1875 is included in the statistics for Ahmedabad. The mean diurnal range of temperature at Deesa is high, being 22. It is as usual least during the monsoon months. The Infantry Barracks at Deesa are old and not up to the requirements of the present day. The Artillery Barracks are situated too near the confines of the cantonment, and a filthy village outside it is in much too close propinquity to them, whilst the Sadar Bzr is also to windward of these barracks, though at a considerable distance. The surface drainage in the Artillery Lines is reported to be inadequate. It has lately been improved in the Infantry Lines. At Deesa there is the great advantage of a filtering medium of sand, before the water level is reached, of about 40 or 50 feet in thickness. There have however been some bad outbreaks of enteric fever at Deesa, especially among the Artillery. In 1877 there was one admission from enteric fever in the B/2, late B/4 R. A., but the man recovered, and there are no particulars on record about this case. B 357-18
?70 In the head-quarters of the 2nd batalion 15th Regiment two cases occurred which were, it was thought, contracted either at Poona or on the line of march. In 1878 a case occurred in the month of February, the man was supposed to have contracted the disease at Ahmedabad. Three other cases took place in the Regiment, and out of the four admissions only one recovered. Enteric fever appeared in the B/2 during the rainy season, September and October. There were altogether 12 cases, viz., 8 men, 1 woman, and 3 children; of these 3 proved fatal, viz., 2 men and one child. The cause was attributed to milk adulterated with water polluted by excreta; but I have been unable to find any more facts. In 1879 in the N/Battery 1st Brigade R. A. two cases of enteric fever were admitted into hospital from the same barrack-room, but the exact cause of the disease was not ascertained. And one case, which was probably contracted at Ahmedabad, occurred in the 2/15th Regiment. There are no remarks about the two cases which took place in the battery in 1881. The ratio per 1,000 of strength has been far higher among the Artillery in this station than among the Infantry, or, indeed, in any other station. I cannot but think a mistake of the gravest kind has been committed in placing the battery horse lines directly to windward of and in such close proximity to the barracks. The well from which the drinking water is obtained is, it will be remembered, close to the horse lines. As usual all the stale of the horses sinks into the ground, and although there is a great thickness of sand, yet it is a most suspicious fact that the enteric fever always occurs in the battery during or after the rainy season.

?73 MOUNT ABU. This Sanitarium is established on Mount Abu at an elevation of about 3,945 feet above the level of the sea. The geological formation consists of crystalline and transition rock. The barracks for the convalescents are somewhat crowded together, but from the nature of the ground this is unavoidable.   The water-supply, as shown by the analysis, is good, and the climate, except during the monsoon when mists prevail, is extremly pleasant and salubrious.   Europeans live on the hill all the year round, and the ruddy appearance of the boys and girls at the Lawrence School testify to the healthiness of the climate and its suitability for Europeans in India ; but, as I shall presently have occasion to note, even with all these advantages enteric fever has prevailed. This range of hills might most advantageously be made more use of for the location of the European Troops in Gujart and Rjputna. Mr. Lumsdaine submitted a most interesting report on this subject as far back as  1871, and a suitable site for a cantonment could be found at Uria where there would be plenty of room.    Before occupation it would require drainage, as it is enclosed by hills ; but this could easily be provided by cutting drains so as to   provide a ready exit for the sub-soil water through the face of the hill, and it is thought that this could be done without any great expense.    The benefit of living in such a climate to the young European soldier would be simply incalculable as he would escape much of the disease he is subject to in the plains, and now that the Railway passes the foot of the hill, he could, at a moment's notice, be sent  down to the plains if his services were required there. In considering the health statistics of the European Troops at Mount Abu it is necessary to remember that they consist of invalids sent up from Deesa, so that the admission and death rates are high ; but there can be no question that troops, if stationed on this range, would be infinitely healthier than in the plains. I find the following note regarding the two cases of enteric fever that occurred in 1878 :-" These cases were attributed to the use of water from the barrack well. This well had been dug during the hot season, but having filled during the rains, water from it was as usual taken into use. A short time afterwards these cases of enteric fever occurred, and analysis showing the water to be contaminated with sewage, it was considered the source of the disease." This well has since been given up and a fresh one in a better site used. The case in 1879 developed itself four days after arrival in the station, the man having come up from Deesa. It was therefore contracted in that station and not at Abu. [ Table.] B 357-19

?75 The following careful and able account of an outbreak in June 1882 of enteric fever among the civil population at Abu by Surgeon Major Spencer, the Superintendent General of Dispensaries and Vaccination in  Rjputna, is a real addition to our knowledge on the subject, and shows in the most forcible language that even under the most favourable conditions of climate, mode of life, &c., the neglect of sanitation is surely the cause of disease and death. I trust that the sad gloom thrown over this station by this preventible death will not be allowed to be forgotten and that the suggestions made by the committee which was convened to devise measures for the sanitary improvement of the hill will be carried out. Especial care should be taken not to allow latrines for Natives to be placed in such deadly situations as ravines, but they should be built on heights as recommended by the committee; and much greater attention should be paid to the sanitary condition of houses and their surroundings, especially regard- ing the servants' houses and privies, &c., as well as with reference to the disposal of wastage water, &c. This course is imperatively demanded, or else it is easy to foresee that some day an epidemic of enteric fever will occur which will sweep off those predisposed to it by youth and recent arrival. But the sanitation of Mount Abu must always be attended with difficulty, as in the first place the hill belongs to a Native State, and, secondly, the broken condition of the ground renders supervision a difficult matter, whilst at certain seasons of the year there is a large influx of visitors and at others of pilgrims, the latter of whom ought, at all hazards, to be compelled to pay more attention to cleanliness:- "Enteric Fever on Mount Abu from 1st January to 1st September 1882. Case No. 1. The first person attacked was a Prsi boy aged 12 years, of delicate appearance, though he has never suffered from any ailment but slight attacks of malarious fever.    He took to his bed on the 9th of June.    This boy who formerly lived at Abu with his  father has  been at a school in Bombay during the past year and returned here for his holidays on the 1st of May.    Enquiries are now being made as to whether any of his school-fellows  suffered from prolonged fever  after arriving at their homes.    This boy's home  (marked  1 in the map attached)  adjoins the bzr, but I have not been able to discover, that either previous or subsequent to his attack any resident in  the bzr suffered from the disease.    The house in which he lives is a good one with a well kept garden in front of it, and though the sanitary conditions connected with it are not of a high order, still they are relatively high, and vastly superior to those under which most of the community to which he belongs live and flourish. The chappatis which the boy ate were  made of flour of wheat ground in the house.     Their own cows supplied the household with milk both for drinking and for butter.    The chickens were home-fed.    Mutton  was procured from a butcher who supplies with meat at least six other families.    Up to the end of May water  was drawn from the 'Telegraph well,' which is one of the best in the station and consequently largely used.    Early in June, I cannot unfortunately fix the exact date, but it was probably about 1st or 2nd June, this well became dry and water was drawn from a well in the compound  which was recently  deepened.    The water is clear and bright and pleasant to drink, but the well is now 70 feet deep and may be affected by percolation and drainage from the bzr.    This water has however been used by many families for drinking purposes without, so far as can be seen,  any bad result, and notably by a European family which arrived in India in November 1879, and includes among its members 4 children,  whose ages vary from 20 to 6 years.    The mother of this family however tells me that no water is drunk by her children which has not previously been boil- ed and filtered.    The Prsi family contains 8 members aged respectively 47, 39, 21, 19, 12, 10 and 21/2 years, and a baby of five months old.    The boy of 12 alone  was attacked.    The other members, so far as can be ascertained, lived under precisely the same conditions as re- gards air, water, food, clothing, and surroundings generally, as this boy. Case No. 2. The second person attacked was a young lady 191/2 years of age, who had been 11/2 years in the country, and 7 weeks at Abu. She comes of a strong healthy family and up to within a few days of taking to her bed on the 10th of June, had been in excellent health. When a child she had measles, and of late years has been habitually constipated. The family oc- cupied the house marked No. 2 on the map, and consists of a father and mother, of middle age, and an infant in addition to the patient. This household ate club mutton, home-fed fowls, and bread from the baker, whom nearly every one employs. They kept their own cows. Water was obtained from what is known as the club well, the drinking water being carefully filtered, but while playing tennis, water from the same well was frequently drunk unfiltered. The patient was ailing for some 5 days before taking to her bed, her mother at- tributing the indisposition to the girl having eaten a toast made of doubtful anchovy sauce.
?76 On the 8th she was at a ball, and after being heated by dancing rode home (about 3/4ths of a mile) in her ball dress without any additional covering. The attack was a very severe one, the girl narrowly escaping with her life. The bowels were constipated throughout her illness, even when their contents were passed involuntarily. The house is built on the top of a hill with excellent natural drainage, but the ground immediately surrounding it was in an in- sanitary condition. There was no latrine in the compound for the servants, who resorted to a nla and to rocks in immediate proximity to the house, the inmates however declare that no smell was ever detected. House No. 1 is separated from No. 2 by two steep hills and a ravine, and they are about a mile apart. The habits and mode of life of the two families living in these houses differ greatly. Besides the difference of race, one family is high in the social scale and the other is not. Careful and minute enquiry has failed to discover that any article of food or drink was consumed alike by both patients. The Prsi did not drink either sodawater or lemonade. Case No. 3. The next person attacked was a girl aged 9 years and 5 months, the eldest of a family of 6, aged respectively 9, 8, 6, 5 and 3 years, with a baby of 3 months. The father is a European Commissioned Officer. The family lived in the house marked No. 3 on the map The patient took to her bed on the 22nd June, on which date she had been 8 months in India and 5 months on Abu. She is a delicate fragile looking child. She had chicken-pox some years ago, of late years her bowels have been relaxed. I may mention that the children of this family have 'pegged teeth.' All of them were born in India, and except the eldest, who was attacked with enteric fever, they have remained in this country since their birth. Mutton and milk were obtained from the bzr; bread from the baker usually employed here; the club well supplied the household with water which was filtered before being drunk. The house, which was built this year, is situated on an eminence which insures good natural drain- age, but the compound was in an insanitary condition. For some time there was no latrine for servants. Then a temporary one was erected which was found to be in a very foul con- dition. This house is about 100 yards to the west of No. 2. It is built on a lower knoll and is separated from No. 2 by a slight dip. The latrine was erected in this dip and im- mediately to windward of house No. 2. Case No. 4. The fourth person attacked was a married lady aged 24 years. She arrived in India for the first time in December 1876 with her husband. She returned to England in De- cember 1878 and landed in Bombay on 30th October 1881. On the 24th of June, the date of taking to bed, she had been 3 months at Abu. She has had one child which was born in September 1878, now a robust boy. She has been remarkably healthy, and as far as she knows, has never suffered from the ordinary complaints of infancy and childhood. During the early part of 1880 while in England she began to feel languid and out of sorts, but can assign no reason for this. She has been habitually constipated from childhood. Before coming to Abu this year part of a tapeworm was expelled after taking a vermifuge and a fortnight after her arrival here, on repeating the dose, the remainder was got rid of. This household consisted of husband, wife and sister and the child mentioned above. They got their supplies from the bzr, meat from Chotoo who was also emloyed by the family living in house No. 2, bread from the same baker (Pir Bux) who supplied the other two house- holds, and milk and butter from a man (Din Mahomed) who did not receive the custom of the other families. The water-supply was obtained from the club well. The house No. 4 on the map, is beautifully situated as regards ventilation and drainage, but a rather dense jungle occupies most of the compound. This vegetation concealed a considerable amount of dirt, and the attention of the master of the house had been drawn to the condition of his surroundings. The house stands on a hill. Immediately to the west of it there is a deep gorge, and in this gorge is a public latrine which is in a direct line with the house. This latrine was frequently very offensive. Case No. 5. The fifth person attacked was the sister-in-law of the above lady and lived in house No. 4. She was 20 years of age and arrived in India for the first time on the 30th October 1881. On the 30th of July, the date of taking to bed, she had been 4 months and 4 days on Abu. She was a remarkably strong looking girl and habitually took very violent exercise. She had always been particularly healthy and strong in England, and in India she thought she was proof against illness. Before her present attack she had suffered off and on for some weeks from diarrha, but not to any great extent. She also occasionally had a nasty resounding brassy cough. She nursed her sister most devotedly, performing many disagreeable offices for her, remaining at her post in the sick room till the morning of the 30th July when she was obliged to take to her bed. The attack from the outset was of a very severe character. The patient died on the 18th of August. The child was sent to the house of a friend after his mother's illness declared itself. The father had suffered from a severe attack of enteric fever in 1878. Previous Epidemics. Since and including 1876 only two cases of enteric fever are recorded as having occur- red at Abu.

?77 Sanitarium shows that two men of the 2/15th Regiment were in hospital in August 1878 with the disease. In the Abu Lawrence School which contains about 75 children of ages vary- ing from 16 to 4 years, no case has occurred since 1873. In that year two children were attacked by a prolonged fever with diarrha which was probably enteric though not recog- nized as such. In that year also a lady suffered from the disease. The house in which she lived lies quite in a different direction to the houses in which the persons lived who were attacked this year. I can learn no further particulars than that she was a young married lady who recovered after being ill for some weeks. But though no cases are re- corded as having occurred during the last 2 or 3 years, it does not follow that the disease was entirely absent, as it is possible that natives may have been affected without this coming to the notice of the medical officers. Certainly I saw a case in October last year which occurred in a flesh-eating Khallasee. Every care was taken to render the evacua- tions innocuous. Enquiries made in the bzr have however failed to establish that any other natives during last year or this year have suffered from the disease. The bzr is so small that enquiries of this nature are more easily made than might at first sight appear possible. I do not, of course, mean to assert that no case, in addition to those mentioned, did occur, but I feel confident that if the disease had prevailed during the last 2 or 3 years in anything like an epidemic form I should have heard of it. Water-supply. It will be noticed that four out of the five patients drank water from the same well, the catehment area of this well is cleaner than that of most of the other wells. At least 5 or 6 other families also used this water without any bad effect. Many of the members were young, but in one member only were the conditions of youth and recent arrival from Eng- land combined. The water was filtered fairly well in all the households, but the family living in house No. 4 had the water boiled and twice filtered before using it; in houses Nos. 2 and 3 it was twice filtered. The Prsi family used an ordinary earthenware English filter. Filtration, however, unless closely supervised as to details, instead of preventing disease may become a source of danger. It is to be noted that the two wells which supplied the four households with drinking water were very low when the disease appeared, so low that water was only obtained from them once a day with difficulty. The buckets of the bhistees when lowered into this shallow water must have disturbed the sediment, which no doubt was drawn up with the water. The club well up to the last is said to have afforded about 2 feet of water in the early morning, when a rush was made at it by the bhistees to save themselves the trouble of going to another well, a little further off. As already stated the 'Telegraph' well became dry about the 1st or 2nd of June. Food. It will be observed that 4 out of 5 patients ate bread supplied by one baker from one shop. Careful enquiries have been made not only regarding the health and general sanita- tion of the baker's household, but also the investigation has been further carried into the houses of the coolies employed in preparing the flour from which the bread is made. No- thing bearing on the subject has, I regret to say, come to light. It must be remembered thae this baker supplies nearly all the families on Abu. The circumstances connected with tht supply of other articles of food and drink have also been closely enquired into but no informa- tion of value has been elicited. If milk were in fault, it is reasonable to suppose that children as the largest consumers would have been most affected. This has not been the case. The one sodawater maker supplied all the families on the hill, but only three habitual drinkers of it were attacked, although amongst the drinkers were four persons who by reason of their age and recent arrival from Europe were in a position as regards proneness to the disease similar to those who suffered from it. Again every household but one obtains vegetables from the public garden. No connection with the disease is to be traced to the meat-supply. Heat. Two out of the four Europeans attacked passed their first hot season in India at Abu, having arrived in the country at the end of 1881. One patient spent her first hot season at Simla in 1881 and  the second at Abu in 1882.    Mrs.-passed  her first hot  season at Morar in 1877 and remained there till the middle of May 1878, when she went to Mus- sooree. She proceeded to England in December 1878 and returned to India in October 1881. The summer of 1882 spent at Abu was therefore the first that had been passed in India since 1878. The returns* annexed show the readings of the thermometer. The cool breeze which blew both day and night made the season a particularly and exceptionally pleasant one. The facts given above bearing on the heat theory will be more usefully commented on when joined with those gleaned from a larger field of experience. Insanitary Conditions. There is no doubt the conservancy arrangements as to latrines, &c., were inadequate to the number of visitors, which this year was largely increased owing to railway  communica- tion being completed.   The question has been taken up and before next season a more exten- sive and effective sanitary system will be in force.    How much or to what extent the incidence *Not forwarded.-T. G. H. B 357-20
?78 of the disease was influenced by insanitary conditions, I cannot say. As regards Abu, how- ever, it seems to me that dirt is more likely to have been a cause of sickness than heat. Personal Contact. The idea is widely prevalent in the station, among sensible people that persons 'caught' the disease from others previously affected. There is, however, no proof of this though it seems not unlikely that in house No. 4, the girl who died may have contracted the disease from her sister. There was no communication between houses Nos. 1 and 2, but there was frequent communication between those living in Nos. 2, 3 and 4. Excepting in house No. 4, I have never met with a case in India where the disease might be traced to personal con- tact with the sick, nor do I know an instance, with the above exception, of a nurse or at- tendant being attacked by it. My experience however is small, being limited to ten cases. (Signed) L. D. SPENCER, M.D., Surgeon Major, Officiating Superintendent General of Dispensaries and Vaccinations in Rjputna.

?80 TRGARH. The most urgent sanitary want at this Sanitarium is a supply of pure drink- ing water, for that obtained from the Doodea well in Ajmere is most impure, as it contains not less than 72.1 grains of total solids and the very high amount of 17.15 grains of chlorine per gallon, whilst the ammonia determi- nations are also very high, the free ammonia being .08 and the albuminoid .15 parts per million. If a pure water-supply could be obtained, it would be possible to take greater advantage of the Trgarh and neighbouring ranges. Possibly engineer- ing skill may be able to construct a reservoir among the spurs of the hills which would be commanded by the fort and entirely independent of the city of Ajmere, where the water-supply from wells and the Anasagar Lake is impure. The troops at Trgarh consist of convalescents sent up from Nasirabad, and no doubt this fact accounts for the high admission rate. The case of enteric fever in 1881 was a case which developed enteric symptoms after arrival from Nasirabad.

?82 NASIRABAD. The sanitary defects and disease causes have been fully discussed in the report on this Cantonment which I have lately submitted to Government. From a sanitary point of view they are extremely interesting, as it is evident that whilst cholera and enteric fever have, during a long term of years, almost exclusively clung to the Infantry, the Artillery, living alongside under precisely similar conditions except those of previous history of site, have nearly escaped. The cause of this localization of these two diseases being in my opinion principally due to the fact that the Infantry Barracks have been built over a site polluted during a long series of years by the huts of a Native Infantry and a Native Cavalry Regiment, whilst the Artillery Barracks stand on a site that has always been occupied by Europeans. Enteric fever is also believed to be endemic in the Sadar Bzr ; but if that were the sole source, the young men who annually come out from Home to join the Artillery would have suffered pro rata as much as the Infantry. During the ten years, 1870-79, enteric fever caused more admissions per 1,000 of strength at Nasirabad than at any other station of the Bombay Command. During the same period Nasirabad also had the highest admission rate for not only enteric fever but also for diseases of the spleen and respiratory system, whilst there was a very high rate for dysentery and a high rate for diarrha and hepatitis, and although far less than at Neemuch, still there was a high rate for malarial fever. It is not a station in which any young soldiers, especially Infantry soldiers, should be quartered during the enteric fever months, i.e., during the rains and autumn. The disease statistics since 1877 are given below. The rates of admission and deaths per 1,000 of aggregate average strength was for each arm as follows :- Period-Six years, 1877-82.  Cholera. Enteric Fever. Other Fevers. Dysentery. Diarrha. All Causes.  A. D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. D.

During the same outbreak the Infantry lost nine men from this disease, and in 1882 five deaths took place out of six admissions in the Infantry; but, as shown in the report, the statistics of a longer period demonstrate more markedly that the incidence of this disease has principally fallen upon the Infantry. The much greater prevalence of enteric fever among the Infantry is clearly shown by the above figures. The extreme prevalence of diarrha among the Artillery is however very noticeable. I had not the advantage of these tables when I wrote the report, but they bear out my opinion that Nasirabad is a most unhealthy station, and show the necessity for some decided action being taken regarding it. The death-rate during the six years under report was the highest in the Presidency. That it can be made healthier I have no doubt, but money is required to be spent before we can hope to reduce the prevalence of sickness in it.

?85 NEEMUCH. This Cantonment has been the subject of an especial report in which the causes of the disease which has rendered Neemuch by far the most unhealthy station in the Bombay Command are discussed. The Vital Statistics of the European army in India had not reached me when this report was written, but I learn from the tables in them that during the 10 years, 1870-79, Neemuch had the highest death-rate from cholera (12-91 per 1,000 of strength) among all the stations in India, although some stations in Bengal come very close to it. The admission rate for the same disease though not the highest in India, yet attained the enormously high figure of 16.9 per 1,000 of strength, whilst the rate for enteric fever, 5.4, is the 3rd highest in the Presidency; the admission rate for malarial fevers, 1,305.7 per 1,000, though not as high as at Baroda during the 6 years ending 1881, where it attained the enormously high rate of 1,576.4 per 1,000, was yet far higher than any other station named in the vital statistics; and the rates for diarrha, 100.0, hepatitis 55.4, spleen diseases 5.6, respiratory diseases 67.8, were also very high. The admission rate for all causes attained the extremely high rate of 2,242.5 per 1,000 of strength, whilst the daily sick rate was 74.2 per 1,000, and the death-rate, the very serious one, of 29.11 per 1,000. These rates are re- spectively the highest among all the stations of the Bombay Presidency, and are the strongest argument I can use as to the necessity of abandoning the station for European troops, for the sanitary defects in and outside the station are too great to admit of any effectual remedies being applied. Nor had I received the following interesting account of an outbreak of enteric fever which took place in the autumn of 1876 in E/2 R. A. at Neemuch and which is referred to by Dr. Bryden.-See page 6 of this report. This out- break appears to have been clearly due to defective iron pans in a latrine, and forcibly illustrates the necessity for substituting some other kind of receptacle for night-soil:- "The following are some of the principal facts with regard to the outbreak of enteric fever which took place in the autumn of 1876 in E/2 Royal Artillery while stationed at Neemuch:- The battery arrived in Neemuch early in the year from Kirkee. No case of the disease occurred while the battery was at Kirkee: and there is no mention in any of the records of the battery that any case of enteric fever occurred at Neemuch during the period immediately preceding the outbreak in the battery. The first case occurred about August 10th and the last of the 13 cases in the February following. Of the first five cases, all came from the same barrack (No. 1), and all used the same latrine (of which mention will be made presently). The 6th and 7th cases came from No. 3 barrack, and did not use the latrine of No. 1 barrack; but both of these men had been in attendance on the cases of enteric fever in hospital, and most probably contracted the disease by direct contagion. Cases 8, 9, 10 were all men who used the unhealthy latrine at- tached to No. 1 barrack. The case No. 11 was admitted into hospital two days after the battery had changed into new barracks, more than 1\1/2\ miles from the old ones. The case was clearly contracted in the old barracks. No other case occurred until November 5th (i.e. six weeks after the battery had moved into the new barracks). In this case no cause could be given for the attack. He had never been near any of the previous cases and had not been in hospital for six months previously, nor had he used the unhealthy latrine. No. 12 case was admitted on November 22nd and resembles the last case. No cause can be assigned for the attack. He had never been near any of the former cases. He had however been a good deal about in the neighbouring villages shooting. The 13th and last case occurred while the battery was in practice camp in the follow- ing February. It occurred in a man who had been in India a very short time (about six weeks) and no explanation of the origin of the disease can be given. The following is the description given by the Medical Officer there in charge, of the defective latrine already referred to:- 'The latrines are two in number. The latrine behind No.1 block has about eight seats. B 357-22
?86 'Four of the utensils were found to be leaky and the urine and fcal matter were saturating the soil behind the latrine and giving out a strong offensive smell. The other latrine, as well as those belonging to the patcherries, were in a fair condition.' Of the 13 cases reported nine used the defective latrine and two cases occurred in men who had been in attendance on enteric cases in hospital. Ten of the cases occurred in men under 25 years and only three in men above that age, and all were men who had recently arrived from England (the previous March). The Medical Officer in charge of the Native Troops stated that he had had several cases which he considered enteric fever although not verified by post-mortem examination. In all fatal cases the post-mortem examination invariably disclosed lesions of the same character (i.e. those typical of enteric fever). The characteristic eruption was present in about half the cases only. The drinking water all came from one well which was well protected from surface drainage and the water of which had been pronounced good after analysis. (Signed) GEO. HICKSON, Surgeon, Army Medical Department. Karchi, 3rd November 1882."

Enteric fever caused five admissions in 1882 in the Infantry and one death. The principal cause of admissions is malarial fever. The causes of its prevalence are fully discussed in the report already submitted.

?89 INDORE. The barrack is situated on black cotton soil, the absorbent condition of which during the rains must be the source of disease, as the impermeable stratum of trap rock below being in undulations forms pockets and prevents any natural underdraiuage. In the report for 1878 the Medical Officer says:- "The bad state of the health of the men in August was doubtless caused by the nature of the soil around the barrack hospital and patcherries. This year many defects have been apparent which in dryer years were not noticeable-want of deep drainage, stinking condition of parts of the soil in barrack floor." The condition of the well from which the drinking water is obtained has already been noticed. The large native city of Indore and the Sadar Bzr being although at some distance to windward of the Cantonment must also be admitted as possible causes of disease. The room for the guard over the treasury is much too small for health. From the vital statistics for the 10 years, 1870-79, it is seen that the admis- sion rate per 1,000 of aggregate average annual strength was abnormally high : cholera 9.6, enteric fever 3.2, diarrha 76.8, venereal disease 2nd on the list 274.2, respiratory disease 76.8, phthisis, the highest in the Presidency, 20.3. The rate however for malarial fever, 623.3, is not very high, and Indore stands lowest as regards dysentery and spleen diseases; but the admission rate for all causes, 1,613.7, is high and the death-rate, 20.28, very high. The statistics since 1877 are given below. Regarding the case of enteric fever admitted in 1878 the Medical Officer says:- "A case of enteric fever was admitted into hospital in April. This man recovered. I believe it originated from drinking dirty water in the jungle when out shooting." [Table.] B 357-23

?91 MHOW. A full report on this station has been submitted. The principal causes of disease are traceable to a water-supply derived from wells which are liable to contamination, the impossibility under existing circumstances of effective sanita- tion in the bzr, dampness in the sub-soil under and near barracks, damp barracks, the malarial condition of the surrounding country, and the proximity of filthy villages outside but in the immediate neighbourhood of the cantonment. The disease statistics of the various corps stationed at Mhow are given in the report and need not be repeated here. ASIRGARH. The hill on which the fortress is built rises to an elevation of about 2,300 feet above mean sea level. It is surrounded by a plain covered with dense jungle which at certain seasons becomes intensely malarious. A detachment of the European Infantry Regiment at Mhow is stationed here and it has been tolerably healthy. The admission rate, as given in the vital statistics for 10 years, 1870-79, from dysentery, hepatitis, spleen and respiratory diseases and phthisis is high. As regards the admission rate from all causes (1,580 per 1,000) Asirgarh occupies the central place in the list of stations. The daily sick-rate, 493 per 1,000, is comparatively low, and the death-rate, 1109 per 1,000, is the 3rd from the bottom of list of the stations in the plains. Cholera did not appear in the fortress during the 10 years, 1870-79, and only one case, which proved fatal, of enteric fever is reported to have occurred in 1876. Whether this was a case of true enteric fever is extremely doubtful, and it will be referred to in the next chapter. The water-supply has already been described. The disposal of the night-soil of the fortress is unique. The Medical Officer thus describes the method employed:- "The soil after mixture with dry earth is collected in iron receptacles which are carried by the sweepers to the extreme east corner of the fort and is then let down by means of a windlass for some 80 feet, whence it is carried for a distance of several hundred yards from the walls of the fort and is then thrown over a precipice. No injury to health or nuisance has been traced to this system." The bakery is situated in a Government building which is in my opinion too close to the Sukkur Tank. The making of bread is given out to a contractor who, in the report for 1880, is said to use Steven's dough-making machine, but it was not used at the time of my visit. The slaughter-house is at the foot of the hill, a short distance in rear of the Pettah. The disease statistics since 1877 are shown in the next table. [Table.]

?93 AHMEDNAGAR. Judging from the admission rate from all causes, 1,154.6 per 1,000, and the Death-rate, 8.62 per 1,000, during the 10 years, 1870-79, Ahmednagar is the second healthiest station in the Bombay Presidency. The daily sick rate, 48.9, is also low. The Artillery Barracks are very fine buildings, and the men quartered in them have been very healthy. The sanitary arrangements, generally speaking, in these barracks are excellent. The principal defects in the barracks now occupied by the Rifle Battalion, and formerly by the Cavalry, are owing to faulty construction. There are twelve barracks, and each one has under the same roof a wash- house which is only separated by a narrow passage from the barrack-room. The floor of this is paved, but of the twelve barracks, five show signs of damp in the external wall of the plinth. There must be soakage under the floors of the barracks. There are only two latrines, each containing twenty-four seats. One is 42 yards behind and to the south-east of the rear barracks on the right flank; the other is 80 yards behind and south by east of the left rear barrack, and it is only about 20 yards north-east of the hospital. It is badly ventilated, and the smell in it, at the time of my visit, was very bad. The patcherries are on the north by east of the barracks. They con- tain about 80 rooms, 40 of which are now occupied by men of the Rifle Brigade. The floors of most of these patcherries are paved, but some of them were cow- dunged until Surgeon-Major Murtagh in charge of the Station Hospital wrote to the Officer Commanding on the subject, since which time they have been clay- washed ; but as the plinths are very low, the earthen floors should be dug out for a certain depth and covered with concrete. The following remarks by Dr. Murtagh regarding enteric fever are very valuable :- "I believe that the fouling of the water through the breach in the Shhpur aqueduct was the cause of the enteric fever in the commencement of 1883. The breach was about 50 yards from the public road, and was of such extent and kind that it made a capital place for washing clothes and bathing in, and from my knowledge and experience of the native character I have no doubt but that it was used for these purposes by travellers. I could not find that any enteric fever had occurred in the houses near, but the corpse of a man was found a little way off about the time of the first occurrence of typhoid in camp. I could not get the exact date. The Rifle Brigade only used the water from this aqueduct and they only got enteric fever. The Royal Artillery used other water (Bhingar aqueduct) and no case of enteric fever nor any fever like it occurred amongst them. The admissions for enteric fever ceased soon after the breach was closed. It is possible that the clothes of typhoid patients were washed in the Shhpur aqueduct." The disease statistics since 1877 are given below :- Period-Six years, 1877-82.  Cholera. Enteric Fever. Other Fevers. Dysentery. Diarrha. All Causes.  A. D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. D.

This is much to be regretted. The present wash-houses should in my opinion be at once removed and detached lavatories be built for the men, and the damp floors should be dug up and the damp earth removed and a layer of Portland cement concrete substituted. I have stated under water-supply the action I think necessary regarding the aqueducts, but I would also mention that at the Artillery Barracks there is a system of lower and upper cisterns and distributing pipes for each barrack. This is an excellent arrangement, but it should be carried a little further, as I learn from the Executive Engineer, Mr. Pottinger, that the Bhingar aqueduct is only 4 or 5 feet below the surface ; and he makes the very practical suggestion "that the lower cisterns should be deepened and connected direct with the aqueduct and then covered over so that the water could practically be pumped direct from the aqueduct to the upper cisterns". The same arrangements could be carried out for the Infantry, and its ad- vantages are so manifest, as it would do away with the danger of the musucks as well as save the cost of the maintenance of the Bhisties, that I hope Govern- ment may be pleased to sanction it, B 357-24

?96 PURANDHUR. To this Hill Sanitarium are sent convalescent soldiers from Mhow, Asigarh, Ahmedabad, Baroda, Bombay, Kirkee, Poona, Ahmednagar, &c. There are four barracks with accommodation for 119 men beside the hospital which holds 32 beds. The cold north and north-easterly winds which prevail from November to February are said to be injurious to men suffering from debility, the result of long standing malarial fever. The water-supply is good and abundant. The night-soil is buried in pits situated on the south-east, west and north-west sides of the hill, and about 300 yards distant from the barracks. The dry refuse is carted away to the south-east side of the hill where it is thrown over the side or burned. The refuse water from the barracks is carried away by paved drains, or is removed by hallkhor bheesties in iron receptacles. The disease statistics are given in the following table. The admission for enteric fever in 1877 is said by the Medical Officer to have been a doubtful case, and the fatal case in 1878 is said to have been contracted before arrival at the station. No details are given respecting the fatal case in 1879:-

98 POONA. In the vital statistics for the British Army in India for the 10 years, 1870-79, the disease statistics of the British Troops at Poona and Kirkee have unfortunately not been shown separately but embrace the two stations. From them, therefore, no safe conclusion can be drawn as to the sanitary condition of either cantonment. At Poona there are barracks at Wanowri and at Ghorpuri. These were fully reported on in 1876, and as they are so well known, it is unnecessary to describe them now. Suffice it to say that it has of late years been a notorious fact that the troops living in the Ghorpuri Barracks have suffered from sickness. I could not, from the records in the Surgeon-General's Office, be sure what troops had occupied each set of barracks and therefore thought it better to trust to the local authorities, and I am indebted to Deputy Surgeon-General Bradshaw, A. M. D., for the following tables which show the disease statistics of the troops occupying them between 1877 and 1881:-

?101 The ratio of admissions and deaths per 1,000 of aggregate stength during the five years was as follows :- Period-Five years 1877-81.  Cholera. Enteric Fever. Other Fevers. Dysentery. Diarrha.

In 1877 cholera caused four admissions and three deaths and in the following year five admissions and three deaths in the Wanowri Barracks, whilst among the troops at Ghorpuri in 1877 two men and in 1878 three men died from this disease. Since 1878 there has been no cholera among the European troops in Poona. In considering the admissions and deaths from enteric fever I must point out that there is a discrepancy in the figures given in the above tables and in those supplied in Table VI. by the Sanitary Commissioner with the Government of India, thus :- Years. 1880. 1881.  A. D. A. D. Above Tables  2 2 10 6 Table VI. 6 6 16 10 This arises from the fact before noticed that in all fatal cases where enteric lesions are found the deaths are ascribed by the Statistical Officer to the Sanitary Com- missioner with the Government of India to enteric fever although the Medical Officer in charge has entered them under different headings. Regarding the outbreak at the Ghorpuri Barracks in the 1st Battalion Rifle Brigade in 1880, Dr. Broke Smith, then in charge of the regiment, reports:- "The outbreak of enteric fever (so called) amongst the men of the 1st Battalion Rifle Brigade took place during the period between the middle of July and the middle of August. In my opinion the disease was merely a variety of malarial affection occurring in men living in all respects under the same circumstances as regards locality, duties, habits and exposure as their comrades, and exhibiting at the commencement of their sickness precisely similar symptoms to those observed in other men suffering the more usual form of malarial poisoning, the peculiar enteric symptoms only developing themselves after prolonged illness. Nothing specific except the general malarious influence prevalent throughout the lines could be discovered to account for this peculiar form of attack. "Each company of the Battalion, with the exception of 'I,' quartered in the centre of the lines, furnished a case; 'F' Company, quartered in the extreme blocks of the new barracks, furnished two from bungalows Nos. 4 and 5. The other cases came from Nos. 1, 3, 6, 7, 15, respectively, and the Sergeant Instructor of Musketry from one of the Staff Sergeants' bungalows." The 1st Battalion Rifle Brigade was removed from these barracks on the 22nd August 1881 on account of the great prevalence of sickness among them and was sent to Ahmednagar for a change. It was then ordered that the barracks should remain vacant for two years, but military exigencies compelled them to be partly reoccupied and the 9/1 Mountain Battery are now (July 1883) in them. The barracks were occupied from March to June 1880 by the 5/8th Royal Artillery, and the following table shows that, although acclimatized soldiers and of much more powerful physique than the men of the Rifle Brigade, they yet suffered abnormally :- B 357-26

In the first place the radical error has been committed of placing them on the very confines of the cantonment. The jurisdiction of the General Officer Commanding the Division only extends as far as Byroba's Nla which adjoins on one part the compounds of the Officers' Lines. On the far side of this nla extending between the Khadakvsla Canal and the river there is for miles an extensive area under wet (sugar-cane) cultivation. Over these fields large quantities of manure containing a large proportion of human excrement are spread. This cultivation is perennial, and vast volumes of water are constantly thrown over the land, and in the early mornings a mist will be seen to have formed over this tract. On the same side of Byrob's Nla as the lines, and in fact adjoining them but outside Cantonment limits, is the filthy village of Ghorpuri. The inhabitants resort to the fields or to the nla for natural purposes. Of course in the fields there is no sort of supervision. The owners make what mess they please, they store what manure they please, and they are practically out of the reach of any sanitary supervision. In fact it must be acknowledged that extending from south through east to north the whole of the country in the rear of the lines is in an insanitary state. The ground to the front of the barracks is also in my opinion malarious. The soil on which they actually stand is doubtless moorum, more or less hard according to site; but all round the front of the lines and to windward of the barracks is a large area of red soil merging in places into black, and it is retentive of moisture. During the monsoon, when there is but little sun to assist evaporation, the wind passing over this area from the race-course hill blows cold and chill and is driven into the barracks, especially into the new ones which are nearest to it The older barracks, although far inferior in design and construction, are more shel- tered, and the men occupying them are said not to suffer as much as those who live in the new barracks. Then, again, the ground in front slopes down to the nla running past the Native Infantry Lines. The bed of this nla has in parts silted up and is most uneven. The banks in places have fallen in and impede the ready escape of sub-soil water. The ground above the banks has been wisely planted with mango trees, but it will be many years before they attain sufficient size to form a pro- tective barrier. It is often said that on the site where the barracks stand the rock is close to the surface. In places it undoubtedly is so, but it is not hard, compact trap rock, but trap that is in process of disintegration, and that there is moisture in the sub-soil is manifested by the thick grass which in places grows in tufts. The wash-houses are attached to the verandah of the barracks and are a source of dampness, whilst the wastage from these places flows into cisterns at head of gardens. I regard this as most objectionable as the ground in the im- mediate vicinity of the barracks is kept damp.
?103 I must also state my opinion that the mules of the mountain battery are in too close proximity to the barracks. It is true they are not quite in the line of the prevailing wind, yet they are on the windward side and the soil is becoming saturated with urine. I do not believe that except by incurring a very large expenditure of money, such as we may feel certain will never be forthcoming, these barracks can ever be made as healthy as those at Wanowri which have the great advantage of not only standing on the hard and compact trap rock itself, but in having immediately in front of them an area with but little surface soil, whilst the barracks themselves are of better design. The older barracks are in my opinion as regards design much better suited to the climate of Poona than the new, though they need the alterations I pointed out in my report for 1876 to make them what they should be; but they seem to me the best adapted of any in the cantonment for the admission of a sufficient quantity of air without exciting draughts, and I think it is a pity that the new barracks at Ghorpuri were not built on their design. The Government of India has, I am informed, refused to allow the Ghorpuri Barracks to be permanently abandoned as the Government of Bombay recom- mended. If they are ever to be used again, none but acclimatized troops should be allowed to occupy them, and that they will suffer may be predicated from the experience of the 5/8th R. A. In these barracks the ventilation is excessive, and I should advise that some arrangement be made to keep out the full force of the wind during the monsoon, especially in the new barracks, which are most exposed to it. Perhaps this can best be effected by putting up permanent windows in addition to the venetians. It is especially necessary to defend the open spaces leading from the outside into the verandahs, for they are the cause of much of the draughts. I recommend that the men occupying these barracks during the monsoon be made to provide them- selves with knitted Cardigan jackets to wear after sundown, and that an extra blanket should be served out to them. I must also mention that no provision has been made regarding the wastage water spilt from the Khadakvsla stand-pipes. Moisture in the soil means fever, and it would be an immense improvement to carry out some such scheme as was originally proposed by Mr. Whiting, C.E., and to convey the night-soil as well as the refuse water from the bath and cook-rooms through glazed stone or earthenware pipes to the fields towards the river. Colonel Ducat, R.E., has prepared a scheme for the Native Infantry Lines into which 'sewers from the Ghorpuri Barracks could enter; and I am certain if it were ex- tended so as to connect with Ghorpuri, it would improve the healthiness of the site. The sub-soil drains put down by Colonel Ducat in the portion of black cotton soil, of which the officers' compounds and the ground adjacent to them consists, were simply designed for the purpose of preventing water lying on the surface near the Officers' Lines. I have attentively observed the condition of this area during the present monsoon and am of opinion that they for the present answer their purpose; but I must bring to prominent notice that at their points of discharge the pipes have become blocked by earth. The main nls require cleaning, and the mouths of the drains should always be free so as to admit a free current of air passing up the pipe. The underdrainage of the whole area of the lines is required,-and in my opinion a very much larger area in addition,-as I do not believe that anything short of the underdrainage of the large area of retentive soil to windward will affect the malaria-producing causes. The bed of the nla near the Native Infantry Lines requires thorough cleaning from its commencement and the removal of all the earth that now impedes the flow of water, and its bottom would be greatly im- proved by being covered with a layer of concrete. The condition of the Sadar Bzr has been very greatly improved since I reported on it in 1876. Colonel Ducat has commenced a system of open segmental cemented drains which are infinitely superior to the cut-stone ones formerly existing. These are flushed with Khadakvsla water twice a day; but greatly superior as they are to the old ones, they are far inferior as sewers
?104 to pipes. They are now used as sewers, for every privy in this large town with its population of 20,000 inhabitants is or will be connected with them, and although night-soil, except surreptitiously, is not admitted into them, the urine and kitchen refuse water are and must be. The out-fall at Sacha Peer into the Manik nla is especially dangerous. Colonel Ducat is fully aware of the imperfections of the present state of things which would all be altered if his sewerage scheme for the native city were carried out, when the present carriers would form excellent storm water drains. I have no doubt that enteric fever is endemic in the Sadar Bzr and adjoining native city, and it cannot be wondered at seeing the magnitude of the evils portrayed by Colonel Ducat in his sewerage report. I think also that it has been a great sanitary mistake to have allowed wet cultivation in the immediate neighourhood of the Cantonment, and the heavy manuring of vast areas with poudrette is in my opinion fraught with danger to the public health, as this is dry and not in a fit state to be immediately assimilated by plants. I also recommend that the Cantonment's limits be extended on the east so as to include the Cavalry parade ground, from which a line should be drawn on the east to opposite the village of Wanowri. If this were done, the villages of Ghorpuri and Wanowri would be included in the Cantonment. Or, if this course cannot be taken, the villages could be formed into a municipality like Bhingr at Ahmednagar has been. In conclusion I think it is only fair to invite especial attention to the fact that although the troops in the Ghorpuri Barracks have, as shown above, been much more unhealthy than those occupying the Wanowri Barracks, yet that they have not been as unhealthy as troops in other stations, and according to the statistics have suffered less, for example, than either the Artillery or Infantry at Kirkee. KIRKEE. This station is the permanent head-quarters of the Artillery in the Bombay Presidency. There is also a detachment of British Infantry supplied from one of the regiments in Poona. I am informed by the Assistant Quarter-Master General of the Poona Division that "there is no hard and fast rule for the relief of the Kirkee British Infantry detachment. The General changes the company generally whenever the Officer Commanding the Regiment furnishing it applies for its relief; practically I find that in the past five years the company has been relieved as a rule twice a year, the exception being a company of the Rifle Brigade remained there from February 1882 to January 1883". I can, for the reasons stated under Poona, only give statistics of disease among the troops at Kirkee between 1877 and 1882. The ratios of admissions and deaths per 1,000 of aggregate annual average strength during the six years, both Artillery and Infantry detachment, were as follows, and show that the Infantry are more unhealthy than the Artillery:- Period-Six years, 1877-82.

108 There is no record of the barracks from which the cases of enteric fever were admitted, but I am informed that the outbreak in the detachment of the 78th Highlanders in 1880 took place in one of the seven low-storied barracks which have since been pulled down. The barracks at present occupied are as a rule fine buildings with well raised but unfortunately solid plinths, but they are draughty and the ventilation in them is, during the monsoon, excessive. They afford another illustration of the mistake of having one standard plan of barracks applicable to all stations without reference to climate. The temperature of the air at Kirkee and Poona although hot during the month of April rapidly becomes cooler on the approach of the South-west Monsoon, and during the rains is often cold and raw as the strong south-west wind blows over large tracts of country which are very wet, taking up in its passage a great deal of moisture, and those who are subject to fever cannot, with impunity, during the monsoon, sleep in the breeze. The barracks are situated on rising ground to the right bank of the river Moola but on a lower level than the upland near Ganesh Khind, and the storm water falling on this soaks through the intervening plain down to the river. The principal cause of disease at Kirkee is malaria, and I look with extreme apprehension at the late extension of wet (sugar-cane) cultivation to the windward of the station, especially as at Poona the fields are heavily manured with poudrette. Another source of malaria is the wet condition of the ground below the left branch of the Mutha Canal. The earthen sides of the canal are not water-tight and it is carried across nls through sheets of corrugated iron which leak. Much leakage escapes from the canal and from these carriers, and wherever it does so, the ground becomes marshy and rushes are seen to grow; and if speedy measures are not taken to remedy it, the station will become intensely malarious, especially as the drainage from the canal gets into pockets of black or red soil from which the water cannot escape into the nls owing to intervening barriers of rock. The wet cultivation that has been allowed directly to windward of the bar- racks must infallibly prove a source of disease. It seems extending to in the direc- tion of Aound, and I think Government House at Ganesh Khind will feel its in- fluence if it is permitted, or if some measures of underdrainage are not undertaken. In my opinion no sugar-cane cultivation should be allowed within a certain radius of a station; but I observe that it is carried on in fields adjoining houses in the Kirkee road, and it is only a question of time before their inmates suffer. The wastage water difficulty is felt at Kirkee as at other stations, but with such a plentiful supply of water as now introduced there would be no difficulty in providing a sewerage scheme to remove this as well as the night-soil, urine, &c., if only money could be found for its execution. As at Poona, I think endeavours should be made to prevent the full force of the wind blowing into the barracks during the monsoon, and proper clothing and an extra blanket seems also to be most desirable at this station, KHANDA'LA. The barracks are built near the edge of the Western Ghts at an elevation of about 1,800 feet above mean sea level. Convalescent soldiers are sent here during the hot season, and as the climate is cool and pleasant and within the influence of the sea breeze, they derive much benefit for the change. A mountain battery has of late years also been kept here; but during the monsoon the rain-fall is so excessive and the barracks are consequently so damp and cheerless, that the battery is moved into Poona. The following table shows the disease statistics for the three years 1880-82. There was a high rate of admission for dysentery in the 66th in the month of December 1880, but the Regiment having just returned from service in Afghanistan and whilst awaiting passage to England, the men had a good deal of money and partook of more liquor than was good for them. The drinking water is brought at this station through an iron pipe from a reservoir at Lanowli on the top of the Ghts. It is said to be of good quality.

?110 SA'TA'RA. The ground on which the barracks stand being situated on the side of a hill is, during the monsoon, rendered damp by the water passing through the sub-soil from the upper levels. The barracks have well raised but unfortunately solid plinths, and are therefore liable to be made damp. During the 10 years, 1870-79, the average aggregate annual strength was 1,708, and there were only two admissions from cholera which recovered and six cases of enteric fever, three of which proved fatal. Of these admissions three took place in December and one in February, March and April respectively; whilst the most numerous admissions from remittent fever occurred during the months of May and June. The admissions from intermittent fever take a sudden rise in July and continue to be numerous up till November. After intermittent fever venereal diseases cause the most numerous admissions, there having been 546 men admitted from them during the ten years. The rate for these diseases, 3191 per 1,000 of strength, is far the highest in this Presidency, and is due to the surrounding villages being simply nests of prostitutes. The Contagious Disease Act has not been applied to Stra. The admission rate for all causes, 1,3669 per 1,000, is the 5th from the bottom of the list of stations; and the death-rate, 1171 per 1,000, occupies the same place. The daily sick rate, 603 per 1,000, is high and stands 5th from the top in the list of stations. The disease statistics since 1877 are given below. There was only one case of cholera which recovered and three mild cases of enteric fever. If it were not for the very large amount of venereal disease Stra would rank high among the stations for health:- [Table.]

?112 KOLHPUR. The European barracks at this station are very old with low plinths; the roofs, which are tiled, leak; and the damp rises from the ground. There is no sub-soil drainage. The Sadar Bzr is at a long distance from the barracks and on a different watershed. It is rather close to the hospital, but is a small place and kept as clean as circumstances admit. Kolhpur is only temporarily occupied by European Troops. A detachment consisting of two companies of the R. I. Fusiliers having been stationed here since June 1881. The principal disease is malarial fever; the ratio of admissions for this disease per 1,000 of annual strength was 7719, and that for all causes 1,5614 per 1,000. It possesses a very salubrious climate, good water, and would be an exceptionally healthy station if the barracks were improved and the site drained. If, as has been proposed, Belgaum is ever given up to the Madras Presidency, there could not be a better site for a new cantonment in the plains than Kolhpur, and it would be very suitable for young soldiers. BELGAUM. Belgaum is the most southern of the stations occupied by British Troops in the Bombay Presidency and is situated on the verge of the great Deccan trap area. It is by far the healthiest cantonment in the Command, and I hope will never be given up by Bombay Troops. The aggregate average strength of the troops stationed in it during the 10 years, 1870-79, was 9,660, during which period only one case of cholera, which proved fatal, occurred. There were 10 admissions from enteric fever, 2 of which took place in April, 4 in July, 1 in August, 1 in September, and 2 in December. One case occurred in the year 1875, re- garding which I have been unable to learn anything. In the Sanitary Report for 1877 Surgeon Major Giraud makes the following remark:- "There were five cases of enteric fever of which the diagnosis during the course of the disease was clear although the so-called characteristic symptoms were by no means complete or distinct. Of these five cases three terminated fatally. During the months of July, August, September and October there were, however, many cases of paroxysmal fevers which showed a strong tendency to assume an enteric type and, doubtless, if it had been possible to have examined the mucous membrane of the intestines of these cases, they would all have been returned as enteric fever. It is very hard indeed to draw a line between the milder cases of enteric fever and many cases of remittent and intermittent fever of apparently malarious origin, and there can be little doubt but that many cases of the former are treated as cases of the latter. This will go a long way to account for the enormous mortality from the disease in India as compared with England and other temperate countries, the fact being that only the most severe and well marked cases are returned as enteric fever. The five cases in question came from five different barrack-rooms in different parts of the lines, and the most careful investigation and enquiry failed to discover any trace of specific poisoning in any one of the cases." And in the Report for 1878:- "There were four admissions from enteric fever of which three proved fatal; one case was furnished from the battery and two from the regiment. In these cases the characteristic symptoms were not complete or distinct although the diagnosis was clear, and all three cases were, doubtless, of malarious origin. The most careful investigation failed to disclose any specific poisoning in any of the barracks from which the men came." The rate of admissions from malarial fevers, 3141 per 1,000, was the lowest in the Presidency, whilst the rates for dysentery, diarrha, hepatitis, spleen and respiratory diseases and phthisis were low; but 2,255 men, or 2334 per 1,000 of strength, were admitted during the 10 years for venereal disease; and Belgaum stands 4th in the list of stations for these diseases. The disease statistics since 1877 are given below. The ratios of admissions and deaths by corps were as follows:-
?113 Period-Six years, 1877-81.  Cholera. Enteric Fever. Other Fevers. Dysentery. Diarrha. All Causes.  A. D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. D.

The barracks in the fort are not so well situated, as the site is low and undrained ; but much improvement has taken place since my report in 1876, and I was glad to see that much undergrowth had been removed. The principal disease causes at Belgaum appear to me to be the following :- The barracks are said to be made damp by leakage from the roofs and driving rain; but this is less than in some stations. There is a tank to the north of the Artillery stables which is likely to "be a nuisance and a source of disease. Its conservancy always is a source of anxiety to the authorities. The chief danger at Belgaum is the undrained condition of the Sadar Bzr which, however, stands on the slope of the hill and is well-looked after by Colonel Trueman, the Cantonment Magistrate, but it contains numerous cesspools. The large native town also is situated between the camp and the fort, and the road to the latter skirts its lower part. I noticed a great and substantial improvement in the conservancy of the town since the date of my report in 1876, and the abolition of the pit privies and the substitution of latrines, from which the ordure is daily removed, is a great step in advance. Much good work is being done in the town, and I trust it will be continued under the new rgime. The disposal of the night-soil from the Sadar Bzr at the manure yard on the Khnpur road is open to objection, and it is much to be wished that the poudrette system which has been introduced into the town with, I am informed, great success, was carried out with regard to the night-soil of the cantonment. I must particularly notice that I found at a careful inspection of the men belonging to the Irish Fusiliers and G./Battery remarkably few cases of spongy and none of bleeding gums. This condition I attribute to the fact that green vegetables are very cheap and plentiful at Belgaum. [Table.] B 357-29

115 In concluding this review of the disease statistics of each arm in stations I have prepared the following table to show the ratio of admissions from the principal diseases, and from all causes, as well as the death-rate per 1,000 of aggregate annual strength at each station and in the Presidency among the men of the Royal Artillery as contrasted with the Infantry. There seems to be a general impression that the men of the Royal Artillery, who are as a rule older and of more powerful physique, do not suffer from disease as much as the Infantry ; but it will be seen that the ratio of admissions from all causes as well as of deaths was during the 6 years, 1877-82, actually higher in the Artillery than in the Infantry. Doubtless the more numerous admissions among the Artillery from injuries swell the number of total admissions ; but the table will show there is no marked difference as regards the incidence of disease between men of either arm. Though perhaps this may be slightly in favour of the Artillery, especially in the case of enteric fever, which is more prevalent and fatal among the Infantry :-  RATIO PER 1,000 OF ANNUAL AVERAGE STRENGTH.

?118 CHAPTER V. From an examination of the cases which have been forwarded to me by medical officers it appears that it is quite the exception for the disease, on the patient's first admission into hospital, to be diagnosed as enteric fever, as in a large majority it is ascribed to either intermittent, remittent, or continued fever, and only when enteric complications arise, is the disease changed. I also notice that the temperature charts in a large number of cases do not present the same fluctuations as are met with in England or as are depicted by Wunderlich and other authors as diagnostic of enteric fever. The absence of the characteristic eruption is also very frequently observed; and sometimes there appear to be no abdominal symptoms so marked as to attract attention until a post-mortem examination reveals the presence of ulceration in the solitary or agminated glands of the lower part of the ileum. According to Wilks and Moxon "the peculiarities of the 'typhoid ulcer' are quite sufficient to distinguish it from all other ulcers, even from tuberculous ulcerations, which also affect Peyer's patches," but in India it is not in all cases an easy matter to make a distinction between it and other ulcers. Whether infarction or ulceration of the glands in the lower part of the ileum are to be regarded ipso facto as indisputable evidence that the dis- ease from which the patient died was enteric fever whether specific or not is a question that must be left to further investigation at the bedside, in the dead-house, and with the microscope. I would however desire to lay stress on the extreme importance of making a special enquiry on the spot as to the circumstances attending the previous history of each individual patient for at least 14 days before he was first taken ill. This living over again as it were the life of each patient before his attack with differentiation of his life from that of other people is, as Dr. Buchanan says, difficult enough even under the conditions of English society; but in India with the unintelligent class of men, such as soldiers generally are, the difficulty is greatly enhanced, especially when it is remembered that the patient himself is usually so ill as to be unable to recall to recollection what he had been doing or where he had been for even a much shorter period. The information on these points obtainable by enquiries from his comrades is almost invariably very unsatisfactory. At present medical opinion in this country as to the significance of these lesions is most conflicting. Many medical officers with whom I have had the advantage of discussing this subject seem to think that the lesions which would be considered pathognomonic of specific enteric fever in Europe are by no means conclusive evidence that the disease was induced by a specific morbid contagium derived from the intestines of a previous case or even from fcal poisoning, but agree with Sir Joseph Fayrer that malaria must be admitted among the exciting causes of the disease he proposes to call endemic enteric or continued fever as contradistinguished from specific typhoid fever, which he fully acknow- ledges is met with in India. A late distinguished member of the Bombay Medical Service, Dr. Morehead, also held that "Disease of Peyer's glands either in a state of turgescence or ulceration is not a morbid state peculiar to typhoid fever. It occurs in cholera, in protracted diarrha, in acute muco-enteritis, as an occasional complication of remittent fever, and a frequent one in phthisis pulmonalis". Others, again, hold that the lesions are really as truly pathognomonic of enteric fever in India as they are in Europe, and that they are solely the result of a specific morbid contagium. It may be interesting to give some illustrative cases where doubt as to the true character of the disease has been entertained. The first case is that of Private Hands of the 17th Lancers. The two able and experienced medical officers who attended this man considered he was suffering on first admission with remittent fever, but three days before his death the disease was changed to pneumonia. I notice a discrepancy regarding the date of the commencement of the attack between the statement made by the patient and that contained in the post- script. I also think the date of arrival in India, as given in the postscript, can hardly be correct, as it appears from other documents that the Left Wing arrived in Bombay on the 11th of November but did not reach Mhow until the 14th. The symptoms detailed in the case certainly bear a very strong resemblance to, and lead me to consider it, a case of enteric fever; but in discussing the subject with Surgeon Major Robinson, who had been with the Regiment in South
?119 Africa and had accompanied it to India, his opinion that the disease was pneumonia remained unaltered. The death has been entered by the Statistical Officer with the Government of India as having been caused by enteric fever. "Regimental No. 1930. Name.-Private Ben Hands. Age last birth-day.-23 years.

District.      Mhow, 26th September 1882. N.B. - This man embarked from South Africa, 19th October 1879 ; arrived in India, 14th November 1879 ; enjoyed good health in South Africa and during the voyage ; first taken ill on day of disembarkation at Bombay. This man's disease was changed to pneumonia three days before his death."                               The next case is that of Private Stamp of the 2/17th Regiment, for which I am indebted to Surgeon Quill, A. M. D. It is of great interest as the only case of enteric fever which has been known to have occurred at the fortress of Asirgarh. The only information I can learn is that the Regiment arrived in Bombay harbour on November 7th, 1876, landed next day the 8th, and left Bombay for Devlli the same evening; left Devlli on 10th and 11th; left Khundwa for Mhow 12th and 13th . The deceased probably got out of the train at Chandni Station before reaching Khundwa. He was attacked with fever on December 16th, one month after arrival at Asirgarh. The Medical Officer says this was an obscure case, and I agree with him During life and even after the post-mortem examination the disease was considered to be simple continued fever, but was changed to enteric fever because a few small circular ulcers, which were very small and shallow and not surrounded by vascularity or congestion, were found in the ileum about a foot or 18 inches from the ccum. Peyer's patches were neither indurated or inflamed. Was this a case of specific enteric fever ? I very much doubt it. If it was, it is most satisfactory to observe that the germ, or contagium, died apparently with the patient, for during the six years that have followed not a single case has subsequently taken place, although there have always been some men in the detachment predisposed to enteric fever by young age and recent arrival; and the interesting problem arises, Why has it not appeared ? I cannot help thinking that the isolated position of the fortress, the great care taken in its sanitary arrangements, the absence of a Sadr Bzr, the exceptional method of the disposal of night-soil, have a great deal to do with the exemption.

Temperature 102; pulse 104 and soft; had no sleep the orderlies say last night, but he seems to me to be drowsy; bowels moved once between 11 and 12 last night; stool fluid, just the beef tea altered by the stomach and bowels, no blood therein. There are no spots discer- nible on his body; no tenderness of abdomen and no pains there or elsewhere. On the whole I think he is a shade better to-day. Yesterday at 9 A.M. he had a dose of 5 grs. of quinine in addition to the 11/2 gr. in his acid mixture, and at 6 P.M. 5 grs. were given him with 4 grs. of the powder ipecac., opi., and nit. potass. He takes all his food well and it seems to agree with him.  Ordered to have 6 grs. quinia at once with the acid mixture and to continue the nourish- ment all day as before. December 31st, 16tk day. L.M. Wme 12 ozs., B. T. 3 pts. Vesper 6 p.m. January 1st. Last evening at 5 P.M. his temperature 1026; pulse 104; had had no sleep all day; he was ordered chloral hydrat. grs. 15. h.s.s.

Temperature 1045; pulse 120, weak; takes all food well; tongue brown and dry; no chloral hydrat. To-night. He died last evening at 11 P.M.; his attendants noticed him breathing rather fast and in a few moments he had ceased to breathe. Post-mortem Examination held at 1130 this day. Body well nourished. Lungs much congested and the larger passages were almost filled with frothy mucus; the posterior portion of both lungs was almost solidified and was of dark purple hue, so intense was the congestion. Pericardium contained a very small quantity of fluid. Heart was pale and flabby and contained two clots of colourless fibrine, one at the aortic valves, the other in the right ventricle; the valves were healthy. Liver rather large but he a lthy, not congested; gall bladder full. B 357-32
?126 Spleen seemed quite disorganised; somewhat enlarged; substance of it quite broken down and pulpy like a bag of currant jelly; the glands in the adjoining mesentery not at all affected. Kidneys were healthy. Large Intestine quite healthy and contained neither pus nor blood. The lower portion of small intestine exhibited several patches of congestion and inflammation, the ileum, about a foot or 18 inches from the ccum, showed a few small circular ulcers; these were very small and shallow and not surrounded in any case by vascularity or congestion, and the bowel near them contained neither pus nor blood; one gland in the adjoining mesentery was found some- what enlarged but no induration or inflammation of 'Peyer's' patches was to be found, and the nearest portion of inflamed or congested gut was at some distance higher up. Other abdominal organs were healthy. Head not examined. This was an obscure case; it was continued fever; there were no remissions, for the slight variations in morning and evening temperature cannot be called so. The bowels were costive at first, and were so for the first 12 days of his illness. There was no diarrha at any time and when the bowels were moved the motions were, though fluid, dark and consisted of the beef tea and its fibre altered by gastric juices and contained neither blood, pus, nor mucus, and were totally different from the yellow slimy stools of enteric fever. Moreover, there was no abdominal pain, but very slight tenderness, and that only found on one occasion when it could be accounted for; no fullness or tympanitis or gurgling in abdomen and no macul though frequently looked for. The state of the spleen seems to show that the fever was malarious, and the state of the lungs would be enough in a debilitated man to account for death; so I have left the disease under its original heading Simple Continued Fever, adding Malarious. (Signed)    J. T. SHORTT, Surgeon Major, A. M. D., On consideration disease is altered in books and returns to enteric fever as ulcers in bowel leave it no longer doubtful. (Signed)    J. T. SHORTT, Surgeon Major, A. M. D." The following cases occurred in the North Staffordshire Regiment at Kar- chi, and as the correctness of the diagnosis has since been questioned, the me- dical officer who was in charge of the Regiment at the time was requested to make any remarks he might wish regarding them. He says:- "In reply 1 beg to state that all the cases were diagnosed by me as remittent fevers after a most careful consideration of all the symptoms exhibited during life as well as the appearances revealed by post-mortem examination, and I may add that the Deputy Surgeon- General who saw the cases frequently as well as the other medical officers attached to the Regiment (the latter being always present at the post-mortem examinations) concurred with me in the same opinion. After carefully perusing all the papers forwarded I still retain the same opinion that all these cases were remittent and not enteric fevers. The cases of Private Bagnell and Lamb, 2nd North Staffordshire Regiment, occurred during the time the Base Hospital was established at Karchi under the medical charge of Brigade Surgeon Lithgow. In the latter case the post-mortem appearances have not been accurately report- ed. The man died suddenly from hmorrhage; the whole of the large intestine (not the liver) was found studded with innumerable small bleeding ulcers, evidently due to scurvy; the man never suffered from dysentery while under treatment. It was this case that called my attention that scurvy was prevailing amongst the men of the Regiment which was found to be correct, and which was afterwards verified on the inspection made by Surgeon General Fogo. (Signed.)    H. M. MACBETH, Surgeon Major, A. M. D." I was the Deputy Surgeon-General referred to and am intimately acquaint- ed with the circumstances Dr. Macbeth relates, and although I quite allow that the lesions found in several of the cases were such as in England would be considered pathognomonic of enteric fever, yet for the reasons stated by Dr. Macbeth I concurred with the view held by him and all the other medical officers. The men of the Regiment were simply saturated with fever, and the scurvy Dr. Macbeth speaks of was a most ugly complication. If the disease was true enteric fever it co-existed with malarial fever and also with scurvy; but although the possibility of its being enteric fever was often discussed at the time, we believed that it was remittent fever with enteric complications and associated with scurvy. The officers attending the cases, with the exception of one young Surgeon, were old and experienced medical men, well conversant with enteric fever as seen in Europe as well as in India, and I had then and have now no reason to question the correctness of their diagnosis. The notes of some of the cases are not perhaps as full as might be desired; but the pressure at that time on the medical officers was excessive owing to an exceptionally full hospital.

?140 The following are instances of enteric fever among natives. The report of Surgeon McCalman of an outbreak in the 1st Grenadiers Native Infantry at Ahmedabad in 1878 is particularly interesting and instructive as pointing to a source of disease which used to be common in Native Infantry lines. I have ascertained from the weekly returns in the Surgeon General's office, referred to by Dr. McCalman, that there were in all five admissions from enteric fever, all of which took place in the week ending 12th April 1878, two of which proved fatal. The first death occurred about the end of the second week of the disease, and is thus noticed:- "A death has occurred in hospital from enteric fever. Towards the end there was great oppression from stuffing of the bronchial tubes, coma vigil and retention of urine, the latter being highly albuminous when drawn off. A post-mortem revealed recent pleuritic adhesions on both sides with infarction of the bases of the lungs, reddening and tumefaction of mucous membrane of bronchi (large and small) and sero-sanguinolent infiltration of the pulmonary tissue; enormous enlargement and tumefaction of bronchial and mesenteric glands. Patches of Peyer surrounded by an arterial halo and raised 2 or 3 lines above general sur- face. In the upper part of the ileum they resembled fleshy growths, oval or circular, with thickened edges and an umbilicated centre. Towards the ccum they have a reticulated or pitted appearance from rupture or ulceration of the follicles; the ulceration is superficial. Spleen much enlarged and of a dark livid colour. Pyramidal structure of kidneys much congested and capsule partly adherent." In the following week Dr. McCalman made the following remark:- "There has been one death in hospital from enteric fever. A post-mortem showed much the same pathological appearances as were observed in the preceding case." "No. 96 of 1882. FROM THE CIVIL SURGEON, RATNA'GIRI; To THE SECRETARY TO THE SURGEON GENERAL WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF BOMBAY. Ratngiri Civil Hospital, October 1882. SIR, With reference to your Circular No. 4587 of ,1882 I have the honour to state that in the early part of 1878 when in medical charge of the 1st (Grenadiers) Regiment Native Infantry at Ahmedabad several cases of undoubted enteric fever came under my observa- tion in the Regimental Hospital. I have tried to obtain extracts from the weekly reports bearing on these cases to- gether with the original diaries, but Dr. Dane informs me that all such records were lost when the Regiment was on field service in Afghanistan. However the weekly returns for the early months of 1878 are, I presume, obtainable in the Surgeon General's office, and they contain the remarks which I would now epitomise. The number of cases among the sepoys was about half a dozen and they were all in hospital at the same time. The initial symptoms observed were great prostration, muscular tremor, headache, epistaxis, a very frequent and feeble pulse, and an abnormally high temper- ature (101-104) showing a distinct morning fall and evening rise. The temperature chart in this respect was very pathognomonic. The bowels were loose and the motions a light orange colour. Gurgling in the right iliac region could always be elicited. The disease was associated with a low form of broncho-pneumonia which set in towards the second week. This, together with the extreme weakness, was always the most urgent source of the danger and it proved fatal in two cases. The post-mortem appearances, especially in one instance, were particularly character- istic, showing very extensive ulceration of Peyer's patches, catarrhal inflammation of the ileum, very decided splenic congestion and tumefaction and infarction of the mesenteric glands. The cases which ultimately recovered were treated with half drachm doses of turpentine emulsified with liquor potass. The good effects of the drug were clear and unmistakeable. The dry brown tongue rapidly became moist and clean. The diarrha was kept in perfect check; appetite improved and the skin lost its dry pungency. Deafness as a symptom was very general, and in one case it persisted till convalescence was nearly completely established
?141 two months afterwards. At the same time that enteric fever made its appearance small- pox was also prevalent in the lines. Dr. Wyllie, the Deputy Surgeon General of the Division, took much interest in the matter and together we made a most careful examination of the sepoys' huts with a view to discovering the cause of the epidemic disease. We found that the bathing water and probably matters more offensive were emptied from the interior down a narrow underground drain which passed beneath the verandah and ended in a stagnant and very offensive puddle banked with mud. In the centre of this a shrub or stick had been planted with the idea that it would help to absorb the dirty water at its base and eventually become a tree. We were of opinion that at night when the door of the hut was shut and the atmosphere inside became heated and rarified while the air of the exterior became cooled, noxious gases were drawn in from the rotting puddle outside by means of the covered drain, thus producing conditions favourable to blood-poisoning. The drains were all opened, cleansed and kept uncovered, and all stagnant water was removed. We found many of the channels partially blocked with various stinking abominations. After this no fresh case of enteric fever occurred. As regards the probable causa- tion of the fever in this instance, I particularly examined the hut of every case admitted to hospital and found the insanitary conditions of residence described. With reference to paragraph 3 of the Surgeon General's circular under reply, I think that it is sometimes most difficult to decide whether the case under observation is one of remittent or enteric fever. I have seen a case (reported from Ratngiri Jail Hospital) having at the outset all the characters of malarial fever, afterwards develop into enteric and prove fatal by bowel perforation. Had the man recovered and no complication arisen he would have been returned as 'remittent'. On the whole I should say that enteric fever in the native is more likely to be mistaken for remittent fever than vice vers. I have not observed any connection between infantile remittent and enteric fever. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, H. McCALMAN, M.D., Surgeon, Civil Surgeon." I am indebted to Surgeon Damania for the following extremely interesting case of Sepoy Bhisoo Rawool of the 19th Regiment Native Infantry stationed to Mlegaon. The portion of diseased intestine was at my request forwarded to Surgeon Major Waters, Professor of Pathology and the Curator of the Patho- logical Museum at the Grant College, who has had it mounted, and it is, I believe, the only specimen in the Museum showing the typical pathological lesions of enteric fever in a native. "Case of Enteric Fever in a Sepoy of the 19th Regiment N. I., stationed at Mlegaon. *(a). Name.-Bhisoo Rawool. (b). Caste.-Mrtha (cultivator). (c). Length of service.-2 years and 8 months. (d). Stations he had served in.-This man was a volunteer to this Regiment (19th N. I.) from the 6th R. I when that Regiment was disbanded at  Neemuch in the month of 1882.    As the 6th R. I. was at  Neemuch for about three years this man had only served in Neemuch previous to his joining this Regiment. (e). Dates of admission into hospital and periods passed in hospital. (1). Was admitted into hospital with ague on 12th April 1881 (Neemuch) and discharged to duty on 18th April 1881, being in hospital for 7 days. (2). He was again admitted into hospital with bronchitis on 19th March 1882 and discharged to duty on 23rd March 1882, being in hospital for 5 days (Neemuch). These were the only admissions previous to the last, and they were in Neemuch only. (f). Mesenteric glands were found slightly enlarged and not to such an extent as might be expected from the amount of mischief found in the intestines. (g). Ulcers, in the lower part of the ileum were more or less round in shape, but I believe they were in Peyer's patches two or three or perhaps more of them running into one another. (h). There are two wells in the lines from which men draw their drinking water, one is for the 'Mochis' and the other for the rest of the men, and it was from the latter that this man procured his drinking water. This water has not been analysed. *These remarks are answers to questions asked after the receipt of the case.-T. G. H. B 357-36
?142 History fifteen days previous to admission into hospital. Habits.-Temperate. Oaste.-Hindu, but meat-eater. He was always to be seen in the lines when not on duty and messed with two others living in the same hut with him. Was never known to have gone out shikaring or fishing or dining out with others, but used to bathe in the river every day. Age.-22 years. Physique.-Fair. Was in hospital very seldom and not for six months previous to this admission. Length of service.-Three years. As he reported himself sick on 27th March the previous history has been traced up to 12th March. 12th March.-Was not on any duty and was in the lines whole day. 13th March.-Was on Police-guard close to the lines whole day. 14th March.-Not on duty, but in the lines. 15th March.-Attended the Commanding Officer's parade as usual in the morning; no other duty. 16th March.-Was with the working party for an hour or two in the Regimental garden, which is close to the lines. There is a well in the garden, but on inquiry there was nothing to show that he drank water from that well, for all those who were working with him did not see him drinking water there. 17th March.-Was present at Commanding Officer's inspection in the morning. 18th March.-Being not on duty was in the lines whole day. 19th March.-Attended Commanding Officer's parade as usual. 20th March.-        Do.                               do. 21st March.-Was on duty at the Quarter-guard whole day. 22nd March.-Was in the lines. 23rd March.-        Do. 24th March.-Attended Commanding Officer's parade as usual. 25th March.-Was on Police-guard. 26th March.-Was with the working party pitching tents in the lines. 27th March.-Reported himself sick this morning in hospital, but as it is necessary to guard against deception, I generally only admit those patients with fever who show a rise in temperature by thermometer; and as in this case the thermometer only stood at 984, I sent him back with instructions to come back at the time when he had actually fever on. 28th March.-Though he was in the lines the whole day, being not on duty, he did not go back to hospital, but I believe he had no attack of fever, forif he had, he would have cer- tainly done so, but did so the next morning (29th March), stating that he got fever last night (28th March). 29th March.-Thermometer in the axilla registered 1022 and he was admitted. Evening temperature was 1028. 30th March.-Bowels moved twice yesterday; complains of slight headache; tongue furred but moist; no pain in the abdomen.    Temperature at 6 A.M. 992; temperature at 6 P.M. 1024. It should be admitted that the diagnosis was ague. 31st March.-Bowels moved five times yesterday. Morning temperature 1006, evening 1024. Treatment was diaphoretics and cinchona alkaloids. 1st April.-Did not sleep last night; bowels moved four times. 2nd April.-Bowels moved five times yesterday, on looking at the stool this morning which he had passed I was struck with the colour and it was exactly like pea-soup, which threw doubt in my mind as to the nature of the disease, and I commenced examining the abdomen and there was tenderness over the right iliac fossa but no gurgling. Tongue was red at the tip and furred in the centre. I ordered turpentine ms. 5 with a little sugar and water every 3 hours. As I send the chart along with this I do not see the necessity of writing temperature here. The temperature shown in the chart was always taken at 6 A.M. and 6 P.M. 3rd April.-Bowels moved four times during the day yesterday and twice during night. Pulse 115. Ordered potass bromide and chloral hydras at bed time. 4th April.-Bowels moved five times during day and four times during night. Ordered acid hydroch. dil. ms. 20, tinct. digitalis ms. 10, aqu oz. 1, every 3 hours.

?143 Pain over the right iliac region is just the same. Three small spots were noticed over the chest and abdomen. They were not rose-coloured but rather dusky and faded on pressure. This crop disappeared on about the 3rd or 4th day. 5th April.-Bowels were not moved yesterday. He was very restless during the day. 6th April.-Bowels moved twice last night. Temperature continued high. Three more spots were noticed this morning just below the left costal cartilage; tongue is moist and quite clean. Digitalis was omitted. 7th April.-Slept well last night; bowels moved four times during 24 hours. 8th April.-Slept well last night; bowels moved three times during day and not at all at night. Pulse 112. Temperature continues high. 9th April.-Slept well last night. Temperature has gone down to 102. Pulse 128. 10th April.-Bowels moved four times. Tenderness over the right iliac fossa continues just the same. Stools are all throughout copious and yellow in colour, consequently the quantity of urine passed was very small. No albumen in urine. 11th April.-Bowels moved five times during 24 hours. Urine measured 30 ozs. Pulse 118. At 11-30 P.M. he passed motion in bed, and also at 3 A.M. next day. 12th April.-Passed a very restless night. Temperature stood to 103 and 104. Passed large clots of blood in bed and fcal matter. First time distinct gurgling was noticed in the right iliac fossa. Turpentine and other astringents were ordered with stimulants if necessary. 13th April.-There were three involuntary motions passed in bed, brown in colour. He complains of pain in the abdomen. Pulse very weak and frequent. 14th April.-Had three scanty motions containing very little blood. There was low muttering delirium. Pulse weak and frequent. Ordered acetate of lead mixture. 15th April.-Bowels not moved at all. Passed urine in bed. Temperature at 9 P.M 1002, at 11 P.M. 996, from which time he began to sink. Died at 3 A.M. next morning. Post-mortem A ppearances. Brain was not examined. Lungs.-Right lung weighed 12 ozs. and was congested posteriorly. Left lung weighed 10 ozs. and was found congested. Heart weighed 3 ozs. and its walls were thin and attenuated, valves were normal, and there were clots of blood in its cavities. Liver was fatty and weighed 31/2 lbs. Spleen was normal and weighed 9 ozs. Kidneys.-Right kidney weighed 6 ozs. and cortical portion was found congested. Left kidney weighed 5 ozs. and was also congested. Intestines.-Ulceration extended within 2 feet 8 inches of the lower portion of the ileum. Commencing from below upwards where ileum passes into ccum there were four large ulcers, about the size of a rupee, just at the lower end. There was a tendency in two of these ulcers to run into two other ulcers. The margin of these ulcers was very prominent, and the surface covered with slough, yellow in colour. The ulceration seemed to extend as far as the muscular coat. Further up there was a very large ulcer, about the size of a lime. In appearance it resembled the other ulcer, Half an inch further up there was a very small ulcer. Inch and a half on the top of this there was a circular ulcer about the size of half a rupee. Two inches further up there were two small ulcers with reddened surface, and from which it was most likely that hmorrhage took place. At a distance of about an inch or half an inch there were three more ulcers, circular in shape (solitary glands). Proceeding upward we came to an ulcer, oval in shape (Peyer's patch). Between this oval ulcer and another there were three circular ulcers. The last Peyer's patch was only prominent and there was no ulceration in it. It was very prominent, rising above the surface to the extent of about three or four lines. Lastly, there was one circular ulcer at the end. In all there were 24 ulcers, 15 large and 9 small ones. No entozoa were found in the intestines. The specimen has been preserved in spirit. Remarks.-I must say that it was very difficult to trace the cause of the disease even after thorough inquiry. There are two wells in the lines from which drinking water is drawn by the men; one is for Mochis and the other for the rest. There is nothing to show that the patient had drunk water from any other source but this well. This is the first case of enterie fever that has occurred in the Regiment ever since they have come down from the Front in 1881. I am not in a position to say whether typhoid fever is prevalent in the bzr amongst the people. There is a small river close to the lines where these bzr people and men in the lines go for bathing purposes, where also clothes are washed. This river water is also used by the bzr people for drinking purposes, but not by the men in the lines. This patient used to bathe in the river almost every day, but I do not believe that he
?144 ever drank the river water. If it could be proved that he did take or use the river water for drinking purposes, we have not to go far to find out the cause of the disease. Question arises whether bathing in river is one of the causes of enteric fever? Though I am fully convinced that this man did not drink the river water, it is a fact that these people while bathing do take the water in their mouth for washing it or use it as gargle. Did this washing of the mouth by river water give rise to the fever ? The temperature chart is not quite characteristic of enteric fever as given by some well-known authors, though this was a well-marked case of enteric fever. Has climate in this country anything to do with it ? Period of incubation.-The patient was doing his duty up to 72 hours before he was taken ill. There was nothing wanting in this case that could be seen in a case of enteric fever. Cubic space of the hut in which he lived was 1,260 cubic feet.    There were two other men living with him. P. J. DAMANIA, Surgeon, 19th Regiment N. I." The third case is that of a Goanese cook-boy admitted in an advanced stage of the disease into the Sassoon Hospital. From enquiries I made from his friends I think that the days of the disease are perhaps not correctly stated in the case and temperature chart. I have attached a few notes which I took whilst trying to trace the history of the patient previous to admission into hospital, and also with refer- ence to the sanitary condition of the house in which he had resided and its surroundings. I am glad to record that on bringing its condition to the notice of the Assistant Quarter Master General, Poona Division, immediate action was taken, and it as well as the neighbourhood has since been vastly improved and much greater attention is now paid to the conservancy of the bzr; but it is a most important point to remember that the house is situated in one of the main thoroughfares of the crowded Sadar Bzr which is much frequented by British soldiers. I must also record that I have been informed by the Medical Practi- tioner in attendance that a previous fatal case of enteric fever (no post-mortem allowed) had been treated during 1881 in the same street, but higher up. I think it is extremely probable that enteric fever is endemic in the Sadar Bzr. Poona, 23rd August 1882. Juan Fernandez, aged 23, a Goanese and a cook's mate by occupation, was employed during the hot weather of 1882 at an hotel at Mthern. He returned to Poona in the beginning of June and went to reside at a Coor kept by one Zeverino DeSouza, at No. 451, Centre Street, Sadar Bzr. He took service as cook's mate under G. F. DeMello, head cook at the Napier Hotel, on the 13th June, but was discharged with his master on the 10th July, and returned to the Coor. His master was re-engaged at the hotel on the 16th July and again employed him, but he was taken sick on the 18th July and remained for 6 days in his room at the hotel where he was treated by Mr. Nazareth, L.M. He was then suffering from continued fever, but on the 23rd July his friends removed him to the Coor where he remained very ill until the 19th August, when he was taken to the Sassoon Hospital. Whilst at the Coor he was treated by pensioned Hospital Assistant Almeida. No one else in the Coor had been ill for some time previously. I inspected the Coor on the 23rd August. It is an upper-storied house, No. 451, Centre Street. A portion of it is occupied by the owner, who claims to be a wine merchant. The remaining rooms on the ground floor are let as shops; one-half of the upper story is occupied as a residence by Goanese servants out of employment. There are 20 or 30 men living in the 3 rooms, on the upper story which are en suite, the one in front of the house looks out into the street, the 2nd is in the centre, and the remaining room is at the back, from which a passage, about 10 feet long, crosses above a small backyard to a cook-room, in one corner  of which, but only shut off from the cooking place by a partition wall, which is low and not carried up to the roof, is a privy, from which most offensive emanations arise. On visiting the rear of the house to see how this privy is cleansed from the back lane, it was seen that the water from it, from the cook- room upstairs, and from the bathing places passes out into a gutter running
?145 down the centre of the lane at the back. This gutter had evidently not been cleansed for some time past as it was very filthy; in fact it was an elongated open cesspool. Khadakvsla water is laid on to the house, and there is a tap upstairs in the cook-room not far from the privy. I also visited the Napier Hotel. Juan Fernandez occupied the corner room in the servants' quarters which are situated between the cook-room and one of larger row of buildings occupied by visitors to the hotel. In this room at the time of my visit a Goanese cook was ill with fever. The floor of the room is damp from the water leaking from the bathing place in the adjoining room. The gully at the back of the cook-room is unpaved and was so wet that it was impossible to go into it. The narrow passage between the servants' quarters leading to other ranges of servants' quarters was also very wet. The servants' privy was not clean, the cesspool at the back being full of night-soil and extremely filthy. The proprietor of the hotel promises to take immediate steps to improve matters.

On opening the body, the abdomen presented evidences of intestinal congestion, and vascularity of the omentum and layer of the mesentery. The mesenteric glands were enlarged and infiltrated and about 12 ozs. of serous fluid was found in the peritoneum. The stomach and intestines were opened. The stomach was found nearly empty and healthy in appearance. The duodenum was healthy throughout its course; its internal surface was deeply stained with bile pigment. The jejunum presented marked increased vascularity and its internal coat presented marks of softening.
?148 The ileum presented a dark semi-gangrenous appearance, the colour deepening as it approached the termination of the smallintestine. Throughout the whole of the tract softening, infiltration and ulceration of Peyer's patches and solitary glands were found. The liver weighed 3lbs. 10 ozs. and presented on its upper surface marks of 4 or 5 cicatrisations, the organ was much enlarged. Both the kidneys were healthy and weighed 9 ozs. The spleen was enlarged and the capsule presented on its surface a circular thickened patch, about 3/4ths of an inch in diameter: its weight 11 ozs. The lungs were highly congested, the pleural cavity was partially filled up with serous fluid and presented the ap- pearance of splenization. The bronchial glands were enlarged and infiltrated. The weight of both the lungs was 1 lb. 12 ozs. There was 4 ozs. of serous fluid in the cavity of the pericardium. On opening the heart in the left ventricle a decolorized clot was found, in other respects the organ was healthy. E. SEXTON, Civil Surgeon, Poona."  Other cases among natives which were diagnosed to be enteric fever have been forwarded to me by Surgeon Major Sexton at Poona, Surgeon Thompson, Staff Surgeon at Mhow, and Surgeon Dalal at Karchi. In the latter case Deputy Surgeon General Pinkerton and Surgeon Major MacRury, Deputy Sani- tary Commissioner, Sind District, concurred in the correctness of the diagnosis. I do not print these cases as the patients recovered, and there was therefore no opportunity of verifying the diagnosis by a post-mortem examination. I find the following notice of a fatal case in the Jail Hospital, Ratngiri, by Surgeon McCalman, who is now Civil Surgeon there. He says:- "A case of undoubted enteric fever was admitted into this jail hospital on the 4th December 1880, and ended fatally on the 8th January 1881 from perforation of the bowel and general peritonitis. "The diary of Dhondya Goynah, male, aged 36, was afterwards sent to the Surgeon General's Office (it cannot be traced in it.-T. G. H.), and the diseased portion of the intestine retained as a pathological specimen. At the post-mortem the ileum was found gangrenous at its junction with the colon. The base of an ulcer, about the size of a shilling, had sloughed out. Perforation of another smaller ulcer had also taken place. There have been patches of recent inflammation in the lower part of the small bowel, whilst its coats generally were very much thinner and showed atrophy of grandular structure. The mesenteric glands were diseased. The real nature of the patient's illness was not at first recognised, as the symptoms for the first period resembled those of malarial fever of a severe type. I was unable to find any satisfactory explanation of its origin." The following answers to a circular which was very kindly sent at my request to all medical officers in the Civil Department by order of the Surgeon General with the Government of Bombay will be read with interest. I give them in extenso as showing that enteric fever is met with in different parts of the Presidency among natives. Cases have also in former years been reported in Native Regiments at Nasirabad and at Neemuch, and the valuable remarks by Dr. Clark, published in my report on Nasirabad, go far to show that enteric fever is endemic there:- "No. 26 OF 1882. FROM THE MEDICAL OFFICER IN CHARGE JAIL HOSPITAL, DHA'RWA'R. To THE SECRETARY TO THE SURGEON GENERAL WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF BOMBAY. Dhrwr, 20th September 1882. SIR, In reply to your Circular No. 4587 of the 31st August 1882, I have the honour to inform you that I have not observed any case of undoubted enteric fever among the native popula- tion within the last 10 years.
?149 Previous to that time, however, I have observed cases of so-called remittent fever, some of which would, I now believe, have been correctly described as enteric fever complicated with malaria. I am not in a position to state whether or no there is any connection between infantile remittent fever and enteric fever.

FROM ASSISTANT SURGEON NUSERWANJI DHANJIBHAI, IN MEDICAL CHARGE, GOKAK EXTRA-MURAL GANG; To THE SECRETARY TO THE SURGEON GENERAL WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF BOMBAY. Camp Dhoopdall, 4th October 1882. SIR, With reference to your Circular No. 4587 of the 31st August 1882, I have the honour to report that during the last ten years I have observed about 12 cases of undoubted enteric fever among the native population and in a few cases treated as remittent fever there were reasons to suspect enteric fever. The fever ran a course of 21, 28 or more days. I have seen great distension of the abdomen with hcemorrhage in two, eruption in two, and per- foration of the bowel in three cases. The eruption consisted of successive crops of a few small livid spots lasting three or four days. The other symptoms, persistent high temperature, frequency and feebleness of the pulse, diarrha, tenderness and gurgling in the right iliac region, languor, drowsiness, loss of muscular power, &c., were present in most cases. The temperature gradually rose every day for the first five or six days, attaining the maximum in the evening and falling 1 or 2 F. in the morning; sometimes the daily rise of tempera- ture was stopped by the administration of large doses of quinine or salicylic acid for a few days and again continued in spite of them. As nearly half of the cases had returned from Bombay a few days before the attack and two with fever I was unable to trace any connec- tion with the dejecta of a person who had previously suffered from enteric fever, impure water, or insanitary condition of residence. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your msot obedient Servant, NUSERWANJI DHANJIBHAI, Assistant Surgeon, In Medical Charge, Gokk Extra-Mural Gang." "No. 19 of 1882. FROM THE ASSISTANT SURGEON, VICTORIA DISPENSARY; To THE SECRETARY TO THE SURGEON GENERAL WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF BOMBAY, BOMBAY. Navsri, 26th November 1882. SIR, With reference to Circular No. 4587, dated 31st August 1882, I have the honour to state as follows :- Within the last 10 years I have seen three well-marked cases of enteric fever. B 357-38
?150 The first one occurred in an elderly Prsi priest. He was engaged in a law suit with another person, and had therefore frequently to go to Baroda and reside there for several days. The place where he used to put up was in the neighbourhood of open drains and cess- pits. On his last visit to that place he was attacked with fever of a continued type. About seven days afterwards his bowels becoming loose and the fever high, he was obliged to return to Navsri. When I visited him I found the temperature to be very high. The bowels were said to be opened about six or eight times in twenty-four hours, and the evacua- tions resembled pea-soup in appearance. There was distinct gurgling and tenderness in the right iliac region. The pulse was of a spare volume, soft, very frequent. The intellect was clear and there was no delirium. Some amount of headache, which was said to be very severe in the beginning, and deafness were present. The spleen was enlarged and felt several inches below the margin of the false ribs. A distinct and regular rise of temperature in the evening and the fall to the extent of about a degree in the morning was observed continuously for about 4 or 5 days after I visited him first, when it became stationary and remained so for several days. The liver then began to be enlarged and was distinctly felt beneath the margin of the false ribs. Notwithstanding the administration of suitable re- medies, the diarrha after a slight abatement for about a couple of days, again became worse. The tenderness which was confined to the right iliac region became more extensive, and the tongue became dry and very florid at the tip and edges. At about the middle of the third week there was great prostration with delirium. Sordes collected about the lips and gums, the abdomen was distended, tender, and tympanitic, the extremities cold, and he died about twenty-five days after the commencement of his illness. In this case no connection could be traced with the dejecta of a person who had previously suffered from typhoid fever but the disease was owing, as above stated, to the inhalation of effluvia from drains and cesspits. There was no eruption. The second case occurred in a boy of about 10 years of age. It was very clear not only as regards the symptoms that were present but also as regards the cause of the disease. It happened that he accidentally fell in an open cesspit adjoining a house, and involuntarily swallowed some of its contents. About ten days afterwards he was attacked with severe frontal headache and fever of a continued type. In a few days the characteristic evening exacerbation and the slight decrease of temperature in the morning were observed. An eruption of rose-coloured spots appeared on the chest and abdomen, and afterwards on the extremities in crops. Diarrha of a mild character set in at about the end of the first week. the stools having the peculiar pea-soup character. Deafness and latterly a good deal of pros- tration with some amount of delirium were also observed. At about the end of the third week the symptoms began to subside, and he recovered gradually in the course of about a fortnight more. The third one occurred in a Prsi girl, aged about 16 years. When I visited her, which was about six days after the commencement of her illness, the temperature was high. There was a regular rise and fall in the evening and morning respectively as was observed in my subsequent visits. At the end of the first week she was attacked with diarrha with gurg- ling in the right iliac region. The eruption appeared a couple of days afterwards. It was composed of rose-coloured spots, but not very copious. She became day by day very weak. The tongue became dry and furred. There were no sordes about the lips and gums. The temperature after remaining high for some days began to subside at about the end of the third week, when distinct remissions were observed. The diarrha was checked at about the end of the second week. The patient gradually recovered. In this case the cause of the disease could not be satisfactorily ascertained. With reference to the last para. of the above-mentioned circular I beg to state that there seems to be some connection between infantile remittent and enteric fevers. In the rainy season here the people instead of allowing the refuse water which contains urine also to flow into the cesspits, close them in order to prevent them from being filled up by the rains, consequently it flows out into the streets. Noxious emanations are thereby given off which pollute the atmosphere. At this period infantile remittent fever prevails here. It is for the most part continued, the remissions are not well marked, and takes a long course of about four or five weeks. There is good deal of prostration, diarrha in not a few cases, delirium and in the later stages partial unconsciousness. An eruption of rose-coloured spots is also observed in some instances. Deafness is also present in many cases. Very rarely such cases prove fatal. From their cause, the period of the year when they prevail, their long duration and symptoms, there is reason to believe that such cases are more of the nature of enteric than any other fever. I have no reason to suppose that in cases that have been returned as remittent fever with or without complications it would have been more accurately ascribed to enteric fever. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, JAMSETJEE BYRAMJEE, Assistant Surgeon, Victoria Dispensary, Navsri."
?151 "No. 74 OF 1882, GADAG DISPENSARY, DHA'RWA'R ZILLAH. To THE SECRETARY TO THE SURGEON GENERAL WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF BOMBAY, BOMBAY. Gadag, 29th September 1882, SIR, With reference to your Circular No. 4587 of 1882 and dated the 31st ultimo, I have the honour to report that no case of undoubted enterie fever has come under my observation among the native population,-at least none that has been verified by post-mortem exa- mination. 2.    During the last few years, however, I have on rare occasions met with a few cases among the out-door patients, which though returned as remittent fever might have been well shown as those of enteric fever, that is, if the symptoms,  the progress and the compli- cations were to be relied upon.    The most prominent,  and in a diagnostic point of view the  chief complication has  been the  intestinal lesion  as   evidenced by   the  persistent diarrhcea usually setting in during the 1st week of the occasion of the fever, with liquid yellow pea-soup like stools, tinged now and then with blood, and the presence of gurgling and pain in the right iliac fossa.    The other important complication was the lung lesion in   the form of broncho-pneumonia of adynamic type supervening during the later stage of the malady.    In no case however have I noticed any rose-coloured rash on the abdomen, the back, and the chest; but taking the dark skin of the native population into considera- tion, it is quite possible that this characteristic eruption may have escaped detection.    Nor have I had the opportunity of verifying the diagnosis by an autopsy.    With regard to the origin I have not been able to trace any connection with the  dejecta of those previously affected with enteric fever; but judging from the meagre history usually furnished by the native patients and their friends, malaria combined with insanitary conditions of the resi- dence appeared to be the principal factor in the causation of the complaint. 3.    Cases of the so-called infantile remittent  fever are not commonly met with in this country, but the few that  are occasionally  met with, with  marked intestinal  lesions,   can probably be ascribed to modified enteric fever.    Most of the cases however among infants and children returned as those of remittent type are undoubtedly of true remittent type, and they can be usually traced to malarial origin. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, D. CARDOZ, Assistant Surgeon, Gadag Dispensary." "No. 164 OF 1882. FROM THE CIVIL SURGEON, SURAT; To THE SECRETARY TO THE SURGEON GENERAL WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF BOMBAY. Civil Hospital, Surat, 13th September 1882. SIR, In reply to your Circular No. 4587, dated the 31st ultimo, I have the honour to report that among the native population of the city of Dhrwr during the monsoon of 1881, I attended five cases of what at the time appeared to me to be undoubted cases of typhoid fever. 2.    None of them were hospital patients, and although I believe the disease prevailed to a considerable extent in the city, no patient suffering from it sought relief in  the   civil hospital. 3.    Besides the five cases referred to I saw, immediately before death, three cases whose histories and condition led me to suspect that their disease might also be typhoid
?152 fever. The natives dreaded the disease very much and declared that from its great mor- tality, its prolonged duration and the bowel complication it was different from any fever they had ever seen before. 4.    Of the five undoubted cases all were young men; one was a student residing in the Government Training College, and the other four, of whom three were students, resided in various parts of the city. 5.    In one of the cases the fever came on within a fortnight after the death from fever in the same house of a sister-in-law.    This female I saw, but she had no enteric symptoms, and the pulmonary and cerebral complications which caused death were so urgent that I did not at the time suspect typhoid fever.    She died after an illness of between three and four weeks. 6.    In all the five cases the fever was ushered in by slight shivering attacks resembling ague and after invasion there were no intermissions.    The fever gradually increased in in- tensity till a temperature of about 105 was reached in the evenings.    In the mornings the temperature was less by one or two degrees.    From the begnning also there was, except in one case in which constipation existed for about a month, looseness of the bowels, the motions being characteristic of the typhoid fever.    With the diarrha there were marked tenderness and gurgling on pressure over the right iliac region, and as the disease advanced, there was tympanitic distension of the abdomen.    In one of the cases between the 20th and 30th day of the fever there were several slight attacks of hmorrhage from the bowels. In one also hmorrhage from the nose occasionally took place.    In none of the cases could any eruption be seen on the body.    The febrile state lasted for about six weeks and ended by gradual decline with free action of the skin; but even during the height of the fever profuse perspiration, especially about the head and neck, was not uncommon, but without any fall of the temperature.    During the height of the fever quiet delirium was common, and one of the patients became quite deaf and continued so for weeks after the subsidence of the fever.    One of   the   patients died   suddenly  after the fever had  subsided,   appa- rently from failure of the heart's action following an attempt to walk.    The other four recovered. 7.    I hope I will be excused from referring from memory and in  so general terms to these cases of which I possess no notes.    I did not see them so frequently as to enable me to note minutely the progress of the disease, but I looked on it as quite different from remittent fever and was strongly impressed with the belief that it was typhoid fever. 8.    From the reputed number of cases amongst the better classes and higher castes in the city I was of opinion that the disease was spread by contaminated water; but how this contamination of the water-if the fcal matter of typhoid patients be essential in the production of the disease-had originally taken place, I could form no opinion.    If, however, simple organic matter alone or the products of decomposing organic matter be sufficient to cause typhoid fever, then the explanation is very easy, for the water-supply of Dhrwr is probably more scanty and more polluted than that of any large city in the Bombay Presidency.    The large tank and the few wells in its vicinity  (which obtain their water partly by filtration from the tank) on which the city chiefly depends for its water-supply, were almost dry before the commencement of the rains, and as the tank receives the whole drainage of the large market place which stands on its banks and also part of the drainage of the civil station, besides all the filth  which  accumulates in the  water-courses   during the dry season of the year, it is little better, after the first scanty fall of rain, than an ordinary cesspool. 9.    Although I now believe that typhoid fever does exist amongst natives, I do not recollect   any   hospital   case  shown   as   remittent   fever   which  would  have   been   more correctly returned as typhoid fever; and I  am unable to give any evidence in favour of a connection between infantile remittent fever and enteric fever. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, JAMES DAVIDSON, M.B., Surgeon Major, Civil Surgeon, Surat. "Report on two Cases of ' Enteric Fever' in the Shikrpur District Jail. I. 1st Prisoner, No. 969, Dossoo valad Nawad. Caste.-Mussalmn. Male; age 30 years. Entered Jail.-16th February 1882. Occupation in Jail.-Canal clearance. Admitted into Hospital.-9th April 1882.
?153 On admission he complained of cough, fever, and pain in the right side; some days afterwards of diarrha, pain in the right iliac fossa, severe fever, cough worse with much expectoration. He died on the 12th May 1882, or 34 days after admission. Notes. The symptoms observed were continued fever of a remittent type, the evening tempera- ture being higher than the morning; pain in right iliac region with diarrha; edges of tongue red, centre furred, becoming dry and dark towards death; sordes on teeth and gums; lips parched, stupor, incoherence, and low delirium passing on to a comatose condition. Some pulmonary complications pneumonic in character. No spots were found on the body although looked for; there was no hmorrhage from the bowels observed. I find in my remarks for May last that although no spots were found 'the symptoms were unmistakeable'. No post-mortem was permitted by the deceased's friends. II. 2nd Prisoner, No. 779, Hondoo valad Billoo. Caste-Mussalman. Male; age 36 years- Entered Jail-3rd January 1882. Occupation in Jail-Gardening. Admitted into Hospital -8th May 1882. This man had been but a short time in jail when he was admitted into hospital for fever, headache, epistaxis, and pains in the limbs; this was in March 1882. He was dis- charged convalescent on the 26th April 1882. Re-admitted on the 8th May 1882. Suffering from fever, diarrha, and burning in the stomach. The peculiar fever, diarrha, iliac pain and tenderness, delirium, semi-conscious condition with wasting, pros- tration, sordes and anorexia were all present in this case as in the former. No spots were observed though looked for. No hmorrhage from the bowels was observed. I find the same remark attached to this case as was made about Dossoo-' the symptoms were, however, unmistakeable,' although no spots were found. He died on the 22nd May 1882, or 15 days after admission. No post-mortem was permitted by the deceased's friends. Remarks. In these cases there was no evidence to show any communication between the deceased and the dejecta of any person who had previously suffered from 'enteric fever' ; indeed, so far as I know, these appear to be isolated cases, no case of enteric having, so far as I am aware, been previously reported from the jail. It is equally difficult to say whether the sanitary condition of the jail or the prisoners' occupation had anything to do with inducing the disease. The water they drank was the same as that taken by other prisoners, and milk is only allowed to the sick in hospital. The question now remains as to whether its appearance was due to malaria or climatic influences. We find both cases occurring about the same time, one patient being admitted on the 9th April and the other on the 8th May, no other cases being reported before or after. This would be strong presumptive proof of the influence of season had the cases been more numerous; but the number reported being so small, it would be impossible to base a positive statement on them without some other local corroborative evidence. It is most unfortunate that autopsies were not possible in these cases. I have observed a continued form of fever in Sind, which in many of its features and symptoms resembles 'enteric':- (a.)    There is an evening exacerbation of temperature. (b.)    Diarrcea, stools light, yellowish coloured and watery. (c.)    Delirium, slight semi-conscious condition. (d.)    Tongue red at edges, white fur in centre, in bad cases becoming brown and dry. (e.)    Pulmonary complications disappearing as the fever subsides, which it generally does in favourable cases in about ten days. (f.)    There may be even abdominal pain; but the duration of the attack is as a rule much shorter, when not fatal, than that of ' enteric'; and convalescence is rapid. B 357-39-
?154 In this fever, however, which is best known as 'remittent', there is great gastric irritation in many cases with vomiting and complete anorexia. These symptoms are not general in ' enteric'; in fact there is often a craving for food in the latter. Pains in the limbs and body are frequently met with in 'remittent' and are of a most distressing character, the patient groaning with pain tumbles about, trying one position after another without relief. Prostration is common to both diseases ; it is however more marked in 'enteric' and takes more the appearance of listlessness than in the case of 'remittent', in which the patient is usually peevish and restless with rapid and shallow breathing, due very often entirely to the severity of the fever, especially during the exacerbation. The eyes not unfrequently are suffused, in other cases they have a jaundiced tinge showing hepatic disturbance. It is quite possible that from the fact of these two diseases having so many important points in common, it has happened that cases of 'enteric' fever have been returned as 'remittent'. I cannot express a definite opinion as to whether there is any connection between infantile 'remittent' fever and 'enteric'. I believe there is, more especially amongst European children in India. J. C. H. PEACOCKE, Surgeon, I. M. D., Civil Surgeon, in Medical Charge, Jail Hospital, Shikrpur. Jail Hospital, Shikrpur, 24th October 1882." The following extract from the carefully written and instructive review of the practice of the Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy Hospital for the year 1882 by Surgeon-Major Waters, 3rd Physician and Registrar, J. J. Hospital, and Professor of Pathology, G. M. C., will be read with interest:- " A certain proportion of the remittent fever cases (it would be difficult to say how many) presented some characteristics which though in several respects not those either of remittent or typhoid, yet partook of both with not a little uniformity. To this class of cases the term typho-remittent has been for some time applied with a fair show of reason; but I think, with all due respect to those who have given the designation to the combination of symptoms under notice, that for the present such a term should only be accepted in its symptomatological significance, for we may be on the eve of recognizing a febrile affection as distinct in its pathological bearing from the two diseases with which for the moment it is nosologically allied as these are from one another. It would be equally unsafe to call it Bombay fever, though, no doubt, it has only been spoken of in this city. In thermometric range this typho-remittent fever most resembles remittent fever, but in the duration of the febrile state it corresponds more to typhoid. The cerebral symp- toms are most akin to those of typhoid, but the peculiar bowel complaint associated with the grave enteric condition is not a feature of typho-remittent fever. A tympanitic condi- tion of the abdomen is not infrequently observed in typho-remittent, but the typhoid rash hardly ever. The presence or absence of a rash however is of little moment as point- ing towards typhoid or remittent, for the rose-coloured rash is frequently absent in cases of undoubted typhoid fever as seen in India among Europeans, and I myself have often noticed a very well pronounced crop of reddish spots on the skin in grave cases of remit- tent fever. As regards the treatment of the anomalous phase of febrile disease above sketched, the fact is full of significance that the most liberal use of quinine though temporarily reducing the temperature (and that not always), has no permanently salutary effect. "No case of true enteric fever was treated in the hospital during the year although the disease was unquestionably found among the European troops stationed at Colba; and from the reliable testimony I have received from medical practitioners I have no doubt that the disease also prevailed to a small extent among natives in this city. With regard to the view, now not a little canvassed, that typhoid fever in India is but a form of paludal remittent fever, I have to state that I made post-mortem examinations in 15 cases which had proved fatal from remittent fever, and in no single instance did I find the Peyerian lesion which is the pathological characteristic of typhoid. "The last year's experience of the pathological work and registration of this large hospital incline me to the belief that typhoid fever in Bombay is quite distinct from re- mittent, but that as compared with the latter it is a very rare disease." Further investigation is, perhaps, required to confirm Dr. Waters' opinion that enteric fever only prevails to a small extent among the native population in Bombay ; at all events the interesting cases published by Dr. Pinkerton of patients admitted into the European General Hospital show that it is by no means a rare disease among Europeans. It so happens that in not one of the cases in 1882 among the European troops at Colba was the disease contracted in Bombay; but the following cases

?155 of two young officers who had recently landed and who stayed in hotels widely separate are well marked cases of enteric fever.:- "Abstract of Case of Lieutenant W. G. G., 2nd Somersetshire Regiment. Age-21 years 10 months. | Service-10 months. Fever s. c.    (Typhoid). Arrived in Bombay from England on the 17th November 1882 and resided at the Adelphi Hotel, Byculla. He dated his illness to the 30th November 1882, suffering from diarrhoea and feverishness. On the 5th December he sent for the District Surgeon, whose history was that he suffered from persistent pyrexia, temperature varying from 102 to 103.9, pulse 82 to 95, intolerance of light with severe headache, insomnia nightly, congestion about the whole head, and patieht complaining of having felt slightly off his head, diarrha, anorexia, thirst, foul tongue, offensive breath and cough; aching in his loins and limbs. He seemed to think that the illness was due to mental worry about private affairs. On arrival at the Officers' Sanitarium, Colba, on the evening of 8th December, he com- plained chiefly of intense headache with intolerance of light and had high fever. The symptoms continued much the same; stools unhealthy, looking like pea-soup, one or two in the 24 hours. On the 12th December he complained of pain and tenderness over the abdomen, especially right iliac region. The stools became more frequent, of same character, and there were some suspicious-looking spots on the abdomen. On 15th December and three following days the temperature increased and the stools changed in appearance to a light coloured flaky fluid. On the 18th December stools became more greenish, bilious-looking, and next day looked like green paint. Muscular twitchings began on the 25th. On the 19th evening temperature had fallen from 103, in the morning to 101, but rose next day to 103.6, and on following day to 106 at 2 P.M. with severe rigors. The liver be- came enlarged and very tender on pressure, the belly tympanitic; passed 2 stools like beef-tea. The acute hepatic symptoms subsided and the headache which had been lately aggravated. There was crepitation with friction sounds over the lower portion of right lung, probably from continuity with liver. On the 25th December about noon there was a fresh accession of fever, temperature rising from 101.6 to 105.8 by evening, which indicated inflammation of lower portion of left lung with crepitation, friction sounds, and rusty coloured sputa. On the 31st December he passed the first healthy solid stool, and his temperature was normal all the forenoon, progressing favourably. In the afternoon, however, the temperature rose to 105.2', this time notifying an increase of inflammation of left lung, involving the lower half. The inflammation gradually subsided, the physical signs improved, and the rusty sputa disappeared after the 5th January 1883; the temperature was for the first time normal on the morning of the 8th since the last attack of inflammation, but did not become permanently normal till the 13th January. He continued to convalesce, but there still remained a little enlargement of the liver with tenderness under the false ribs. He was very emaciated, almost skin and bone, and so weak that his taking a little extra exertion on the 12th January temporarily raised his tem- perature to 102.6. He passed an Invaliding Board on the 19th January and left for England by troop-ship on the 21st January on sick leave for six months. Treatment for Fever.-Shaving scalp; blisters to nape of neck and back of head dressed with ung. hydrarg; diaphoretics, hydrobromide of quinine, resorcine, bromide of potassium and Dover's powder at bed time occasionally. For Hepatitis.-Chloride of ammonium with occasional large doses of ipecac. For Pneumonia.-Tinct. aconite, bark and ammonia, stupes. Port wine, eggs, milk and soups. Good nourishment and tonics when convalescent. R. KEITH, M.D., Surgeon-Major, A. M. D., In Medical Charge, Officers' Sanitarium, Colba, Bombay."

Arrived in Bombay from England on 17th November 1882 in good health and resided at the Colba Hotel. He first felt unwell on the 18th January 1883, chilly and feverish, with a strong pre- sentiment that he was going to have an attack of typhoid fever. He performed a post- mortem examination on a patient who died of typhoid fever in the Station Hospital, Colba, on the morning of the 27th December, and dates that as the origin of his illness. He was seen by me and placed on the sick list on the morning of the 13th January 1883. He was then feverish and out of sorts, foul tongue, bowels constipated; temperature 99.6, and in evening 103.6. On 15th January he was removed to the Officers' Sanitarium, Colba, in a dooly. On 17th January bowels were moved 3 times by ol. ricini 1/2 oz.    Morning tempera- rature 102 and evening at 9 P.M. 104.6. On 20th January bowels got more relaxed, and for the next three days there was diarrha, 4 and 5 stools in the 24 hours, some light green like paint, others light and frothy, and others yellow curdy-looking. Their character did not improve till the 31st January, when there was one semi-solid of a whitish colour, and from that date they became healthy. On the 20th a tickling cough commenced, the temperature ranged from 101 to 104.8 till the 31st January. Tongue generally foul with red edges and dry tip. On the 28th January there were a great many petechi on the right forearm like pur- pura. On the 30th January 1883 moist crepitant rales were heard over right lung accom- panied with muco-purulent sputa which on 2nd February became nummular in character. The rales were heard over left lung also on the 31st January. On the morning of the 1st February he awoke out of a good sound sleep, bathed in a cold clammy sweat, and his temperature down to 97, but the latter gradually rose in the afternoon to 102.4 at 10 P.M. The cough and night sweats were somewhat troublesome, but from the 6th February convalescence continued, and he daily improved. He was greatly reduced in flesh and strength and complained of weakness in the right leg and thigh, which were swollen and hard. He passed an Invaliding Board on the 6th March, and proceeded to Australia on the 10th of same month on 3 months' sick leave. Treatment for Fever.-Diaphoretics, carbolic acid in pill gr. 1 ter die, quinine and hydrobromic acid. Acid drinks, milk and soups. For Cough.-Inhalation of carbolic acid, linseed poultices and sinapisms, bark and ammonia; belladona gr. 1/4 doses for night sweats. During convalescence Easton's syrup and good nourishment.

?157 CHAPTER VI. From the evidence I have been able to gather there seems to be no ground for believing that the enteric fever which annually attacks and destroys so many young soldiers shortly after their arrival in India is in all, or even in the great majority of cases, due to a specific poison derived from the intestines of a previously affected person. If this source had been a common one, we may be sure that the many able officers of the Army Medical Department who have devoted such earnest attention to the subject would have succeeded in tracing such a connection. That enteric fever is met with among the native popula- tion is established beyond a doubt by the reports of the Sanitary Commis- sioner with the Government of India as well as by Sir Joseph Fayrer, and now, as regards the Bombay Presidency, by the interesting cases recorded by several medical officers. Indeed it is extremely probable that this disease will eventually be found to be much more widely spread among the natives than is at present recognized, and, in fact, in my opinion there are grounds for believing it to be endemic in many of, if not in all, our large Sadar Bzrs and native towns. That it has not hitherto attracted the especial attention of Civil Surgeons is not conclusive evidence that it does not exist. The young rarely seek admission into hospital until the disease has far advanced, and there are very great difficulties in the way of obtaining a distinct account of their antecedent history-a history, it must be remembered, which should embrace a period of at least a fortnight before the patient was first taken ill; whilst the residences from which they are brought are never visited by the medical officers, who also labour under the extreme disadvantage of being unable in fatal cases, except on rare occasions, to verify their diagnoses by post-mortem examinations, so that in cases diagnosed as continued or remittent fever there may have been enteric lesions which, in the absence of an autopsy have escaped notice. There is no doubt however that the causative agent which produces these lesions among British soldiers is very widely diffused, and is present in every station though it has attained greater virulence in some than in others. From the evidence adduced by Sir Joseph Fayrer, Dr. Morehead, and others, it would appear that there are more exciting causes for the disease in India than are re- cognized in Europe. Even those who deny malaria to be an exciting cause allow that it materially modifies the symptoms. Dr. Aitken, who strenuously denies the identity of the poison of the two diseases (enteric and malarial fevers), says: "We have to grapple with enteric fever and with malaria in all its forms in India, and it is so much the worse for the chances of recovery of the enteric patient if he is at the same time suffering from malaria in any form". For my own part I cannot help thinking that during the putrefactive changes which accompany the decomposition of nitrogenous vegetable as well as of nitro- genous animal matter ' a something' (whether a minute fungoid body or whether a bacillus I do not know) is generated, which under certain conditions of tem- perature, and especially of humidity, &c., in either air or soil assumes activity and may thus find its way into air, soil or wells, and which, if introduced into the body of any one susceptible to its influence, and especially if taken directly into the stomach and alimentary canal with food or drink, is capable of causing those lesions which are considered in Europe pathognomonic of specific enteric fever. It is a matter of observation that a water containing much albuminoid ammonia, solely derived from vegetable sources, will cause diarrha among any community which partakes of it, and I think that it is probable that in India the poison which produces malaria is in many cases, though not in all, the causative agent of these lesions. For practical purposes however the question as to whether this poison is of specific or non-specific origin is not of such supreme importance as the recognition of the fact that, of whatever nature it may be, it is connected with insanitary conditions, and that without doubt the surest way to prevent its development is to correct in every station all sanitary defects, whatever or where ever they may be. B 357-40
?158 Surgeon General Cuningham, who has for so long been the Sanitary Adviser to the Government of India, in speaking of enteric fever in his Annual Report for 1877 says:-" There can be no question as to the practical action required- the sanitary improvement of every station and the removal, as far as possible, of every defect or other evil calculated to cause disease". Among the most prominent local causes of disease malaria stands first, and all sanitary experience teaches us that that due to the condition of the ground under and near barracks and in other parts of the station itself as well as in the villages immediately adjoining it is a much more potential source than that deriv- ed from the surrounding country, although there is no doubt that marshy or sub-marshy ground to windward of cantonments is also productive of disease. It does not necessarily follow that the greatest number of admis- sions from enteric fever takes place in stations where the admission rate for malarial fevers is highest, because the incidence of enteric fever depends on the number of men present who are predisposed to it: but the tables from the vital statistics of the Army in India show that at Neemuch and Ahmedabad, where the rate for malarial fever is very high, that for enteric fever as well as for diarrha and cholera is also very high; and they also show that in Belgaum, where the malarial fever rate is lowest of all the stations, the rate for enteric fever is lowest but one, whilst the rates for cholera, dysentery and diarrha are also very low. Next to malaria come the filthy conditions which are ordinarily met with everywhere in India, and these must be considered as potent exciting causes of enteric fever and other diseases. The filth, inseparable under present circum- stances from Sadar Bzrs and immediately adjoining villages, is an unceasing and ever active source of danger to troops. I fully recognize, as I have said in a preceding chapter, that the Cantonment Magistrates do all they possibly can, with the limited means at their disposal, to keep the Sadar Bzrs as clean as they can; but the evils they have to contend with are so numerous, the customs of the natives are so filthy, and the means for effecting real improvement so imperfect, that they can do little else than see to the removal of the grosser impurities. It thus happens that soldiers visiting these places breathe tainted air and foul air blowing over a foul population group is frequently carried into barracks, whilst foul dampness under and near barracks, damp barracks, wrongly constructed and imperfectly ventilated latrines, cesspools, &c., are sources of great danger. Food exposed to emanations from night-soil, &c., water accidentally polluted with filth, milk mixed with impure water, &c., are all potent exciting causes; whilst anything that tends to lower the general health of the men must also powerfully predispose to disease. It will now be my duty to indicate the measures which in my opinion are desirable to reduce the great mortality and the greater loss of service entailed by enteric fever on the State. It has been shown that soldiers who by their young age are peculiarly pre- disposed to this disease are sent out with every draft in spite of the Queen's regulations that only men who have attained the age of 20 years should be sent out from England to India. The action necessary to stop this injurious practice must be put in force in England; but it is very hard that the express directions of Her Majesty are so systematically set aside. I presume according to the regulations medical officers are consulted before each draft is sent out; but I have no doubt that they pass the men for service in India under the impression that there is a great demand for their services ; and in my experience soldiers, when asked their age, frequently, if they have an object in doing so, make themselves out older than they really are. If I were asked what single measure would be best calculated to prevent the occurrence of enteric fever in the Army in India I should say : Do not let men land in the country until they have attained the age of 25 years. This advice has been repeatedly given by the Army Sanitary Commission, and in the report on the causes of reduced mortality in the French Army serving in Algeria it is said ; "Experience in Algeria has confirmed the recommendation of the Royal Commis-
?159 sion that healthy, fully formed soldiers should alone be sent on service to warm climates. It appears to be the conviction in Algeria that the best age for a sol- dier to arrive in the country is 25". I fear that under existing conditions of short service this course may not be possible. But I certainly think that no men under the age of 22 ought to be sent to India, and even if this were done, their liability to attack would for the first three years of their service in India still be great. The sanitary condition of the troop-ships is a matter of the most vital im- portance, and in my opinion a special report should be made, on each occasion, be- fore they leave England or India. I have no means of knowing whether this is now done; but in case it is not, I urge the importance of this course being pursued. The troop decks, &c., should be thoroughly fumigated with nitrous acid or chlorine before troops are taken on board; and it should be remembered, as Dr. Blyth points out, that "chemical gases will act better in the presence of moisture than in the dry state. On this account Dr. Budd has proposed, that when a room is to be disinfected, a little time before the disinfection a tub of boiling water should be placed in it, so that the steam may wet the walls and air, as he thinks there is a danger of gaseous disinfectants not destroying the germs if they are in a dry state". The next point is that regiments on first arrival should be sent to selected stations. I strongly recommend that all young soldiers under the age of 25 be sent, on first arrival, to a hill station. Bombay is in my opinion treated somewhat un- fairly in this respect; in Bengal and also in Madras there are hill stations to which European troops can be sent; but though we have sites in this Presidency second to none, yet there is no station in the hills for our British soldiers, and the accommodation at our so-called hill sanitaria is very limited. General Sir Robert Phayre, when Quarter Master General of the Army as long ago as 1862, recommended Mundurdeo as a fitting place for the location of troops. I have never been there, but from General Phayre's admirable report I have no doubt it would form an excellent site. In my opinion too the neigh- bouring spur, Pnchgani, would also be a convenient and good site; and we know that it is healthy, as Europeans have for many years past continuously lived there all the year round. Although only 12 miles distant from Mahbaleshvar where the rain-fall is 237 inches, the annual fall of rain at Pnchgani is only 56 inches. If all young soldiers on first arrival in the country were kept at Pnchgani for their first three years of residence they would be placed under favourable conditions to escape disease, and would become acclimatized and therefore better able to resist it on going down for service in the plains. In such a climate they could be made to work without danger to their health. There would be no reason why they should not be employed, as the French soldiers are in Algeria, in the execution of public works, such as sub-soil draining the site, in building barracks and making roads, in cooking their own food, in washing their clothes, &c., and, in fact, in doing everything for themselves, and thus surely in becoming more efficient soldiers. It may be said that the Bri- tish soldier is not enlisted to perform such work; but if up to this time he has not been, it is no reason why for the future he should not in this respect be as- similated to soldiers in continental armies. In any military settlement on the hills the greatest care should be taken to limit the public followers to the very least number of men whose services are ab- solutely required. No native woman should be allowed to live within the canton- ment without a pass from the Officer Commanding, Among such, I fear, it would be absolutely necessary to include a few licensed prostitutes; and in laying it out a point which has so frequently been neglected in existing canton- ments, viz., its possible extension in future times, should be borne in mind. A co-operative store under the management of an especially selected non-commis- sioned officer might advantageously supply the place of a Sadar Bzr.
?160 Such a scheme would afford a grand opportunity of laying out a model station, and I am confident its establishment would in a very few years tell most favourably on the health of the Bombay Army. For the northern division of the Army and for the troops in Rjputna Mount Abu could be utilized; but the recent outbreak of enteric fever at that station teaches us in the most forcible language that without due observance of sanitary principles the very healthiest site must infallibly, by their neglect, be followed by the outbreak of preventible disease. Asirgarh, too, is a most valuable small hill station for the troops at Mhow. The next best plan after hill stations would be selected stations in the plains. From the tables given in the Mhow report it is seen that Nasirabad, Karchi, Neemuch and Ahmedabad have an exceptionally high rate of admissions from enteric fever. At Mhow, Stra, Indore, Baroda and Deesa there is also a high admission rate. I cannot therefore but think that regiments on first arrival in this country should not be sent to any of the above stations until the disease- producing causes have been removed. It would surely be the wiser course to let them become acclimatized in the most healthy stations before proceeding to an unhealthy one. Judging by the admission and death-rate of the 10 years, Belgaum is by far the healthiest station in the Bombay Command. In fact although there was not the lowest death-rate from enteric fever, yet there was the lowest death-rate from all causes in it during the 10 years of all the stations in India in the plains. Next to Belgaum comes Ahmednagar. The enteric fever rate is indeed slightly higher at Ahmednagar than at Poona and Kirkee and Hyderabad in Sind, but the admission rate from all causes and the death-rate in it is far lower. If a newly arrived regiment must be quartered at Poona, it should be located in the Wanowri Barracks and not at Ghorepuri. Bombay has the lowest rate of all the stations for admissions from enteric fever, and although the admission rate from all causes is very high and the death- rate is also high, yet these results are caused by the number of convalescents and invalids who pass through the dept; but as the Regiment at Colba furnishes detachments to Baroda, Ahmedabad and Deesa, I strongly recommend that if not sent to the hills newly arrived regiments be sent to Belgaum or Ahmednagar. Regarding the action required in stations I can only say it is my most firm conviction that very much of the sickness from which British soldiers in India suffer is not produced by climate (although I fully admit this to be one of the predisposing causes), but disease in this country is in my opinion to a very great extent the result of local insanitary conditions which, if removed, would enable the men to enjoy as good health as they now do in the West Indies, " where, in some stations, e. g., Trinidad and Barbadoes, the sickness and mortality among the European soldiers are actually less than on home service in years which have no yellow fever."-Parkes. It must not be thought that I do not fully recognize the great advance in sanitary matters that has been effected during the last 25 years. Thanks to the Royal Sanitary Commission, the eyes of Government were opened to the un- satisfactory state of the Army and great improvements have taken place. Nor do I ignore the great and unceasing care that is taken in every regiment and station to enforce cleanliness in every way possible with existing means. The local causes I refer to are for the most part beyond the power of officers commanding stations to remedy. For example, in India such a thing as the under- draining of a site previously to habitation is never even thought of, and yet there is no country in the world where such action is more required. Major Galton, late R. E., in his excellent work recently published and entitled "Healthy Dwellings", says: "The condition which more than any other governs the healthiness of the soil is the relation which the ground air or air in the soil bears to the ground water, that is to say, the presence or absence of moisture in the soil"; and, again, "If the ground is to be permanently occupied, not only the area to be built on, but an area extending to probably 100 yards round it on
?161 every side should be thoroughly underdrained and the mouths of the drains so arranged as to allow the aeration of the soil as well as the removal of the sub-soil water. Dwellings should be raised above the level of the ground and provided with a ventilated air space underneath". These are no theoretical views. They are the expressions of an acknowledged authority, and similar advice has been urged at every opportunity by the Army Sanitary Commission and by the sanitary advisers to Government as one of the surest means of improving the health of British soldiers ; but as the soundness of this advice may be called in question, it is as well to give still further evidence on the point. Dr. Ford, President of the Board of Health, Philadelphia, in his chapter on 'Soil and Water,' published in Buck's work on Hygiene and Public Health, says :- "The extensive works for draining the sub-soil undertaken in all civilized countries for the advancement of agricultural projects have incidentally exerted a very beneficial influence upon the public health. The construction of sewers for the purpose of removing the surface water and the liquid refuse of towns has had the important effect of diminishing mortality, which effect is largely attributable to the drying of the sub-soil by lowering the ground water. The investigations of Dr. Buchanan with the object of determining the influence of the sewerage works of England on the public health have demonstrated this fact beyond a doubt. The following table shows the general improvement which has taken place in the health of twelve towns in consequence of drainage operations :- Name of Place.  Population in 1861.

The above results refer to towns in England, and it may be said that because this course has been successful in an English climate, it does not necessarily follow that the same results would be attained in a country like India where the climate is so different. If so, the following extract from the report of the Committee of Inquiry appointed by the Secretary of State for War in 1865 (Earl de Grey and Ripon) into the sanitary arrangements in force amongst the French troops in Algeria, will be a sufficient answer :- "It is our decided opinion that French experience in Algeria has shown that it is absolutely necessary to adopt drainage and improved agriculture in India and other tropical countries as the basis of their health arrangements, and that the required organisation for draining and for improving the agriculture of that great country must be introduced. These measures, indicated by the Royal Commission for diminishing malaria in India and other warm climates, cannot be said to rest any longer on theoretical considerations. Their practical results may be seen in Algeria. In all warm countries malarial disease is proof of the presence of malaria, but is also proof of unused riches in the soil. Make use of the riches and the malaria will cease to be of importance. This ought to be one of the main objects of Government in countries where the population suffers from malaria. "Probably the best way of accomplishing these great improvements would be for the authorities in India and in other warm climate colonies to execute the main drainage works in agricultural districts and to give every encouragement to the introduction of improved implements and methods of cultivation. B 357-41
162 "We are decidedly of opinion that these improvements are perfectly practicable where- ever they are required. In carrying them out the best plan would be to begin by draining the military stations, by draining the country around them, and by selecting the kind and improving the character of the agriculture to be carried out there, and then to extend the work over the country. Experience in Algeria has proved that the general malaria of a country is much less prejudicial than is the local malaria of stations and villages and of the villages immediately surrounding them. It is there indeed that the problem has to be dealt with in the first instance : but the work should not stop there; it should be commenced with the intention of finally benefiting the whole population of the country." The case of Boufaric, quoted by the Commission, is a most remarkable one as showing what an amount of good, deep sub-soil pipe drainage has on the health of the inhabitants. It is thus referred to by Dr. Parkes :- "Successive races of soldiers and colonists had died off and the station had the worst reputation. Deep drainage was resorted to, the level of the ground water was lowered 20 inches or more. This measure and a better supply of drinking water have reduced the mortality to one-third." Why cannot the action which has proved so successful in Algeria be carried out in India ? The diseases, according to Dr. Parkes, which have been attributed to telluric effluvia are- "Paroxysmal fevers. Bilious remittent fever. Enteric fever. Cholera. Yellow fever. Dysentery. "Enteric fever has also been supposed to be connected with changes of the moisture of the soil owing to rising and falling of the ground water. Professor Pettenkofer's observations on the wells of Munich led Buhl to the discovery that in that city there is a very close relation between the height of the ground water and the fatal cases of typhoid. The outbreaks of typhoid fever occurred when the ground water was lowest and especially when after having risen to an unusual height it had rapidly fallen. "Deep soil drainage (the drains being from 8 to 12 feet deep and 10 to 20 feet apart) is useful in all soils, except the most impermeable, and in the tropics should be carried out even in what are apparently dry sandy plains."-PARKES on Hygiene. The italics are mine. Mr. Baily Denton in his work on Sanitary Engineering says that :- "The maintenance of pure air by the underdrainage of the soil surrounding and beneath dwellings is an object only inferior in importance to the removal of putrescible matters. That this object is one of the most important that can engage the attention of the sanitary engineer cannot be denied when it is shown, on the authority of Dr. DeChaumont, that long exposure to bad air tends to the production of scrofula and consumption, of which latter disease it is probably the most efficient cause; that it promotes enteric fevers; that it fosters attacks of the respiratory organs, such as catarrh, bronchitis, and pneumonia ; but it is frequently the cause of inflammation of the eyes, and that it adds to the spread of small-pox, measles, scarlet fever and the like, while it renders the rapid cure of wounds and sores of all kinds a work of great difficulty." Our greatest authority on engineering questions in India, Mr. Rawlinson, says :- "The next question of importance in the improvement of stations is the extent to which sanitary methods and appliances suitable for barracks in Europe would answer for barracks in India and in tropical stations generally. "It is possible, e. g., to sub-soil drain any extent of ground in England, and this process is attended not only with increased productiveness, but with improved health. Whenever sub-soil water comes within a certain distance of the surface of the ground it interferes with healthy vegetation and generates damps, fogs and malaria, which have been found to diminish or disappear when the water level has been lowered by drains. "The universal prevalence of malarial disease at Indian stations indicates a malaria- generating condition of the earth, and one of the first improvements required is to diminish or remove this condition." There is thus the collective testimony of Sanitary Officers and Sanitary Engineers as to the absolute importance of aerating and drying the sub-soil of inhabited areas. The diagram attached to the report I have lately submitted on Mhow proves for how long a time a sub-soil in India will remain wet, and I am confident that in every station the condition of the ground under and around barracks at the termination of the rains, when the temperature is still high and the water level begins to sink, is a most fruitful source of preventible disease.
163 I am equally confident that until measures are taken to reduce moisture in the soil and to allow its free permeability by air at all seasons of the year, the efficiency of the Army will be, as now, year after year impaired by preventible sickness. The question of dealing with malaria-producing sources beyond the limits of cantonments is a much more difficult matter, and I quite allow that it would be out of the power of Government to undertake at once the sub-soil drainage of vast tracts of territory. I fear that this great source of much of the disease among the native as well as among the European population is without practical remedy; but if Government were to set the example in camps, and by so doing demonstrate to the people of India the great advantage to be derived from such a course, I have no doubt that in course of time, though this may perhaps be still far distant, such action will surely be taken. England itself two or three centuries ago was an intensely malarious country. " James I. and Oliver Cromwell, says Murchison, both died of ague; and the latter of these rulers, speaking of ague, makes use of the following oft-quoted words: matrem pietis- simam, fratres, sorores, ancillas, nutrices, conductitias, quotquot erant intra eosdem nobiscum parietes, ac fere omnes ejusdem ac vicinorum pagorum incolas, hoc veneno infectos et decumbentes vidi. The country surrounding London was in Cromwell's time as marshy as the fens of Lincolnshire now are. But at the present day owing to the almost universal drainage and cultivation of the soil agues have, save in a few isolated districts, almost vanished from this country." I cannot but believe that as education spreads the intelligence of the natives will lead them to adopt similar measures, but they cannot be expected to believe in the benefits conferred by underdraining a soil, unless Government sets the example. For the present the only practical course with reference to in- sanitary conditions of the country beyond the limits of cantonments appears to be that due care should be taken in the selection of the site of barracks and to see that they are not unusually exposed to malaria-producing causes arising beyond the boundaries of the cantonment. Something may perhaps be effected by the extension of tree planting and in paying especial attention to keeping the main channels of the surface drainage free; but beyond this I fear but little can at present be done. It surely requires no argument to prove that a damp barrack must be an unhealthy barrack. Roofs which leak should be reconstructed, whilst the verandahs should be protected from rain beating in. Gutters round the eaves of the roofs are required to prevent the storm water dripping from them, and the roof water should be carried to a distance from the barracks through an impervious channel. It is too late now for measures to be taken to provide air perflation under the ground floor of barracks; but the top layer of the solid matter with which the plinths are filled might be taken out for a certain depth and be filled in, as suggested by the Army Sanitary Commission, with good Portland cement con- crete. Many of the barracks are injudiciously ventilated, the men being exposed to draughts whilst lying on their cots. If the doors recommended by the Army Sanitary Commission and by Mr. Lumsdaine were to be constructed, much of this would be obviated. Iron receptacles below the spouts for bathing rooms in barracks should not stand in masonry pits but on the ground, the plinth ought always to be of sufficient height to allow of this arrangement, but in many of the barracks it is too low. In such cases a low but long receptacle might be made to catch the bath- room water, or, better still, it should be discharged direct into the puckaul. No wash-houses should be under the same roof as the dormitories, and in barracks, where this is the case, separate wash-houses should be provided. The wastage water from the wash-houses should not be deposited on the ground; it might be utilized in watering roads if it cannot be carried through a drain to a distance. I regard, as I have previously said, the present standard latrine as a distinct disease cause, and I consider it to be very probably one of the sources of enteric fever.
?164 It is the one place which men from different barracks are sure to visit, and I am certain that it is at all events a source of danger. In some of the latrines, in spite of every care on the part of the Quarter-Master of the Regiment, the smell is sicken- ing, and it is not to be wondered at on account of the want of efficient ventilation. In my opinion in every respect the existing latrine is utterly bad, and I recommend that the principle of Colonel Goodfellow's Karwar pattern latrine be adopted.   The roof to be supported by wooden uprights whilst bamboo battens are fixed between each upright for a height of from 4 to 5 feet, a clear air space of about 2' 6" or 3'  being left between  the top  of the battens and the roof.    The greatest care should be taken that no lime or masonry is used in the  building.    The support for the wooden seat, if there must be a seat, being made of cut stone.    I should prefer that there was no seat, as in course of time the under-surface of the wood, from the organic vapour itis exposed to, becomes rotten, or, at all events, damp.    Men on the line of march perforce adopt the squatting posture, and it would be better if a seat could be done away with. The iron receptacles below the seat are in my opinion likely to be a disease source for reasons previously stated, and I suggest that glazed earthenware vessels be used instead. They are perishable, but in this lies their safety, and they are exceedingly cheap. The passage behind the seats should, as well as the surface inside theprivy, be covered with asphalt. In my opinion it is not safe to keep these iron vessels in the passage behind the latrine; they should, I think, be kept at the manure yard, where they should be at once thoroughly cleaned after being emptied, and only be brought to the latrine to remove the ordure from the pans. If Government cannot sanction the earthenware pans, then I recommend that the iron pans in latrines, urinals and those used for conveyance of the ordure be at stated periods, say once in three months, made red-hot so as to burn off any offensive matter sticking to them. I also recommend that the ashes of cutchra after sieving be used in the pans instead of dry earth. They possess deodorising powers, and the compost is much more valuable for manure; and if, as I think it should be, a self-acting hopper were fixed above every seat the ashes could not be as likely to clog as the dry earth. In stations, such as Kirkee, Poona, Nasirabad, Hvderabad, Bombay, &c., where there is a plentiful supply of water brought in from a distance, the refuse water from bath, cook and ablution rooms, as well as the night-soil and urine from the latrines could beremoved with in finitely greater efficiency and with incalculably less danger to health through glazed pipe sewers than by the clumsy and expensive hand removal system now in force. As previously stated the disposal of the dry refuse, stable litter, &c., and night-soil is in many stations conducted not according to sanitary principles. At Karchi, for example, a Committee, of which I was a member, did its best to obtain sanction for poudrette to be made instead of the night-soil being stored in pits and the dry refuse heaped up, but the small expenditure required for main- tenance of the labourers to work the system prevented the authorities who, of course, have to limit expenditure, according their sanction. I can only repeat that this system would, for health considerations, in the absence of a water carriage system for the removal of the night-soil, be undoubtedly the best and infinitely better than the present arrangements; whilst by it the refuse is preserved for application to the land as manure, and I am quite sure cultivators, as at Poona, would soon learn its value for agriculture, although regulations would be required not to permit its application to land within a certain radius of the cantonment. In all cases the dry refuse should be burnt and reduced to ashes instead of being stored to undergo slow decomposition, Regarding the water-supply I can only say that there can be no safety until the directions of the Army Sanitary Commission regarding covering over wells and providing a casing of cement outside the tubes for a depth of 20 feet are carried out. I am fully aware that Government and the Military authorities never lose an opportunity of improving the source of supply when there is the chance, but I wish in this chapter to bring again to prominent notice the evils connected with the distribution of the water to the troops.
?165 In my opinion the bhistis' musuck should at all events in cantonments be once and for ever discontinuedand galvanized iron vessels substituted for it, and for the wooden barrels in cook-rooms, and, as a matter of daily routine, all vessels used for carrying water should be daily cleaned and regularly inspected every day by a responsible officer. By present arrangements there is no guarantee that the bhistis do not use the musucks in which they have carried pure water to the barracks for the conveyance of water from other sources. It would add much to the comfort and health of the men if the vessels in which the Macnamara filters are placed consisted of porous earthenware, like, for example, the large vessels in use in Turkish Arabia, in which the water becomes by evaporation deli- ciously cool. I also think the sand in the filters should be supplied by the Execu- tive Engineer and not by the Commissariat Office. It is not an easy matter to procure clean river sand near every station, and the Executive Engineer is much more likely to know where such can be obtained. The condition of the Sadar Bzrs throughout the Presidency will never in my opinion be satisfactory until a different system of working the sanitary clauses of the Cantonment Act is sanctioned. I venture to say that it is impossible that real practical sanitation can in a large Sadar Bzr be efficiently carried out with the present cumbrous machinery. The Cantonment Magistrate is not only the complainant but the Judge; at Karchi for some time he was also in charge of the jail, so that he would have had custody of any person he had committed to prison under Section 29 of the Act after conviction by himself on a charge he himself had made. The Cantonment Magistrate under the rules is required "personally to inspect all parts of the Cantonment at least once a month, especially those parts of which the sanitary supervision is important, and to require his subor- dinates frequently to do the same." But this is exactly what I think is not re- quired. For practical sanitation it is necessary that the officer entrusted with these duties should be out every day and should inspect the greater portion of his charge every day. The Cantonment Magistrate's duties are so onerous that he cannot, however devoted, give that amount of personal supervision which is so essential. I also venture to state my opinion that the Officer Commanding the station should be provided with an executive staff consisting of a Medical Officer of Health, an Executive Engineer and a Secretary who might be also the Con- troller of Accounts. I regard the appointment of a Medical Officer of Health as all-important. His duties would consist in supervising the sanitary condition of barracks and regimental lines and in placing himself in communication with the medical officer in charge of the troops who would keep him informed of the occurrence of any case of cholera, small-pox, enteric fever, &c., so that he might at once set to work to trace the cause. This most important duty which requires much time and much careful investigation now falls on medical officers at the very time when their presence at hospital is most urgently needed by the patient; and though I bear most willing testimony to the great zeal they have ever displayed, I am very fully cognizant of the great demand that is made on them and can well un- derstand that owing to pressure of curative work they have not in all cases been ableto spare the time to trace up the antecedent circumstances of each indivi- dual case; yet, I think, the importance of tracing the previous history of each enteric patient cannot be over-estimated. The Health Officer would keep the most rigid supervision over the condi- tion of the Sadar Bzr and summons an offender against the sanitary clauses of the Act before the Cantonment Magistrate who would only have magisterial duties. Speaking as an old Health Officer I can testify to the advantage of there being an entirely unbiased Magistrate to decide cases on the evidence ad- duced. He would also have charge of the vital statistics of the station, vaccination, &c.; and I would propose that he should also be in charge of the Lock Hospital. One of his chief duties would be to inspect the food supplies and to analyse the water which the troops use and also that in the bzr, as well as milk and other beverages sold there. He would inspect the stables where the cows and milch buffaloes are kept and livery stables, &c. At Poona, for example, the Sadar B 357-42
?166 Bzr is really a large and important town containing 20,000 inhabitants, and though I fully acknowledge the devotion, energy and capacity displayed by the very zealous Cantonment Magistrate at present in charge, yet I am sure if there were a Health Officer appointed he would have ample work to occupy his whole time. There is also a considerable urban population in the Sadar Bzrs of Belgaum, Deesa, Nasirabad and Mhow, and also at Karchi, though this is at present unfortunately not under military control. If such an officer were appoint- ed at each of these places I have no doubt that great improvements would be effected. Taxation having, I am glad to say, been at length imposed on the residents in Cantonments it seems to me that a small corporation might be established, consisting of Commanding Officers to represent the Military element and of rate-payers to represent the non-official classes. The Officer Commanding the Station would still be President, and the corporate body would hold quarterly meetings to decide questions of general administration, to sanction expenditure, pass budgets, &c. I am sure the time has come when some such scheme is needed, and if Government were pleased to sanction it being tried in Poona in the first instance, it could, if found successful, be extended to other stations. There is a point regarding Military stations which I think it is desirable to bring to especial notice, and that is, the necessity for establishing in each station a laundry where the clothes of soldiers should be washed, dried and ironed. At present the regimental Dhobies carry away the dirty clothes to the river or well for washing and afterwards remove them to their own houses for ironing, &c. The Officer Commanding the 17th Lancers recognises the danger of this, and insists on all the clothes being ironed in one of the regimental buildings. I well remember the condition of some of the houses in the Dhobi Ght at Karchi when cholera was prevailing among the Dhobies there resident and I cannot but regard existing arrangements as likely to spread disease. The bedding and all clothes that have been used or worn by any soldier suffering from enteric fever, as well as from certain other diseases, should be exposed to hot dry air at a high temperature in a disinfecting chamber. There is not a single disinfecting chamber in the Presidency, and I can speak from personal knowledge of the difficulty experienced by medical officers in getting clothing, bedding, &c., disinfected. Until a disinfecting chamber can be built I think these articles should be, if possible, baked in an oven, or, if there is no oven, that they should be boiled with some disinfectant, of which chloride of zinc is probably the best. All barrack-rooms from which cases of enteric fever have been admitted into hospital should, after disinfection by burning sulphur, be lime-washed; and I especially recommend that all latrines be, as a matter of regular routine, dis- infected and lime-washed in a similar manner once a month. I also recommend that a record of the disease statistics regarding cholera, enteric fever, malarial fever, dysentery and diarrha be kept for individual barracks in each lines and that the disease statistics be kept by corps as well as by stations. It was for this purpose that,while actingas Sanitary Commissioner, I asked Govern- ment to introduce the sanitary reports for each station. It will be of little use to keep the statistics by the station as a whole. What is required is much more minute sub-division, so that we may be able to see what lines in the station are healthy or the reverse, and not only this, but what barracks are more unhealthy than others, and in this way to localize disease.* The individual care of the young soldier is another matter of the highest im- portance. Medicalofficersare sometimesdistressed to find that men suffering from enteric fever have not reported themselves sick until they were utterly unable to keep out of hospital any longer, some of whom die a few days after admission, and it is clear that these men must have had the disease on them for days before they came to hospital. "It is not uncommon," according to Dr. Murchison, " for patients to continue at theirordinary employment for the first week or ten days, or * Since the above was written I have received instructions from the Quarter-Master General to prepare forms which will embody this information.
?167 even to walk to hospital up to the end of a fortnight"; but I think in the Army it is very necessary that the first indication of the disease should be detected. The ordinary inspections held weekly by a medical officer of the troops in each station are not and cannot be sufficiently searching to discover latent disease, and only such men who are so manifestly ill as to attract attention are sent to hospital, whilst at the time of inspection many men are absent on guard, fatigue duty, &c. I think therefore it is extremely desirable that a special weekly inspection should be made of all young soldiers for the first year of residence in the country, and that all such should attend hospital on a given day and be carefully examined, so that any of them about whosestate of health the medical officer entertains the slightest doubt could have their temperatures taken, &c., and, if necessary, be detained for observation. This seems to be more especially import- ant, as since the establishment of the station hospital system the medical offi- cers have not the same opportunity as when the regimental system was in force of knowing the habits and constitution of each individual man in the corps, and are therefore unable to keep the same watchful supervision over any particular man as formerly. Indeed in my opinion it would be well always to attach a medical officer to each corps (though the men would still be treated in the station hospital), as by so doing he would be in a much better position for watching over the health of the men and the sanitary condition of the lines and barracks. At the ordinary weekly examination of corps I would suggest that the especial attention of medical officers be invited to the condition of the men's gums to see whether there was any scorbutic taint. I also think that it should be a standing order that all men suffering from even slight diarrha should invariably attend hospital. The enteric fever patient from the moment he is admitted into hospital requires incessant nursing. At present he is attended by orderlies who may or may not be attentive to his wants; but it is much to be wished that the services of trained nurses were available in this country and that there was a staff of such attached to each Station Hospital. The incalculable benefit of good nursing is seen in the J. J. Hospital, where the Sisters from All Saints' Home attend so zealously the native sick, and, if our soldiers, when in hospital, could have similar nursing, it would add not only immensely to their well being, but would prove of inestimable assistance to the Medical Officer, who would then be sure that his directions regarding food, medicine, &c., were carried out. Improvement is likewise required in the cooking in hospitals. It is at present very rough, but a higher scale of pay must be allowed before better cooks would serve in hospitals. Government in its Resolution, Military Department, No. 760, dated 9th February 1881, says:- "Another point deserving of consideration and which Government desire to bring under the notice of His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief is the necessity for proper steps being taken to make men change their under-clothing after being dismissed from parade, such as making them parade in their rooms a few minutes later after having changed it. The im- prudence of young soldiers in this respect is notorious, and the desirability of steps being taken to teach them better is obvious." I would also suggest that at evening roll-call the men parade in dry flannel vests. I am sure that the cause of much illness is often to be ascribed to men getting heated by probably doubling back to their barracks to be in time for roll- call and lying down with the skin in an active state of perspiration. They cool down in bed and get a chill. All men are now ordered to wear flannel shirts, but on visiting some barracks the number of men wearing cotton ones attracts attention. Some men wear a flannel vest under the shirt, but many do not. In most cases the flannel shirt is left open in front. I think the body dress of the blue jackets in the Royal Navy is admirably adapted for work in a hot climate, though I suppose it is too loose for military approval; but the more the dress of soldiers can be assimilated to it the better for health, as it leaves the neck free and also affords a good protection to the chest and abdomen. At some stations during the monsoon a knitted Cardigan jacket which might have calico sleeves would B 357-43\?\
?168 be a useful addition to the dress, and an extra blanket is also desirable at that season. At the military prison at Poona, for example, the wind during the mon- soon is very cold towards morning, and one blanket is in my opinion not sufficient. It would be a good plan to have printed directions hung up in every barrack- room to teach young soldiers what especial dangers they should avoid. The men will not tell of each other, but it should be somebody's duty to inform the non- commissioned officer in charge of the room when any man does not eat his food for more than a day. One of the most important sanitary measures that could be introduced would be the abolition of the spirit ration, which is the most fruitful source of disease, and which I have no doubt is the cause of a good deal of crime and is also a power- ful incentive to vice. The Army Sanitary Commission has long and powerfully advocated this measure and the Adjutant General of the Army in a remarkable minute quoted by the Commission in the XIVth Volume states that young soldiers are in point of fact taught, under existing regulations, to drink spirits. Nothing I can say can be stronger. I can only hope that measures will be taken not only to discontinue the sale of spirits in canteens, but also to prevent, as far as possible, their sale in Sadar Bzrs and in the villages round cantonments; or, if spirits must be sold in bzrs, that they be reduced by the addition of pure and filtered water to at least 30 per cent. below present strength. The dull, heavy porter now supplied is, I am confident, a source of disease, and the substitution of light Vienna or other German beers, as recommended by the Army Sanitary Commission, would not only tend to great improvement in the health of the British soldier, but would also exercise a marked influence in rendering him less predis- posed to attacks of disease. If tobacco less strong than black Cavendish could be provided for the men it would lead to their better health. Cigars of Indian manufacture are now almost universally smoked by officers and civilians in India. Why could not the experi- ment be tried of providing Indian cheroots for the men ? There is but little doubt that the manufacturers would make a substantial reduction in the present prices if they had the promise of the large supply that would be required for the Army. I am convinced that if the Infantry soldier were kept at work like the Artil- lery-man or Cavalry soldier is, he would be much healthier. The ennui of a bar- rack-room is enough to make them ill. On hill stations the men could be worked with perfect safety, and in some stations in the plains. The late experience of making the prisoners in the military prison at Poona work has been attended with improvement in their health. If out of door work cannot be found, they might be employed in washing their clothes, in making coir matting, in carpentry, &c.; but work other than drill is necessary to employ their minds and give them an interest in their daily avoca- tions. There is not so much marching now in India as formerly, but soldiers are never so well in cantonments as they are on the line of march during the cold weather, and I think, as Government has recognized in cholera outbreaks the wisdom of leaving the affected barracks, that the same course might advantageously be adopted in outbreaks from other diseases, such as enteric or malarial fever. Medical or chemical skill may, in our present state of knowledge, not be able to discover the exact character of the poison which affects the men, but the practical action I am certain should be to clear out of the barracks when it becomes active. The good effects of leaving the fever-stricken Napier barracks at Karchi and of the march, even though it was through a somewhat malarial country, on the sickly 98th Regiment in 1881 were most remarkable. The men on leaving the station were so weakly that the ordinary marches had to be divided so that they might be able to perform them. Within six weeks they returned to Karchi so altered in appearance for the better, that it was difficult to believe that they were the same men. There is also another point I must mention.    We have the great authority of Dr. Aitken for saying that "no man can be considered as fit for work or for gene-
?169 ral military service for three or four months after an attack of severe enteric fever", and it must be remembered that the men admitted into hospital from this disease during the autumn have to contend with the vicissitudes of temperature which accompany the setting in of the cold weather. Many of them are subsequently invalided, and I think it is not improbable that some of the cases of phthisis may be referred to a previous attack of enteric fever. Any way I am quite sure that Government would save much expenditure incurred in sending invalids to Eng- land if advantage were taken of the health-restoring fresh air of the Arabian Sea. When the 98th Were suffering so severely at Karchi I suggested that the sickly men should be sent in the Indian Government sailing ship the Czarewitch to sea for a cruize of three weeks or so; my astonishment was great on learning that such an obvious course could not be carried out because the Finance authorities had ruled that any soldier who left the shore of India for more than three miles was at once struck off the strength of the Indian Army and that his pay ceased to be drawn from the Indian Exchequer. I would earnestly recommend Government to get this rule modified. It is necessarily broken every time a regiment is sent from Bombay to Karchi or Aden, or from Madras to Rangoon, &c.; but can anything be more discouraging than to be informed there is no possibility of utilizing the sea as a health resort? espe- cially as this scheme has the advantage which few recommendations that a Sanitary Officer makes, can possess, namely,-that it would entail on Government but very little expenditure. The men must be fed wherever they are, and the only expenditure I can see would be the cost in bringing them down to the port of embarkation. The Czarewitch is a troop-ship, and therefore requires no ex- pensive alterations. She is a sailing vessel and therefore there would be no expen- diture for coal. She is now occasionally sent to sea to teach the young officers of the service seamanship. It seems to me a thousand pities that she cannot be al- lowed to carry our sick soldiers for a cruize through the health-giving, because pure, air of the Indian Ocean. In Western India from our extended seaboard we have a great advantage, and convalescents might be sent from their stations to the nearest port where they could be picked up by the Czarewitch. I am quite sure lives would be saved and much invaliding prevented by the adoption of this course. I can only appeal to every one's experience as to the rapidity w ith which sick men pick up at sea. How often is one greeted on arrival in England with the laughing remark- " I dont believe you have been ill at all, you look so well now"; and the very know- ledge that they could get a change to sea would give the men hope, and that is worth anything, and will go a long way in helping to restore them to health. I trust I have sufficiently shown that local conditions, as found in stations in the Bombay Presidency, are quite enough in themselves to account for very much of the disease from which the British soldier suffers. No doubt climate, want of personal hygiene, young age, inferior physique, recent arrival, change of habits, insufficient diet, the spirit ration, &c., are most potential elements in pre- disposing the men to disease; but whilst local conditions, such as I have described, exist, I hold it far better and truer to speak out with no uncertain sound but to state exactly what my real opinion is and not to hide the significance which I believe attaches to them with reference to the production of disease; and I also consider I should fail in my duty if I did not point out to Government the mea- sures which have been proved by practical experience over and over again in other parts of the world to be the only ones on which reliance can be placed to eradicate disease causes. I am led to make these remarks because in my opinion the loss of efficiency and expense entailed by disease are not as fully recognized in this country as I think they should be, for it appears to me that disease in the army is sometimes thought to be a natural consequence of service in India and that it does not admit of practical remedy. The results given by the invaluable tables in the vital statistics of the European army in India for the 10 years, 1870-79, show, for example, that the aggregate strength of the Bombay Army during that period amounted to 103,587 men -selected lives it must be remembered-among whom no less than 158,848 admis- sions, or 1,533.5 per 1,000 of strength, took place. The average daily sick rate was 57.4 per 1,000 of strength, the average number of daily sick forthe 10 years
?170 being 5,946; 1,582 men, or 15.27 per 1,000 of strength, died, whilst 832 were inva- lided for discharge and 3,631 for change of climate; so that from death and inva- liding for discharge the army lost permanently 23.30 per 1,000 of strength and temporarily the services of 35.05 per 1,000 of its strength in addition. The death-rates of the different stations enumerated in the tables of the vital statistics show that in some of them the rates were enormously high. Why should the men die at such very high rates as 29.11 per 1,000 at Neemuch, 28.88 per 1,000 at Ahmedabad, or 23.73 per 1,000 at Nasirabad, whilst during the same period at Ahmednagar only 8.62 men per 1,000 died and at Belgaum only 7.76 per 1,000 ? There must be some reason for this. In the three stations first named the mean death-rate for the 10 years among the British troops there. quartered was higher than in the city of Bombay in 1874, when the death-rate only amounted to 23.43 per 1,000 and in the two first it is far higher and in the third not far short of the mean death-rate (26.31 per 1,000) of the city of Bombay during the 10 years, 1866-1875; and when it is remembered that the popula- tion of this crowded city consisted-not of selected lives as in the Army-but included infants, children, old men and women, the indigent and the inmates of the two large native hospitals-as well as adults, the above exceedingly high rates should, I respectfully submit, arrest attention, for surely such facts demand earnest enquiry and the removal of the causes which have led to such results. Again, if due consideration is given to the expenditure incurred in sending home the 4,463 invalids and in bringing other men out to replace them, as well as the 1,582 men who died, in addition to that representing the cost of maintenance of the hospi- tals, with their staff of medical Officers, subordinates, and menial servants, in which the 158,845 patients were treated, it must, I think, be conceded that there is nothing so expensive as disease, and that in the long run it would, leaving the question of efficiency on one side for the moment, be a truly economical policy to put our soldiers in India under the very best conditions to ensure health. The subject appears to me to derive increased importance from the acknow- ledged difficulty that is now felt in getting recruits for service in the British Army and to demand the earnest and careful consideration of all interested in the welfare of the Army. I cannot conclude this report without an acknowledgment of the assist- ance I have received from the Surgeon-General, Her Majesty's Forces, and especially from his late Secretary, Surgeon-Major Turnbull, as also from the Surgeon-General with the Government of Bombay and from the Officers in the Civil Department serving under him. My thanks are also due to the Deputy Surgeons-General in charge of the respective Divisions of the Army, as well as to the Officers commanding stations and corps and their staff. I am also particularly indebted to the Executive Medical Officers, Army Medical Department, to whom, I am aware, I occasioned a great deal of trouble, but who most kindly spared no pains to place at my disposal all the information in their power and who assisted me in every way they could.
