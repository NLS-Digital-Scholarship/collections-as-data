The sum total probably not excessive. This increase is shared by all the circles except Darjeeling, which shows a slight decrease. The particulars are as follows: increase, Calcutta and suburbs, 7,313 ; Metropolitan circles, 39,602; Ranchee, 893; Sonthal Pergunnahs, 3,968; Eastern Bengal circle, 30,942; and dispensary vaccinations, 30,152; total increase, 112,870 ; decrease, Darjeeling circle, 8,642; net increase, 104,228. This result is very satisfactory. The details of the operations of the different circles, with their results, are given in statement No. II. The returns of the vaccine circles are trustworthy, since they have been subjected to careful scrutiny by comparison with actual vaccinations by trustworthy officers. They amount to 573,170, or 72.3 per cent. of the whole. The dispensary vaccine returns are not so reliable as those of the circles, since much of this vaccination has not been inspected and verified as frequently and carefully as is desirable. The amount of check and supervision exercised over the work of dispensary vac- cinators and ex-inoculators varied in the different districts, as will be noticed in my remarks under that head. There is one feature in dispensary vaccination which I will now notice, viz. the percentage of successful cases. In season 1872-73 the percentage of successful cases in dispensary vaccination was 89.33, whereas in the year under report it is 79.12, showing that greater pains were taken in the way of check and supervision to ascertain the truth. In addition to the 493 ex-inoculators who worked and submitted their returns, there were others who were also engaged in vaccination, but who never sent in any return. The unrepresented work of these additional men would more than compensate any exaggeration or inaccuracy in the returns of dispensary vaccination, and the figures given in the above statement may be accepted as very near the truth. But even taking the total number of operations at 791,634, I find it falls far short of the requirements of the province. The population being 68 millions, the birth-rate, at 30 per 1,000, would be 2,040,000, whereas the total number of vaccinations is 791,634, or a little more than one-third. It is, however, satis- factory to find that in this respect some progress has been made during the past year, since in season 1872-73 the number of vaccinations did not reach quite one-third of the birth-rate.

The percentage of primary as compared with secondary cases among the coolies is owing to the fact that all coolies passing through the depôts are vaccinated, and that the great majority of them have been already protected before either by inoculation, natural small-pox, or vaccination.

As for the district of Jessore, the superintendent of the Metropolitan circles is prepared to under- take it with his existing establishment, and I have strongly recommended his proposal. Beerbhoom has not yet been provided for, and small-pox rages there every year : something ought to be done for that district. The civil surgeon will be asked to try and induce inoculators to change their practice, and to vaccinate in their old beats under check and supervision to be provided by Government. Dr. Charles's scheme is very sensible, but I cannot recommend its adoption in these times of financial pressure. If the self-supporting plans now under trial in Midnapore and Bankoora do not succeed, I will not hesitate to support his scheme on the advent of better times than the present. Superintendents. Metropolitan circles. 15. Dr. Charles brings to notice the zeal and industry of his superintendents. I have much pleasure in supporting his commendations of these hard-working servants of Government. The presidency vaccine establishment have done very good work, and the result is highly creditable to Dr. Charles and his superintendents. 16. The Metropolitan circles.REPORT. 7 Cost of each case. Vaccination becoming more popular. notwithstanding this increase, the average cost of each successful case was one anna and ten pie, against the same last year. This was due to the considerable increase in the number of oper- ations. Dr. Gupta and his deputy superintendents worked very hard during the season. They moved about constantly, and inspected the operations very frequently and closely. They saw 88 per cent. of the cases, which is highly creditable, and bespeaks much energy and zeal on their part. It is gratifying to observe that vaccination is becoming more and more popular every year. Many wealthy and high caste people, who had rejected the prophylactic before, yielded in the course of the last season. It is also satisfactory to find that incoulators are coming round and changing their practice, for if the whole country is to be ever thoroughly vaccinated, it must be done by the agency of ex-inoculators, and not by costly establishments maintained by the State. 21. A reference to the sketch map will show that of the five districts comprised in the Metropolitan circles, Nuddea has been once thoroughly protected, most of the 24-Pergunnahs and Hooghly have been gone over twice, and Burdwan has been almost done, except portions of sudder thana Burdwan, Kotulpore and Sonamukee, the two last being lately transferred from Bankoora.

This year he pointed out an area where the gang was to work, so that he might inspect them twice during the season. In spite of this the gang worked as far away as possible from the defined area, and the manager sent the returns to Dr. Lidderdale in the month of April, when the season was over, and when he could not possibly inspect and verify the cases. This marked inattention to instructions on the part of the manager seems to call for the notice of Government. 27. The total number of operations performed by the Darjeeling circle was 97,757, against 106,399 in 1872-73, showing a decrease of 8,642; and successful vaccinations 94,128, against 100,695REPORT. 9 31. I am sure Dr. Charles if asked will &quot;be glad to supply Dr. Lidderdale with a number of copies of his Bengali pamphlet on vaccination, and also give him permission to translate the other brochure on popular information regarding small-pox, inoculation, and vaccination into Nepalese. Lymph supply. 32. The Darjeeling hills as a source of lymph supply.10 REPORT. in Lohardugga The number of deaths from small-pox in the circle during the past year was 667, of which 338 were reported from Hazareebagh, 201 from Lohardugga, 95 from Manbhoom, and 33 from Singbhoom. The mortality was much larger this year than in the previous one, and the disease prevailed to a greater extent. Ex-inoculators. 38. Vaccination by the agency of ex-inoculators in the Chota Nagpore division has now become an institution, more especially in the districts of Manbhoom and Singbhoom, as will be seen from the abstract reports of the civil surgeons of those districts. Dr. Wood has given in his report a summary of the proceedings of the ex-inoculators in his circle. In Manbhoom six Hindustani vaccinators and 23 ex-inoculators worked in 295 villages, and vaccinated 15,150 cases, of which Mr. Wilson, the civil surgeon, verified 12,213. Out of the number verified, 9,775, or 87.85 per cent., were successful. In Singbhoom 24 ex-inoculators were engaged in vaccination, and worked in 291 villages. The number operated was 17,777, of which 16,722 are said to have been successful and 455 unsuccessful, though Mr. Manook inspected only 541 cases. Thirty converted inoculators worked in Hazareebagh and vaccinated 10,132 persons, of whom 9,320, or 93.21 per cent., are said to have been successful, and 37 men vaccinated 26,804 persons in the district of Lohardugga, and 14,021, or 97.90, successfully. No check* or supervision was exercised over the operations of these men, and the figures are not very reliable. Three Christian Coles learnt vaccination and operated on 2,307 persons. Five others also worked, but submitted no return. A great many apprentices, exact number not given, were attached to the circle. Though they received no allowance, they worked remarkably well, as they had the prospect of being appointed as vaccinators whenever vacancies occurred. The native superintendents are reported to have taken more pains and trouble for them than for the establishment. They vaccinated 17,922 persons, of whom 17,667, or 99.53, were successful. I concur with Dr. &quot;Wood's remark that these apprentices should receive some subsistence allowance. Eastern Bengal circle. 39. Eastern Bengal circle, establishment.REPORT. 11 rendered great assistance and facilitated the work. They seem to deserve honorable mention, as suggested by the superintendent. Inspection. Establishment. 42. Baboo Bhoobun Mohun Mitter was on inspection tour from 15th October to 24th May, and visited each gang four or six times. He verified upwards of 21,000 cases, comparing the names with the registers, and inspected village after village in a systematic plan. He has submitted a table of his inspection, which makes the percentage of success to be 99.11, while in the general return it is 99.44. The superintendent again advocates the extension of Act IV (B. C.) of 1865 to the Dacca district. As the number of successful vaccinations is already more than double the birth-rate of the district, even with an incomplete establishment, I am decidedly of opinion, as before stated, that the provisions of the Act may be safely extended to Dacca. The measure would give an impulse to vaccination in Eastern Bengal. Baboo Bhoobun Mohun Mitter reports favourably of his establishment, and mentions the name of head vaccinator Judoo Nath Chowdry as deserving of especial commendation. The superin- tendent has worked very hard, and performed his duties with great zeal and judgment, which entitles him to the favourable notice of Government. 43. The Sonthal Pergunnahs.12 REPORT. great credit for having induced a greater number of inoculators to engage in vaccination. They vaccinated a large number, but the quality of the vaccination could not have been unexceptionable, as some of the vaccinated persons are reported to have had small-pox within a period varying from three months to one year. In Beerbhoom the work performed by the Government vaccinator was rather small. In Midnapore the work has fallen off, and Dr. Mathews could not exercise any supervision over the ex-inoculators. The withholding of the retaining fee at the instance of the magistrate was, in my opinion, most unfortunate. The men could not be expected to work so well for nothing as they did when they received some allowance. As, however, it has been taken away, it may not be thought advisable to give it back. It is a doubtful point, which perhaps His Honor the Lieutenant- Governor may himself decide. As the time of the civil surgeon is much taken up with the extra work on account of the prevalence of fever in this district, I would recommend the appointment of one or two vaccine inspectors. The work of the municipal vaccinators of Hooghly, Howrah, and Serampore was considerable in amount and good in quality. Several municipalities in the 24-Pergunnahs and Nuddea applied for and obtained vaccinators from the staff of the Metropolitan circles. The work was supervised by the local medical officers, and also by the officers of the vaccine establishment, and it was found to be good. Jessore has made much progress under Dr. Hutcheson, who employed a larger number of vaccinators and of converted inoculators to carry on vaccination. Great improvement is visible in the district of Moorshedabad, where the amount of work underwent considerable increase. No vaccin- ation was performed in Dinagepore, and a trifling amount in Malda. Rajshahye exhibits considerable improvement. There should be vaccinators attached to the Rajshahye sudder dispensary. Dr. Ghose introduced dispensary vaccination in Rungpore last year with great success, for which he deserves credit. The work in Bogra by municipal vaccinators has increased, but the converted inoculators either did not vaccinate at all, or, if they did, they have furnished no returns. Vaccination in Pubna was a miserable failure from bad lymph; it was somewhat better in the Serajgunge sub-division. The Orissa districts show somewhat better results than before. The amount of vaccination performed in the town of Dacca under Dr. Wise's supervision was pretty considerable, with more than average success. In Fureedpore the work was good in quantity, and considerably in excess of that done in 1872-73. Dr. Bensley has succeeded in getting a larger number of vaccinations done in Backergunge, but the ratio of success was not very high. In Mymensingh vaccin- ation was much impeded by the frequent failure of lymph-supply, and the amount is consequently less than in the previous year. In Sylhet, on the other hand, the work was more than double of that in 1872-73. Dr. Monteath succeeded in getting some good work done in Cachar. Chittagong shows better results, for which Dr. Meadows deserves credit. Vaccination is gaining ground in the district, and the people are beginning to appreciate its benefits. The work performed in Noakholly was considerably in excess of that in 1872-73. A few inoculators were converted by Mr. Dutt. Tipperah shows better results this year. The province of Assam has made considerable progress in vaccination, which is shared more or less by every district. At the request of the commissioner the Government sanctioned the appointment of one inspector and two vaccinators for Gowhatty. In addition to these, Dr. Russell, the civil surgeon, instructed 55 inoculators, who carried on vaccination in the district, and protected large numbers of the people. The employment of extra vaccinators for the season was also sanctioned for other districts. The total number of vaccinations performed in Eastern Bengal and Assam during the past year is more than double of that in 1872-73. In Patna the amount of work was considerable, and carefully supervised by Dr Smith and his assistants. In the year 1872-73 the Dinapore vaccinator had done shame- fully little work; and in 1873-74 he did only 28 cases more than in the preceding season, with less than average success. Dr. R Macleod has fully maintained the progress made in Gya in the preceding years. In the Arrah district vaccination was performed assiduously in all the dispensaries. Dr. Harvey of Buxar deserves great credit for pushing on the work of vaccination by the agency of 51 converted inoculators. Notwithstanding the famine, the number of vaccinations in Tirhoot was pretty numerous, and performed at several centres. In the Sarun district a new centre has been formed in Hutwa, and the total number of operations has increased. In Chumparun, on the other hand, the work has fallen off on account of the famine ; Dr. Cullen, however, deserves credit for having induced many inoculators to change their practice. In Monghyr a large number of vaccinations was performed by the agency of converted inoculators, whose number increased considerably during the year. I quite agree with Dr Purves that the Government grant for vaccination should be increased for the sake of giving encouragement to the men. The work has fallen off in Bhagulpore, owing probably to the famine, and also, it is said, to the absence of small-pox. Many who will not accept vaccination when no small-pox is present willingly receive it when that disease appears. Dr. Baillie inspected some of the work only, as his time was occupied by famine matters. More supervision over the work of the converted inoculators is necessary in Monghyr and Bhagulpore. Vaccination is still very backward in Purneah, though it is a good sign that 35 inoculators changed their practice during the year. In Julpigoree a few vaccinations were performed by the dispensary establishments. No return was received from Darjeeling. Vaccination in the
REPORT. 13 Chota Nagpore division has been already described. The amount of inspection accomplished by Mr. Manook in Manbhoom contrasts favourably with the trifling number in Singbhoom, and the total absence of it in Lohardugga and Hazareebagh. Small-pox. 50. The year 1873-74 was remarkable for the great prevalence of small-pox. The disease was not absent from any district, while it assumed an epidemic form in several localities. In Calcutta small-pox was present all the year, and caused a total reported, mortality of 67. There was very little small-pox within the Metropolitan circles. In Bankoora and Beerbhoom the disease prevailed severely, and caused a large mortality. Small-pox was more or less severe in Jessore, Moorshedabad, Cuttack, Pooree, Noakholly, Goalpara, Nowgong, Arrah, Sarun, Chumparun, Monghyr, Hazareebagh, Sonthal Pergunnahs, and other districts. There is no doubt that 1873-74 was a year of small-pox. The usual cause which lights up small-pox is always present in Bengal, namely the baneful practice of inoculation without any rule or restriction. But this alone could not account for the unusual prevalence of small-pox during the last year. There must have been other causes at work. What those causes are, have not yet been ascertained. Some atmospheric conditions are believed to exercise much influence over small-pox. Atmospheric changes are above human control, but we should endeavour to reduce to a minimum the chances of small-pox spreading. This can be effected by thorough and systematic vaccination, and by putting a stop to the baneful practice of inoculation. Dr. Charles has brought out fully the benefits which thorough and systematic vaccination confers on a community. Though case after case of small-pox was imported into the city, the spark was soon extinguished. I am indebted to Surgeon-Major J. M. Coates, M.D., Officiating Sanitary Commissioner for Bengal, for the Table No. VII appended to this report, showing the number of deaths from small-pox reported monthly from each district in Bengal during the past year 1873-74.

The increase among the permanent residents, as divided between the town and suburbs, consisted in 194 for the town and 477 in the suburbs. The actual numbers vaccinated in the town amounted to 5,182 after deducting the cases in which the result was not known and cases of re-vaccination. The corresponding figures for the previous year were 5,011. In the part of Calcutta lying under the jurisdiction of the suburban municipality, 8,195 persons were vaccinated for the first time as compared to 7,728 during the previous twelve months.

The rest of the neighbourhood has been thoroughly vaccinated, and there has not been a single case of small-pox near it. In the one house small-pox broke out in the last week in February, and in the other one a month later. At the first point it ran through eight children, ranging up to 14 years of age, in the other five children, the eldest of whom was nearly eighteen. In the first house a marked instance of how vaccin- ation protects was brought very closely home to those whose family was being ravaged by the disease. The only child that escaped was one which had been caught last year and vaccinated. This local outbreak was simply allowed to burn itself out, and we had full confidence in the absolute safety which years of hard work had secured to those around. Sequelæ of small-pox. 7.

Before he had time to carry his designs further into execution he was tried before a magistrate and sentenced to the full penalty of confinement with hard labour for three calendar months. Before moving for a prosecution I satisfied myself that this man was not a professional inoculator, and that he had not been driven into breaking the law by the loss of his hereditary occupation. The man's name was Oodeen Bahalia, and sufficiently points him out as deserving of no sympathy while inoculating in Calcutta, even had the investigation not shown that he was deserving of special punishment. Defects in the Act prohibiting inoculation. It is most unlikely that recourse will have to be made sufficiently often to this law in Calcutta to render it advisable to have the Act amended; but in case any emergency may arise in other districts, it may perhaps not be out of place for me to put on record that the Act, as it at present stands, is not an easy one to work. While conducting the prosecution with the law officers of Government it appeared20 CALCUTTA AND THE SUBURBS. It is impossible for me to express in a more vivid form the mistake it would be to leave such small unprotected localities for small-pox to keep itself up unchecked by vaccination, and month by month be carried into Calcutta and into the surrounding districts for which vaccine establishments have been provided. Small-pox thus spread about costs the Govern- ment heavy sums to stamp out; and not only so but, as frequently pointed out before, a vaccinated tract of country only receives relative, and not absolute, immunity from small- pox, and each vaccinated person who takes the disease after having been vaccinated naturally shakes the confidence of the community among whom it occurs in the efficacy of the prophylactic. A few years hence all of those included within the vaccine circles will have had sufficient reason afforded to them to believe in the value of the protection they receive, and any stray instances of small-pox after the protection afforded by vaccination will produce little effect on their minds. After they have been witness to the comparative immunity from small- pox of a well vaccinated population, they will listen to reason and appreciate at their true worth any cases in which vaccination falls short of what they expected. For the present, while vaccination is on its trial among ignorant millions, I conceive it to be the duty of all to arrange as far as possible that its shortcomings shall be kept out of sight. One point of importance to secure this end is so to arrange that no unprotected spots remain in the centre of vaccine circles. For the above reasons, as well as for the protection of Calcutta, I beg to urge that nothing should be allowed to stand in the way of providing vaccination for the four districts which stand out conspicuously for their want of vaccination, while being surrounded on every side by other districts which hem them in by a population for which vaccination has been provided. Memorandum by H. B. BUCKLE, ESQ., Deputy Surgeon-General, Presidency Circle, (No. 10, dated Fort William, the 17th June 1874.) FORWARDS the annual returns and report of the Presidency Vaccination Department for the year 1873-74, submitted by the Superintendent-General of Vaccination. The working of the establishment and the practical results demonstrated by the small number of cases of small-pox treated, and of deaths from that disease in the populous city of Calcutta and its suburbs, and which can only be ascribed to the thorough manner in which protection by means of vaccination has been given, is most satisfactory. This office memorandum No. 9L, dated 3rd June Bengal Vaccination Report for 1872-73. With reference to Dr. Charles's proposal for extending the area of vaccination round Calcutta, he recommends that Midnapore should be included in the vaccinating circles. At present a scheme of vaccinating by the local inoculators who have been instructed in vaccination is under trial; the magistrate and the civil surgeon are very sanguine of success.In forwarding the vaccine report of the Superintendent of Vaccination, Metropolitan circle, attention was requested to Dr. Mathew's report for the year 1872-73, and it is suggested that further inquiry should be made as to how the system has answered this yearbefore putting a stop to it and introducting another. A great point would be gained if it were possible to encourage and develop a local scheme of vaccination in a district rather than the more forced one of vaccination by a special agency. The real difference is in the thorough supervision and inspection of the work that is provided for in the latter; but surely it would be possible to provide for this in a system like that in practice in the Midnapore district.

Another gang under head vaccinator Troylukho Nath Chuckerbutty commenced oper- ations in sudder thana Burdwan, but they were soon laid up with fever and became almost useless. The men became so much dispirited that it was cruel and useless to keep them there any longer, so I ordered their removal to Khundghose and Roynah, as about a third part of the former and a fifth of the latter thana had remained over from last year. The health of the vaccinators improved by the change, and they were able to do some work. They vaccin- ated nearly all the unprotected villages, and were about to undertake some other thana when they were ordered to proceed to Beerbhoom to stamp out small-pox which had been raging there for some time. They visited 77 villages situated in four thanas, and vaccinated 9,211 persons in the Beerbhoom district, notwithstanding all opposition from the people, and without any assistance whatever from the district authorities. A third gang, under head vaccinator Woomesh Chunder Mookerjee, vaccinated in thanas Culna, Gangoor, and a portion of Montessur. In the first-named thana there were several khas villages, i.e. villages devoted to the worship of Shitollah, the goddess of small-pox, and opposed to both vaccination and inoculation. Woomesh Chunder's gang deserve much credit for having succeeded in vaccinating nearly all of them, though there still remain some houses and families that have not yet accepted vaccination. A fourth gang, under head vaccinator Tarruck Chunder Chatterjee, commenced in thana Selimabad, where they suffered dreadfully from fever; their peon died, and one or two vaccin- ators deserted through fear. These and other untoward circumstances interfered with the thorough vaccination of the thana , for which I had to make arrangements with the 2nd circle. From Selimabad the gang proceeded to thana Jehanabad, where they vaccinated nearly all the unprotected villages in its southern portion. A few still remain to be done. They also vaccinated some villages in the adjoining thana of Khanacool. A fifth gang, under first class vaccinator Ram Chunder Nusker, got thana Bullaghur, in Hooghly, which they completely vaccinated in three months. To provide fresh work for this gang I communicated with the Magistrate of 24-Pergunnahs, and eventually sent them to thana Diamond Harbour. Meantime the gang crossed the river Hooghly and vaccinated some villages in thanas Chogdah and Ranaghat, in the Nuddea district. A sixth gang, under first class vaccinator Koylash Chunder Mitter, took thanas Oolaberiah and Shampore, in the Howrah district. Area of 3rd circle. The area of the country undertaken by the 3rd circle is 1,333 square miles, and popu- lation 862,038. The vaccinators visited 1,844 villages and vaccinated 168,118 persons, of whom the deputy superintendent inspected 119,366, or 71.0 per cent. Degree of protection afforded by 3rd circle.

In the first week of January I again proceeded to Coomercolly, as my first visit to that thana had been very short and hurried. After returning to Calcutta I went down again to thanas Oolaberiah and Shampore, and inspected the vaccine operations there; came back and started on a long tour, beginning with thana Culna, passed on to thana Selimabad. Leaving Selimabad I proceeded to thanas Dhunniakhally and Hurripaul, in the Hooghly district; crossed the Damoodur, and went over to the southern portion of thana Jehanabad, in the Burdwan district. From thana Jehanabad came back to Hurripal, and thence to Buddybatee and Chunditollah. After resting for two or three days, started again for the Burdwan district. This time I inspected in thanas Gangoor and Montessur. From Montessur I returned to Calcutta at the end of March, when the season expired. I regret I had no time left to go to the extreme north and east of the 24-Pergunnahs, but Deputy Superintendent Ramsoonder Ghose has thoroughly inspected all the thanas in that portion of the district. With the exception of the gang deputed to Beerbhoom, I visited every gang twice, and some three times, during the season. The Beerbhoom gang was inspected by Deputy Superintendent Jadub Chunder Ghose. Number inspected by superintendent. The number inspected by me during the season is 47,165, against 51,368 in the previous season, showing a decrease of 4,203. There are several causes for this falling off, the first and principal being that the three circles were scattered in three. districts, whereas in the previous season the first and second circles worked near each other in Nuddea. Then, again, in season 1872-73 the first two circles got virgin soil, as it were, where vaccination had never been done before, and consequently the numbers vaccinated, as well as inspected, were larger. I lost much time in travelling from one circle to another, as the details given above will show. I inspected 614 villages, situated in twenty-five different thanas, exclusive of the Dacca circle. The result of my inspection is shown in the following table:METROPOLITAN CIRCLES. 27 In places which were vaccinated for the first time, there was a good deal of opposition at first, such as Jonye and its surrounding villages in thana Chunditollah, the khas villages in thana Culna and thana Montessur in the Burdwan district. In Jonye the vaccinators succeeded after three months; and in Montessur the Brahmin vaccinators worked on the prejudices of the sudra zemindar by laying huttya, and thereby bringing Baboo Parbuttychurn Roy round, to whom all the neighbouring villages looked up.

Instruction of inoculators With reference to Mr. Gupta's remarks on the instruction of inoculators, the same necessity as in all vaccination operations for a really efficient supervising and controlling agency exists. The protective influence of vaccination depending so completely on the care with which the operation is performed and the selection of proper lymph, cannot be left to be carried out by any agency except it is under thorough control, and the work inspected by competent and trustworthy officers. If this can be arranged, a system similar to that in practice in the Midnapore district might probably answer. There the vaccinators are ex-inoculators, and receive a purwanah from the magistrate granting them permission to vaccinate in the villages named on the document. The privilege is jealously guarded; all outsiders, both inoculators and vaccinators, are warned off as interlopers, the men holding the purwanahs looking to remunerate themselves by fees. In the first instance these men received a retaining fee of a few rupees monthly from Government; during the last year this has not been given, and the magistrate doubts if there is any necessity for continuing it. The supervising and controlling agency rests with the civil surgeon, and depends very much on the time he can personally devote to the duty, visiting and testing the work of the vaccinators in the district, and the trustworthi- ness of the more educated vaccinators he entertains for the purpose of inspecting the work of the men at the different villages. It seems possible that some system of the kind indicated might be developed, while to vaccinate the population of a country by establishments maintained for that purpose appears, after the first opposition to the measure has been overcome, likely to limit the extent to which vaccination ought to be carried out, and to prevent its becoming at any period either self-supporting or generally accepted by the community at large.

Eighth Annual Report of the Darjeeling Circle of Vaccination, by SURGEON-MAJOR R. LIDDERDALE, M.D., Superintendent. Establishment. 2. Establishment.32 DARJEELING CIRCLE. Opposition among Nepalese. however ceased to exist, as it was found that in November and December he was absent on the plea of vaccinating, while really attending to building contracts on tea gardens, and his services were dispensed with. I have now succeeded in getting two Brahmins, keeping only- one Lepcha; and although the work has improved in quality, the Bengalis are very ill-suited physically for mountain work and the exposure incidental to it. They profess also to live in great terror of the hill people, and cannot believe that when passing through forests they must not necessarily encounter tigers. I intend to give them a fair trial, and if possible raise the standard of vaccination, which has always been low in these hills, partly from the dress and habits of the people, and partly from carelessness in the performance of the operation and in the selection of lymph. There has been a good deal of opposition to vaccination lately among the Nepalese, and in one or two instances among the Bhooteahs. Some Nepalese had no hesitation in stating that they intended to send for an inoculator at their own convenience and be inoculated. Opposition from this class arises, too, in another way; those who work in gangs on tea gardens are under sirdars, who object to having their coolies vaccin- ated, as the coolies like to have two or three days' leave when suffering from the vaccine fever, and the sirdars lose allowances (sirdari) when they are absent. I have tried to get native doctors in charge of tea gardens to operate during December and January, when labour is light, but one of them confessed to me that last cold weather he had protected one person, while a Government vaccinator succeeded in vaccinating about 80 on a neighbouring garden, where no cooly had ever been vaccinated before. The absence of small-pox from these hills for so longDARJEELING CIRCLE. 33 him, and from the determined opposition arising to vaccination from the proceedings of a gang of vaccinators kept by the rajbari, and by other ex-inoculators working on their own account. Vaccination not being a novelty in this district, it was my wish to introduce the arm-to-arm system; but I believe the opposition of the vaccinators to it was equal to that of the people. It requires constant and daily attention to duty, whereas lymph dried on ivory slips can be carried about and applied at the convenience of the vaccinator. As the native superintendent, though in every way qualified for his duty as far as knowledge was concerned, was found quite untrustworthy, the deputy superintendent was detailed in December to look after the district, and only from his exertions was anything accomplished. His services, which were often urgently required in other districts, were thus lost to me. He pushed on arm-to- arm vaccination as much as possible. One vaccinator tried to excite mutiny in the gang against it, so much so that out of one native superintendent and six vaccinators in November I was obliged to discharge all but one vaccinator before the end of March. The Rajbari gang In the western portion of Rajarampore, which is the thana all round the town of Dinagepore, I found that ex-inoculators had been working last year with this result, that the people generally stated to me that &quot;vaccination was a very bad thing, attended with severe fever and followed by sores lasting five, six, and seven months, incapacitating the sufferers for all agricultural labour.&quot; This story had been told in every village and at every hât in the neighbourhood, and was the first salutation given to a vaccinator when he arrived at a village. This has followed by permitting vaccination to be carried on by imperfectly instructed men independent of all supervision, as I have had occasion to point out in other reports. It is now necessary, if vaccination is not to come to a standstill in this district, that no ex-inoculator who will not submit to supervision be permitted to practise, and that the proceedings of the rajbari gang be at once put a stop to. It is my painful duty to bring this matter forward again. It was my belief that the manager of the Dinagepore Ranee's estates was acting in good faith in getting together a number of vaccinators, and failure followed their misconduct. Since last season I have again had to correspond with the magistrate of the district on the subject, and I thought that it had been made sufficiently plain to Baboo Khetro Mohun Sing the necessity of supervision over his gang. I pointed out an area in which it might work, where I could have conducted an inspection twice during last season. I was, therefore, astonished to find that after all the correspondence and trouble I had taken to put the gang on a useful footing, that the manager sent me the returns for all the season in April when he must have known that my inspection for the season was over, and his vaccinators were reported as having worked in several jurisdictions as far removed as possible from the one desired by me. I beg, therefore, that this man's conduct be brought especially to the notice of the Government, and that he be no longer permitted to show such grave disrespect to a public servant as he has shown to me. The conduct of his gang of vaccinators has been attended by serious abuses, which should authoritatively be put a stop to at once. From a petition made to me by one of them, I am induced to believe that the rajbari has never given a rupee to one of its vaccinators. As long as such a state of matters is allowed to continue, it is idle to expect the Government men, restricted as to pay and prevented taking any money from the people, to perform their duty in a satisfactory manner. The rajbari gang returned 6,403 successful cases out of 6,926, which, excluding those unknown, gives a percentage of success of 92.99, which I have no doubt is absurdly untrue. Amount of protection afforded. The whole of the Rajarampore thana, west of the Atrai river, has now been gone over by the Government men. Two hundred and twenty-three villages were protected during the season by them. Rungpore district. Protection afforded 7. Rungpore.34 DARJEELING CIRCLE. Bogra district. 8.

I found a large tract of country to the north of Rampore Beauleah, in which the inoculators on their arrival had always been put off till a more convenient season, which certainly had not come about in five and twenty or thirty years, old, grey-headed people, and the majority of the adults, requiring protection. Population , vaccine staff The population of Rajshahye is 1,310,729. The Government establishment consists of one native superintendent and five vaccinators. The native superintendent desires one additional vaccinator to be added to his gang to make it equal in number to those of the other five districts. It is most advisable that this should be done. The municipality of Rampore Beauleah and that of Nattore supported one vaccinator each. Their returns will be submitted by the civil surgeon. I took occasion, when at Nattore, to see some of the vaccinators' work, and being dissatisfied with it reported the matter to the deputy magistrate, who in reply informed me that shortly after my visit the vaccinator had been sentenced to four months' rigorous imprisonment for &quot; lurking house-trespass by night.&quot; This is most unfortunate, and it will retard vaccination in Nattore, that the vaccinator should be looked upon as a person who may bring the information about families which he gets when doing his work into use for carrying on intrigues Maldah district. 10. Maldah.36 DARJEELING CIRCLE. Ex-inoculators work. Fifteen ex-inoculators also submitted returns of 4,062 operations, with a percentage of success of 95.61, which however is unreliable. Many ex-inoculators I know were at work, but sent in no returns, some from inability to write them. Out of the returns I got a few more taken down by word of mouth, with all details of caste, sex, and age of course wanting. To the above sums may be added 6,926 operations by the Dinagepore rajbari vaccin- ators, making a grand total for the Darjeeling circle of 114,499, less than half the birth-rate.

The percentage of success according to the above inspection table is 98.06, giving a difference of 2.34. As the inspection of the largest numbers takes place in those districts, such as Rajshahye and Bogra, where the work is of the highest quality, a slightly better result is brought out than really obtains for the whole circle. The deputy superintendent being chiefly employed in looking after the vaccination of Dinagepore during the seasons, did not verify returns to such an extent as otherwise would have been the case. He was active and attentive to his duty. Distribution of vaccinators. 13. Distribution of vaccinators.38 DARJEELING CIRCLE. vaccination, but they have spread reports that all vaccinated persons die, so that the villagers who have been told this are prepared to resist it by violence. This attitude of the people, however, is by no means general. Fifteen inoculators of Julpigoree, Purneah, and Maldah, were brought on the establishment as apprentices and instructed as vaccinators. They all belong to the weaver class, of whom a large number live in the north of Purneah, spreading themselves all over northern Bengal when pursuing their calling. Ex-inoculators. The magistrate of Purneah granted purwanahs to thirty-five inoculators to practise vaccination, but of the proceedings of most of them nothing is known. Mr Picachy mentions in his report, which he has been good enough to communicate to me, that one man sent in a return of what he had done. These men resorted to the magistrate of the district, as they knew they would not get certificates of proficiency from me until I was satisfied they knew their work, and would insist on inspecting it and taking returns. I have had correspondence with Mr, Kemble on this subject, and he seems desirous of giving me every assistance, so that these men may be made efficient vaccinators. With such a number, each one performing 1,500 operations, the birth-rate of Purneah would yearly be exceeded. Inspector of inoculators required. The want of an inspector of inoculators was severely felt during the season, as no one would, at the rate of pay granted, undertake the work, which is one of constant travelling and exposure for half the year. If three suitable men are obtainable at the Presidency, I trust they may be ordered up in September, or at latest October, as I see no present prospect of getting men in my circle. The pay granted for a man who has for so many months to pay for food and lodging: every night away from his home is too small to attract trustworthy men. Apprentices. The plan of paying 42 apprentices while under instruction is a most admirable measure, from which I have the highest hopes as soon as it is brought into full working. The order reached me too late last year to enable me to get the full number, or to pick out the best men. I had to take almost any one who came forward. Native superintendents will be instructed during the recess season to look out for promising men. Darjeeling hills as a lymph depôt for Bengal. 16. Darjeeling hills as a source of lymph supply for Bengal.DINAPORE CIRCLE. 39 (e) The staff of vaccinators in Darjeeling is three. It mustbe greatly larger in Kumaon and Gurhwal, as I find that in one season they filled 2,951 tubes, and collected 16,132 crusts, while each vaccinator in 1871-72 vaccinated only 195 persons, having an area of 884 square miles, with a population of 48,810 in which to carry on his operations. (f) There is no really good class available from which to choose vaccinators in Darjeeling, while the supply in Kumaon and Gurhwal must be ample. The collections in the Darjeeling hills are therefore the work of the superintendent's hand alone. From the foregoing it must not be supposed that no lymph can be issued from Darjee- ling, or that it is useless as a source of supply. My wish is to explain the matter so that too great reliance may not be placed upon it, and disappointment result. I think it would be sufficient to expect the Darjeeling hills to supply at the beginning of every season a good stock for all the men in the Darjeeling vaccine establishment in the plains, who are so much scattered as to require much more than if they were concentrated in one zillah, and to all the civil stations and dispensaries north of the Granges and west of the Brahmapootra, in Bengal. Storing of surplus lymph in Darjeeling. As it has been found that lymph collected one cold season in the plains and kept in the hills during the hot months retains its vitality and is fit for issue in the following October, I proposed in my letter No. 183 of 13th September last, to the Deputy Surgeon-General, Pinafore, that surplus stocks of lymph remaining in Calcutta in March should be sent to me here for care during the hot season. As none have reached me, the proposition does not seem to have met with approval; but I still think that the Superintendents of the Metro- politan, Dacca, and Sonthal Pergunnah circles should forward here their surplus stocks of lymph collected each season, not later than the 16th March, to avoid exposure to great heat. The Government would then know whence a large supply of reliable lymph could be got at once in case of small-pox anywhere appearing epidemically. 17.

THE usual establishment of three head vaccinators and 20 vaccinators was employed The work of the establishment is represented by 37,411 cases and 35,177 successful cases, or 97.491 per cent., and the cost of each successful case was five annas very nearly.

There is thus an increase of 893 cases and a decrease of 29 successful cases. The percentage of success is slightly lower, but the cost of each successful case is a little less.The smaller percentage of success compared with last year is accounted for by the comparatively large number (1,578), and necessarily small success (76.71), in the non-working season of 1873-74, which reduced the working season's figure of percentage from 97.81 to the total percentage of 97.49. In 1872-73 only 525 cases were done, with 74.63 per cent. success- ful in the non-working months, and the figures for the working season were less affected. Non-working season. 3.

The apprentices have great inducement to exert themselves in order to obtain vaccinatorships. The result of their labours is 17,922 cases, of which 17,667, or 99.53 per cent., were successful. It is to be regretted that a small subsistence allowance has not yet been granted to these and other learners; and more particularly that afterwards no proper inspection of their work in general is possible.

EASTERN BENGAL CIRCLE. 45 The following is a good illustration. A certain number of people who had turned deaf to the words of vaccinators and refused to get their children vaccinated, adopted it when Babu Poornoo Chunder Ghose, deputy magistrate, in charge of Manikgunge sub-division, pointed out to them the beneficial effects of vaccination and the dangers of inoculated small- pox, and showed them the arms of his own children. The cause of vaccination would have been ruined had he acted otherwise.

The Seventh Annual Report on vaccination in the Sonthal Pergunnahs, by Assistant Surgeon KALI KRISHNA GHOSE, Deputy Superintendent. Establishment. 1. THE establishment continued the same as last year, i.e. one deputy superintendent and six vaccinators. The latter were arranged in grades: thus one vaccinator in the first grade on a salary of Rs. 16 per month, employed rate, and Rs. 12, unemployed rate; two in the second grade on Rs. 13 and Rs. 10 respectively; and three in the third grade, on Rs. 10 and Rs. 8 each. There were no changes among these. Non-working season. 2. The non-working season.50 SONTHAL PERGUNNAHS. It is impelled, as it were, by a sort of religious fear not to remain unprotected in the midst of neighbouring protected villages, with whom it must have frequent intercourse. 6. The greater portion of pergunnah Ambar and the northern portion of pergunnah Sultanabad, constituting the zemindaree portions of the sub-division of Pakour, have been protected by vaccination last year. The area, as may be seen from the accompanying sketch map, extends westward to within a few miles of the boundary line between Pakour and Doomka; southward to within a few miles of Moheshpore, the residence of Rajah Gopal Singh Bahadoor, zemindar of Sultanabad; and eastward to near the railway line, and in certain places even across that line to the east. Owing to the ruggedness of the tract, the exact area in square miles cannot be determined. Number of villages protected. In this area 163 villages have been protected, and a total number of 10,091 primary and two secondary vaccinations performed; 9,804 primary vaccinations were successful. The percentage of success was therefore 97.20, excluding the cases unknown from total. The two cases of re-vaccination were successful. The population of Pakour sub-division, according to the last census, amounts to 141,304 ; now, taking the annual birth-rate at 30 per 1,000, we have 4,239.12 children annually born, so that more than double this number has been protected. The village of Pakour itself, in which stands the residence of the zemindar of Ambar, has been left unprotected. The reason is that for two successive seasons past I have been foiled in my attempts to get vaccination introduced into the zemindar's family and village. This year I did not at first think of renewing my attempt, because I was afraid that would weaken the cause of vaccination in their zemindaree. These rich men have a great influence for good as well as for evil. If we succeed with them, the good that is done to the cause of vaccination is immeasurable; but if we fail, the mischief that is done is quite as great, if not greater. People are very apt to follow their example So instead of disturbing them at first and throwing them into open resistance, I had this year adopted the policy of quietly establishing vaccination in their zemindaree and almost all round their village, in the hope of getting them round by degrees. Subsequently, when vaccination had been established in the surrounding locality, I had attempted to influence them, through the head- master of their school whose children got vaccinated, but without success. By the exercise of tact and judgment, however, we have succeeded in accomplishing the object of establish- ing vaccination in their zemindaree without their aid, as much as we could have done with it. The present year, however, opens with an auspicious circumstance. Rajah Gopal Singh Bahadoor, zemindar of Sultanabad, has allowed his household and his village to be thoroughly vaccinated, and has thus paved the way for the future progress of vaccination in his zemindaree. Rajmehal. 7. In the sub-division of Rajmehal two vaccinators, viz. Peary Mohun Doss and Bhagiruth Doss, were placed with instructions to protect certain definite areas in the interior. They were carrying on their work with vigour in the tract of land lying six or seven miles to the west of Bahawa station, East Indian Railway, when outbreaks of small- pox occurring in the sub-division itself, and subsequently in the sub-division of Godda, interfered with the regular progress of their work. Vaccinator Peary Mohun Doss had to be sent to Godda in the beginning of January, for the purpose of suppressing the fearful epidemic of small-pox that broke out there, and of giving instruction, if possible, to the inoculators who were at work in the sub-division; and vaccinator Bhagiruth Doss also followed him towards the latter end of February. Number of villages protected and operations performed In the sub-division of Rajmehal 38 villages have been protected last year, and a total number of 3,296 primary and 53 secondary vaccinations performed. 3,071, or 93.17 per cent., of the former, and 45, or 84.90 per cent., of the latter were successful. The population of Rajmehal being 190,890, the annual birth-rate is 5,726.7, less than two-thirds of which were protected last year, chiefly by two vaccinators working during a portion of the season. There was, however, another agency at work in this sub-divisionSONTHAL PERGUNNAHS. 51 Results. Of the total 15,039 cases, 14,984 were primary vaccinations, of which 14,409, or 96.19 per cent., were successful, and 55 were re-vaccinations, of which 47, or 85.45 per cent., were successful. The re-vaccinations were in most cases performed upon cases which had been unsuccessful in previous seasons, and hence the percentage of success is rather high. The above, I humbly presume to say, should be accepted as an exceedingly gratifying result, considering the smallness of our staff, the nature of the people with whom we have to deal, and the rugged and hilly character of the tract where we have had to work, in the midst of hardships and difficulties inconceivable. Superintendent's inspection. 10. The tabular statement given below shows the results of my inspections. My inspections were conducted on the same thorough system as last year. I would take up the work of one vaccinator at a time, and go on from village to village, minutely inspecting as many cases as I could find, and often comparing them with the registers kept. After finishing the work of one I would go over to another, and so on. On my approach in a certain locality, notice is sent through the chowkidars to the people of the villages which I would propose to inspect, directing them to keep their vaccinated children for inspection. Without such previous notice people are apt to go abroad to work in the fields and jungles, often taking their children with them. In order that I should not lose the opportunity of inspecting the people of as many villages as may have assembled to meet me, I would sometimes commence work in the morning, and would not cease till evening, when after a whole day's toil I would retire to take my meals and my night's rest in a poor lowly Sonthalee hut or a miserable cowshed, which are often the only shelters afforded us against wild beasts and biting frosts. In the course of my tours, I would also often take the opportunity to introduce vaccin- ation in villages where it has not been introduced before, and to remove doubts and suspicions from the minds of those who would question the protective influence of vaccination. Thus I would try to make the most of my time during each tour. From the month of January my attention being greatly directed to the outbreak of small-pox at Godda, my regular inspections were, to a certain extent, interfered with. Statement of inspection.

Twenty-two lives were sacrificed at Palasbona before the people gave us any notice of the outbreak; and even then, when we went to inspect in their village and explained to them the noble mission which had brought us there, they would not show us the cases that had occurred, or give us any certain information regarding them. Such, unfortunately, is the sad case with the people generally of this district. Rude and ignorant in the extreme, they exhibit a lamentable degree of apathy and indifference to the invasions of any epidemic disease, and are not roused from their lethargy until they see their village about to be depopulated. I am convinced that, were it not for the spread of vaccination and the extreme vigilance exercised by our men, most of these outbreaks of small-pox would never have come to light. The want of a regular police here, combined with the stupid inactivity of the people, rendered it extremely difficult to obtain information of these occur- rences. In eleven of the infected places mentioned above, including the town, vaccination was introduced; in seven of these it was completely established, and in four only partially so. Owing to the obstinate resistance of the people, it was not introduced in the three villages Kankjole, Islampore, and Newabdewree; and owing to the people being protected by vaccination in previous years, it was not undertaken in the two villages Gurgaon and Maharajpore, where the epidemic did not show any tendency to spread. Owing to the heat of the weather at this season, as already stated, extreme difficulty was experienced in affording protection to the infected localities. Many persons who had imbibed the poison were liable to be affected, even after vaccination had been performed and before it had taken effect; and this circumstance rendered us liable to distrust and suspicion. It was therefore under extremely disadvantageous circumstances that the work had to be carried on during the non-working season. Thirty-two cases of small-pox took place after vaccination, seven of which died. In these cases the vaccination had either failed, or the eruptions had appeared before the fifth day of the operation, when it had not taken effect. Twelve cases were ascertained to have occurred in persons who had old inoculation, five of which died. 13. During the working season, i.e. from October to March, the following villages in Rajmehal sub-division were known to have been infected, viz. Motyjhurna, Dhanbita, Oodwa, Jhubree, Banspahar, Rangamatea, Gadye, Puturchapti, Simuldhop, Pungro, Kelabaree, Tetulia, Ramchowkee, Pokhoria, and Hurnadanga. In these 15 villages, 107 cases, with 37 deaths, were known to have occurred. Seventeen of these deaths, or nearly half the total number, had occurred at Dhanbita, a hill village in the interior, whereas at Palasbona, mentioned above, the disease had been raging for months previously without any notice having been given us by the people. In 10 of the villages vaccination has been introduced, and the disease thereby checked. Nineteen of the cases of small-pox had taken place after vaccination, generally before the fifth day of the operation, two of which died. Two cases of old inoculation were known to have been affected, both of which died. Epidemic in Godda. 14. Towards the close of December 1873 information reached us of an epidemic of small-pox at Godda. The principal vaccinator of my staff, Peary Mohun Doss, was imme- diately ordered to the spot, with instructions to afford protection to the people of infected villages, and if possible to train up as many inoculators as he could find there, in order that they might be taken to assist him in stamping out small-pox. Subsequently another vaccinator was detached from my staff and sent to Godda. I myself went there in February, and found that vaccination was established in 13 infected villages. The epidemic was found to have spread itself very widely. I have already, in my special reports on small-pox, submitted a long list showing the villages infected and the total number of cases and deaths that had occurred. I need not therefore swell this report by an unnecessary repetition of the names of those villages. I think it will suffice to say, generally, that in pergunnah Godda, of the sub-division of Godda, we had up to the end of March 1874 a total number of 33 villages infected, of 269 cases, and 58 deaths; in pergunnah Barkop, 19 villagas, 180 cases, and 19 deaths; in pergunnah Muneehari, four villages, 25 cases, and five deaths; in pergunnah Pursunda, three villages, 14 cases, and one death; and in pergunnah Pusye, eight villages, 14 cases (besides several others in three of the villages, whose exact number could not be ascertained), and 21 deaths. Thus up to the end of March 1874 67 villages in the whole sub-division of Godda were known to have been infected, with a total number of 502 cases of small-pox, of which 140 died. Vaccination had up to the same period been established in 22 villages in pergunnah Godda, five in Barkop, one in Muneehari, and four in Pusye, giving a total of 32 villages protected more or less completely by vaccination. As in the case of Rajmehal sub-division, mentioned before, the disease in some of the villages of Godda was ascertained upon inquiry to have been raging since September or November 1873 ; and in the case of one village the outbreak was said to have commenced in February 1873, no notice having been given by the people till the epidemic had affected

For information on these points, I am indebted to the hospital assistant at Godda. to whom the inoculators used to submit their returns. Vaccine census. 21. The sub-joined statement, drawn up chiefly on the authority of my vaccinators, who furnished the necessary information, will convey some idea of the degree of protection enjoyed by the people:ABSTRACTS OF REPORTS FROM CIVIL SURGEONS. WESTERN DISTRICTS56 ABSTRACTS OF REPORTS FROM CIVIL SURGEONS. Vaccination was commenced by Dr. Hill on 15th November 1873, and the work was taken up by Mr. Conolly on the 15th December. He divided the district into four divisions, and allotted a gang of ex-inoculators to each, viz., Bishenpore, Onda, Bankoora, and Gunga- hatty. The Government vaccinator and the municipal vaccinator conducted the operations, and supervised the work of the converted inoculators. Small-pox of a severe type broke out in Bishenpore and in other places of the district. It assumed an epidemic form, and affected 69 villages. The civil medical officer exerted himself greatly to cope with the epidemic, and his efforts were attended at first with partial success. He travelled all over the district, and verified a large proportion of the operations. The total number vaccinated by the four gangs was 21,511, of which 17,934 or 83 37 were successful. Small-pox had almost died out, though a few cases lingered when the report was submitted. Three flying parties were organized to cope with fresh outbreaks. Mr. Conolly is of opinion that a few deserving and hard working ex-inoculators should be allowed something in the shape of retaining fee, as in.Midnapore. He again asks for a tent, and some personal allowance for the season, for the work of inspection. Midnapore district. Midnapore district.ABSTRACTS OF REPORTS FROM CIVIL SURGEONS. 57 Small-pox. &quot;11. Small-pox was not epidemic in any quarter of the district, except in some villages near the town of Tumlook, where it broke out during the last ten days of December. &quot; I inspected on two occasions the affected villages, and deputed an experienced vaccinator, named Sibdal Nusser, to assist the local men who did not appear to be making sufficient progress. &quot; The cases of small-pox that I saw were not of a severe type, and the disease, fortunately, did not spread to any incontrolable extent. Vaccination was carried on in about 31 villages, and 3,698 people were operated on. &quot; 12. This is the second season that vaccination has been introduced into this part of the country on the new system. The progress made has been satisfactory, and if this quarter of the zillah escapes the epedemic fever, I look forward to vaccination being established at Tumlook on as satisfactory and sound a basis as it has been for some years in the latter station. Inoculators. &quot; 13. Inoculators were not heard of during the past year, nor do I believe that in those parts of the district where the people were healthy much opposition to vaccination was offered by the villagers. &quot; 14. The most active opponent to vaccination, that I heard of during the past year, was a head-constable in charge of an outpost near Laranghur, who was pleased to place every obstacle in his power in the vaccinators way, and nearly brought the work to a stand-still by informing the people that they were being vaccinated with cow's fat, &c., &c. I brought the conduct of this man promptly to the notice of the district superintendent of police, who I believe transferred him to some less responsible appointment. Co-operation of civil authorities. &quot; 15. As in past seasons, I have been favoured with the influence and co-operation of the civil authorities, the importance of which in an undertaking of this kind cannot be overrated. The new vaccinators have all been appointed, and received certificates from the magistrate which has given them a status and an influence with the people which they would otherwise never have possessed, and as long as this system is so aided and supported it will certainly flourish and prosper sooner or later. Suppression of inoculation by law. &quot; 16. In conclusion, there is one point to which I beg to allude. I think the time has now come for suppressing by law the practice of inoculation throughout the district. For nearly six years inoculation has been prohibited by law within the municipal boundaries of the town, and I believe that the adoption of this measure was the principal reason that so many of the inoculators of the district abandoned their old calling. &quot; 17. The practice of inoculation has greatly fallen in public estimation, and I feel confi- dent that its prohibition by law would give the final blow to this baneful custom in the Midnapore district, and at the same time aid considerably our efforts to introduce vaccination. &quot; 18. Supposing, for argument's sake, that every inoculator in the district agreed to learn vaccination. Under present circumstances we are powerless to prevent inoculators from other districts coming into Midnapore, and spreading small-pox far and wide. &quot; 19. I am no advocate for the indiscriminate suppression by law of small-pox inocula- tion, which would leave the people without any form of protection, but in this case no fear of such a contingency exists, and I think the enforcement of this law in the Midnapore district would not be attended with any bad results.&quot; Hooghly.

The people are not very favorably disposed towards vaccination, though they were terrified by outbreaks of small-pox into a ready acceptance of the prophylactic. Dr. Shircore points out the very inadequate provision of the district as regards vaccination, and suggests that Moorshedabad should be included in one of the vaccination circles. Dinagepore.

The people are not adverse to vaccination, but it is said the frequent failures discouraged them, and they did not bring their children forward so freely as heretofore, when success had attended the first operations. Inoculation is practised in the town and district. No epidemic of small-pox occurred in the sudder station during the year. Mr. Davis noticed the percentage of unprotected among the prisoners to be 1.96, and among school-boys 11.1. Seven vaccinations are said to have been done by the assistant surgeon of the Doohye branch dispensary, of which only two were successful. At Serajgunge the municipality entertained one vaccinator on Rs. 10, from November to March. His operations were confined within the municipality, and were frequently inspected by Assistant Surgeon Kasi Kinkur Mitter: 559 persons are said to have been vaccinated, against 1,267 in the previous season, with a percentage of 59.2 successful cases.

The civil surgeon's plan was to perform systematic vaccination in section after section of the sudder station, and one village after another. The civil authorities gave every help. The two men performed 594 vaccinations, of which 326 were successful; and 181 re-vaccinations, with 52 successful cases. The civil surgeon inspected the work once a week, and was satisfied with its quality. The people in and around the town are beginning to see the benefits of vaccination. Inocula- tion is said to be almost universal in the district. No inoculator was trained. There was very little small-pox in the district, and the few cases that occurred were very successfully treated with carbolic oil. Dr. Cowan records several cases thus treated with the happiest results. At the Brahmunberiah branch dispensary one vaccinator was employed on Rs. 10 for three months, by the dispensary committee. He vaccinated 75 persons, of whom 67 were successful. The cases were inspected by the native doctor in charge of the dispensary. ASSAM AND ADJACENT HILLS. Goalpara.

Two thousand two hundred and seventy-seven persons are said to have been vaccinated, against 1,114 of the previous year, of whom 1,981 were successful. The work in the sudder station and its immediate neighbourhood was inspected once or twice every week, but that in the sub-division only once during the season. The people of the district are opposed to vaccination. Inoculation is largely practised in the interior. Notice was sent to all the police thanas, inviting inoculators to come forward and learn vaccination, but none came. Small-pox was prevalent in the district, but it did not assume an epidemic form during the year. Debrooghur district.

Causes of decrease as compared with last year. &quot; Of these 153, returns have been received from 98 only ; a few of the remainder are known to have left the district without operating, four or five having brought back their perwannahs, saying that they could get no practice this year. The returns received from these 98 men show 5,836 cases of vaccination, being a decrease of 2,200 as compared with last year. This is due chiefly to a large reduction in the number of operations in the Banka and sudder sub-divisions, in the former especially, the falling off there being nearly 3,000 cases, and attributable to the absence of a Bengali vaccinator, who alone operated nearly 2,000 cases last year under pressure of an existing epidemic of small-pox. The returns from Soopole and Muddehpoora show 29 against 21 only in the preceding season. This is remarkable, as these two sub-divisions include the most distressed portion of the district. It appears to indicate increased confidence in the vaccination, and to a much larger extent even than is shown by the figures, for from Soopole, returns have been received from only half the number of men who received perwannahs (40), while the actual number of returns is the same as last year, 20, the number of vaccinations, 164 last season, to 816 in the present. There is also a falling off of more than one-third the number of cases in the sudder sub-division as compared with the preceding season. The returns from this sub-division are, however, the most imperfect of all. &quot; Vaccination was also carried on at the various dispensaries by the subordinates in charge, though to a very limited extent only, as shown in the various returns. &quot; 6. The only paid vaccinators employed were Janky Ram, a man who had been attached to the sudder dispensary in that capacity for some years, and Amjad Hossain, a former com- pounder in the dispensary. These men were employed exclusively within the municipal district, and their outturn of work was considerably less than in the previous year. The reason they gave for this was that the people were unusually obstinate in urging objections by reason of the absence of small-pox this season, and consequent want of stimulus to them to prevent their children being attacked. &quot; 7. This was to some extent confirmed by a circumstance that came under my own observation; for, when inspecting vaccination in some villages a short distance beyond the municipal limits, the chief villagers came forward and told me that, in consequence of two children having been brought to a neighbouring village suffering from small-pox, they became alarmed and immediately sent for their vaccinator, and had caused all their children to be vaccinated. There was another reason, however, which was probably still more effectual. It was found when some work in the nature of relief works was opened in the municipality that scarcely any men offered themselves for employment. In consequence of the extensive relief works opened in the north of this and the neighbouring districts by Government, the men had migrated there leaving the women in charge of their homes, and these the vaccin- ators found far more difficult to deal with than the men. They repeatedly reported to me that on their appearance in a village the women ran away with their children and hid themselves or barricaded the entrances to their huts. The inoculators who were employed within the municipality also reported their inability to prevail with the people to submit their children for vaccination, though the reason they gave for it was that, in consequence of the high price of food, the people were unable to pay them. &quot; 8. Another and very strong reason for the smaller outturn of vaccination is the imper- fection of the returns; the plan suggested to obtain these was that the chowkidars of villages should report the number of persons vaccinated to the thana police officer at the time of his usual weekly report, while the vaccinators were to report to me direct; thus one set of returns would check the other. Instead of doing this, the subordinate police officers called on the vaccinators to report to them direct, thus obviating all the advantage to be gained by the plan recommended, while time is lost by the men having to travel unnecessarily many miles to the thanas; and having made their reports to the police, the men think it unnecessary to send me a return at all. Careless manner of keeping returns in the police thanas. &quot; 9. At the thanas, again, the returns are very carelessly kept; at one a register was shown me in which all cases of small-pox were entered indiscriminately with the vaccination ; at another I found four or five cases of vaccination only in the register though it was being carried on largely by several men in two large villages in the immediate neighbourhood. In one of these I found several cases of inoculations also, and from this no report had been received at all, though there are three chowkidars belonging to the village, and a police constable posted in it permanently.
70 ABSTRACTS OF REPORTS FROM CIVIL SURGEONS. &quot; 10. On representing these circumstances to the superintendent of police, I was informed that the men were fully occupied with work connected with the despatch of grain to the distressed districts, and could not give attention to vaccination affairs. &quot; 11. But few of the inoculators were fully at work before the middle of February, and consequently returns of their work did not reach me until well into March, by which period my time was fully occupied with arrangements connected with medical relief to the distressed districts, that it was difficult to leave the station for any considerable time. Inspection was therefore chiefly confined to the work in the sudder station division, and I visited a number of villages for this purpose both to the north and south of the river. In all these I found a large amount of good vaccination being carried on, and the people far more willing to submit to it than they are in the town. At one village, Narainpore, as already mentioned, I found several cases of inoculation at the same time that vaccin- ation was going on: these, I suspect, were done by the operators for their own reputation's sake; many of the people are not yet sufficiently cognizant that the vaccination is successful unless pimples appear on the body as in inoculation, and the operators therefore occasionally find it necessary to have a case of undoubted small-pox to satisfy those who are doubtful. &quot; 12. Wherever I went, however, I endeavoured to collect the people together, and to impress upon them the advantages to themselves of vaccination in preference to inoculation, and I usually found them perfectly willing to listen, and ready to trust their children to the village inoculator, whatever operation he might perform. Inspection of work. &quot;13. Inspection of vaccinators work in the town was carried on by myself and by the assistant surgeon constantly; though, from the scattered character of the various bazars comprising it, it is difficult either to carry on the work or to inspect it systematically. Frequent visits were made to that part which is occupied by Bengalis, who are usually well disposed to vaccination, and the influential portion of whom assist and encourage it. To the south of the town, also, an influential zemindar, Abdul Quadir Khan, gave good assistance, and I found the children in his neighbourhood generally vaccinated; elsewhere it was often very desultory, and the work of inspection most tedious, not unfrequently a journey of five or six miles being required to see not more than as many cases. &quot;14. Besides the paid vaccinators, 10 of the inoculators applied for permission to work in the town, which was granted ; they did not, however, meet with as much success even as the paid vaccinators, only 168 cases having been returned as performed by them; some of them brought back their perwannahs, saying that in consequence of the high price of food they could obtain no practice. &quot; 15. Three of these men were found to be inoculating small-pox, and were prosecuted and punished; in one case a death from small-pox having resulted from their proceedings ; and the evidence in these cases tended to show that the people themselves had not specially desired that their children should be inoculated in preference to being vaccinated. &quot; 16. In some few places arm-to-arm vaccination has been introduced; but it is by no means general, and crusts are far more generally made use of. The disadvantage of this is the constant necessity for new supplies, and it is found difficult to obtain them in sufficient number in the early part of the season. Purneah district.

In Deoghur the ex-inoculators are residents of the sub-division, but in Godda and Jamtara this is not generally the case. Civil surgeon's inspections. &quot; On different occasions the civil surgeon inspected 374 cases of vaccination, of which 215 were successful, giving a ratio of 57.4 * * * * This figure is very low, but I believe it fairly represents the amount of success attending operations by untrained men vaccinating from crusts.&quot; The civil authorities rendered great assistance. The civil surgeon detected the practice of inoculation in seven villages done by ex-inoculators, who had promised to vaccinate. Small-pox prevailed in the district generally; it was most severe in the sub-division of Godda. Here, between September 1873 and 31st March 1874, 637 cases with 102 deaths occurred in 98 villages. In addition to the six local men, two good vaccinators were at work from about the end of January. Small-pox also prevailed in other parts and caused several deaths. Dr. Cameron recommends that a number of trained vaccinators should be appointed to teach the ex-inoculators. COOCH BEHAR DIVISION.

In some instances, even, the moonda, or head of. a single village, had, at the instigation of an ex-inoculator applied to me that lymph may be given to the tekaits to vaccinate in his village. Other castes, likewise, have been willing to get vaccination performed in their villages; and there has not been any active interference against the performance of vaccination conducted by tekaits. Villagers have sometimes objected, however, but owing to two reasons: when they consider themselves unable to pay the Brahmins, and when a new tekait is inclined to take the place of their old one. This last objection will, in time, I have hopes, be got over, not by forcibly thrusting a new man in the village, but by persuasion. The people alone are not to blame for this. The tekaits themselves, considering certain areas as their vested rights for the purposes of vaccination, always try to frustrate any attempt that may be made to introduce a new man to take their place. A very good instance of this occurred during the season under report. Wishing to extend the vaccination area from Chyebassa, as a centre, I told one of the manleys that a vaccinator would be sent to work in his jurisdiction. He very willingly assented and I sent a tekait to him. On this coming to the ears of certain tekaits, who considered this manley's illaka as their vested right, they went to the manley, and by every means of persuasion in their power, even so far as to threaten him with dire results from the anger of their gods, if he allowed the other tekaits to vaccinate in his villages, tried to make him send away the vaccinator I had appointed. The manley very wisely came and reported the circumstances to me; and the deputy commissioner, on being informed, had the men sent for and judicially fined. They also received a warning from me that, on a repetition of such actions on their part, they may not be allowed to vaccinate at all. The punishment of these men will have a very good result on the others, and in time it may be possible to make these tekaits work wherever they are ordered. Ex-inoculators. Number protected. &quot;7. The register shows the names of 52 ex-inoculators. Among these, only four were added during the year, and one has been reported dead. Of the 51 registered tekaits, only 26, or half the number, applied for lymph. They worked in eighteen localities, and were allowed to retain their old beats, so far as this could be done without depriving certain areas of vaccination. In last year's report it was mentioned that certain vaccine centres were formed, which would be extended year by year. These were Chuckerdhurpore, 16 miles to the north- west ; Holdipookur, in Dhulbhum, 22 miles to the east; a part of the Colehan, six miles to the south-east; and Chyebassa central. Vaccinators were this year also made to work round their points. The Chyebassa centre has extended towards the east and south, and the Colehan centre to the south-east has also extended; but I have not been able to unite it to Chyebassa. There are still some villages intervening, and next season the protection of these will be taken in hand. Work has also been going on in the Holdipookur centre by two sets of vaccinators. The men set to work in Chuckerdhurpore, after vaccinating the remaining villages in their own beats not protected last year, came away, as they would not encroach on the beats of others. But from this point also the extent of protection has increased, as two vaccinators have been working in Kera Pir, which is adjoining Chuckerdherpore. Of the 18 sets of inoculators working in the district, 15 have submitted returns; against 12 sets of inoculators, and eight sets who submitted returns during last year. The number vaccinated, as shown in this return, is more than double that of last year, being 17,155 against 8,358. The number of villages vaccinated during the year was 291 against 120 last year. This is good season's work, if the results could be more closely inspected. Unfortunately I could inspect the work of only two. I visited sixteen villages and inspected 541 cases. Of these 254 only were very successful cases of vaccination, the vesicles being whole and well formed; 225 were very indifferent, the vesicles having burst and turned into ulcers; and 62 were quite unsuccessful. This result would give only 46.95 per cent. of successful cases, a very unsatisfactory result if only the best kind of vaccination, as it ought to be, should be insisted on. This I took every care to impress on the vaccinators ; and if inspection could be more methodically and frequently carried out, improvement would follow. But to inspect such a number of vaccin- ators' work, spread out in several parts of the district, requires at least one person who could devote his whole time to this work alone. &quot; In Chyebassa the numbers vaccinated were not many; 21 were vaccinated by the hospital assistant attached to the police, and 13 by me. Of these 34 cases, 30 were successful, or 88.23 per cent. &quot; Some catechists, attached to the Lutheran Mission, who were taught vaccination last season, have also vaccinated in Bandgown, the western limit of the district; but I am sorry to say I have received no return from them up to date. Small-pox. Number of deaths during the year. &quot; 8. There was no report during the year of an outbreak of small-pox in an epidemic form in any part of the district. But from the mortuary returns it appears that sporadic cases must have occurred, if what is shown in the mortuary returns as deaths from small-pox was really small-pox, and no other kind of eruptive disease. The returns show the number of deaths from small-pox to have been 32.

RESOLUTION. JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT. Calcutta, the 9th February 1875. READ( 2 ) 4. The amount of inspection work performed by the Superintendents of the various circles was satisfactory. The number of cases personally examined and verified with the registers was no less than 47,165 in the Metropolitan circle, 29,754 in the Darjeeling circle, and 21,269 in the Dacca circle. In the Ranchee circle the number was comparatively small, but the Superintendent appears to have moved freely about the country and. to have been careful in the supervision of his work. The Lieutenant-Governor observes that com- plaints are made of the inferiority of dispensary practice, and of the difficulty with which vaccinators who have engaged in it are induced to adopt correct methods. The returns furnished disclose great variations in the number of operations performed at the various dispensaries, and there seems to be little doubt that some of the vaccinators entertained there are inefficient. It is of the first importance that their work should be strictly supervised, more especially in the municipalities where inoculation is prohibited by law; and the Lieutenant-Governor trusts that the matter will have the continued atten- tion of the Medical Department. He would wish that in future reports a statement should be given of the amount of the work personally examined and verified by the Civil Surgeon, similar to that rendered in the case of the Circle Superintendents. 5. Judged by the number of operations performed on an average by each vaccinator, there has been, the Lieutenant-Governor is glad to notice, an improvement in the efficiency of the establishments entertained. The work performed in the Metropolitan circle and in the Sonthal Pergunnahs, which amounted on an average to 3,931 and 2,506 cases respectively, was particularly satisfactory. In the Darjeeling and Eastern Bengal circles some difficulty has been experienced in bringing up the staff of vaccinators to the full sanctioned number. In Julpigoree and the Hill Tracts of Darjeeling it is with difficulty that men are got to serve at all; but the Lieutenant-Governor trusts that Dr. Lidderdale will not relax his efforts to obtain recruits from among the resident population( 3 ) make similar efforts and will thereby obtain a similar success. So long as the ex-inoculators are under instruction, it may be necessary or advisable to give them a subsistence allowance, and the Lieutenant-Governor will receive favour- ably proposals to this effect. Once trained, however, they must distinctly understand that it is to their own exertions that they must look for support, though in special cases the Lieutenant-Governor will not be unwilling to grant a bonus to deserving men who have exerted themselves successfully and whose work has been inspected and approved. It is important that what- ever funds are available should be devoted to organizing an efficient system of inspection and control over the work performed by these men. The experience of successive years has demonstrated the danger of giving them the support of Government without any security against misconduct on their part. The present reports contain more than one instance where the work of the staff of Government vaccinators has been discredited, and where obstacles have been thrown in their way by the irresponsible action of ex-inoculators whose proceed- ings have been uncontrolled. 8. In Bankoora, where Dr. Conolly has interested himself very success- fully in the cause of vaccination, the Lieutenant-Governor has accordingly sanc- tioned a special establishment to supervise the inoculators whom he has trained, and, should the system be successful, the Lieutenant-Governor will be glad to extend it to other districts. It is particularly desirable that the Civil Surgeon of Beerbhoom should persevere in his endeavours to utilize the ex-inoculators whom he has already engaged in vaccination. In Midnapore operations were much interfered with by the epidemic of fever, which prevailed throughout the season, indisposing the people to vaccination and crippling the staff at the dis- posal of the Civil Surgeon, whose attention was necessarily much diverted to the establishment of endemic dispensaries. The Lieutenant-Governor trusts that in the current season more progress will be possible, and that a fair start will be given to a system which promises to be self-supporting. 9. During the year under report, small-pox was more than usually preva- lent in all the circles except the Darjeeling one. It was present in Calcutta throughout the year, and appeared also in the 24-Pergunnahs and Burdwan. It was particularly severe in Bankoora, Beerbhoom, and the Sonthal Pergunnahs. It was also epidemic in Hazareebagh and Lohardugga. Full advantage was taken of the circumstance to push forward operations, the people accepting vaccination the more readily when danger is at hand. Vaccinators detached from the Metropolitan staff protected nearly 10,000 persons in Beer- bhoom. In Bankoora more than twice that number were protected owing to the good arrangements made by the Civil Medical Officer. In the Sonthal Pergunnahs the staff of vaccinators at the disposal of the Deputy Superin- tendent was found to be quite insufficient. It has now been reinforced by the transfer of vaccinators from the Metropolitan circle, and will now, it is expected, fully meet the requirements of the Pergunnahs. 10. The results of the vaccine census, submitted with the present report, show that vaccination is making steady progress among the juvenile population. The Lieutenant-Governor has read with interest Dr. Charles' remarks on the degree of protection from small-pox which has been afforded to Calcutta in the past season by vaccination. 11. The fact that in several instances outbreaks of small-pox in districts to which Act IV (B.C.) of 1865 has been extended, were traced to the proceed- ings of inoculators should render Magistrates sensible of the necessity which exists for a strict enforcement of the law. The Lieutenant-Governor observes that the Surgeon-General is of opinion that a clear case has been made out forthe extension of the Act to Bogra and Dacca, and he will be ready to entertain proposals to this effect on their separate submission. The Act has since the close of the year been introduced into certain thanas of Jessore, and arrange- ments for extending it to the Sonthal Pergunnahs are being made.
( 4 ) 12. In conclusion, the Lieutenant-Governor thanks Dr. Campbell Brown and his subordinate officers for the efforts they have made to promote the work of the Department.

No. 719. FROM THE SURGEON-GENERAL, INDIAN MEDICAL DEPARTMENT, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL, JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT. Dated Fort William, the 14th September 1875. SIR, Abbreviation of report. I HAVE the honor to submit the report and returns of vaccination in the province of Bengal for the year ending the 31st of March 1875. In accordance with the orders issued by Government to that end, I have embodied the reports and returns submitted by superin- tendents in this general review of the results of the year, and rendered my remarks as brief as is consistent with a clear and complete representation of the subject. I have, however, considered it necessary to submit an abstract which I have had prepared of the reports rendered by civil surgeons, as a separate appendix, making it as concise as practicable.

The total for the year is thus rather within than above the mark, leaving out of account work done by ex-inoculators, of which returns have not been rendered. It is satisfactory to find that the increase is general, shared by all the circles (Ranchee excepted), and is apparent also in dispensary work. The amount of work done by the circle establish- ments amounted to 75.59 per cent. of the whole against 72.3 in 1873-74. The ratio of increase per cent. was as follows:FOR THE YEAR 1874-75. 3 Sex of those vaccinated. Comparison with previous years. A shght improvement manifest. Census results. STATEMENT No. V.

On the whole, with this reservation, it will be observed that vaccination reaches the different classes of the community pretty equally: and it is satisfactory to notice that the vaccine and census returns, collected on such a different system, for such different purposes, and so independently of each other, agree so closely.

The work done during the year, as contrasted with the preceding year, is clearly shown in the following statement: 6 REPORT OF VACCINATION IN BENGAL Cause of the comparative mildness of recent epidemics. The comparative immunity of Calcutta from small-pox since 1865, and the comparatively small dimensions of the past epidemic, may fairly be claimed as a triumph for vaccination. The satisfactory result thus exhibited is attributed by Dr. Charles to the better protection of the inhabitants and the increased power of vaccination to grapple with emergencies. He adds his testimony, derived from personal experience, in favor of the comparative mildness of this epidemic in support of the statistics. Localities visited by the disease. Small-pox in the suburbs 15. As usual, the epidemic was mainly limited to certain localities. Burra Bazaar, whose vaccination has presented peculiar difficulties, as explained in previous reports, suffered signally. The adjoining Muchooa Bazaar also suffered severely. A neighbouring community of Mahomedan lascars were severely visited, as also a class of Mahomedans called Nacodas, who came from Cutch 200 years ago, and colonised the heart of Calcutta in Moorgeehatta, Amratolla Lane, and New China Bazaar. In the southern division of the town, the disease was worst in the Taltollah Thana, at Harroo Luskur's Hât, Comedan Bagan, and Harreeparah Lane; in the Padoopookur Thana, Hyderam Bannerjee's Lane and Kerannee Bagan suffered considerably ; and scattered cases were met with in Fenwick Bazaar, Collingah, and Bow Bazaar. In the suburbs the disease, though widespread, also exhibited a tendency to locali- zation. There were sharp outbreaks at Zeerat, Garden Reach, and Kidderpore, and scattered cases at Tallygunge and Bhowanipore. In the northern suburbs there was a comparative exemption. Cases occurred in the Beliaghattah Thana (at Rajah Bagan and Rajah Bazaar) and in the Entally Thana. No cases were reported from the Cossrpore, Chitpore, Manicktollah, and Ooltadangah Thanas. These particulars have been thus fully detailed for the purpose of illustrating the property which epidemic diseases possess of predominant prevalence in particular places, and of recording in what manner this property was actually exhibited by small-pox in 1874-75. Particular classes affected. Residentscomparativelyexempt. Strangers specially liable. 16. The disease not only showed a proneness to affix itself to particular localities, but it likewise showed a tendency to attack particular classes of the community. The habitually resident Bengali population of Calcutta enjoyed the greatest exemption. This section of the com- munity is also the most efficiently protected by vaccination, and the cases which did occur in it took place principally among recent arrivals and temporary sojourners, whom it was found very difficult to vaccinate. In contrast, the up-country Hindustani residents, who are mostly a fleeting class, suffered severely. As a general rule, the epidemic prevailed rather among outsiders and strangers than among the proper population of the town. Immunity of young unvaccinated children. Cause. Young children should be exempted from compulsory vaccination. Reasons 17. Dr. Charles draws pointed attention to the great immunity which obtained among young unvaccinated children. He attributes this to oriental usage, which provides for the comparative seclusion of infants of tender years; and he draws from the circumstance the conclusion that, in the event of a law of compulsory vaccination ever being passed for India, it will not be expedient, as in England, to enact that every child must be vaccinated before the age of three months, because (1) the people have a strong prejudice against infant vaccin- ation founded on their experience of inoculation, and it would not be prudent to run counter to it; (2) the practice of vaccination in the hot weather and rains is not desirable on account of the frequent irritative results then met with; and (3) experience shows that young children are not liable to attack by small-pox if older children and adults are protected. Presentestablishmentsufficient. Superintendentscommended. 18. Dr. Charles, after the experience of this trying and anxious year, arrives at the conclusion that the present establishment is quite equal to the duties required of it. He accords high praise to the superintendents, Baboos Kali Das Bose and Kassi Chunder Dutt. On the former, as in charge of the northern division of the town, the brunt of the work of stamping out frequently recurring outbreaks of small-pox mainly fell, and he acquitted himself admirably, and displayed great tact and diligence in dealing with these. I need hardly add that Dr. Charles himself continues to apply himself to this very important duty with his usual energy and enthusiasm. METROPOLITANCIRCLESSuperintendence. Establishment. 19 Metropolitan Circles.FOR THE YEAR 1874-75. 7 Employment during non-working season. 21. During the non-working season most of the vaccinators were employed in taking &quot; vaccine census &quot; and stamping out small-pox. Their services were required for the latter purpose in the north-eastern part of the 24-Pergunnahs, where the disease had been lighted up by inoculation, and in the Sonamookhy and Bood-Bood thanas of Burdwan. As many of the men as were not wanted were permitted to proceed to their homes on leave. Project for the season's work. 22. A plan for the season's work was, as usual, submitted in time, and, after consulting the local civil authorities, approved by Government. The following are the particulars of the scheme :8 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BENGAL Cost of vaccination. 26. Owing to the large amount of work overtaken, the cost of each successful case has fallen to Re. 0-1-6, &quot; the lowest cost ever shown in the Metropolitan or any other vaccine circle.&quot; The quality of the vesicle and amount of success obtained are also stated to be excellent. Superintendent's tour of inspection. Inspection bydeputysuperintendents. 27. The superintendent details his tours of inspection, which extended to every part of the circles under his charge where work was being carried on. A hurried visit was made in the earlier part of the season to ascertain that a good commencement had been made, and more leisurely and systematic inspections subsequently carried out. Every gang, with one exception, was visited once, and some twice and three times. The deputy superintendents were also assiduously employed in supervising and verifying the work of their circles. In the first circle 58.55 per cent. of the vaccinations were seen; in the second, 51.28; and in the third 56. The following is the record of the results of inspection by the superintendent:FOR THE YEAR 1874-75 9 24-Pergunnahs. &quot; Twenty-three outbreaks took place in the 24-Pergunnahs, affecting one village in thana Satkhirah, nineteen in Kullaroa, five in Barrackpore, two in Burranuggur, one in Ariada, twelve in Sudder, one in Mothoorapore, one in Dum-Dum, two in Baraset, one in Sooltanpore, two in Badooriah, one in Bankipore, two in Busseerhaut, and one in Kalligunge. Hoogbly. Nuddea. Jessore. &quot; Two outbreaks occurred in Hooghly, affecting two villages in thana Buddybattee and one in Hooghly. Two were reported from Nuddea, affecting two villages in thanas Saursa and Gyeghatta respectively, and one from Jessore, where it affected one village only in thana Moneerampore.&quot; Vaccinators supplied to municipalities, &c. 30. In addition to the proper work of the circles, 20 vaccinators were supplied to muni- cipalities, townships, and private individuals for varying periods, and these men vaccinated 7,348 cases with a percentage of success of 99.05. The results have been embodied in table No. V. Results of vaccine census 31. Many of the vaccinators were employed after the close of the season in taking vaccine census in the thanas where operations had been conducted. The general results of these census are as follows:10 REPORT OF VACCINATION IN BENGAL Dinagepore. Area vaccinated. The Rajbari gang Rungpore. Area vaccinated.

Delay in reporting outbreaks. disease also prevailed in certain tea gardens, Tukvar, Tukdah, and Phoolsering, in the Darjeeling district, having been imported from Nepal Vaccination was immediately and energetically, resorted to, and the disease thus prevented from spreading. In all 72 cases with 36 deaths occurred. Dr. Lidderdale remarks on the greater fatality of the disease in the hills and among hill races, and attributes it to the lower degree of civilization of these tribes. The climate and habits of the people have also no doubt some influence in producing this result. In the plains vaccination was resorted to whenever a report of small-pox was received, but intimation of outbreaks is often so tardily given by the police, that it is difficult either to discover their cause or limit their spread Licensed vaccinators. Importance of instruction and supervision. 38. Dr. Lidderdale was unable to procure &quot;inspectors of licensed vaccinators&quot; on account of the small pay which he was authorised to offer. This has now been increased, and it is hoped that he will experience no difficulty in getting suitable men for the important duty next season; for, as he truly indicates, the two most important points connected with a scheme of licensing vaccinators who may practice as private vaccine practitioners are instruc- tion and supervision. Without these no system of self-supporting vaccination can be expected to succeed. There seems, in the Darjeeling circle, to be no lack of candidates for licenses, and under Dr. Lidderdale's active and conscientious supervision the system promises in time to work well. Supplies of lymph. 39. Supplies of lymph were furnished by the Darjeeling circle to several regimental and civil surgeons. General conclusion. 40. On the whole the report of the past season indicates marked progress, and much credit is due to Dr Lidderdale for the energy and thoroughness with which he applies himself to his important duties.

The operations of apprentices were distributed with the parties, and amounted to 10,605 cases and 9,761 successful, or 94.3 per cent. Sum total. &quot; 20. Taken as a whole, the agency as paid by the state has afforded a total throughout the circle of 59,818 cases, of which 51,518 may be taken as successful. The average ascertained successful cases among the examined was 94.31 per cent., and the percentage has been used for the whole. If we place against this number the cost of inspection, the cost per case comes to six pie. General conclusion. &quot; There is no doubt that with a little judicious cultivation the unpaid agency could be made to produce a very much larger return, but it will require great care and not a little labour and perseverance. Meanwhile the tendency of the Manbhoom men to pass over towards the tributary states to the west, which are without the circle, should not be lost sight of, but their annual immigration regularly encouraged as long as there is no supply of resident vaccinators to take their place. Superintendence necessary &quot; 21. Native superintendence for the unpaid agency.14 REPORT OF VACCINATION IN BENGAL Establishment. Increase. 51. The establishment of vaccinators underwent a considerable increase consequent on the demands occasioned by outbreaks of small-pox. Six extra men on a salary of Rs. 8 per mensem were sanctioned by Bengal Government letter No. 2147, dated 5th June 1874, and of these four men were entertained on the 21st June and two on the 21st July. Four of them were new to the work, and though their services were available throughout the season, as much work could not be expected from them as from experienced men. Again, by Govern- ment of Bengal letter No. 4443, dated 4th December 1874, the transfer of the services of one native superintendent and thirteen vaccinators from the Metropolitan circles was sanc- tioned, but under a misapprehension the transfer was rather nominal than real, the men having been merely attached as supernumeraries to Dr. Gupta's circles. They were therefore a direct accession to the Sonthal Pergunnahs staff. They joined in January and February, but owing to some difficulty about their pay and other causes three of them absconded. Vaccination and small-pox in the hot season. 52. Owing to the prevalence of small-pox during the hot weather of 1874, vaccination was carried on in every month, except September, with a view to stamp out the disease. These operations were limited to the sub-divisions of Godda, Pakour, and Rajmehal. Consider- able difficulty was experienced in keeping up the supply of lymph, because the cold-weather crusts were found useless, and the people object to arm-to-arm vaccination. A supply was, however, procured from Darjeeling, which enabled the vaccinators to continue their work. The hot-weather vaccinations amounted to 2,495, with a percentage of success of 84.04. Plan of theseason'soperations. 53. The plan laid down for the season's operations was, generally, to extend the areas vaccinated in Rajmehal and Pakour in previous years, and to employ the localities where vaccination had been performed in Sultanabad and Godda for the suppression of small-pox as nuclei of more extended operations. Newly entertained men were placed in proximity to more experienced vaccinators for purposes of instruction and supervision. When the new men joined in January and February, they were posted to other sub-divisions, Nya Doomka Deoghur, and Jamtara. When outbreaks of small-pox were reported, men were detached to stamp them out, and care was taken not to interfere with ex-inoculators practising vaccination, but rather to encourage and direct them.

The following is a detailed record of his work:18 REPORT OF VACCINATION IN BENGAL in such cases are well trained men provided by the superintendent of the Metropolitan circles. The two southern sub-divisions of Jessore are still without vaccination, but they are to be systematically vaccinated next season. An attempt to establish self-supporting vaccin- ation in the Magoorah sub-division of the same district has failed for want apparently of proper supervision. Moorshedabad. Rajshahye division. Pubna. Vaccination by apprentices at Lallpore. In the Moorshedabad district vaccination is systematically performed in the cities of Berhampore and Moorshedabad, and a few municipalities in the interior employ vaccinators ; but the district may be said to be without the means of vaccination, and both the magistrate and civil surgeon consider that it ought to be included in a vaccine circle. The amount of vaccination done in the districts of the Rajshahye division, in addition to the operations of the Darjeeling circle, is very meagre. Pubna, which is not included in the circle, is very specially backward. The proceedings of the apprentices at Lallpore, in Rajshahye, show how necessary intelligent direction and supervision are in all vaccine efforts. Spurious vaccination is worse than no vaccination, because it implants a feeling of security when there is really no protection. Orissa division. Eastern districts. Dacca. Dacca division. Chittagong division. Vaccination is very backward in the Orissa division, and is limited to the sudder stations and dispensaries, and their vicinity. Dr. Hill, the civil surgeon of Pooree, made an attempt to induce inoculators to practice vaccination, but failed. The people are prejudiced, and inoculation is rampant. In the Eastern districts good work has been done by the Eastern Bengal circle of vaccination, but its operations have as yet been almost entirely confined to the Dacca district, which however has been pretty thoroughly done. No details have reached me regarding the vaccination of the city of DaccaFOR THE YEAR 1874-75. 19 Exemption ofvaccinateddistricts. State of habitually inoculated districts. Transition districts. &quot; Stamping out&quot; outbreaks of small- pox. in this province. As the prevalence of small-pox in the province has been very fully and instructively described in the report of the Sanitary Commissioner (page 24), which has already come under the notice of Government, I need not repeat the information here. Dr. Coates has drawn pointed attention to the exemption of vaccinated districts. It is also fair to state that districts which are habitually inoculated showed also a low small-pox mortality. In such districts small-pox deaths must be very nearly a constant quantity. The districts which suffered most are those in which a struggle between inoculation and vaccination is going on (Bankoora and Sonthal Pergunnahs for example). Dallying with vaccination is a dangerous practice in this country, and if the mortality which is annually due directly and indirectly to inoculation is to be reduced or abolished, arrangements must be made for complete and exhaustive vaccination of all the unprotected. The reports show that excellent results followed upon the practice of stamping out outbreaks of small-pox, i.e., vaccinating every- body in and around the contaminated locality when the system was properly practised. Prevalence of the practice of inoculation. Necessity of decided measures. 75. Inoculation is still very extensively practised in the province, more particularly in Eastern Bengal, Orissa, and Behar. That the people can be easily weaned from the per- nicious practice, the experience of the circles of vaccination fully proves. There can be no question that a large and unnecessary mortality is being caused by the practice, and that its prohibition, when efficient vaccination is substituted, is an unmixed good. These two things must always go together, but the more quickly and extensively they are spread over the pro- vince the better. A transition state when vaccination is desultory and partial, and inoculation stealthily performed here and there, is fraught with very great danger, and this is the predica- ment into which many districts are now drifting. It is very doubtful if any district is so completely inoculated as to reduce the inevitable mortality consequent on the practice to the minimum; and the progress of vaccination, if it is not, so to speak, driven home at once, is up to a certain point one of increasing hazard. On these grounds I would very strongly press the need of largely extending systematic and exhaustive vaccination in Bengal, inoculation being simultaneously prohibited and resolutely suppressed. Vaccine census. 76. Medical officers have forwarded &quot; vaccine census,&quot; which have been compiled into a table which appears in the appendix. I have already remarked on the importance of infor- mation of this description being beyond doubt, and trust that officers will not in future entrust the collection of such data to their subordinates. As a test of how the inhabitants of particular localities are protected from small-pox, such statements are very valuable, and their record in these reports will constitute a most important material for comparison, and a good means of estimating the progress of vaccination. General conclusion. 77. The history of vaccination in Bengal during 1874-75, which I have set forth in detail in the preceding paragraphs, contains a large element of progress, and is suggestive of satisfaction and hope; but very much more than has been accomplished still remains to be done ere the province can be pronounced to be as safe from small-pox as vaccination can render it, and this, I would submit, is the end which must be steadily held in view until it has been entirely compassed. I have the honor to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, K. McLEOD, A.M., M.D., J. FULLARTON BEATSON, M.D., Secretary. Offg. Surgeon-General, Indian Medical Department.

It does not appear from the report that any very active opposition to vaccination was experienced either in the town or district; on the contrary &quot; in many villages in the interior the inhabitants have begun to appreciate vaccination.&quot; Although inoculation is not prohibited by law, it is not practised in the town and its environs ; it is, however, largely practised in the interior. Regarding the steps taken to instruct inoculators, the civil medical officer reports that he endeavoured to get a few, but did not succeed. &quot; The inoculators would not enlist as free vaccinators unless inoculation is prohibited by law; they gain more by inoculation than they would by vaccination, as the former requires their attendance oftener on the person operated upon than the latter.&quot; There was no epidemic of small-pox during the year.

If inoculation was made punishable, these men would be got for comparatively trivial remuneration; at the same time one of the greatest bars to the present progress of vaccination would be removed.&quot; As regards the attitude of the people, he remarks30 ABSTRACTS OF REPORTS BY CIVIL SURGEONS.

Of the 55, however, only 18 worked during the season in 13 parties. As far as possible, they were made to extend the area of protection from the centres worked in the previous season. The Chyebassa centre has extended south-east and south, taking a westerly course in order to unite with the Chuckerdhurpore centre. At the same time working parties were sent to Khersowah and Kerapies, working up to the other centre. A large tract of Khersowah and Kerapies have been vaccinated during the season, but the extent is too large. and it will take two or three seasons to complete it, especially as certain beats are considered in the sense of vested rights, and it is found difficult to introduce a strange inoculator in the beats of others. Amount of work done. With the exception of one vaccinator all the others have submitted returns. The numbers vaccinated, although less than the year before, still show a fair number, and prove that the people do not object to vaccination. The number shown in the returns is 12,068, against 17,155 of the previous year. The number of villages vaccinated is 170, against 291 the year before. Dispensary vaccination. Besides the above, the dispensary vaccinations at Chyebassa by the hospital assistant were 50, giving a percentage of 84.00 successful cases. Inspection The area of vaccination is too extensive to enable me to inspect the work of all the vaccinators, and I could only inspect that of four parties, visiting 35 villages and seeing 1,628 cases. Of these 1,171 were successful cases, 315 were doubtful, and 142 were unsuccessful, giving 71.92 successful cases. Vaccination in this district is self-supporting, as, with the exception of Rs. 55 for travelling allowance, Government has incurred no other expenditure Besides the operations above described, carried out in this district during the year, some vaccinators, under the Superintendent of Vaccination of the Ranchee circle, also visited the district for the purpose of vaccinating.

G. PILCHER, Officiating Sanitary Commissioner for Bengal. W. H. D'C.MEDICAL. CALCUTTA, THE 11TH NOVEMBER 1875. RESOLUTION. READ( 2 ) must observe that the conduct of operations in this circle demands the closest attention on the part of the Medical Department. With the very large increase to the establishment allotted to it in the past year, it is difficult to believe that the failure in obtaining adequate results has not, in part at least, been due to some inefficiency or neglect on the part of the Civil Surgeon and of the inspecting staff placed at his disposal. 5. There is little to remark regarding the sex, caste, and age of the vacci- nated. The results are very similar to those obtained in previous years,( 3 ) certain districts. From the report now submitted, he regrets to observe that the matter has not received that attention at the hands of most civil surgeons which it deserves. Indeed, it is gathered from the Surgeon-General's narrative that, up till a very late date, he had received no reports or returns whatever on this subject from certain officers. Other officers, while interesting them- selves in the matter, apparently failed to appreciate the importance of working in a systematic manner. In the Sonthal Pergunnahs, and in certain districts of the Chota Nagpore division, licenses to practice appear to have been given to men, the result of whose operations have shown them to have been utterly untrained. Again, in a great many cases no attempt appears to have been made to supervise the work of those to whom licenses were granted. While the Lieutenant-Governor is aware that in educating and in settling ex-inocu- lators it may not be possible to follow out strictly the system of concentrated operations which he has prescribed for circle vaccination, he yet thinks that much may be done in this direction, and he would call the immediate attention of all civil surgeons to the matter, thereby reminding them that the remarks by Government, as contained in the Resolutions on the annual reports, are meant to be for the practical guidance of all concerned, and are expected to be acted upon. At the instance of the Surgeon-General, provision has been made for the entertainment, in those districts where the greatest progress has been made in training ex-inoculators, of a sufficient inspecting staff. Rules have also been drawn up and sanctioned under which licenses for the practice of vaccination are to be granted, as well as rewards to such of the independent practitioners as may show the most successful results. In giving effect to these rules, care should be taken not to assign too large an area to each ex-inoculator, and to secure on the whole compact circles of inspection, and these circles should be gradually and effectually protected before other circles are taken up. 10. As regards individual districts, the Lieutenant-Governor observes that very favourable mention is made of the continued interest which Dr. Conolly of Bankoorah has shown in promoting vaccination. The train- ing of ex-inoculators there has proceeded, under his supervision, with very satisfactory results, and His Honor desires that an expression of the thanks of Government may be conveyed to Dr. Conolly for the energy and zeal displayed by him in this matter. In Midnapore, on the other hand, where the system of self-supporting vaccination and ex-inoculators had been fairly started, little or no progress has been made, and, owing to the absence of proper supervision, the results are not so satisfactory as they should have been. In the Sonthal Pergunnahs the question of training and employ- ing ex-inoculators should have the careful attention of the Surgeon-General when taking up the question of systematising the operations of the circle vaccinators. The question of opening out two new circles of vaccination for the Orissa and Patna and Bhagulpore divisions is now under the consideration of the Govern- ment. As regards the Darjeeling circle, the Lieutenant-Governor observes that it is stated that there is no lack of candidates to practise as licensed vaccinators. As the entertainment of no less than 42 apprentices on the staff of this circle has been sanctioned, he trusts that there will be no difficulty in selecting men who have undergone a complete training in the art, and that every encouragement will be given to such men to settle down as independent practitioners. 11. In the Orissa division vaccination is still limited to the sudder stations and to the dispensaries in their immediate vicinity. In some of the districts of the Patna division self-supporting vaccination has been initiated with some promise of success, and a few ex-inoculators have been converted and are now practising. In the Bhagulpore division greater progress appears to have been made, and it is gratifying to learn that so much has already been done in the districts of this division to promote a self-supporting system of vaccination. 12. In his Minute already referred to, Sir Richard Temple observed that the proper, perhaps the only, test of success in regard to vaccination is the total disappearance of small-pox. From the table appended to the present report, it is observed that the total number of deaths from this disease registered in Bengal in the year under review was 11,948, against
( 4 ) 11,017 in 1873. Judged by this primary test, then, we must acknowledge, with great regret, that no head has been made in the country generally against this disease. The Lieutenant-Governor expects, however, that this considera- tion will have the effect of stimulating our officers to further efforts. The better test will, however, be the examination of the statistics of the disease in those particular localities where vaccination work has been concentrated in the manner recently laid down. And the Lieutenant-Governor hopes that this will be done in future annual reports. 13. The fact that the outbreak of this disease is in a great many cases traceable to the operations of inoculators, has often been pressed on the notice of Government. The prohibition of inoculation where efficient vaccination is substituted is, as remarked by the Surgeon-General, an unmixed good. Still the day when it can be generally prohibited in these provinces appears to be yet far distant, unless greater efforts can be put forth than those which have been heretofore made. The Lieutenant-Governor hopes that this consideration will sink into the minds of all district officers in whose jurisdiction vaccination has not yet been fully organized, as there are few districts where the existing staff of vaccinators is sufficient. In the Metro- politan circles the Lieutenant-Governor is glad to observe that the number of vaccinations performed is estimated to be more than sufficient to meet the requirements of the population in this respect, and there accordingly inocula- tion has been prohibited, as well as in other places where proper and sufficient arrangements have been made to carry on vaccination. Still, however, inocu- lators are found to practise, and so long as this is the case, the Lieutenant- Governor cannot absolve the local magistracy from the charge of apathy and indifference. In Calcutta itself, though inoculation has long been prohibited, scattered outbreaks of the disease continue to occur. The figures given by Dr. Charles, to show the effect which vaccination has had in repressing the disease, are very interesting. They seem to prove that comparatively large as was the number of deaths from small-pox in the town during the past year, they yet represent but a very small proportion of the results of such an epidemic as might reasonably be expected to occur in Calcutta every fifth or sixth year in the absence of vaccination. 14. In conclusion, the Lieutenant-Governor would express his concur- rence with the opinion of the Surgeon-General that the history of vaccination in Bengal during 1874-75 contains some (though not sufficient) element of pro- gress, and is suggestive of hope for greater things in future. Sir Richard Temple has also to thank the Surgeon-General and his subordinate officers for the efforts they have made to promote the work of the department.

Though the work fell short as compared with 1874-75, still, as Dr. Charles shows, the numbers were higher than those of any of the previous five years:6 REPORT OF VACCINATION IN BENGAL Programme embracing the season's operations. 19. A sensible programme embracing the season's operations which was prepared by Dr. Gupta, and by me submitted formally to Government, was approved and sanctioned after due consultation with the local civil authorities. The vaccinators were sent out in the middle of September, after the usual preparations had been made, viz. the local civil authorities were informed and requested to give every aid. The work of the season was partly carried on in the southern half of the district of JessoreFOR THE YEAR 1875-76. 7 434 villages, situated in 33 thanas and five districts, and inspected over 46,500 cases. The following table shows the result of his inspection: 8 REPORT OF VACCINATION IN BENGAL Joynuggore, one in Nawabgunge, one in Assasoonee, two in Bankipore, two in Sooltanpore, one in Nyehatty, one in Bishtopore, and one in Mothoorapore.

Howrah. &quot; Two outbreaks occurred in the district of Howrah, affecting six villages in thana Domjoor, and one in Juggutbullubpore. &quot; One was reported from Jessore, affecting one village in thana Dalootee.&quot; Vaccinators supplied to municipalities, &c. 25. Several municipalities and a few private individuals applied for and obtained the services of trained vaccinators from the staff of the Metropolitan circles, for periods varying from one to six months, and at the rate of Rs. 12 per month. About 6,000 vaccinations were thus done by their instrumentality. Results. 26. The results of the Metropolitan circles are very satisfactory, and exceedingly credit- able to Dr. Gupta and his assistants Rai Jadub Chunder Ghose Bahadoor, Rai Ram Soondur Ghose Bahadoor, and Buddy Nath Brummo. The first-named assistant, Rai Jadub Chunder Ghose Bahadoor, is singled out for special praise for returning the largest number ever given, and deserves the favourable notice of Government. The Metropolitan circles have contributed one-half of the total number of vaccinations done in the whole of Bengal, and the work was of a high order, as proved by the personal inspection of the Superintendent and his deputies. For such good work increasing year after year, and with the lowest average cost (Re. 0-1-3), Dr. Gupta and his assistants are entitled to all the credit which is usually bestowed upon the good and faithful servants.

In all 932 villages in Dinagepore were visited by the establishment, and 22,560 persons were vaccinated; so that now six thanas in this district are reported to be protected. In addition to the work of the establishment, 1,357 persons were protected by the licensed vaccinators under Inspector Khetter Mohun Bose. Rungpore Area vaccinated. Rungpore.10 REPORT OF VACCINATION IN BENGAL Small-pox during 1875. 32. There was not much small-pox in the Darjeeling circle during the year 1875. No cases were reported from RungporeFOR THE YEAR 1875-76. 11 circle, vaccination was also carried on by the ex-inoculators of Manbhoom. Altogether 75 ex-inoculators were employed during the season in the district of Manbhoom ; they visited 748 villages and vaccinated 48,495 persons, of whom 26,872, or 77 per cent., were inspected by the Civil Surgeon, Mr Wilson. In the Singhbhoom district 14 ex-inoculators worked and vaccin- ated 8,205 cases, of whom 3,504 were verified by the Civil Surgeon, Mr. Manook. Hazareebagh. In Hazareebagh several ex-inoculators received perwannahs to carry on vaccination, but they have submitted no returns of their work. They should have been made to do so, or measures taken to prohibit them from continuing to carry on their operations. Lohardugga. In Lohardugga 27 inoculators were employed in vaccination with the superintendent's perwannah, and worked in almost all the thanas in the district. Fifteen of them returned 7,963 operations, but without any information regarding the rate of success12 REPORT OF VACCINATION IN BENGAL with four deaths, and 26 from Godda with three deaths. In 40 villages vaccination was perform- ed to arrest the spread of the disease, while in twoFOR THE YEAR 1875-76. 13 Supervision by the Superintendent 52. Mr. Lyons travelled a good deal, and carefully supervised the work in the Furreedpore district. He visited 245 villages, and inspected upwards of 13,000 cases. His inspection verified a success of 99.64 per cent. The operations in the Dacca dis- trict were supervised by the Deputy Superintendent. Mr. Lyons complains that he experienced many inconveniences and difficulties in the course of his inspection. As he received no travelling allowance, he had to walk from village to village. I would suggest that he should receive something in the shape of travelling allowance, viz. Rs. 50 a month, which will enable him to keep a pair of riding ponies like the Civil Surgeons of Midnapore and Bankoora, who are allowed Rs. 50 for six months annually for inspecting vaccine operations in their respective districts Attitude of the people. 53. Regarding the attitude of the people, Mr. Lyons says the masses receive vaccin- ation without much persuasion. The Hindoos are more amenable to argument than Mussul- mans, who, as a rule, give considerable trouble. Census in the Dacca district. 54. A census was taken in the Dacca district. 306,337 persons, belonging to 1,506 villages, were examined with the following result:14 REPORT OF VACCINATION IN BENGAL errors been fairly attributable to inexperience only.

Moorshedabad. out by Dr. Gupta in a separate communication on the subject, the success of the scheme depends on competent supervision, and on the invariable adoption of arm-to-arm vaccination, instead of the use of crusts, which always prove unsatisfactory in the hands of the careless ex-inoculators, though I think this adjective should never be justly appli- cable where a certificate of fitness has been given. It should only be granted where men have established their character for thorough efficiency. No report has been received from Midnapore, though I have repeatedly called for it. In Beerbhoom vaccination was con- fined to the civil station of Sooree and its vicinity. Vaccinators were also sent to stamp out small-pox in the interior of the district. Of the districts included in the Presidency division, the whole of the 24-Pergunnahs, Nuddea, and Jessore, are systematically vaccinated by the Metropolitan circles. Several townships and municipalities employed vaccinators. This is a commendable practice, inasmuch as it forms a nucleus of self-supporting vaccin- ation. The vaccinators in such cases are well trained men provided by the Superintendent of the Metropolitan circles. Moorshedabad, which has been transferred to the Presidency division, is not included in any vaccine circle. Vaccination was performed in the cities of Berhampore and Moorshedabad, and also in some of the branch dispensaries. Dr. Shircore again urges the necessity of transferring the district to one of the vaccine circles, and the Magistrate supports the proposal. Rajshahye division Rungpore Bogra Orissa division. All the districts in the Rajshahye division (Pubna excepted ) are included in the Darjeeling circle of vaccination. In addition to the circle work, all the districts exhibit some improvement. In Rungpore Dr. K. D. Ghose had some additional vaccinators enter- tained by zemindars, and thereby got a good deal of work done. The vaccinator in Maldah performed very few vaccinations (107), considering he was employed for four months. Pubna is, as usual, very backward. In Bogra the numbers fell short very considerably of the previous year. The Orissa division has this season been formed into a vaccine circle with Cuttack as head-quarters; but as operations were commenced in the month of January only, and as the Superintendent was a novice in vaccine work, very little work was accomplished. Vaccinators were also attached to the dispensaries and municipalities of Cuttack,Pooree, and Balasore, and they did good work under the supervision of the Civil Surgeons. Eastern districts. The Eastern districts, composing the Dacca division, are all included in the Eastern Bengal vaccine circle. The amount of work done by the circle staff was confined to two districts16 REPORT OF VACCINATION IN BENGAL FOR THE YEAR 1875-76. Diminution of small-pox. deaths; but even in those districts there would still be a favourable comparison with the amount of disease and mortality which happened in 1874. On the whole the past year shows a great diminution of small-pox. Inoculation still practised in many districts Act IV (B.C.) of 1865 68. Inoculation is still practised in many districts, as reported by Civil Surgeons and their subordinates; but whether it is attended with any large mortality, is a point which it is most difficult to ascertain. That the practice is pernicious there cannot be any doubt, since it gives rise to small-pox, which always endangers the safety of a community. It ought, therefore, to be prohibited where a sufficient provision has been made for vaccination; and this is being steadily carried out. The Act IV (B.C.) of 1865, prohibiting the practice of inoculation, is gradually being extended to all towns and districts where a sufficient vaccin- ating agency exists. The happiest results must follow. The Act in question is in operation in Calcutta, the Metropolitan circles, Chota Nagpore, Sonthal Pergunnahs, Bogra, and Dacca districts, and to almost all sudder stations. The provisions of the Act will probably be soon extended to Orissa, Behar, and Eastern Bengal, whenever in fact the staff of the several vaccine circles shall be able to complete their protection to the point which alone justifies its enforcement. Vaccine census. 69. A vaccine census was collected by the vaccine circles, and also by the Civil Surgeons and medical subordinates, and these have been compiled into table No. VI in the appendix. The figures for jail convicts are perfectly reliable, and show that between 60 or 75 per cent. of convicts are inoculated. As prisoners are never inoculated in jails, the ratio of the inoculated may fairly be taken to represent the degree of protection which exists in the community by the practice of inoculation. In the same way the figures for schools may be taken as a very fair standard of the amount of protection conferred on the juvenile population by means of vaccination. The ratio for different districts and parts of Bengal varies from 8 in Behar and Orissa, where vaccination is still very backward, to 82 per cent. in places where vaccination has become the established custom. But as all the returns have not been very carefully supervised, and as they belong to different districts, no general conclusion can safely be drawn from them. General conclusion. 70. In conclusion, I have to observe that though the number of vaccinations during the year has not undergone any great increase as compared with 1874, still much has been done to extend vaccination. His Honor the Lieutenant- Governor has taken a deep interest in this very important department of preventive medicine. Two new circles were opened during the year, and provision was made for placing the self-supporting system of vaccin- ation by converted inoculators on a better basis, by the appointment of inspectors to some of the districts. When all the vaccine circles shall work without any hitch or friction, and when all converted inoculators shall carry on vaccination on a correct system and under competent supervision, the province of Bengal will become as completely protected from small- pox as vaccination can render it. This is the end which is being steadily kept in view ; and with the Government thoroughly interested, and the vaccine establishment fully alive to the call for continued exertion to accomplish this most desirable consummation, I sincerely trust the day may not now be very far distant when it may justly be regarded as un fait accompli. I have the honor to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, J. FULLARTON BEATSON, M.D., Surgeon-General, Indian Medical Department.

Of his work, that done in the town was inspected by the Assistant Surgeon and found to be satisfactory. The people prefer vaccination to inoculation, which is however practised in the interior. No inoculator was trained, but this obstinacy must surrender, or end, in inoculators being driven by public opinion from the field to which they so tenaciously cling. Small-pox broke out in several villages, but was stamped out by the vaccinator. ORISSA DIVISION. Cuttack Ungool Inspection.

M. COATES, M.D , Sanitary Commissioner for Bengal. W. H. D'C.MEDICAL. CALCUTTA, THE 12TH JANUARY 1877. RESOLUTION. READ( 2 ) Pergunnahs in the face of much difficulty, as little more than half the number of the vaccinators required could be obtained. In the Darjeeling and Eastern Bengal Circles also difficulty was experienced in keeping the establishments up to the sanctioned strength. 5. With the exception of the results in the Ranchee Circle, the high character of the work performed in the different circles, as established in previous years, was fully maintained. The general ratio per cent. of successful cases in primary vaccination was 97.2 per cent. against 96.53 in 1874-75, and 96.18 in 1873-74. In the Calcutta, Eastern Bengal, and Metropolitan Circles the ratio was over 99 per cent. Opportunity has been frequently taken of testing these figures with the result of establishing their accuracy. There is always a difficulty, however, in regard to figures relating to dispensary vaccination. They are not probably altogether trustworthy; still, so far as opportunities have been taken of testing the character of the work done, the results have not been unfavourable, and the greater attention which the matter is now receiving will eventually, it is hoped, result in greater accuracy in the returns. 6. Judged by the number of operations performed by each vaccinator on an average, there seems to have been an improvement in the efficiency of the establishments employed in all the circles, the Eastern Bengal and Ranchee Circles excepted. In the Ranchee Circle the falling off has been as marked as the improvement in the Sonthal Pergunnahs. For the former result the Superintendent, Surgeon J. Wood, is responsible. The Lieutenant-Governor gathers from the report that no sufficient nor satisfactory explanation has been given by the Superintendent of his failure, and that he is not free from blame in the matter. In the Sonthal Pergunnahs the Native Deputy Superin- tendent deserves great credit for the results achieved under unfavourable circumstances. 7. Of the whole number of persons recorded to have been vaccinated during the year, details as to caste, sex, and age have not been noted in respect of about one-fourth. Of the remaining three-fourths, it is reported that 4.75 per cent. were females against 52.5 per cent. males; 54.16 per cent. Hindoos against 42.06 per cent. Mussulmans; and 7 per cent. under one year of age against 93 per cent. over one year. Comparing these with the corresponding results for 1874-75, there has been a slight improvement in the proportion of females vaccinated, and a slight falling off in infant vaccination. The figures disclose no change worthy of remark in the proportion of people belonging to the different castes who have submitted to vaccination; but from several passages in the report, it is to be gathered that there has been less difficulty than heretofore in persuading the people to adopt vaccination, and that the prejudice in favor of inoculation is gradually passing away. Government ... 74,7 429 Municipal ... 59,469 Local Funds ... 3,000 Native States ... 1,425 Dispensaries ... 8,438 Ex-inoculators ... 168,567 8. In table C appended to his report, the Surgeon-General gives the number of persons, as abstracted in the margin, who were operated upon by vaccinators paid by Government, by Municipalities, and from Local Funds, &c. It is true that we have not yet any complete returns showing the amount of work done by private practitioners; still it is evident that a very undue share of the cost of vaccination continues to fall on Government. The comparatively small number of operations performed by municipal vacci- nators, and the smallness of the sums devoted by municipalities to their support, has lately attracted the special attention of Government, and separate instructions on the subject have been issued to district officers. The Lieutenant- Governor cannot but view with dissatisfaction the small number of operations performed by dispensary vaccinators. It is the duty of every medical officer in charge of a dispensary to promote vaccination, and the apparent general neglect of this part of their duty should engage the attention of the Surgeon- General. 9. The aggregate cost of vaccination during the past year, as shown in the report, was Rs. 1,05,800, of which Government contributed Rs. 96,629, the
( 3 ) balance being defrayed by municipalities and from local sources. In the pre- vious year the corresponding figures were Rs. 92,413 contributed by the State out of a total expenditure of Rs. 1,02,069. It therefore appears that the local contributions amounted to Rs. 9,171 only in the past year, against Rs. 9,656 in the previous year. This result is not satisfactory. An increase of Rs. 3,731 in the total expenditure falling upon the Government, is attributable to the open- ing of the two new circles above referred to. 10. The average cost of each successful case of vaccination during the past year was one anna ten pies, or precisely the same as in the previous year. In the Darjeeling, Metropolitan, and Eastern Bengal Circles, however, there was a sensible reduction in the average cost, while in the Ranchee Circle the cost was nearly double that of the previous year. 11. In reviewing in detail the progress of vaccination in the different circles of superintendence, the Surgeon-General remarks that in Calcutta and its Suburbs the character of the work done remained as high as ever; that Dr. Charles continued to apply himself with his usual devotion to his work; and that he and his establishment have achieved a splendid success. In the Metropolitan Circles operations were chiefly carried on in the Jessore district. The system pursued, as described, being &quot; continuous systematic progress by gangs under close inspec- tion, and the exhaustive protection of definite areas radiating from a centre.&quot; The proceedings have therefore been entirely in accordance with the orders of Government on the subject, which prescribe the concentration of operations. The results are said to have been very satisfactory and exceedingly creditable to Dr. Gupta and his assistants Rai Jadub Chunder Ghose Bahadoor, Rai Ramsoonder Ghose Bahadoor, and Buddy Nath Brummo. A similarly favour- able report is given of the work done in the Darjeeling Circle. There, it is said, &quot; the old desultory plan of scattering small gangs of vaccinators in several districts has been abandoned, and operations were concentrated in the district of Bogra, and the conterminous thanas of the surrounding districts.&quot; Much credit is also said to be due to Dr. Lidderdale for the energy and thoroughness with which he applies himself to his duties, and for the decided success he has secured in the face of much difficulty. In the Eastern Bengal Circle opera- tions were concentrated in the district of Furreedpore. There was some falling off in the amount of work done, but this is explained satisfactorily. In the Sonthal Pergunnahs operations were confined to the sub-divisions of Rajmehal and Godda. The frequency of outbreaks of small-pox in various parts of the pergunnahs is, however, said to have interfered much with systematic vaccina- tion. In the Ranchee Circle operations were commenced late. The plan of operations seems to have been ill-devised, and the results obtained have been anything but satisfactory. 12. As it is not intended that the circle establishments should be a permanent burden on the resources of the State, the importance of training up men who shall eventually enter upon independent practice as vaccinators has been frequently pressed upon the attention of all medical officers. In the Resolution on the report for 1874-75, the Lieutenant-Governor reviewed what had been done with the object of inducing inoculators to take to vaccination. In furtherance of the instructions which it was then noted had been issued on the subject, a grant of Rs. 6,000 was made from the savings in the budget of the year, with a view chiefly to provide a staff of inspectors who should control the working of ex-inoculators, to maintain a certain number of apprentices while under tuition, and to admit of rewards being given to those practitioners who showed a good outturn of work. The result of these measures has been separately reported by the Surgeon-General. The Lieutenant-Governor wishes, however, that in future a section of the annual report may be devoted to the subject, in order that its importance may not be lost sight of. 13. The results of the experiment are reported to have been as follows in the districts in which it was tried. In Midnapore three inspecting vaccinators were entertained, and twenty-six apprentices were placed under
( 4 ) training. 39,045 persons were vaccinated, and at the close of the year ten of the apprentices were discharged with certificates of qualification to practise. In Bankoora five inspecting and head vaccinators were entertained, who supervised the operations of seventy-four ex-inoculators already at work in this district. In all 37,435 persons were vaccinated, and a very large proportion of the cases were successful. In Manbhoom, similarly, seventy-five ex-inoculators were at work under inspection and vaccinated 26,872 persons; the percentage of success- ful cases was not, however, so good as in Bankoora. In Singbhoom fourteen ex-inoculators vaccinated 2,235 persons. In the Sonthal Pergunnahs two apprentices were trained, and seventy-five ex-inoculators vaccinated 57,722 persons. In the Bhagulpore district three ex-inoculators vaccinated 3,973 persons. In Monghyr ten apprentices were placed under training, five of whom finally obtained certificates of competency. One hundred and ninety ex-inoculators are also said to have been employed, who vaccinated 21,063 persons. In Chumparun forty-nine ex-inoculators vaccinated 2,123 children. These results are encouraging. It is unfortunately clear, however, that all the civil surgeons con- cerned have not taken the same amount of interest in the matter. Bhagulpore, situated between the Sonthal Pergunnahs and Monghyr (where the scheme, ably and intelligently worked, has met with signal success), is conspicuous for comparative failure. That the civil surgeon is not blameless in the matter is apparent from the fact that he does not appear to have put any apprentices under training. The same remark applies to the Civil Surgeon of Singbhoom, where the percentage of successful cases was unusually small. In Midnapore and Bankoora the success attained is in consonance with the results achieved in previous years by civil surgeons who have exhibited a real interest in their work. 14. Briefly stated, the result of the experiment was this, that in eight districts no less than 178,032 persons were successfully vaccinated at an aggregate cost to Government of Rs. 3,311 only, or on the average at a cost of just one quarter of an anna per case. As noted above, these results do not at all repre- sent what might have been achieved had all the officers worked with equal zeal and interest. 15. The conclusion to which the Lieutenant-Governor has arrived on the whole question is that the time has now arrived when he must make it distinctly understood that where districts have been once gone over and thoroughly protected by the circle establishments, the civil surgeons of districts must be held responsible for organizing establishments of independent practi- tioners with a view to maintain vaccination in the protected areas. There are many districts, chiefly those in the neighbourhood of the metropolis, where there can be no excuse for not now making vaccination self-supporting. Inoculation has been prohibited, and the people are said to be willing to receive vaccination. The Lieutenant-Governor therefore requests that the Surgeon- General will report which districts he would now recommend should be formally withdrawn from the vaccination circles and made over to the exclusive care of the civil surgeons. There are other districts also where, although the ground has not yet been gone over by circle vaccinators, it is plain that, by energy and perseverance, much might be done by the civil surgeons. Pubna is among this number. 16. It is noticeable that frequent complaints appear to have been made of the character of the lymph supplied. It is not stated where this was pro- cured in every case, but generally it would seem to have been sent from Calcutta. It is absolutely necessary that every possible care should be taken that all establishments in the mofussil are supplied with an ample stock of lymph, and that this should be of undoubtedly good quality. The Lieutenant-Governor wishes to be informed in future what measures have been taken with a view to maintain a proper supply of lymph, and in particular as to whether satisfactory arrangements could not be made for supplying all other districts from Darjeeling.

REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE PROVINCE OF BENGAL FOR 1878-79. BY JAMES IRVING, M.D., Officiating Surgeon-General for Bengal. Calcutta: PRINTED AT THE BENGAL SECRETARIAT PRESS. 1879.
No.1032/A B.G. FROM THE SURGEON-GENERAL FOR BENGAL, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL, JUDICIAL, POLITICAL, AND APPOINTMENT DEPARTMENTS. Dated Calcutta, the 6th September 1879. SIR, IN submitting the report on Vaccination in Bengal for the year commencing 1st April 1878 and terminating 31st March 1879, I have the honor to state that during that period Surgeon-Major T. E. Charles, M.D., was Superintendent-General of Vaccination, Calcutta and suburbs, and Surgeon- Major R. Lidderdale, M.D., Superintendent of the Darjeeling Circle. Surgeon J. J. Wood, M.B., was Superintendent of the Ranchee Circle from 1st April to the 22nd July 1878, when, having been appointed to act as Civil Surgeon of Hazaribagh in room of Dr. E. A. Birch, who was proceeding to England on sick leave, Surgeon D. Basu relieved him, and continued to officiate as Superintendent during the remainder of the year. The Metropolitan Circles were superintended during the entire year by Surgeon K. P. Gupta, M.B. The Eastern Bengal Circle was under Apothecary A. Lyons; the Behar Circle under Assistant Surgeon Kali Dass Bose as Superintendent; the Sonthal Per- gunnahs under Deputy Superintendent Mothoora Nath Sen; and the Orissa Circle under Assistant Surgeon Prisitosh Haldar. 2.

I. must refer to the reports of Superintendents which follow for details as to the working of the different circles. I have merely a few remarks to make in reference to these reports. Dr. Charles has sent a full report on the small-pox epidemic which has prevailed in Calcutta during the past year. That small-pox should so extensively prevail in Calcutta is of course an indication of a want of sufficient vaccination, but whether this is owing to any deficiency in the Presidency Vaccine Department I have not the means of ascertaining. It must also be fully admitted that probably Calcutta, from its position and from the large numbers of strangers in the shape of emigrants, pilgrims, and people in search of work who flock to it, can never be properly protected till such people believe more fully in vaccination than they do at present. Dr. Charles gives details of the extraordinary arrangements which he made for the protection of the population in May 1879, when he employed the staff of the Metropolitan Circles for that purpose. I find that each of the 20 extra vaccinators thus utilized vaccinated on an average 2.42 cases daily during the 60 days they worked in the town. In fact, the proportion was rather less, for I have calculated as if all the vaccinators commenced work on the 23 rd May, whereas some had started before that date. This result of vaccination practised during the prevalence of an epidemic of small-pox does not seem to indicate any great amount of zeal on the part of the extra establishment. 14. Compulsory vaccination.6 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BENGAL 16. To the same effect is a table below relative to temperature, rainfall, and small-pox in Rungpore, a district of Bengal, and it certainly does not seem to bear out the idea that a temperature of 85° enfeebles the diffusive power of small-pox:FOR THE YEAR 1878-79. 7 Circle the paid and licensed vaccinators worked close together, in order to secure the proper amount of the supervision as the staff of inspecting vaccinators was not sufficient for requirements. This is anything but a desirable practice, and it seems to me that paid and licensed vaccinators should work entirely separate and should be superintended by a separate staff. In fact, the proper plan is first of all thoroughly to protect a part of the country by means of circle operators and then permit the licensed vaccinators to carry on all future opera- tions. Nothing should be so steadily kept in view as this, that licensed vaccina- tors or ex-inoculators are a source of danger and difficulty, unless their work is very closely supervised seeing that they are very apt to revert to inoculation under such circumstances, it being much more easily carried on. I doubt if the supervision of paid vaccination has been sufficient in any of the circles; and beg to call attention to what Dr. Lawrie has written of the mode in which some 298 ex-inoculators in the Monghyr district carried on inoculation under cloak of being vaccinators working under a Government license. It will further be observed that in the Chumparun district six ex-inoculators refused to work as vaccinators according to the English method, saying that they preferred being independent. It was found that they practised inoculation instead of vacci- nation. Small-pox has been very prevalent in that district since, and vaccinators had to be deputed to it from Patna in consequence. 20. Small-pox after inoculation.8 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BENGAL THE Report of the Presidency Circle by Dr. Charles, Superintendent-General of Vac- cination, was received in this office on the 11th June. Surgeon-Major R. Harvey acted from the 13th August to the 17th November, and during the rest of the year Dr. Charles. There were no changes in the permanent staff. In August an extra vaccinator was employed; in February four, and in March two, extra vaccinators were taken on in conse- quence of the severities of the small-pox epidemic. Dr. Charles would have employed more men had properly trained vaccinators been available.

Prevalence in May and June 1878.10 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BENGAL by means of inoculation. This took place many years ago, and two of the persons thus inoculated elsewhere, after the practice was illegal in Calcutta, came under the care of Baboo Callachund Dey. Both of these persons have had small-pox this year, and the belief in the superior protection afforded by inoculation has been cruelly shaken in the minds of all those acquainted with the special pains taken to insure protection to these two individuals. &quot; In connection with these two instances of small-pox attacking after previous inoculation, I may state as another incident that many examples have this year been brought to my notice not only of inoculated persons having been attacked, but of many deaths having taken place among such previously protected persons. I myself have been familiar with such occurrences since 1864, but I have a very decided impression on my mind that during this epidemic more inoculated persons have died in proportion to those attacked than I have ever previously seen. Be this as it may, of another fact there can be no doubt, that the number of medical men who have this year voluntarily told me of instances of small-pox taking place in those protected by inoculation has exceeded in great measure the numbers who used previously to tell me of the same occurrences. Not only was such information not often voluntarily conveyed to me, but on my raising the question all the medical men educated at the Medical College quietly expressed their belief in the superior protective efficacy of inoculation; they either did not know of or had overlooked the fact that large numbers of people who have been inoculated in childhood, during every epidemic of small- pox, get the disease, not a few dying from it. Two factors seem to have acted in fostering a belief among them of the superior protection effected by inoculation. The one was that they inherited a belief in the absolute protection afforded by inoculation as hundreds of medical men in Europe have inherited a belief likewise false, that one attack of small-pox affords absolute protection from another. The other depended on their having seen or heard of persons having undergone an operation at the hands of a vaccinator, which had been improperly represented as a protective vaccination. The large amount of unsupervised vaccination conducted in India only gave them too frequent opportunities of hearing of small-pox seizing on those imperfectly vaccinated. For many years vaccination has been most carefully supervised in Calcutta, such cases as above alluded to can only now take place purely exceptionally, and when the protection given by vaccination has worn out and small- pox seizes on such persons before the protection has been renewed by re-vaccination, the nature of the occurrence is estimated at its true value.&quot; Dr. Charles is of opinion from what he has heard and been told that among educated Bengalis in Calcutta, faith in vaccination as a prophylactic has of late greatly increased, and goes so far as to express his belief that were inoculation now permitted in Calcutta, &quot; not a dozen households among the upper and middle classes would allow an inoculator to practise his calling among them.&quot; The experience of the epidemic has shown in a wavering manner the efficacy of small-pox, as in an example such as the following, where one or two unpro- tected individuals are living among a number of vaccinated persons, and where the former are attacked by the disease and the latter entirely escaped. In Calcutta there is virus from two distinct sources which are kept up entirely apart and in different parts of the town. The one is from Jenner's lymph which has been humanised for over 80 years, and the other is some which Dr. Charles humanised in 1871, and he found during the epidemic of small-pox that the protection by means of the old was just as good as that afforded by the new lymph. Dr. Charles favours the idea that vaccination should be made compulsory in Calcutta, though he is given to understand that Government is opposed to a law compelling it. He dwells on the fact that in Calcutta during the epidemic of last year, 1,923 persons died, and the disease was still going on when he wrote. He thinks that such a terrible death-rate calls for special action of some sort, seeing that, though the vaccination department works vigorously, small-pox still prevails in Calcutta. Allusion is made to a report which he wrote in 1868 on the stamping out of small-pox in Calcutta in which he showed how necessary it was that the department should have immediate notice when a case of small- pox occurred in order that by means of vaccination a zone should be formed round the infected house and thus prevent the patient becoming a focus of contagion. Dr. Charles thus concludes his reportFOR THE YEAR 1878-79. 11 instances as examples of such satisfactory working. This fact has been proved to demon- stration and admits of no denial. I am so impressed with the necessity for such a step to be taken, and so much afraid that the point may be passed by unnoticed by the Government through inadvertence, that I trust I may not be deemed unnecessarily urgent when I ven- ture to solicit a distinct intimation from the Government that this suggestion has met with the consideration for which I crave.&quot; &quot; Besides this point, while asking for a reconsideration of my report on the stamping out of small-pox as a whole, I would also beg for particular attention being given to section VII, page 14, in which I direct attention to the obvious necessity that exists for the destruction of bedding, clothing, and other articles saturated with small-pox poison, and take up kindred points in relation to the spread of small-pox by other carriers of contagion. At present not a vestige of restraint on such matters is insisted upon, and the loss of life caused by the absence of these restrictions may be justly styled as appalling.&quot; I had requested that the Annual Reports of Superintendents might be short, and Dr. Charles, whose report extends to 59 pages, has in several passages alluded to this restriction as hampering him in writing. I have therefore informed him that I shall be prepared to submit to Government a report of any length he choses, in order that his views may be fully expanded as to the recent epidemic of small-pox in Calcutta. The following is an abstract of the Eleventh Annual Report of the Metropolitan Circles for the year ending 31st March 1879, which was received in my office on the 16th May. Budget allotment.12 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BENGAL Successful operations.FOR THE YEAR 1878-79. 13 To make this check really effective, Mr. Gupta is of opinion that the police should be empowered to call upon all working vaccinators to produce their licenses, and convince them- selves as to their genuineness, they being furnished with copies of the same from the office of the Superintendent of Vaccination. Something also should be done to prevent ex-ino- culators cheating the people with spurious vaccination. This takes place in the hot and rainy seasons when the regular trained men retire. The practice of small-pox inoculation though rendered penal by law, was practised very largely in parts of Nuddea, Jessore, and Midnapore. The Magistrate and police do not apparently enforce the law as they should do. Reports against the practice were made to some of the District Magistrates, but hitherto no notice has been taken. The Act prohi- biting inoculation, Mr. Gupta further thinks, should be enlarged and amended so as to include offences which are not now punishable. Small-pox.14 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BENGAL Conduct and work of establishment.FOR THE YEAR 1878-79. 15 &quot; The presence of cholera during the whole cold weather interfered with operations in many places. It was generally distributed, of a severe type, and many deaths occurred ; fever, of course, gave much trouble. &quot; Several of the thanas taken up had already been visited by men sent out from dis- pensaries, and by others, stealing instruments and lymph and taking the name of Government vacinators. Some were deserters or men dismissed from Government service. Their opera- tions were almost uniformly bad, showing a very imperfect cicatrix and a deficient number of vesicles. As these men had been ordered about and had been obliged to work only when it suited the villagers, the same system of treatment was adopted towards Government vacccinators desiring to progress steadily on from village to village leaving nobody unpro- tected behind, the constant disputes which arose, and delays which were brought about show how very undesirable it is even to carry on vaccine operations in any country except on a regular understood system and under proper supervision. The work of these men caused a large diminution of operations, as from being in a few villages here and there good work- ing stocks of lymph were always being reduced to a low ebb on the Government men arriving at such semi-protected villages. &quot; The number of persons vaccinated, 170, 986, is in excess of that of the season before by 5,551 ; but more would easily have been done but for the reason above given. Each vaccinator operated on an average of 3288.19 persons, of whom 99 per cent. were success- fully done according to the annual report, 98.66 by my inspection of 32,389 persons, and 97.88 by the Deputy Suprintendent's inspection of 34,215. &quot; The success in secondary vaccination of 183 persons was 85.39 per cent. Each successful case cost the Government 2 annas and 4 pie. &quot;The number of villages protected was 3,098, of which 2,948, were in Rnngpore, 128 in Dinagepore, 20 in Maldah, and 2 in Purneah. The villages vaccinated in Maldah and Purneah were done to suppress small-pox, and not in the course of systematic operations.

It has not become epidemic in any instance. &quot; Attitude of the people towards vaccination.FOR THE YEAR 1878-79. 17 deaths in January 1879 swelled to 2,001 cases with 391 deaths in March. Altogether there were 3,190 cases with 536 deaths reported by the police during the year under review in the Rungpore district, which represents much unnecessary suffering and loss of life. These numbers, 1 am satisfied, are less than should have been returned, one Native Superintendent finding many cases where the police reported only 18. In all districts of the circle 604 deaths were reported, of which 14 occurred in Dinagepore. There were no cases in Bogra or Rajshaye ; those reported in the former district turning out to be chicken- pox. Out of the protected area of the Darjeeling Circle, consisting of Bogra, Rajshahye, and Dinagepore, no case occurred in the first two, and only the above-mentioned insignificant number in the last, and only in consequence of a village having been imperfectly protected when there was a change of Native Superintendents. The population of this area was given in 1872 as upwards of three millions and a half. &quot; I think the results above indicated are a complete vindication of the concentrated system of working vaccination. &quot; Supplies of Lymph were distributed to stations in Northern Bengal as required by Civil Surgeons. &quot; I would, in conclusion, desire to state that I have made this report as short as possi- ble, merely touching in the different paragraphs on a few points on which it appeared desirable to record information and not entering into particulars similar to those of former years. &quot; Vaccination has made a distinct advance during the season, and through the area covered may look small in the map of Bengal, yet the amount of opposition overcome has been enormous and a part of the country fairly protected which was before a great centre of small-pox infection.&quot; Dr. Lidderdale reports as to vaccination performed by licensed vaccinators in the Darjeeling Circle as follows: &quot; The establishment was increased during the year by the extension of the system of appointing license vaccinators to the whole district of Dinage- pore, giving an additional strength of twenty-one men. Assistant Surgeon, Narandra Nath Goopta, was appointed as Deputy Superintendent in Bengal Government's letter No. 3218 of 14th September 1878. The establishment now stands as under, viz. 1 Deputy Superintendent, 3 Inspectors, and 90 licensed vaccinators. There was some fluctuation in strength during the working season on account of sickness, and some of the new men appointed in Dinagepore found the country so well protected the year before by the Government establishment that they failed comfortably to make a livelihood and retired. The population of the district being scanty, the necessary supply of vaccinfers was obtained with difficulty from the people not allowing newborn infants to be taken from village to village. The Deputy Superintendent had only a few months' experience in this department before and was not thoroughly acquainted with his duties. He is not a suffi- ciently active man for the work, and has not that interest in its success necessary to influence his subordinates to much exertion. The Inspector in Rajshahye is not trustworthy; but the general conduct of the other two Inspectors and of most of the men was satisfactory. As it is proposed to extend the system to the greater part of Rungpore next season, the services of another Inspector will be required. 4. Number of operations, their success, &c.18 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BENGAL Small-pox was almost entirely absent from the above area during the year. The cases reported from Bogra were chicken-pox, and none were reported from Rajshaye, although later information shows that one case was introduced from a ship coming from Mecca to Calcutta from which the passengers seem to have been landed without any examination or quarantine. Three cases occurred in thana Mohung in Rungpore, but the disease did not spread. Fourteen deaths were noted in one imperfectly protected village in Dinagepore. This was certainly a satisfactory state of matters in such an extensive area, liable to have small-pox brought into it, from all sides, and gives promise that, working the Government establishment to extend the area and afterwards appointing licensed vaccinators, a large part of Bengal, formerly much afflicted by small-pox, will remain for long periods almost exempt from it. I did not hear of any one practising inoculation where it was forbidden by law. 6. Considering the many difficulties connected with the experiment of trying a self- supporting system of vaccinaton under Government supervision, I think it may be received that it has been fairly successful. The expenditure has been insignificant compared with the results obtained. The addition of the operations of the licensed vaccinators to those of the Government men overtakes the birth-rate of the whole circle. Under orders conveyed in Government letter No. 2069, dated 7th May 1879, the fees to be taken by licensed vaccinators are fixed at two annas. This will I fear induce a good many men to throw up their appointments as they took them up on the understanding that the fees sanctioned by Government were four annas for a boy and two for a girl. A change to a lower rate is, I think, unfortunate after the matter had once before been considered and decided.&quot; CIRCLE VACCINATION. Ranchee.FOR THE YEAR 1878-79 19 worked in the south-west portions of Manbhoom district in thanas Jeypore, Jhulda, Bagmoondee, Patkoom, and a portion of Purulia. Great opposition was encountered from the zemindar of Jeypore, where all attempts to introduce vaccination had failed in previous years as in 1870-71, 1871-72. Ex-inoculators had also tried but failed, but in December last the resistance was overcome and the town of Jeypore itself furnished 575 cases. The people of Nagda also opposed the vaccinators, and it is most probable that, but for the assistance of the district officers, all efforts to introduce the prophylactic would have failed as signally in 1878-79 as in previous years. The number of operations performed by the party was 23,727, of which 22,991 were successful, or 93.25 per cent. The number of villages protected was 505. Dr. Basu speaks highly of the exertions of the inspecting vaccinator and of the men under him. It is said that one vaccinator, Mahomed Mustapha Khan, did 4,236 cases, of which 3,993 were successful. None of this party were reported for taking pice. They were inspected twice in November and twice in December by the Deputy Superintendent, thrice in January, twice in February, and thrice in March by Dr. Basu, and twice in March by the Deputy Superintendent.

The temporary establishment was retained from the 15th October 1878, leaving the post of one inspector and six vaccinators unoccupied for want of competent men to fill up. Of the permanent staff, one vaccinator being taken up seriously ill took leave for a month in October and did not return.

Four inoculators in the Pubna district were prosecuted under Act IV (B.C.) of 186524 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BENGAL they deem it superior to inoculation as that it is the Sarkar's hukum and a passive desire to evince loyalty to that hukum. I have, however, no doubt but that in time they will learn to know and appreciate its benefits, and of course to pay for it as they previously did for inoculation. The license vaccinators on the whole behaved fairly well and rendered their returns tolerably punctually, though inaccurately, which necessitated repeated returns for correc- tion. ORISSA CIRCLE. The fourth annual report of the Orissa Circle of vaccination reached my office on the 17th June. It is written by the Deputy Superintendent, Assistant Surgeon Prisitosh Holdar, and is forwarded through the Civil Surgeon, Magistrate, and Commissioner. Vaccination was not properly established till the end of October, when it was effected by means of English lymph, three supplies which were previously received in September and October from Calcutta having failed. The 30 vaccinators were divided into three parties of ten under a head vaccinator. One party worked in the sub-division of Kendrapara, another in Bhudrak, and the third in thanas Jogutsingpore and Sirlot. These vacci- nators protected 847 villages and performed 34,619 operations, against 36,375 the previous year. The successful cases numbered 33,731, or 97.71 per cent. against 34,748, or 97.87, in 1877-78. The decrease is accounted for by the lateness in commencing operations and the sickness of the vaccinators. Each man, however, on an average operated on 1,153.73 cases. The cost of each successful case was two annas and nine pie. The character of the vaccination is stated to have been high class. The superintendent inspected 210 villages and examined 17,519 cases, which gave a success of 99.43 per cent. The party which worked at Kendrapara has done 220 villages, performed 10,036 operations with a success of 99.16 per cent. The second party did nearly the whole of the outpost of Bonto and the greater part of Agurpara in Bhudrak, but the details of number are not given in the report. The third party visited 236 villages and performed 9,512 operations, of which 9,384, or 98.72 per cent., were successful. &quot; No pains were spared to work in a thorough and systematic manner and protect village after village. But, notwithstanding all our efforts, portions of some villages had to be left unprotected owing to the ignorant opposition of the people.&quot; The Assistant Surgeon records that the practice of vaccination in Orissa during the past four years has served to overcome much of prejudice and opposition that at first was expe- rienced. It is now admitted by them who have received its benefits that it is free from the dangers which result from the practice of inoculation, though some continue to doubt the protective power of vaccination. It is added that persons of the higher castes still favour inoculation. The lower classes and Mussulmans are less prejudiced, it is said, than those before mentioned. Assistant-Surgeon Prisitosh Holdar dwells on the difficulties experienced in carrying out vaccination. By means of persuasion, however, strong opposition and prejudices were after a time overcome, and he proceeds thusFOR THE YEAR 1878-79. 25 licenses. I agree with Dr. Stewart in thinking that it is very desirable to prevent inocula- tion, but at the same time I doubt if the people of any part of Orissa are yet prepared for this measure. They have been long used to inoculation, and vaccination has only been tried for not quite four years, and against the latter they entertain strong prejudices. Let them see more of vaccination, and Act IV (B.C.) of 1865 may be introduced easily and with advantage. This is the view taken by the Commissioner and the Magistrate. I can see no advantage in having the post of licensed vaccinators hereditary, nor why the rules that are followed in other circles should not be equally applicable to Orissa where vaccination is carried on in connection with Act IV of 1865. In the meantime, I have no doubt that the Civil Surgeon and district officers could do a great deal in inducing inoculators to learn and practise vaccination, working along with the circle vaccinators as in other circles. Assistant Surgeon Kally Dass Bose, who was Superintendent of the Behar Circle during the year, reports as in the following abstract. His report was received on the 28th May.

The vaccinator paid by the Serampore municipality confines his operations within municipal limits, which include the towns of Chatra, Bullabpore, Mohesh, Rishra, and Connaghur. There were 891 cases of primary vaccinations, of which 883 were successful, as also were 21 re-vaccinations. The people in general are favourably disposed towards vaccination and the educated classes seek it; but there is a large number of Brahmins and Mahomedans who will not consent to themselves or their children being protected. Among these, occurred cases of small- pox in a sporadic form. The largest number of cases affected with this disease occurred within the jurisdiction of Biddabatty outpost, where 14 cases with 6 deaths were reported in the months of March and April. Inoculation is not carried on, nor were inoculators trained to practise vaccination in this sub-division. PRESIDENCY DIVISION. 24-Pergunnahs.30 ABSTRACT OF REPORTS BY CIVIL SURGEONS. It seems that the introduction of Act IV (B.C.) of 1865 into this district has checked the practice of inoculation. Six ex-inoculators were trained and deputed to the interior, with instructions to keep registers of the cases performed and to submit fortnightly returns through the officers in charge of the thanas in the jurisdiction of which they worked. One only of the six furnished the returns and came back at the termination of the season with his registers of cases. Of the remaining five nothing has been seen or heard of since. They not only completely disregarded all instructions about the submission of returns, &c., but had not the honesty to return the vaccine lancets which were lent to them. RAJSHAHYE DIVISION.

The city was divided into three parts with two vaccinators to each, but no attempt was made to vaccinate any one part thoroughly. They performed 1,993 primary and 14 re-vaccinations, with 1,866 and 12 successful cases respectively, the work being inspected by Dr. Crombie, the Civil Surgeon The Maniokgunge vaccinator, being assisted by the police, visited every house within the limits of the union and performed 389 operations, of which 324 were successful, and Civil Hospital Assistant Dr. Shosheebhusan Guha, inspecting his work, states that they were properly done and the results in most cases satisfactory. The attitude of the people was the same as in former years, but the resistance was not so active ; they do not consider it more effectual than inoculation, which is still practised in some parts of the district. The villagers of some thanas, however, sent several applications for vaccinators, which were forwarded to the Superintendent of Vaccination, Eastern Bengal Circle, as Dr. Crombie could not meet the demands on account of the insufficient number of men under him. No means were taken to train inoculators. No epidemic of small-pox occurred during the year, but some cases were reported. In the town of Dacca 68 deaths were registered. The number of deaths in the whole district from these disease was 172. Furrcedpore. ABSTRACT OF REPORTS BY CIVIL SURGEONS. 33 sanctioned by Government every year for vaccinating in the interior. With such a small staff the locality protected year by year was necessarily very small and the number of operations very few. There were 1,037 vaccinations, all primary, of which 851 were success- ful, 179 unsuccessful or doubtful, and 7 unknown. Dr. Murray states that a great many cases failed on account of the inefficiency of his staff, the bad lymph supplied from Calcutta, and the resistance of the people, who are bitterly opposed to vaccination as &quot; inoculation is par excellence the favourite mode of protection with the Chittagongian.&quot; Dr. Murray also strongly recommends the introduction of Act IV (B.C.) of 1865 within the Chittagong muni- cipality. Severe epidemics of small-pox are rare, and the petty outbreaks that do occur have in the majority of instances been traced to the activity of the inoculators, none of whom were trained during the year under report. There was little or no small-pox in the district, and no deaths from it occurred in the town of Chittagong for the first time on record. There were altogether 69 deaths in the district, a large proportion of which occurred during a petty local outbreak in the extreme south at the close of the calendar year. The disease was bad in Cox's Bazar during March. Noakholly.34 ABSTRACT OF REPORTS BY CIVIL SURGEONS. three were temporarily entertained from November to 31st March. The numbers vaccinated are recorded as 1,778, against 1,223 in the previous year. The attitude of the people as regards vaccination is reported as friendly, though a certain class are hostile to its introduc- tion. There were no trained inoculators employed during the year.

The Civil Surgeon frequently inspected the cases in Durbhunga and also in the sub-divisions when he visited them. There were 3,967 successful cases out of a total of 4,024 operations, the total of the year previous being 24,128. This considerable falling off is attributed by Dr. Bovill, the Civil Surgeon, to the want of funds to pay vaccinators and inspectors, the late commencement of the vaccine season, and to his being near to the district. The people in general are favorably disposed towards vaccination, but in some parts of the district the practice of inoculation is very prevalent. Eighty-nine persons out of 110 examined in the Modhubani sub-divisional school were inoculated. No epidemic of small-pox occurred. Sarun.36 ABSTRACT OF REPORTS BY CIVIL SURGEONS. on.

ROBERT HARVEY, M.B., Officiating Sanitary Commissioner for Bengal. The 14th July 1879. Reg. No. 6807RESOLUTION. MEDICAL. Calcutta, the 10th December 1879. READ( 2 ) all Government vaccinators attached to dispensaries having been dispensed with during the past year, and to the decrease in the number of ex-inocu- lators; but the falling-off was more than compensated for by the increase in the number of operations performed by other vaccinators. 3. The total number of operations reported to have been successful in 1878-79 was 1,251,936, against 1,182,665 in 1877-78. Leaving out of con- sideration the operations of which the result was not known, the percentages of successful cases in primary vaccination in the two years were 98.29 and 98.04, respectively. Excluding dispensary vaccination, the reported results of which are not considered by the Surgeon-General to be trustworthy, the ratio of successful cases in primary vaccinations was 98.49 per cent. in the past year, against 97.81 per cent. in the year preceding. The proportion was higher in 1878-79 than in the previous year in all, excepting the Calcutta, Metro- politan, and Behar circles, and ranged from 99.68 per cent. in the Eastern Bengal circle to 93.56 per cent. in the Ranchee circle, where it has been the lowest for several years. In secondary vaccinations, the ratio of success was 46.89 per cent., against 72.06 per cent. in 1877-78. In dispensary vaccination, 94.97 per cent. of the primary, and 77.57 per cent. of the secondary operations are reported to have been successful in 1878-79, against 93.77 per cent. and 84.29 per cent., respectively, in 1877-78. 4. Of the persons vaccinated during the past year, the age was recorded of only 1,246,290, and of these 106,695, or 8.5 per cent., were under one year and the rest above that age. The sex was registered of 1,265,428 persons, of whom 53.81 per cent. were males, and 46.18 per cent. females. Of the 1,249,711 persons whose caste or religion was noted, 54.93 per cent. were Hindoos, 39.33 per cent. Mussulmans, .38 per cent. Christians, and 5.35 per cent. &quot;other castes.&quot; Compared with the results of 1877-78, the proportions of males and females were nearly the same, but there was a considerable increase in the proportion of Hindoos, and a corresponding decrease in that of Mussulmans. There was also a slight decrease in the proportion of infants under one year of age. 5. The total cost of vaccination during the past year was Rs. 1,17,988, against Rs. 1,23,140 in 1877-78 and Rs. 1,18,731 in 1876-77. The amount expended by Government was Rs. 1,05,517, against Rs. 1,09,577 in the previous year. The proportion of the expenditure derived from municipal and other local funds was Rs. 12,471, or only 10.5 per cent. of the total cost, against 11.01 per cent. in 1877-78. The average cost of each successful case was 1 anna and 6 pies, against 1 anna and 7 pies in the previous year. It varied from 7 annas and 6 pies in Behar to only 9 pies in the Eastern Bengal circle. In only one of the circles, viz. Behar, was the average cost higher than in 1877-78. It was lower in all the other circles, except Darjeeling and Orissa, in which it was the same as in the previous year. In dispensaries, it rose from 10 pies in 1877-78 to 1 anna and 1 pie in 1878-79. 6. The average number of operations performed by each circle vaccinator during the past year was 1,191, against 1,488 in 1877-78. In the Eastern Bengal, Darjeeling, and Sonthal Pergunnahs circles, there was a slight increase in 1878-79 in the amount of work done by each vaccinator, and in the Orissa and Ranchee circles a slight decrease. In the Behar circle the decrease was more than 22 per cent., and in the Calcutta circle more than 37 per cent. In the Metropolitan circle, in which the decrease was greatest, each vaccinator on an average did less than half the work per- formed in 1877-78, but this was due in a great measure to the introduction of the self-supporting system of vaccination. As in 1877-78 and 1876-77, the average number of operations was lowest in the Behar circle, and the out-turn of work in this circle since it came into existence has been so small, and so dispro- portionate to its cost, that the Commissioner of Patna recently recommended the abolition of the whole establishment. The opposition offered to vaccination here appears, however, to be greater than in other circles, and as in this matter the Beharis are less docile, and more obstinate than the Bengalis and Ooryas, a great deal of tact and energy is required. The Lieutenant-Governor has allowed the circle to remain for the present as it is, but if the results continue to be as unsatisfactory as they have been, it will be a question whether the present expensive establishment should not be done away with.
( 3 ) 7. The system of self-supporting vaccination under the supervision of officers attached to circles and paid by Government was worked on a very extensive scale during the past year. It was introduced throughout the Metropolitan circle, the largest circle of vaccination in Bengal, where it was only partially tried in 1877-78. The establishment of paid vaccin- ators and head-vaccinators attached to this circle was abolished from October 1878, and licensed vaccinators were substituted, who worked for their own benefit and without aid from Government. Instead of the 12 head- vaccinators, 102 vaccinators and 66 ex-inoculators employed in 1877-78, 294 licensed vaccinators worked during the past season, under the supervision of 24 Inspectors, four Deputy Superintendents, and one Superintendent. These vaccinators were authorized to charge a uniform fee of two annas for each successful operation. The total number of operations performed, the percentage of successful cases in primary vaccination, and the average cost of each successful case were 3,94,186, 99.37, and 1 anna 3 pies, respectively, against 457,757, 99.56, and 1 anna 4 pies, respectively, in 1877-78. The Lieutenant- Governor agrees with the Surgeon-General in thinking that the results obtained in this circle were satisfactory for the first season of the experiment. 8. In the Darjeeling circle 90 licensed vaccinators worked during the past year, against 69 in the year preceding. They were under the supervision of three Inspectors, and one Deputy Superintendent, and performed 88,871 operations, against 63,429 in 1877-78. Each successful case cost the Government for supervision five pies, while the cost of a successful operation performed by the paid staff was two annas and one pie. In the Ranchee circle 125 licensed vaccinators and ex-inoculators, under three Inspectors paid by Government and one Inspector paid by the Sirgoojah estate, operated on 87,492 persons, against 91,061 persons vaccinated by 128 ex-inoculators in 1877-78. The average cost of each successful operation in 1878-79 was 2( 4 ) previous year. The number of vaccinators employed in municipalities and dispensaries in 1878-79 was 159, against 192 in 1877-78, the decrease being due to the abolition of the staff of Government vaccinators attached to dispensaries. The total number of operations performed by these men and by medical subordinates attached to dispensaries was 122,822, of which 114,781 are reported to have been successful. The Lieutenant-Governor agrees with Dr. Irving that all vaccine operations carried on within a vaccin- ation circle should be entirely directed and superintended by officers of the Vaccination Department. Dr. Lawrie's report on the ex-inoculators in Monghyr is now the subject of a separate correspondence with the Surgeon- General. 9. Of the 394,186 operations in the Metropolitan circle, 291,745, or about 75 per cent., were verified by the Inspectors, while the Deputy Superin- tendents inspected 135,198, and the Superintendent 29,270 cases. In the Darjeeling circle more than one-third of the operations performed by the paid vaccinators were inspected by the Superintendent and his deputy. Nearly half the work turned out by both paid and licensed vaccinators in the Ranchee circle was examined. In the Sonthal Pergunnahs circle, out of 36,287 vaccinations performed by the paid establishment, 10,241 were verified by the Deputy Superintendent, and about the same number by the Inspectors ; while, out of 3,942 operations performed by the licensed vaccinators, 635 were inspected by the Deputy Superintendent and only 425 by the Inspectors. Very little work appears to have been done by the Inspectors in this circle. In the Eastern Bengal circle, out of 184,854 operations by the paid staff, 25,275 were verified by the Superintendent. More than 50 per cent. of the cases in the Orissa circle, and more than 78 per cent. of those in the Behar circle were examined by the Superintendents of the respective circles. On the whole, a fair amount of inspection work appears to have been performed during the year. 10. The epidemic of small-pox which visited Calcutta in 1877-78 continued with unabated severity during the early months of the past year. The registered number of deaths from the disease in April 1878 was 338, against 287 in the previous month. In May the number was 331, and in June 253. In July, August, and September the mortality diminished considerably, the total number of deaths in those months being 114. In the last quarter of the year there were 46 deaths, in January 63, in February 133, and in March 212. The epidemic thus extended over two years, a circumstance of very rare occurrence, there being in the office of the Superintendent-General of Vaccination only one other recorded instance, viz. the epidemic of 1849 and 1850, when 1,724 deaths occurred in the former year, and 4,492 in the latter. The contrast between the high figures of 1850 and the much lighter ones of 1879 is so far satisfactory that it points strongly to the increased pro- tection against small-pox afforded to the general population since 1850. Dr. Charles attributes the exceptional prevalence of small-pox in May and June 1878 to the coolness of the season, and expresses the opinion that the hot weather usually met with in those months &quot; desiccates and renders inert the contagion of small-pox and of all other contagious diseases.&quot; A tempera- ture of almost 70° F., he states, allows small-pox to spread with fatal freedom, a temperature of 80° checks its progress materially and decreases the death-rate, while a continuance of a temperature of 85° for two or three weeks even arrests the progress of the epidemic in a most peremptory manner. This view regarding the influence of temperature on the spread of small-pox is not, however, in accordance with the statistics of the disease in many parts of Northern India, nor does it appear to be borne out by the returns for Lower Bengal. In the mofussil, the recorded number of deaths from small-pox in 1878 was 12,410, against 8,088 in 1877 and 10,746 in 1876. 11. The question of introducing a measure to make vaccination compul- sory in Calcutta and in municipalities has been separately submitted to Govern- ment, and in connection with that subject the proposal for legislation in order to compel notice being given on the occurrence of a case of small-pox will receive consideration. Orders have already been passed that all candidates for admis- sion to the police force or as jail warders must be vaccinated, if they are not already protected against small-pox. The Lieutenant-Governor is awaiting a
( 5 ) report from the Committee on medical expenditure on the subject of vacci- nation. From the reports for the last few years Sir Ashley Eden is inclined to believe that the administration of the department is capable of much im- provement without any additional expenditure, but he is unwilling to introduce any radical change until he has had the advantage of learning the views of the Committee.

REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE PROVINCE OF BENGAL FOR 1879-80. BY A. J. PAYNE, M.D., Surgeon-General for Bengal. Calcutta: PRINTED AT THE BENGAL SECRETARIAT PRESS. 1880.
No. 3301 1/2. FROM THE SURGEON-GENERAL FOR BENGAL, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL, JUDICIAL, POLITICAL, AND APPOINTMENT DEPARTMENTS. Dated Calcutta, the 24th September 1880. SIR, IN submitting the report on vaccination in Bengal for the year 1879-80, I beg to say that the sole reason of its having been delayed beyond the prescribed date is that orders were received for the preparation of statis- tical tables in new forms at a period of the year too late to admit of the forms being sent to the officers of the department in time for current record of the additional points of information required. The forms were received in my office on the 9th February 1880, when the working season was approach- ing its end, and all that could be done in conformity with orders was to direct Superintendents of circles to give the new information that was required as completely as possible. 2. When the comparative decennial statements were obtained, the figures returned were found to differ materially from those given in former reports, and corrections and explanations occupied much time. Even now the figures of the decennial statement do not correspond with those of the former reports of this office. Some officers acknowledge omissions, and others excessive entries, in previous years; in some, re-vaccinations have been included in the figures of primary vaccinations, and in some the work of ex-inoculators was shown both by Civil Surgeons and Superintendents of circles, resulting in double entry. The past records of Civil Surgeons do not seem to be trustworthy. Dr. Jackson reports that his returns for certain dispensaries show more successful cases than the total number of operations. The manuscript returns exist in my office only from the year 1877-78, all earlier manuscripts having been destroyed, as I am told, in the office of the Surgeon-General, Indian Medical Department. The printed annual reports of the early years have therefore been used for comparison, but these, where they differ from the figures now returned, do not enable me to say which is correct. I have endeavoured to adjust discrepancies as far as possible by calling for explanations and otherwise, and it was not until the 23rd August that the last corrected return reached me. 3. During the year under report Surgeon-Major T. E. Charles was Superintendent-General of Vaccination in Calcutta and its suburbs. This office has been abolished under the new arrangements for compulsory vaccin- ation, which provide that vaccination in the town shall be controlled by the Health Officer, while the suburbs will become a part of the Metropolitan circle. Surgeon-Major R. Lidderdale continued to superintend the Darjeeling circle in 1879-80, and Surgeon K. P. Gupta held charge of the Metropolitan circle. Surgeon D. Basu controlled the Ranchi circle till 8th October 1879, when he was relieved by the return of Surgeon-Major Wood. Assistant Surgeon Kali Doss Bose officiated for Dr. Wood towards the close of the season. The Eastern Bengal circle was Superintended by Apothecary A. Lyons during the year. Assistant Surgeon Mathoranath Sen took charge of the Behar circle on 19th August 1879, and from 15th idem Assistant Surgeon P. C. Bose superintended the Sonthal Pergunnahs. The Orissa circle was under Assistant Surgeon Prisitosh Haldar.

I would refer to the remarks of the Deputy Superintendent and of Mr. Edgar, the Officiating Commissioner of the Patna Division, produced in the abstract. In the resolution of Government on the report for 1878-79, it was stated, with reference to the Behar circle, that &quot; if the results continue to be unsatisfactory as they have been, it will be a question whether the present expensive establishment should not be done away wilh.&quot; The total increase during the year was 509,225, and the total decrease 82,114, or a net increase of 427,111 cases. 6.

Dr. Charles' past reports have shown conclusively the high degree of success which attends vaccination in the hot weather and rains in Calcutta and its suburbs, when effort is stimulated by the presence of small- pox, and he has shown also how completely the supposed obstacles to contin- uous vaccination have been removed by ordinary care in operation. The periodic recurrence of epidemics, and more particularly the season of their commencement in Calcutta, prove the great mischief of leaving the town com- paratively unprotected during the hot weather and rains, and though vaccin- ation has been made compulsory here it may well be feared that it will be deprived of much of its power for good if it be not enforced without interruption throughout the year. There are districts whose population is so scanty, and where travelling is so difficult, that preserved lymph is used of necessity for transmission from place to place. This lymph does deteriorate from heat and moisture, and may suffer so greatly as to prevent vaccination in the hot weather and rains. Generally of Bengal districts it may be said that communication is too difficult in the rains, and that in the hot weather inspect- ing officers could scarcely exercise the necessary supervision. But in Calcutta and its suburbs, and in other large, circumscribed, and populous places, it appears to me that the head-quarters of vaccine circles should be established in that period of the year which is now called the recess, and operations should continue. It is evident that under such a system the organization and efficiency of the establishment would attain a development which cannot be expected from intermittent action. 16.

Ordinary establishment.ABSTRACT OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. 9 Respecting the reduced numbers performed in the suburbs, it is said that the falling off took place in the South Division. In the North Division, instead of a falling off, a small increase had to be noted. In his explanation submitted to Dr. Charles, it is said the Superintendent of the South Division urged as a reason the increased activity of the vaccination in previous years owing to the presence of small-pox, and the fact that many persons had been protected. He also enumerated several large and populous villages which had been removed from the suburbs, and the inhabitants of which had emigrated beyond municipal limits. Regarding this explanation Dr. Charles admits the reasons given as valid in some degree, but adds:10 ABSTRACT OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. the law has made it compulsory that all attacks of small-pox are to be reported at an early date, much that can be effected by energetic vaccination must still remain undone.&quot; METROPOLITAN CIRCLES.

Establishment ABSTRACT OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. 11 Besides these four districts, some men attached to this circle did work in the Hooghly district, owing to vaccine arrangements having been made before the transfer of Jehanabad sub-division from the Burdwan district to that of Hooghly. Twenty-three men under two Inspectors protected 385 villages. Of the 32,286 persons vaccinated by them, 32,266 were successfully so, or 99.93 per cent. The Fourth Metropolitan circle comprised only two districts12 ARSTRACT OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS.

No expense was incurred in establish- ing virus : the cost was thrown on the licensed men. DARJEELING CIRCLE. The following is an abstract of the annual report of the Darjeeling circle of vaccin- tion for 1879-80 by Dr. R. Lidderdale, the Superintendent. Government establishment.14 ABSTRACT OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. The Deputy Superintendent made visits to the scene of small-pox outbreaks in Runpgore in April, May, June, and July, and was continuously on tour from October to March. He visited 644 villagesABSTRACT OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. 15 was discredited also by 18 cases of small-pox occurring in persons said to have been vaccin- ated by dispensary vaccinators, and the Government men were consequently taunted. This matter has been brought to the notice of the Civil Surgeon of Rungpore. An inoculator, who was detected working in thana Borobari, into which had been introduced the law against inoculation, absconded to Assam, but it is not known what steps were taken by the Magistrate to punish him. The disease spread from these thanas as a centre to others in the district, and the Inspectors of licensed vaccinators and the native Superintendents reported 5,047 cases and a mortality per cent of 9.84. Small-pox spread from Rungpore into Dinagepore, producing local outbreaks. Here, in thana Beerganj, the Inspectors reported that some old inoculators, having been called by the people to treat the sufferers, took the small-pox scabs and put them into the village wells to infect the villages and spread the disease so that they might have a greater number of patients to treat. The Deputy Superintendent was ordered to inquire into this, but he did it in a perfunctory way, so that there is doubt as to the truth or other- wise of the statement. The Inspectors of licensed vaccinators reported 140 cases with a mortality of 13.57 per cent. Julpigoree received the infection extensively, but a severe epidemic here was averted by its having been the scene of vaccine operations during the past season. It lingered on to the end of March. The native Superintendent reported 586 cases in 23 villages with a mortality per cent. of 12.79. Seven fatal cases were reported from Bogra, and 16 cases, of which four were fatal, from Rajshahye by the Inspectors of licensed vaccinators. The police of Darjeeling reported eight fatal cases in that district, but others occurred which were not fatal. Of the eight, three were said to have been vaccinated, two by a native doctor at Soory in 1858, and one by a native doctor in the Public Works Department. The Civil Surgeon of Maldah reported 184 cases with a mortality of 14.67 per cent. In all the affected districts within the Darjeeling circle the civil authorities reported 8,144 cases with a mortality of 27 46 per cent., while the Vaccination Department inquired into 5,796 cases and found 10.38 per cent. of deaths. This great difference in the mortality is partly accounted for by fatal cases being reported more than once at the police-stations, and by the Inspectors and native Superintendents, after once examining a village, getting no information of the result in most cases of those they saw alive and suffering at the time of their inspections. No case of small-pox was heard of after vaccination on four points was done by a Govern- ment vaccinator In the villages attacked some had been partly inoculated, others partly vaccinated : in some inoculation and vaccination had both been practised, but in many the inoculation was of such old date that they were returned as unprotected. It was noted in 1,055 attacked that 88 had been inoculated and 18 vaccinated from one to 50 years before. The outbreak in Northern Bengal was severe, but the districts of Bogra, Rajshahye, Dinagepore, and the southern parts of Rungpore, forming the protected part of the Darjeeling circle, were only mildly affected. The Superintendent states that it was found that the self- supporting system of vaccination can keep the disease in check over large areas of country. Some means of segregation of patients and disinfection or destruction of polluted clothing are very necessary. RANCHEE CIRCLE. The report of this circle for the past season was written by Assistant Surgeon Kally Das Bose, who took officiating charge of the department from Dr. J. J. Wood in the end of March last, the close of the working season. Dr. Wood was in charge from 8th October 1879, and before him was Dr. D. Basu. Government establishment.16 ABSTRACT OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. A third party of 10 men under their native Superintendent worked also in Singbhoom. They began at Chyebassa, and proceeded 24 miles towards its south and to the east of the road of Keonjhur. They performed 6,249 operations with success in 5,840 cases or 93.45 per cent. The native Superintendent inspected 5,978 of that number with a percentage of success of 97.69. The last party of 10 men with their native Superintendent began their work also in Chyebassa and proceeded westward, but meeting with much opposition from the village headman there they betook themselves in a southerly direction 20 miles to the south of the place they started from. They protected 150 villages and vaccinated 10,173 persons, of whom 8,991 were successful, or 89.36 per cent. Of these, the native Superintendent verified 6,143 cases with a success of 93.96 per cent. Altogether 50,163 operations were performed with a success of 45,511, or 88.97 per cent., against 66,094 with 63,125 successful cases, or 92.97 per cent. in the previous season.

They do not keep regular and truthful records of their operations. They do not mind Inspectors, and will not be present to show their cases to him. They operate only on persons who pay them, and their vaccinations are not so good as they should be. There is no restriction on, or control over, their conduct. The Officiating Superintendent thinks that if such a state of things is allowed to continue long, discredit will be brought on vaccination. He suggests as follows :18 ABSTRACT OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. such a happy result was never attained before, and ascribes it, among other things, to the facility with which the vaccination was accepted in the Sonthal Pergunnahs, to the energetic assistance of the sub-divisional officer, Banka, and to the removal of all interference of the ex-inoculators. He suggests the introduction of the self-supporting system of vaccination in the district of Sonthal Pergunnahs, and the maintenance of a permanent staff of vaccinators and Inspectors for the districts of Bhagulpore and Monghyr. He thinks there may be a marked paucity of children next year and the work and expenditure may not compare favourably with the work of the year under report.

The ratio of success is almost the same as that of last year, viz. 99.62, against 99.71; and the average number of successful operations per vaccinator is 3,391, against 2,532 in the previous year. In the districts of Backergunge, Dacca, and Furreedpore regular season operations were not carried out by the paid establishment, but in the latter two districts regular season operations were made by the license agency, of which a separate report is submitted by the Superintendent. Backergunge.20 ABSTRACT OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. against 50,692 in 1878-79, or an increase of 63,660. While the number of persons have greatly increased (more than doubled), the ratio of success has declined from 99.50 in the previous year to 98.96 in the year under report. The average number of persons vaccinated by each vaccinator was 1,395, against 1,084 in 1878-79. The cost of each successful case was 0.82 pie, against 1.86 pies in the previous year. The Superintendent states that he can hardly look to the favourable results of the past year without serious misgivings for the future, and regrets that the licensed vaccinators have lost heart, and that there are no openings for the candidates who worked in an honorary capacity. Distribution.ABSTRACT OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. 21 that the so-called small-pox eruptions were nothing more than mosquito bites or some papular eruptions on the skin. But in those localities where epidemics of small-pox were prevailing some of the children who had already imbibed the poison caught the disease on the fourth or fifth day after vaccination, and this circumstance raised grave doubts in the minds of the people about the protective influence of vaccination. These doubts were, however, removed on the matter being explained to the parents. Some people are said to still labour under an impression that they will be subjected to fresh taxation for getting their children vaccinated, and therefore hesitate to bring their children for inspection. The result of the Deputy Superintendent's inspection is given in the following table :22 ABSTRACT OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. prejudice against it will be weakened, and the report now submitted shows that this is being effected by no slow steps.&quot; BEHAR CIRCLE.

On the whole 1,739 primary cases were operated on, of which 1,690 were successful, or a percentage of 97.18. Influential natives at Begumgunge and in its neighbourhood assisted by example and advice in extending operations. Two villages were inspected by the Civil Surgeon three times, and three five times. There was no record kept by him of the number of cases examined, but apparently he saw between three and four hundred ; and amongst those examined he met with 11 unsuccessful cases. The attitude of the people is said to be favourable to vaccin- ation. There is a growing regard for it, and the demand for vaccination near the station has been greater than the Civil Surgeon could find vaccinators to meet. Notwithstanding that vaccination is yearly gaining ground, inoculation is still largely practised in this district. No measures were taken to train inoculators. The Civil Surgeon is of opinion that until the practice of inoculation is rendered penal the inoculators in these parts will prefer to follow their own mode of operation. On the advantage of vaccination by trained private vaccinators the Civil Surgeon states that it will no doubt commend itself more forcibly next season, when he apprehends it will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to get vaccinators; and as the municipality is not in a position to import men, vaccination under official supervision will be at a stand-still, unless measures are taken for the introduction of vaccinators of the Vaccination Department. One of the private vaccinators, the Civil Surgeon says, had earned during the season Rs. 70, a sum very nearly double what he would have received from the municipality. Tipperah.30 ABSTRACT OF REPORTS BY CIVIL SURGEONS. total number of persons vaccinated was 1,359, and the avarage number operated on by each vaccinator was 226. The primary operations numbered 1,316, of, which 1,281 were successful, or 97.34 per cent. The number of re-vaccinations was 43, of which 30 were successful, or 69.76 per cent. The Civil Surgeon visited thanas Sultangunge, Alumgunge, and Bankipore, and found 1,146 persons vaccinated with 1,121 successful cases. Some of the people are well-disposed towards vaccination, others indifferent, while a few are opposed. Eight inoculators were under training last season, of whom four have learned the art of vaccinating well. Inoculation has been put a stop to within municipal limits. A large num- ber of people are said to die every year from small-pox.

Inoculation is much diminished in most of the large towns, with the exception of Doomraon and Nasrigunge. There are no statistics from which the mortality following inoculation could be estimated.

The poorer class of the people are said to appreciate the advantages of vaccination, but the well-to-do ones still prefer inoculation, which, it is believed, is still practised all over the district.

The Sanitary Commissioner will be requested to proceed without delay to this circle, and to report, in consultation with the local officers, whether the failure experienced has been due to any want of competence on the part of the staff, and whether he would recommend that the circle be maintained, or that the work be postponed until a larger staff can be transferred from the districts in which they are now engaged. It is to be observed that in the report for 1878-79 one cause of the want of success was stated to be a want of co-operation on the part of the police. This, however, is a difficulty which the local officers should be able to remove at once if they interest themselves properly in the matter. The other circles all show an increase. The figures for two years stand thus( 3 ) 8. The total cost of the Vaccination Department during the past year amounted to Rs. 1,20,017-10-3, and was adjusted as follows:( 4 ) It is explained that in Behar and Orissa the Superintendents personally inspected the cases. This, however, is not a sufficient excuse. The total number of vaccinations recorded in the Behar Circle was only 11,061, and the Superin- tendent should be called upon to explain why he only inspected 6,235 of these. It can hardly be expected that vaccination will make progress among a people who regard it with suspicion and aversion, if the superior staff do not exhibit more interest in their work than appears to be the case in this circle. In the Ranchi Circle, too, the number of cases inspected by the Superintendent was quite insufficient, and an explanation should be required. In explanation of the small outturn of inspection work performed in the Eastern Bengal Circle, it is stated that the Deputy Superintendent was ineffective from illness during half the season ; if this was the case, he should have applied to be relieved. Of the Calcutta Circle no details are given. Of vaccinations performed by licensed agency, 69.1 per cent were inspected. The officers of the Metro- politan Circle inspected 94.7 per cent; those of the Darjeeling and Ranchi Circles 31.3 respectively. In the Sonthal Pergunnahs and Eastern Bengal Circles only 53.7 and 16 per cent respectively were inspected and verified. The Lieutenant-Governor must insist on closer attention being paid to this important work. Little reliance can be placed on vaccination if the inspection is not searching and constant. 12. The work of the Vaccination Department is steadily increasing year by year.

G.REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE PROVINCE OF BENGAL FOR 1880-81. BY ROBERT LIDDERDALE, M.D., SURGEON-MAJOR, Sanitary Commissioner for Bengal. Calcutta: PRINTED AT THE BENGAL SECRETARIAT PRESS. 1881.
REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE PROVINCE OF BENGAL FOR 1880-81. BY ROBERT LIDDERDALE, M.D., SURGEON-MAJOR, Sanitary Commissoner for Bengal. Calcutta: PRINTED AT THE BENGAL SECRETARIAT PRESS. 1881.
No. 1235V. FROM SURGEON-MAJOR R. LIDDERDALE, M.D., Sanitary Commissioner for Bengal, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL, MEDICAL AND MUNICIPAL DEPARTMENT (MEDICAL). Dated Calcutta, the 30th July 1881. SIR, I HAVE the honor to submit my report on vaccination in Bengal for the year 1880-81. It consists of a general summary of the transactions of the year, and of very full abstracts of the circle vaccination reports furnished by the eight Superintendents of Vaccination, and of the dispensary and municipal vaccination reports submitted by the District Medical Officers; the whole supplemented by facts gathered from the sanitary reports of the Civil Surgeons for 1880 and my own remarks on points of interest deserving the attention of Government. Dispensary vaccinations to be desig- nated municipal vaccinations. 2. I should note that the vaccinations that hitherto went by thename of dispensary vaccinations should now be denominated municipal vaccinations, as the great majority of the results refer to the municipalities, 91 in number, the small remainder being represented by only 24 dispensaries. The Government is aware of the cause of this change, viz. the abolition of paid vaccinators from 1878-79 and the transfer of the sudder dispensaries to municipalities. Some operations coming under this head were also performed in some of the thanas in the districts of Chittagong and Noakholli, where the Government circle system of vaccination is not in operation, and a few in the Nuddea Rajah's and Angool Government Estates. Change of population. 3. In making the calculations the revised populations used in the sanitarybranch of this office have been adopted, instead of, as hitherto, the census populations of 1872, as the latter are at present incorrect owing to many changes in revision of areas by the alteration of thana and village boundaries and re-estimates of population having taken place since 1872. With these prefatory remarks, I proceed to record the transactions of the year. Control of Vaccination Department transferred to Sanitary Commissioner. 4. In the orders No. 150, dated the 15th March 1880, referring tothe reorganization of the Indian Medical Service carried out by the Government of India with the sanction of Her Majesty's Secretary of State for India, it was directed that the supervision of the Vaccination Department should form an impor- tant part of the duties of the Sanitary Commissioner ; that the separate appointment of the duties of the Superintendent-General of Vaccination should be abolished; and that the Superintendents of Vaccination should become Deputy Sanitary Commissioners under the orders of the Sanitary Commissioner, who is to utilize not only them, but the whole vaccination staff and the Civil Surgeons, as far as possible, in sanitary work. The above orders were conveyed to this office in Government of Bengal endorsement (Medical and Municipal Department2 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BENGAL Officers in charge of the circles during 1880-81. 6. In 1880-81 the following officers held charge of and controlled the vaccination circles:FOR THE YEAR 1880-81. 3 Scheme of Revision of the Vaccina- tion Department. 9. I have submitted for orders, in accordance with the wishes of Govern- ment and in consonance with the spirit of the orders of the Government of India reorganizing the Medi- cal Administrative Staff for India, a scheme revising the organization of the working and establishment of the Vaccination Department at a considerably- increased expenditure. The principal features of this scheme are:4 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BENGAL Dewangunge and Jamalpore in the district of Mymensing, under the Eastern Bengal Circle; and into thanas Barh, Futwa and Mussoorie in the district of Patna, under the Behar Circle. These areas cover 5,260 square miles and contain 2,354,615 inhabitants. Thus on the whole protection was offered to a new tract of country- extending over 10,144 square miles, and containing a population of 3,984,874. Operations with the lancet superseded that by the needle in the Ranchi Circle this year to a large extent. The division of work among the Deputy Superintendents in the Metro- politan Circles was not well arranged, and the plan of operations pursued in the Ranchi Circle was most unsystematic and very bad. My remarks on these points will be found in the abstracts of the reports of these circles. I might here mention that in July the Commissioner of Chota Nagpore and Deputy Commissioner of Lohardugga requested the services of the vaccin- ators of the Ranchi Circle as census enumerators in February 1881. As their services could not possibly be given for the purpose, inasmuch as it would lead to the loss of all living stocks of vaccine lymph, and consequently to the suspension of vaccine operations during perhaps two monthsFOR THE YEAR 1880 81. 5 From the figures in the above table it will be seen that the number of operations performed during the year in the Vaccination Circles amounted to 1,339,012, against 1,676,350 in the preceding year, and in the Munici- palities and Dispensaries to 55,300, against 66,645; and that the collective result was 1,394,312 persons vaccinated in 1880-81, against 1,742,995 in 1879-80. There was thus a decrease in the number of operations per- formed to the extent of 337,338 in the Vaccination Circles, and of 11,345 in the Municipalities and Dispensaries, culminating in a total falling off of 348,683 operations. This decrease was shared by all the circles except Orissa and Behar, where increased activity resulted in an increase in the number of operations, the latter circle thus redeeming, to a small extent, its reputation for continued bad work. In reduction of work the circles ranked as follows:6 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BENGAL Primary and Secondary operations performed. 14. The next table shows how many out of the total vaccinations wereprimary and secondary operations. The former includes 3,176 repetition cases in 1880-81 and 17,768 in 1879-80:FOR THE YEAR 1880-81. 7 1879-80; but the rate of success attained in primary operations compares unfavorably with the vaccination circles, and is not what it should be. Average number of operations performed by each vaccinator. 16. The information under this head is given below:8 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BENGAL so well; and this fact, and the large number of persons who obtained licenses, furnish proof that the scheme is receiving public approval, and that the licensees find that they can gain a living. It has already been shown that the licensed agency operations were extended this year over additional areas. Sex of the vaccinated. 18. The following table furnishes particulars bearing reference to the sex ofthe vaccinated. The figures do not include 10,217 re-vaccinations in the circles and 6,299 vaccinations at the cooly depôts in the suburbs of Calcutta. The sex of the re-vaccinated has not been furnished, it not being usual to register it, and that of the coolies was omitted to be recorded. The latter will be noted in future. In dispensary vaccinations the results of the Azimgunge, Saidpore, Goalundo, Lalgola, and Dehree dispensaries are excluded owing to the sexual populations in 1880-81 of these places not being on record :FOR THE YEAR 1880-81. 9 The collective figures show, for both the Vaccination, Circles and the Municipalities and Dispensaries, that the largest number of operations were performed on children of one and under six years of age, and next on the adults; the infants exhibiting, comparatively, a very low ratio. This was also the case in each of the circles, except that in Calcutta infants were vaccinated in larger numbers than those of other ages, and that in the Suburbs of Calcutta and in the Ranchi and Behar Circles infant vaccinations exceeded adult vaccinations. The circles that afforded the best protection to infants were Calcutta, the Suburbs, and Ranchi, where 43.84, 24.20, and 27.39 per cent. of the total vaccinations were operated on. Those that gave the least protection were the Metropolitan, Sonthal Pergunnahs, Eastern Bengal, and Orissa Circles, the outcome of the two last-named circles (6.12 and 2.24 per cent.) being very low. Calcutta has to be congratulated for the appreciable proportion of infants protected, considering that it worked to some extent, for the first time, under a new system inagurated under a new law (the Compulsory Vaccination Act), which is alto- gether opposed to the domiciliary plan of operations hitherto pursued. Religion of the vaccinated. 20. The table below shows the religion of the vaccinated and the propor- tionate numbers who were operated on under each class into which the population of the area under operation is divided. It does not include the operations performed at the cooly depôts in the Suburbs, by the Ranchi licensed vaccinators, and in some areas where dispensary vaccinations were carried on, owing to want of popula- tion of the cooly depôts and of the dispensary areas, and to no returns of the class of those vaccinated by the Ranchi licensed vaccinators having been furnished by them:10 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BENGAL Proportion of infants protected compared with births. * Azimpore and Lalgola,in Moorsheda- bad; Saidpore, in Rungpore; Goalun- do, in Furreedpore ; Nusserabad, Jamal- pore and Kishoregunge, in Mymensing; Dehree, in Shahabad. 21.

The want of inspecting vaccinators for this duty is great, for the Civil Surgeons cannot, for the most part, perform it, being tied down to their other work. Cost of vaccination. 23. The total cost incurred for vaccinations in the Vaccination Circles, andin the Municipalities and Dispensaries, and the average cost of each successful case during the year, as compared with 1879-80, are given in the subjoined statement:FOR THE YEAR 1880-81. 13 to the progress of vaccination are lessening. Complaints about the difficulty of realizing fees were, as usual, felt, but to a lesser extent than in former years. Not a single complaint was made in the Sonthal Pergunnahs Circle. The following facts connected with the licensed agency work are worthy of reproduction here. (a) In order to obviate the great difficulty that was experienced in controlling the licensed vaccinators in the Metropolitan Circles, a plan was adopted by which each vaccinator has to deposit Rs. 16 as security for good conduct, and to execute a deed of agreement binding himself to work accord- ing to the rules and regulations under a penalty. This plan might be bene- ficially adopted in other circles where the self-supporting system is in operation. (b) Owing to some of the ex-inoculators having behaved badly last year in Bhagulpore and Monghyr, in the Sonthal Pergunnahs Circle, the Superin- tendent determined to subject the candidates to a course of practical training before granting the licenses. The result was that not a single man would consent to be trained. This shows that these men never practise vaccination, but simply obtain licenses to impress the people with the belief that they have authority to practise inoculation. (c) Thirty-seven out of the 178 men who received licenses in the Eastern Bengal Circle did not practise. The cause is referred to a feeling of uncer- tainty as to whether they would be able to get a livelihood being entertained by them, and to the difficulty they believed would be met in realizing their fees. It is said that here vaccination is not sought for by the men so much as a pro- fession as a supplementary means to eke out a precarious and scanty living, and the Superintendent fears that unless something is done to improve their position there must sooner or later be a break down. (d) In some parts of the Metropolitan Circles men without licenses yet practise vaccination and charge fees, and the Superintendent asks for the inter- ference of Government to put a stop to this. Its evils will be found described in the abstract of the report of these circles. Although the Government might not deem it expedient to interfere, yet these men should be discouraged in every way. The effect of such work is well shown, in the frequent outbreaks of small-pox in Dinagepore, which was overrun by this class of operators. (e) At Ranchi the licensed vaccinators who worked in the Tributary Mehal of Jushpore were not remunerated for 1,500 cases, as the Rajah of the place ordered a forfeiture of Rs. 150. In this circle also the zemindars of Seraikela and Doogni compelled the vaccinators to levy a fee of four annas for each male and two annas for each female whom they vaccinated, and appro- priated to themselves one-fourth of the proceeds realized. Again, in many villages the zemindars as well as the vaccinators collected the fees, and thus both appropriated to themselves as much as they could collect. (f) The Superintendent of the Sonthal Pergunnahs Circle is of opinion that the time has arrived for the Sonthal Pergunnahs district being left in the hands of the local licensed vaccinators under a properly-organized plan with four or five vaccinators to supervise their work. I quite concur in and support the recommendation. Attitude of the people towards vaccination. 25. There are indications in the reports of this year that the attitude ofthe people towards vaccination was somewhat better, but still the instances are many in which extravagant beliefs and prejudices, fostered by the inoculators, men of position, influential and large communities, &c., are still entertained. They are mentioned in the abstracts of the circle vaccination reports, but the catalogue is too long for reproduction here. Local aid rendered for the promo- tion of vaccination. 26. The reports of the Superintendents show several instances in whichthe civil authorities could not, or would not, render material assistance in promoting vaccination, and of zemindars and others who passively opposed, or were actively hostile to the measure. No doubt, in the absence of a compulsory law, the magisterial authorities find it difficult to act in the matter. The police could render valuable assistance if they honestly advised the people to accept vaccination, but their sympathies are too often the other way. d

Transfer of vaccination in Calcutta to Health Officer of Corporation of Calcutta and in the Suburbs of Calcutta to Super- intendent of Vaccination, Metropolitan Circles. IN pursuance of the ruling of the Government of India transferring the Vaccination Department to the Sanitary Commissioner for Bengal, orders (Bengal Government No. 254T, dated the 25th May 1880) were also passed removing the vaccination in the town of Calcutta from the control and superintendence of the Superintendent-General of Vaccination, and vesting it in those of the Health Officer of the Corporation of Calcutta. In consequence, the latter officer, as Superintendent of Vaccination, took over charge of the duties from the 1st of June 1880. Under the same orders the vaccination of the Suburbs of Calcutta was made over to the Superintendent of Vaccination, Metropolitan Circles. The details of the work performed in this area, which used hitherto to be included with those of Calcutta, have there- fore been shown separately in the statements appended to this report, as work performed by the Metropolitan Circle, and the particulars relating to the transactions of the year have also been separately abstracted. The arrangements above alluded to with regard to Calcutta were ordered and carried out in anticipation of the passing of a law, which will be presently referred to, under the provisions of which the vaccination arrangements in Calcutta, admi- nistrative, penal, financial, &c., are placed under its Municipal Corporation to be conducted on a new and different principle and plan. 2. The following is the abstract of the Report on vaccination in Calcutta for 1880-81 furnished by Dr. K. McLeod, the Superintendent of Vaccination:ABSTRACTS OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. 17 This was perhaps due to the active steps which were taken to suppress the disease as detailed in Dr. Charles' report for the two years 1878-79 and 1879-80. This last outbreak aroused renewed enquiry, the result of which went to show that vaccination was still backward in Calcutta ; that a considerable number of the children born in and brought into the town was not vaccinated ; and that about 10 per cent. of the adult population of the town were unprotected. Inoculation appears now to be very rarely if ever practised within the area of the town. The voluntary and domiciliary system having been found insufficient adequately to protect the town, it was considered advisable to invoke the aid of law and render vaccin- ation compulsory and its neglect penal. Compulsory vaccination has long been adopted by civilized nations and communities, and in 1877 an Act, modelled upon the English Act, was passed by the Bombay Legislature, rendering vaccination compulsory within the town of Bombay. It was ascertained that this Act had worked smoothly and efficiently. After careful deliberation, Act V of 1880 was passed by the Bengal Legislative Council. It received the assent of the Lieutenant-Governor on the 12th of April and of the Governor- General on the 17th of May, and having been published in the Calcutta Gazette of the 9th June, became thenceforward, and by virtue of that publication, law. &quot; The new Act throws upon parents and guardians the legal responsibility of having their children vaccinated. It is no longer the duty of vaccinators to search for unprotected children in their villages and houses and prevail upon them to accept protection. It is incumbent upon all parents and guardians of children to take measures to procure vaccin- ation for them. The Act provides that every facility is to be afforded them to that end. The Corporation is enjoined to select public vaccine stations and make known their position, working hours, &c. ; to entertain a sufficient establishment of public vaccinators; and to make arrangements for the supply of lymph, inspection of results, and general supervision. Persons preferring to obtain vaccination at their houses are permitted, on payment of a very moderate fee (four annas), to claim the services of public vaccinators, or get the operation done by medical practitioners. A system of notices has been devised, by which every parent and guardian registering the birth of his child is reminded of his duty, and a system of certificates and returns laid down by which default may be detected. Facilities are also offered for compassing the vaccination of unprotected adults and children without guardians, and a procedure prescribed by which legal compulsion may be brought to bear on the negligent or recusant.&quot; Steps taken to bring Act V (B. C.) of 1880 into operation. 4. Immediately after the promulgation of the Act V (B.C.) of 1880, rendering vaccin- ation compulsory in the town, public vaccine stations, mostly in hospitals, were selected so as to correspond to certain police sections of the town and be situated in their centres. The establishment was distributed to these stations ; the rules required by the Act to be framed were drawn up; instructions were pre- pared and given to the vaccination staff; forms, registers, and returns were printed and distributed; the new arrangements were proclaimed to the people by means of advertisements and hand-bills, &c. All this took time, but by the 1st of October all the arrangements were completed, and the stations were in full working order. As under section 13 of the Act the Health Officer of the Port of Calcutta is required to serve a notice in the prescribed form (Schedule D) on all unprotected persons arriving in the said Port, and to prosecute before a Magistrate all persons committing offences under the Act, he was supplied with forms of Schedule D. A public vaccine station was selected at Koila Ghât police-station, and subse- quently at the Sailors' Home for seamen, and the time for the attendance of two vaccinators at the station was fixed for Wednesday between the hours of 9 and 11 A.M. to suit the convenience of the seamen. But, as it transpired that no seamen came to the public vaccine station, it was abolished, and special arrangements were made for their vaccin- ation during the hot weather and rains. In reply to an enquiry on the subject made by the Health Officer, he was informed that the Act applies also to persons on board of foreign vessels arriving in the Port, inasmuch as foreigners are subject to the laws of the country. Gradual introduction of the new sys- tem in Calcutta. 5. The new system under the Act being diametrically opposed to the old, as has been already shown, the Superintendent, knowing the frail hold which vaccination had yet taken upon the people, and the influence which custom has on them, and being desirous of not even losing that hold, resolved to effect the change from one system to the other gradually, and with this view directed the establishment under him, while attending regularly at the vaccine stations and inducing as many as possible to resort to them, not to discontinue vaccinating in the bustees. It is hoped that eventually, when the people shall have been taught to know and follow the new system, bustee vaccination will be discontinued, and the time and labour of the establishment thus employed economised. Establishment and its cost. 6. The establishment consists of one Deputy Superintendent on Rs. 150, three head vaccinators on Rs. 15 each, three first class vaccinators on Rs. 12 each, six second class vaccinators on Rs. 10 each, two third class vaccinators on Rs. 8 each, and one chuprassee on Rs. 7. There were two chuprassees before, but as one was found sufficient for the Deputy Superintendent, the other was discharged. The total cost of the establishment for the year amounted to Rs. 3,753-10-3. No extra or emergent establishment was necessary, and consequently not maintained. Gunga Narain Acharjee, the oldest vaccinator on the establishment, died during the year, after 76 years' service. E
18 ABSTRACTS OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. Conduct of establishment. 7. Dr. McLeod records that Deputy Superintendent Ram Chunder Mitter rendered very efficient aid in organizing the new system, and personally directed and controlled the work of the vaccine staff, and that the vaccinators on the whole worked well, the head vaccinators exerting greatly to carry out the provisions of the new Act. Area of operations and amount of work done during the working season. 8. Vaccination was confined within municipal limits, and the amount and value of the work done during the year are exhibited in the subjoined table, as compared with the results of the preceding year:ABSTRACTS OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. 19 quarters on payment of a fee of four annas for each vaccination. Rs. 350-8 were thus realized up to March, which correspond with the 1,402 vaccinations that were performed. Thus the station vaccinations constitute 13 per cent. of the total vaccinations of the year, the house vaccinations 23 per cent., and the bustee vaccinations 64 per cent. Sex of the vaccinated. 11. The table below furnishes particulars bearing reference to the sex of the vaccinated20 ABSTRACTS OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. Aid received for promoting vaccin- ation. 15. The police rendered every assistance when vaccination was carried on in turbulent quarters, and promptly reported all cases of small-pox that came to their knowledge. Cost of vaccination. 16. The total expenditure incurred during the year for maintaining vaccination in the town amounted to Rs. 4,842, and this amount distributed over the successful cases shows that the cost of each of such cases was 14 annas and 10 pie, against 9 annas and 3 pie in the preceding year. The increase is referred to the falling off in the number of operations. Prevalence of small-pox. 17. Small-pox prevailed throughout the year, but not in epidemic form. Altogether 110 deaths were reported, which gives a death-rate of .25 per 1,000 of the population. The most fatal months were April 1880 and February and March 1881, during which 81 casualties occurred. The sections of the town that suffered most were Colootolla, Fenwick Bazar, Moocheeparah, and Taltolla. The classes among whom the largest number of the cases occurred were up-country Mahomedans, Chamars, grass-cutters, and other low castes of up-countrymen, the prostitutes, day-labourers, manjees of the eastern districts of Bengal, &c. In fact, the disease prevailed most among the floating population. There were several instances on record in which small- pox was imported into the town by pilgrims, travellers, &c. The S. S. Rydalhall, which came into the Port of Calcutta in September, had a case on board. Vaccination was offered, but it was refused. There were several cases of the disease among the pilgrims on board the S. S. Clangordon, which arrived in Port in December. Although some of the men were sent to hospital and others vaccinated, several went to live with their friends in the bustees, and thus disseminated the disease. In some cases the railway authorities detected cases of small-pox and sent the affected to hospital; but in the case of travellers coming in boats from the eastern districts in Bengal, the men got into the bustees and communicated the disease to others before anything could be known of the matter. Mortality among infants. 18. During the year 2,630 infants died from all causes. This number yields a percentage of 33.75 compared to the number born (7,791). It has been shown before that 28.66 per cent. of the infants were vaccin- ated ; consequently the rest, or 37.59 per cent., a considerable proportion, remain unvaccin- ated in the town, or have left it with their parents or guardians for reasons submitted before. Measures adopted to prevent the spread of small-pox. 19. The steps taken to arrest the progress of small-pox are thus described:ABSTRACTS OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. 21 Dr. Gupta is localizing his vaccinators strictly. This will have a good effect in restricting the work within defined areas, so that the people will know easily where to apply for vaccination when they desire it. In order to obviate the great difficulty that was experienced in control- ling the licensed vaccinators, a plan was adopted this year of requiring each vaccinator to deposit Rs. 16 as security for good conduct, and to execute an ekrarnamah (deed of agree- ment) binding himself to work according to the rules and regulations of the Department under a penalty for disobedience and misconduct. The Superintendent reports that men without licenses yet practise vaccination and charge fees. This was done extensively in Burdwan, Midnapore, Jessore, &c. An instance in point is given of some Hindustani tikaits coming from Singbhoom and Manbhoom having nominally vaccinated people in many villages in thanas Bheempore, Jhargram, Salboni, and Gurbetta in the summer, whose oper- ations were generally failures, as they used only crusts. The evils of this practice are rightly stated by the Superintendent to be very great. The men might use bad lymph, or even small-pox matter, by which the disease may break out among the badly vaccinated and thus cause vaccination to be discredited; and their work, being under no supervision or check, is liable to be of the worst quality. Moreover, the Vaccination Department loses the subjects thus operated on, and its work is consequently reduced to a lower number of vaccinations, and the licensed vaccinators suffer in their earnings. The Superintendent again calls for the interference of Government to put a stop to this evil. This is an important point, and although the Government might not deem it expedient to interfere, yet these men should be discouraged in every possible way. The effect of such work is well shown in the frequent outbreaks of small-pox in Dinagepore, which was overrun by this class of operators. The people, it is said, entertain a notion that a child whose arms have been once scratched with a lancet is vaccinated and protected against small-pox for life, so that proposals for re- vaccination are not listened to by its parents. To combat this notion the Superintendent availed himself of every opportunity to tell the people that unless a child bears good and typical vaccine marks or cicatrices it must be revaccinated. The Superintendent has submitted with his report a map showing the areas in his circle that have been efficiently, partially, and less than half, vaccinated. I regret that want of time has prevented my having it lithographed and appended to my report, for such documents are very useful as illustrating the condition as to protection of the ground gone over, and the progress of work, and as serving as guides for future operations. From Dr. Gupta's map I gather that in the Midnapore, Howrah, and Bankoora districts there are still large parts of thanas which were less than half vaccinated in previous years and remain so this year; that in Beerbhoom there are five thanas which have only been partially vaccinated this year ; and that Jessore, too, shows similar areas It must be remem- bered, however, that Midnapore and Bankoora were added to the Metropolitan Circles with- out ever having been gone over by a paid Government establishment ; but I did not expect to find such areas in Burdwan, which has so long been included in this sphere of work. Source and character of lymph. Virus how kept up. 24. At the commencement lymph in tubes was tried to start work with, but as it generally failed vaccinifers were taken from Calcutta and virus maintained by arm-to-arm vaccination. Distribution of the work. 25. The manner in which the work of the working season was distributed among the staff employed to carry it out was the same as in the preced- ing year. The information is tabulated below:22 ABSTRACTS OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. The above figures present the following percentages of villages visited and persons protected in each circle by their respective staffs :ABSTRACTS OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. 23 (4) that coincident with the above reduction, the average work of each vaccinator had also fallen off; (5) that the value of the work as represented by the percentage of primary success- ful operations, is very satisfactory throughout. The causes of the falling off will be gathered from the following brief history of the operations performed during the season, taken from the Superintendent's report. Virus was established in all the four circles either at the close of September or beginning of October, but very little work could be done in the early part of the season in the 24 Pergunnahs, Jessore, Nuddea, Beerbhoom, Burdwan, Midnapore, Hooghly, and Serampore, owing to the severity, to a more or less extent, with which fever prevailed in these districts during the months of October, November, and December of this conspicuously bad fever year. In Nuddea, Jessore, Hooghly, and Serampore several inspectors and a good number of the vaccinators were laid up with the disease. This fever also precluded the unprotected children at Beerbhoom, of whom there is a large number, from being vaccinated. In the 24-Pergunnahs, Hooghly, Howrah, Burdwan, and Jessore there are few unprotected children, owing to the ground having been gone over several times, and consequently the vaccinators could hardly get a sufficient number to remunerate them. The Doorga Pooja had also something to do with the late commencement of the season's work. Thus it will be seen that, as stated by the Superintendent, the falling off, on the whole, of the work of the year is due to (1) the epidemic prevalence of fever in most of the 10 districts; (2) the laying up from the same cause of a large number of the establishment attached to this circle; and (3) the paucity of unprotected children in districts which had been gone over three or four times. Another drawback to progress was the difficulty experienced in getting vaccinifers, principally in the first circle, and this was most felt in cases where the children were of tender years, whose parents in consequence refused to send them to any distance. It should, however, be noted here that in Jessore, which suffered very badly from the fever referred to, a fairly large increase of operations was, as before shown, performed ; while Bankoora, 24-Pergunnahs, Midnapore, Hooghly, and Howrah, where there was comparatively a far less amount of fever, exhibited decreases, Beerbhoom and Midnapore showing conspicuously large24 ABSTRACTS OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. protect all new-born children everywhere.&quot; The Bankoora and Midnapore districts, having been lately transferred to the Metropolitan Circle, have not been throughly protected, but it is hoped that this will be accomplished in another year. A. new sub-division was opened during the year at Kandi, in Moorshedabad, and an inspector, who was hitherto attached to the municipalities, was deputed to look after it. Work performed during the recess, April to September. 27. Only 1,988 operations were performed in 85 villages during the recess in and around some small-pox-infected localities, against 18,723 vaccinations in the preceding year. This reduction is referred to the services of the vaccinators not having been required in Calcutta as in the preceding year, when, owing to small-pox prevailing epidemically, additional assistance was needed to stamp it out. The number of small-pox cases reported from the districts in the circle during the recess was also few. During this period some unlicensed vaccinators in Jessore surreptitiously performed numerous operations, of which many were either total failures or at best bad vaccinations, as was discovered during the working season. The men were punished. Sex of the vaccinated. 28. The following table furnishes particulars relating to the sex of the vaccinated:ABSTRACTS OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. 25 Inspections. 31. The results of the inspection of the work of the vaccinators by the superior officers are shown in the following table as compared with 1879-80:26 ABSTRACTS OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. The Deputy Superintendent of the 1st Metropolitan Circle commenced his inspections early in October, and ended them in March, during which period he was twice laid up with fever. The areas traversed by him were a number of villages near his house, several villages in the Hooghly district, large portions of Jessore and 24-Pergunnahs, in which he twice thoroughly inspected each vaccinator's work, and the Baraset sub-division. The Deputy Superintendent of the 2nd circle commenced his tour in the 2nd week of October and ended it in the last week of March, twice travelling through the districts placed under his charge,ABSTRACTS OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. 27 Total work performed in the Metro- politan Circles. 34. Although disposed of and shown separately in the pages of this report, it would be useful to exhibit together the entire vaccination work per- formed by the Metropolitan Circles' staff. The following table furnishes this information:28 ABSTRACTS OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. also reported to be generally practised in Howrah, and to some extent in thanas Mollahat and Morrelgunge in Jessore. One inoculator at Contai was found to have practised inoculation by making two punctures on each upper arm with a view of deceiving and passing them off for vaccination. After much trouble taken by the licensed vaccinators he was convicted, but he was practically let off by a nominal fine. This encouraged and emboldened other inocu- lators, so that this year inoculation has been practised in Nundigram and other thanasABSTRACTS OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. 29 before the district had been made over to the Metropolitan Circles. I am glad, however, to find that the Civil Surgeon in his sanitary report mentions that the prevalence and fatality of small-pox has lessened in this district since it was taken up by this circle, although a large portion of it yet remains to be brought under its influence. The above account of small-pox is the Superintendent's, but the mortuary returns of this office show that the deaths from this disease in the area under operation amounted during the year to 1,846, or at the rate of .12 per 1,000 of population. Of this number, Midnapore alone registered 1,417 casualties, or at the rate of .55 per 1,000 of the population of the district. April and May 1880, and March 1881, were the months in which the largest number of casualties occurred. It is surprising that in the Superintendent's report no allusion is made of this occurrence Evidently no report of it had reached him, and this simply indicates the inefficiency of the establishment, which neither knew of it nor dealt with it. Mortality among infants. 39. Of infants there died from all causes 31,393 during the year, and it has been already shown that 38,138 infants were vaccinated.

The Superintendent is of opinion that under the Compulsory Act and the public vaccine station system, the number of vaccinations will fall off for the first two or three years or more. His reasons are that the lower classes of the people, especially the up-country Hindustanis, are yet opposed to vaccination, and will not bring their children to the vaccine stations, and they have therefore to be sought out, talked over, and sometimes a little pressure has to be put upon them to induce them to cause their children to be vaccinated ; that the vaccinators have to hunt up the unprotected children and bring them to the depôts for vaccination ; that they have, under the Act, to report and prosecute people who refuse to attend to the notice served on them to get themselves vaccinated ; that if the vaccinator fails to prove his case by not being able to tender evidence that notices had been served on the recusant parties, he is liable to pay compensation to the person brought up for trial; and that these procedures cause the vaccinators to lose much time and submit to a great deal of trouble.

The subjoined table furnishes information as to the amount and value of the work performed during the year as compared with that of the preceding year :ABSTRACTS OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. 31 Of the total number vaccinated, the males formed the larger number operated on, but considered in reference to population, the female population was somewhat better protected.

General remarks. 52. The Superintendent closes his report with the following remarks:ABSTRACTS OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. 33 Thana Kaliagunge was somewhat too large for the staff assigned to it; help from Kishen- gunge and Phansedewah had therefore to be given after the work in these thanas had been completed. Source of supply of lymph, and how kept up. 56. The English lymph did not prove successful, many complaints having been received of its failure. That obtained from the Darjeeling hills was sufficient, and a small weekly supply was also sent to this office during the working season. Some of the vaccinators allowed their lymph to fail or die out from carelessness, and in some cases the obstinacy of the villagers prevented its being kept up; but on the whole the virus was well preserved and plentiful.

In the following statement is exhibited the amount of work performed as compared with the results of the preceding year:34 ABSTRACTS OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS.

This order is observable in the work of both the Government and licensed agencies, with the exception that the latter succeeded in vaccinating a larger proportion of Christians as compared with Hindus.

That the success that attended the operations is satisfactory, as before stated, is abundantly proved by the verifications of the work by all the different officers above mentioned. But the figures that gauge the inspection work of the several officers, as given in the last column of the above table, indicate that energetic supervision was not exercised over the work by all the officers concerned, for the ratios of inspection range from the absurd proportion of 2.31 to 13.05 per cent. of persons found to have been vaccinated out of the total vaccinated. In these remarks are included the Government agency Native Superintendents, for although a gross percentage of 40.89 is shown against them, the work of each man is represented by only 5.83 per cent. of the vaccinations. Cost of vaccination. 63. The table below shows what was the cost of vaccination during the year under notice as compared with the preceding year :36 ABSTRACTS OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. He, however issued orders to the police of Bhatgawan and to all the police-stations of Kaliagunge to explain to the people that vaccination is good for them, and is performed by Government officers of great skill. The Raj family of Putea and their neighbours are opposed to, and declined vaccination. In the sanitary reports it is stated that in Maldah the people are partial to inoculation; that in Rungpore vaccination is very little resisted, and the people are aware of its advantages ; that at Bogra vaccination has entirely superseded inoculation, and is now comparatively popular in the district; and that in Darjeeling, although many of the Bhooteas object to vaccination, it is kindly accepted generally, the people even requesting the attendance of vaccinators when small-pox occurs in their villages. Local aid. 65. With the above exceptions the Superintendent gladly and thankfully acknowledges the fact that he received in many instances assistance for the promotion, &c., of vaccination, both from the Magistrates, District Superintendents of Police, and other officials, and from private people. The police in thanas Kaliagunge, Bulrampore and Bahadurgunj, and zemindar Ajijar Rahamon, of village Chanderdhai, in thana Ararea, rendered material assistance. Inoculation. Kahagunj. Amour Kusba. Kishengunj. Ararea Buhampore. Bahadmgunj. 66. The Superintendent has no doubt that inoculation is practised. Evidence of their work was seen in thana Bul- rampore towards the end of the season by Deputy Superintendent Tajummul Hossein, but no offenders were apprehended. In August 1880 the law prohibiting inoculation was introduced into the thanas in Purneah noted in the margin, and into thana Phansedewah in Darjiling, but the police did not show any activity in detecting defaulters. The Civil Surgeon of Maldah mentions in his sanitary report that his district has not yet been taken in hand by the Vaccination Department. The Bengal Vaccination Act V of 1880 was extended to the Rungpore Municipality from the 1st July 1881 by a notification of the 10th May 1881. Prevalence of small-pox. 67. The vaccinating staff reported 617 cases of small-pox with 65 deaths and 552 recoveries. Fifty-two of the attacked were said to have been protectedABSTRACTS OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. 37 died before the establishment could be vaccinated. At Kalimpong and other places several outbreaks occurred, but they were promptly stamped out by vaccination before much damage could be done. There was a severe outbreak in Nepal, but fortunately it did not spread into British territory, although quarantine was not allowed by Government. This district is always in danger of being affected by the disease, owing to its being imported by the Thebetians, Bhutias, and others during the trading season, and especially by the Nepalese, coming in for work on tea-gardens, wood-cutting, public works, &c. &quot; At Jalpaiguri the disease prevailed rather severely in several villages, lasting generally from January to August. The poor suffered greatly owing to the unwillingness of those who laboured under the disease to part with their clothing. The Vaccination Department took active measures to stamp out the disease. &quot; The Superintendent of Darjeeling suggested in December that it would be extremely useful if a census could be taken of the people who were protected from small-pox by vaccin- ation. The question is an important one, but the proposition was brought forward too late for submission to Government. Moreover the vaccination establishment, who would be the only persons competent to take such a census, would be fully employed in its own duties when the general census was to be taken. Mortality among infants. 68. According to the returns 14,846 infants under one year of age died from all causes in 1880-81 in the areas that were under operation. Placing this figure and the number of infants vaccinated (46,645) against the estimated births of the year (250,280), we find that 18 63 per cent. of the number born were vaccinated, that 5 93 per cent. died, and that the large majority of 75.43 per cent. remained unvaccinated. RANCHI CIRCLE. 69. The following is an abstract of the report of the Ranchi Vaccination Circle for the year under review received from Dr. E. S. Brander, the Superintendent:38 ABSTRACTS OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. A third batch, consisting of nine vaccinators under an inspecting vaccinator, commenced operations in Baloomuth, in Lohardugga, and proceeded to the Palamow sub-division towards Lesligunge. After this they worked in Latiabor, in thana Manka (without orders), and thence removed to Bareysour. They closed the season by vaccinating in Ramkunda. Their total work amounted to 13,232 vaccinations, in 720 villages, attended with 12,214 successes, or 92.30 per cent of the vaccinations. The fourth batch, consisting of the same strength as the third, commenced work in thana Patan, and took up successively thanas Chutterpore and Hosseinabad. The last- named thana could not be completely vaccinated within this season. The total vaccinations performed by this party amounted to 16,405 in 814 villages, with a success of 14,179, or 86.43 per cent. The lymph supply was maintained from last season by vaccinating two children weekly during the recess in Ranchi. It was also kept up in other places by carrying on vaccinations during the recess owing to outbreaks of small-pox. This was done till September, when the parties proceeding to their respective areas of operations took a supply with them in tubes. Arm-to-arm vaccination by lancet was for the first time introduced this year. This process was adhered to in the majority of cases. It was not, however, carried out in Lohardugga owing to the negligence of the inspector, and in Hazaribagh owing to the licensed vaccinators not having been trained to vaccinate with the lancet. These men have since been instructed to use it. In the Tributary Mehals vaccination by needle and lancet were both practised, mostly by the former. The Superintendent thinks that it will be advisable not to grant licenses at the next season to men unacquainted with lancet vaccin- ation. The season's work also embraced thanas Turpa, Basia Palkote, Biru, Korambi, Burway, Lodma, but they could not be vaccinated, as the abovementioned work occupied the entire season. Vaccinators were, however, sent to Turpa, Basia, Korambi, and Lodma to stamp out the outbreaks of small-pox that occurred in these places. Licensed agency.ABSTRACTS OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. 39 afforded to the people lessened by 4.78 per 1,000 of population. The areas which contri- buted respectively to the increase and decrease above mentioned were40 ABSTRACTS OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. Of the total vaccinated, the largest number were Hindus; the next the denominations coming under the head of &quot; other races;&quot; the Mahomedans occupied the third place; and the Christians the last. But with reference to population, the Mahomedans and Hindus were the best protected, and almost equally; the Christians the least; and the &quot; other races &quot; intermediately. Ages of the vaccinated.ABSTRACTS OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. 41 Attitude towards vaccination. 79. The Rajah of Jushpore directed his subjects to refuse vaccination at the hands of the licensed vaccinators, and it was only after the Commis- sioner of Chota Nagpore, to whom the matter was reported, had communicated with the Rajah that the vaccinators were able to commence operations. They, however, complained that they were not remunerated for 1,500 cases, as the Rajah had ordered the forfeiture of Rs. 150. The Superintendent remarks that if the Rajah should continue this line of conduct it will be difficult in future seasons to get licensed vaccinators to work in the estate, and he suggests that the Rajah be called upon to maintain a Native Superintendent. At Korea, again, 400 persons could not be vaccinated, as the Chief of the place was opposed to the measure. The Deputy Superintendent of Singbhoom reports that the zemindar of Seraikela obstinately refused to allow vaccination to be carried on in his village notwithstanding that he was told of the efficacy of the measure, and the Deputy Commissioner had issued a perwannah requesting him to allow vaccination. The zemindars of Doogni and Banksai, being his subordinates, followed his example. Consequently these three villages remained unprotected. It appears also that the zemindars of Seraikela and Doogni compelled the vaccinators to levy a fee of 4 annas from each male and 2 annas from each female whom they vaccinated, and appropriated to themselves one-fourth of the proceeds thus realized. Again in many villages the zemindars collected the vaccinators' fees through their own men, and thus the vaccinators on the one hand and the zemindars' men on the other hand appropriated to themselves as much as they could collect. It was brought to the notice of the Superintendent during the year that small-pox was, as observed in the sanitary report for 1879, persistently prevailing in Ranchi, the head-quarters of the vaccination circle, without its being rooted out. The Superintendent replied that the disease was endemic at Ranchi to a small extent, owing to the resistance offered to vaccin- ation by a small section of high-caste people in the bazar; and he remarked that unless this resistance can be overcome by the assistance of the civil authorities, Ranchi cannot be considered as protected. I believe the real reason of the persistence of small-pox in Lohardugga is that the district has never been systematically protected. Various agencies have been employed, which have moved over the district in a desultory way, but never thoroughly vaccinated the people. On the whole, of the entire Native community the Brahmins and Rajpoots were most opposed to vaccination. In Hosseinabad the people in many villages were almost entirely composed of these classes, and they offered considerable resistance to the measure, until they were finally persuaded to submit to it. Local aid given for the promotion of vaccination. 80. The Deputy Commissioners of Manbhoom, Singbhoom and Ranchi, the Assistant Commissioner of the last-named district, the Assistant Commissioner of Palamow, and the Manager of the Sir- goojah estate, afforded valuable aid in promoting the work of vaccination. The Deputy Commissioner of Manbhoom, on learning from the Deputy Superintendent that vaccination was strongly opposed in the village of Jhalda, proceeded to the village, had himself vaccinated, and went from house to house and induced the people to accept it. Thus more than 700 operations were performed during his stay Inoculation. 81. The Act prohibiting inoculation is in operation in the whole of Chota Nagpore except the Tributary Mehals. There were no prosecutions for inoculation during the year, but it appears that the Rajah of Sirgoojah punished two inoculators on his estate. It is believed that the practice is carried in the other Tributary Mehals to a limited extent, and in the Hazaribagh district surreptitiously. Prevalence of small-pox. 82. Outbreaks of small-pox were reported to have occurred at Ramghur in Hazaribagh, Jhalda Roghoonathpore, Chas and Joypore in Manbhoom, Rohi, Silli and Turpa, and some other villages in Lohar- dugga, and in its sub-division Palamow. Vaccinators were sent to all these places, and they vaccinated nearly all the unprotected. No new cases were reported from these places after vaccination, except at Roghoonathpore, Chas and Joypore, where the disease was still prevail- ing up to date of report, April 1881. From the mortuary returns it is seen that excluding the Tributary Estates, from which no returns are received, 1,383 deaths from small-pox, or at the rate of .42 per 1,000 of population, occurred this year in the area under operation. The places that suffered at the highest rates were42 ABSTRACTS OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. The following account regarding small-pox is taken from the sanitary reports of the Civil Surgeons :ABSTRACTS OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. 43 on the whole, but 11 of them did not submit their annual returns. Their work cannot therefore be shown in this report. Plan and field of work. 89. The areas in which vaccination was carried on this year are noted below: 44 ABSTRACTS OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. Source and character of the lymph employed. 92. Both the Government and licensed establishments invariably used lymph obtained from the arms of vaccinated children. The fifth and sixth day's virus from well developed and perfect vesicles was only used. But under rare circumstances, such as distance or the refusal of parents, especially at Monghyr, to part with virus from their children's arms, tubes or crusts had to be resorted to. Recess work. 93. During the recess the following work was performed in order to keep up a constant supply of lymph in the neighbourhood of Rajmehal, and to check outbreaks of small-pox that occurred in several places:ABSTRACTS OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. 45 Sex of the vaccinated. 95. Particulars relating to the sex of the vaccinated are given below:46 ABSTRACTS OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. for which, however, no expenditure was incurred except a portion of the cost of supervision by the Deputy Superintendent and head vaccinators, the average comes to 1 anna and 1 pie for each successful case. The increase of expenditure is ascribed to a larger establishment having been entertained, and to increase of amount incurred for travelling allowance in some of the areas. The Deputy Superintendent reports that in this circle not a single complaint was made by the licensed vaccinators with regard to the realization of their fees, which they obtained with ease, and which were never kept in arrears. Inspections. 99. Particulars relating to the verification of the work of the vaccinators by the supervising officers are furnished in the subjoined table:ABSTRACTS OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. 47 very unfavorable to vaccination, but, as before stated, the zemindar. of Shubbulpore, Babu Kally Persaud Sing, very much opposed it, although at that time small-pox was prevailing in the very village in which he resided, and his example was followed by several other zemindars; but through the assistance of the sub-divisional officer of Banka, Babu Uma Churn Bose, the difficulty was overcome. In the sudder sub-division the inhabitants of Ranee Dearah exhibited the greatest reluctance, but they were subsequently induced to accept the measure. At Jamtarah the people resisted vaccination for a long time owing to the instigations of the local inoculators, but this year their opposition was to a great extent overcome. Local aid rendered for promoting vaccination. 102. Great assistance in this respect was received during the year from Mr. Rattray, the sub-divisional officer of Jamtarah, where vaccination has been recently introduced ; from Babu Umachurn Bose, the sub-divisional officer of Banka; from Babus Mudhoo- sooden Sing of Panjwara, Lucki Churn Mundle of Khoyra, and Amur Nath Sing of Poyargane, zemindars in the sub-division of Banka ; and from sub-inspector Mohadeb Lall of thana Colgong. The successor of this sub-inspector, Mofut Hossein, however, treated the demand made on him for assistance very indifferently. In Monghyr the local authorities and zemindars were indifferent to the subject, owing to which the work of. the sub-division of Jamooee came to a deadlock and remained so for upwards of a month. Conspicuous among those who exhibited this attitude towards vaccination were Maharajah Sir Joymungul Sing, K.C.S I., of Pursunda, and Rajah Ram Narain of Khoyra. The Magistrate of Monghyr also declined to render the assistance that was asked for in order to check the progress of small- pox in Khorgpur. He, however, suggested that the District Superintendent of Police might request his men to explain the advantages of vaccination to the people. Kader Shah, zemindar of Borborna, also refused to render assistance in protecting the people in his zemindary, although small-pox was prevailing in it. Prevalence of small-pox. 103. The following table, showing the prevalence, fatality, &c., of small-pox, during the year has been prepared from data furnished in the Deputy Superintendent's report:48 ABSTRACTS OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. It is worthy of record, as indicating satisfactory progress in the protection of the people, that the mortality from small-pox has been gradually decreasing year by year in the Sonthal Pergunnahs district: thusABSTRACTS OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. 49 Licensed agency.50 ABSTRACTS OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. With an increase of 39,664 vaccinations in the work of the licensed agency, there was a decrease of 33,104 in the operations of the Government agency and of 18,086 in those of the honorary agency, culminating in a reduction of 11,526 operations in the total work of the year. The quality of the operations was somewhat better and satisfactory throughout. The causes of the falling off are said to beABSTRACTS OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. 51 the smallest amount of protection. The last fact is also supported by the figures representing the percentages of infants vaccinated to number born. Religion of the vaccinated. 114. The next table furnishes particulars regarding the results of vaccination among the several classes of the population in the area under operation:52 ABSTRACT OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. case against one of the accused was dismissed, as the Magistrate was not satisfied that vaccin- ation and not inoculation had been practised, the former having evidently been simulated. The Superintendent is of opinion that fines in these cases are not deterrent, and that nothing short of the infliction of the full pecuniary penalty, or the imposition of the imprisonment provided by the law, will protect the public and cause the law to be respected This law was brought into operation during the year in thanas Mymensing, Attia, Pingna, Mudhu- pore, Dewangunge, and Jamalpore in the Mymensing district. Attitude of the people towards vac- cination. 118. The Mahomedans generally are much opposed to vaccination, and of them the Ferazee sect are particularly hostile to it, and no argument or persuasion has any effect with them, their fanaticism and bigo- try overruling every thing. No vaccinator can go into a Ferazee village and leave it without being shockingly abused, and no single vaccinator dares to introduce vaccination amongst them. A large proportion of the inhabitants of Eastern Bengal are of this sect; and as they do not also receive inoculation, they form an element of ever present insecurity against the appearance of small-pox. Among the educated classes of Hindus, the resistance to vaccination is passive, and not always enduring, but some of them are difficult to deal with. The objections of the ignorant and lower classes are more easily overcome, and generally they receive vaccination simply because they believe it is the Sirkar's hukum and they can get it gratis. The difficulties met with among this class are always traceable to the zemindar or prodhan of the village, who discredits vaccination from a religious point of view. Aid given for the promotion of vaccin- ation. 119. Excepting the interest taken in the matter by the Civil Surgeon of Mymensing and the Assistant Surgeon in charge of the charitable dispensary, vaccination was left to take care of itself. During the year the Maharaja of Shursong desired to have vaccination established in his place, and at his request vaccinators were sent there. Prevalence of small-pox. 120. The information regarding small-pox tabulated below has been taken from the Superintendent's report:ABSTRACT OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. 53 Superintendent were placed directly under this office, the orders from which he seems little inclined to pay attention to. Establishment. 123. The strength of the establishment employed during the working season, after some changes had been effected, consisted of one Superintendent, three head vaccinators, 27 vaccinators, and three appren- tices. The services of the apprentices were dispensed with after the close of the working season. The total cost of the establishment, excluding travelling allowance, amounted to Rs. 5,014-2-8. Conduct of establishment. 124. The conduct of the establishment was, with a few exceptions, reported to be very satisfactory, as exhibiting great zeal and activity in furthering the cause of vaccination in spite of great opposi- tion from the people. One head vaccinator was degraded for misconduct, and a vaccinator promoted to his post. One vaccinator was dismissed for disobedience and neglect of duty, and another left the service of his own accord. The places of these three vaccinators were filled up by apprentices. A few of the vaccinators were fined or warned for neglect of duty or absence without leave, and those apprentices who were found incompetent were dispensed with. 125. The areas taken up for protection this year were those named in the margin. The vaccination staff was divided into three gangs, each consisting of nine vaccinators, one apprentice, and a head vaccinator. One gang worked in Domepara and Banki and performed 14,313 operations, of which 14,150, or 98.86 per cent., were successful. The second gang took up the western part of thana Dharmsala and adjacent portions of Dhenkanal, Sukinda, Chousattipara, and Bolorampore, and vaccinated 12,641 persons54 ABSTRACT OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. Sex of the vaccinated. 129. The table below furnishes particulars bearing reference to the sex of the vaccinated :ABSTRACT OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. 55 On this point the Commissioner of the Division remarks that there would be no objection to a notice being issued by the Magistrate to the effect that vaccination is solely intended to protect the people from small-pox, or that perhaps the best course is to leave rumours- of this sort to die out when the people see that they come to nothing. The Superintendent also notes that some parents entertain a doubt about the prophylactic influence of vaccin- ation, on the ground that no eruptions similar to those of inoculated small-pox appear on the body of their vaccinated children, such eruptions being considered as the only sure sign of future protection. He explained to them that notwithstanding the absence of the desired eruptions vaccination is as successful in affording pretection as inoculation without the dangers that attend the latter. The Civil Surgeon of Cuttack reports that he visited the Pattamundi sub-circle without any previous notice, and found that the vaccinators were present, and that really good vaccine vesicles had been raised on the unprotected who had received vaccination. The Superintendent, instead of going into camp with his men at the beginning of the season and remaining with them, only appears to have visited them much according to his own convenience. In November he was with them only nine days out of the month, excusing himself for remaining in Cuttack till the 13th, on the ground that there was little work to be inspected, and returning there on the 20th on account of the arrival of his family, as if during the seven recess months there was not ample time to have arranged about their coming. If this Superintendent would understand that his business comprises much more than the checking of his vaccinators' returns, we should hear less of the opposition to vaccination in Orissa. Good class natives would, no doubt, accept vaccination readily if its benefits were explained to them by the responsible officer. To send a vaccinator to a zemin- dar's house without previous notice or information, and to expect vaccination to be received in ignorant backward districts, is only to invite failure. Even when small-pox breaks out, the Superintendent seems never to trouble himself to go to the affected localities. From the 13th of November to the 31st of March he was only, as before shown, 97 days away from Cuttack, and too many of this small number of days were uselessly spent in going and returning. This plan of inspection is also very faulty. He goes to one place, where he remains perhaps a fortnight, and passes all this time merely revolving round one small centre. If the operations have spread over any extended area, the best part of his time must be spent in going from and returning to the place he lodges at. He should have a camp and move it from place to place, wherever his men are working. His statement that he has travelled over 1,858 miles proves the inefficiency of his mode of conducting his inspections. Cost of vaccination. 133. The total expenditure incurred for vaccination amounted to Rs. 5,841-13-9, which come to two annas and one pie for each successful operation, against the same rate per case in 1879-80. Inoculation. 134. Inoculation is practised almost throughout the whole of Orissa, as the law pro- hibiting it is not in force in any part of it except the Balasore town. But it is said that in places where vaccination has been introduced during the last six years' inoculation is on the decline, as most of the people appear to recognize the advantages of vaccination and its efficacy as a prophylactic. The Superintendent believes that the time has now arrived for the introduction of Act IV (B.C.) of 1865, prohibiting inoculation, into some parts of the district of Cuttack, &quot; especially in those localities where vaccination has been introduced during the last five or six years, and where the people no longer entertain any doubts about its efficiency in affording future protection &quot; Of such localities he selects the sub-division of Kendrapara as the first area in which the law should be enforced. He is of opinion that the prohi- bition of inoculation would not only serve to advance vaccination, but would also induce the inoculators to give up their trade and take to vaccination, as so long as the prohibitory law is not in force it would be almost impossible to induce the inoculators to work on the licensed system. He says that even now many of the inoculators are willing to work as paid vaccinators, but that it is impossible to take all of them into service. The Civil Surgeon supports the Superintendent's recommendation in this matter, but would introduce the law only into the municipalities of the district, and he thinks that if the law could be enforced without difficulty in the Balasore town there is no reason why it should not be brought into operation in the Cuttack town also, where the people have had at least equal oppor- tunities of becoming acquainted with the superiority of vaccination over inoculation. The Commissioner of Orissa, after considering the remarks of the Superintendent about inocu- lation declining as vaccination is progressing56 ABSTRACT OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. higher classes, however, such as the Brahmins and Mohantees, still regard inoculation as a religious institution, and strongly resist vaccination, especially in localities where it is carried on for the first time. The lower classes are more amenable to reasoning and persuasion, and with them less difficulty is felt in inducing them to submit to the operations. Some of the zemindars and influential men still adhere to inoculation. An instance in point is submitted by the Civil Surgeon of Cuttack. A zemindar, who is an intelligent man and a member of the Municipal Corporation, was induced to have the two eldest of his five children inoculated. After the eruptions had appeared on them, the three remaining children were attacked with small-pox; one of them, a little girl died, and the other, his only son, narrowly escaped. He was anxious to prosecute the inoculator for using bad lymph, or for being instrumental in causing his child's death, but was told that in doing so he would be publishing his own folly. He was heard to remark that if he could be misled by the inoculators, what must be the mischief done by them when practising on the poor and public generally. Local aid afforded to vaccination. 136. The Magistrate of Cuttack issued purwannahs to the police and zemindars in the areas selected for the operations, and the police rendered every assistance they could in promoting vaccination. But the aid of the police was found to be of little use in inducing objectors to accept the prophylactic, as their presence appeared to make the people more obstinate when they were told that they were at liberty either to accept or reject vaccination, as there was no law in force to compel them to submit to vaccination. With few exceptions the zemindars, as a rule, take little or no interest in promoting vaccination. Prevalence of small pox. 137. From the report of the Superintendent it appears that about the end of January 1881 small-pox broke out in Righagurh, in Kanika, in Cuttack. The disease first appeared in the child of a carpenter, who died. All his family of eight members afterwards caught the infection, and also died. The disease then spread over 12 villages in the neighbourhood in the outpost Righagurh. It lasted up to the beginning of March, and proved very fatal, most of the attacked having died. Immediately on receipt of the report of the outbreak vaccinators are stated to have been despatched to Righagurh. They worked there, and in other parts of Kanika throughout the working season, vaccinating all the unprotected in and around the affected localities, and succeeded in arresting the further progress of the disease. Many of the children in Kanika were found to be unprotected, as the present Raja of the place had prohibited the practice of inoculation within his territory. The people were so much afraid of catching the disease that they with their children gladly accepted vaccination. Even old men willingly submitted to the measure. Another outbreak also occurred about the middle of March in Binjharpur. A batch of vaccinators was despatched to stamp it out, but owing to excessive heat and the opposition of the people the vaccinators could not establish virus and carry on their work with success. The Civil Surgeons of Cuttack, Pooree and Balasore furnish the following facts relating to the disease in their sanitary reports for 1880 : ABSTRACT OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. 57 roads; very large proportion of unprotected persons among the population of this district. where vaccination is little known and inoculation is - pretty freely practised here and there in an irregular manner, leaving large numbers totally unprotected; the greater susceptibility of certain persons to take the disease from unknown peculiarity of their constitution, and greater intensity of the infecting poison in certain places than in others from causes not quite understood. At Balasore small-pox prevailed throughout the district, but not very severely. The areas that suffered most were Baliapal (at the rate of 1.78 per 1,000 of population), Busta, Jallasore, and Dhamnugger (at 1.44 per 1,000 each), and Chandballi (at 1.15 per 1,000). The Civil Surgeon made a house-to-house visitation in the town of Balasore, and personally vaccinated a large number, and found that the people are getting over their aversion to vaccination. He hopes for better success next season. I submit below a statement compiled from the mortuary returns showing the mortality from small-pox in 1880 and in the first five months of the current year of which the returns have been received in each area in the districts of Cuttack, Poori, and Balasore, contrasted with the mean death-rates of the quinquennium 1875-79 :58 ABSTRACT OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. BEHAR CIRCLE. 139. The following is an abstract of the report on vaccine operations in this circle for 1880-81, submitted by Assistant Surgeon Mothura Nath Sen, the Superintendent, through the Magistrate of Patna and Commissioner of the Patna Division. Establishment. 140. The establishment attached to this circle consists of 1 Superintendent, 5 head vaccin- ators, and 30 vaccinators; but of this strength 2 head vaccinators and 13 vaccinators were not employed this year. It was a mistake not to have employed the full number of head vaccinators allowed, as any reduction in the supervising agency must tell on the outturn of the year and the manner in which the operations are carried on. Besides the above, 13 temporary vaccinators or apprentices, taken chiefly from the local inoculators, who, it is said, can more easily induce the people to accept vaccination than the regular establishment, were employed during the year. The total cost for establishment, including the salaries of a clerk and a peon, amounted to Rs. 3,916-13-2. One of the vaccinators suffered from ill-health throughout the season, and two died. Their places were filled up by trained apprentices. Conduct of establishment. 141. With the exception of three vaccinators, who were fined for neglect of duty, all are reported to have worked with zeal and energy. Plan and field of operation. 142. The areas taken up for operations during the working season were thanas Mussourie, Futwa, and Barh and its outpost Bucktearpur, and parts of Dinapore and Bikram, all in the Patna district. It will be observed that the four first-named thanas were selected in the place of others that were under operation during the last year. The reasons for this change will be submitted presently. During the recess operations were carried on in thanas Bikrampur and Bankipur in order to suppress outbreaks of small-pox and to keep up a supply of lymph chiefly by area- to-arm transmission. The vaccinators were divided into batches, each consisting of 3 or 4 permanent vaccinators and three or four temporary ones under a head vaccinator. These batches were again subdivided into three or four sections, headed by a permanent vaccinator, to each of which a certain area was assigned, which was to be roughly vaccinated before passing to another, the object being to concentrate the operations of the whole staff within the area taken up for the season's work. The work commenced early in October. The distribution of the staff and the work performed in each area are given in the subjoined table :ABSTRACT OF REPORTS BY SUPERINTENDENTS. 59 Amount and value of the work per- formed. 144.

Coincident with this increase the number of operations performed by each vaccinator was larger, and the propor- tion of the population protected greater. The quality of the operations was as good as in the preceding year. The Superintendent ascribes the increase to the operations having been carried on in a fresh area. He also reports that the outturn would have been better had the people come in together to get their children vaccinated instead of suiting the time to their convenience, and had not a severe outbreak of measles precluded vaccination being carried on during its continuance.

The verification of the work of the vaccination staff was carried out by the Superin- tendent. He spent, he says, most of the time from October 1880 to March 1881 in the performance of this duty. He tested the work of each batch or division of the staff once every month, that is, on the whole five or six times during the season. He visited 365 villages, most of them twice or thrice. He thus saw 9,713 cases of vaccination, or in the proportion of 67.75 of the total number vaccinatedABSTRACTS OF REPORTS BY CIVIL SURGEONS REGARDING DISPENSARY AND MUNICIPAL VACCINATIONS.

The lymph was supplied by the Inspector of the Metropolitan Vaccination Circles at Jaipur.

The Civil Surgeon visited two villages, and found that 452 persons had been vaccinated in them64 ABSTRACT OF REPORTS BY CIVIL SURGEONS. These figures indicate a great reduction in the number vaccinated, and unsatisfactory percentages of primary successful operations for both years. 865 births, or at the rate of 24.88 per 1,000 of population, were registered in this municipality. This figure, compared with the number of infants vaccinated, gives 24.85 as the percentage of infants vaccinated to number born. Of Hindus 5 86 per cent. of the population, of Mahomedans 6.91 per cent., of Christians 5.18 per cent., and of other races 19.23 per cent., were respectively vaccinated. The preponderance of the proportion of other races vaccinated is simply due to the smallness of the population given under this head in the Census Report of 1872. The Civil Surgeon visited all the villages within the municipality, and found that 932 had been vaccinatedABSTRACT OF REPORTS BY CIVIL SURGEONS. 65 lymph could always be obtained from Calcutta. The following table shows the work of the year under report as compared with that of the preceding year:66 ABSTRACT OF REPORTS BY CIVIL SURGEONS. There was a considerable reduction in the number vaccinated, but the quality of the work is good. The reduction is referred to the prevalence of small-pox in epidemic form in 1879-80, when the unprotected eagerly sought for vaccination. The recorded births in the Kishnaghur town alone was 561, or at the rate of 20.97 per 1,000 of population, which, con- trasted with the infant vaccinations shown in the above table, gives the absurd result of 2.38 per cent. of infants vaccinated to number born. The figures under the head of religion cannot be analyzed, as the populations of Bongong and Natuda are not available. The Civil Surgeon inspected several operations in the town, and three in the villages. Only the lowest castes of Hindus and a few Mahomedans are averse to vaccination. It is stated that there are no inoculators now, the old ones having joined the Vaccination Department. There occurred only one death in the Kishnaghur town in August. 10.

The Civil Hospital Assistant inspected 250 cases in two villages, and found that all were success- ful. The work of the ex-inoculator could not be seen to, as he carried on his operations at a distance of 30 miles from the sudder station. With reference to this man, who has worked suc- cessfully for years, it is stated that he was promised, but never received, any remuneration. He applied this year to the Magistrate for it, but there was no fund from which he could be paid. It is feared that as he receives no remuneration he will revert to inoculation. The people in these towns are, with few exceptions, in favour of vaccination. In the district inoculation is largely practised. The Civil Surgeon remarks that vaccination has not yet been extended to this district, and that it is much needed in it to counteract the evil effects of inoculation. No deaths from small-pox were reported to have occurred in either of these municipalities during the year. CHITTAGONG DIVISION. 28. Chittagong.76 ABSTRACT OF REPORTS BY CIVIL SURGEONS. Magistrate says that the result of its working was satisfactory. The Civil Surgeon advocates its re-enforcement. No steps were taken to train inoculators to vaccinate. In the year 1880-81, 286 deaths from small-pox, or at the rate of .25 per 1,000 of population, were reported to have occurred in the district. Of this number 2 deaths, or .09 per 1,000 of population, took place in the Chittagong town. In the Cox's Bazar town no deaths were reported to have occurred. 29.

But Mr. Lyons says that on the whole there is no doubt that a regard for vaccination is steadily growing in the district, and as a proof of this he mentions that he knows of 12 persons, a native doctor, a compounder, five ex-inoculators, and the rest said to have been taught to vaccinate by the above men or by the circle vaccinators, who had been at work in the district during this season, and had earned apparently a good income by their practice. Again, on several occasions children were brought to him for vaccination from long distances; for instance, from Ramgunge, in the north of the district; from Doodmukha, a village 14 miles from the sudder station; and from Ashirdija, a village in the north-eastern part of the Sudharam thana. The men stated above to have practised on their own account were at work principally in Chagulnya, Rajapore, Bamni, Bhoolooah, Ferashgunge, Raipore, Begumgunge, Seabag, and Sudharam thana. They either asked for lymph or obtained it surreptitiously. Those to whom lymph was supplied were asked to submit returns of their work, but only two of them did so, viz. one vaccinator at Bamni, who submitted a register of 137 successful operations, and another at Chagulnya, who applied for remu- neration for 1,035 successful cases. It is, however, believed that a large number of operations were performed by these private vaccinators78 ABSTRACT OF REPORTS BY CIVIL SURGEONS. had been kept up by arm-to-arm vaccination. The following table shows the work performed during the year as compared with the preceding year :ABSTRACT OF REPORTS BY CIVIL SURGEONS. 79 satisfactory, except that the success that attended the re-vaccinations is suspicious. The birth and class statistics of the above-named places have been already given in the paragraph of the report which immediately precedes this. The work done in the above-mentioned areas was examined by the Civil and Assistant Surgeons, resulting in 307 vaccinations with 294 successes having been verified. Excepting a few ignorant people all are stated to be well disposed towards vaccination. Inoculation is prohibited by law. No epidemic of small-pox occurred during the year. 32. Barh.80 ABSTRACT OF REPORTS BY CIVIL SURGEONS. municipality, one of the vaccinators even being sent to the interior of the sub-division. This accounts for the number of vaccinations being smaller in the year under review. The success that attended the operations, although better as compared with the preceding year, is yet very unsatisfactory. In this town 1,943 births, or at the rate of 43.86 per 1,000 of population, were recorded. The infants vaccinated placed against this figure give only 3.49 as the percentage of infant vaccination to number born. Of the Hindu population .63 per cent. were vaccinated, and of the Mahomedan 1.08 per cent. The Assistant Surgeon inspected 114 of the operations in the town and found that 68 were successful. He also saw 179 vaccinations among the dispensary patients, but the report does not show how many of these were successful, probably from want of opportunity being afforded to the Assistant Surgeon to verify them. The offer of Government to reward private vaccinators at two annas for each successful case of. vaccination has not yet produced any good in Behar. Almost all the people are said to be in favour of inoculation, as they hold to the belief that vaccination is not a sufficient protection against small-pox, owing to their having met many cases of the disease, which they will go on observing as long as crusts alone are used for the transmission of lymph in vaccinated individuals. Inoculation is largely practised in the sub-division, and surreptitiously in the town, where only the prohibitory law is in force. The Assistant Surgeon says that the action of the municipality in prohibiting the muni- cipal vaccinator to work outside municipal limits has contributed to a certain extent to the prevalence of the practice of inoculation, which he thinks is likely to extend, and with it the greater prevalence of small-pox, if the Government will not adopt measures to remedy the matter. He also states that several cases were heard of in which small-pox appeared in vaccinated persons three or four of whom were known to have been successfully vaccinated. Forty-one deaths, or at the rate of .92 per 1,000 of population, were reported to have occurred in this town during the year. The vaccination practised in Behar is evidently very bad in quality 34.

In addition ten extra men, paid at 2 annas for each successful vaccination, or in all Rs. 6-14, were entertained at the close of the season at Hutwa, Gopalgunge, Bhori and Chupra. At Chupra, Sewan and Revilgunge the vaccinations were confined within municipal limits; and at Hutwa, Gopalgunge and Bhori they worked in the villages in their neighbourhood. Attempts were made to thoroughly protect - one locality before proceeding to another. The lymph was kept up by arm-to-arm vaccination as much as possible. When this was impossible, selected lymph was preserved between two small pieces of glass for use.

There is no general desire among the people for vaccination. Only the poorer classes are said to appreciate it. Inoculation is still carried on all over the district, and the Civil Surgeon is of opinion that the difficulty experienced by the large body of ex-inoculators (who worked previously under the Civil Surgeon) in getting licenses from the Superintendent of Vaccination has led to some increase in inoculation. Eleven deaths from small-pox, or at the rate of .18 per 1,000 of population, were stated to have occurred in the Monghyr town, and none in the Jamalpore town. 43. Bhagulpore.ABSTRACT OF REPORTS BY CIVIL SURGEONS. 87 the vaccinator, the condition of the people suffering from lingering fever, and the failure of the lymph, caused, it is believed, by some peculiarity in the weather. The proportion of infants vaccinated to the number born (350) in the Purneah town comes to only 1.71 per cent. Of the Hindu population .37 per cent. were operated on, of the Mahomedan population .22 per cent., and of the Christian population 5.72 per cent. The Dhangers, it is said, have no scruples about vaccination, but the majority of the Hindus of the higher castes, and the Mahomedans especially, are adverse to it. Inoculation is practised clandestinely all over the district. 65.5 per cent. of the prisoners in the jail were found to have been inoculated. Thirty-one deaths, or at the rate of 1.93 per 1,000 of population, were stated to have occurred in the Purneah town. Matters have, however, been lately placed on a much better footing in this town by the exertions of Moulvi Tajummal Hossein, Deputy Superintendent of Vaccination, Darjeeling Circle. 45. Sonthal Pergunnahs.88 ABSTRACT OF REPORTS BY CIVIL SURGEONS. There was a considerable reduction in the number of vaccinations, and while greater success attended the operations it was still very unsatisfactory. These failures are accounted for by the fact that last year, owing to the great severity with which small-pox prevailed, many parents brought their children to be vaccinated; but this year the pressure not being equally great, the old indifference to vaccination revived. Crusts, tubes of lymph, and sometimes lymph carried in cotton, had to be used when arm-to-arm vaccination could not be effected, and this caused many failures in the success of the operations. Births are registered in the Kendrapara and Jagipore towns only, where they amounted during the year to 874; but the estimated births in the entire area under operation stand at 4,521. Calculated on this number, the proportion of infants vaccinated to number born comes to only 6.14 per cent. Referring to the religion of the vaccinated, it is found that of the Hindu population .93 per cent. were operated on, of the Mahomedan 1.13 per cent., of the Christian 1.60 per cent., and of the other races 1.73 per cent. The Civil Surgeon inspected the work in the town of Cuttack and in the Patamundi thana and its suburbs, but the result of his inspections is not given. Inoculation is not yet interdicted in the district, and is carried on chiefly in the mofussil. Every endeavour was made to induce the people to accept vaccination, but the Civil Surgeon says that one of the chief difficulties met with in spreading its benefits is the great dislike the people have to part with lymph to vaccinate others, and thus the vaccinators are hampered in their work. This opposition is experienced more in the towns than in the mofussil. Reasoning with the people and offering rewards to the poorer classes are the only means by which this difficulty can, it is said, be overcome. Inoculators are encourged to apprentice themselves as vaccinators, and are afterwards employed by the Superintendent of Vaccination. Many are, however, unwilling to be so employed. Small-pox prevailed with great severity in the Cuttack, Kendrapara and Jagipore towns during the year under notice, particularly in the earlier months of April, May and June, being a continuation of the epidemic visitation of the disease in the last months of 1879. The recorded mortality in these towns was as follows :ABSTRACT OF REPORTS BY CIVIL SURGEONS. 89 was not so energetic as the one who worked in the preceding year, but who, being a permanent compounder in the Pooree Dispensary, could not be spared for this duty ; that the area of operations was smaller, the work having been mainly confined to the town of Pooree and its immediate neighbourhood, where opposition to vaccination is very strong, while in 1879-80 the town of Pipli and its neighbourhood were also vaccinated; and that the opposition to vaccination is stronger when small-pox is prevailing, as it is believed that to offer a check to the disease would cause the displeasure of the goddess of small-pox. The success that attended the re-vaccinations is suspicious. The number of births registered in this town amounted to 535, being at the rate of 23.57 per 1,000 of population. The figure representing infants vaccinated, contrasted with this number, yields a percentage of only 2.99 infant vaccinations to number born. Of the Hindu population 2.51 per cent. were vaccinated, of the Mahomedan 2.30 per cent., and of the Christian 78.57 per cent. Besides inspec- ting a good many cases in the town, Dr. Gupta visited five small outlying villages within four miles of the town and saw 165 primary vaccinations, of which 145 were verified to be successful. As before stated, vaccination is actively opposed in the town, but in the mofussil the resistance is passive. Inoculation is said to be pretty widely practised in the district. From tables furnished by Dr. Gupta it appears that 296 persons were inoculated in the several thanas in the district, of whom 116 recovered, one died, and of 179 the results were not known. These inoculations took place during the months of January to May and August. The corresponding figures of the previous year were 911 inoculated, 718 cured, no deaths, and 193 unknown. These figures probably do not include all the cases of inoculation. The smallness of the number inoculated this year is referred to the fact that as small-pox prevailed in different parts of the district, comparatively fewer persons were inoculated. On the whole, however, these figures furnish evidence that this dangerous practice is approved by the people and freely resorted to. This town suffered very severely from small-pox during the year under review, particularly during the latter months of December 1880 to March 1881, when 290 out of the 340 total casualties of the year occurred. On the whole the death-rate' amounted to so much as 14.98 per 1,000 of the population. 48. Balasore.90 ABSTRACT OF REPORTS BY CIVIL SURGEONS. deceiving the Civil Surgeon. The people in the town have come to appreciate vaccination, and are now more inclined than before to submit to the operations, and the Civil Surgeon hopes for better success next year. But inoculation is prevalent throughout the district, the town excepted. An outbreak of small-pox occurred in the town in December, and had not subsided up to the end of the year in March. The disease appeared first in the begin- ning of December, in the person of a man who came from Cuttack for employment and put up at Baug Brindabun, where the coblers reside. The eruptions appeared upon him three days after his arrival, but he recovered and returned to his home. Since then cases of the disease were met with all about the coblers' quarters, and it lasted up to the commence- ment of February, when it ceased here, but spread to other parts of the town, where it prevailed to a more or less extent. About 100 persons were attacked, of whom 71 died up to the end of March. Not a single death was reported from the commencement of the year in April 1880 up to November. The death-rate stood at 4.03 per 1,000 of population. Every endeavour was made to suppress the outbreak by pushing on vaccination and advising the people to burn sulphur in their houses, to destroy their infected clothes, and to keep themselves as clean as possible.

OFFICE OF SANITARY COMMISSIONER FOR BENGAL, R. LIDDERDALE, M.D., Sanitary Commissioner for Bengal. The 21st July 1881. W. H. D'C. and othersMEDICAL & MUNICIPAL DEPT. SANITATION. CALCUTTA, THE 30TH SEPTEMBER 1881. RESOLUTION. READ( 2 ) 3. The following statement shows the total number of operations per- formed in each of the past three years in each of the vaccination circles, and in dispensaries and municipalities :( 3 ) altogether worthless. In the Ranchi Circle, the success in secondary operations is actually shown as greater than in primary operations, and in the Sonthal Pergunnahs, the proportion of successful secondary operations to the total number of such operations is entered at 94.62 per cent. With such figures as these before him, it is difficult for the Lieutenant-Governor to place much reliance on the returns furnished by the same operators of their success in pri- mary vaccination. All that can be said of those returns is that they are not inherently improbable, and do not bear on their face the evidence of their own untrustworthiness. The figures for Calcutta and the Suburbs can probably be depended upon, and these show respectively 8.06 and 17.85 as the percentage of successful operations in secondary vaccinations. 5. The average number of operations performed by each vaccinator during 1880-81, was 1,256 against 1,443 in 1879-80, and 1,191 in 1878-79. Increased work was performed by each operator in the Sonthal Pergunnahs, Orissa, and Behar Circles, but in all the other circles there was a decrease. The average number of operations performed by each vaccinator was highest in the Darjeeling and Eastern Bengal Circles where it was 1,870 and 1,721 respectively, and lowest in Calcutta where it was only 434. In the Suburbs the average number of operations per vaccinator was 1,207. 6. The sex of 1,394,080 of the persons vaccinated was registered. Of these 730,685 were males, and 663,395 females, giving a percentage of 52.41 males to 47.59 females Of the total number (1,360,038) of successful primary operations, only 166,853 were performed on children under one year of age, 824,358 on children between one year and six years old, and 368,827 on children above six years of age and adults. The circles in which the number of children vaccinated bore the highest proportion to the total number of vaccinations were Calcutta, the Suburbs, and Ranchi, where 43.84, 24.20, and 27.39 per cent. respectively of those operated on were below one year of age. The high percentage in Calcutta is especially noteworthy, as the operations were conducted during part of the year under a new system introduced in accordance with the provisions of the Bengal Vaccination Act, V (B.C.) of 1880. It appears, however, from the table given in paragraph 21 of the report that even in the tracts in which the best protection is afforded to infants only a small proportion of the children born are vaccinated in the first year after their birth. Taking the birth-rate at so low an estimate as 30 per thousand of the population, the number of infants under one year of age vaccinated in the year was only 13.94 per cent. of the number born in the areas under opera- tion. In the Ranchi Circle where the percentage was highest it was 37.4, in the Suburbs of Calcutta it was 26.78, in the Darjeeling Circle 18.63, and in Calcutta 17.32. In Orissa where vaccination has been much neglected the. percentage was only 3.42. 7. The total number of villages visited by officers of the Vaccination Department during the year was 21,628, while the number of cases inspected was 918,049 out of 1,326,628 cases within the area of inspection. Of vaccinations performed by the paid staff, 56.79 per cent. were inspected, the percentage being highest in the Sonthal Pergunnahs where it was 80.28, and lowest in Eastern Bengal where it was only 44.61. Except in the Metropolitan Circles, where the proportion of inspections to the total number of vaccinations was 123.27 per cent., the duty of inspection was very insufficiently performed in the circles in which the system of licensed vaccination was in force. In the Sonthal Pergunnahs only 47.82 per cent. of the operations of licensed vaccina- tors were inspected, in the Ranchi Circle only 46.20, in the Darjeeling Circle only 33.24, and in Eastern Bengal only 18.99 per cent. The Deputy Superin- tendent of the latter circle appears to have altogether neglected the duties of his office; but it is unnecessary for the Lieutenant-Governor to say here anything more upon the subject, as a special report is to be submitted by the Superintend- ent to the Sanitary Commissioner. The punishment of degradation to a lower grade inflicted on the head vaccinator in the Eastern Bengal Circle, who submitted false returns and fictitious statements of inspections and concealed extortion on the part of one of his subordinates, appears to the Lieutenant- Governor to be wholly inadequate. If the offences charged were all clearly proved, the man should be dismissed. The vaccinator against whom a charge of extortion is reported to have been established should also be discharged,
( 4 ) unless there were some circumstances connected with the case that are not mentioned in the report. So much of the work of the vaccination staff is necessarily without supervision, that when offences are detected they must be severely punished. The Lieutenant-Governor agrees with the Sanitary Commissioner that the Superintendent of the Orissa Circle, Assistant Surgeon Prisitosh Haldar, did not sufficiently exert himself to meet the out- break of small-pox in the Orissa Division during the year 1880-81. The Sani- tary Commissioner should report whether he considers the Assistant Surgeon qualified for his present post. 8. The total cost of the Vaccination Department in the year 1880-81 was Rs. 1,11,066, as compared with Rs. 1,20,018 in the previous year. Of the former sum, Rs. 61,550 represents the cost of the Government vaccination staff, Rs. 42,375 the cost of supervision and other charges incurred in connection with the system of licensed vaccination, and Rs. 7,141 the expenditure on vaccination in municipalities and dispensaries. The average cost of each success- ful operation in the province was 1 anna 3 pies against 1 anna 1½ pies in 1879-80, and 1 anna 6 pies in 1878-79. The average cost of each operation by the Government staff was 1 anna 10¾ pies, of each operation by the licensed agency 10¼ pies, and of each operation in dispensaries and municipalities 2 annas 3¾ pies. The cost of each successful case in Calcutta was 14 annas 10 pies, in the suburbs 6 annas 10 pies, in Behar 5 annas 1 pie, in Orissa 2 annas 1 pie, in the Metropolitan Circles 1 anna 5¼ pies, in the Ranchi Circle 1 anna 2 pies, in the Sonthal Pergunnahs 1 anna 1 1/5 pies, in the Darjeeling Circle 1 anna 01/3 pies, and in the Eastern Bengal Circle 7½ pies. The general increase in the average cost of operations in the past year as compared with 1879-80 is due to the distribution of the charges for establishment over a smaller number of operations; for although the gross cost of the department was lower last year than in the previous year, the proportion of decrease to the total cost was far below the proportion of decrease in operations to the total operations of the department. 9. There are indications in the reports of the year that the attitude of the people towards vaccination is improving throughout the province, as well as in Calcutta and the Suburbs where a law making vaccination compulsory has been successfully introduced with the approval of the public. There are still, however, many instances in which extravagant beliefs and prejudices are held against vaccination, and the names of several persons of influence and- position are mentioned in the report as opponents of the work of the department. The Sanitary Commissioner should inform the Inspector-General of Police of the nature of the opposition offered by Mofut Hossein, Inspector of the Colgong thana, and the matter will then be properly enquired into and dealt with. It would seem, from the abstract of the Superintendent's report, that the inspector was passively indifferent rather than actively opposed to the opera- tions of the department. All cases of opposition by the police should be at once brought to the notice of the Magistrate by the local officers of the Vaccination Department. . The thanks of Government are due to the zemindars Gopendra Nath Chowdhri of Purchetgurh and Kaliporosonno Gojendra Mohapatro of Khemdroee, to Ali Jan Meah and Baboos Shamachurn Ruth and Ajudhya Nath Koila of Midnapore, to Ajijar Rahman of Chanderdhai in Purneah, and to Baboos Modhosudan Sing, Lakhicharn Mondal, and Amar Nath Sing, zemindars in the Banka sub division, for the assistance given by them to the operations of the department. It is satisfactory to learn that the Maharajah of Shusung asked last year that vaccination might be introduced in his estate, and the Lieutenant-Governor trusts that the example set by him and the other gentle- men named above will be followed by other zemindars and persons of influence throughout the country. In order to break down the opposition offered at the village of Jhalda in Manbhoom, the Deputy Commissioner, Mr. A. L. Clay, caused himself to be vaccinated, and then went from house to house and induced the people to be operated upon. The attention of Commissioners of Divisions will be drawn to the remarks of the Sanitary Commissioner in the body of his report as well as in the appended abstracts regarding the zemindars and others who obstructed vaccination operations during the past year. Local officers should impress the advantages of vaccination upon influential land- holders in their jurisdiction, and should use all legitimate means to persuade
( 5 ) the people to accept the services of the vaccination staff. The Commis- sioner of Chota Nagpore -will be requested to submit a special report regarding the chiefs and zemindars mentioned in paragraph 79 of the abstract. 10. Act IV. (B.C.) of 1865, prohibiting the practice of inoculation, was last year extended to the Darjeeling Terai, six thanas in Purneah, the town of Pooree, six thanas in Mymensing, and four thanas in Patna, and since the close of the year the Act has been introduced into seven more thanas in the Purneah district. The Sanitary Commissioner. should submit in a separate report his proposals for the gradual extension of the Act to the whole of the Orissa Circle, as well as the proposal for shortening the channel of communication between himself and the Superintendent of the Orissa Circle. Such suggestions should not be scattered casually about the report and its appendices, for it is impos- sible for the Lieutenant-Governor to deal with them satisfactorily when reviewing the annual administration report of a department. The Compulsory Vaccination Act V (B.C.) of 1880 came into operation in Calcutta and the Suburbs and in the Port of Calcutta on the 17th May 1880, and the arrange- ments made for its introduction and working have already been noticed by the Lieutenant-Governor in his review of the Health Officer's report appended to the report of the Calcutta Municipality for the past year.. Since the close of the year the Act has been extended to the municipalities of Rampore Beauleah, Rung- pore, Hooghly and Chinsurah, and Soory. The arrangements for working the Act in Calcutta and the Suburbs are under the Corporation and the Suburban Municipality respectively, each of which receives the receipts and has to bear the expenditure under the Act. The vaccine operations in Calcutta are under the control and supervision of the Health Officer, and in the Suburbs under the Superintendent of Vaccination of the Metropolitan Circles. The recorded deaths from small-pox in 1880-81 in the area under the operations of the Vacci- nation Department in the several vaccination circles were .30 per thousand of the population, while in the area not under operation in the same districts the mortality was .67 per thousand. 11. In accordance with instructions recently received from the Govern- ment of India, the present report will be the last separate report on the Vacci- nation Department. The report on the working of the Department will in future be incorporated in the report on sanitation, and the information required should be given in a more concise form than in the present report which consists of 91 pages of letter-press alone as compared with 32 pages in the previous year. Anything of interest or importance in the reports of the Superintendents of Circles and Civil Surgeons should in future be embodied in the Sanitary Commissioner's report, and not be given separately in a long appendix. 12. The Lieutenant-Governor has abstained for the present from passing any orders on the scheme mentioned in paragraph 9 of the report, for the reorganization of the Vaccination and Sanitation Departments at an increased cost of Rs. 88,800 per annum. The scheme in its present form does not commend itself to the Lieutenant-Governor, and Dr. Lidderdale will be requested to reconsider it on his return from leave. Sir Ashley Eden's views on the subject will be then communicated to the Sanitary Commissioner. ORDER.( 6 ) No. 203.

SIR, I HAVE the honour, in accordance with the orders of the Govern- ment of India, No. 28( 2 ) Work of the year. 5. The total number of vaccinations per- formed in Bengal during the year 1888-89 was( 3 ) Vaccination according to age. 8. The following statement shows the ages of the successfully-vaccinatedpersons and the proportion per cent. to total primary operations during the year under review:( 4 ) well-to-do classes, viz. Brahmans, Kayasths, Baniyas, and in some places village mandals. Complaints are from time to time made to this office by the executive officers of the Vaccination Department of the great difficulty experienced by licensed vaccinators in realising their fees from the persons vaccinated. The fee is only two annas an operation, which it would not be worth the vacci- nator's while to sue for in a civil court on account of the expense of instituting a suit. It has been suggested that the police or the village punchayat should help the vaccinators in realising their fees, but both these agencies are, in my opinion, open to objection. Extension of vaccination. 12. During the year under report vaccination was introduced for the firsttime into the district of Chittagong, and up to the close of the year 8 out of the 13 thanas of thatdistrict had been protected by the Government staff of vaccinators. In Behar vaccination was extended to the 4 remaining thanas of Gya. In 8 out of the 11 thanas of Sarun and 7 out of the 9 thanas of Chumparun vaccination operations were performed for the first time to suppress local outbreaks of small-pox. None of the thanas of these two districts have as yet been taken up thoroughly for vaccination purposes. In 6 out of the 9 thanas of the Balasore district vacci- nation was introduced for the first time by the Government staff. The licensed system of vaccination was extended to the 9 remaining thanas of Backergunge and to 5 thanas of Gya and the 3 remaining thanas of Puri. The map facing this page shows at a glance the progress or extent to which vaccination has been introduced in Bengal, viz., the areas in which Act IV (B.C.) of 1865, prohibiting the practice of inoculation, is in force and the areas to which it has not yet been extended; the municipalities and thanas of rural areas in which the Compulsory Vaccination Act V (B.C.) of 1880 is in force; and the present boundaries of the vaccination circles, 13.

It was extended to the four remaining thanas of Gya, and to six thanas of Balasore: some vaccination operations were also performed for the first time to suppress local outbreaks of small-pox in Sarun and Chumparun. A useful map, illustrating the extent to which vaccination has been intro- duced in Bengal, accompanies the Sanitary Commissioner's notes. From this it appears that the practice of inoculation is prohibited in all parts of Bengal, except the rural portions of the Durbhunga, Mozufferpore, Sarun, and Chum- parun districts in Behar, a small portion of Balasore in Orissa, and the Cox's Bazar subdivision in Chittagong. Favourable remarks have been recorded by Dr. Gregg concerning the good work done by Drs. Wood, Gupta, and Waddell and Assistant Surgeon Narendra Nath Gupta. Mention has also been made of the services rendered by Assistant Surgeons Umesh Chunder Ghose, Preumber Nath Mitter, Ashutosh Law, and Moulvie Tajamul Hossain, Deputy Superintendents of Vaccination. The obser- vations will be communicated to the Appointment Department. By order of the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, H. J. S. COTTON, Offg. Secretary to the Govt. of Bengal. No. S 1R/9 2.
