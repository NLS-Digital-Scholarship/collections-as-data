[APP. thoroughly investigated, each variety of the drug being separately treated so far as that can be conveniently done. In conducting this branch of the enquiry, the Commissioners should avail themselves freely of the evidence of medical experts. They should endeavour to ascertain what proportion of the population habitually consumes hemp-drugs, and should thoroughly examine the testimony in support of the commonly received opinion that the use of hemp-drugs is a frequent cause of lunacy. They should ascertain whether, and in what form, the consump- tion of the drugs is either harmless or even beneficial, as has occasionally been maintained. 6. Full information should be compiled regarding the administrative arrangements in force in each province for controlling the growth of the plant, the manufacture and sale of the drugs, and their importation from other provinces or from Native States, and for imposing duties on cultivation and sale. It is understood that charas is imported into the Punjab on a considerable scale from foreign territory, and the question of the importation of hemp-drugs generally from foreign territory should receive the special attention of the Commission. The various systems employed for taxing the drug or the cultivation of the plant should be review- ed, with especial reference to the comparative incidence of this taxation in different parts of India, and to the comparative efficacy of the taxation imposed in restricting consumption, whether by the mere weight of the tax, or by the method and stage of imposition. It is known that the rates vary considerably in different provinces, but the precise effect of the variations is not fully understood. In this connection the Commissioners should notice any case in which the proximity of a Native State affects the production or consumption of the drug in British territory. 7. There are two points connected with the subject-matter of the enquiry which call for special investigation. The first of these is the danger lest prohibition, or restrictive measures of a stringent character, may give rise to serious discontent, and be resented by the people as an unjustifiable interference with long-established social customs. In some parts of India the use of hemp-drugs is, it is believed, common among fakirs and ascetics held in veneration by large classes of the population. In Bengal it has been stated that an infusion of the leaves of the plant is commonly offered to every guest and member of the family on the last day of the Durga Pujah: it has no ill effects, and its use is not considered reprehensible in any way. The Governor-General in Council desires that the Commissioners will endeavour to ascertain to what extent these and similar customs prevail in Bengal and other parts of India, and how far the use of hemp drugs forms a part of social, or possibly religious, ceremonial or observance, and they should, if possible, take the evidence of witnesses drawn from the classes among whom the use of hemp-drugs is chiefly prevalent. The Commissioners should state their opin- ion whether the prohibition of the use of hemp-drugs or any restrictive measures which they may deem practicable would be likely to give rise to political discontent in any parts of India or among any classes of the population. It is believed that in some parts of the country bhang is, in a special degree, the poor man's narcotic, and the possible unpopularity of a measure which would deprive the very poorest of the population of the use of a narcotic to which they have always been accustomed should not be overlooked. 8. Another point to which the attention of the Commissioners should be directed is the probability or possibility, that if the use of hemp-drugs is prohibited, those who would other- wise continue to use them may be driven to have recourse to alcohol, or to other stimulants or narcotics which may be more deleterious. 9. Finally, the Governor-General in Council requests that the Commissioners, if they should be of opinion that the prohibition of the consumption of any hemp-drug should not, or could not, be enforced, will indicate, for the consideration of the Government of India, any reforms and improvements which their investigations may lead them to recommend in the ex- isting arrangements of each province for controlling the cultivation of the hemp plant, and the manufacture, sale, and taxation of hemp-drugs. In framing their recommendations regard should, of course, be had to the considerations which have been stated in paragraphs 7 and 8 of this Resolution. Absolute prohibition, or repressive measures of a stringent nature, may involve inquisitorial proceedings of an unpopular character, and afford opportunities for the levy of blackmail; and in framing regulations for the prohibition or for the restriction of the use of hemp-drugs these considerations should be borne in mind. If the Commission should be of opinion that the cultivation of the hemp plant for the production of drugs, or the consumption of any hemp drug, should be absolutely prohibited, it will be their duty to state the regulations which should be adopted for this purpose. 10. All Local Governments and Administrations have been requested to render every as- sistance to the Commission, to collect and place at its disposal whatever information may be available, and to make to the Commission any suggestions regarding the enquiry which local knowledge and experience may suggest. 11. The Governor-General in Council directs that the Commission shall assemble in Cal- cutta on the 1st August 1893. J. F. FINLAY, Secretary to the Government of India.
BENGAL MEMORANDUM. 3 BENGAL MEMORANDUM. 1. There is a uniform system throughout the Lower Provinces. 2. Hemp drugs, of which ganja is the principal, constitute one of the chief sources of excise revenue in Bengal. 3. In excise matters there is one central controlling authority, which is vested now in the Commissioner of Excise, acting under the general control of the Board of Revenue. The ex- cise department of each district is managed by a selected Deputy Collector under the personal supervision of the Collector, who is primarily responsible for the administration of the excise of his district. In the more important districts there is a Special Deputy Collector mainly for excise work. With the appointment of a Commissioner of Excise under section 33 of the Bengal Excise Act, VII of 1878, from the 4th April 1889 the connection of Divisional Com- missioners with excise ceased, but recently (from 1st April 1893) they have again been brought into touch with the department by executive arrangement, in accordance with which annual and other reports and proposals involving any change in principle and policy pass through them. 4. The Excise Commissioner is assisted in the work of inspection by two Deputy Collec- tors under the designation of Inspectors of Excise. The subordinate district agency consists of Superintendents, Deputy Inspectors, Sub-Inspectors, clerks, jamadars, and peons, who are variously employed in the management of central distilleries, in the inspection of shops, in the collection of revenue, and the compilation of statistics, and in the detection and preven- tion of excise offences, and who are controlled by the Excise Deputy Collector acting under the orders of the Collector. The system of excise on hemp-drugs is based on the Bengal Council Act, VII of 1878, and the Regulation and Acts noted on the margin, as well as on the Board's Excise Manual and the circulars issued by the Board from time to time. Regulation II of 1793, section 7, and clause 10 of section 8. Act II (B.C.) of 1866, sections 18 to 24. Act IV (B.C.) of 1866, sections 35 to 41. 5. The following sections or parts of sections of the Bengal Excise Act relate specially to hemp-drugs:4 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. the cultivator on whose land it is found is only too glad to get any one to remove this trouble- some weed, and all that the collector of the drug has to pay are wages for gathering and drying the leaves and cartage to the gola. 8. The cultivation of the hemp plant for the production of ganja is permitted under special licenses. Prior to the passing of Act II (B.C.) of 1876 persons engaged in the culti- vation of ganja apparently were not required to take out licenses, though by section XXIII of Act XXI of 1856 the Board of Revenue were empowered to "place the cultivation, prepara- tion, and store of the drugs under such supervision as may be deemed to be necessary to secure the duty leviable thereon," and by section L of the same Act the cultivators of ganja and bhang were prohibited from selling the drug to any one other than a licensed vendor or other duly authorized purchaser. Unlicensed cultivation was prohibited under sec- tion 13 of the Bengal Council Act, No. II, 1876. The same provision has been retained in section 54 of the present Act, VII (B.C.) of 1878, and every cultivator has to take out a license for which no fee is charged. 9. During the first half of the present century the district of Jessore was celebrated for its ganja, and large quantities of the drug were prepared there for the market. The cultivation in Jessore was entirely suppressed in 1875. Ganja is now cultivated in a compact tract of country with a radius of about 16 miles lying in three districts, viz., Dinajpur, Rajshahi, and Bogra. The whole tract, though situated in three districts, is for the purposes of ganja admin- istration, placed under the jurisdiction of the Collector of Rajshahi, who is styled the Super- intendent of the Ganja Mahal, the Sub-divisional Officer of Naogaon, who is in immediate charge, being designated Deputy Superintendent. The cultivation and manufacture of ganja and its sale by cultivators are regulated by clauses 3 to 27, section XX of the Excise Manual, pages 154 and 158. Clause 3, section XX, Excise Manual. Clause 4, section XX. 10. Any person who intends to cultivate the hemp plant for the purpose of making ganja must first apply in writing to the Sub-Deputy Collector at Naogaon, who is also the supervisor of the Ganja Mahal, for a license authorising him to cultivate. The license is ordinarily granted, unless there be any valid objection, and remains in force for one working season only. Clause 10, section XX. 11. In February and March the supervisor or one of his three assistants visits each manufacturing yard or chatter as often as possible to take note of the outturn, and to see that the drug as manufactured is forwarded to the public gola or stored in some secure authorized place in the premises of the cultivators, or of such wholesale dealers as purchase the standing crop and prepare their own drug. Clause 11, section XX. Clause 12, section XX. 12. The manufacturer of the drug, whether a cultivator or a wholesale goladar, is bound to give notice three days before he commences to cut his crop to the supervisor or to an assistant supervisor; the rule also requires him to send into the public gola all the ganja he manufactures, unless he has a secure private place of his own. But hitherto the rule regarding storage in the public gola has not been enforced owing to practical difficulties, and the cultivators have been permitted to keep the manufactured drug in their own houses. A cultivator has to obtain a license from the supervisor to retain ganja in his own private gola until it is disposed of to a licensed purchaser. This license shows the quantity and the kind of ganja covered by it, and has to be returned to the supervisor endorsed with the names of the purchasers to whom the ganja may subsequently be sold, and the quan- tity sold to each. Clause 14, section XX. Clause 25, section XX. 13. A cultivator may sell his standing crop to a duly licensed wholesale purchaser, but not without the written sanction of the supervisor of ganja cultivation. Every purchaser licensed to purchase ganja for export is bound to keep for the inspection of the super- visor, or other excise officer, a statement of his purchases and sales on pain of forfeiture of his license. 14. Owing to the area within which cultivation is permitted being extremely limited, and to the close supervision exercised there, there is every reason to believe that unlicensed cultiva- tion has been all but suppressed. The manufacture of the drug entails a series of elaborate processes, and cannot be successfully carried on in secret, at all events to any appreciable ex- tent, and it may be safely affirmed that the manufacture of ganja is now confined in these provinces to the very limited tract which has been specially set apart for the purpose. Iso- lated cases of one or two plants being grown in the inner courtyards of houses are occasionally detected, but these only show how effectually unlicensed cultivation has been put down. 15. But much remains to be done to bring the manufacture of the drug, and more especi- ally its storage in private houses, under more effective control than is exercised at present. Manufacture begins almost simultaneously in every part of the tract, and it is physically im- possible for the limited excise staff to visit the chatters or manufacturing yards with sufficient frequency and to check the outturn.
BENGAL MEMORANDUM. 5 16. Again there is no Government monopoly in ganja as there is in opium, and Govern- ment is not concerned with either the wholesale or the retail trade beyond seeing that the drug pays duty before passing into consumption. The difficulty of having a public warehouse is that the ganja stored in it would consist of numerous small parcels, all belonging to different individuals, and this would lead to much confusion. Again, the drug has to be frequently aired, turned, and handled in order to keep it in good condition, and it is next to impossible to secure this periodical examination when the ganja is stored in public golas situated at a distance from the houses of the cultivators. It is mainly owing to these difficulties that cultivators have so long been allowed to keep the ganja in their own houses, but the so-called private golas are often mere open sheds, and are not the secure warehouses that the rules contemplate. A properly built gola would be beyond the means of the average cultivator. But even with suitable buildings there would be no security unless one key remained with a Government offi- cial, whose presence would then be necessary every time the gola had to be opened. 17. The present system of storage is admittedly defective, and it cannot be denied that some ganja is smuggled or otherwise illicitly disposed of. But owing to the comparatively bulky nature of the drug there is reason to think that the extent of smuggling is not large. The small number of cases detected also point to the same conclusion. The privilege of grow- ing ganja is valued, and the cultivators, who are generally well-to-do men, are averse to doing anything that may cause forfeiture of their licenses, not to speak of other penalties; and it is the general opinion of those who have any experience of the ganja tract that the cultivators as a class honestly and faithfully carry out the engagements. 18. Garhjat ganja, as its name implies, comes from the Garhjat or Tributary States of Orissa, and is in use only in the three districts of the Orissa Division. Its cultivation and manufacture is apparently under no control. Small quantities of Garhjat ganja are imported into Puri under excise rules, but more is smuggled there as well as in the other two districts, the extended frontier and the jungly nature of the country affording great facilities for such illicit dealings and rendering detection extremely difficult. 19. The resin from which charas is manufactured is not produced in abundance in the plant in Bengal, and charas is not made here. It is obtained from Amritsar and Mirzapur, where again it is imported from Yarkand and other places in Central Asia. Charas used at one time to be imported from Nepal also, but the trade has apparently died out. 20. The importers of ganja and other hemp drugs are the wholesale dealers of those drugs. They are licensed. Excise Manual, clause 27, section XX. Clause 28, section XX. Clause 29, section XX. As regards ganja the following procedure is observed:6 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. Clause 33, section XX. Collector of the importing district. Any ganja found on weighment by the supervisor to be in excess of the quantity entered in the import pass is kept in the public gola and warehouse, a rent of Re. 1 per maund being charged for the first month, and 4 annas per maund for subsequent months. This quantity is not allowed to be exported without a fresh import pass, but the cultivator may sell the same to other goladars. Clause 6, section XIX. Clause 7, section XIX. Clause 8, section XIX.

After crossing the British frontier, the importer is bound to take the con- signment to the first police-station for inspection. The im- porter is not authorized to make sales during the journey, and any police or excise officer may challenge and examine consignments during transit. The rules as to storage and levy of duty on Rajshahi ganja apply mutatis mutandisto Garhjat ganja. Any vendor licensed to retail Rajshahi ganja may sell Garhjat ganja under the same license. 23. Both the wholesale and retail dealers are under control and are licensed. The wholesale licenses are granted free and the retail licenses are annually sold by auction. Clause 43, section XX, Excise Manual. Clause 51, section XX. Clauses 52 and 53, section XX. Clause 55, section XX. 24. Before ganja is allowed to be stored in a warehouse the Excise Deputy Collector of the importing district, or where the gola is situated in a sub-divi- sion, the sub-divisional officer, is required to ascertain by per- sonal inspection of the consignment that the seals of the bales or bags are unbroken, and that the weight and sorts correspond with the weight and sorts noted on the pass given in the producing district. He opens some of the bags, and having ascertained that they contain flat, round, or choor ganja as invoiced, reseals them. He examines the general quality and the condition in which the drug is received, whether dry or damp or in process of de- terioration or decay. If any of the particulars do not agree with the entries in the pass under which the ganja is imported, the circumstance is reported to the Collector. The full duty, at the rate chargeable on the sort of ganja in which the deficiency or defect is found, is at once levied on any deficiency of weight and on any broken bundles. Any bale or bag received without the original seal may, if the Collector thinks fit, be confiscated. A wholesale dealer can sell ganja only to another duly author- ized wholesale dealer, or to a retail dealer duly licensed. Stock is taken annually in each ganja and siddhi warehouse between the 25th and 31st March at the head-quarters of the district by the Excise Deputy Collector, and at the sub-divisions by the sub-divisional officer. The ganja and the siddhi goladars are held responsible for any deficiency in excess of 21/2 per cent., and duty is levied on such excess on or before the 31st March of each year. Each warehouse is secured by two reliable locks, the key of one of which remains with the goladar, and that of the other with the officer in charge of the warehouse. No gola can, therefore, be opened except in the joint presence of the goladar and the officer in charge. Clause 5, section XXI. 25. Every importer of charas is bound to keep an account of the quantity received and expended, and if he wishes to dispose of the drug to the public, he must take out a separate license for retail vend. Clause 75, section XX. (Vide forms of licenses Nos. 63, 116, and 124, pages 267, 312, and 318, re- spectively of the Manual.) 26. Ganja and siddhi golas are liable to periodical inspection by the Collector, the Ex- cise Deputy Collector, and the sub-divisional officer. The inspecting officer is required to test the stock in hand and to examine the ganja registers and the treasury receipts to ascertain that the duty has been properly levied on all ganja issued, and finally that the collections have been duly credited to Government. 27. Retail licensees are bound to act according to the excise law and rules, and licenses are granted to them under certain conditions, which they must observe on pain of forfeiting the license. 28. Retail shops are also liable to inspection by Excise officers. Retail vendors pay duty according to the prescribed scale at the time of obtaining their supplies from the golas, and the drug is issued in the presence of a responsible officer (generally a gazetted officer), and the consignment is protected by a pass during its transit from the gola to the licensed shop. 29. The excise revenue from ganja and other hemp drugs is levied in two ways, viz., (1) in the form of license fees, and (2) in the form of duty at a fixed rate per seer on the quantity issued for retail vend.

In the event of the upset price not being obtained in any particular case, a lower offer may be accepted with the sanction of the Commissioner. A sum equivalent to the fee for two months is taken at the time of sale as advance fees, and one month's fee is paid on the date on which the currency of the license- commences, and one month's fee on the first day of every succeeding month until the whole of the fee due on the license has been realized. In cases of siddhi, charas, and majum (a sweet preparation of siddhi) shops, however, only one month's fee is taken in advance. A brief account of the earlier laws and rules for regulating the sale of hemp drugs is given in Appendix A. 31.

As regards sites local opinion is not formally consulted, but attention is paid to any reasonable objection raised against any particular site, though most of the sites being old ones, it is seldom that they are objected to. Moreover, shops for the sale of hemp-drugs are not considered a nuisance, and are often accommodated in the same room where other business is carried on. 41. No rate is fixed at which any of the hemp-drugs must be supplied by wholesale to retail vendors. The retail price of each of the drugs varies considerably in different districts. The average retail price of each is shown below:BENGAL MEMORANDUM. 11 to check it; in fact none could be effectively taken, regard being had to the length of the frontier to be guarded. Various attempts have from time to time been made to stop smuggling from the Garbjat and with varying success. The chief difficulty lies in bringing the excise administration of these petty States under some sort of control. Some of them are now under the direct management of Government, owing to the minority of the Chiefs or other causes, and it is in contemplation to make a beginning with them. In 1878 cultivation of ganja was prohibited within three miles of the frontier, and this was followed by a considerable increase in the consumption of the Rajshahi drug in all the three districts. The order was withdrawn in 1889, and consumption has since decreased consider- ably in Cuttack, though this result is not so apparent in Balasore or Puri. At one time the importation of Garhjat ganja or siddhi was entirely forbidden (videnotification of 21st June 1882), but this is now allowed (vide notification of 23rd March 1892) under separate rules framed for the purpose, though little advantage has yet been taken of them to import the Garhjat drug. With a view specially to prevent smuggling, the limit of possession of Garhjat ganja has been experimentally reduced to 5 tolas. 45. Arrests for illicit cultivation were made in 25 districts, but all the cases were for growing a few plants (very often only a single plant) in the courtyards of houses more for the purpose of using the leaves as bhang than for manufacturing ganja, and the fact that not a single case occurred in Dinajpur, and only one in each of the districts of Rajshahi and Bogra, shows clearly that unlicensed cultivation for the manufacture of ganja is all but unknown even in the ganja tract. 46. Similarly, cases of unlicensed sale of ganja, though comparatively numerous, general- ly represent sales of the excised drug by petty dealers who obtained their supplies from licensed vendors, and are often the outcome of the licensed shops being too few to supply the local demand, or, in other words, these unlicensed men distribute the drug to a larger circle of consumers. This is particularly the case in the Dacca Division, where the consumption of ganja is large and where nearly a third of the arrests were made. 47. Nearly half the arrests for illicit possession were made in the Rajshahi Division, and of these all but two occurred in the three ganja-growing districts. In these cases the ganja was doubtless obtained clandestinely from the cultivators, but the quantities seized were not large. 48. It may be said generally that, except in Orissa, where there is smuggling of Garhjat ganja, in some of the north Gangetic districts, where Nepal ganja is introduced, and in the immediate neighbourhood of the ganja tract, where there is some consumption of untaxed ganja, in the rest of the province most of the drug consumed has paid duty, and that the majority of the cases of illicit cultivation and unlicensed sale do not mean any serious threat to the revenue. The police and the excise detective staff are encouraged in their efforts to put down excise offences by the grant of liberal rewards in all important cases of seizure. 49. No material modifications of the present system are actually under consideration at the present moment. The question of bringing the excise of the bordering Garhjat States in Orissa under some control so as to protect our own revenue, more especially with reference to the smuggling of Garhjat ganja, has been for some time under consideration. 50.

Board's Excise Administration Report for the year 1878-79, from which extracts are given below, that ganja was actually imported during that year from Bombay and the Central Provinces:BENGAL MEMORANDUM. 13 The great increase in the consumption of bhang is more apparent than real, and is due to larger use of the duty-paid drug. 60. The importance of hemp-drugs in these provinces will be apparent from the fact that out of a total excise revenue of 115 lakhs in 1892-93, ganja and its congeners con- tributed 241/4 lakhs, or about 21 per cent., and occupy the second place, being next only to country spirits. Of the four varieties that are taxed, ganja, bhang, charas, and majum, ganja alone yielded more than 233/4 lakhs. The revenue from majum, a sweet preparation of bhang in the form of confection, is insignificant, being under Rs. 2,000. The consumption of majum is practically confined to Calcutta, Patna, and Cuttack. The revenue from charas was under Rs. 10,000. It is consumed in the urban areas of a few districts in Central and West- ern Bengal. The revenue from bhang exceeded half a lakh. Its consumption is general, and the quantity (1,034 maunds) that paid duty represents but a small fraction of what was illicitly consumed. 61. The cultivation and manufacture of Rajshahi ganja that not only supplies the Lower Provinces, but is also exported to Assam, Nepal, North-Western Provinces, &c., is confined to a small well-marked area. It is a paying crop, and a year of good prices usually leads to extended cultivation in the next. From the time the drug is brought to the Naogaon head office, to be weighed, packed, and despatched to the consuming districts, the safeguards against fraud provided by the existing rules appear to be ample, and it may be safely affirmed that there is little room for evasion of duty during transit or in the subsequent stages, includ- ing storage in golas, issue to retail vendors and sale to consumers. There is likewise good reason to think that there is no unlicensed cultivation, and that no ganja is made for the market outside the recognized tract. 62. The weak points of the system may be said to be all connected with the process of manufacture and the storage of the drug in private golas prior to disposal to wholesale dealers. Manufacture begins simultaneously at different places, and its progress is not watched as closely as it ought to be. The outturn is not checked then and there, but a rough estimate is subsequently made by merely counting the number of bundles of each sort, which can hardly supply the place of an accurate weighment. Then the drug is stored in private houses, in mere sheds which are sometimes open and always insecure, and there is ample opportunity for petty pilfering by outsiders, even supposing the cultivators were all above suspicion. 63. The difficulty of working a scheme of public golas without a Government monopoly has been adverted to under section (c). In the case of opium the cultivator sells his produce outright to Government at a fixed price and has no further concern with it. The entire quantity purchased from the different cultivators is dealt with as one stock. In the case of ganja, however, the drug remains the cultivator's property and in his charge until he dis- poses of it to a licensed purchaser. It has therefore been found impracticable to introduce public warehouses where all the drug could be stored immediately after manufacture. In view of the attacks made against the Government monopoly in opium, it is not likely that any proposal to establish a similar monopoly in ganja would be received with favour. But with a larger establishment the existing checks on manufacture might be rendered more effective. 64. Four sorts of ganja are now made, flat large twigs, flat small twigs, round, and choor, and these distinctions are observed for the levy of duty and for the purposes of the wholesale trade but no twigs or woody matter are taken by the retail purchaser, and for retail sale the other varieties are also reduced to choor by the retail vendor. It would therefore be a good plan to have only one sort and abolish flat and round. Particular localities are said to favour par- ticular sorts, but the fact that the consumption of choor increased very largely (from 424 maunds to 1,369 maunds) during the past year owing to the discovery that it was more lightly taxed in proportion to the amount of narcotic matter present in it, would seem to show that there can be no great objection to its general adoption. To the wholesale dealer this would reduce cost of carriage and save storage room; to Government it would simplify accounts, and remove all chances of fraud to revenue for which differential rates afford some room. 65. The cost of daily average allowance of ganja is 3 to 6 pies, while the cost of liquor to the habitual consumer is much higher. The cost of liquor is almost prohibitive to the poorer classes in Eastern and Central Bengal, but even in Bihar, where liquor is cheap, the daily cost is seldom less than 9 to 12 pies. In this view ganja may be said to be insufficiently taxed. Competition, however, is annually raising the license fees, and the duty is also enhanced from time to time. 66. Under the present system the wholesale dealers (goladars) make very large profits in some districts. They pay no license fees and combine to create a monopoly. It would per- haps be a better plan to recognize the monopoly, but to obviate its evil effects by fixing a maximum price for sales to retail vendors. Government might also appropriate a portion of the profits by giving the wholesale license for a given area to the person who agreed to pay the largest amount for each seer sold, in addition to the duty.

16 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. APPENDIX A. (SEE PARAGRAPH 30 OF MEMORANDUM.) Brief historical sketch of the modes of taxation of ganja. Earliest rules. It will appear from paragraph 1, section XI of Harrington's Analysis, Vol. III (1817), that with a view to check immoderate consumption, and at the same time to augment the public revenue, it was judged expedient to continue and extend the duties levied on liquors and drugs, when the sayer collec- tions were resumed from the landlords in the year 1790. Rules and orders were accordingly issued from time to time which were subsequently enacted with modifications in Regulation XXXIV, 1793, as regards the Lower Provinces. It was enjoined in section XVIII of this Regulation that "no person shall manufacture or vend any such drugs ('bhang, ganja, charas, and other intoxicating drugs') without a license from the Collector of the zillah." Daily rates of license fees. 2. In section II of Regulation VI of 1800 the following daily rates of duty on the sale of intoxicating drugs were laid down:BENGAL MEMORANDUM. 17 "20. Ganja vendors, who are unable to dispose, within the month, of the whole quantity of ganja to which their jama entitles them, may be permitted to draw the balance in the succeeding month without further payment of duty." Combined duty and fixed monthly license-fee system. 7. The fixed duty system continued up to 1860-61, or for about seven years, when a fixed fee of Rs. 4 per mensem was prescribed for each ganja license in addition to the duty at the prescribed rate on all quantities passed to the shop for retail sale, the previous rule regarding the quantity to be taken by each shop being at the same time withdrawn. A revised form of ganja license, necessitated by these changes, was issued with the Board's circular order No. 26 of 1st June 1860. Summary. 8. Thus there was a daily tax system from 1790 to 1853 (with farming system from 1824), fixed duty system from 1853 to 1860, fixed license-fee and duty system from 1860 to 1876, when the present system came into force. 5
18 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. ASSAM MEMORANDUM. Both cultivated and wild hemp are consumed in this province. The cultivated hemp is entirely imported from Rajshahi in the form of flat, round, choor ganja by licensed wholesale vendors, who place the drug in registered warehouses, and the duty is paid by retail vendors when the ganja is taken from the registered warehouses. The vend of charas and bhang is at the present moment forbidden in Assam, no licenses having been taken out. The use and sale of wild hemp as an intoxicant is forbidden. But the possession of wild hemp as a medi- cine for cattle is permitted by a circular issued in 1882, a copy of which is enclosed. The wild plant grows freely in all parts of the province and especially in the hill tracts by dwellers in which it is illicitly sold in small quantities to the neighbouring plains people. It is also grown in the Bhutan Hills and is sold privily in small quantities when the Bhutias come down to trade in the cold weather. Similarly, men from Independent Tipperah sell the wild plant to the inhabitants of Sylhet. No pains are taken, it is believed, to extirpate the male plants by people who deal in wild hemp, of which the leaves and stalks as well as the flowers are sold. There is nothing to show that the trade in the wild plant is sufficiently large to compete seriously with excise ganja, unless possibly in the Khasi Hills, where the continuous decrease in the consumption of the Rajshahi drug can, I think, only be attributed to the cheap- ness of wild hemp, and the great facilities for its use. But the excise administration of this district is attended by abnormal difficulties owing to the fact that the Khasi Hills are parcelled out into the territories of many semi-independent Chiefs. On the whole, the consumption of wild hemp is small, is effectually checked by prosecutions from time to time, and cannot, I think, be checked in any other way. The wild plant is used by habitual consumers only as a pis aller, and when their supply of the excise ganja runs short. I do not think any more need be said about the wild plant. 2. With regard to excise ganja, we only use the three varieties above mentioned, and in our dealings with them are entirely guided by the excise system of the neighbouring province of Bengal. All our excise ganja comes to us from Bengal, and is dealt with in accordance with the Bengal Board of Revenue's Excise Manual. The three districts of Sylhet, Cachar, and Goalpara, in the matter of ganja consumption, entirely resemble the adjacent Bengal districts of Mymensing, Tipperah, and Rangpur. In the five districts of Assam proper, name- ly, Kamrup, Darrang, Nowgong, Sibsagar, and Lakhimpur, and in the three hill districts, namely, the Garo, Khasi, and Naga Hills, ganja is consumed chiefly by foreigners. The inha- bitants of the first five districts are perhaps the largest consumers of opium in India; and in spite of the great decrease of opium shops, and the enormous increase in retail prices which our excise system has brought about, ganja has not, to any considerable extent, taken the place of opium. But these five districts contain about half the tea gardens of the province, and consequently possess a large immigrant populationASSAM MEMORANDUM. 19 vendor desires to remove ganja from a registered warehouse, he pays the requisite amount of duty into the Treasury and receives a pass (without fee) which enables him to take the necessary supply of drug from the warehouse to his shop. The warehouses are usually small constructions of wood, lined with tin. In rare cases they are made of masonry. Transport is allowed from one warehouse to another under the cover of passes issued by the Deputy Commissioner. (e) The number of wholesale vendors in a district is fixed by the Commissioner of Excise in accordance with local requirements. That is, new licenses are not given without careful enquiry, and without ascertaining that the existing licensed vendors are not sufficient in number to carry on the business of impor- tation. An excess in the number of wholesale vendors might lead to an undue cheapening of the drug or to smuggling. In Sylhet, the most populous dis- trict in the province, there are 17 vendors. In the Assam Valley the largest number is in Kamrup, namely, 9. But the licensed vendors of several other districts draw their supply from Kamrup. The retail vendors are all licensed; they have to pay their license fees monthly in advance, two months' fees being paid at the date of sale. They are compelled to keep accounts of all purchases and sales of the drug. These are carefully scrutinized from time to time by Magistrates and Police officers, who can demand the immediate pro- duction of the license and accounts at any time. (f) The tax on ganja consists of (1) duty collected as above, (2) and license fee paid monthly as above. Payment of duty can only be evaded by the collusion of the Excise Officer. (g) The number and sites of retail shops are fixed by the Commissioner of Excise in consultation with the district authorities, who endeavour, as far as is possible by personal enquiries, and by consulting the police, mauzadars, &c., to discover the wishes of the people of the locality. An upset price is fixed on the average fees paid during the previous three years. Experience shows that a minimum upset price is a good guide to local demand. Statement appended gives the number of shops to population. The population varies so enormously in proportion to area in different parts of Assam, that it is impossible to make area a factor in fixing sites for shops. Shops are com- monly placed in bazar and other centres of trade, and the vendors usually deal in other commodities, such as spices, &c. Complaints as to the location of ganja shops are carefully considered, but very rarely occur. Complaints by people living near spirit shops and specially by European planters are com- paratively common. Ostensibly we have no local option, except as above described, that, as a matter of fact, if the people of any locality objected to, or desired the opening of a new shop, they would not hesitate to make their wish known to the district officials, or, if necessary, to the Commissioner of Excise. In the case of ganja, such references are extremely rare. In the hill districts and Assam proper, the shops are few and far between; in Sylhet and Cachar the number has been largely reduced of late years, and the only doubt possible is whether the reduction has not been too great. In 1890-91 the retail shops in Sylhet were reduced from 148 to 110, and in Cachar from 52 to 42. No complaints were made by the general public. (h) No rate is fixed at which the drug is to be supplied by wholesale to the retail vendors. The rate is fixed by competition, and if the wholesale vendors of one district attempt to force the price too high, retail vendors have recourse to the "golahs" of a neighbouring district. In many cases the wholesale vendors also hold retail shops. The average retail price to consumers, district by dis- trict, is given below for the past two years. The circumstances which affect the retail price have already been stated:20 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. considered necessary to defeat a practice which is carried on on a very small scale. We occasionally get information (for which rewards are paid by the Deputy Commissioners) from retail vendors and others. (k) No modifications of the excise system with reference to hemp drugs are under the consideration of the local Government. (l) The statement called for by the Commission is appended hereto. I add some expla- nations of the more important variations in consumption from year to year. In 1874-75 there was a decrease in consumption in Cachar owing to a combination among the wholesale vendors to raise the price. In the following year a similar cause produced similar effects in Sylhet, while the breaking up of the combination in Cachar led to a reduction in retail prices and increased consumption. In 1876-77 the combination in Sylhet continued and resulted in a further decrease in consumption, while in Cachar, Goalpara, and Kamrup the whole district was farmed out to a monopolist, who found his profit in charging high prices, which checked consumption. In 1877-78 the consumption in Sylhet increased owing to the breaking up of the com- bination among the goladars and a consequent fall in retail prices. The increase in Goalpara was attributed by the district authorities to the fact that opium had become too costly for common use and that people were taking to ganja instead. This was probably a mere guess, and does not appear in the explanations of subsequent years. In fact, careful inquiries have since shown that ganja is not taking the place of opium. In 1878-79 there was an increase of the rate of duty in Sylhet alone, and this was followed by a large decrease in the amount of ganja taken from the district shops. Strange to say, however, there was also a decrease in the neighbouring district of Cachar, where the rate of duty was not enhanced till the following year. In Cachar the diminution was attributed to the high rates charged by the wholesale vendors in anticipation of an enhanced duty. In 1879-80 when the enhanced rate of duty was extended to the whole province, an increased consumption of about three maunds in each case occurred in Sylhet and Cachar. There was a decrease in all the remaining districts, and especially in Goalpara, where the season was a bad one, and the price of food-grain was high. In the next two years consumption remained pretty steady. In 1883-84 there was a somewhat large increase of 581/2 maunds. This was chiefly due to the breaking up of the monopoly in Cachar, which resulted in a reduc- tion of retail prices. In Kamrup there was an increase of over 16 maunds, but, as above explained, many districts (Darrang, Nowgong, the Khasi Hills, &c.) draw their supply from this district. In Sylhet there was a falling off of over 19 maunds, but no doubt many consumers drew their supply from Cachar. In 1885-86 there was a very large decrease in consumption, entirely due to the decrease in the Sylhet district attended as before by an increase in Cachar. In the following year the pendulum swung backwards, and in Sylhet and Kamrup, which had shown a large falling off in 1885-86, there was an increase in con- sumption. This, as before, was no doubt due to the breaking up of combina- tion among the wholesale vendors. In 1887-88 there was again a decrease in Sylhet and Cachar, in the former district amounting to as much as 73 maunds. The year was one of scarcity and high prices, but an increase in prices and decreased consumption would probably have occurred in any case. In Lakhimpur the rapid increase of the immigrant popu- lation induced the Commissioner to authorize the opening of a second registered warehouse (there had only been one heretofore). This appears to have led to a fall in retail prices and a small (temporary) increase in consumption. In 1888-89 Sylhet and Cachar again show an increase between them of some 71 maunds. The year was a good one from an agricultural point of view, and probably the anticipation of good sales brought about the breaking up of the combination among wholesale vendors. Moreover, the increase in this year was less than appears at the first sight. The duty on choor and round ganja was raised; that on flat ganja remained the same. This stimulated the consumption of flat ganja, which consists largely of stalks and stems. In 1889-90 the increased consumption continued, the year being again one of good har- vests. So also in 1890-91, in which year the consumption in Cachar was greatly stimulated by the influx of foreigners in connection with the Lushai expedition. In 1891-92 the decrease of 27 maunds odd was chiefly due to the partial failure of the crop in Rajshahi, which raised the wholesale price of the drug; nor was the quantity required available for import. The decrease of nearly 80 maunds in 1892-93 occurred almost entirely in the district of Cachar, and was due to the fact that the whole district was leased to a mono- polist. In other districts the decrease was more apparent than real, owing to an increased resort to the use of round and choor ganja in preference to flat ganja. (m) As I have already pointed out at length, our system of administering ganja is derived from, and carried on, in conformity with the Bengal system. It would
ASSAM MEMORANDUM. 21 be possible for us to vend ganja in the same way as we now vend opium. To take this step would give us an increased hold over the vendors, and a possibi- lity of influencing retail prices more effectually than at present. The experi- ment is in fact being tried on a small scale in the Khasi Hills. But to adopt it for the province at large, we should require the co-operation of the Bengal Government. Probably the introduction of a similar system in Bengal would be necessary. With regard to opium the system, as is well known, is for Government to buy the opium from the cultivators, and to sell it directly after manufacture to the retail vendors. Whether such a system can profitably be applied to ganja is probably best known to the authorities in Rajshahi. In practice the present system works fairly well: all reasonable facilities for the sale of the drug are given, while it cannot be said that the number of shops is such as to create an artificial demand for ganja. The one drawback of the system lies in the violent vacillations in retail prices due to the forming and breaking up of the combinations among the wholesale vendors.

[APP. NORTH-WESTERN PROVINCES AND OUDH MEMORANDUM. 1. It will be convenient to first describe the kinds of hemp drugs in use in these pro- vinces: then to indicate the sources of supply, dealing separately withNORTH-WESTERN PROVINCES AND OUDH MEMORANDUM. 25 substances. It is chiefly consumed in the western districts where ganja is at present unknown. These are the districts which lie nearest the Punjab, whence most of the supply comes. Charas is also consumed more or less extensively in the central districts and is making its way in the east. I attribute this to the constantly increasing price of the Bengal ganja, which was once almost exclusively used there. Now, however, it has to compete with the cheaper "pathar" ganja, which will be described later on. Practically speaking, I should say its use is exclusively confined to the lower classes of society. Its effects are much the same as those of ganja, with which it seems to be physiologically related. It is used for the same purpose and by the same classes of people. I should be slow to dogmatize on the point, but my observations lead me to believe that charas is the most injurious and least reputable of all the hemp drugs, possibly because it may contain the active principle of the plant in the most concentrated form. There are indications that where spirits or opium are supplanted by hemp, charas is the sort of drug usually selected. Its use appears to be extending at the expense of other intoxicants. Its price fluctuates considerably probably in accordance with the condi- tions of Central Asiatic trade. For the last few years it has been comparatively cheap, while under our system of administration country spirits and opium have been becoming dearer. Charas is always smoked. LOCAL GROWTH AND MANUFACTURE. 8. Turning now to the question of growth and manufacture. The hemp plant grows in all parts of the provinces, but in varying quantities. It grows absolutely wild in great profusion in all the montane and sub-montane districts. I place in this category26 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. 11. In the Himalayan districts the plant is cultivated and yields fibre which is of some economic importance. It supplies the people with material for their cloth and cordage, and was once a valuable monopoly of the East India Company. In most cases the plant is grown primarily for the fibre, and charas is gained as a subsidiary product. But in some places the charas is said to be the primary object of the cultivation. So far as I can discover, fibre is nowhere extracted from the plant grown in the plains. In some localities, where it grows wild, the stalks are utilized for making thatches, screens, &c. 12. Where grown for fibre in the hills, the plant is sown in the best soil and receives careful cultivation. But both in hills and plains it can and does grow without any care or cultivation of a sufficiently good quality to yield drugs. The brief and material conclusion is that besides a very large and general spontaneous growth, wherever people choose to grow the hemp plant, they can and do grow it in any part of the provinces, and it can be grown under conditions where suppression would be impossible. 13. Under the rules now in force under section 11, Excise Act XXII, 1881, the cultiva- tion of the hemp plant in these provinces is free to all parties. The possession of the drug is permitted to cultivators, to owners of laud in which the plant grows spontaneously, to licensed vendors or to persons duly authorized to supply licensed vendors. Its possession by other persons in larger quantities than one quarter of a seer of bhang and five tolas of ganja or charas, is prohibited under sections 22 and 23, clause (k), Excise Act. Section 12 (d) permits any cultivator to sell intoxicating drugs prepared from his plants to any person licensed to sell drugs or specially authorized to purchase the same. This permission to cultivators is considered to extend to the sale of their bhang by owners of spontaneous produce. Bhang requires no preparation or manufacture, being only the dried plant stripped of its stalk. The rules are silent on the subject of manufacture or preparation of drugs. This is probably because outside the hill districts there has hitherto really been no manufacture or preparation in the proper sense of the word carried on in the provinces except a little quasi- surreptitious manufacture of ganja which will be noticed further on. Excepting the wholesale contractor in Saharanpur, no persons are specially authorized to purchase under section 12 (d).The business is entirely in the hands of the contractors, who are licensed to sell. 14. In the few cases abovementioned, where the plant is cultivated, the produce is stored by cultivators themselves in their own houses. It is sold to contractors, and when bought for export, is weighed and sealed before the tahsil officials, and exported under pass in the usual way (hereafter described). The produce of the wild plant is similarly treated. The real control lies in the restrictions on sale and transport. But the rules governing cultivation, collection of wild plant, preparation and manufacture, are, I think, susceptible of improvement. So far the rules, however, have worked well enough, partly because the supply of drugs has been ample and cheap and partly because the people generally have not known or realized how far they might go without violating the law and rules. They see that all excisable commodi- ties are a Government monopoly, and, except where hemp is cultivated or collected for sale, they have a belief that its cultivation would render them liable to penalties. The ignorance is shared by some of the officials, who occasionally take cognizance of cases where a few plants are found growing in or about a man's house. In such cases he never pleads that he is entitled to grow them; he always denies the fact or alleges that the plants grew spontaneously without his knowledge. If drugs were forbidden or made prohibitive in price the case would at once alter, cultivation, collection, and manufacture would have to be placed under such control and restriction as might be found possible. 15. The question of manufacture as well as growth of bhang has, perhaps, been sufficiently explained in the foregoing paragraphs. In the case of ganja the manufacture and growth cannot well be separated. The hemp plant, as I have stated, can be, and is grown everywhere, but the production of good ganja requires either the extirpation of the male plant or the isolation of the female plant. The regular cultivation of ganja in this way is not carried on openly anywhere in these provinces. The whole of the ganja offered for public sale is import- ed. At the same time it would be incorrect to say that ganja is nowhere grown or manu- factured. Careful enquiry has elicited reports from several districts that a small amount of ganja is surreptitiously made. I have endeavoured to verify this by obtaining specimens of the local manufacture. It is naturally difficult to obtain a clandestine article, but I have succeeded in getting specimens from Ghazipur and Sultanpur, which have been handed over to the Commission. In appearance the Ghazipur ganja is better than the ordinary "pathar," and not much inferior to Bengal "baluchar" (flat). The other is much the same as " pathar." I hope to obtain further specimens which will be duly submitted. These two samples are clearly made from unfertilized flowers, and the people who made them knew the necessity of preventing fertilization. In Ghazipur the male plants are extirpated and the ganja is pre- pared from the female flower by a process which closely resembles that employed in Bengal. It sells, I am informed, for two annas per tola. The method of cultivation and manufacture in Sultanpur has not been described. 16. The deduction is significant and instructive. Ganja, of fair or good quality, can be made, and is made, locally. People understand the principle of its manufacture. If this
NORTH-WESTERN PROVINCES AND OUDH MEMORANDUM. 27 happens in a few districts, it may happen in any district. There can be no doubt it would happen very generally if the import of ganja were prohibited. The distinction between the male and female plants is everywhere recognized (though the names are sometimes transposed), and it is generally known that the latter yields ganja and the former bhang only. But as yet it is not everywhere or generally known that proper ganja can only be made from the unfertilized flower. Such knowledge, however, would soon spread. Ganja of a certain sort is also made in Nepal territory, and there is reason to believe in the adjoining parts of this territory. It is introduced by Nepalese who come down for one reason or another and who primarily bring it for their own use, but possibly also do a little trade in it. I will submit a specimen which was procured by the Collector of Basti from a fakir who wanders in and out of Nepal and could not clearly say on which side of the frontier it was grown. The ganja is no doubt very inferior, but compared with the purely wild female plant it seems to me to indicate some preparation from a plant specially grown or tended. 17. Besides these cases it has also been ascertained that wild ganja is collected and used in the Kheri district. I have procured a specimen of this and submitted it to the Commission. It is simply the unprepared flower of the wild female plant fertilized and fructifying. The Deputy Commissioner reports that the people do not understand the necessity for keeping the flower barren. This stuff is locally smoked as ganja, but it is recognized to be of very inferior quality and has no commercial value. In Bara Banki also the wild female plant is collected and smoked under the name of ganja. The specimens indicate an absence of any form of special cultivation or manufacture. There are indications that wild ganja is similarly used in other districts, but the matter is not certain, and I have seen no specimens. The Kheri experience shows that the produce of even the wild plant can be used as ganja at a pinch, and raises an inference that ordinary bhang could be smoked if ganja were not procurable. 18. The hemp plant is cultivated for its fibre in the Almora and Garhwal districts, and yields charas generally as a subsidiary product. Some description of the process will be found in the North-Western Provinces Gazetteer, Volume X, pages 760 and seq and 799 and seq.The information now supplied to me by the local authorities and gained by my own enquiries shows that the charas is extracted by rubbing in the hands the flowers of the female plant after it has been cut and scraping off the resin which adheres to them. A certain amount is also said to stick to the hands when the stalk is manipulated for preparation of the fibre, but this requires confirmation. No intentional effort seems to be made to keep the female plant from being fertilized, but the male plant matures a month or six weeks before the female plant, and is then cut to prevent deterioration of the fibre. Where the primary object of the cultivation is charas, the male plant is similarly removed to give the female room to spread. This practice may act to check fertilization, but obviously does not prevent it, as the female plants are said to always produce seed. Moreover, the wild plant grows round about and presumably its pollen would fertilize the cultivated plant. Charas is also extracted from the female flowers of the wild plant which must of course be fully fertilized. Such charas is esteemed to be of inferior quality. In a letter from the Political Agent and Superintendent of the Punjab Hill States it is said that in Bashahr a resin is extracted from the terminal leaves of the wild female plant by rubbing them between the palms of the hands till the resin adheres. It is then scraped off and smoked like charas. Each man makes his own in this fashion. This private manufacture of the drug in a small way is common. This account agrees exactly with the description given of the preparation of charas in the hill districts of these provinces and in Native Garhwal. Charas, which is a resinous secretion of the female flower, would seem scarcely distinguishable in its properties and effects from ganja, which is the female flower with its resinous secretion still present. IMPORTS AND EXPORTS. 19. The imports of bhang may be very briefly stated. Nearly the whole of the bhang consumed here is grown in the provinces. A certain amount is imported from the Punjab, coming chiefly from Jagadhri, Kalsia, Umballa, and some from Amritsar, Hosbiyarpur. Nearly all of it goes to a few of our western districts. This is not because of any failure in the local supply which is unlimited and inexhaustible, nor because of any superiority of the Punjab article, but apparently on account of the trade connection of some of the contractors with the Punjab. These imports are made under pass in the manner prescribed in rule 98, Chapter X, of the North-Western Provinces Excise Manual. No import duty is levied. A little bhang also occasionally comes from Bhartpur and Jeypur and perhaps from a few Bundel- khand Native States, but in that direction we give more than we get. The amount is not considerable and seems to be diminishing. Some of the bhang from Gonda and Bahraich is really grown on the Nepal side of the border. The Nepalese officials are said to exact a trifling duty of one or two annas per maund. The plant is treated in the same way as the growth of our own villages. A certain amount of bhang finds its way out of the provinces to the neighbouring districts of Bengal, the Punjab, the Central Provinces, and the Bundelkhand States.
28 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. 20. The chief districts from which bhang is exported are Gonda, Gorakhpur, Bahraich, Basti, and Kheri, the Tarai (Naini Tal), Bareilly, Pilibhit, Saharanpur, Gorakhpur, and Fateh- garh; but any of the other districts mentioned in my 8th paragraph are capable of yielding a practically unlimited supply, and bhang is occasionally procured from them. In Saharan- pur a separate contract is given for a wholesale dept. It only fetches a few hundred rupees and is almost invariably taken by the contractor for retail vend in the district. Elsewhere the local contractor does some business in wholesale export, or the contractors of other districts send their agents to purchase direct from the owners or occupiers of land who collect and store the plant. This export, or, more correctly speaking, transport, within the provinces is effected under passes issued by the Collector of the district in the form printed as Appendix XL, in the North-Western Provinces Excise Manual, which is framed for opium, but also used for hemp- drugs. The rules will be found in chapter X of the Excise Manual. 21. The three main localities from which ganja is imported areNORTH-WESTERN PROVINCES AND OUDH MEMORANDUM. 29 In Garhwal a substance is produced and used which might be classed with either ganja or charas. After the charas has been extracted from the female flower the powdered or broken flowers are mixed with hemp seed and smoked in a chillum. This seems akin to the "garda" of the Punjab. The ganja coming from the Central Provinces is known here as "pathar," "pattiyara or pattiyala," possibly on account of its leafy character. It has more waste in the shape of stalk and leaf and apparently less of the resinous secretion than the Bengal drug. But, as I have already said, it can be prepared to simulate the latter. Mds.

Our contractors who bring it from Khandwa pay no duty there, but have to meet warehouse and registration fees, which, I believe, come to about Rs. 2 per maund. It varies a good deal in quality according to the season and probably also according to the skill of the cultivators who grow and prepare it. Many of the specimens I see contain more or less seed, showing that the male plants have not been completely extirpated. Pathar, whether from the Central Provinces or Gwalior, &c., is most largely used in the central districts of these provinces and in those western districts where ganja is consumed at all. It is gradually making its way in the eastern districts, where it is supplanting baluchar. I do not think the import of Khandwa pathar is increasing just at present. The figures marginally noted show the imports for the last 10 years. From what some of our contractors have told me, I think Gwalior ganja has been gain- ing ground, as it has latterly been rather cheaper owing perhaps to bad crops in the Central Provinces and the heavier railway freight to many of our districts. The construction of the Indian Midland Railway has apparently improved the market for Gwalior ganja. 24. The Gwalior ganja is of the same character and appearance as the Central Provinces "pathar." It is known here by the same name and is used in the same places and by the same people, in fact it stands on exactly the same footing as the latter. Like the latter, too, it seems to vary considerably in quality. On an average I should say, it is neither better nor worse than that which comes from Nimar. It is the product of careful cultivation and pre- paration. Colonel Pitcher, Director of Land Records and Agriculture for the Gwalior State, has kindly supplied a memorandum on this point prepared by his Assistant, Pandit Gopal Ram, which will be found as an appendix to this report. The State duty of Rs. 5 per maund must be calculated on the drug stripped from stalk and waste and ready for use. My en- quiries here show that our contractors pay duty to the farmer at the rate of Re. 1-8-0 to Rs. 2 per 100 bundles. The fact seems to be that the farmer, paying a lump sum to the State, collects the duty in the way he finds most convenient to all concerned, and is not very particular provided he gets a fair offer. The incidence of the duty on weight of the drug is very much a matter of conjecture or estimate. I have no doubt myself that the actual incidence on the cleaned stuff comes in the end to less than Rs. 5 per maund. Some of the contractors I have spoken to have been under the belief they paid less dues in Gwalior than Khandwa. The Gwalior ganja as a rule is despatched by rail from Antri on the Indian Midland Railway, The State is bound by treaty not to permit the export of intoxicating drugs, &c., by any route or direction formerly barred by the Inland Customs line. This restriction had been disre- garded, but the attention of the Darbar was called to it in 1887, and they took measures to enforce it. The principal measure, curiously enough, was to double the duty on ganja exported to British territory. The convenience now afforded by the Indian Midland Railway, added to the above restriction, now confines the conveyance to the railway, but I have no doubt that if the inducement existed, it would be quite easy to smuggle in the drug at many points of our land frontier. Dattia. Chattarpur. Sampthar. Kadaura (Baoni). 25. Of the same class as the Gwalior ganja is that imported from some of the Bundel- khand Native States. I give in the margin the name of those States from which ganja has been from time to time procured by our contractors. To these may be added Dholpur, which is under the Bhartpur agency. The plant is cultivated in Dattia, Sampthar, and Chattarpur to some extent, and the drug is not, so far as I could observe, distinguishable from Gwalior ganja. In all these States there is some duty on export, but it seems to be variable and unequal. In one place I am told it is two annas per rupee of the price of the drug which would be about Re. 1 to Rs. 2 per maund. In another place it is said to be Re. 1-9-0 on each purchase irrespective of quality. But these rates require confirmation. I am not sure that all the ganja brought from these States is of local growth; some of it, I suspect, comes from Gwalior or Khandwa originally. I learnt in Hamirpur that the Chirkari State supplies itself from Khandwa. I believe also that ganja as well as bhang finds its way from our districts into adjoining native territory. The import of ganja from these States is inconsiderable and irregular. It is only brought into a few of our Bundelkhand districts, but it is a source of supply which is capable of extension. 8
30 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. 26. Before quitting this part of the subject I ought to mention that these and other Native States not only adjoin, but are interlaced and intermixed with British territory. There are numerous native villages scattered over our districts, and in some cases considerable tracts entirely surrounded by British possessions. The capital and a great part of the Chirkari State is situated in the middle of the Hamirpur district. All these places serve as centres from which excisable commodities are freely smuggled into our territory. The country being wild and mountainous prevention is impossible. I have elsewhere mentioned that a small quantity of very inferior illicit ganja is intro- duced from Nepal. I am told that there recently used to be authorized import of an inferior sort of ganja known as Mahadewa from Nepal; but I have been unable to verify this or get a specimen. A little pathar ganja still comes from Indore. The supply from this quarter used to be large. Ganja of a potent sort is said to be also procurable in Rewah, but whether of local growth or imported from the Central Provinces is not clear. A small amount of ganja is exported from Bahraich into Nepal. It is imported ganja. 27. I have mentioned all the sources, so far as I can discover, from which ganja is at present imported. But within recent years ganja in considerable quantities has been brought from places further south. Holkar's territory, Berar, Mewar, Nasik, Nasirabad, and Khandesh, and perhaps other places in the Bombay Presidency are sources from which supplies have been drawn within the last ten years. Latterly, however, the proximity of Khandwa and Gwalior and the cheapness of the drug there seem to have given them a monopoly of the business in pathar. But in considering the possible sources of supply, the places I have mentioned should not be overlooked. 28. The great bulk of the charas consumed in these provinces is brought from Yarkand and Bokhara. It comes through the Punjab, and the Commission can procure there better information than I can give them concerning its manufacture, quality, transport, &c. Some information on the subject will be found in my predecessor's letter of 29th August 1881 to the address of the Board of Revenue, of which a copy, I understand, has been supplied by the Board to the Commission. I am told by the traders that the charas from Central Asia is now less pure than it used to be. It is also much cheaper at present than it was some years ago, but the price is liable to considerable fluctuations. 29. The other sources of supply are Nepal and our own hill districts, Almora and Garhwal, A small amount also finds its way from Thibet into both British and Native Garhwal. A little is also sent from Garhwal into Thibet. The drug imported from Nepal is known as Shahjahani or Saljahani charas and is introduced through the Bahraich district from Nepalganj. A small amount is also introduced from Nepal into British Garhwal or Kumaun. I append a report by the Deputy Commissioner of Bahraich describing the method of produc- tion and manufacture. His information was, I believe, derived from the Nepalese frontier officials and the local traders. This charas is of a very superior quality and commands a high price; Rs. 10, 1st quality, and Rs. 3, 2nd quality, per seer. At present it seems all to go to Lucknow, where it is retailed at Rs. 35 or Rs. 40 per seer. Some used to be sent to Cawnpore. The importation appears to have fallen off, as the Yarkand charas has become cheaper, but its better quality still secures a market for the Shahjahani drug. Dr. Watt states on the authority of Dr. Gimlette that Nepal charas sells in Katmandu for Rs. 2 and in the Tarai at Rs. 3 per tola (Rs. 160 and Rs. 240 per seer). If these figures are correct, they show how enormously the drug must be adulterated before it reaches our market. I remember once hearing that very superior Nepal charas has been sold in Lucknow at its own weight in gold. This source of supply could, no doubt, be again largely extended if the demand arose. I believe the amount at present imported is from 25 to 50 maunds a year. 30. The hemp plant, I should add, is also cultivated in the Native Hill State of Tehri Garhwal, but none of the products which include charas are said to be imported into our dis- tricts at present. 31. The whole of the charas produced in the Himalayan hill districts is locally consumed and is also supplemented by the import of Yarkand drug which is cheaper and which is said also to be gaining favour because it is more potent. I find it difficult to believe this latter statement because I have little doubt the Himalayan charas is much the purer. It has been described to me as milder (colder) and less injurious than the other. This can best be settled by a chemical analysis, and for this purpose I am procuring specimens, which will be submitted. Possibly the more pungent taste of the Yarkand charas may be due to substances with which it is adulterated. But that it contains more of the true hemp resin I find it difficult to believe. My predecessor appears to have been misled in describing the Kumaun charas as inferior. The price paid by the contractor is from Rs. 5 to 8 per seer, about twice or thrice the price of the imported charas. It is difficult to estimate the amount of the annual produce, as much of it is consumed by the people who make it, or is illicitly sold. So far as the contractors'
NORTH-WESTERN PROVINCES AND OUDH MEMORANDUM. 31 statements go only five or six maunds annually pass into their possession. This must be a small part of the produce, which, moreover, could be largely extended if there were a sufficient demand. 32. I have made many enquiries to ascertain if true charas is in these parts of India ever extracted from the plant grown in the plains. I have now got definite information of two localities in which this occurs. It was stated incidentally that some charas is made by the ganja cultivators in Gwalior. Colonel Pitcher has kindly verified this through his Assistant, Pandit Gopal Ram, who reports that "a certain amount of charas is obtained in this (Gwalior) State by scraping off the resin which adheres to the hands in cutting the ganja plant. In tahsil Antri the cultivators do not care much about the charas. In tahsil Kalaras, district Narwar, I hear charas is obtained in small quantities by the same process as in Kumaun and Garhwal." The second locality is in the Kumaun Tarai and Bhabar, where the practice was possibly introduced by the hill men who come down to cultivate there. The method is the same as that employed in the hills. The flowers of the wild plant are rubbed in the hands and the resin which adheres is scraped off. No record can be kept of the amount so prepared, but it does not as yet seem to be considerable. I have obtained specimens' of this charas from both Gwalior and Kumaun, and will submit them to the Commission. It is a fact of first-rate importance to know that charas can be and is manufactured in the plains and from the wild plant. This at once enlarges immensely the possible sources of supply. It has been stated that charas is collected in Sind and Central India by the tradition- al process of men, naked or leather clad, running through the hemp fields. The story seems to require verification. It seems strange that no charas is produced in all the handling which the Bengal ganja undergoes in the process of preparation. ADMINISRATION 33. The excise on hemp-drugs is administered under Act XXII of 1881 and rules there- under. The administration is carried on by the ordinary district staff. The central control- ling authority is the Board of Revenue. The Commissioner of Excise has the power of a Revenue Commission under the Act. His statutory powers are limited to those defined in sections 54 and 14 of the Act. He has little initiative or final authority, and acts chiefly as an intermediary between Collectors and the Board. There is one uniform system of administer- ing the drug revenue for the whole provinces. The right of sale over a fixed area is farmed to a contractor, who is at liberty to procure his drugs wherever he likes and to sell them at any price he chooses. No distinction is drawn between the different sorts of hemp drugs; all are included in the same license and are stored by the farmer on his own premises. There is no import duty here of any sort. The contracts are usually for an entire district32 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. necessary to arrange otherwise. Regard is paid to the solvency and respectability of the rival bidders. The Collector has always the prices of previous years to guide him, and is obliged to explain any substantial fluctuations. These depend on the competition, on the character of the season, and on the variations in the cost price of drugs. The number of capitalists engag- ed in the trade is not very large, and nothing is commoner among them than combinations to keep down the price. I have noticed this point in my annual report for 1891-92. Latterly, I think, the value of these contracts has become better known and the contractors' profits shorn to more reasonable dimensions. Measures have also been taken to defeat combinations, and with good results. Still it is a defect in the system that it leaves the whole of the reve- nue collected here to be determined by the competition of the auctions. The advantages of the system are that a large revenue is very easily and cheaply collected and that smuggling and other evasive or illegal acts are minimized. The contractor has no reason to commit them himself, and it is his interest to detect any one attempting them. This is no small advantage from an administrative point of view. Retail prices are under the existing system kept at the highest possible point. 35. The rules which govern the import of all forms of hemp-drugs will be found in the Excise Manual, Chapter X. All import, export, and transport is under passes signed or countersigned by the local authority. In the case of ganja and bhang the only importers are our own contractors. Charas is also brought in by Panjabi traders, who sell to those of our contractors who do not care to procure their supplies direct from the Panjab. These traders frequent a few centres to which they convey their stock. Their sales are all reported and duly registered on their passes. They take out no licenses as they sell only to contractors, for whose convenience they are permitted to trade in the manner described. The legality of this arrangement is questionable and will be considered when the rules come under revision. Some of these traders themselves hold district contracts, and in such cases of course their proceedings are open to no objection. Sometimes contractors, instead of importing from foreign provinces, obtain their supplies from contractors of other districts. This happens in the case of drugs in small demand or in the event of sudden emergencies. Such consignments are conveyed under pass. In these ways a good deal of transport of drugs takes place from one part of the provinces to another. The amount of smuggling from outside the provinces is, I believe, quite inconsiderable: the reason is given above. A little ganja and charas finds its way over the frontier, no doubt at many points in the possession of travellers, fakirs, and the like, who chiefly bring * Ganja and charas, 5 tolas. Bhang, it for their own consumption. Within the legal limits of quarter seer. possession* this cannot be prevented. I have no reason to believe that any illicit traffic or sale occurs which is worth taking into consideration. Occa- sionally drugs brought from one district are illicitly sold in another to the injury of the con- tractors. This can rarely be done without the connivance of some licensee of the district from which the drugs are brought, and is usually the result of hostility between rival con- tractors. The authority of the police and revenue staff is always exerted to suppress such practices. But there is undoubtedly a considerable consumption of bhang and a certain, though small, consumption of ganja locally produced which pays no tax direct or indirect. How this happens will be sufficiently understood from what I have said in the earlier part of this memo- randum. It would be difficult to check and impossible to wholly suppress this consumption. Illicit import would easily and rapidly increase if stringent measures were adopted to repress trade in, and consumption of, drugs. CONSUMPTION 36. In the tabular statement which accompanies this memorandum, the columns showing the quantities sold retail, are necessarily blank. Any record of the sort would have to be kept by the retail vendors, and, if it could be maintained at all, would be utterly un- trustworthy. It follows, therefore, that statistics showing the amount of drugs actually consumed or retailed are nowhere available. This is inevitable. Where a commodity is issued as required, like opium or country spirits, from a Government dept on payment of a fixed duty, such a record can be kept, and it may fairly be assumed that the whole amount issued is consumed within the year. But this is not the case with hemp-drugs. The amount con- sumed can only be inferred from the amount of imports and exports. This might not be correct for any one year, because the imports of one year are often consumed or exported in the next. But over a series of years the net imports of charas and ganja will afford a very fair indication of the consumption if allowance is made for waste and deterioration. In the case of hemp-drugs this is not inconsiderable, for they deteriorate rather rapidly. Even an accurate return of the import and transport of bhang would fail to show the true consump- tion, as there is a large amount locally grown of which no trustworthy return could be secured. The statistics of import and export are, I regret to say, very defective. In the absence of any fixed duty and with a revenue determined solely by the license-fees no provincial record of the traffic has been kept up. An enquiry commenced a year and a half ago showed that
NORTH-WESTERN PROVINCES AND OUDH MEMORANDUM. 33 even complete figures for 1890-91 were not always available. Hence the fragmentary charac- ter of the details in columns 11 to 18 of the tabular statement required by the Commission. Even such figures as are available in the years anterior to 1891-92 must be received with caution, as I am not confident that allowance has been made for transfers from district to district, and there is much risk that the same drugs may have been counted twice and the provincial total thus exaggerated. More accurate figures and for a longer period could be furnished to show the total imports of ganja from Lower Bengal and the Central Provinces. But in the absence of correct information from the other sources of supply these are useless as an indication of the Provincial consumption. The official returns of bhang are peculiarly apt to be misleading. They give the imports and exports district by district, and, as bhang is moved a good deal about the provinces, there has been considerable opportunity for error as long as no regular register and return of the consignments was maintained. Moreover, these statistics can take no account of the bhang consumed in districts where it is grown. In the case of untaxed bhang this must always happen, and I doubt if any system of registration will secure very accurate returns of even the bhang which passes through the licensed dealers' hands. The trade returns are of little value. An attempt to utilize them has shown that much of the imports and transports follow routes by which they escape registration. 37. The special enquiries which were made in 1881-82 give the amount of imported ganja to be approximately 4,451 maunds. The later and I think more trustworthy returns show a total import of 4,935 maunds in 1890-91 and 4,187 maunds in 1891-92. The imports of charas are similarly shown to be 1,135 maunds in 1881-82, 1,091 maunds in 1886-87, and 1,286 maunds in 1887-88. For 1890-91 the returns show maunds 1,133-30-9 and for 1891-92 maunds 1,217-4-12. Collating these figures, it might be reasonable to assume that the imports of ganja are between 4,000 maunds and 4,500 maunds yearly and the imports of charas between 1,100 maunds and 1,200 maunds. These figures, however, exaggerate the actual consumption because, besides other reasons, there is good deal of waste. Both ganja and charas deteriorate by keeping and considerable quantities become useless from this cause. On the other hand there is a certain consumption of locally-grown drugs of both kinds which cannot be ascertained. 38. The average consumption per head of ganja is estimated by Babu Hem Chander Kerr at 1 seers per annum. This appears to me a very high estimate. In the case of baluchar retailed at 6 annas per tola it would mean for an ordinary consumer an outlay of Rs. 45 per annum, a quite impossible figure. Ganja is generally smoked in company, and a pice worth will go round two, three, or more people. It is also smoked several times a day. I should put two pice a day or Rs. 11-6-6 per annum as the maximum possible per head. This would represent less than half a seer yearly in the case of baluchar. On the other hand, baluchar sells for half the price in the villages, though consumption there is relatively much smaller. Pathar sells for one anna or half an anna a tola, but more of it is used in each pipe. Two pice worth a day of this would represent about 41/2 seers yearly at the latter, and 21/4 seers at the former price. Taking one thing with another and averaging all sorts of ganja, I should think a seer a head would be about the amount annually consumed by those who habitually indulge in the drug. This would give 180,000 consumers for the 4,500 maunds imported, if it were all used. My observations go to show that those who use ganja and charas indulge in them habi- tually and regularly. The craving is perhaps not so dominant and the abandonment not so difficult as in the case of opium. But where they can be procured, they are, as a rule, regular- ly taken. This is not the case with bhang. 39. Concerning the average consumption of charas, I have received most conflicting statements. But every one agrees that a much smaller quantity of it makes a dose. I should say half a seer per head yearly would be a fair estimate. That would represent 92,000 con- sumers of the 1,150 maunds imported. These figures are on the basis of habitual consumption and would be susceptible of increase if there were many occasional consumers. But on the other hand considerable abatement must be made for drugs imported, but not consumed. I submit these calculations with much diffidence, for I am aware that anything like absolute accuracy is unattainable. They are framed on the highest scale, and would show that even so computed only a very small propor- tion of the population is addicted to the use of these drugs. 40. The use of bhang is much more general. It is also much more harmless or even positively beneficial. I am informed that in Bengal Dr. Prain has pronounced bhang to be more harmful than ganja. I have not been favoured with a copy of his report, and so I can- not examine his reasons, which may be peculiar to Bengal. But I can affirm with much con- fidence, as the result of repeated enquiries, both official and private, and of personal observations extending over many years, that bhang as used in these provinces is not only the least harmful 9

[APP. of all forms of hemp-drugs, but is largely used and much esteemed as a tonic by very many people who do not take it for its intoxicant effects and who only use it at certain seasons and in certain states of health. I cannot frame any estimate of the number of bhang con- sumers. Only a portion of those who use it, take it regularly all the year round and it is used in very variable quantities. There is no safe estimate of the amount consumed, and it is used for other purposes than human consumption. 41. The returns showing the annual revenue from hemp-drugs are complete and some deductions may be drawn from them. To facilitate this I append an abstract statement show- ing the district and provincial revenues since 1873-74.

[APP. It is necessary, however, to remember that abnormal figures which appear in this table are in some instances due to the method of keeping accounts on which the Accountant General's Department insists. For instance, some part of the unusual increase in 1886-87 is caused by the inclusion in the returns for that year of the security advances made on account of the following year. In the previous year the sums shown were those paid on account of the year of report. In the last year 1892-93 these security advances for 1893-94 are not shown, as they had not been made when the statement was compiled. In some cases, again, security advances have been refunded where sanction to a contract has been refused by higher authority, but the sums have still to appear in the accounts. I must also observe that these figures do not take account of the very large revenue collected in Bengal on ganja consumed in these provinces, and which from 1884 to 1892 was credited to us by inter-provincial adjustment though it was not reported to this Department and does appear in our Excise returns. In 1889-90 this was as much as Rs. 1,37,741, but has since fallen off. 42. Still these figures on the whole give a fairly correct view of the progress of the provincial revenue from this source. In the twenty years since 1873 the receipts have grown from Rs. 4,07,822 to Rs. 7,06,788, or over 73 per cent. In Oudh the increase has been over 193 per cent., in the N.-W. Provinces it has been 50 per cent. For this increase I assign three causes:NORTH-WESTERN PROVINCES AND OUDH MEMORANDUM. 39 The history of the Banda district is also a case in point. During the years 1864-71 the distillery system was in force. The drug revenue then averaged Rs. 7,661, rising in1870-71 to Rs. 8,090. The distillery system was condemned as unsuitable to the district and was abandoned in favour of the outstill or farming system. The drug receipts fell in 1872-73 to Rs. 4,256, and in 1873-74 to Rs. 3,650, and notwithstanding the general provincial im- provement are now below Rs. 6,000. The fall of drug revenue in 1872-73 is due altogether to the change of system which made country liquor again accessible to the people. In the North-Western Provinces the most marked increase of drug revenue has been in the eastern districts belonging to the Gorakhpur and Benares Divisions. These are the districts in which the habit of spirit-drinking was most prevalent and where the enhance- ment of price and curtailment of supply under the Central Distillery System has been most severely felt. Before the introduction of that system these districts furnished 40 to 50 per cent of the total revenue of the North-Western Provinces from country spirits. I find that in 1862-63, when the system was introduced, the percentage was 48. The percentage of the total provincial revenue from hemp-drugs furnished by the same area in that year was only 18. In 1890-91 the former percentage had fallen to 31 and the latter had risen to almost 32. In 1862-63 the drug contract for the Benares district was Rs. 7,000: in 1890-91 it had risen to Rs. 44,000. Oudh was essentially a spirit-drinking province. The consumption was everywhere large. The administrative changes have affected it more than the North-Western Pro- vinces. In Oudh the S. H. D. before 1877 was 12 annas per gallon, in the North-West- ern Provinces it was Re. 1-8. In that year a uniform duty of Re. 1 was imposed in both provinces. The figures already quoted show that while the drug revenue of the North-West- ern Provinces has increased by Rs. 50 per cent., that of Oudh has increased by Rs. 193 per cent. Meanwhile the liquor revenue from Oudh has increased by Rs. 100 per cent. only. A reference to the tabular statement will show the very low incidence of drug revenue in the Bundelkhand districts where the outstill system is in force. I am unwilling to prolong this memorandum by accumulating figures and arguments on this point. But it is one which seems to me to deserve the most serious consideration. Facts, figures, and opinions point irresistibly to the conclusion that the measures which have been taken to restrict the supply of country spirits and increase the revenue from it have tended pari passu to stimulate the use of drugs. If it be admitted that so long as human nature remains unchanged, some form of stimulants will be used, it follows that any measures to restrict drugs will be only half successful unless they are accompanied by measures which will render less harmful stimulants more accessible. It is necessary to remember that even behind hemp-drugs there are deeper depths. Dhatura, strychnine, aconite, and other poisons may occupy the field from which spirits and hemp-drugs are excluded. 45. There is one other matter which I would like to mention before quitting the subject of the provincial revenue from hemp-drugs. In his otherwise admirable monograph on the hemp plant, the author of the Dictionary of Economic Products has committed himself to many severe strictures on the fiscal and administrative policy of this Government. I have no hesitation in asserting that he has been largely misled by fallacious conclusions from errone- ous statistics. It would be out of place here to enter into a detailed examination of his errors, some of which lie on the surface. But as his work is, no doubt, in the hands of the Commis- sion, I would venture to record a warning against accepting either its statistics or its conclu- sions as far as these provinces are concerned without a careful scrutiny or without a reference to those who could explain supposed anomalies or defects. Prices. 46. I have at various places mentioned the current prices of the different drugs. I here give them in collective form. The wholesale prices are those at which the contractors procure them. The retail prices are those at which the public buy them. There is a third set of prices at which contractors supply their sub-licensees, but these are merely for the adjustment of accounts. The retail prices are only approximate. They vary very widely from place to place. Besides district variations, prices are often twice or thrice as high in large towns as in rural parts. They are also lowest at the borders of districts where they come into com- petition with the drugs of other vendors. Prices also vary with the amount purchased. When sold by weight in any quantity, the drug is cheaper; when sold in made up packets or doses, the price is higher. I doubt if retail prices vary much from year to year. The vendors in every year charge as much as they can get, and as the difference between cost prices and retail prices is enormous, there is always a large margin of profit, A rise of cost price comes out of the profits of the contractor or the Government revenue, or both. But wholesale prices vary very much from year to year, according to the supply and demand and to the duty which may be imposed on the produce or in transit. The prices here given are those now current. It is hardly necessary to add that all prices vary with the quality of the articles sold. These drugs deteriorate rapidly and are often sold off at nominal prices, a circumstance which will frequently account for the extraordinary discrepancies in reported rates.

I would again call attention to the great disproportion between the wholesale and retail prices of ganja and charas. In bhang the scale of profit is not so high because it has to compete with the wild or illicit plant. The high prices are due to the monopoly of sale under which the contractor exacts the very highest price he can without creating illicit competition. He does not wish to extend his sales because he finds a greater profit in smaller sales and higher rates. CONTEMPLATED CHANGES OF SYSTEM. 48. Finally I come to the proposed modifications of the present system. A suggestion has more than once been made to impose an import duty on hemp-drugs, but it did not meet the approval of the higher authorities. It is also open to the objection that the Excise Act does not authorize the imposition of an import duty. I made a representation on this subject some time ago. Since then the Excise Act has been amended by Act X of 1893. That Act, as I understand it, deals only with imports from beyond British India. The statutory power seems still wanting to control imports and impose import duty on drugs brought from other parts of British India. If this view is correct, a further amendment of the Excise Act is required to legalize the arrangements now suggested. 49. I do not think it possible to impose either an import duty or a fixed local duty on bhang. The opportunities for evasion are altogether too extensive. For bhang we must trust, as at present, to our contract license fees. But it might be well to prohibit the import of bhang altogether. The province can supply its own wants, and there would be always some risk that ganja or charas might be surreptitiously introduced under cover of a pass for bhang. But for ganja and charas I think it both possible and desirable to impose a fixed import duty. For this purpose it will be necessary to make rules to control both local cultivation and manu- facture and import. Briefly I would suggest rules to provide for the following heads:42 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. MEMO. ON NIPAL (SHAHJAHANI) CHARAS. The ganja shrub from which charas is made grows wild in certain villages of the hills one hundred miles and more inwards. "Kala Des," "Gora Des," "Pentan" are mentioned as some of the places. Charas is a sticky exudation from the seed pods and minute leaves surrounding the seeds. It is obtained by gently rubbing these pods and leaves between the hands. The "resin," for want of a more correct term, adheres to and is peeled off the hands, and during this process the originally colourless matter becomes black. The small leaves must not be confounded with the ordinary leaves of the plant. I give an illustration.* Charas is made in April and May when the seeds are ripe and the big leaves fall off. I am sending you two samples. The larger one, made into sticks a foot long and 1/2 inch thick, is adulterated with the leaves and cuticle, and probably other foreign matter. The smaller sample is in the form of a cake and is the pure stuff. The first sells in Nipalganj at Rs. 3, the second at Rs. 10 a seer. The quantity exported annually from Nipaljang is said to be 50 maunds of 40 seers a maund, but this information must be received cum grano. It is true, however, that some years ago a very much larger quantity was imported into British territory. I do not know the cause of the decline. There is very little consumption among the Nipalese I hear. At Nipalganj an imperial export duty of Rs. 11-4 per maund and a choongee-tax of the market value of 1/4 seer per maund are levied. The shrub is not culti- vated. The resin is not produced by the shrub in the Tarai or plains. It is secreted only in the villages among the mountains, but at what altitude I can't say. It is called charas in the interior, but Saljehani (probably a corruption of Shahjehani) is the name given to the coarser kind in Nipalganj. The fibre is not utilized. The shrub is an annual, dying in the rains and springing up in October. Ganja is not cultivated or prepared in the Bahraich district. Ganesh Murao, a contractor in Lucknow, imports charas from Nipalganj. There is a slight exudation in the bud in the shrub found here. By bud I mean seed cuticle, flower, and adjacent leaves, but is too slight to collect. Natives say the ganja shrub has no flower, and they distinguish ganja from bhang by this difference, and the circumstance that the bhang shrub is sterile, bearing a flower, but yielding no seed. The bhang tree is consequently not repro- ductive, but comes from the ganja seed. Charas is known to be conveyed to Lucknow and Cawnpur. It is taken probably to other places. It is carried in skin vessels and inside bundles of bhang. The profit made by contractors should be considerable, as they sell it in British territory at double the price paid for it in Nipal. A cloth, a strong canvas, used for bags, is made from a cultivated plant in the hills called Bhangra, which natives confuse with bhang. It grows in the form of hemp, "san," in the plains, and the raw material is extracted in the same way, that is, by immersion in the water till it rots. MEMO.NORTH-WESTERN PROVINCES AND OUDH MEMORANDUM. 43 Ganja, after being cut, is stored in a convenient place, and is daily crushed by the culti- vators with their feet before it is made in small bundles. This is done when the ganja is green. A certain amount of charas is obtained in this (Gwalior) State by scraping off the resin which adheres to the hands in cutting the ganja plant. In tahsl Antri cultivators do not care much about the charas. In tahsl Kolaras, district Narwar, I hear charas is obtained in small quantities by the same process as in Kumaun and Garhwal. (Sd.)

The system of excise administration in respect of intoxicating (hemp) drugs in the Punjab has been receiving a great deal of attention during the last five or six years; and it so happens that, as the outcome of much inquiry and discussion, we are now on the eve of the introduction of a new set of rules which will alter and improve that system in many respects. It will, I think, be convenient if I explain how matters stand at present. The correspon- dence on the subject is voluminous, and there is certainly no dearth of information. General facts with regard to hemp drugs in the Punjab. * Note.PUNJAB MEMORANDUM. 47 and, on a reference to the Government Advocate, it was pointed out by him that there was no power under the Excise Act to impose such a duty. The orders of the local Government on the proposals are contained in Punjab Government letter No. 8, dated 11th January 1892 (No. 16 of the Proceedings). The Lieutenant-Governor "was of opinion that a tax of Rs. 20 per maund might be imposed upon charas with effect from 1st April 1893. No doubt the retail price of charas will be somewhat raised; but this in itself is an advantage, as the use of the drug is certainly pernicious." Accepting the opinion of the Government Advocate as to the manner in which the tax should be imposed, the letter describes the system to be adopted48 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. These figures do not agree very closely with those given in our Excise Returns, which I will examine presently; but I give them because they are in a way from an independent source. It will be seen that there is actually no import of ganja shown, while the quantity of "other kinds" is exceedingly small. With regard to the large quantity of bhang shown as imported from Kashmir in 1890-91 this may be treated as if it were produced in our own districts (e.g.,Gurdaspur). The wild plant grows in the sub-montane parts of Jummoo and comes into our districts just as it does from other areas of supply within the Punjab. It will thus be evident that except charas the import of these drugs from beyond our northern and western fron- tiers is of very limited quantity. As regards charas, what is shown as coming from Kashmir is from the same source (Yarkand) as that shown from Ladakh. Most of the Yarkand charas takes the ordinary route through Leh to Sultanpur (Kulu); but a certain quantity of it passes westward through Kashmir territory. This was pointed out by Captain Ramsay, Joint-Commissioner, Leh, in his letter which will be found at page 7 of the printed Proceedings quoted at the commence- ment of paragraph 3. In paragraph 5 Captain Ramsay says "charas will grow, though not well, in Kashmir; but as a matter of fact it is not grown in Kashmir, and in Ladakh it of course could not be grown. The charas shown under the two heads Kashmir and Ladakh con- sists of Yarkand charas imported (1) vi Ladakh and Kashmir to the Panjab, (2) vi Ladakh direct to the Punjab through Kulu." These trade returns are obviously defective in some respects. They show no drug as coming across the western frontier (from Sewestan) or the north-western (from Bajaur), except that from Kabul, while there is undoubtedly a certain amount of import trade into the Derajat and Hazara. This probably appears under other heads in the trade returns. But the figures given are useful as showing that there is a very large import of charas from Yarkand, and that the import of this drug from other quarters and of other drugs from all sources is unimportant in comparison with this. 8. The following figures of imports and consumption of charas are taken from the Excise Returns:PUNJAB MEMORANDUM. 49 Details of the consumption of bhang. 9.

The Sikh population of the province being 1,389,934, these four districts contribute 781,439 towards this total. It seems likely that the prohibition amongst the Sikhs of tobacco-smoking has a good deal to do with their preference for the drug in a liquid state. This question of the distribution of consumption according to locality, religion, caste, &c., is one that will, no doubt, receive a great deal of attention from the Commission, and it seems unnecessary in this memorandum to do more than indicate the general features. An- nexed to the memorandum will be found two maps showing the consumption of charas and of bhang separately by districts in the year 1890-91, and these will serve to illustrate the above remarks. It will be seen that, roughly speaking, as regards the use of charas the province divides itself into two parts52. REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. Punjab must obtain a pass (Appendix III) from the Deputy Commissioner of the frontier station where they enter the Punjab, and take it for countersignature to the Deputy Commissioner or Collector of every district in the Punjab or the North- Western Provinces, which they may subsequently enter with the charas. The article, its quantity (both gross weight of the package and net weight of the charas being given), and destination are stated in the pass, and the package is seal- ed up with the official seal of the Deputy Commissioner. It may be opened at any head-quarters station or tahsil while on the way to its destination, and a portion of its contents may be sold to the farmer of excise for drugs, the fact being recorded on the pass, and the package resealed. The owners must be warned that if the package is found open and any charas is sold from it, except as above stated, they will be proceeded against under the Excise Laws, and the package will be liable to confiscation." Where a consignment is conveyed by rail, the provision requiring it to be taken to the Deputy Commissioner, &c., of every district through which it passes is dispensed with.

No special measures of prevention have been found necessary. (k) The modifications of the present system, which are under consideration, have been described in the early part of this memorandum.

The main portion of the Ladakh trade finds its way into India through Kulu. The Assistant Commissioner in his report makes some interesting observations, pointing out that while the Kulu posts register as Ladakh trade much that is really trade with Thibet and other places, they also fail to in- clude a large portion of genuine Ladakh trade which enters British territory vi Kashmir. He remarks:CENTRAL PROVINCES MEMORANDUM. 57 CENTRAL PROVINCES MEMORANDUM. The period for which the Hemp Drugs Commission require statistics begins with the year 1873-74, when the Act in force in the Central Provinces regulating excise matters was No. X of 1871. The only section of that Act which authorized the levy of a duty or tax on hemp drugs (then included with opium in the term "intoxicating drugs") was section 24, which provided as follows: "Whenever a license for the retail sale of * * * * intoxicating drugs is granted under this Act the Collector may demand, in consideration of the privilege granted, such tax or duty, or a tax or duty adjusted on such principles, as may from time to time be fixed by the chief revenue authority." 1871-72. 2. In the first year for which the Act was in force, i.e., 1871-72, the revenue from "drugs" was Rs. 70,713, that from opium being Rs. 1,71,316. "Drugs" included "madak," in spite of the fact that madak was known to be merely a preparation of cpium. The monopoly of vend of "drugs," either for each district as a whole or for small areas, was everywhere put up to auc- tion and knocked down to the highest bidder. The monopoly of the vend of opium was sold separately; but in most cases the same person took both it and the monopoly in respect of " drugs." From paras. 24 and 25 of the Excise Report for the year it appears that the desir- ability of separating receipts from ganja and those from madak was making itself felt, and also that proposals for restricting cultivation of the hemp plant were under consideration. 1872-73. 3. In this year madak was not classed with ganja, and the revenue from the latter fell from Rs. 59,625 in 1871-72 to Rs. 55,824, or by nearly 7 per cent. The bids for the right to retail madak in 1871- 72 had fetched Rs. 11,087, and that and the opium monopoly were sold together for the first time in 1872-73. In almost every district a few hemp plants were to be found in the gardens of cultivators, and it was only in Raipur and Bilaspur that a license fee was imposed on cultivation. The right of retail vend of ganja was, as before, auctioned by circles, the circle sometimes being as large as a tahsil, sometimes much smaller. The expediency of re- stricting cultivation was still being considered. The number of shops in the year was 987. 1873-74. 4. For some years past our retail contractors had complained that the extensive cultiva- tion of ganja for home consumption by private individuals seriously interfered with their profits and prevented them from paying to Government as high a revenue as they otherwise might. In December 1873 Deputy Commissioners were accordingly asked to report on the following points:58 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. 1874-75. Ch. VIII of Excise Manual, 1875. 5. In April 1875 rules for controlling cultivation were sanctioned, the main object of which was to put a stop to the practice of growing for home- consumption. Cultivation, except under license from the Deputy Commissioner, was prohibited, and no license was to be obtainable for plots of less than an acre in extent. More- over, each cultivator was bound to obtain from the Tahsildar a license to cover the possession of his gathered crop until its sale to a licensed vendor or exporter, and stocks were made liable to inspection by Excise officers of all grades at all times. The rules also provided for the levy of a fee per acre on cultivation, but no fees were fixed till the year 1875-76: in Raipur and Bilaspur the old rate of fees, viz., Rs. 0-8-0 an acre, remained in force. For facility of refer- ence Chapter VIII of the Excise Manual, 1875, has been reprinted and annexed as Appendix B* to this Memorandum. The revenue of the year was derived, as before, by auctioning the monopoly of vend, and competition at the sales resulted in bids rising from Rs. 50,707-12-0 to Rs. 56,263-2-1, or by nearly 11 per cent. Shops numbered 1,261, or 1 to every 6,478 of the population served;in Nagpur City and in the interior of Hoshangabad there were 18 and 141 respectively, allowances which were declared in the Resolution on the Excise Report for the year to be "inordinate." The acreage fees on cultivation in Raipur and Bilaspur amounted to Rs. 819-8-0, and these have been shown as fixed duty in Appendix A. 1875-76. 6. The rules of 1875 were in force throughout the year 1875-76, but they did not influence the revenue of the year which was settled at the auction held before their issue. That revenue was Rs. 54,245-10-11, excluding acreage fees on cultivation, which amounted to Rs. 807-8-5. The acreage fee was fixed tentatively for one year at Re. 1 per acre; the amounts real- ized are shown as fixed duty in Appendix A. Receipts under this head were very small in Raipur and Bilaspur compared with those for the preceding year, and probably indicate that scattered cultivation had considerably diminished. The statistics of area cultivated and num- ber of licenses granted are not quite complete, but it may be taken as certain that, only in the Khandwa and Katol tahsils was ganja produced in any large quantities; the districts of the Nerbudda Valley with Sangor and Damoh drew their supplies from Khandwa, while the hill districts of Betul, Chhindwara, Seoni, and Mandla and the entire Nagpur and Chhattisgarh Divisions imported from Katol. The terms on which licensed vendors of different districts obtained their supplies appeared to have varied greatly, but a uniform retail price of 1 pice weight for 1 pice prevailed all over the provinces. Retail shops numbered 1,254, or 7 less than in 1874-75; 12 had been closed in Hoshangabad, where the allowance had been condemned by the Chief Commissioner as excessive, but Nagpur City was still left with 18. Looking to the total population, the incidence of revenue from ganja per head fell at the rate of 1 pie, or less than would suffice at that time to buy an ordinary smoker one day's supply of the drug. 1876-77. 7. The old system of raising the revenue was adhered to in 1876-77, viz., (1) selling the farms and allowing the contractors to make their own arrangements for obtaining the drug, (2) levying an acreage fee on cultivation. These sources yielded respectively Rs. 58,995-12-5 and Rs. 1,630-4-0. The improvement in bids for the right, of retail vend appears to have been due to rising con- fidence in the arrangements for the control of cultivation, but the Administration recognized that, no matter what precautions were taken, much ganja must be reaching consumers which had paid little or no duty, and that bidding would not be keen until every crop raised was taken under direct control. In this year a special penal fee on unlicensed cultivation was introduced: the Re. 1 rate was made applicable only to cases in which a license was obtained before sowing, and Rs. 10 was to be levied on every acre or fraction of an acre not so protected. The penal rate was realized in '33 cases in Jubbulpure and in a few cases in some other districts. The effect of the restrictions which had by this time been placed on the right to cultivate freely was most marked in Raipur and Bilaspur, if the increase in the amounts bid for the right of retail vend in those districts was due to it, as appears to be the case; but the decline in the number of licenses applied for and the amount of fees levied was so sudden and rapid as to justify a suspicion that unlicensed cultivation of small plots must have been going on undetected. The table below, bringing together statistics for three years, will make the above remarks clearer:CENTRAL PROVINCES MEMORANDUM. 59 The number of permanent retail shops open during the year was 1,226, but of these 123 (in Bilaspur 102, Nursinghpur 4, and Bhandara 17) were open on bazar days only. In Hoshang- abad the number had been again reduced till each shop had an average population of over 5,000 persons to serve. The incidence of revenue per head of total population rose from 1 to nearly 1 pie. Of consumption no satisfactory estimate can be made: in the Excise Report of the year 1,000 maunds was stated to be the probable amount. 1877-78. 8. Similar arrangements to those of 1876-77 were in force in the Khalsa. The most important measure taken during the year was the extension of the Khalsa rules regarding the cultivation and possession of ganja to the zamindaris both feudatory and non-feudatory, of the Chhattisgarh Division. Very little, however, was done towards assimilating practice in those zamindaris to that in the Khalsa, the order on the subject having issued only a short time before the cultivating seasonbegan. The revenue of the year was raised in the same way as that of 1876-77. Bids for the right of retail vend improved from Rs. 58,995-12-5 to Rs. 62,894-14-10, all districts except Narsinghpur and Sambulpur contributing to this result. The enal rate of acreage fee (Rs. 10 per acre) was in several districts vigorously exacted, and collections under this head amounted to about. Rs. 4,000: including fees at the rate of Re. 1 per acre, the tax on cultiva- tion yielded Rs. 6,368-2-9. Statistics of area cultivated are not available for 2 (Wardha and Balaghat) out of the 15 districts in which fees were levied, but it is safe to say that in none except Nagpur and Nimar was the quantity produced at all considerable. It would appear from the statements for the 2 years that (Appendix A) 82 more retail shops were worked in 1877-78 than in 1876-77; but in the latter year there were 102 bazar shops in Bilaspur, which are not included in the total given in the statement, although they have been taken into account in the remarks in paragraph 7 of this Memorandum, while the number of such shops in 1877-78 is not ascertainable. The total revenue of the year fell at the rate of rather more than 1 pie per head of popu- lation. Statistics of the amounts sold by retail are not available, and no trustworthy estimate of consumption can be made. From figures in statement No. VI appended to the Excise Report for the year it appears that 3,419 maunds of ganja locally raised were exported to different parts of the Central Provinces, while imports from other British territory and foreign territory amounted to 532 maunds, so that in all 3,951 maunds were imported. Adding for the undermentioned non-importing districts the amounts which were probably consumed as well as raised in them respectively, viz.:60 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. These provisions seemed to be workable enough, especially as in only 2 districts was there anything like systematic cultivation of the hemp plant. Unexpected difficulties, however arose in the disposal of the produce by cultivators to wholesale dealers and licensed vendors. The Commissioner of Excise was present both in Nagpur and Nimar on the occasions when sellers and buyers met for the disposal of the produce. At Nagpur the wholesale dealers held aloof, being uncertain of the effects which the enhanced duty demanded on the drug might have on consumption, while the retail vendors were not prepared to purchase direct or other- wise than in previous years from the wholesale dealers. In Nimar also sellers and buyers failed to come to an understanding. Accordingly it was found necessary, in order to guard the cul- tivators against loss and to secure to Government the control of the entire crop to purchase on behalf of Government 1,856 maunds of ganja in Nagpur and some 5,000 maunds in Nimar at a total cost of nearly Rs. 50,000. These quantities together represented nearly the entire crop of the year in the Central Provinces, so that practically Government obtained a monopoly of the drug. The small cultivation of ganja in districts other than Nagpur and Nimar was specially dealt with. The Wardha crop was taken over by the Deputy Commissioner and forwarded to the Nagpur Store, to be there dealt with like the produce of the Katol Tahsil. In Betul, Chhindwara, Narsinghpur, and Raipur the whole produce was put up to auction and sold to licensed vendors, the upset price fixed being Rs. 36 per maund: the cultivator's share of the proceeds was fixed at one-seventh. 10. The revenue was Rs. 83,144-0-3, of which Rs. 1,727 was collected on licenses to cultivate, a source of income which had now to be finally abandoned in accordance with the opinion of the Judicial Commissioner on the draft rules as first drawn. Bids for the right of retail vend increased by Rs. 18,522-1-5, Mandla and Chhindwara being the only districts which did not contribute to this improvement. The auctions had been held much earlier than usual in order to give licensed vendors generally a fair opportunity of buying their supplies direct from producers: hitherto the principal ganja crops had been for the most part bought up by a few persons for purposes of wholesale vend. Another pro- bable cause of the improvement was the selling of the monopolies as far as possible in small circles, instead of in lump or by tahsils or large circles, as had previously been the practice in several districts. The incidence of revenue rose to very nearly 2 pies per head of population. The number of retail shops which worked during the year is not ascertainable, but was probably much the same everywhere as in 1877-78. 11. With a view to administrative efficiency as well as economy the district formerly known as "Upper-Godavery" was abolished in this year, a small portion being transferred to the Madras Presidency and the remiander being constituted a sub-division of the Chanda district and styled "Sironcha." For the sake of preserving uniformity throughout Appendix A, the statistics relating to the Upper-Godavery district have all along been included in those of Chanda. 1879-80. 12. The arrangements for raising the revenue in 1879-80 were peculiar, owing to the position in which Government found itself as holder of almost the whole provincial stock of ganja. In five districts the circles of vend were not sold at all, but farms were given to men of capital and position, who engaged to find retail vendors and to keep them supplied with ganja taken as it came in the uncleaned state from the Government stores, paying only duty at certain fixed rates on removal from the Stores: those rates were as under:CENTRAL PROVINCES MEMORANDUM. 61 were left in the hands of the men who had bought them for the preceding quarter at the old monthly rates of license fees and on the condition that they purchased only at a Government store or from distributing agents appointed by Deputy Commissioners. Wholesale vendors were employed as distributing agents on a commission at rates varying from 9 pies to 1 anna per rupee on the fixed selling price of Rs. 2-14-0 per seer: this price included both the cost to Government and the fixed duty. 13. The ganja issued for consumption in the year was for the most part raised in the season July to November 1878, and in respect of that season's crop no difficulty in realizing duty under the arrangements just described was experienced. But at the close of the preced- ing year there were stocks of old ganja, the produce of the autumn of 1877, and on these a duty of Rs. 30 a maund was made leviable under the Chief Commissioner's orders: where these stocks in the hands of any one person exceeded 1 maund, a special rate in excess of Rs. 30 a maund was exacted; but in several districts payment of duty was evaded, licensed ven- dors having been allowed, in spite of orders to the contrary, to purchase, after the clese of 1878, quantities largely in excess of what was necessary to carry them on to the end of March 1879. 14. " Bhang" (foreign) was taxed this year for the first time, but statistics of receipts under this head are not available till 1882-83. The rate first fixed was Rs. 8 per maund, and any licensed retail vendor was permitted to import what he required on prepayment of duty at that rate. At the same time a rate of Rs. 10 was imposed on charas. The rate on bhang was raised in July to Rs. 8 per maund less than that charged for ganja, i.e., to over Rs. 100 per maund, taking the ordinary ganja rate to be Rs. 2-14-0 per seer. The cost price in Raj- putana and other sources of supply was Rs. 10 to Rs. 12 per maund. From records in this office it appears that in the preceding half of the year 1879 about 7 maunds were imported into Nimar, Hoshangabad, and Jubbulpore, and that in those districts and also in Chanda, Seoni, Saugor, and Raipur there were old stocks amounting in all to 22 maunds 24 seers. The only districts in which there was any licitly imported charas was Jubbulpore, and the amount there was 37 seers only. On "local bhang," or refuse ganja, a duty of 3 annas per seer was, imposed, the article being issued to licensed vendors at this rate from the Government stores. The chief use of this was as medicine for cattle to get them into good condition. 15. In this year Ganja License Forms VII and X, prescribed by Notification No. 4627, dated the 5th November 1878, were cancelled, and licenses published with Notification No. 996 dated the 12th March 1880, substituted therefor. This step was taken at the instance of the Commissioner of Excise with the object of protecting our revenue against smuggling by rail from foreign territory or from British territory beyond the Central Provinces. Ganja was cultivated in particular in the Indore territory south of the Nerbudda, 7 villages in which the plant was raised forming a group round Sanawad on the railway line between Khandwa and Indore and constituting what was almost an island of foreign territory within the Nimar district. The amount of ganja raised annually was about 1,500 maunds, and this could be bought on the spot at from Rs. 2-4 to Rs. 2-8 a maund, no pass or permit being required. The badness of the roads and the insecurity of life and property throughout Central India rendered it practically impossible for traders in this ganja to reach a market otherwise than by rail and therefore by passing through British territory. It was obviously essential to keep a watch on consignments so sent, and rules 7 and 8 of the Notification of November 1878 were meant to be read, with Forms VII and X, as requiring imports from outside the Central Provinces to be taken to a Government store-house under one license (Form VII) and then exported under another (Form X). But Form VII merely required that imported ganja should be delivered at the Central Store, "to be there disposed. of according to the orders in force for the produce of cultivators resident beyond the Central Provinces." It was therefore found necessary to pro- vide specifically for the examination of consignments booked to railway stations within the Central Provinces, and the revised Form VII contained the necessary conditions. At the same time Form X, which in its original shape was practically useless, was altered so as to render all ganja, whether purchased within the Central Provinces or in course of transit through them for sale in other parts, liable to examination by any Provincial Excise officer at any time. 16. The gross receipts under ganja for the year were Rs. 89,937, but the arrangements for securing payment of the newly imposed direct duty cost Rs. 6,636, so that net receipts were only slightly in excess of those for 1878-79. The quantity of ganja sold retail was nearly 600 maunds, representing some 800 maunds of uncleaned hemp, but it would not be safe to conclude that this represents anything like the quantity actually consumed during the year. In Nimar only 6 maunds 24 seers of ganja were sold under the sanctioned arrangements, but there can be no doubt that this amount was quite insufficient for the wants of the district, and smuggling from the Sanawad pargana of Indore is known to have gone on to a great extent. Retail prices everywhere ruled much higher than they had ever done before, the cost price to licensed vendors being nowhere less than Rs. 2-12-0 per seer, or about 2 pice for one pice weight. The total number of retail shops rose to 1,223, but the figures for districts differ greatly in many instances from those of 1877-78 and 16
62 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. 1878-79, and no satisfactory explanation of the differences can be given. In Bilaspur and Sambulpur bazar shops appear to have been included in the enumeration: elsewhere there were generally fewer shops, to judge from statement IV appended to the Excise Report for 1880-81. It is difficult to believe that only 252 acres were under ganja in the year in Nimar, but enquiry on the point has failed to bring any other statistics to light. The produce of the Katol Tahsil amounted to 250 maunds, but the area cultivated cannot now be ascertained. 1880-81. 17. The Government of India, in sanctioning disbursement of the money which had been spent in 1878-79 in purchasing the crop of that year and also old stocks left in the hands of certain dealers whose licences expired on the 31st March 1879, and were not renewed, remarked that they were not disposed to favour the permanent creation of a Government monopoly of ganja. Accordingly, for 1880-81 the monopoly of wholesale vend for the whole province was granted to a single contractor (Kaluram Marwari of Kamptee), who agreed to pay a direct duty of Rs. 2 per seer on all ganja sold by him to retail vendors and to issue the drug to retail vendors at Rs. 3 per seer. Under the agreement, the text of which will be found in Appendix D,* hemp drugs other than ganja were to be supplied to retail vendors at certain fixed rates per seer: those rates and the corresponding rates of duty payable to Government were:CENTRAL PROVINCES MEMORANDUM. 63 Accordingly, the representatives of Kaluram, the wholesale contractor for 1880-81, were given a contract for supplying the whole province on condition of their taking over this stock for Rs. 18,000, besides purchasing the crop raised in 1880 in Nimar only: that crop was esti- mated at 2,500 maunds. The agreement entered into with the firm will be found in Appendix F.* It will be observed that the wholesale supply of ganja, &c., was left entirely in their hands, and that they were required to maintain an agent at the head-quarters of each district and tahsil (except Sironcha, where the existing arrangements were allowed to stand). With a view to avoiding unnecessary loss to the firm from cost of carriage of refuse stuff, it was arranged that the cleaning of the ganja should ordinarily be done at Khandwa or at Nagpur, but where the journey was likely to produce considerable injury to the drug, Deputy Commis- sioners were instructed to arrange for its being cleaned at its destination. The stocks main- tained by the agents were to be examined by the tahsildar, or in his absence by the naib- tahsildar, every fortnight. The examining officer was required to deduct the amount of the closing balance for the fortnight from the total of the opening balance and of any subsequent additions to stock: on the difference so ascertained and verified, which represented the amount sold by the agent, duty had to be paid. Each agent of the firm was provided with a license for the wholesale vend of ganja, foreign bhang, charas, and majum, and also for the retail vend of the last mentioned article. In most districts retail vendors held their shops as in 1880-81, i.e., on monthly licenses at rates which varied in different localities and without restriction as to the number of licenses granted in any one place. In Seoni and Saugor shops were auctioned on the old system, and there was a large increase in receipts from license fees in those districts. 21. The revenue of the year was made up as under64 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. No licenses to cultivate were granted in these 3 years, inasmuch as the rules of November 1878 did not provide for this formality: any one might cultivate, provided that he gave written notice of his intention to do so. Excise Act, 1881. 23. During the early part of the year 1881-82 the Bill which eventually became the Ex- cise Act, 1881, was under consideration. The Act of 1871, so far as it related to hemp-drugs, had been found wanting in three important particulars, viz.:CENTRAL PROVINCES MEMORANDUM. 65 at fixed rates issued without limit as to the number of shops at any one place had not generally answered, the reason being that sufficient data for deciding what fee might fairly be fixed in each case were not available. The sale of foreign bhang was no longer permitted to retail vendors of ganja: wholesale ganja contractors and their agents were constituted sole vendors of the drug. The bhang imported had to be stored in the same way as ganja, and a direct duty of Rs. 2 was made leviable on each seer sold. No fee was payable for a license for retail vend of foreign bhang. Charas and foreign majum had never been imported, so no provision for their sale was required. The case of local majum appears to have been overlooked when the rules were framed; but the plan started in 1880-81 of licensing separate shops for its sale continued to be followed in practice. (See para. 17.) 25. Advantage was taken of the opportunity afforded by the breaking up of the monopoly of wholesale vend to obtain some revenue from wholesale license fees. The arrangement with the firm of Jaitram Mahadeo had been to levy duty at Rs. 2 per seer on the cleaned ganja issued, and to allow them to sell that ganja at Rs. 3 per seer to retail vendors. The terms of that arrangement were more favourable than the circumstances of most districts justified, and each wholesale vendor had henceforward to pay a certain amount per seer in addition to the direct duty of Rs. 2, the rate varying in different districts and being general- ly determined by tender. 26. The Sironcha sub-division of the Chanda district had from the first, as already remarked, been excluded from the system of supply prevailing in the rest of the province. Retail vendors had always supplied themselves with ganja from the Hyderabad and Madras country. The rules of February 1882, however, only permitted import by wholesale vendors, and licenses could only be granted by the Deputy Commissioner and with the sanction of the Commissioner of Excise. To meet this special case, a rule was added empowering the Assist- ant Commissioner of the Sironcha sub-division to grant import licenses to any authorized vendor of ganja. 27. The gross revenue of the year, excluding credits to Government on sales of ganja to certain feudatory States in the Raipur district, was Rs. 1,11,095-6-1, made up as follows:66 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. In all districts except Hoshangabad and Chhindwara the wholesale ganja contract was given to a single contractor: in the two districts named, the contracts were given by tahsils, as in the preceding year. 29. The amount of ganja sold by wholesale vendors to retail dealers increased by 157 maunds, and there was a consequent rise in the direct duty levied. Wholesale vendors, how- ever, paid on the whole less for their monopolies, the reason being that in some districts a lower rate per seer had been accepted, with the object of leaving the contractor a good mar- gin of profit and so encouraging him to supply good ganja and maintain efficient agents at tahsils. The lowering of the price to retail vendors from Rs. 3 to Rs. 2 in Sambulpur was sup- plemented by special efforts to repress smuggling from feudatory States, and by enforcement of the agreement with the wholesale vendor that only good, clean ganja should be supplied: the result of these combined forces was that sales went up from nearly 5. maunds in 1882-83 to 21 maunds, the total revenue being at the same time more than doubled. Other districts in which sales improved considerably were Nagpur, Jubbulpur, Seoni, Raipur and Bilaspur. In Nimar sales fell off largely, but the retail license fee demand more than doubled, circum- stances which are explained in the Excise Report for the year by the breaking up of gangs of labourers employed in the preceding year on the G. I. P. and Rajputana railways and by reck- less bidding at the sales by two rival contractors who had quarrelled. No material change took place in the number of shops anywhere except in Sambulpur, where the larger sales of taxed ganja demanded an increase in the number of licensed places of vend. The incidence of gross revenue per head of population was 22/3 pies. 30. The amount of ganja taken by feudatories and by zamindars who controlled their own revenue from hemp-drugs was 80 maunds against 56 in 1882-83. The improvement was due to the success in Raipur and Bilaspur of the arrangements made in 1880. The Sambulpur feudatory Chiefs, on the other hand, did not co-operate cordially in the suppression of ganja cultivation, and they took from the district wholesale vendor less than half of the amount taken in the preceding year. 1884-85. 31. In 1884-85 a new form of wholesale license was introduced. The form prescribed in 1882 was not found to be sufficiently complete, and it was supplemented in practice by a separate agreement. The Gazette Notification publishing the substituted form is reproduced as Appendix J* to this Memorandum. 32. The number of licenses for cultivation, the area cultivated, and the quantity of ganja deposited in the Central Stores were all unprecedentedly high in this year. The figures for 3 years are subjoined:CENTRAL PROVINCES MEMORANDUM. 67 for the whole year instead of being given out from month to month as in 1883-84, when the average number of licenses issued monthly was only 45. 34. In the Excise Report, written by Mr. L. K. Laurie, the year's statistics are remarked upon as follows:68 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. total revenue demand on account of ganja rose by more than Rs. 30,000, the incidence per head of population going up from 3 to 4 pies. The districts in which the demand was greatest were:CENTRAL PROVINCES MEMORANDUM. 69 42. In June 1887 the Government of India sanctioned a substantial increase in the rates of duty on round and choor ganja in Bengal, and the Chief Commissioner thereupon requested the Commissioner of Excise to report whether the duty should be raised in this province also. In reply the Commissioner reported that the effect of raising the duty of Rs. 2 a seer would be to lower the bids for retail veud monopolies, and that it would be specially inappropriate to raise the duty just when consumption had declined owing to the losses which had followed on the failure of harvests, in whole or in pars, for two successive years. Accordingly, the rate was left unchanged. 43. Two other suggestions for improving the ganja revenue were submitted, though not recommended for adoption, by the Commissioner of Excise, Mr. L. K. Laurie, in this year, viz., (1) to abolish wholesale vendors, Government purchasing and retailing the drug through its own agents, and (2) to economize establishment by closing the store at Nagpur and pro- hibiting cultivation in the Nagpur district altogether. The Chief Commissioner agreed with Mr. Laurie in thinking that, on the whole, Government agency was unsuited for purchasing and selling the drug to retail vendors, and that it was best to postpone suppression of culti- vation in Nagpur, until the effect of imposing a storage fee upon the extent of that in Nimar had been well ascertained. 44. Supervision of harvesting, drying, and storing of the ganja crop was introduced this year, and has been exercised annually ever since. A case had been brought to light of a cul- tivator having a considerable quantity of the drug in his possession at his village-home, and there was thus reason to believe that many of the complaints of smuggling were due to secret disposal of ganja illicitly kept back by cultivators. The following establishment was accord- ingly entertained for the Khandwa tahsil:70 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. excessive and reduced to 30 days on the recommendation of the Deputy Commissioner, Nimar. It was found that cultivators took advantage of the long period allowed to keep their crop in the villages as long as possible, thus entailing increased expense on Government for watch and ward and securing great opportunities for pilfering and illicit transfers. 48. 1889-90 was the last year in which cultivation was permitted in the Katol tahsil. The cultivators there had never been able since the introduction of the system of levying a direct duty in its existing shape to obtain a fair price for their produce, the reason apparent- ly being that it was of inferior quality. Moreover, it was by this time certain that the amount raised in Khandwa was far in excess of provincial requirements, and would suffice to meet them even in a year of bad harvest. Accordingly, in May 1890 notices were issued to the Katol cultivators that they would not be allowed to raise ganja any more. The formal notification restricting cultivation to the Khandwa tahsil of the Nimar district was not issued till July 1891, the opportunity being taken of revising generally the rules of 1882. 49. The revised rules are printed as Appendix O* to this Memorandum: they are for the most part identical with those of 1882 as amended up to date, but include in addition one (3) relating to the practice of conducting harvest operations under Government supervision and two (6 and 7) calculated to ensure payment of registration and storage fees: a rule (10) was also added prescribing payment of storage fees and at the same time exempting cultivators and wholesale vendors of the Central Provinces from liability to such fees for a period of one month from dates of storage and purchase respectively. A minor change was made in respect of the authority to grant through transport passes, which were to be obtainable only from the Commissioner of Excise, instead of from the Deputy Commissioner of either Nagpur or Nimar. 50. In 1891 rules for the management of the Khandwa ganja store-house were drawn up, and were finally approved of by the Chief Commissioner in December of that year. Those rules are printed as Appendix P* to this Memorandum: they are full and explicit, and do not call for any comment here. 51. Lastly, the conduct of retail shops has been sensibly altered in two ways. In August 1890 the Chief Commissioner directed the insertion in all retail licenses to be thereafter granted for the sale of any intoxicating drug of a condition that consumption on the premises should not be permitted: this condition has been enforced throughout the Central Provinces since the 1st April 1891. The other change consisted in recasting the form of license for retail sale of ganja, and including in it a prohibition of sales on credit and by way of barter and a re- quirement that purchases shall be made direct from the wholesale vendor for each shop sepa- rately, shall be entered in the pass-book of the shop for which the ganja is intended, and shall then be taken to that shop and to no other: the amended form is printed as Appendix Q* to this Memorandum. 52. The total revenue from hemp-drugs has risen during the past 5 years from 2 to over 21/2 lakhs, and is now considerably more than double what it was in 1882-83, the year in which the present arrangements for supply of ganja to retail vendors were initiated. The following table shows how the position of districts has altered during this quinquen- nium in respect of consumption of taxed ganja and receipts on wholesale and retail licenses for the sale of that drug: the revenue from bhang and majum being comparatively insignificant is not taken into account:CENTRAL PROVINCES MEMORANDUM. 71 The most striking feature of the statistics is the rise of the districts of the Chhattisgarh Division to the position which, in view of their population, they would naturally be expected to occupy. These districts account for more than half the increase in consumption of taxed ganja since 1887-88, and the chief causes at work have been (1) improvement in administra- tion in feudatory States and (2) extension of the Bengal-Nagpur Railway, and in Raipur the construction of water-works. Relations with feudatory Chiefs and with zamindars who enjoy the right of making their own arrangements for retail sale in their estates will be discussed when the subject of smuggling is taken up. Nimar and Betul continue to be the districts where the consumption of taxed ganja is most noticeably short: in the former district cultivators can no longer secrete much of their crop, but ganja is still largely grown in Indore, while in Betul much Berar ganja is undoubtedly consumed. Wardha and Nagpur and in a less degree Chhindwara also are, like Betul, exposed to smuggling from Berar, where the ave- rage retail price of ganja is only 6 pies per tola. Seoni and Balaghat have always stood high as contributors to our revenue from ganja: in the latter district licit sales have increased enor- mously. In Bhandara, where also sales have greatly improved, it is said that the habit of ganja-smoking is no longer considered disreputable, and that the chief cultivating class have taken to it. The Chanda district sales do not include those of the Sironcha tahsil, where retail vendors, owing to the remoteness of the tract, were allowed until the current year to supply themselves under import licenses from foreign territory: the consumption in that tahsil is probably about 6 maunds per annum. The steady rise in the provincial consumption of taxed ganja attracted the special attention of the Chief Commissioner in 1892, and in the Resolu- tion on the Excise Report for 1891-92 the Commissioner of Excise was directed to make en- quiry as to whether that drug was ousting either country liquor or opium. This enquiry is still in progress, and until the Chief Commissioner has had the results before him and re- corded the conclusions to which they lead, further comment on the statistics just dealt with will serve no useful purpose. 53. Sales of foreign bhang do not fluctuate much from year to year: the average of the past quinquennium is about 12 maunds per annum. This drug is not sold at all in the dis- tricts of Chanda, Seoni, and Mandla, and very little in Bhandara and Wardha. Most is sold where Marwaris are most numerous, i.e., in Nagpur, Jubbulpur, Narsinghpur, Hoshangabad, Raipur, and Bilaspur. 54. Statistics of area cultivated and quantities stored and exported for each of the past five years are as under for the Nimar district:72 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. Present retail prices. 55. The average retail price in most districts for small quantities of ganja is 2 annas per tola, but where the full amount of which possession is allow- ed by law, viz., 5 tolas, is bought, a rate of 0-1-6 per tola is generally taken. In the districts open 'o smuggling from Native States on the north and west, rates on the border are as low as 0-1-3 and sometimes even 1 anna per tola. In rural areas in the Sambulpur district and also in the Drug and Simga Tahsils of Raipur the rate is 1 anua per tola: in the Sheorinarain Tahsil of the Bilaspur district it is 0-1-3 per tola.

A system of modified local option in respect to the licensing of country liquor shops was introduced into the Central Provinces under the orders of the Government of India in 1889: such shops are more than six times as numerous as those for the sale of ganja, and no orders for consulting the residents in places where ganja shops are to be licensed have yet been issued. The Administration has all along shaped its policy in regard to the licensing of ganja shops on the assumption that the drug is extremely deleterious, and it is a standing order that no more should be licensed than are necessary to meet the demands of consumers who, if a licit supply were not obtainable, would probably supply themselves illicitly. Moreover, the location of drug shops is a matter of comparatively little importance now that consumption on the premises has been prohibited. Upset prices are not fixed, but no shop is licensed unless a reasonable bid is forthcoming. Wild hemp. 57. It is believed that the hemp plant does not grow wild in any part of these provinces. Summary of present system of control. 58. An endeavour has been made in the foregoing paragraphs to trace the development of the present excise system in respect to hemp-drugs in the Central Provinces, and to notice the most striking varia- tions from year to year in the area under the ganja-produc- ing plant, the outturn therefrom and the revenue raised by means of taxing consumption of the two preparations in use, viz., ganja and bhang. It remains to give in a brief yet com- prehensive form an account of the system as now worked: the necessary information has been embodied in Appendix R, which follows closely Chapter V of the Excise Manual drawn up in 1885 by Mr R. C. Anderson, when Commissioner of Excise, and includes also the instruc- tions given In a few important subsidiary circulars. Untaxed cousumption. Section 20. 59. This Memorandum will now be brought to a conclusion with a brief statement of the difficulties in the way of realizing a tax on all ganja con- sumed within the province and of the chief mesures for com- bating them which have been taken from time to time. Small quantities of ganja not exceeding 5 tolas may bo legally possessed by any one, and inasmuch as the Excise Act, 1881, only authorizes regulation of import and transport when effected by persons intending to supply licenced veodars, there is nothing to prevent a smoker carrying about, no matter whenc obtannes, as much as will suffice an habitual moderate consumer for 15 or 20 days. A glance at the map which accompanied the Excise Report for 1889-90 will show that the Central Provinces are cut off by Native Males and Chiefships from the rest of British terri- tory except in the extreme south and south-east, in the extreme west and in the north- west, where the herder runs for comparatively short distances with those of the Lalitpur, Khandesh, and Godaveri districts respectively Starting from the extreme south and working along the Western border, we had first the Nizam's Dominions, separated from the Sironcha and Atul tahasils of the Chanda district by a water boundary consisting of the Godaveri and its tributaries, the Pranhita, and Wardha rivers. Until August of the current year the Siron- cha tahasils, owing to its inaccessibility and the cheapness of ganja in Hyderabad territory, was, as already remarked (para. 26), exempted from the direct tax on comumption introduced in 1880-81: is has now been experimentally brought under the system prevailing elsewhere in the Khalsa proper, information having been received that in consequence of certain fiscal re- forms the price of ganja has risen in Hyderabad. The Resident has been addressed with the object of ascertaining the nature of the alleged reforms, and his reply is still awaited. 60. Proceeding northwards we find the Berars marching with the Mul and Warora tahsils of Chanda, all three tahsils of Wardha, the Katol tahsil of Nagpur, the Saosar tahsil of Chhindwara, both tahsils of Betul, and lastly the Burhanpurtahsil of Nimar. The revenue from ganja, is raised by (1) levying, a license fee of Rs. 10 per acre or part of an acre on cultivation and (2) auctioning the right of retail vend; but the retail price is nowhere higher than 1 anna per tola, while in the Wun district it is only 3 pies, and elsewhere generally 6 pies. In 1888 the Chief Commissioner authorized the Commissioner of Excise to consult the Commissioner of Berar with regard to the cultivation of ganja in that province and the possibility of checking its carriage across the Central Provinces borders: the Commissioner was accordingly asked to consider the possibility of raising the retail rate to that prevailing in these provinces and imposing an import duty. The objection at first raised against taking action in the direction thus indicated was that it would lead to smuggling into Berar from the Bombay Presidency, where ganja was selling at the rate of Rs. 2 per seer, but subsequent- ly, in pursuance of orders received from the Resident at Hyderabad, a set of draft rules for regulating the import, export, and transport of ganja and for prohibiting its cultivation was prepared. These rules are still under consideration.
CENTRAL PROVINCES MEMORANDUM. 73 In 1880-81 two special peons on Rs. 5 per mensem were entertained, one by Govern- ment and the other by Kaluram, the wholesale contractor, for the purpose of detecting smuggling on the western frontier of the Betul district, but they proved a failure, and their services were dispensed with after a few months. The fact is that salaried detectives are of little or no use, as they are liable to be bribed by the very men whom they are paid to watch. 61. The Khandesh Collectorate of the Bombay Presidency succeeds the Berars as conter- minous territory, and it is the Burhanpur tahsil of the Nimar district which is on the Central Provinces side of the boundary. Reference has already been made to the extremely low price of ganja throughout the Bombay Presidency: cultivation of the ganja-producing hemp plant is not restricted in any way, though manufacture and sale of the intoxicating drug is required to be covered by licenses, and the revenue, which is under 11/2 lakhs, is derived from annual farms of retail monopolies and from permit fees at the rate of Rs. 5 per 10 maunds on imports exports, and transport. Cultivation is largely practised in Khandesh and also in Ahmadnagar and to a less extent in the Broach, Sholapur, Surat, Satara, and Poona Collectorates: ganja is one of the few articles of export of these comparatively poor districts, and it would appear that Government is accordingly unwilling to lay any very heavy tax on trade in the drug. 62. Next to Khandesh comes Indore, in the Sanawad Pargana of which ganja is largely grown. That pargana divides the Kanapur-Beria tract from the rest of the Nimar district, and there is thus a considerable area into which introduction of the untaxed drug is practically inevitable. In 1879 the Commissioner of Excise, with the approval of the Chief Commission- er, suggested to the Agent to the Governor-General in Central India that exports from Holkar territory should be taxed and only permitted under formal pass; a duty of Rs. 7 per maund was accordingly fixed by the Darbar. Other States under the Central India Agency which bound the Central Provinces on the north-west are Bhopal and Gwalior; in both of these local transit duties are levied, but they are not sufficiently high to check transport into the neighbouring British districts, viz.,Hoshangabad, Narsinghpur, and Sangor. In Gwalior the export duty is, so far as can be ascertained at present, Rs. 2-12-0 per maund: the Maharaja is said to be bound by special agreement to prevent export into British territory. In the Resolution on the Excise Report for 1889-90, the Chief Commissioner declared his intention of referring for the consideration of the proper authorities the questioun of limit- ing or taxing production in the Central India States: the result of the action taken has not been communicated to this office. 63. Damoh is probably the district the revenue of which suffers most from consump- tion of untaxed ganja. There are villages belonging to the Panna State scattered up and down the Hatta tahsil, and in one village belonging to that State and only a few miles from the head-quarters of the district ganja is freely grown; in all these villages the drug is sold at 10 aanas or 12 annas per seer. Complaints have been made to the Darbar from time to time, but without much effect. The injury to our revenue from country liquor as well as to that from ganja which is caused by the existence of these facilities for obtaining a cheap supply of the latter, will be better appreciated when it is remembered that, whereas the Provincial percentages of revenue from the two intoxicants to the total excise demand were respectively 60.6 and 8 9 in 1892 93, they were in Damoh 33 and 28.8. There is compara- tively little competition for country liquor monopolies, but a fair sum is realized from licens- ing ganja shops, as illicit ganja can be sold under the licenses without much risk of detec- tion. Ganja is grown in Rewa, and some is doubtless introduced into the Murwara tahsil of Jubbulpur and into the Dindori tahsil of Mandla. 64. That portion of the border of the Central Provinces which runs from the north-east corner of Mandla to the extreme east of Sambulpur, and then south-west to the point from which we started, divides them from a series of Tributary States and Mahals in Chutia Nagpur and Orissa and from the Jeypore State in the Madras Presidency. For many years past the absence of restriction on the cultivation and sale of ganja in these territories has very materially affected the sales of taxed ganja in Bilaspur and Sambulpur and in the feuda- tory States on the east. Most trouble was caused by smuggling from Gangpur and Boad, and in 1883 the Commissioner, Chutia Nagpur, and the Superintendent of the Tributary Mahals in Orissa were addressed on the subject. The first mentioned officer thereupon issued parwanas to the Chiefs of Gangpur, Udaipur, Surguja, and Lakhanpur, informing them that they must not allow ganja to be grown by any one without their permission, that they must keep lists of those who grew ganja, and see that no one either grew more than they needed for home use, or sold to others. The Superintendent of the Tributary Mahals, Orissa, however, was unable to do more than request the zemindar of Boad to warn his people that it was an offence punishable by our courts to carry ganja into the Central Provinces. InChutia Nagpur the action taken by the Commissioner was for some time effective, but by 1888 the special attention of the Chief Commissioner had been drawn to the matter, and the Commissioner of Excise was directed to consult the Commissioner, Chhattisgarh Division, 19
74 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. as to whether a gcod case could be made out for asking the Government of Bengal to pro- hibit cultivation in those States, as had been done in the similar Chiefships attached to the Central Provinces. The Commissioner of Excise, having complied with the order, reported that it was clearly expedient to have the cultivation of ganja in the said States prohibited, and the Government of Bengal was addressed accordingly by the local Administration. In reply, it was contended that the Garhjat ganja was much less noxious than that raised in the Central Provinces, was prepared and consumed in a different way, and consequently could not really compete with it. Local enquiry made with the object of testing the truth of this contention led to the conclusion that the drug which was smuggled into the Sambulpur district from Boad and from Gangpur was ganja proper; differed little from that grown in Nimar; was, like it, smoked, and so far from being less harmful, actually produced more lasting intoxication. The Bengal Government was informed of this result, and it then suggested the levy of a duty on all Garhjat ganja imported into the Central Provinces. In reporting on the merits of this suggestion, the Commissioner of Excise pointed out that, owing to the wild and unexplored character of the frontier and the portable nature of ganja, smuggling into the Khalsa and feudatory States of the Central Provinces was easy, and could not be checked by the imposition of an import duty, unless the local Adminis- tration entertained a preventive establishment, the cost of which would be prohibitive and altogether disproportionate to the results possible of attainment. The Chief Commissioner, after satisfying himself that the cultivation of ganja had been practically suppressed in the local feudatories, referred to the Government of India the question of suppressing such cultivation in the border States of Madras and Bengal, but was informed in reply that the local Governments did not see their way to adopting the course proposed. The only course now open, so far as the local feudatories are concerned, is to reduce the maximum of 5 tolas which may be legally in possession of any person, and this the Chiefs of Bamra, Rairakhol, and Sonpur have already expressed a desire to do. The Chief Commissioner has recently directed that the question of reducing the said maximum should be taken up for all the feudatory States concerned, and that if a reduction is decided on, it should be uniform for all. 65. The injury caused to the Khalsa revenue by unrestricted cultivation in the feuda- tory States within the Central Provinces and in the zamindaris the proprietors of which enjoy the privilege of administering excise arrangements themselves has already been noticed. Nothing came of the extension to those estates of the rules made in 1875 (see para. 8) and in 1880 special arrangements were made, which will be found set out in Part 2 of Appen- dix R to this Memorandum. Each Chief and zamindar was required to take the ganja required for consumption by his people from the wholesale vendor of a given Khalsa district, and it was stipulated that they should prohibit cultivation and issue the drug to their retail vendors at a rate at least equal to that at which issues were made to retail vendors in the neighbouring Khalsa. In the case of Bastar alone no attempt was made to arrange for supplying ganja from the Khalsa: the hemp plant was widely cultivated there, and Government did not deem it. expedient to interfere. It was because of their proximity to Bastar that the Ranker state and the Khariar and Bindra-Nawagarh zamindaris were to be supplied at rates more favourable than those fixed for the other States and zamindaris in the Jtaipur district respectively. These arrangements were fairly successful in Kaipur and Bilaspur, but in the Sambulpur StatesCENTRAL PROVINCES MEMORANDUM. 75 The following table shows the amount (in maunds) of ganja issued to feudatory States and zamindaris by wholesale vendors of the Khalsa during each of the past ten years:76 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94.

Although ganja is cleaned before issue, the mere fingering of it in the process of sale to retail vendors causes a residue of crumbled fragments to form. This residue, or refuse, as it is commonly called, though it is by no means useless, is small in quantity, and is not allowed to accumulate. It can be easily amalgamated with subsequent issues, if not allowed to collect and grow stale by keeping: when it amounts to a seer or upwards it is treated as consumed ganja, and is destroyed by burning, duty being levied as if it had been sold. At the end of June and December in each year the balance of ganja under double lock is verified by the tahsildar by actual weighment. When ganja is sent by road, it is escorted by one or more police constables, whose pay while on this duty is recovered from the transporter. Each tahsil must be supplied direct from the Khandwa Central Store, and the amount in stock must never be less than will suffice for two months. Transport passes to cover removal of ganja from one tahsil to another are only granted in cases of urgent necessity. The quantity of ganja produced in the Khandwa tahsil is far in excess of what is required for consumption in the Central Provinces, and there has never hitherto been any necessity for granting an import license. Retail vend. 5. The number of shops to be licensed in each district is fixed by the Deputy Commis- sioner subject to the control of the Commissioner of Excise. Ordinarily only as many shops are licensed as are necessary to meet the demands of consumers who, if a licit supply were not obtainable, would probably supply themselves with the drug illicitly. None is established in any place merely for the benefit of one or two occasional ganja smokers. In those districts, however, which are special- ly exposed to smuggling from foreign States shops are licensed more freely. The localities of all shops are definitely fixed, sale at other localities being prohibited. The monopoly of retail vend at each locality is auctioned separately, but in large towns the shops are generally sold in lump: temporary bazar shops are generally attached to the nearest per- manent shop and sold with it. The general rule is that retail shops are to be auctioned, but with the sanction of the Chief Commissioner shops can be licensed on payment of a fixed year- ly or monthly fee. All retail vendors are entitled to obtain from the wholesale vendor as much good, fresh and well cleaned ganja as they require at Rs. 3 a seer, except in Sambulpur and the south-east part of the Raipur District, where they are supplied at Rs. 2 per seer. In order that the consumption of ganja at the retail shops may be watched, and that the retail vendors or their servants may be secure from molestation when taking their supplies to their shops, they are furnished with a pass-book in which the wholesale vendor enters up everypurchase of ganja made from him. (3). Foreign bhang. The consumption of bhang is not general, being chiefly confined to Marwaris. Every wholesale vendor of ganja is given a license for the retail vend of this drug free of charge. Licenses are not granted to any other persons, and no wholesale vendor may import without a written permit from the Deputy Commissioner. A duty of Rs. 2 per seer is payable on all foreign bhang sold, and the rate of sale to the public must not exceed Rs. 3 per seer. Stocks of bhang are kept under control in the same way as ganja. (4). Majum. Majum is a confection prepared from ganja, ghi, and sugar, and the use of it is for the most part confined to the Holi and Moharam festivals. Shops are sold by auction, and ordi- narily the right to make and sell this preparation is restricted to the Holi festival. (5). Registers and Returns. A register is kept in the district office of monthly sales and duty receipts in respect of ganja and bhang. The tahsildar is required to submit the necessary information at the end of the month, and obtains it from a similar tahsil register. This information is eventually embodied in the monthly and annual returns submitted to the Commissioner of Excise. 2.CENTRAL PROVINCES MEMORANDUM. 81 at Rs. 2 per seer.

Introductory Remarks.MADRAS MEMORANDUM. 83 suggestion to fix 40 tolas as the maximum quantity of the drug that might be possessed with- out license was negatived by Government, as the extension of the provisions of the Act, con- templated and sanctioned, referred only to the sale and not to the possession and transportof the drug. 6. On a representation from the Collector of North Arcot of the difficulty experienced in choosing among a number of rival applicants, and of the large profits earned by shopkeepers, which, without any risk being incurred of pushing the sale of intoxicating drugs, might be diverted to the public exchequer, the remedial measure of enhancing the license fees from Rs. 30 and 15 to Rs. 45 and 30 in Madras and the mofussil respectively was proposed by the Board and approved by Government to take effect from 1st April 1890. 7. Experience, however, showed that the demand for these drugs was considerably larger than was suspected and that the competition in certain districts for the privilege of vend was, in spite of the enhanced license fees, very keen, in consequence of which the difficulty of deciding between the claims of rival applicants was seriously felt. The Board thereupon con- sidered that the already increased rate of license fees might be further enhanced or that the auction sale system might be adopted for ascertaining the true value of shops. As the balance of opinion among Collectors was against the continuance of the fixed license fee system as being entirely inadequate and unsuited to the object in view and as sale by auction was advo- cated by most of them, the Board recommended the latter proposal and suggested that a minimum retail selling price of 4 pies per tola of ganja might be prescribed as a check against licensees making undue profits by reduction of prices and stimulation of sales. Both these proposals were sanctioned by Government and effect was given to them from 1st April 1891. 8. The sale of intoxicating drugs prepared from the hemp plant having thus been placed on a satisfactory footing, the next question that engaged the Board's attention was whether, having regard to the reported increase in consumption of ganja, it would not be justifiable to impose restrictions also on the transport and possession of the drug. Closely connected with this is the question of controlling the cultivation of the hemp plant. The majority of the Collectors were for prescribing the limit of 10 or 15 tolas of ganja for possession without license, but the Board, agreeing with small minority that restrictions on the cultivation of the plant should precede those on possession, foresaw that any attempt at controlling hemp cultivation would involve the taking out of a license by every person who had a plant or two in his garden. The large undesirable increase to the existing number of shops which would have had to be sanctioned to meet the legitimate demands of consumers under the altered circumstances, as also the considerable additions which would have had to be made to the preventive force were also in the Board's opinion considerations which far outweighed any advantages which the proposed measure was expected to effect. The Board, therefore, came to the conclusion that such a regulation was neither desirable nor necessary, and the ques- tion of extending the provision of the Abkari Act to the cultivation of the plant and posses- sion and transport of drugs prepared therefrom was accordingly deferred. The above is a rsum of the correspondence that has passed between the Board of Rev- enue and the Madras Government on the subject of ganja administration in the Presidency. 9. Administration.84 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. Nothing is known of the extent to which wild hemp is found in the presidency, nor of its use for preparation of bhang or other narcotics. The average yield of ganja from the best description of plant is 41/2 visses or 221/2 seers of 24 tolas. The ordinary plant is not, however, so prolific as this, and the average yield may be set down at 2 visses or 10 seers of 24 tolas. As remarked in paragraph 8 supra, the cultivation of the hemp plant is unrestricted throughout the presidency. 11. Intoxicating drugs prepared from the hemp plant.MADRAS MEMORANDUM. 85 16.

88 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. BOMBAY MEMORANDUM. The system of administration in force in the Bombay Presidency in respect of intoxicat- ing drugs is practically uniform in the mofussil and the town and island of Bombay, but as there are some minor points of detail as to management in the hitter, which it is well should be set forth, I append the clear and succinct report of the Collector of Laud Revenue, Customs and Opium to explain those. 2. The chief points on which information is required by the Commission are mentionedBOMBAY MEMORANDUM. 89 of the Abkari Act, V of 1878, and the rules published in accordance with sections 27 and 30 thereof under Government Notification in the Revenue Department, No. 4421, dated 23rd August 1880. That notification with the forms attached of which a copy is appended, gives in a complete and intelligible form the whole system of the administration of revenue from in- toxicating drugs. It supplies almost completely answers to points (a) and (c) to (f) in the Note, and such further information as I can give will be supplementary and on matters of detail. 6. Regarding point (b) the information I have received from the various Collectors shows that wild hemp is not found anywhere in the presidency; as a consequence it is not used for the preparation of bhang or other narcotics, and it is therefore unnecessary to control the pos- session or sale of such drug. 7. Point (c).90 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. for the drug, and it will be gathered from what has been said above that the farm for the whole district being as a rule disposed of to a single vendor, the single shops are not sold by auction. In a few districts, however, the practice has been to sell single shops by auction, an upset price being fixed, but that practice has been stopped, and for the future the farm for the whole district will be sold to a single contractor. There is no fixed rule as to "local option." In some districts it is attended to carefully, in others the Collector uses his discre- tion according to the information he possesses as to the demand, but in all, any representation by the inhabitants for or against the establishment of a shop would have full consideration. Such representations, however, have seldom been made. 12. Point (h).BOMBAY MEMORANDUM. 91 From the above it will be observed that local ganja varies from Re. 0-3-0 to Rs. 2-8-0 per lb., that bhang is considerably cheaper, but that in Khandesh local ganja runs as high as Rs. 2-8-0 per lb., the same price as bhang imported from Ujjain, and that even the locally made bhang is dearer there than ganja in most other districts. 13. Point (i).92 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. dripping upon the 'lingam' of Mahadev from an earthen pot kept over it." Mr. Campbell, in paragraph 9 of his report, also alludes to the special consumption of bhang at the Shivaratri festival. The information that I have received from all districts in the presidency shows that moderate consumption of bhang mixed with water, milk, sugar, and spices into a cooling drink during the hot weather is a common practice amongst the fairly well-to-do classes, both of Hindus and Musalmans, and that (Question 33) it is not regarded as otherwise than respectable, it being a not unusual form of refreshment to offer to guests. Questions 34BOMBAY MEMORANDUM. 93 to the crops, almost all the female plants run into seeds, damaging the crops to a great extent. I am informed that separate plots of grounds were selected for growing the seeds. The ex- perts always walk through the crops, up-rooting the male plants, and this continues up to the time the crop is harvested and gathered. The owner of the ganja farm here has secured the services of an expert from Lengri, a village in the Khanapur Taluka of the Satara district, where the drug is grown on a large scale. Here the plants grow to a height of about 6 to 8 feet. In the fourth month the side pods and the leaves are stripped off with hands, and the crown pods are cut with a knife or a scythe. The pods and the leaves thus collected are stack- ed in a place, and are trodden while in green state for three or four days, and when dried they are winnowed and the pods are thus separated from the leaves; this latter stuff is called bhang-powder. The experts say that it is impossible to select the seeds which produce male plants. The plant is grown in this part of the country as a narcotic drug and not as a fibre plant. "4. The farm at Bijapur produced about 60 bags of ganja, each containing four maunds (a maund is equal to 960 tolas), worth about Rs. 180 in 1891. In the following year (1892) the yield was about four hundred maunds, worth about Rs. 800 after deducting the necessary expenses incurred in raising the crop, &c. The area sown was about 13 acres. "5. The purposes for which the drug and its by-products are used. Ganja. "Almost all the quantity of pods known as ganja is used up in smoking. Three to eight pods are smoked mixed with ordinary tobacco. The process of preparing the drug for the purpose of smoking consists in soaking the pods in cold water for a few minutes; they are then separated from the little stalks, and the seeds, if there be any, are thrown away. The pods thus soaked and cleaned are rubbed on the palm of the left hand with the right thumb for about a quarter of an hour, a small quantity of cold water being poured on it at short intervals and squeezed out. This rubbing is continued until the stuff gets sticky, and when this condition is obtained it is mixed with ordinary tobacco and smoked. The intoxicating property of the drug increases with the length of the time spent in rubbing it. The drug is also smoked as a medicine to check indigestion, especially in out-of-the-way places where medical aid is not available. It is largely used by the following classes of people:94 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. Boja. "9. This is one of the intoxicating preparations in which bhang powder has to be used. It is prepared as follows:BOMBAY MEMORANDUM. 95 4. Except a few women of loose character, the consumption of hemp-drugs is confined in Bombay to the male portions of the Hindu and Mahomedan communities. Ganja and charas are smoked with tobacco in the ordinary pipes or chilams; bhang and garda, the drop- pings of ganja, are drunk mixed with various spices; and the sweetmeats, mjum, ykuti, and gulkand, whose intoxicating qualities are due to the presence of bhang or garda, are eaten. The preparation and sale of blagolis, or children's pills, made with ganja instead of with opium, is now prohibited. 5. Ganja is smoked by Mahomedans of the working class, by fakirs or Mahomedan beg- gars, and by Hindu sadhus or ascetics, and labourers. Charas is smoked by Pathans, fakirs, sadhus, and people from Northern India. Bhang and garda are drunk by Mahomedans, and among Hindus by Brahmans, Banias, Bhatias, and other classes to whom their caste rules forbid the use of spirits. The sweetmeats mjum, ykuti, and gulkand are eaten chiefly by Hindus from Northern India. Garda is at times given to buffaloes and bhang to horses as a tonic. Except with the limitations of high caste and ascetic, bhang can hardly in Bombay be correctly described as the poor man's narcotic. 6. From the fairly trustworthy figures given in the statement marked A* it will be seen that about 345 Indian maunds of ganja and garda, about 481/2 Indian maunds of bhang, about 7 Indian maunds of charas, and 291/2 Indian maunds of mjum, ykuti, and gulkand are con- sumed annually in this collectorate. For the total male population of Hindus and Musalmans this would give an average yearly consumption per head of 2.50 tolas of ganja and garda, .35 tolas of bhang, .05 tolas of charas, and .21 tolas of mjum, ykuti, and gulkand. It is to be re- membered that habitual indulgence in these drugs is confined to a comparatively small number of persons, and that the very great majority of Hindus and Mahomedans either never use the drugs at all or only occasionally consume bhang and garda in the form of a drink. 7. The number of persons who habitually consume hemp-drugs in the island of Bombay is estimated at nearly 3,000. 2,000 of this number are put down as ganja smokers, 400 as bhang drinkers, 300 as garda drinkers, 100 as charas smokers, and 25 as daily consumers of mjum, ykuti, or gulkand. According to this estimate habitual consumers amount to 0.36 per cent. of the total population of the island and to .68 per cent. of the total males of the Hindu and Mahomedan communities. 8. The occasional or moderate use of hemp-drugs is believed not to be physically harmful. The immoderate use of these drugs gives rise to affections of the lungs, bowels, eye, and brain. The smoking of ganja, still more the smoking of charas, is considered the most baneful, and the drinking of bhang and garda the least harmful form in which hemp is used. Hemp-drugs are described as at once stimulating and sedative. They are said to have an exhilarating effect, to excite the imagination, to freshen the appetite, and to act as an aphrodisiac; excessive indul- gence in their use leads to indigestion, wasting, dropsy, impotence, melancholia, and in ex- treme cases, chiefly of charas and ganja smoking, even to insanity. 9. I see little reason to doubt that the prohibition or even the stringent restriction of the use of hemp-drugs would be resented by the people as an unjustifiable interference with their social customs, and would give rise to discontent. Ascetics, both Hindu and Mahomedan, use the drugs largely, and these men are regarded with veneration by, and have influence over considerable sections of the people. Though the inveterate or excessive use of these drugs is held discreditable, the occasional observance of the practice is not open to censure. The use of bhang is closely connected with the worship of the god Shiva or Mahadev. On Maha Shiv- ratri, the great night of Shiva in February, on the Mondays of August-September or Shravan,and at the spring festival of Shimga, the drinking of bhang, if not a binding, is an approved and usual practice. 10. If the use of hemp-drugs was prohibited, I think it pretty certain that many habitual and some occasional consumers would be driven to the use either of spirits or of opium. 11. In the town and island of Bombay the right to sell hemp-drugs is put to public auction by the Collector, and with the sanction of the Commissioner of Customs, Salt, Opium, and Abkari, is sold to the highest approved bidder. Notice that the right is to be put to public auction is given by advertisement in the Bombay Government Gazette and in some of the local newspapers. Printed slips are also circulated for the information of the Collectors of most of the districts in the presidency. The right is usually sold for a term of three years.

(4) That he will make his own arrangements for obtaining supplies of drugs, purchas- ing from licensed persons only, and obtaining the necessary permits for the import or transport of the drugs. That he will keep such minimum stocks of drugs in his shops as the Collector may direct. (5) That he will not sell drugs of bad quality likely to be obnoxious to the health of consumers. That he will not keep or sell balagolis or children's pills. (6) That any stocks of drugs remaining on hand on the expiry of the license shall be- come the property of Government. (7) That the farmer will keep and sell drugs at sanctioned shops only.

(9) That he will not sell more than 40 tolas of drugs to any one person on the same day. (10) That he will not receive any articles in barter for drugs. (11) That he will not open his shops before sunrise, and that he will close them at 11 P.M. That he will close his shops when ordered to do so by the Collector or Police Com- missioner, and of his own accord during a disturbance or riot (12) That he will prevent gaming and disorderly conduct in his shops, and will not allow notoriously bad characters to frequent them. That he will give information of suspected characters to a Magistrate or to the police. (13) That he will fix signboards at his shops. (14) That he will keep at his shops accounts of the receipts and sales of drugs, and pro- duce these accounts whenever required; that he will furnish all returns and in- formation required by the Collector. (15) That he shall use such weights and measures as the Collector may prescribe, and have them tested and stamped at his own expense at the Collector's office. (16) That he will not admit partners into his business without the permission of the Collector in writing. (17) That his license may be recalled for default in the punctual payment of duty, or for infringement by himself or by any of his servants of any of the conditions of the license, or for any breach of the Abkari law. If the license is recalled, the Collector may dispose of it or not as he thinks fit, and that the licensee shall con- tinue to be responsible for the instalments of duty. If the right of vend is transfer- red, the original licensee shall receive credit for payments by the new licensee up to the amount of duty still payable by the original licensee. He shall have no claim to profits made by the transfer. 13. Except that when purchasing in the Bombay Presidency, he must buy from a licens- ed seller, the farmer makes his own arrangements for obtaining supplies of the drugs. When he wishes to bring the drug to Bombay, the farmer makes a written application to the Collector, when an import or transport permit (forms forwarded marked respectively E* and F*) is grant- ed on payment of the duty sanctioned, viz.: If the quantity of the drug does not exceed 10 Indian maunds Rs. 5 For every additional 2 Indian maunds or fraction thereof Re. 1 A copy of the permit granted is sent by post to the Collector of the district from which the drug is to be brought. 14. On the arrival of the drugs in Bombay, a Sub-Inspector of the Abkari Department attends at the railway station, checks the weight of the packages, and if found correct, escorts the packages to the farmer's godown. From the godown the farmer sends the drugs to his shops under permits, a copy of which is forwarded, marked G.* * Not printed.
BOMBAY MEMORANDUM. 97 15. The statement marked H* shows the number of hemp-drug shops open in Bombay during each of the last five revenue years. The shops are shown in two classes: (a) those in which drugs are sold but not consumed on the premises, and (b) those in which drugs are sold and consumed on the premises. In the greater number of shops under the (a) or drug-selling class the business of selling drugs is combined with the sale of tobacco and pn-spari. The (b) or drug-consuming shops are places used solely for the sale and consumption of hemp-drugs. 16. Before a new shop can be opened, or an old shop be transferred from one place to another, the farmer must obtain the Collector's sanction. No opening of a fresh shop is allowed if the residents in the neighbourhood offer reasonable objections. 17. The Police Commissioner grants the police license required under Bombay Act XLVIII of 1860 for (b) or drug-consuming shops on payment of a nominal yearly fee of Re. (1) one. For the opening of a new or the transfer of an old drug-consuming shop the pre- vious approval of the Police Commissioner is also necessary. From the beginning of the current revenue year 72 hemp-drug shops have been open, of which 52 come under class (a)or drug-selling and 20 under class (b) or drug-consuming. 18. As the sole right of sale within the island belongs to the farmer, no wholesale drug shops occur in Bombay. Under a license granted by the Collector the farmer issues to his nominees nokarnamas or service certificates countersigned by the Collector. In these service certificates all the provisions of the license relating to the working of the shops are embodied. 19. The Bombay farmer is not required to sell drugs at any fixed price. The following table shows the present rates at which the farmer sells the different drugs to his nominees and the rates at which his nominees retail them to the public:98 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. given in statement A* considerable deductions from the I figures must be made for wastage and loss on account of spoiled drugs. From time to time quantities of these drugs are destroy- ed under the supervision of Abkari officers as unfit for sale. The quantities reported by the farmer to have been consumed in the island during the last two years are believed to be fairly correct. 23. The statement marked J* shows the total revenue derived from hemp-drugs during each of the past five revenue years. A comparison of the figures given in table J* with those in table I* shows for the five years that the incidence of duty on these drugs, excluding those used in the medicinal preparations, extract Cannabis Indica, amounts to Rs. 87.4 the Indian maund, that is, nearly Rs. 2.2 the seer. The largest item of revenue is the license fee. This has steadily increased for each successive term for which the license has been granted. For the present term, starting from 1st August 1893, the annual license fee payable is Rs. 48,000, that is, Rs. 8,500 more than the same fee paid for the previous term of three years. 24. The statement marked K* shows the exports of drugs by sea during the past five years. When drugs arrive by rail for export by sea, the weight of the packages is checked by an Abkari officer at the railway station. If the weight is found correct, the officer escorts the package to the docks or bandar and hands them to the Port Trust or Customs authorities. If the drugs arrive by water for transhipment and export, the Customs authorities supervise and allow the transhipment after the Abkari Department have endorsed on the covering permit that the transhipment is free from objection. The figures under "British Indian Ports" in- dicate exports to ports in British territory. Those under " Foreign Indian Ports" relate to ports within the limits of Native States. 25. The smuggling of hemp-drugs into Bombay cannot at present be said to prevail to any extent. Bona fide travellers may bring into Bombay 10 tolas of drugs from places with- out the presidency, and any person may bring 40 tolas of drugs into Bombay from a place within the presidency. The Abkari and Opium Departments have special establishments who watch the railway lines for smugglers. The Customs Department guard the sea front of the island. The present Bombay farmer also holds the hemp-drugs farm in the Thana district, and regulates the prices at Bandra, Kurla, and Thana so as to discourage people running out by rail to these places and bringing back with them less than 40 tolas of a drug. 26.

102 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. SIND MEMORANDUM. (a) There is one uniform system as regards the sale of hemp drugs for the province of Sind. The privilege of retail sale of bhang, ganja, charas, and majum in two or three talukas together, or in a sub-division, or in an entire district, is put up to public auction every year by the Collector in the month of July for the revenue year commencing with the 1st August and ending with 31st July of the following year, and sold generally to the highest bidder. Care is taken that the bidder whose bid is accepted bears a good character, and is able to furnish adequate security for the due performance of the conditions of the farm. Accompani- ment A* to this note is the form of license given to the farmer, who is allowed to open a certain number of shops within the limits of his farm. The retailers appointed by him for his shops are first approved by the taluka officials (Mukhtvarkars) and then 'parwanas' (permits to sell) are given to them by the Assistant Collector. The administration of the system is carried on by the Collector and his Assistants and Deputy Collectors, subject to the general control of the Commissioner in Sind. It is based on the Bombay Abkari Act, V of 1878, and the rules framed thereunder by Government and the Commissioner in Sind. (b) The wild hemp plant is not found in the province except near the hills to the west and on the border of Baluchistan. No attempt has been made to control its possession or sale. It is rarely used as an intoxicant, though it is believed that the intoxicating drugs prepared from it are much more potent than those made from the cultivated plant. (c) The hemp plant is grown only in very small quantities and in very few localities in Sind. The largest continuous area of cultivation is in Sehwan taluka of the Karachi district, and the bhang produced therefrom supplies the wants of the larger part of Sind. There is no restriction whatever on the cultivation of bhang, but certain restrictions are imposed after the crop has been reaped, in so far that the cultivator is not allowed to convert the produce into bhang without the permission of the sub-divisional officer, and may not dispose of it by sale to any other than the licensed farmer for the particular area in which his crop is situated. Neither ganja nor charas are produced in Sind, but are imported, the former from Panwel in the Kolaba district and the latter from Amritsar. Bhang is the only preparation made from the hemp plant in Sind. The area under cultivation in the Karachi, Hyderabad, and Shikar- pur districts for some years past is shown in the statement B attached to this report. (d) The bhang farmer also buys the right to import charas and ganja; he imports them under permits from the Collector and stores them in his own warehouses and distributes them among his retail shopkeepers. Supervision is provided for under the Bombay Abkari Act in the same manner as that described by the Honourable Mr. Mackenzie in his Note. On the arrival of any consignment of charas or ganja the quantity is tested and compared with the permit under which it has been imported. (e) The cultivator may be considered to be the wholesale dealer, and, as already said, he requires no license; nor does the contractor or farmer require any license beyond the general license which he buys at auction for the right to sell the different hemp drugs. The retail vendors, who are the contractor's servants, procure licenses from the Assistant Collector on the application of the contractor. The stock in hand as well as the accounts of these retail licensecs are examined by the sub-divisional officers, by the Mukhtyarkars, Abkari Inspectors, and Police officers. (f) No direct tax on bhang, ganja, and other drugs is levied; the only tax being an in- direct tax in the shape of the amount for which the right to retail is purchased by auction, the amount is levied in advance by instalments. (g) The number and localities of the shops are fixed by the Collector with due regard to the requirements of each part of the district and with reference also to area and population. No fees are levied for shops, as all the shops situated in any particular district or sub-division are owned by, and are under the control of the farmer of that district or sub-division, and licenses are granted tree to persons named by him. The farmer cannot add to the number of shops when once fixed by the Collector without the sanction of the Collector, nor can he close or alter the locality of any shop without permission. There is nothing in Sind in the nature of 'local option'; but of course any representations for or against the opening of shops in any particular localities by the residents of those localities would influence the Collector's decision. But owing to the very limited consumption in Sind of the hemp products, such re- presentations or interference on the part of the people are practically unknown. (h) No rate is fixed at which bhang, &c., must be supplied by wholesale dealers (i.e., the cultivators) to retail dealers, and the retail price varies in every district. * Not printed.

106 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. BERAR MEMORANDUM. A. Extent to which the hemp plant is cultivated in Berar. A statement showing the area under hemp plant during the past 16 years is appended, and from that it will be seen that in Berar there is very little of hemp cultivation. It is only confined to a small tract of the Akola and the Buldana districts in the vicinity of the town of Khamgaon and to some villages in the Morsi Taluk. In the excise report for 1880-81 Mr. Jones has given a list of villages in which ganja was cultivated in that year, but since then the cultivation has decreased and all the villages mentioned there do not now cultivate ganja. The list given by Mr. Jones is appendedBERAR MEMORANDUM. 107 The manner in which the plant is cultivated for the production of drugs and the method of preparing the manu- factured drug from the raw product whether the wild or the domesticated plant.

[APP. preparation is then filtered, and the fluid essence is mixed with spices such as jaiphal, jaipatri, kalmi, vilaichi, lavang, khurasni wora; sugar is then separately boiled, and when it is found to be quite clean and ready for being mixed with the above preparations, it is so mixed, and the whole thing is once more boiled. This preparation is called majum, which is of a green colour. I have obtained this information from a well known majum-seller at Ballapur, whose preparation is celebrated in the province and it is in many places called by name " Deolal," who was the original owner of the shop. This "Deolal" is used by many people known to be respectable. There is another preparation similar to the above and is called the gulab shakri majum. It is the same as the above, but is coloured red by mixing a small quantity of hingul. Gulkand.What proportion of the population habitually consume hemp-drugs? Is the use of hemp drugs a frequent cause of lunacy? There is no reliable data to form an estimate of the proportion of the population habi- tually consuming hemp-drugs, but one per cent. can be taken as an approximately correct estimate for Berar. Generally, as above said, this drug is consumed by Fakeers, Bairagis and Sanyasis, etc., who come to the province as wanderers; very few people indigenous to Berar are addicted to the use of these drugs. Instances are known when excessive use of ganja-smoking has led to lunacy, but there is nothing to show that it frequently causes lunacy. Whether the consumption of hemp drug is either harmless or beneficial. If so, in what form? Consumption of bhang as a drink is considered to be harm- less and even beneficial. Smoking ganja is not considered beneficial. Administrative arrangement in force in Berar for controlling the growth of the plant, the manufacture and sale of the drug and their importations from other provinces or from Native States, and for imposing duties on cul- tivation and sale. Please see memorandum drawn up under instructions received from the Secretary, Hemp Drugs Commission, in his letter No. 28, dated 11th August 1893. Danger resulting from prohibition or restrictive measures of a stringent character. Would it give rise to seri- ous discontent and be resented by the people as an unjustifiable interference with long-established social customs? In this respect the Deputy Commissioner of Amraoti says:- "As has been said above, a very small portion of the entire community is addicted to the use of the drug. Its prohibition in entirety may lead to discontent, but imposition of restric- tive measures will not be resented. But serious discontentment would result in Amraoti dis- trict if even stringent measures were adopted. Smuggling by Marwaris would increase, as they are generally men of money. Detection would be difficult." The Deputy Commissioner of Akola says:- "The smokers of ganja, when compared with the total population, are not a large number, and so if the cultivation is stopped, of course the smokers will suffer for a time and they will show discontent, but it will wear off in course of time: probably the ganja-smokers would be driven to other stimulants." The Deputy Commissioner, Buldana, says:110 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. So by stopping the use of the drug those who use majum would not suffer. The only people who might be discontented would be mendicants and a few Marwaris, who would console themselves with opium as a substitute, which would be beneficial in comparison to the drug, which is injurious." Any reforms or improvement for controlling the cultivation of the hemp plant and the manufacture, sale and taxation of hemp-drug? No Deputy Commissioners have suggested any improvements desirable. The only thing that was needed has been already effected. From the next year the farm of these drugs will be sold separately from the opium farm.
BERAR MEMORANDUM. 111 BERAR MEMORANDUM. B. The administration of hemp drugs in the Hyderabad Assigned Districts is regulated by the Abkari rules, copies of which have been sent to Secretary, Hemp Drugs Commission. Opium and hemp drugs in the Hyderabad Assigned Districts are treated in one farm, and where opium shops exist, hemp drugs are allowed to be sold. This farm is worked uniformly throughout all the districts in the Hyderabad Assigned Districts by the Deputy Commissioners through their tahsildars. There are no separate Excise officers to control the vend of drugs. A monopoly of the right to vend is sold by auction each year by the Deputy Commissioners under the orders of the Commissioner, and the highest bidder usually obtains it and is licensed. The opium and hemp drugs farm being sold together, the proceeds are credited to opium and drugs. No information is, therefore, separately available as to the value of hemp drugs, and hence the columns requiring this information in the appended statement C are left blank. It is, however, supposed that the revenue from hemp drugs is about one anna in the rupee, or 1/16th of the value of the whole farm auctioned. This statement is based on enquiries made of the farmers, and as nothing certain can be obtained, I have omitted these figures from statement C. The question of separating the sales of hemp drugs from opium has been very recently taken up, and it has been decided to separate them from the 1st April 1894. I now turn to the points mentioned in the note accompanying letter No. 28, dated 11th August 1893, and take them seriatim. Control of the growth of the hemp plant. *Notification No. 55, dated 5th Aug- ust 1874. Up to the year 1875 the cultivation of ganja and bhang was not restricted in Berar. Rules regulating and restricting the cultivation of ganja and bhang in the Hyderabad Assigned Districts were first issued* in the year 1874 and were brought into force from the 1st of April 1875. Under these rules the cultivation of ganja and bhang was strictly prohibited except under a license. The Deputy Commissioners were authorized to grant such licenses, and they had to be written on a stamp paper of Rs. 8 (to be supplied by the cultivator) without reference to the area cultivated. Under these rules the village officers were bound to make immediate reports of unlicensed cultivation, and the Deputy Commissioners were authorized to cause the destruction of such crops and plants of spontaneous growth. Cultivators of unlicensed ganja and bhang crops were made liable to a fine not exceeding one hundred rupees for each offence, and half the fines realized were made payable to informants as rewards. The effect of these rules was that the cultivation of ganja was confined to a very few villages in the Akola, Buldana and the Amraoti districts, the villages in the first two districts being mostly in the vicinity of the town of Khamgaon and those of the Amraoti district in the Morsi taluk of that district. Table A appended to this will show the extent of ganja cultivation in the Hyderabad Assigned Districts between the years 1877-78 to 1892- 93, inclusive, and from the figures it will be observed that it has been very limited. The above rules remained in force without any change till the year 1884, when they were modified by increasing the fee for cultivation from Rs. 8 per license to Rs. 10 per acre or part of an acre cultivated. This had the effect of further curtailing the cultivation of ganja, vide figures in Table A. From the year 1885-86 the cultivation has gone down immensely. At the time these modifications were made the Commissioner made it obligatory on the vendors of ganja and bhang to keep accounts of their receipts and disbursements. These modifications were originally introduced as a tentative measure, but have since been continued. As it is, the amount of land cultivated is very insignificant: on an average of the past seven years it is about 55 acres per year in the whole province. The rules of 1875, therefore, with the modifications of 1884, are the rules at present in force, and so far as is known works satisfactorily. Manufacture or importation and sale of hemp drugs. As already stated, the farm for manufacture, etc., of hemp drugs is given out with the opium farm, and consequently these drugs are manufactured, imported, and sold by opium vendors only. The manner of manufacturing these drugs is described in the Memoran- dum A, which is separately submitted.
112 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. The local produce is not sufficient for the wants of the province, and therefore ganja is imported usually from Khandwa in the Central Provinces, sometimes from Khandesh in the Bombay Presidency. No duty is levied on importations. On an average it is estimated that about 800 maunds of ganja is annually imported into the Province; this with the ganja locally produced is apparently sufficient for the requirements of the people who in- dulge in this drug. There is no means of ascertaining what portion of the population indulges in hemp drugs; therefore any calculations require us to deal with the entire census population or the total of the male and female adult population. The Hyderabad Assigned Districts' total population by last census is 2,897,040; the adult population, male and female, is 1,794,174. Now 800 maunds are on the average imported per annum, and about 500 raised locally, which gives a total of 1,300 maunds. If this were all consumed, it would mean on the whole population 14 tolas per head: on adults 23 tolas per head per annum. The 500 maunds estimated as on the average to be locally raised is arrived at by assuming that the 55 acres, the average of the past seven years, under hemp gives 10 maunds per acre. In reality the farmers' returns of consumption (column 42, statement C) are wholly unreliable; therefore I have taken the whole produce raised locally and imported, to calculate the incidence per head of consumption, as a safer guide. Duties imposed. No duties are imposed on hemp drugs. The only revenue that is derived from these drugs is the price of the farm combined with opium and the license fee on cultivation. No fee is levied on the licenses for importation. They are granted free to the licensed vendors. The above information applies to ganja and bhang. Charas is not used in the province. There is only one kind of ganja in the province, and that is the flat ganja. (a) The system of administration throughout the province is uniform. The central controlling authority is the Deputy Commissioner of the district. The administration is carried on by the tahsildars with the assistance of the village officers. The following are Abkari officers under the rules:- Deputy Commissioners, Assistant Commissioners, Tahsildars, Naib-Tahsildars, and Police officers of a rank not below that of Inspectors and chief constables in charge of police stations. (b) Wild hemp is not found in the province. (c) As above stated, the cultivation of the hemp plant for the production of ganja or bhang is prohibited except under a license. It is not restricted to any particular locality. It is evident that as the area locally under hemp is small that it is more paying to import the drug than to cultivate it. (d) The opium and drug farmers are the only importers of ganja and bhang. No charas is imported. All the Abkari officers mentioned above have power to inspect the shops establish- ed by the farmers, and to check the actual balance with the entries in the books kept; and if any irregularities are discovered, the farmers are liable to be prosecuted under the Abkari Rules, section 43. All importers of ganja or bhang are required to take out a pass from the Deputy Commissioner. No arrangements are made for controlling the storing or transport of these drugs. (e) The farmers are the wholesale and retail vendors. Those in the retail trade keep books showing their sales, and they are prohibited from selling more than 20 tolas of ganja and bhang to one person and are forbidden to allow the drug to be smoked on the premises. Their shops are occasionally inspected by Abkari officers to enforce these orders. (f) The only direct or indirect tax on ganja in this province is the money paid by the farmer and the fee paid by the cultivator for a license. The latter is recover- able as arrears of land revenue and cannot possibly be evaded. The former, if not paid, is recoverable under rule 15 of the Abkari Rules by attachment and sale of moveable property of the farmer within the jurisdiction of the Deputy Commissioner. At the time of the sales precautions are taken to ascertain that the farmer's securities are men of substance, and that they possess moveable pro- perty sufficient to cover the amount tendered by the farmer for which they go security.
BERAR MEMORANDUM. 113 (g) Up to the present wherever an opium shop was permitted there hemp drugs could be sold. In future, guided mainly by the requirements of the trade, Deputy Commissioners have fixed hemp drug shops in a few localities; in all 229 shops will next year be open. This on an area of over 17,000 square miles means one shop to every 74 square miles of country. There is nothing in the nature of local option; but if the people of any certain locality object to have a shop in their midst, the Deputy Commissioner, as against the trade, considers their objections. (h) No rate is fixed at which the drug must be supplied by the wholesale to the retail vendor. This is left to private contract. The average retail price to consumers varies from Rs 2 per seer to Rs. 2.4 in the Amraoti District. The Deputy Commissioner of Akola gives the prices in his district as below:114 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. Statistics relating to hemp drugs in the Hyderabad Year.

[APP. COORG MEMORANDUM. The answers refer to ganja, which is called indifferently in Coorg, ganja or bhang. Charas is unknown. Only one system in the small province of Coorg. The Commissioner of the province is head of the Excise. Two Inspectors of Excise and six other officials under the Commissioner. On Act No. XXII of 1881, an Act to amend the law relating to Excise Revenue in Northern India, British Burma, and Coorg. On the rules framed in conformity with sections 11, 12, 20, and 55 of that Act, sanctioned by the Chief Commissioner of Coorg as the chief revenue authority in the province, having effect from 19th May 1882. I am doubtful whether wild hemp is actually found, but hemp springs up in the coffee near cooly lines and near the huts of the wild tribes and no one owns to its cultivation. A cooly in weeding the coffee will try to avoid pulling up the plant unless his master happens to be looking. Impossible to say with any degree of accuracy, but as the contractor has not complained, and I have had no complaints from planters as to their coolies being stupefied by the drug, pro- bably to a very limited extent indeed. No attempt has been made to control the possession of such drug. If its sale was at- tempted to any extent, it would come to the ears of the licensed vendor, and the seller would be prosecuted, but I have heard of no such cases. Cultivation not prohibited, but a license must be taken out first. As a matter of a fact, however, hemp is not cultivated in the province. To none, if a license is asked and given, but, as already stated, the plant is not cultivated in Coorg. No ryot or other person is allowed to cultivate hemp without a license from the Parpattegar; the Excise and village officers would report any such case. There have been a few prosecu- tions of people for growing a few plants of hemp near their huts in the last two or three years. This has checked the practice somewhat. Only one-the contractor. If a ryot did cultivate for export, he would have to obtain a special pass under rule 33, but no such case has occurred. The contractor, being the sole importer, makes his own arrangements for the import, storing, and transport of the drug. For the import a license is re- quired. Licenses are granted by the farmer, who is the wholesale vendor and has to keep accounts: the retail vendors are selected by the farmer, but must be approved by the Commissioner, who countersigns the licenses. They are visiied by the Excise officers, accounts inspected, and fortnightly returns of results reported. License holders can sell for ready money only and not more than 1/4 of a seer of ganja and 5 tolas of majum. There is no tax on ganja and other hemp drugs. The right to procure and sell ganja is leased out for 3 years to the farmer whose tender has been approved of. If the contractor fails to pay on the appointed dates the instalments due, the contract is liable to be cancelled. Besides the contract amount a fee of one rupee per mensem for each shop at Mercara and Vira- jendrapett, and of annas 8 in other places is paid. No special precautions against evasions are taken; the vendors who have licensed shops, even if any unlicensed shops escaped the notice of the officials, would at once bring the matter to the notice of the Excise Department. One shop has been allowed to each of the 6 taluks or sub-divisions of Coorg except to the Nanjarajpatana Taluk, in which there are two, one at head-quarters and one in the municipal town of Somvarpett. No local option is recognized. At the same time the Commissioner would never sanction the opening of a shop unless the inhabitants either petitioned for it or were willing to have it. No, the contractor makes his own arrangements. He sells at from 10 to 12 annas a seer to the retail vendors, and they sell at from 14 annas to one rupee to the public.
COORG MEMORANDUM. 121 Yes, a vendor must not sell to any individual in one day more than 1/4 seer 1/4 ganja and 5 tolas of majum except to the holder of a pass from a Magistrate. No minimum price is fixed for the drug. No smuggling from other provinces or from the Native State of Mysore has been brought to notice. There have been 8 prosecutions in the last two years for illicit cultivation, but they have been only small cases of a few plants found in compounds by the Excise officers. No special measures have had to be taken to prevent it. None. Is practically nil. (Extent of cultivation). Confined to the Government farmer. 411/2 maunds in 1891-92. Amount of probable consumption. 56 maundsin 1892-93. Rupees 798 per annum-Revenue. The Excise officers send in to the Commissioner a diary fortnightly as regards the ganja shops. The vice of ganja-smoking to excess is comparatively rare in the province. Kurumbaars, the wild tribe most addicted to it, are a peculiarly inoffensive non-criminal tribe: the Yerwars and Kapilas, who also smoke ganja, are more troublesome, though not by any means habitual criminals.

128 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. KASHMIR STATE MEMORANDUM. 1. Cultivation of hemp does not prevail in Kashmir. 2. The hemp plant, however, grows spontaneously throughout Kashmir proper. 3. It is abundant in Wantipora, Haripore, and Anantnag tahsils of the Anantnag district, and in the Nagam tahsil of the Srinagar District, growing on both banks of the river Jhelum and Arveni and Kaimu nallahs. 4. The growth of wild hemp is ordinarily dense. Almost all wild hemp which is called Talia in the Punjab, and is generally female plant in the above-mentioned tahsils, is used for the preparation of ganja locally known by name gard bhang (chura charas). 5. The total quantity of gard bhang annually manufactured in ordinary years is about 70 maunds, but in the year Sambat 1950 the total production of ganja amounted to about 35 maunds, the hemp plant having been considerably damaged by the recent flood. 6. Four hundred maunds of fibre are annually produced, but, for reasons stated above, the total quantity of fibre in Sambat 1950 amounted to 160 maunds only. 7. Down the city on both banks of the river Jhelam wild hemp known as Kathiya bhang does not produce gard bhang (chura charas), and it is only used for its fibre and twigs for burning. 8. About 600 maunds of fibre is annually produced down the river and in the Utarmachi- pura and Sri Pratap Singhpura tahsils and ilaqa Magan of the Pattan Tahsil and Khinhama. 9. Zamindars pay to the lessee fixed amount as duty which varies according to the extent of the growth for the fibre and twigs of the hemp plant growing down the city and in the tahsils mentioned in paragraph 8. 10. The leaves of the hemp plant are trodden under foot, and cleaned by sieve to prepare gard bhang, and this process is continued until the leaves are reduced to powder and seeds separated. This is always done by lessee in Srinagar, where the leaves are brought to undergo this process of manufacture. 11. Manufacture and sale of gard bhang (chura charas) and fibre are auctioned, and the highest bid in the current year, Sambat 1950, amounted to Rs. 3,240. 12. The monopoly of sale is practically given to the lessee, who appoints his own men for retail sale and makes his own arrangements for control of the growth of the wild hemp plant, the production of the ganja, and for its fibre. 13. The number and sites of retail shops are not fixed, and it is optional for the lessee to open retail shops at suitable places not objected to by the people according to the require- ments of the consumers. 14. The maximum quantity for retail sale to, or possession by, the ordinary consumers of gard bhang is 5 tolas. 15. No minimum price is fixed for " gard bhang," but it is usually sold at 3 pice per tola. 16. Illicit sale to, and possession of gard bhang by, consumers in excess of the maximum amount are now generally dealt with on the criminal side under the State Penal Code for disobedience of rules duly promulgated. The rules are, however, defective and make no provision for prosecuting a man manufacturing ganja without a license or destroying the wild hemp plant, or for other similar cases, or binding the lessee to keep up register of produce of the drugs and sale. Framing of the new rules as more effective preventive measures for such purposes is under consideration. 17. The illicit sale of the Yarkand charas apparently prevails, but to a very small extent, as the Yarkand charas is not liked by the Kashmiris, which is the only drug passing through Kashmir for British India. 18. The drug being usually leased, lessee makes his own arrangements for prevention of the illicit sale, as he does for the control of the growth of the plant. The contractor of duty on custom and octroi also in his own interest has supervision on the Yarkand charas to see that it passes the country sealed intact, as, if sold in the city, he is entitled to duty on the same.
KASHMIR STATE MEMORANDUM. 129 19. The annual consumption of the ganja or locally known gard bhang (chura charas) is about 63 maunds, or, in other words, the entire quautity thus manufactured is locally consumed. 20. The gard bhang as produced in this province is of inferior quality, and being not liked by the people in British India its smuggling is of rare occurrence, or in fact I cannot quote a single case of this nature. 21. In the present year lessee, on account of damage done to the hemp plant by the recent flood, could not produce more than 35 maunds, and he had therefore purchased the Yarkand charas passing through Kashmir to meet the local requirements by mixing the Yarkand charas with the local produce, foreign produce being not liked by the consumers, generally. 22. Green or dry leaves of bhang are not sold for drinking and smoking. Bhang is very seldom used in this province for drinking and it is not at all used for smoking, and the people drinking it, whose number can hardly be more than 200, clean the dry leaves in their houses and roast them a little. A few dry leaves are put in a koondi with some black-pepper to prepare a fluid, and sometimes sugar also is mixed to make the liquid sweet to the taste. There is no prohibition for possession of the bhang leaves in any quantity. 23. Bhang is also used in the preparation of majum, which is eaten to some extent by the Hindustanis and well-to-do Kashmiris. 24. The quantity of majum does not exceed one maund a year. 25. Majum is manufactured by slightly boiling leaves, which are taken out of water and put into hot ghi; ghi possessing narcotic properties when mixed with ata and sugar makes majum for eating, but there are no habitual eaters of majum. 26. Cultivation of hemp in this province is only impossible on the hills; and, excepting the stony lands, it can be cultivated throughout the province; but on account of the wild hemp, the growth of which is abundant throughout Kashmir proper, cultivation of the plant does not prevail at all, though not prohibited by the State. 27. Higher up the river in the three tahsils of the Anantnag district and in the Nagam tahsil of the Srinagar district the hemp plant is cut by the zemindars of the neighbouring villages in the month of Kartik, lessee on behalf of the State, when hemp and manufacture of ganja are auctioned, receiving leaves of the plant in full and half of the fibre, the rest half of the fibre and the twigs going to the zemindars in lieu of their wages. 28. Ganja does keep good with ordinary care in skins of sheep at most for two years after which it quite loses its effect, and no measure can prevent its deterioration. If not carefully kept free from wet and atmosphere, it loses its effect earlier than this. 29. Fakirs and a few Musalmans and Pandits of the Srinagar city and towns smoke gard bhang (chura charas). 30. The villagers are not accustomed to these drugs. 31. The total number of persons who do smoke ganja is in this province approximately 2,000, and including the people of British India, the servants of visitors in spring, and the fakirs visiting the country on pilgrimage, the number may fairly be taken as 2,500, and they can be classed as follows:130 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. the population of the province, which, according to the recent census, is 949, 041 souls, the number of consumers of gard bhang is very email, and in case of entire prohibition, which may give rise to discontent among the habitual consumers, it cannot amount at all to a poli- tical danger in the Kashmir Province. 36. The area under the wild bhang being not measured and the lessees being not required under the rules to keep up registers, I cannot furnish information by years as asked for in the statement. I, however, give revenue on account of hemp drugs for the last twenty years. I could not get any further information for compilation of the statement, and it is impossible to prepare statement without such information as far as figures by years are con- cerned. Year. Revenue.

The ganja of this part of the country is of two kinds, the stem of one is white and of the other black: the latter is better than the former. Some of the plants of both kinds bear flowers, and such plants are no good. The plant which does not bear flowers, and the fine leaves of which get twisted together, is the ganja. The method of preparation is as follows:132 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1493-89 [APP. MEMORANDUM ON THE SYSTEM OF ADMINISTRATION IN HIS HIGHNESS THE NIZAM'S DOMINION IN RESPECT TO THE HEMP DRUGS. I.HYDERABAD MEMORANDUM. 133 Re. 1 to 11/2 per seer, who sell it to the consumers at the rate of one tola from about 1/4 to 1/2an oz. for a quarter of an anna, the bhang from 1 to 2 ozs. for the same money, and the majum about one ounce for one anna. As far as my inquiries go, about the same prices seem to prevail in all parts of the domi- nion in an ordinary year; but in a bad year, and when ganja is imported from outside of the State and for which the custom duty at the rate of Rs. 10 per maund is paid, the price rises. In some part it has been double last year, as owing to the excess of rain the ganja crop had failed. 8. No maximum or minimum price or amount is fixed by the Government for any kind of sale, or possession by ordinary consumers, or for retail sale of the drugs. 9. As enough of the hemp is grown in this country, as it is quite a cheap thing, as stated before, and as the customs duty is a great check upon its trade, consequently there is no temptation for any kind of smuggling from other provinces or any other Native State, the illicit cultivation, possession, or the sale of the drugs; hence no special measures to prevent this are necessary. 10. As the Government revenue from this source is very limited and the consumption of the drugs is not great, therefore the modifications of the present excise system have not attracted any particular attention. However, at any want of the kind being felt, due actions certainly will be taken by the Excise Commissioner. III.134 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. The above statement is exclusive of the monopoly given by the Sarfkhas, Paigha, and Jagirs, for which no statistics are available. The Government revenue from the custom duties on the import and export of ganja and bhang for the last five years has been as follows:MYSORE MEMORANDUM. 135 MEMORANDUM ON GANJA IN MYSORE BY MR. L. RICKETTS, EXCISE COMMISSIONER. What variety of Indian hemp is utilized for ganja in Mysore? 1. The species of Indian hemp which is in use in the Mysore Province, under the appel- lation of "ganja" in Hindustani, or "Bangi-soppu" in Kanarese, is what is generally known as the Cannabis saliva of Linn. The plant is cut during inflorescence with the resin carefully preserved on the leaves, dried and made into bundles. Cultivation of Indian hemp restricted. 2. The cultivation of the above hemp in Mysore is forbidden except under a free license granted by the Deputy Commissioner of the district on condi- tion that, within one month after the preparation of ganja, the latter shall be sold to the licensed ganja contractor at a fair valuation, or exported under the Deputy Commissioner's pass, and that the licensee may, if he so desires, retain for his own private consumption ganja not exceeding 14 lbs., provided that the area of the land cultivated with hemp is not less than one acre. Except in three or four small plots of land in which the licensed cultivators failed from inexperience to make proper ganja, no attempt has been made by any one to grow the hemp in this province, evidently owing to the cultivators of land being ignorant as to the stage of growth when the plants should be cut so as to be fit for ganja. Therefore the ganja required for consumption in this province is imported from the Madras Presidency. Wild hemp is nowhere found in this province. Self-sown hemp is occasionally to be met with in gardens and backyards of native houses; but when found they are immedi- ately uprooted and destroyed. What admixtures of ganja are in use, and mode of preparation? 3. Besides the pure ganja, the only preparations of it generally used and recognized in this province are majum and halva. Majum is a condiment made with ganja powder and other materials in the following proportions:136 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. Wholesale rates. 6.

Mode of disposal of retail vend. 19. The right of retail vend is not disposed of generally by public auction. But when more than one application is received for one and the same shop, the Deputy Commissioner of the district concerned sometimes puts it up to auction. When an application for a license to sell the drugs is received, the local residents and officials are consulted; and if the want for a shop is really felt, the license is granted by the Deputy Commissioner with the previous sanction of the Excise Commissioner, the site for the shop being fixed by the Deputy Commissioner. Preventive measures. 20. In addition to the establishment of a separate excise state for the prevention and detection of clandestine cultivation and import of ganja, the members of the Police Revenue Sayer, Octroi, and Municipal Departments have been appointed as Excise officers under sections 24 and 34A. of the Excise Act. Illicit cultivation and smuggling are not carried on to any appreciable extent. How and by what classes of people ganja is consumed, and its effects? 21. Ganja is used for smoking by simply crushing the dry leaves and mixing them with tobacco in the proportion of two parts of the former to one part of the latter. Majum and halva are generally eaten in sweetmeats. An infusion of the withered flowers of the hemp plant is occasionally made and mixed with pepper, poppy-seed, and fried Bengal gram, the preparations being either diluted and drunk under the name of "ramras," or made up into pills and swallowed, or dissolved in jaggery water and milk or expressed juice of the cocoanut and drunk under the name of "bhang." The generality of the consumers are said to be Mahomedans, many of whom are idle and disreputable men of the lower classes, as also Bairaghis, Gosayis, Rajputs, and a few other Hindus. It is represented that where the quantity consumed is below 2 tolas weight, it does not produce any bad effects; but where this is exceeded, stupefaction or even temporary insanity is the result. In the Lunatic Asylum, Bangalore City, instances were to be met with of patients affected by excessive use of ganja. The Excise Commissioner is, however, not aware of any instances in which crime was excited under its influence or permanent insanity was produced by it. He is informed that it tends to affect the nervous system and undermine the constitution gradually. Ganja revenue. 22. The revenue from ganja for the past 20 years is as per particulars below:MYSORE MEMORANDUM. 139 that year consisted of 15 months, during which period the revenue amounted to Rs. 15,517, the average for 12 months being Rs. 12,414. As the ganja contract of the Civil and Military Station of Bangalore has been given out separately by the Resident since the year 1886-87, the ganja revenue thereof is not included in the abovementioned figures from 1886-87. Consumption of ganja. The total consumption of the drugs in 1892-93 was 41,326 seers. Incidence of consumption per head of population. The incidence of consumption per head of population in 1892-93 was one-fifth of a tola. Incidence of ganja revenue. The incidence of ganja revenue per head of population in 1892-93 was  pie. Comparison with arrack and toddy revenue. The arrack and toddy revenue for 1892-93 being Rs. 15,92,475-5-6 and Rs. 13,89,054-8-8, respectively, the ganja revenue for the same year is incon- siderable when compared with the arrack and toddy revenue and also with the total population of the province, excluding the Civil and Military Station of Bangalore, namely, 4,843,523 inhabitants.

The new rules (draft) printed and sent up to, and now before the Mysore Government, were originally drawn up by me in 1889, in co-operation with Colonel Campbell, the first Excise Commissioner in Mysore. For the purposes of the present enquiry I have made it my special duty to conduct personally a thorough investigation again into the whole subject, and the results recorded in this paper have thus the benefit of having been effected by an officer who has had 14 years' experience of this subject, and who has, moreover, been brought in con- stant and direct contact with both sellers and consumers at Bangalore and throughout the Mysore State during his tours of inspection. To render this paper as complete as possible I have enlisted the aid of a medical practitioner to give me the help required to dispose of the medico-legal queries put by the "Indian Hemp Drugs Commission."

MEMORANDUM BY COLONEL MAGRATH, DISTRICT MAGISTRATE AND COLLECTOR, CIVIL AND MILITARY STATION OF BANGALORE. The system which controls the sale of the drugs commonly known as ganja and majum in the Civil and Military Station is almost the same as that prevailing in the Mysore State. Up to 31st March 1886 the contract of the Civil and Military Station for raising Government revenue was joint with that of the Mysore Darbar, the assigned tract receiving its share proportionately on the population. Since 1886-87 the contract is distinct, but the Darbar's subordinate executive staff for city also exercise supervision over the wholesale and retail drug shops in the Civil and Military Station under the orders of the Collector, the cost of establish- ment being also proportionately adjusted annually between the two tracts. The rules framed (copy enclosed) by the Resident under the Excise Act provide for the control of the growth of the Indian hemp plant from which ganja is prepared; there was no occasion to issue a license for its cultivation. The drug is easily imported by the licensed contractor from Vellore and Cocanada in the Madras Presidency. The Cocanada drug is much appreciated by the consumers in this province; better sales and greater revenue are effected by such drug. The bulk of the drug imported lately has been that of Vellore. Appendix N of the ganja rules gives a full description of the drugs known in this country as ganja, majum, and bhang used by consumers in Civil and Military Station. Charas is little known in this country. (a) The system obtaining in the Civil and Military Station is briefly stated above. The chief executive officer is the Collector; the Resident is the chief controlling authority. Act XXII of 1881, as amended by subsequent enactments and the rules framed thereunder by the Resident, is the law on which the system is based. (b) Wild hemp is scarcely grown in Civil and Military Station. Any plant found growing spontaneously is uprooted by the Excise officers and destroyed under the Collector's orders. (c) The cultivation of the hemp plant in Civil and Military Station is interdicted, but there were two or three instances within the last seven years in which persons, in spite of Government order to stop the growth, allowed the growth of one or two plants in each case in the backyards of their houses and in the fence of their gardens. They were prosecuted and punished. (d) The importer of the ganja drug is the contractor for Civil and Military Station. He is also the wholesale vendor. Whenever the contractor wants to lay in a stock according to the terms of his agreement, an import pass is issued by the Collector for the required quantity. This pass is produced by him before the executive revenue officer of the district from whence the drug is imported. He is thereafter allowed to purchase the drug to the extent permitted in the import pass. On the arrival of the consignment of the drugs in Civil and Military Station, the Government Head Supervisor verifies the quantity with the Collector's pass and then it is booked and stored in the Government warehouse. The daily issues by the wholesale to retail vendor are checked by the Excise officers. (e) The wholesale and retail vendors are under the control of the officers of the Excise department. They are licensed; full details of the conditions and restric- tions will be found in Appendices B, H, and I of the Ganja Rules. (f) The tax or duty on ganja is levied through the licensed contractor. The contract generally extends for a period of three years at a time. Government duty is fixed at the rate of 6 annas for ganja and 2 annas for majum on a seer of 24 tolas. The contractor guarantees a fixed minimum annual revenue to Govern- ment which he is allowed to pay into Government treasury by twelve equal monthly instalments. If the sales in any month are found to realize more than the guaranteed revenue for that month, then an excess fee at the above rate is levied from the contractor; if deficient, the contractor will make good. He is, however, allowed credit for this deficiency in excess sales (if any) in any subsequent month within the same official year. Illicit smuggling of ganja tending to evasion of payment of duty is made punishable. All officers of police and municipality take precautions against smuggling; persons detected are prosecuted by the Excise executive officers before the magistracy. (g) The sites for retail shops are fixed by the Collector in consultation with the District Superintendent of Police, who makes a local inquiry as to the complaints of

BARODA STATE. MEMORANDUM.* * * * * * * Wild ganja. 22. Wild ganja is not to be found in this part of the country. It is neither cultivated nor does it grow spontaneously in any part of His Highness' dominions. Charas. 23. Charas is neither imported nor used by the people of this part of the country. Bawas and Atits who travel in Northern India sometimes bring charas with them, which is solely used by them. Ganja and bhang. 24. When I speak of ganja and bhang, I always mean flat ganja imported from Southern Maratha Country and bhang purchased in His Highnesse's ter- ritory or imported from Palanpur. Chura. 25. Chura is commonly known as garda in this part of the country. It is not imported in its original form, but assumes it in manipulation and in the process of packing. It is used in several preparations, of which I shall speak hereafter. The names by which the drug is locally known. 26. The hemp drug is generally known in this part of the country as ganja and bhang. The consumers of ganja and bhang have given them different names and they are known by those names in different social circles. Cultivation and growth of hemp. 32. In none of the districts of this State does the hemp plant grow spoutaneously. There is no cultivation, so to say, of the hemp plant in the State ex- cept in one place, viz., Bhadran of the Petlad taluka. It is generally from ten to twelve bighas annually. 33. The land adapted for bhang and ganja cultivation is what is called here goradu, a friable sandy loam. The first operations for cultivation are started in the month of March. The land is first ploughed generally three or four times and then freely manured with dung of cattle. When the rains set in and the land is perfectly saturated it is again ploughed and harrowed. The seeds are then sown from 4 to 5 seers per bigha. When the seedlings grow to the height of six inches they are rooted out and transplanted on the ridges made for the purpose There they are allowed to remain for three or four months. During the interval the weeding process is continued and when the plants commence budding the male plants are removed, that the female tree may not bear fruits or seeds. 34. When the flowers are well developed the plants are cut and spread on the ground where they are allowed to remain to be softened by the nocturnal dews. 35. Early in the morning the treading process is carried on till noon, continuing to do so till the flowers with young tops assume a flat shape. 36. This is the process adopted by the cultivators for manufacturing flat ganja, the older leaves and fruit vessels being bhang. The yield per bigha of ganja is 8 to 10 maunds and bhang 8 to 12 maunds. 37. The hemp plant can be grown in any part of His Highness's territory with advantage: the conditions of climate, soil, rainfall are favourably adapted to the growth of the plant. It is thus found in the compounds of sadhus, fakirs, and other people who consume ganja or bhang. 38. It is said that this plant was sown largely in various places. But the restriction placed by the British Government on exportation obliged the cultivator to give up cultivation. It is now cultivated in one village, Bhadran, where bhang is made for home consumption. No narcotic hemp is cultivated either for the production of charas or its flowers and seeds. The cultivators are an ordinary class of Kunbis. 39. The following is the extent of the cultivation of bhang and its annual yield for the last six years:BARODA STATE MEMORANDUM. 153 40. Two pounds of the home-bred bhang is herewith sent as a specimen for favour of be- ing forwarded to the Secretary, Indian Hemp Drugs Commission. Preparation and manufacture. 41. Bhang is the only product prepared in this State. Various other preparations are made from ganja, garda, and bhang. They were formerly made by the Tambolis and the Gandhis, but at present pre- pared by the license holder. 55. Before February 1892 there were no restrictions placed either on the importation or exportation of bhang and ganja, the importer had but to pay the customs duty. 56. The number of shops was not fixed nor was the sale or export regulated. Everybody on payment of import duty was free to deal in the drug as he pleased. Hence the quantity disposed of in home consumption and quantity exported cannot be ascertained. 57. Ganja and bhang were then sold in every shop of the Gandhi and Tamboli, except in places where the bhang and ganja were much used. In such places the right of selling these drugs was leased out to the highest bidder and large consumption was thus brought partly under control and excessive use restricted. 58. A large quantity of bhang and ganja was then exported from His Highness' territory by traders to the surrounding Native States and much profit was made by them. 59. The export trade has now become extinct since the publication of the Notification No. 10, dated 10th December 1891, which put a stop to importation or exportation by any person other than licensed vendor for each division. 60. Bhang and ganja which appeared in every shop of the Gandhi and Tamboli are now only sold in the shops licensed for the purpose. 61. The number of shops in each division is fixed and the sale of bhaug and ganja is regulated. 62. The following translation of the agreement will give a better idea of the restrictions placed upon the sale and manufacture of bhang and ganja by the Government farmer:154 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. 8. I shall not be entitled to claim the remaining stock of bhang, ganja, and the preparations thereof which shall remain at the expiration of the term of the farm or when it is annulled. Such balance shall be considered to be the property of Government, and the Subha of the district shall take it in his possession, and such portion of the bhang, ganja, and the preparations thereof thus taken in possession by the Subha, as is injurious to the health of the consumers shall be disposed of in accordance with the preceding clause 7, while the rest of the articles shall be made over to the new farmer at a price fixed by the Subha and the price thus adjusted shall be accepted by me. 9. I shall not sell bhang, ganja, and the preparations thereof at other shops or places than those already appointed. 10. I shall not sublet any shop or shops reserved for the sale of bhang, ganja, and the pre- parations thereof without permission of the Subha of the district. I shall not employ for the retail sale of bhang, ganja, and the preparations thereof any person, for whose employment I may not have previously received written sanction. I shall receive this sanction from the Subha of the district or from some other officer authorized by the Subha to grant such sanc- tion before employing any person for retail sale. 11. I shall not, without permission of the Subha of the district, sell more than a seer of 40 tolas of ganja or the preparations thereof, or more than 2 seers of 40 tolas each of bhang or the preparations thereof, to any person in one day. 12. I shall not receive any articles other than cash, or keep anything in pledge in barter for bhang, ganja, or the preparations thereof. I shall sell bhang, ganja, and the preparations thereof for the money that is current in each place. 13. I shall not open any shops for the sale of bhang, ganja, or the preparations thereof, or make sale therein after 9 P.M. and before sunrise; nor shall I harbour any person of bad repute in the shops. 14. I shall not permit persons of notoriously bad character to resort to my shops, nor shall I permit gambling or disorderly conduct, or indecent behaviour therein. I shall forthwith give information to the nearest Magistrate or Police officer of any suspected persons resorting to my shops. 15. I shall have always fixed up in a prominent place at the entrance of my shops a signboard bearing the following inscription in legible characters in the vernacular langu- age:BARODA STATE MEMORANDUM. 155 24. When the farm is thus annulled, all the bhang, ganja, and the preparations thereof remaining unsold shall be made over to the Subha, and shall be duly disposed of by him, and the vessels, packages, and conveyances which may have been seized shall be returned to me within two months after I shall have made good the whole loss. 25. If I fail to carry out the farm before its term expires according to the conditions of the agreement, I shall pay from my own property any sum that may be found to be due from me; and if this sum cannot be recovered from me, Government are at liberty to recover it from the amount deposited by me. 26. I shall deposit in the Government treasury a sum of 15 per cent. on the amount of the izara. 27. In case of any dispute which cannot be settled by a reference to these terms, I agree to any settlement that may be arrived at by a reference to the rules of auction sales in force." 63. The following statement will show the number of shops fixed and the number of shops opened by the farmers:156 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. "3. That except those who cultivate bhang or ganja in this State, and those persons or their agents who may have been licensed by the Subha to sell bhang, ganja, or the prepara- tions thereof, no person shall sell the aforesaid articles. "4. Cultivators of bhang and ganja in this State are permitted by the last preceding clause to sell bhang, ganja, or the preparations thereof. But these articles shall be sold only to those persons who shall have been licensed by the Subha to sell them, and to no other persons. "5. Any person desirous of having in his possession, or of transporting from one place to another in this State, a larger amount of bhang, ganja, or the preparations thereof than what is permitted by the preceding clause shall obtain a license from the Subha for so doing. "6. Any person cultivating bhang or ganja, who sells bhang, ganja, or the preparations thereof to persons other than the licensees, or any person who possesses without a license from the Subha more than a seer of ganja or the preparations thereof, or more than 4 seers of bhang or the preparations thereof, or who sells without a license from the Subha, bhang or ganja, or the preparations thereof, or transports them from one place to another in this State without a license from the Subha, shall on conviction before a Magistrate be liable to be punished with fine which may extend to Rs. 200 or with simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to three months; and the articles seized (that is bhang, ganja, or the preparations thereof) shall also be liable to confiscation.

"8. Any officer of the departments of Police, Revenue, Customs, Abkari, Opium, and Forest may detain and search, in any open place or on the public roads any person whom he has reason to believe to be guilty of an offence under the preceding clause 6. When the search is to be made by entering a building, it may be done by a police officer not inferior in rank to a Naib Fouzdar, or by an officer of Revenue, Customs, Abkari, Opium, and Forest de- partments, superior in rank to a Karkoon, or by any other person authorized by the Subha in this behalf. "9. Any offence committed under the preceding clause 6 by any person shall be inquir- ed into by any police officer not inferior in rank to a Naib Fouzdar, or any officer of the De- partments of Revenue, Customs, Abkari, Opium, and Forest, superior in rank to a Karkoon. "10. Any Magistrate convicting an offender under the terms of this notification may grant to any person who has contributed to the arrest and conviction of the offender a reward not exceeding one-fourth of the realized amount of the fine imposed, or the value of the articles confiscated in the case. "11. Nothing contained in this notification shall be deemed to affect the right of medical practitioners, chemists, or druggists or vendors of medical preparations, to prepare, sell, or supply bhang, ganja, or the preparations thereof for bona fide medical purposes. "12. This notification shall come into force on the 1st of February 1892." 169. Importation and sale of this drug is, I can say, a State monopoly since February 1892. 170. Previous to the introduction of the monopoly system, everybody was at liberty to import bhang and ganja on payment of customs duty, except at large places, which were leased out to the highest bidder. Exportation of bhang and ganja was not restricted, nor was home consumption regulated. Every street had its own shop and anybody could sell it with impunity. 171. With a view to introduce better reforms and to bring the sale of the drug under the Government control in order to restrict importation and sale, the State monopoly was in- troduced. 172. The chief control in regard to these drugs now rests with the divisional Subha assisted by the Abkari Superintendent, who has a number of Inspectors under him, to super- vise the licensed shops, and to prevent commission of offences connected with the illicit im- portation or sale of the drug. 173. The Sir Subha is the chief central authority who leases out the right of vending and examines annually the divisional administration carried on by the Subha. 174. The farm for sale of the drug is either given for a year or three years. The follow- ing are the figures for the four divisions:BARODA STATE MEMORANDUM. 157 175. Government farmer alone now imports the drug on payment of customs duty besides the amount shown above. 176. He sells the drug at the fixed number of shops by his agency, approved of by the Subha, and makes preparation from the drug at licensed places. 177. The imported drug is stored at depts appointed by the Subha, and the drug in transit by the farmer through His Highness's territory has to be covered by a permit signed by officer authorized in that behalf. 178. Neither shops nor depts can be increased without the permission of the Subha. Such permission is not granted until indispensable necessity is made out for opening a new shop or dept. 179. The number of retail shops is fixed by the Huzur. The guiding principle in fixing the number is the requirements of these drugs at places rather than area or population. Though there is no local option ascertained before opening shops, yet they are not forced upon the people. 180. The terms of the above notification will clearly show that there is a constant super- vision over the importation and sale, whether licit or illicit, by all the departments of the State, and there is a cordon of Nakas on the frontier which minimize the evils of illicit ingress or egress of these drugs. 181. With all these excellent arrangements of control, the object in view of checking the excessive use of these drugs is nullified by the clause in the said notification, rendering posses- sion of one seer of ganja or preparations thereof, or four seers of bhang or preparations there- of, lawful. The object was a laudable one, inasmuch as it was studiously inserted to soften the severity of the measure, having had bitter experience of hardship entailed by the Opium Rules. But the object was frustrated by the cheap sales of the drug in the surrounding Native States, flooding His Highness's territory with their narcotic articles and allowing opportunities for excessive indulgence. 182. The first modification that is necessary is to make the possession of ganja over ten tolas or preparation thereof, or half a seer of bhang or preparation thereof, unlawful. This modification will not much go to prevent illicit importation of the drug as long as surrounding Native States will continue to sell cheap ganja and bhang. 183. With all these hindrances in the way placed by the cheap sale of the drug in the surrounding Native States, the new measure has been productive of anxiously looked for results. The consumption of the drug has begun to fall off (side statement B*), giving figures of importation with the amount of revenue realized therefrom. The rise in the price has in- duced people to reduce their allowance, and though the number of consumers is, as it is said, not reduced, yet the quantity consumed is very much decreased. 184. The present measure is too young to give any decided opinion or suggest any modifi- cations. The object of all such modifications are more or less defeated by the want of co- operation of the surrounding Native States. 185. The system of taxation on these drugs can be summed up in a few words, viz.,customs duty plus the amount realized from the sale of sole right to vend. 186. This taxation has in certain places increased the price four-fold and in others six- fold than what was sold before the introduction of the new measure, and the consumption has fallen off wonderfully. All this may not be due to the new measure, and although excessive indulgence in the drug be still a constant factor, yet the past result gives a promise of a future happy angury. 187. It is said that a sudden rise in the price of liquor has driven people to consume ganja in certain places. How much truth there is in this allegation, cannot be determined, but grant- ing it to be true, the Government has no reason to deplore as the havocs committed by alcohol are more fearful than those of narcotics. I, therefore, suggest no modification in the mode of taxation or its incidence on any of the intoxicants. 188. There is only one shop in Baroda where bhang in liquid form is drunk on the pre- mises. There are no such shops anywhere else. I see no objection to the opening of such shops as exposure to public view, and the heavy price of the drug particularly charged at such places check excessive consumption much better than when done in solitude. 189. In conclusion, I beg most respectfully to state that I have done what I could do during the short time that was allotted to me. The magnitude of the task of collecting in- formation from those who are particularly sensitive when questioned about their mode of life and their habits, and the hot haste with which the work was to be gone through, will, I am sure, induce you to look with a great indulgence on any defects that may have crept in. The humble effort made by me in this connection, if only meet with your approval, will be the ample reward for the pains that I have taken during the last month and a half. *Not printed, 40
158 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. MEMORANDUM BY MR. R. H. GUNION ON HEMP DRUGS IN CENTRAL INDIA. 1. The definitions given in Dr. Prain's report are generally accepted in this Agency. In some parts of the west Malwa and Guna agencies bhang is also called vijayn, buti, and sabzi. In Bhopawar the name of bhang is given not only to the dry, but to the green leaves of the hemp plant (which appear to be sometimes eaten as a vegetable), and also to the decoction made by boiling the flowering-tops of the hemp plant in fresh butter or sweet almond-oil. In Indore the male plant is called hari and the female bhamgera. 2. There appears to be no spontaneous growth of the hemp plant in Central India. The plant is cultivated in the Indore State in the mahals that border on the Narbada for its fibre and for the production of ganja and bhang. None is cultivated for the production of charas. The fibre is got from a variety of the plant known locally as san. In the Indore State last year 193 bighas were under hemp cultivation. In Baghelkhand there is a limited cultivation of the plant for the production of ganja only. In the State of Dewas the hemp plant is cultivated for ganja (39 bighas) at one village and for bhang (9 bighas) at another. All over the Bhopawar Agency the plant is cultivated for bhang and ganja, rarely for charas; but the production is limited and, except in the parts adjoining British Nimar, only for the personal use of the cultivators. The plant is said to be extensively cultivated at Ujjain and Sipri, but unfortunately the Gwalior State has furnished no infor- mation. 3. In Indore and Dewas there is reported to be a slight decrease in the area under hemp cultivation. In Indore the decrease is said to be due to an increased consumption of liquor and in Dewas to the increased cultivation of hemp in Nimar. 4. As regards the method of cultivating the hemp plant, the Minister of Indore writes:CENTRAL INDIA MEMORANDUM. 159 B.160 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. Central India except a little in the Bhopawar Agency for the personal use of the cultivators, or for presents from them to religious mendicants. What charas is consumed in other parts of Central India is mostly imported from the Punjab. In the State of Indore about 900 maunds of ganja and bhang together are yearly manufactured. In Dewas territory the yearly output is 156 maunds of ganja and 64 maunds of bhang. 8. The Political Agent in Bhopawar thus describes the process of making ganja, bhang, majum, and charas:CENTRAL INDIA MEMORANDUM. 161 12. Inveterate smokers of charas appear to be found only among the religious mendi- cants, fakirs, gosains, sadhus, and viragis. Most cultivators in Bhopawar smoke ganja occasionally; but nowhere else in Central India are the cultivators said to be ganja-smokers. The Indore Minister particularly says that the agricultural classes rarely use ganja. In the Baghelkhand, Bhopal, West Malwa, and Guna Agencies, the ganja-smokers (other than fakirs, etc.) are said to be chamars, mehters, and other low caste people. Some witnesses give figures. In Dewas about 1 per cent. of the population are said to be ganja-smokers. In Rutlam (population 89,160) there are said to be 500 ganja-smokers and 50 charas-smokers. In Indore it is supposed that 2 per cent. of the male population smoke ganja and that barely one in a thousand smokes charas. The smoking of both is generally more common in towns than in villages. In Charkhari (Bundelkhand) all sadhus, etc., 30 per cent. of the low caste people, and 5 per cent. of the rest of the population are said to smoke ganja. 13. The flat ("chapta") variety is the only ganja generally used in Central India. In Indore it is called hari. The Superintendent of the Sehore Bazaar says that chur is cheaper and that poor people sometimes use it for bhang. 14. The little charas that is used in Malwa comes mostly from the Punjab or the North- West Provinces, being imported by Vilayatis or Afghans. What is used in Rewah comes mostly from Patna. It is only in Bhopawar that there is any manufacture of charas, and there, as has been already said, it is prepared for personal use only. 15. In no part of Central India is bhang said to be used for smoking. Bhang is to some extent eaten and largely drunk all over the Agency. Some figures are given. In Indore 5 per cent. of the population are said to be drinkers and one in 5,000 eaters, of bhang. In Rutlam (population 89,160) 1,500 people are said to drink and 500 to eat bhang. The drinking of bhang is supposed to be common among all the higher castes of Hindus162 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. small teacups full of water taken in three doses during the day is an efficient remedy in cases of painful gonorrha. Bhang tel, commonly called bhang, is a decoction of bhang in fresh butter or sweet almond-oil. It is a powerful narcotic. The Indore use of ganja and bhang is thus described by the MinisterCENTRAL INDIA MEMORANDUM. 163 who use ganja and bhang. But it is only the smoking of ganja that is distinctly regarded as disreputable. The social drinking of bhang, referred to in the last paragraph, is of course not regarded as in any way reprehensible. 24. It is generally agreed that for an habitual smoker to forego the use of ganja would be a serious privation. The habitual users of hemp drugs, and particularly ganja, are mostly ignorant and fanatical men. Among religious mendicants the habit of smoking ganja is hereditary and inveterate. Nothing can take the place of ganja to these men, and the deprivation of the drug that their order has used for so many centuries would, there is every reason to suppose, be a serious political danger. The matter of bhang is not so serious, its users belonging, as a rule, to a better class; but in this connexion it has been pointed out by more than one witness that both opium and drink are dearer than bhang; that Kshattriyas are the only twice-born Hindus to whom strong drink is not prohibited; and so that Brahmans, for instance, if they wanted an intoxicant, would take to opium; while Sudra users of hemp drugs, to whom strong drink is not forbidden, would not be able to afford it. On this point the Political Agent in Bhopawar writes:164 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. INDORE STATE MEMORANDUM. Control on the growth of hemp. The cultivation of the hemp plant for the purpose of producing bhang, ganja and charas is so extremely limited in this State that there is no scope whatever for putting it under administrative control. The whole area under narcotic hemp plant cultivation is given in the appendix.* The figures given there show that the maximum area during the last twenty years was 354 bighas, minimum 66 bighas, and the average 181 bighas. The cultivation is confined to a few mahals in the Nimar district, bordering on the Narbada, and in Sanwer a few miles to the north of Indore. Thus it will be seen that although the State puts no restriction on the cultivation, or controls it in any way whatever, the ryot has not found it to his advantage to grow it largely, although the plant is capable of thriving almost everywhere in the State. There is no special rate of assessment charged on land under hemp cultivation; but is determined solely by the quality of the soil, and is usually Rs. 7 to Rs. 8 a bigha. No wild hemp is found in the State. Here or there a plant may be seen by road or river side or near the huts of fakirs, etc., due to the dropping of the hemp seed by consumers. Manufacture. The growth being thus limited the manufacture of ganja and bhang is necessarily so. Importation and exportation. Under the excise system prevalent in Indore, the import and export of the hemp drugs are not shown under a separate head denoting the hemp drugs, but are included under the general head of ' kirana ' (i. e., drugs, spices, etc.), and cannot therefore be accurately given. There is no doubt that the drugs are both imported into the State and exported from it, but not to that extent which would make it desirable to assign special heads in the State accounts to their traffic. As in the case of cultivation, so here there are no restrictions on either the importation or exportation of any of the hemp drugs. They can be imported or exported by any body to any extent without a license on the payment merely of the fixed duty. Practically the trade is so limited as not to require its regulation by the State. The importers of ganja and other drugs are generally the banias and there is no limit fixed to the storing and transport of these drugs, by them. Sale. The sale is either (1) wholesale or (2) retail. No license is required for wholesale, and there is no maximum limit to the quantity a wholesale dealer may sell at a time. There is, however, a minimum limit, namely, 60 seers, prescribed by a regulation of the State below which the wholesale dealer may not sell on pain of liability to confiscation of his commodity and a fine up to Rs. 50 by the customs officer and to unlimited amount by the Darbar. The occasions on which the darbar have exercised its powers in this respect are very rare indeed, and have done so extremely moderately. The State prescribes no minimum or maximum price of sale, and the wholesale dealer may dispose of his ware at any price it may fetch. The right to sell in retail is farmed out by public auction, and none but the leaseholder or his agents can make retail sales. The ijardar or leaseholder is at liberty to open any num- ber of shops at any place which may be convenient to him, In practice, however, it is understood that he follows the advice of the customs officers of the State. As a matter of fact at present the retail farmer has only one shop of his own in the city of Indore, and has com- missioned fifteen tobacco-sellers, to whom he sells a quantity not exceeding half a seer at an in- terval of two or three days, to sell for him. In the mofussil the contractor usually has one shop at the head-quarters of every mahal, making about forty shops in all in the districts. Although it cannot be said that the number of shops is determined deliberately with a view to area and population, it naturally adjusts itself to the demand, and therefore indirectly to area and population. There is no such thing in the State as "local option" firstly, because the matter is so small as not to require any such measure being adopted by the State; and, secondly, because the people themselves have never asked and have no need for it. The thing does not amount to an evil giving rise to complaints requiring a remedy. The average amount of the retail contract for the last eleven years is Rs. 5,140 per year. The law prescribes no limit, maximum or minimum, in point of quantity to the retail sales to, or possession by, a consumer. But it has fixed the rates of the retail sale of each of these drugs, which are as follows: ganja, at half a seer a rupee in Indore city and one seer a * Not printed.
INDORE STATE MEMORANDUM. 165 rupee in the mofussil, bhang at four seers a rupee throughout the State, and charas at five tolas a rupee throughout. The probable yearly consumption of these drugs in the State may be about 200 maunds of ganja and an equal quantity of bhang, leaving charas quite out of account as being inappre- ciable. These figures are the result of a very rough calculation, and not based upon reliable sta- tistics. Having regard, however, to the probable number of consumers and the quantity con- sumed by an average consumer, they appear to be approximately correct. Duties. Besides the amount realised from the ijara or monopoly of retail sale, which is Rs. 5,140 yearly on an average as stated before, there are two duties levied on these drugs known as "katati" or inward, and "bharati" or "nikasu" or outward. These terms include the import and the export duty pro- per, that is, the duty levied on goods brought into the State from, or sent out of the State to, foreign territory as well as the duty levied on goods transmitted from one mahal to another within the State itself at each mahal. The " katati" and " bharati" are levied at the same rate at the place itself. But the rate varies in different districts, being maximum Rs. 3-12-0 per rs of 3 maunds or 120 seers and minimum annas 12 for ganja; maximum annas 15 for one rs and minimum annas 8 for bhang; and maximum Rs. 7-11-0 and minimum Rs. 5-8 per rs for charas. The duties are levied at the Sayar nakas by which every merchandize must pass. Evasion to pay the duty is punishable with confiscation of the goods smuggled and a fine up to Rs. 50 by the customs officer, or to an unlimited amount by the Darbar. The temptation to smug- gle is greatly checked by the smallness of the duty and by the comparatively heavy liability to punishment. An enormously excessive tax like that of Rs. 335 per maund levied in Ben- gal (see page 324, volume V of Dr. Watt's Dictionary) would, in the very nature of things, invite smuggling, whereas the small rates levied by Indore cannot be expected to operate in that direction. There is still a reason to believe that these drugs are smuggled into the State from Ujjain; and from Sanowad they are possibly smuggled into the adjoining British territory or other Native States. Excepting at these two points, smuggling is seldom heard of. Administration. The central administrative power rests with the Darbar. The executive head of customs and excise for the Indore city and Indore zillah is the Muntazim Sayar and for the other zillahs the Subha of each zillah. The present excise system in respect to hemp drugs in the State, so far as it may be so called, is based upon a few standing circular orders promulgated by the Darbar in the State Gazette from time to time. Some of these have already been noticed in their proper places in this memorandum. The system is on the whole working fairly relatively to the im- portance of the interests involved and no modification of it is contemplated. 42
166 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. JEYPORE STATE MEMORANDUM. (1) The hemp plant is grown here only for use as bhang. Its cultivation is not in any way controlled by the Raj. (2) Ganja and charas are not manufactured here from the products of the hemp (bhang) plants. Both these drugs are imported from Hoshiarpur and the Punjab. Bhang of a quality superior to what is locally produced is also imported here to some extent. The sale of bhang, charas, and ganja is not in any way controlled by the Raj. Anybody can, at any place, open shops for the sale of these drugs. (3) Customs duty only is levied by the Raj on bhang, charas, and ganja. The customs duty on the export and import of bhang as well as on its import into the capital city from the districts is Re. 1 per maund. The "mapa" or inland customs duty on bhang is 4 annas per maund. The customs duty on the import of charas is at Rs. 20 per maund and on that of ganja is at the rate of Rs. 4 per maund. (a) No particular system is in existence here regarding the growth of the hemp plant or the sale of its products. (b) Wild hemp is not found in abundance anywhere in the Jeypore territory. The hemp plant, whether wild or cultivated, is only used as bhang and not made to yield either charas or ganja. About 10,000 maunds of bhang is produced in the Jeypore territory. No attempt is made here to control the possession or sale of this drug. (c) The hemp plant is not at all cultivated here for the production of ganja or charas, but only for use as bhang. The cultivation of bhang plants in this part of the country is neither prohibited nor restricted to any particular locality. (d) Charas is imported here by the Afghans and the Kabulis and ganja and bhang by native traders. All imports into and exports from the British territory of bhang, charas, and ganja are covered under Government license, and when exported from other Native States, under the customs pass (rawana) of that State. All goods allowed to pass into the territory after being examined by the customs chaukies, which are located at places where traffic is generally carried on. Bhang is exported from here to other neighbouring Native States, but before allowing it to pass in any quantity, the Customs Department requires the intending exporter to give security that the drug will not be smuggled into any other place. (e) The wholesale and retail vendors of bhang, charas, and ganja are not under any control, nor are they required to obtain license from the Raj. (f) Besides the customs duty as mentioned in paragraph No. 3, no other tax is levied by the Raj on bhang, charas, or ganja. (g) The number and sites of the retail shops of any of these drugs are neither fixed here by the Raj nor put to auction sale. The vendors are quite free to open shops anywhere they like in the territory. (h) The Raj does not fix any rate at which the drug must be supplied by wholesale to retail vendors. The average retail price (to consumers) of bhang is Rs. 13 per maund, of ganja Rs. 25 per maund, and of charas of the first quality Rs. 160 per maund and of the second quality Rs. 100 per maund. These prices of the drugs do not differ much in different districts. (i) Neither any maximum amount is fixed for retail sales to, or possession by, the ordinary consumer, nor any minimum price is fixed for the drugs. (j) There is no reason to believe that smuggling of bhang, charas or ganja from other provinces or other Native States prevails here to any extent; and to pre- vent smuggling of all articles on which customs duty is due to the Raj, it is provided in the rules of the Customs Department that the smuggler, when detected, forfeits the goods smuggled.
JEYPORE STATE MEMORANDUM. 167 The cultivation, possession, or sale of these drugs, however, is not in any way restrictedby the Raj. (k)No excise system in respect to hemp drugs exists in the Jeypore territory. (l) It has been already stated that the hemp plant is grown here only for use as bhang; and as it is not cultivated here as a separate crop, but grown along with other crops, the extent of its cultivation cannot therefore be ascertained. About 27 maunds of bhang is exported from the Jeypore territory and about 50 maunds of bhang is carried from one district to another within the Jeypore territory, and about 300 maunds are imported into the city from the districts and about 64 maunds are imported from abroad. Thus about 364 maunds of bhang is consumed in the city. The amount of con- sumption in the districts and the holdings of jagirdars and others cannot be ascertained. About 54 maunds of ganja and about 129 maunds of charas are imported into this place; but as no further duty is levied on any of these drugs, if they are taken from one district to another, it cannot be said how much of the quantity imported is consumed in the city and how much of it is taken into the districts. Besides the Customs duty, no land revenue is derived by the Raj from the cultivation of the hemp (bhang) plant. (m) There are no other points to be added to make the system complete and intelligible.
168 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. JODHPUR STATE MEMORANDUM. The hemp plant does neither spontaneously nor to any great extent grow in Marwar, but in a few villages of the parganas of Jodhpur, Bali, Pali, Bilara, Merta, Sojat, Jaitaram, and Jaswantpura, where both the kharif and rabi crops are produced, the cultivators sow some seeds of bhang round the fields of onion, coriander, mustard, and "rijka" grass as well as round the dhurras (passages) of water in the winter season. The growth of the plant is not controlled, but when it grows up, the leaves are cut down and dried in the summer season. Some of the seeds, which fall down on the ground at the harvest time, sprout up in the rainy season; in the beginning of winter they are also dried. If there happens to be any ganja seed among those of the bhang it also germinates. When it is cut down it is kept separate, and the produce thus obtained is termed "makuria ganja," which is chiefly used by Samis and Jogis only, as it is of much inferior quality, and for the same reason it is not offered for sale. The cultivation of the plant is neither permitted nor prohibited; the cultivators cultivate as they have been doing since long; but there are no separate fields of bhang or ganja, and they do not grow abundantly, and consequently there is neither any system of administration with regard to these drugs nor any system of restriction and control. Charas is not at all prepared in this country. As the local produce of bhang is hardly sufficient to meet the wants of the consumers this drug, as well as ganja and charas, are imported from other countries. For the importation of ganja and charas a license is obtained from the Residency office, but a parwana from the Darbar is sufficient to import bhang. The Darbar levies custom duties on the import, export, and transit of these drugs, and they are as given below:JODHPUR STATE MEMORANDUM. 169 of Marwar, probably on account of there being a greater population, a contract for the sale of bhang, ganja, and charas has since 1880 been given, which has brought an income of Rs. 14,047 to the Darbar. A parwana instead of a license is issued by the city Kotwal in Jodhpur and by the Hakim in Pali by auction to the highest bidder. It covers a period of nearly one year. Both the aforesaid authorities supervise and control the sale and punish the infringers of the contract. In places other than Jodhpur and Pali, where there is a less demand and supply of these drugs, their possession and sale are not controlled, and no necessity has ever been felt for such control. There are no retail vendors in Pali, but there are fourteen in Jodhpur, all of whom are under the control of the contractor, who himself has two shops within the town. The retail sellers are ordinary shopkeepers vending these drugs along with other articles. With reference to area and population, when and where they see any necessity for the same, they sell these drugs purchasing at a lump sum from the contractor. The rates at which the drug is supplied by the contractor to the retail vendors and ordi- nary consumers are the following:172 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. (i) According to section 23 of the excise law the maximum amount fixed for retail sales to, or possession by, an ordinary consumer is bhang 120 tolas and charas 40 tolas, and the fixing of the minimum prices rests with the nazims. (j) Since the introduction of the excise rules this year, no case of smuggling has come to notice. At the time when the excise rules came into force, all the drugs were taken away from those who possessed them and were either confiscated or sold to wholesale vendors. As mentioned in (f) defaulters of customs duty are punished by fine and confiscation of the drug. Illicit sales and possession are punished according to section 34. (k) None. (l) As no records of past years exist, no explanation can be given of any dif- ferences and variations that have taken place in the cultivation, trade, etc., of the drugs. There was neither permission nor prohibition on the part of the raj, and everyone who chose used publicly to sell and buy. The customs duty only was taken in the raj. The present rules have come into force this year only and have not been fully carried out yet, and contracts have not yet been given everywhere, but illicit sales have been stopped. The statement cannot therefore be filled in. Statistics regarding the consumption and revenue cannot be prepared at present. The quantity imported can be ascertained from the Customs Department. Men- tion of cultivation has been made in (b), and regarding the importation of the drugs information is supplied in 2. (m) Full details are contained in the excise law. Translated. CHAS. S. BAYLEY, Political Agent, Bikanir. Translation of a communication from the head of the Customs Department, Bikanir, dated 27th October 1893. The Council's Order, dated the 17th October 1893, enclosing papers regarding the hemp drugs was received on the 21st idem. With reference to paragraphs 3 and 4 of the letter from the Secretary to the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission and the note mentioned in para- graph 3,I beg to state that the bhang, charas, and ganja plants do not grow either wild or by cultivation in this State, but the drugs are imported from foreign territory. No other prepa- rations from bhang, ganja, or charas are made in this State for trading purposes, nor are they imported from other territory. On the Holi and other festivals majum is prepared from bhang and is sometimes sold retail. Bhang is pounded, mixed with milk and sugar and drunk. It is also eaten dry, in which case almonds, pistachios, etc., etc., are mixed with it. The charas imported into the State is of two kinds, viz., (1) garwa, which is smoked with tobacco; its effect is immediate and strong; and (2) charas. This latter is also smoked in the same way, but its effect is less strong. The ganja is of one kind only. Prior to Sambat 1942 customs duty was levied at different rates on bhang, charas, and ganja. The system of levying the duty was also different at head-quarters and in the districts, i.e., in the districts duty was realized by the tahsils, and at head-quarters by the Customs Department. The statistics for the past twenty years cannot be supplied in the prescribed form because no records exist from which the different rates of duty prevalent in different places, the amount of revenue, the quantity of the drugs imported, etc., could be ascertained. The Customs Department was reorganized in Sambat 1942, since which time bhang has been taxed at Rs. 5 per maundand ganja and charas at Rs. 20 per maund, and one system of realization of duty has been introduced for the whole State. The customs officials are under the control of the head of the depart- ment. The customs rules have been in force. Girdawars and Naib Girdawars have been appoint- ed for inspection work. The rawanas of Sambat 1942 have been destroyed, but those from Sambat 1943 to 1949 are in existence, from which a statement showing the quantity of the drugs imported and the amount of revenue realized during the eight years has been prepared. It is submitted with this report. For Sambat 1942 the quantity imported has been shown in a lump. The tax on charas and ganja is levied at one rate; therefore in. some rawanas the words "charas and ganja" have been used together, and hence information regarding the two drugs cannot be supplied separately. There was formerly no prohibition in this State, and no licenses for wholesale or retail vend were given; therefore the drugs were imported and sold without restriction. According to article 5 of the Agreement with the British Govern- ment the export from this State into British territory of intoxicating drugs was prohibited. Exporters were punished with confiscation of the drugs and fine and imprisonment according to rules framed in 1878. The punishment for the export of opium was different. But since- the beginning of 1893 the excise law of the Darbar has been put in force under the super- vision of the nazims and tahsildars, and the whole arrangement has been put under the control of the Revenue Department, from which information regarding the granting of licenses for wholesale and retail vend, the import and export of the drugs, and the opening of the shops, etc., can be obtained. The answers to the Secretary's questions can also be obtained

174 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. ALWAR STATE MEMORANDUM. There is no special arrangement in force in regard to the control of the growth of the hemp plant in this State. Ganja and charas are not produced here. The zemindars in some of the villages grow bhang either close to their wells or on the borders of their fields on a very limited scale. Here and there may be found wild plants of bhang, but it does not grow to any appreciable extent. The system obtaining in this State for the management of the excise administration of the hemp drugs is that the State grants the monopoly of the import and sale of drugs, including poppy and opium, to a contractor for a fixed period under certain stated terms. In September last the contract for drugs, including poppy and opium, was given for three years for Rs. 10,550. This sum has been ascertained from enquiry to include Rs. 9,000 on account of poppy and opium and the balance, Rs. 1,550, represents the income on account of excise duty on bhang, ganja, and charas. In addition to the excise duty, bhang is liable to pay octroi duty at ten annas per maund, while ganja and charas are exempt from octroi tax- ation. Ganja, it will be observed, is neither produced nor imported here. Charas is imported for consumption into the State to the extent of 61/2 maunds annually, while the production of bhang in the State is almost sufficient for the requirements of the people. If at any time any small quantity is required over and above the local produce, it is obtained from elsewhere by the contractor under restrictions imposed on it in British territory or other Native States from which it is imported. 2. With these preliminary remarks, we proceed to discuss seriatim the points alluded to in the note which accompanied the letter from the Secretary to the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission on the subject:ALWAR STATE MEMORANDUM. 175 (i) There is no maximum amount fixed for retail sales to, or possession by the ordinary consumer, who can buy and possess drugs sufficient for one month's consump- tion from a licensed vendor. He cannot, however, import them, nor can he buy them from any other but the licensed vendor. There is no minimum price fixed for the drugs. (j) No estimate can be made of the extent smuggling from other provinces or other Native States prevails here. It is the business of the contractor to check smuggling, and when any cases are reported, the smugglers are arrested and, if found guilty, are punished and the illicit drug is confiscated. Bhang cul- tivated or grown in fields is either sold to the contractor, or the proprietor obtains a license from the former for its sale. (k) No modifications of the present excise system in respect to hemp drugs are under consideration. (l) The appended statement * will show as far as possible the extent of cultivation and trade, the sources of retail supply, the amount of consumption and the revenue of this State in respect to the hemp drugs.

178 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. KOTAH STATE MEMORANDUM. Letter No. 3772, dated 25th September 1893, of the Agent to the Governor-General in Rajputana, together with its enclosure, reached me. In reply to paragraph 2 it is stated that very little ganja and bhang are cultivated in this State and their consumption is very little, hence it would not be necessary to send anybody from here to appear before the Commission as witness. The questions of the Commission are answered as below:JHALLAWAR STATE MEMORANDUM. 179 JHALLAWAR STATE MEMORANDUM. (1) There is no control over the growth of the hemp plant, or (2) over the manufacture, importation and sale of any of its products. (3) There is an import duty of 8 annas per maund of 35 seers on all sorts of ganja and bhang and of one anna per ditto on charas. There are also local dues of 2 annas per maund on bhang and ganja, while 1 per cent is levied on all sales of either drug, weighment dues also being levied when they are sold by weight. There is no system in this State whatever for the control of hemp drugs. Wild hemp is found in very small quantities; a few stalks here and there probably spring from cultivated seed accidentally deposited. Anybody can import any hemp drug, except into the cantonment, where there is a licensed farmer; once the latter has paid for his license he is free from all con- trol. The extent of cultivation is about 30 acres and the produce about 165 maunds of ganja and 30 of bhang. The trade returns of the last four years do not distinguish between ganja and bhang; they show an average import of 105 maunds of both drugs and an average export of 120 maunds, while 10 maunds 25 seers paid local internal dues. The average receipts have been Rs. 65-8-6 per annum. JHALRAPATAN; G. R. IRWIN, The 2nd January 1894. Political Agent.
180 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. TONK STATE MEMORANDUM. The hemp plant is not grown anywhere in the State, hence no supervision exists as to its cultivation. Bhang is manufactured by drying the leaves of the hemp plant. It is imported together with ganja and charas by foreign traders and sold by them to the shopkeepers of the State by whom the drugs are disposed of in small quantities. The duties imposed on the drugs are as follows:TONK STATE MEMORANDUM. 181 The extent of cultivation is already given in replies to questions (1) and (c).

The extent of trade represents the average annual consumption. In Pirawa and Nimbahera the drugs are not taxed, hence the extent of trade in them has not been given. A. P. THORNTON, Lieut.-Col., Political Agent.
182 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. BUNDI STATE MEMORANDUM. No control of any kind is exercised on the growth of the plant. Hemp drugs are not manufactured in the State. They are imported for sale from for- eign States both by wholesale dealers and petty shopkeepers. Land rent is not separately levied and custom duty is charged at 8 annas a maund. There are two kinds of ganja known as "Indori" and "Shahbadi." Besides these the State knows nothing of any other kind. There is one uniform system throughout the State. No officer is appointed for its administration, nor is it in any way supervised or based on any Act or rules. Wild hemp is not found in the State. The drug is imported for sale both by foreign and home traders. The quantity grown in the State is disposed of by traders of the State. Cultivators grow the hemp plant on land irrigated by wells as other crops. No prohibi- tion or restriction exists as to its cultivation, nor is any sort of control exercised. Ganja and other drugs are imported for sale by traders of foreign States and by maha- jans, " pansaris," and " tambolis" of the State. The system of issuing license is not in force, nor is there any arrangement for controlling the transport of the drugs. The wholesale and retail vendors are not under any control. They are at liberty to dis- pose of the drugs in any way they like. Import and transit duties on ganja, bhang, and charas when brought into the State or passing through it are charged at the uniform rate of 8 annas per maund. Persons found evading the raj duty are charged double the amount, viz., Re. 1 per maund. Regular or special shops for the sale of the drugs do not exist anywhere in the State, nor are the latter given on contract. Traders and shopkeepers are at liberty to sell the same any- where they choose without let or hindrance. No rate is fixed at which the drug must be supplied by wholesale to retail vendors. The average price per maund is given below, and varies according to the state of the market:- Wholesale per maund Retail per maund. Rs. A. P. Rs. A. P. Ganja 25 0 0 32 0 0 Bhang 10 0 0 15 0 0 Charas 200 0 0 240 0 0 No limit is fixed as to the amount, whether maximum or minimum, which should be sold to, or be in the possession of ordinary consumers. The minimum price of the drugs is given in the preceding answer. There being no prohibition for the importation of the drugs smuggling is not resorted to. Similarly, there being no prevention for their growth, illicit cultivation is not carried on. Proposals for modifying the present excise system are under consideration. Bhang only is cultivated on a few pieces of land watered by wells, but the outturn cannot be estimated. The extent of trade for the past eleven years is as follows:BUNDI STATE MEMORANDUM. 183 The above are imported from Indore and Ujjain and are sold together with the quantity locally produced. The average revenue of the past 11 years is as follows:184 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. SHAHPURA STATE MEMORANDUM. Bhang is the only drug produced in the Phulia pargana of Shahpura. Ganja is not grown, neither is charas manufactured. There is no control on bhang of any kind on the part of the Chiefship, except that the land used for its cultivation is charged rent at the usual rate. Bhang is manufactured by drying the leaves of the plant, and both ganja and bhang are imported from Bhilwara by the shop keepers of Shahpura and sold both in Shahpura terri- tory and to traders and others of foreign States. For the cultivation of bhang along with the "ranjka" grass land rent is charged at Rs. 6 per bigah, or Rs. 10-6 per acre. Import and export duties on both bhang and ganja are levied at the same rate, viz., one pice per seer. The ganja imported into the Chiefship is of the kind known as "Indori." There is no system whatever for the sale, etc., of bhang, nor is it controlled by any officer or Acts or rules of any kind. The drug is imported and sold by the shopkeepers at their will and pleasure. Wild hemp is not found in the Chiefship. No prohibition exists for the cultivation of the hemp plant, but, as already stated, ganja is not grown anywhere in the Chiefship. Bhang is invariably cultivated with the "ranjka" grass in localities with plenty of moisture. Ganja and other hemp drugs are imported by mahajans, "tambolis," and by a few "halvais." The system of granting license is not in force, nor is there any arrangement for controlling the transport of the drugs. They are not under any control, nor are they licensed. Shahpura is a fortified town with gates, at each of which customs officials are posted, who register all goods imported into or exported from the town and levy duties thereon. In villages "mapadars" are appointed for the collection of duties on all goods, including drugs, etc. On all bhang taken from Shahpura territory to foreign States transit duty is charged at three pies per seer in addition to the export duty. "Mapa"and weighment duties are not levied on ganja as it is not produced in the Chiefship, but import, export, and transit duties are charged at 3 pies per seer. There being no prohibition for the sale of ganja and bhang, it is not necessary to fix sites of retail shops or grant licenses for the sale of drugs. No rate is fixed at which the drug must be sold by wholesale to retail vendors. The average wholesale price of ganja, which is imported from Bhilwara, is Rs. 9 per maund and of bhang Rs. 5 per maund, and the retail price Rs. 25 and Rs. 8 per maund respectively. No maximum amount is fixed for retail sales to, or possession by the ordinary con- sumers, whilst the minimum prices fixed for the sale of the drugs are given in the preceding answer. The duties on the drugs being light, and there being no prohibition for their importation or growth, smuggling and illicit cultivation are not carried on. For the future it is proposed to issue licenses to a limited number of persons at few selected places. Bhang is not separately grown anywhere in the Phulia pargana of Shahpura. It is cultivated with the "ranjka" grass. The area under bhang cultivation, if separately calculat- ed is estimated at 25 bighas, yielding 125 maunds, at 5 maunds per bigah. In addition to this 25 maunds are imported from Bhilwara, making a total of 150 maunds. Of this, about 125 maunds are consumed annually and the rest exported to territories of foreign states. About 4 maunds of ganja are imported annually and consumed in the Chiefship. A state- ment showing the revenue derived from the hemp drugs for the past twenty years cannot be- submitted owing to the customs duties of the Chiefship having been farmed for a considerable number of years to various persons, who kept no regular account of the income realized by them. The average annual income derived from import, export, and transit duties on the hemp- plants is, however, roughly estimated at Rs. 200. Translated. A. P. THORNTON, Lieut.-Colonel, Political Agent.
DHOLPUR STATE MEMORANDUM. 185 DHOLPUR STATE MEMORANDUM. 1. The hemp plant, i.e., ganja, charas, and bhang, are not produced in this State. They are under the control of the Customs Department. 2. Hemp drugs are not manufactured here. Bhang is generally imported from the British districts and the Bhurtpur State, ganja from the Gwalior State, and charas from Patiala. 8. The duties levied upon bhang and ganja are Rs. 4-4-0 per maund and on charas Re. 1-1-0 per seer. The rates of duty imposed on these drugs in the Sir Muthra Estate are given in the statement* attached. (a) Uniformity of system prevails throughout the State. There is only one contractor for these intoxicating drugs in the State, while in the parganas he has his sub-contractors. This contract is in the charge of the customs officer. (b) Wild hemp, i.e., ganja, charas, and bhang, is not found in the State, nor is any drug manufactured from it. (c) The cultivation of intoxicating drugs is prohibited throughout the State without per- mission of the Darbar. There is no particular locality in which cultivation is restricted. It is generally the custom throughout the whole territory to obtain permission before they are cultivated. The cultivation is under the control of the customs officer. Persons cultivating without permission are punished. (d) The contractors import these drugs by rail and road from the British districts and Gwalior and Patiala States under passes granted by the Political Agent and the Collectors concerned. (e) In this State contract is given for the sale of intoxicating drugs for a certain period. It is under control of the Customs Department. (f) Ganja, charas, and bhang are not produced in the State, and hence the rates of land revenue cannot be given. The rates of duty levied on these drugs, when imported into the State by a trader or contractor, are given in answer (3). The sellers of these drugs, if found to have evaded payment of the duties, are punished. (g) There is only one contractor for the State. He has his own sub-contractors in the parganas. The number of shops is not determined with reference to area and population. There are in all twelve shops in the parganas besides the general contractor. The retail sale ven- dors do not purchase these drugs from the wholesale vendors, but import them from outside, i.e.,bhang from British districts, ganja from Gwalior territory, and charas from Agra and Patiala. These drugs are sold at one price throughout the State, viz.:186 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. SIROHI Statistics relating to hemp drugs for Year.

[APP. KARAULI STATE MEMORANDUM. Ganja and charas are not produced in the State. Bhang grows spontaneously. Malis generally cultivate it on grounds near the boundary walls of their fields. When leaves come out, they are collected and dried and are then brought into use. Sometimes they are sold also. There is no special control from the side of the State. Ganja and charas are not produced here. Ganja is generally imported from the Gwalior territory and charas from the town of Bhurtpur. Bhang grows spontaneously, sometimes cultivated by the malis and sometimes imported from the territory of Jeypur. The duties levied upon ganja are Rs. 2-8-0 per maund and on charas Rs. 10 per maund, and on bhang Re. 1 per maund. Uniformity of system prevails throughout the State. There is one officer at the head of the Department of Customs who resides at the capital. The levying of duties and other mat- ters connected with the Department of Customs are in charge of this officer, and according to the customs tariff drawn up in 1882, the duties on different articles are levied by the Depart- ment of Customs. Hemp is neither cultivated here nor grows in a wild state. Hemp plant for the production of ganja or charas is neither cultivated nor grows sponta- neously. No restriction is put upon bhang, the production of which is very limited. It is not particularly known who imports these drugs. Bhang is generally imported by the malis and cultivators for sale. An annual fair, called the Sivaratri fair, is held here in the month of February. In this fair local and foreign traders generally bring these drugs for sale. During this fair no customs duties are levied, nor any license issued for their importation. Certainly after the fair is over, duties are levied upon these drugs. Hence there is no necessity for the State to supervise the storing or transport of these drugs. Of course, strict supervision should be maintained for the levying of duties. As for the sale of these drugs, contract is given to the vendors in three places, viz., Kerowli town, Mandrel and Machilpur. The contractors have the right to sell these drugs in retail. Excepting the contractors others are not allowed to sell it in retail. Everybody has the right to sell these drugs to the contractors. There is no restriction on this. But if these drugs are imported either by the contractors or somebody else, they are not exempted from paying duties. The vendors of these drugs are not under control here. But they are licensed vendors. These licenses are given to them after they had paid fees for the licenses. No rent is collected if any of these drugs are cultivated. Customs duties are surely taken. The following is the scale of duties levied upon these drugs if they are exported or imported:- Rs. A. P. Ganja 2 8 0 per maund. Charas 10 0 0 " Bhang 1 0 0 " The officers of the Customs Department supervise over the collection of customs duties. Smugglers, etc., are punished according to the customs regulations. The sites of retail shops are not fixed by the State. The contract for the sale of these drugs is given by auction. The contractor opens his own shop for the sale of these drugs. The number of shops is not fixed with reference to area, or population, and the setting up of a new shop depends upon the sale of these drugs. In the town of Kerowli the total number of shops is six, and there is one at Maudrel and one at Machilpur. The sales of these drugs are given on contract. The contractors are called both whole- sale and retail vendors. No rate is fixed for retail vendors from the state, so no average price could be recorded, nor could the contractors of this place say this, for no record is kept of these things. No modification regarding the existing excise system is under consideration. Ganja and charas are not produced here. Bhang grows spontaneously to some extent. Mali cultivates it to some extent. Hence no trade is here regularly carried on, since the pro- duction is very limited. On the other hand, these are imported from the neighbouring States. No rent is collected from those lands in which bhang is cultivated.
KISHENGARH STATE MEMORANDUM. 189 KISHENGARH STATE MEMORANDUM. (1) The hemp plant is cultivated in irrigated lands along with green vegetables by cul- tivators of the mali or gardener class exclusively. These cultivators are professional green- grocers and, as such, live in larger villages or towns only, where there can possibly be room for a market for green vegetable; and consequently the cultivation of the hemp plant is generally met with in towns and larger villages. The hemp plant is never cultivated as a principal crop, and is, as a rule, locally sold and consumed. There is practically no control of the growth of this plant. (2) The plant is cut and dried in the sun or shade and then beaten with sticks, and the leaves are then collected and sold as bhang. The flowering-tops of female plants are plucked and pressed under slabs of stones and taken out in a compressed state, which is called ganja. This is used for smoking. Bhang is imported from Shekhawati in Jeypur. Ganja is imported from Malwa. Charas is not made in Kishengarh. It is brought from Afghanistan by the Vilayatis (Kabulis) and by them sold to the local vendors. (3) The duties imposed on these drugs are as follows:- Bhang, four annas per maund. Ganja, one rupee and eight annas per maund. Charas, do. do. do. (a) A uniform rate of duty is charged all over the State, and anybody can sell any of these drugs. The administration of the system is carried on by the "Mapa" (Customs) Department. (b) Wild hemp is not found to any considerable extent in this State. It is regarded as an inferior kind of drug compared to cultivated hemp, and is consumed as bhang. Wild hemp is found in such small quantities that it has not been considered worth the while of the "Mapa" Department to control the possession and sale of such drug. (c) The cultivation of the hemp plant for the production of ganja or other drugs is not prohibited. The cultivation is found scattered all over the State in small patches or mixed with vegetable crops in the lands of larger villages and towns. (d) The baniyas and specially the Tambolis (betel-leaf sellers) are the importers of bhang and ganja. They are not licensed. No special arrangements are in force for their supervision and for controlling the storing and transport of these drugs. In larger towns, the duty is collected by the "Mapa" officers on the drugs entering the gateways. In the mofussil towns and in villages the "Mapa" officers go round in their circles every two months or so, and make collections of the duty on the imports of these drugs that may have been made during the interval. (e) There has been no system of licensing vendors in force for the last twelve years, or thereabouts.

190 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. The average retail price is as follows:JAISALMERE STATE MEMORANDUM. 191 JAISALMERE STATE MEMORANDUM. In the Jaisalmere State the hemp plant does not grow spontaneously. There are only three parganas where it is cultivated. In about 3 hals (61/5 acres) in Jaisalmere itself and about 1/3of a hal each in Deva and Fatehgarh the cultivation is carried on every year. Thus, in the whole State, only about 8 acres of land is being cultivated; the average production is esti- mated to be 33 maunds of "bhang" and "ganja." The cause of its not being cultivated in other parganas is the want of water required for its irrigation. In some parganas there being salt water, its cultivation cannot be carried on at all. The cultivation not being prohibited by the Darbar, the plant is left altogether uncontrolled. It is generally cultivated with vegetables and irrigated with well water. It is never cultivated in a separate area preserved for its own cultivation, as in other provinces. 2. The hemp plant is called by two names, male and female (cultivated). "Bhang" is the name applied to the dry leaves of the hemp plant, whether male or female. But the female plant, having little intoxication as well as not giving flowers (used as ganja) is not cultivated in the country. "Ganja" is the name applied to the dry flowering-tops of culti- vated male plant (not female as explained by Dr. Prain) which have become coated with resin in consequence of their inability to set seeds freely. "Charas" is not produced in this country, nor does any one consume it. The varieties of "ganja" explained by Dr. Prain in the introductory of the Commis- sion's questions regarding hemp drugs are neither known nor sold in this country. It is never trodden nor rolled under foot here. The leaves and the seeds having been separated, the dried flowers are selected and sprinkled over with water. They are then broken by hands and smoked. But as the flower-tops of "ganja" are detached from the twigs, whether the de- tachment has been accidental or deliberate, it may not be improper to call it "chur" or "broken ganja." 3. The hemp drugs are not manufactured and sold in the State. The plants are purchased by the consumers from the malis who cultivate them, and the preparations are made by them in their own houses. Sometimes the shop-keepers purchase these plants, and prepare and sell them to the consumers. 4. Owing to the want of good administration of the Customs Department, no statistics are available from year 1872-73, but as the new reforms were introduced in 1884 in this de- partment, the customs statistics have been obtained from that year. From the statistics, however, it appears that these drugs were never imported or exported even in a small quantity during the past ten years (from 1884 to 1893). This shows that only the amount produced in this country was consumed by the people, and they had no need of either importing or export- ing the drug, either for personal consumption or for trade. 5. There are no special acts or rules in respect to the control of these drugs, nor is there any controlling officer. They are, however, controlled by the customs officer as far as import and export is concerned. 6. The Customs Department levies an import duty of Rs. 3 per maund and a transit duty of Re. 1-8-0 per maund on these drugs; the export duty being exempted by the Darbar. 7. Besides the customs duty there is no direct or indirect tax imposed on the preparation or cultivation of ganja and bhang. The malis pay the usual tax for the land they cultivate, but no special tax for the cultivation of hemp plant is levied. 8. No case of smuggling "bhang" and "ganja" has come to notice up to this time, but the customs officer is authorised to fine the persons smuggling drugs. 9. As a very small quantity of these drugs is produced, no modifications of the present system are under consideration.
192 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. REPORT BY BRIGADE-SURGEON-LIEUTENANT-COLONEL D. D. CUNNING- HAM, F.R.S., C.I.E., ON THE NATURE OF THE EFFECTS ACCOMPANYING THE CONTINUED TREATMENT OF ANIMALS WITH HEMP DRUGS AND WITH DHATURA. Three distinct experiments were conducted in the Biological Laboratory attached to the Zoological Garden in Calcutta on the effects following the continued administration of hemp drugs and of dhatura to monkeys. In the first of them a monkey (Macacus rhesus) was subjected to frequent inhalations of the smoke of ganja during a period of many months; in the second, two monkeys (M. cynomolgus)were treated with almost daily doses of charas for more than two months; and in the third a second specimen of M. rhesus was caused to inhale the smoke of the seeds and leaves of dhatura periodically during a period of about six weeks. I regret that no experiment on the effects following inhalation of smoke derived from a mixture of ganja and dhatura was carried out. On learning that the Hemp Drugs Commission were desirous that such an experiment should be tried, I gave instructions for its immediate initiation, but as I was obliged to leave Calcutta almost immediately after doing so, my orders were apparently forgotten, and, on my return to Calcutta in July, I ascertained that no continuous administration of dhatura had been begun until the receipt of reiterated in- structions from Europe reached the laboratory in the end of May, and that then dhatura alone and not a mixture of dhatura and ganja was made use of. Whilst regretting that the wishes of the Commission have not been fully complied with in this respect, I do not feel sure that the results of the experiments, conducted as they have been, are not really more instructive than they would have been had the mixed drugs been made use of in the third, seeing that, in so far as isolated instances are capable of furnishing grounds for inference, a comparison of the phenomena present in the first and third experi- ments appears to indicate that, whilst prolonged, habitual inhalation of the smoke of ganja alone fails to give rise to any appreciable morbid effects on the cerebral nervous centres, a com- paratively brief exposure to the influence of habitual inhalation of the smoke of dhatura alone is accompanied by conspicuous injury to them. * Not reproduced. In carrying out the experiments there was no difficulty in securing the administration of charas so long, at all events, as the animals did not dislike the drug, as it can be mixed with milk, and the mixture was for some time freely partaken of. In order, however, to secure efficient inhalation of smoke of ganja or dhatura, it was necessary to provide a special apparatus, the nature of which is illustrated in the accompanying photograph.* It consisted of a chamber which could be hermetically closed at all points, save where a supply and a discharge tube were connected with its opposite extremities. The walls of the chamber were composed of wood covered externally by a coating of zinc, and contained two windows closed with plate glass, one in either of the lateral walls. At one end there was a sliding door fitting accurately into a brass lined groove. The supply-tube entered near the bottom of one of the terminal walls and the discharge one emerged towards the top of the opposite one so as to secure an even diffusion of the smoke throughout the interior of the chamber as far as possible. The supply-tube was connected distally with a large wash- bottle, through which the smoke from a chillum of ignited ganja or dhatura passed, and the discharge one with two large water-aspirators, which served to draw the smoke through the entire apparatus. The great difficulty was to secure that no leakage should take place at any of the numer- ous joints which were present throughout the apparatus, but this was overcome by the liberal application of cerate and clay, and it then worked most satisfactorily; the only trouble which was encountered lying in the tendency which the portion of the supply-tube nearest the wash-bottle had to become choked by resinous matter which had not been completely re- moved from the smoke during its passage through the water. The following notes indicate the details of procedure and results in the individual ex- periments. EXPERIMENT I. On the effects of the systematic inhalation of the smoke of ganja. Nature of the animal employed: Macacus rhesus weighing 16 lbs. The first inhalation was administered on the 7th of November 1893 and the last on the 12th of July 1894, so that the experiment extended over more than eight months. During this
REPORT BY BDE.-SURGN.-LIEUT.-COL. D. D. CUNNINGHAM, F.R.S., C.I.E. 193 period one hundred and eighty one inhalations were administered. During the greater part of the period the administrations were repeated almost daily save on Sundays, but during March they were repeated only on alternate days, and during April and May only at irre- gular intervals owing to the fact that at that time the animal was suffering from a mild but prolonged attack of dysentery. During the earlier part of the course of the experiment the animal apparently disliked the treatment as he violently resisted introduction into the inhalation-chamber, was restless when the smoke began to enter it, and not unfrequently attempted to prevent its entrance by plugging the orifice of the supply-tube. As time went on, however, and the experience lost its strangeness, his objections gradually diminished and were ultimately replaced by a positive desire for the treatment. He then readily entered the chamber, resisted any attempts to re- move him from it before he had had a full dose, was restless and uneasy on days on which the treatment was omitted, and on two occasions on which he managed to make his escape from his cage, showed an evident desire to enter the chamber on his own account. The symptoms attending the process of inhalation were not invariably of precisely uniform character. As a rule they came on quietly and insensibly and consisted in steadily increasing drowsiness, leading on to quiet sleep. During the course of exposure the conjunctiv and eyelids frequently became considerably congested, but this may, of course, have been merely dependent on direct irritation incident on their contact with the smoke. When re- moved from the chamber ere profound sleep had supervened the animal was evidently intoxi- cated. In many cases he was incapable of sitting up without supporting himself by means of grasping the bars of his cage, and, when less profoundly affected, being very unsteady on his legs. On being introduced into his cage, he not unfrequently either at once or after a short delay lay down and slept quietly for some time. On awaking from such sleep, as well as in those cases where sleep did not intervene, he almost invariably showed symptoms which appeared to indicate that he was for some time the subject of optical delusions. He gazed about attentively in directions in which nothing which seemed likely to excite his curiosity was present, and carefully scrutinised the floor of his cage for objects which did not exist. Such symp- toms continued to persist for a considerable time after all other indications of intoxication had disappeared, continuing to manifest themselves in greater or less degree during the entire course of the latter portion of any day on which the treatment had been administered in the morning. On a certain number of occasions, however, the symptoms did not follow this normal course. On these the onset of signs of drowsiness was greatly delayed and had hardly begun to show itself ere the animal was suddenly seized with violent general convulsions and imme- diately thereafter became profoundly unconscious. The symptoms on the recovery of con- sciousness in no way differed from those in cases where the earlier ones had followed the normal course. No satisfactory explanation of the occurrence of such exceptional phenomena could be arrived at, and it must remain uncertain whether they are to be regarded as the consequence of certain temporary subjective peculiarities on the part of the animal or of variations in the quality of the drug. In no instance was there any appreciable indication of the development of any cerebral excitement either during the administration of the drug or after intoxication had been fully established. The normal symptoms were those of simple drowsiness and loss of will-power accom- panied by optical delusions-those characterising the exceptional cases of temporary abnormal activity of the spinal cord and basal ganglia which may very probably have been dependent on diminution in the inhibitory power of the higher cerebral centres. The general health of the animal remained excellent during the entire course of the ex- periment save for a period during the months of April and May, in which he suffered from dysenteric symptoms. The occurrence of these, however, cannot be in any way definitely ascribed to the use of the drug as they are of frequent occurrence among monkeys in confine- ment apart from any special treatment. The only permanent appreciable effect resulting from the treatment manifested itself in the form of a very considerable diminution in appetite for food, which set in shortly after the initiation of the experiment and thereafter remained per- sistent throughout its entire course. At the desire of the Hemp Drugs Commission the experiment was brought to a close on the day following my return to Calcutta on the 12th of July 1894. Death was induced by means of prolonged administration of chloroform, and a post-mortem examination was con- ducted immediately it had occurred. The results of this were as follow in so far as mere casual naked-eye-inspection goes, for, as I have already pointed out, the detailed histological examination of the condition of the various organs and tissues is a matter not of a few hours' but of many weeks' work, so that it has been impossible for me to carry it out and at the same time to meet the wish of the Commission for the immediate submission of a report. Specimens of all the more important organs have, however, been carefully preserved and will form the subject of detailed histological examination hereafter. Results of post-mortem examination of the animal.194 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. considerable period not long before the close of the experiment the animal had been subject to an attack of dysentery, which would alone have been sufficient to occasion considerable loss of weight. On laying the body open the phenomenon which at once attracted attention as unlike any ordinarily present in caged monkeys, was the great amount of fat accumulated in the omentum, the mesentery and the visceral and parietal pericardium. This was specially note- worthy in connection with the markedly diminished ingestion of food which had characterised the subject of the experiment during the greater part of its course, and with the coincident considerable reduction in body-weight which had occurred. The body generally appeared to be fairly well-nourished and a considerable amount of subcutaneous fat was present. The lungs were quite exceptionally healthy for a caged monkey; neither of them being in the least degree adherent to the thoracic walls, the left one being apparently perfectly healthy, and the right merely showing a few patches of deep congestion towards the base. Under the influence of the osmic acid contained in the fixing solution in which specimens of it were immersed, the muscular tissue of the heart showed unequivocal signs of the presence of a certain amount of interstitial fat. Whether, however, these were due to true fatty degeneration of the muscular elements proper, or, as is more probably the case, to mere fatty accumulation in the connective tissue, must remain an open question until the detailed histological examination of the tissues has been carried out. The liver, spleen and pancreas appeared to be perfectly normal, save that, as in the case of the cardiac muscle, a slight excess of interstitial fat made its appearance under the influence of osmic acid. The kidneys, the stomach, the large and small intestines and the cerebro-spinal nervous centres were all apparently perfectly healthy. The only peculiar features in the body, then, which could in any way be rationally regarded as connected with the treatment to which the animal had been exposed, were the excessive accumulation of fat in the tissues of the omentum, peritoneum, and pericardium, and the tendency to the establishment of a similar accumulation in the cardiac muscle, the liver, the pancreas and the spleen. But the only persistent symptom attending the treatment during life was a considerable diminution in appetite for food, so that, in so far as the results of a single experiment afford any ground for inference, it would appear that the most important effect of the habitual employment of inhalations of the smoke of ganja is to give rise to diminution in the nor- mal processes of tissue-waste to such a degree that local accumulations of fat are liable to occur even in spite of the coincident and similarly originating diminution in the ingestion of food. The diminution in activity of the normal processes of tissue-waste tends, on the one hand, to give rise to decreased ingestion of food and on the other to local accumulations of fat in spite of this. But, if the habitual practice of inhalations of the drug really do produce such effects, it is clear that, in place of being hurtful, it may be positively beneficial to people who are obliged to undergo exertions without having the means of procuring a diet fully adapted to make good the amount of tissue-waste normally associated with these. As has been already pointed out, it is necessary to exercise extreme caution in coming to any definite conclusions from the experiment, first, because it is an isolated one, and, second, because the post-mortem examination has not yet been histologically completed, but the evidence which it has afforded, is, in so far as it goes, rather in favour of the use of the drug under certain conditions than adverse to it. EXPERIMENT II. On the effects of habitual ingestion of charas. In this experiment two small monkeys (M. cynomolgus) were employed. One of them, A, weighed 5 lb 7 oz., and the other, B, 4 lb 1 oz. A standard globule of the drug, representing the amount of his ordinary dose, was obtained from a habitual charas-eater. It weighed 1.05 grain and at the outset of the ex- periment one-twentieth part of that amount was daily administered to A, and one-twenty- fourth part to B, as approximately proportionate doses weight for weight, as compared with those of the man and his ordinary doses. The drug was rubbed up with a little milk and the animals readily partook of the mixture. Doses of the above amount were daily administered for some time, but, as they failed to produce any appreciable symptoms, the quantity was then gradually increased, until towards the close of the experiment as much as 3 grains, was given daily to each of the animals.
REPORT BY BDE-SURGN.-LIEUT.-COL. D. D. CUNNINGHAM, F.R.S., C.I.E. 195 The experiment was begun on the 31st October 1893 and continued until the 6th Jan- uary 1894, and during this period doses were administered on 62 days. The original small doses were employed until the 12th November when the amount was somewhat increased. On the 25th November the dose was raised to 0.52 grain, on the 28th December to 2 grains and on the 30th December to 3 grains. No conspicuous effects manifested themselves during the entire course of the experiment. At the outset the animals appeared for a time to be somewhat quieter than they had been previous to the administration of the drug, but, if this were in any way a consequence of the treatment, it was one of very transitory nature as it soon wore off, and during the whole of the latter part of the course of the experiment they appeared to be entirely unaffected in any way, and were quite lively. Their appetite for food underwent no appreciable alteration throughout. The rapid and considerable increases in the amount of doses of the drug which were latterly made unfortunately had the effect of bringing the experiment to an abrupt and untimely termination, for after they had for a few days partaken of doses of 3 grains both ani- mals simultaneously absolutely declined to touch the milk containing the drug, and, in spite of repeatedly renewed attempts to induce them to resume the habit, they have persistently refused to do so up to the present time. They were therefore only under treatment from the 31st October until the 6th of January, which was the last day on which they could be induced to partake of the milk, and the only noteworthy phenomenon which presented itself during the entire course of the experiment was the abruptness with which an extreme distaste for the drug set in. This is the more remarkable when compared with the phenomena which presented themselves in connection with continued treatment by inhalations of ganja. In the case of the ingestion of charas continued treatment was accompanied with the development of a dis- taste for the treatment, whilst in the case of ganja-inhalation it led to the acquisition of an abnormal craving for it. EXPERIMENT III. On the effects of habitual inhalations of the smoke of the seeds and leaves of dhatura. The subject of experiment, as in the case of that on the effects of the inhalation of the smoke of ganja, was a fair-sized specimen of Macacus rhesus. The treatment was initiated on the 1st June and continued until the 11th July, so that the experiment lasted for a period of about six weeks. In its conduct the same inhalation-apparatus was employed as in the first experiment. At the outset the seeds of dhatura were made use of as the source of smoke, but as the latter appeared to be undesirably potent, leaves were presently substituted for them and were persistently employed throughout the rest of the experiment. The symptoms attending the treatment were not invariably quite uniform in character. On some occasions indications of a certain amount of cerebral excitement were present for some time, but as a rule drowsiness and gradually increasiug intoxication manifested themselves from the outset, either alone or associated with symptoms of irritation of the respiratory apparatus as indicated by coughing. The animal was killed by means of prolonged administration of chloroform on the morn- ing of the 14th July and a post-mortem examination conducted at once with the following results: The lungs were not adherent to the thoracic walls,but were both deeply congested almost everywhere, and specially towards their apices in which numerous tubercular nodules and small cavities were present. Such phenomena are, of course, very frequent in the lungs of monkeys in confinement, but it remains possible that the general pulmonary congestion may have been partially due to irritation incident on the inhalation of the smoke. The visceral pericardium was almost devoid of fat and was somewhat thickened and opaque, especially over the region of the right auricle. The omentum and mesentery were also very free from fat. The spleen appeared to be rather anmic and was somewhat fibroid in texture. The liver, pancreas, stomach, large and small intestines, and kidneys presented no abnormal appear- ances. On opening the cranium the dura-mater was found to be somewhat thickened and, es- pecially in the neighbourhood of the superior longitudinal sinus, very conspicuously congested. In this region, too, the membrane in the occipital region was fixed to the cranial walls by soft, very vascular adhesions. The pia-mater was thickened and so highly injected throughout that the cerebral surface had a generally diffused pink tint. The cerebral substance was every- where abnormally soft and so friable as to render any immediate removal of the membranes impossible without the occurrence of much destruction of the nervous tissue. Like the sur- face, although in minor degree, it was of a pinkish tinge owing to abnormal accumulation of blood. Conditions of this kind appeared to be universally diffused throughout the whole of the cerebral centres, the texture of the hemispheres, of the cerebellum and of the basal ganglia being alike soft, and the evidences of abnormal congestion universally distributed. In spite of this, however, the spinal cord and its membranes were to all appearance perfectlyhealthy.
196 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. In so far as a single experiment goes the results in this case would, then, seem to show that the habitual inhalation of the smoke of dhatura, even when only practised for a relatively brief period, is sufficient to establish serious morbid changes in the cerebral nervous centres, and that it therein differs from the habitual inhalation of the smoke of ganja extending over a much more prolonged period. This clearly indicates the necessity of distinguishing between cases in which ganja alone is employed from those in which a mixture of ganja and dhatura is substituted for it, as otherwise certain prejudicial effects which are really due to the use of the latter drug may be erroneously credited to the former one.

REPORT BY MR. DAVID HOOPER, GOVERNMENT QUINOLOGIST, MADRAS. 197 REPORT BY MR. DAVID HOOPER, GOVERNMENT QUINOLOGIST, MADRAS, ON THE RESULTS OF ANALYSIS OF HEMP DRUGS. I have the honor to forward the results of the analyses of samples of hemp drugs sub- mitted for chemical examination by your Commission, together with those collected by my- self and others in this presidency. This is the first time that a systematic examination of hemp drugs from different partz of India has been conducted. Previous investigators have contented themselves with search- ing in commercial samples for the active principle, without first satisfying themselves as to the variation in the composition of the plants grown in different districts and under differ- ent circumstances. The active principle of hemp is contained in, and intimately associated with, the resinous secretion which is found in the leaves of the plant, and which is formed in abundance in the flowering tops when the cultivated female plants are grown by themselves. The resins in this secretion are associated with one or more alkaloids, existing in small quantities and not possessing the peculiar physiological action of the drug. The chief object of the analysis was not to determine the alkaloid, as in examining tobacco for nicotine, but to separate the resinous matter in as pure a condition as possible, taking the precaution to free the sample from excess of seeds yielding fixed oil. Other objects sought for in the examination of Indian hemp were the following: deter- minations of extractives directly soluble in spirit and in water; determination of nitrogen; search for sugar, and estimation of that body when present; a proximate analysis, showing the amounts dissolved by ether, and subsequently by rectified spirit and water, and the crude fibre and ash contents; nature of the ash, solubility of ash in water with estimation of alkalin- ity, solubility in acid, amount of insoluble or sandy matter, analysis of ash of ganja and bhang; proportion of seeds in ganja and bhang; composition of the seeds; nature of the resinous extractive. The literature on the subject of the chemistry of ganja has been referred to and digested, and Dr. Prain's " Report on the cultivation and use of ganja" has been read with interest; but before offering any remarks I will first enumerate the samples of drugs received, describe the methods of their analysis and give the tables of results. The samples of ganja.-In order to compare the composition of all the samples with those of acknowledged superiority, such as Bengal ganja, specimens were obtained through the Commissioner of Excise from Naogaon in Rajshahi district. The four kinds-large flat twig, small twig round and chur were typical specimens and were received in good condition. Surat, No. 1, was in matted heads with a fair amount of seeds. Surat ganja, No. 2, was in a loose dusty condition with many seeds and some stones. Besides these impurities, it gave a grass green coloured tincture, characteristic of bhang, and as leaves predominated it was placed among the bhang. The two kinds of Sind ganja came from Karachi; they were labelled " first kind known as Panvel ganja," "second kind or Sholapur ganja." The first specimen had a good odour and was broken up into smaller pieces than the second, which was in clean matted heads. The Commissioner of Excise, North-Western Provinces, sent some pieces of Baluchar and Pathar ganja used in Allahabad, but not grown in the provinces. These fragmentary samples did not admit of a full analysis being made. The North-Western Provinces supplied two illicit ganjas-one from Ghazipur, and the other from Basti. The latter was a small sample "ob- tained by a fakir from the border of the district or from the adjacent Nipal terai." It was rather seedy and dirty in appearance. The Ghazipur specimen was of a good green colour, but the leafy bracts were thin, and the tops were not agglutinated as in other samples. The Khandesh ganja bad the Dhulia post mark on the parcel, and was representative. The Satara drug was labelled "ganja flower tops"; it was seedy, it contained a few insects and had only a poor odour. The Ahmednagar specimens were interesting in having a different commercial value attached to each. One was sold for Rs. 55, the second for Rs. 50, and the third for Rs. 48 for three Bengal maunds. The retail price of each was 12 annas per pound. There was not much difference in their appearance, except that perhaps there was more stalk in the third kind. The Nasik ganja was in matted heads with fair odour, and almost entirely free from seeds. The Solahpur sample was clean and had few seeds; its composition was differ- ent to the Solahpur ganja imported in Sind. The Bijapur ganja had a few seeds, a slight musty odour and a brownish-green colour. Of the two specimens from Nimar district, one was marked "cleaned ganja raised from local seed," and the other "cleaned ganja raised from Dhakalgaon seed." The Hyderabad drug was of a good colour and fresh. With reference to the Madras samples, the two kinds purchased in the Ootacamund bazar were called "Javaj" or "Javathu" and "country ganja." The first is considered the best kind, and from its name very probably came from the Javadi hills; the second kind came from Coimbatore. An 50
198 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. authentic sample of ganja from Coimbatore was obtained with the view of comparing, it with the " country ganja." The Tanjore sample was sent by Dr. Mootoosawmy of that city, who stated that all the ganja was " imported from Chittore, Vellore and a mountainous village in the latter district called Kaleyimbody."* Bangalore also appears to be supplied with ganja from Vellore. The sample from Madras city purchased by the Commission was said to have been imported from the Jawadis. It had a cummin-like odour. Mr. Benson, Deputy Director of Agriculture, obtained several specimens of Ganjam ganja which varied very much in colour, odour and proportion of seeds. My analysis was made on a mixture of the better kinds containing few seeds. I am also indebted to Mr. Benson for procuring for me sample of the ganja prepared in Daggupad in the Kistna district. The small leaves alone with the flowering tops were very numerous, linear, with revolute margins, and very brittle. The fruit was set, and the bracts were covered with brownish glandular hairs, and the whole was very fragrant of southernwood. This sample is remarkable in yield- ing the largest amount of resin of all the others, including the Naogaon ganjas. The samples of bhang.-With the exception of the samples from Bhagalpur and Monghyr which were sent by the Collectors of those stations, all the others were forwarded by the Commission. They varied in odour and in amount of seeds and impurities. Some had entire leaves, in others they were broken up to a coarse powder. The bhangs from Bhagalpur and Monghyr had a marked peppermint odour, those from Bijapur and Sholapur had only a slight fragrance. The Khandesh sample was very much broken up and contained some seeds, while that from Amballa had its leaves twisted up like green-tea, and was remarkably free from seeds and foreign bodies. The samples from Surat and Hyderabad were much contaminated. In these cases the Surat bhang was powdered up and analysed just as it was received, and the Hyderabad mixture was sifted and the cleaned leaves only were used for analysis. The wild bhang from Assam had broad thin leaves, and a mousey odour. The leaves from the cultivated Rajshahi plants were lighter in colour, thicker, linear, with revolute margins, and a "herby" smell. The samples of wild hemp plants were allied to those of bhang, but being in smaller quantities they were analysed by a different process. From Basti, North-Western Provinces, three interesting specimens were submitted-a sample of bhang with staminate flowers, female hemp called the " ganja plant", and male hemp called the "bhangi plant." From Gonda two plants representative of the sexes were sent. One was said to be obtained from Ammar- pur, 21 miles east of Gonda, and was bearing staminate flowers; the other was a female plant from the same village in which the young fruits were developing. The specimen of wild hemp plant from Jaunpur, North-Western Provinces, consisted of leaves without any flowers or seeds and was stated to be used as ganja for smoking; but nothing definitely was known about this. Bhang does not seem to be sold in South India as a commercial article, but the leaves of the wild plants grown near houses are used by the natives for smoking. A specimen of such a plant was obtained from Pykara, on these hills, and its analysis resembles very strongly that of the wild bhang from Assam. The samples of charas.-In Amballa district, charas "mashak" sells for Re. 1-8-0 per seer. It has a dark olive-green colour, tough consistence and a peculiar fragrant aroma. The Amritsar, Delhi and Bombay drugs are very much like the above, although called by different names, such as "mashak", "bhara" and "dust", and sold at prices ranging from 12 annas to Re. 1-9-0 per seer. Gwalior charas occurred in black balls from the size of a pea to that of a nutmeg. The sample from the wild plants in the Kumaon terai were spindle-shaped and about 11/4 inch long. They contained seeds and much vegetable matter, and were very prob- ably obtained by rolling ganja in the hand. The Himalayan charas from Kumaon cultivated plants was in the form of large balls made by massing about a dozen small balls together. The Himalayan charas made from cultivated plants in Gurhwal was in two forms-flat, square- shaped pieces about 3/4 inch across, and round disc-shaped flattened pieces about 1 inch in dia- meter, with a hole in the middle by which they were strung together on a string. These had a heavy tobacco-like odour, and were black in colour. The Yarkand charas was a small hard cake weighing a few grains, sent in the samples of ganja and bhang from Allahabad. The Almora charas was a portion of a hard ball in which seeds and other vegetable debris were present. The two specimens from Nipal had the odour of musk. " A " was a sample of 1892 manufacture of good quality, and occurred in small rounded discs like Pontefract cakes. Sample "B" was two years old, and in cylindrical pieces, black and hard; it was called Shah- jahani charas. The methods of analysis.REPORT BY MR. DAVID HOOPER, GOVERNMENT QUINOLOGIST, MADRAS. 199 stand in warm water for a few hours. If cold water is used for the extraction, it requires more than 24 hours for complete saturation, and before that time the extract shows signs of fermentation. One portion of the watery extract was evaporated to complete dryness, another portion was precipitated with solution of acetate of lead to separate the organic acid, and the third portion, if sugar was present, was used to titrate a measured volume of Fehling's copper test. The nitrogen was determined by combustion with soda-lime, and existed in the plant mostly as albuminoids, although some was yielded by the alkaloids, and in some cases by a soluble salt of ammonium. The proximate analysis of ganja and bhang was commenced with ether, which is the best solvent for the active resins, and dissolves very little extraneous matter. The subsequent action of rectified spirit (sp: gr: o. 83) removed a resin acid, alka- loids, and in some cases a saccharine body reducing Fehling's solution. By adding together the ether extract and the resin acid, the result equals the amount of washed resin obtained by the direct spirit extract. If the spirit extract in the proximate analysis is much over 2 per cent., it points to the presence of sugar; absolute alcohol, on the other hand, does not dissolve this sugar so easily. Dr. Prain used petroleum ether for the first solvent to act upon the drug, and the dried extract obtained by this liquid was returned as " fixed oil, etc." If this were the case, then all the extracts of Indian hemp would consist mostly of fixed oil, whereas the ex- tracts from all ganjas consist, as I shall show presently, of resins with a small proportion of fixed oil. Petroleum ether is a good solvent of the resins, and is of no use in effecting a separation between them and the oil. The best method is to separate the seeds from the sample before the analysis, and so exclude the source of the oil. A misconception seems to have arisen from a statement made by Roux, a French Chemist, in 1887, that the ethereal extract is inert. If the ethereal extraction follows that of petroleum ether, then, perhaps, the product is inert, but direct exhaustion of the drug with ether certainly does not yield inert resins. Dr. Prain estimated, by an indirect method, the essential oil in some samples of ganja, and obtained some high results, over 6 per cent. in most cases. Indirect methods of estimating volatile oils give higher figures than by direct distillation, and are not to be depended upon. I have recently distilled one of the most fragrant ganjas, that from the Kistna district, and it yielded less than one per cent. of colourless essential oil, having the peculiar odour of the drug. The essential oil in the other samples has not been determined. The remaining analytical methods do not require any further explanation.

A fresh sample of "sadai" ganja from Co:mbatore contained a large number of ripe fruits, and as it was said to afford commercial ganja, I carefully dried some of it in the sun, and separated the seed3 from the other vegetable structures. The seeds weighed 53.5 per cent, of the dried sample, but if such a sample had been manufactured by being rolled or flattened out before it was dry, many of the seeds would have been lost. Some of the commercial samples of bhang contained much seed, notwithstanding the opinion that bhang is the produce of the male plant. The specimen of Hyderabad bhang, when cleaned, yielded 44 per cent, of seeds, with some stones and other impurities. In the case of a simi- larly impure specimen from Surat, the drug, after the larger stones had been "removed, was powdered up with the seeds and other impurities. The analysis of such a sample shows an increase in the ether extract due to the oil, and an increase in the mineral matter due to the sand, and is far from uniform with the other specimens. Twelve commercial samples of Ganjam ganja, very different in appearance, were found to contain from 5.1 to 38.7 per cent. of seeds, or an average of 20 per cent. As the seeds contain 25 per cent. of fixed oil, five parts of the ether extract obtained from an average sample of such ganja, without removing the seeds, would consist of oil. In preparing samples of ganja and bhang for analysis the, seeds that fell out in breaking up the drug were rejected altogether, and I do not think that, in the foregoing tables of analysis, more than a very small proportion of the resinous extract consisted of oil from the seeds. Composition of the seeds.REPORT BY MR. DAVID HOOPER, GOVERNMENT QUlNOLOGIST, MADRAS. 203 "The most recent and complete analysis of hemp speds has been published by S. Frankfurt (Landw Versuchs. Stat. 43.143.182 Journ. Chem. Soc., March 1894, p. 113). This ex- amination, it must be pointed out, was made upon European seeds:204 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. the district or town itself yields 14.46 per cent. The ganjas from Ootacamund, Bangalore, Tanjore, and Madras city come from the Javadi hill, yet they yield 21.68, 18.5, 17.37, and 13.92 per cent. of resins respectively. The "country ganja" imported from Coimbatore and used on these hills contains 14.64 per cent. of resins, but a sample obtained from near the town of Coimbatore gave 18.44 per cent. We may learn from the analyses of the samples from Nimar in the Central Provinces that, whether from local or imported seed, the ganjas grown in the same district and under the same circumstances yield similar products. With regard to the nature of the resinous extract of ganja, it is insoluble in water, but soluble in alcohol with a neutral reaction. A small amount of resin acid, about half per cent., was present in all the samples of ganja and bhang. A certain amount of the resins dissolves in warm potash solu- tion (one per cent.); a still further quantity is dissolved by treatment with alcoholic potash, evaporating to dryness, and washing the insoluble resin. Ganjas treated in this manner give from 50 to 60 per cent. of purified resin, and bhangs from 40 to 50 per cent. It is thus shown that the resinous extract of the bhangs is not equal, weight for weight, to that of the ganjas, as it contains a smaller proportion of purified resin which has been proved to be active. The bhangs contain from 8.31 to 12.63 per cent. of resins, or an average of about 10 per cent. which is one-half the amount yielded by average samples of ganja. Charas, it will be seen, con- tains, on an average of fifteen samples, about 40 per cent. resinous extract, which is double the quantity afforded by ganja. The ash of ganja and bhang.-The amount and composition of the ash of hemp drugs is more uniform than those of tobacco. The proportion of total ash of ganja is generally under 20 per cent. If it is over this proportion, a glance at the figures under "insoluble ash" will show that it is due to an excess of sandy residue. The soluble ash (alkaline salts) does not ex- ceed 3.43, nor fall below 1.67 per cent. The ash soluble in dilute hydrochloric acid (lime salts, etc.) falls between 13.57 and 8.68 per cent. The sand (insoluble ash) is the most variable constituent, as it ranges from 8.53 per cent. in the Tanjore sample to 2.18 per cent. in the Kistna drug. The alkalinity of the ash shows much attachment for the figure 1. The pro- portion of total ash in the samples of bhang in every case exceeds 20 per cent., a result which is due to the larger amounts of lime salts, as well as sand, than are found in the specimen of ganja. In the analyses of wild hemp plants, the male plants appear to yield more ash than the female plants, but the latter more resin. The composition of the Basti "bhangi plant" is not in keeping with the above statement, and is abnormal in yielding so much extract to spirit and so small a quantity of ash. Following is an analysis of the ash of bhang from Bhagalpur:- K2O CaO MgO Fe2O3 P2O5 SO3 Cl. SiO2 CO2 8.98 22.27 6.31 2.17 7.77 3.08 1.55 32.36 11.46 traces of manganese, undetermined, 4.06=100. The analysis of the ash of "chur" ganja from Naogaon gave the following figures:- K2O CaO MgO Fe2O3 P205 SO3 CI. SiO2 CO2 10.42 21.66 5.46 3.21 7.67 2.31 0.96 36.00 7.33 traces of manganese, undetermined, 4.98=100. There is a great similarity in the composition of the ash of ganja and bhang. They are both fairly rich in calcium phosphate, and the ash from ganja contains more potash than that of the bhang. Remarks on charas.-Charas has very seldom been examined chemically. Flckiger and Hanbury, in " Pharmacographia," second edition, page 550, report that charas yields from one- quarter to one-third of its weight of an amorphous resin, and Dr. Prain in his report refers to samples yielding 75 and 78 per cent. of resin. It will be seen from the results of my analyses of North Indian samples that the average yield of resin is 40 per cent. The highest is 46.5 per cent. in "mashak" charas from Amritsar, and the lowest is 22.3 per cent. in a sample of charas made from wild plant grown in Kumaon. The latter sample has the composition of a good sample of ganja. The samples from Amballa, Amritsar, Delhi and Bombay are remark- ably uniform in their composition and physical characters. They had a similar odour, con- sistence and colour, and all contained a large amount of sand. The Gwalior and Himalayan samples had portions of leaves and sometimes, seeds mixed with them, and left a quantity of vegetable residue after extraction with spirit, but there was not so much sand present. The Yarkand charas had some carbonate of calcium present, and the ash soluble in hydrochloric acid was consequently high. There was very little in the resin contents and appearance of the Delhi samples to determine their money value. The best quality had less resin and more sand than the other two kinds; it was more plastic and contained more water than they did. If alkaloids were the active principle of charas, then one would expect to find them in great abun- dance in this drug. But this is not so; some of the samples gave no indication of the presence of alkaloids, and the others only afforded traces. The amount of nitrogen is lower in charas than any other hemp drug. The Gwalior sample yielded 1.75 per cent. of nitrogen which apparently was derived from the vegetable matter, as the " mashak" of Amballa, which con- tained half the amount of insoluble vegetable matter, gave half the percentage of nitrogen (0.84 per cent). Remarks on majum.-The confection of hemp known as majum is differently made in various parts of India. In the north it is made with white sugar, in the south it is made with brown sugar and mixed with so many spices and other ingredients that it is quite black.
REPORT BY MR. DAVID HOOPER, GOVERNMENT QUINOLOGIST, MADRAS. 205 Allahabad majum was a whitish soft mass of peculiar ghee-like odour, and containing vegetable debris similar to that from ganja. It contained 4 per cent. of ghee and 1.3 per cent. of vegetable matter insoluble in water. There was no trace of alkaloid present. Benares majum was in cakes of the same colour and odour, and was nearly pure sugar. It contained 1.4 per cent. of fat, and 1 per cent. of leafy portions; no foreign seeds were discovered and no alkaloid could be detected. Bombay majum was in the form of yellow-coloured cakes flavoured with spice, and with very little ganja. It contained 4.9 per cent. of ghee soluble in ether, and 2.7 per cent. of brown vegetable matter referable to cloves, cassia and saffron. No alkaloid was present. Amballa majum was in opaque white masses with a slight greenish tinge and odour of ghee. It contained 7.3 per cent. of ghee soluble in ether, and no vegetable structures of a green colour as in other samples. No alkaloid was found. Hyderabad majum was in the form of square cakes covered on one side with silvered paper. One kind was white and contained 2.3 per cent. of ghee, the other was coloured yellow with saffron and contained only 1.2 per cent. No seeds or vegetable structures were observed. This had been doubtless strained through a cloth before being boiled down. With these samples came a mixture, wrapped up in a leaf, of powdered raisins and white sugar. When this was examined, several other substances were found, such as pieces of almonds, seeds of various kinds, stamens of some plant, some cereal grains and spice. The little black seeds were further examined microscopically and were found to consist of two kinds, one with three angles, probably from a polygonaceous plant, and the others were, in very small quantity, the seeds of dhatura. This is the only sample in which I have found dhatura seed present. Coimbatore, Ootacamund and Tanjore majums were black soft masses of a liquorice-like odour and sweet taste. An analysis was not attempted of either sample, but they were each broken down with water, and among the insoluble portion a search was made for dhatura seeds, nux vomica, etc., but without success. The amount of leafy organs, such as would come from the ganja, was in a very small proportion. In Ootacamund there is a black majum used for adults, and a white kind given to children, but as sold in the ganja-shop they are not very powerful preparations. 52

Bengal round ganja of the season 1892-93, which had been carefully packed in a per- forated deal-box and brought down to Calcutta from Nowgaon by Surgeon-Captain Prain in May 1893, was selected as the "standard ganja" with which the samples received from you were to be compared. Bhagalpur imported siddhi of the season 1893, which was received from the Board of Revenue, Lower Provinces, Bengal, in April 1894, was utilised as the standard bhang with which the samples received from the Commission were to be compared. C.-PREPARATION AND PERCENTAGE YIELD OF ALCOHOLIC EXTRACT. 1. Alcoholic extracts of the eighteen specimens of hemp drugs were prepared as follows: The coarser stalks were removed, and the leaves, flowering stalks and finer stalks reduced in a mortar to a powder, which was passed through a sieve having fifty meshes to the inch. Twenty grammes of the fine powder thus prepared were macerated during a period exceeding one week in rectified spirit to form a tincture. One hundred cubic centimetres of the tincture evaporated over a water-bath to syrupy consistence, and subsequently dried in a hot oven till the weight became constant, gave the alcoholic extract.

Besides the involuntary rocking movements described, other involuntary movements were occasionally observed, which are hardly to be explained on the same hypothesis. These other movements were of two kinds-fine tremor and spasmodic muscular actions. The tremor involved the whole body and was of intermittent character, an attack of tremor lasting three or four minutes with an indefinite period of complete freedom. Spasmodic muscular action was very rarely observed, and usually occurred in the muscles of the head and fore part of the body, the head being sometimes suddenly and forcibly moved to one or other side.

It walks also in the peculiar crawling manner. But the effects must be described as very slight. On the same day, at 1-15 P.M., a third cat received a dose of alcohol in quantity equal to that used to dissolve the alcoholic extract. The alcohol was mixed with a little water and administered in the usual manner. No apparent effect was produced. In preparing the emulsion as much alcohol as possible is driven off by heat after adding the starch solution. In this case the experiment being for purposes of control, no attempt was made to reduce the quantity of alcohol by heating. The effects produced by a dose equal to 1/110,000 part of the body weight appeared too pronounced, if other samples of hemp drugs were to be physiologically tested by this standard. And on the other hand the effects produced by a dose equal to 1/150,000 part of the body weight appeared too indefinite and slight. It was accordingly determined to try the results produced by a dose equal to 1/125,000 part of the body weight; and this quantity was given in the four next experiments.

Weight of cat 2 lb 131/4 oz. Dose .16 grain at 1-15 P.M. Effects produced very slight. A larger dose considered necessary. Experiment No. 6, Ahmednagar ganja, No. 1. Weight of cat 4 lb 131/2 oz. Dose .28 grain at 12-45 P.M. 1-30 P.M., cat is torpid and dull. 3 P.M., on being made to walk is found to have the characteristic staggering gait, the effect of the drug being more marked, as usual, in the hind limbs: it is distinctly drowsy. 3-30 P.M., the cat, on being disturbed and made to walk, takes a few steps and then passes into a sort of cataleptic condition, maintaining the posture in which it may have happened to be when it stopped moving. The position is not one in which its limbs are all at rest, and issometimes slightly grotesque. 4 P.M., is still very evidently under the influence of the drug: on standing the rocking movements of the body are well displayed. The minimum dose ofthis extract produced very well marked effects. Experiment No. 7, Ahmednagar ganja, No. 2. Weight of cat 2 lb 11 oz. Dose .15 grain at1 P.M. Action not sufficiently marked.

Experiment No. 9, Bijapur ganja. Weight of cat 3 lb 31/4 oz. Dose .18 grain at 1-30 P.M. 2-10 P.M., very marked tremor of the body. 3-30 P.M., the tremor of the body is the most marked symptom in this case: it has lasted for more than one hour, subject to intermission, and is still present. Rocking movements have also been observed with occasional spasm of the body. The cat, on moving, walks with the peculiar crawling gait already described. Experiment No. 10, Nimar ganja, Dhakalgaon seed. Weight of cat 4 lb 131/4 oz. Dose .28 grain at 12-30 P.M. 1-30 P.M., rocking movements. 3 P.M., cat less lively than usual; has a fixed look and is evidently not comfortable; no weak- ness of the limbs; drowsy but not markedly so.

The method of testing samples of hemp drugs by ascertaining their physiological value may be regarded as much more satisfactory in the case of ganja and bhang than in the case of charas. For it is submitted that ganja and bhang do not lend themselves so readily to successful adulteration as charas. Consequently, while the results of the physiological tests may be assumed to have a definite comparative value in the case of the various samples of ganja and bhang, no such reliable result can be claimed from the experiments with the samples of charas. There are three samples of charas of which the physiological value has not been determined, i.e., the three samples of Nepal charas. For when a dose of more than ten grains administer- ed to a cat weighing less than 41/4 lb produced no effects, it did not appear worth while to pursue the investigation further. Whether, however, these three samples are without physio- logical value due to successful adulteration, or to the absence of active principle in the ganja from which they were prepared, I am not in a position to say. To a varying degree the same remark applies to all those samples of charas in which the physiological value of the extract is much below that of the extract of the standard ganja. Alcohol is able to extract all the active principles present in any sample of hemp drugs. It will be seen on reference to table No. 1 that the quantity of the alcoholic extract varies greatly, and that it bears no relation to the physiological activity of the sample. As already stated this may be due in the case of charas to successful adulteration, but this is by no means to the same extent true in the case of ganja and bhang. In order, therefore, to obtain a true conception of the comparative value of any number of samples of ganja and bhang, they should be grouped, not according to the quantity of the alcoholic extract, nor yet according to the dose required to produce minimal effects, but accord- ing to the quantity of their alcoholic extracts which may be regarded as physiologically active. This has been roughly calculated and the results are given in table No. III. The samples of bhang yield a smaller percentage quantity of alcoholic extract than the samples of ganja. Their alcoholic extract is, in the majority of instances, much less active physiologically than the extracts of the samples of ganja. A point of considerable importance appears to be the great difference in physiological activity presented by the different samples of bhang. The doses of the bhang extracts range from 1/5,000 to 1/100,000 part of the body weight, a very much wider range than is presented by the ganja extracts. The bhang obtained from cultivated plants is at least four times as active as that obtain- ed from wild plants. The Assam bhang from wild plants possesses equal activity with the sample of Bhagalpur bhang obtained from the Board of Revenue and utilised as a standard.
REPORT BY SURGEON-CAPTAIN J. F. EVANS. 227 I would suggest that the other samples of bhang examined, i.e., Khandesh, Amballa, Sholapur, and Satara bhang were obtained either from cultivated plants or contained an acci- dental admixture of ganja. This would serve to account for their possessing greater physiolo- gical activity than the standard bhang. In conclusion, I have nothing to add to the foregoing remarks except that the ex- periments recorded, together with the necessary observations, occupied the greater part of each day during two months, apart altogether from the preparation of the alcoholic extracts half of which were prepared by Babu Ram Chandra Datta, 1st Assistant to the Chemical Examiner to Government.

228 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. REPORT BY DR. GEORGE WATT, M.B., C.M., C.I.E., &c., REPORTER ON ECO- NOMIC PRODUCTS TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. In reply to your letter No. 1969/181, dated 23rd April, and your unofficial reminder to hand, I have the honour to say that I had not intended to contribute anything towards the present enquiry into the subject of Indian hemp, because I have little to add that would likely be of any great value further than what is contained in my previous publications on that subject. Indeed, what I might be induced to say as to the botany of Cannabis sativa might fairly well be characterised as pure speculation, since I have had no oppor- tunity of personally confirming the impressions obtained from casual observation. Since, however, it seems to be the wish of the Government that I should offer some remarks, I may point out that while the forms of the plant met with in India are botanically only states of Cannabis sativa, I believe that, as with all other cultivated plants, there are recognisable races of that species. It would indeed be contrary to experience in other fields of study were it otherwise. The external differences between these forms are however very slight and such as the botanist is by universal usage permitted to disregard. In the herbarium they are indeed hardly distinguishable, though, from the cultivator's point of view, these slight differences may be indicative of widely dissimilar properties. Few botanists would venture to isolate aus, aman, boro, and rowa races of Oryza sativa; yet the rice cultivator of Bengal would have no difficulty in distinguishing these and many others; nor in fixing the period at which each should be sown and the nature of the soil on which its cultivation would be most successful. This, in my opinion, is an exactly parallel case, and I might mention many such to the wonderful problem of the production of so widely different products as bhang, ganja, charas, and hemp fibre from botanically one and the same plant. Some of the racial characteristics that exist may be mainly due to climate and soil; but it should not be forgotten that there are generally very potent influences in the production of races of cultivated plants. It would accordingly be most unwise to set on one side the possibility of differences, on the ground of these being mainly, or even exclusively, due to climatic and other such influences. I hold, therefore, that the study of the living plants on the part of a botanist might very possibly result in the isolation of the fibre-yielding plant of Cannabis sativa as possessing certain structural peculiarities more or less constantly associated with that physiological property, just as I believe that a similar isolation might be possible in the bhang, ganja, and charas-yielding states of the plant. 2. The practical bearings of this purely botanical contention might be very extensive and valuable. So far as I am aware, no botanist has as yet explained the formation of the narcotic in certain forms of Cannabis, and not (or practically not) in others. We may, in fact, be said to be ignorant of the precise use of that substance in the economy of the plant. Its discharge from the stems, leaves, flowers, and fruits seems to a large extent mechanical and to be dependent on some external disturbance, more especially an inter- ruption to the sexual functions of the individual. It may indeed be said to be uncertain whether the formation of the narcotic should be regarded as an excretary substance normally deposited within receptacles, or be viewed, in its early stage at least, as a substance intimate- ly connected with the metabolism of the plant, but which becomes a useless bye-product of life under certain conditions. But of course such excreta are only useless to plant life, in so far that they are not concerned in the further nutritive processes which accompany growth. This is important in its bearing on the probable chemical history of the narcotic. The solid and liquid contents of the laticiferous vessels, for example, of the poppy or of the India rubber plant are very different from the deposits found within glands. The former bear a distinct analogy to the blood in the veins of animals, while the latter might not inaptly be characterised as refuse matter. The contents of the laticiferous vessels may, however, be said to be of two chief kinds-(a) those which are constantly being used up in the growth of tissues, such as the proteids, carbo-hydrates, fats, and ferments; and (b) the secretions and excretions ultimately thrown down within these vessels or their vesicular modifications, such as the resins, gums, alkaloids, etc. Through the action of ferments many of the latter subsequently become available for the future growth of the plant, so that they are more properly stores of food than excreta. But the purely excretary matter stored up by plants in their variously formed receptacles may be here mentioned, such as granules of calcium oxulate; resins and ethereal oils combined usually into balsam, mucus, various kinds of gums; and lastly tannins (some tannins are, however, reserve-materials). These and such like are the excretary deposits, and they are made normally within individual cells dispersed through the tissue or into cells arranged in rows forming vesicles between the vascular bundles. Sometimes also the receptacles of secretion are intercellular spaces of various shapes and sizes filled by the discharges from the abutting cells A well-marked modification of this might be mentioned in the resin and gum passages which are formed by the separation of
REPORT BY DR. GEORGE WATT, M.B., C.M., C.I.E. 229 rows of cells, thus producing intercellular chambers of considerable length. A point of importance that may be here specially mentioned is the fact that excretary deposits of the nature here discussed are made from the very earliest period of individual life; in other words, anterior to the formation of even vascular tissue and consequently long before the stage at which flowers and fruits are formed. But there are further purely epidermal receptacles of secretion quite distinct from those discussed above. To this class belongs, according to the commonly accepted views, the deposits of the narcotic in the hemp plant. Epidermal receptacles are generally designated as glands, but in the vast majority of cases these contain only ethereal oils with resins dissolved in them. And there are two classes of glands230 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. peculiar form of the narcotic-yielding plant is found. Without therefore entering on the subject of the deleterious nature or otherwise of the drug, I may safely say that, in my opinion, it would be undesirable to impose restrictions of equal severity on tracts of country where fibre is produced or where bhang only can be grown, as on regions of ganja or charas pro- duction. It would be quite as justifiable to prosecute occupants of houses where the wild plant occurred within a fixed radius. Legislature might rather proceed on the lines of the scientific limitations of the forms of the plants possible of cultivation and the character of the narcotic produced. 4. Before concluding I may add that, in spite of all that has been written to the con- trary, I still believe that India may one day come forward as a valued country in the pro- duction of hemp fibre. With the gradual extension of railway communications the valleys of the Himalaya will sooner or later be tapped, when hemp production may then be expected to assume considerable importance. But there are very possibly tracts of the central table- land of India similar to the Godavery district (where hemp fibre is a regular article of trade) which could easily grow the fibre-yielding forms of the plant and thus give to India a new source of wealth. It is therefore, in my opinion, a matter of considerable moment that this feature of Cannabis satica cultivation should not be lost sight of amid the conflicting mass of opinion likely to be recorded regarding the hemp narcotics. Note added by Secretary, Revenue and Agricultural Department. An illustration of Dr. Watt's argument may be suggested by the case of the flax plant Linum usitatissimum, which supplies fibre in Ireland and Europe and only oil-seeds in India. Attempts to grow flax for fibre in India have failed, and attempts to grow it for oil-seeds in Europe would probably fail also. If for any reason flax (fibre) were condemned as an injurious article, it would be very hard to prevent the natives of India from cultivating it for oil-seeds. Or if the oil-seeds were condemned as an intoxicating food for cattle, would the growing of flax for textile purposes be forbidden in Europe ? Letter from BRIGADE-SURGEON-LIEUTENANT-COLONEL GEORGE KING, M.B., L.L.D., F.R.S., C.I.E., Superintendent, Royal Botanic Garden, dated 18th June 1894, to the Secretary, Indian Hemp Drugs Commission. I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 455 forwarding, for the expression of my opinion on some of the matters touched on therein, a copy of a letter ad- dressed to you by Dr. G. Watt, No. 422, dated 31st ultimo. 2. In the first paragraph of his letter Dr. Watt reminds the Commission that, as in the case of other cultivated plants, so in that of Cannabis sativa, there are races. The most not- able of these races in Cannabis of course are the fibre-yielding race, found in Europe and in temperate parts of the Himalayas; and the narcotic-yielding race, found in the plains of India and other tropical parts of Asia. In addition to these well-marked races, I understand Dr. Watt to say that he believes that, by a prolonged and careful study of living plants of Cannabis, intermediate races might become recognisable. 3. In the second paragraph of his letter Dr. Watt expounds the methods and objects of the formation, within the tissues of living plants, of the substances which may be classified as (a) reserve materials, i.e., matters prepared by plants with the object of being consumed in the processes of growth. (Of this kind of product starch may be taken as a familiar example.) (b) Excretions, i.e., substances built up by the plant as bye-products, and containing matters which are really as much rejections from the food-stuffs of plants as are the matters rejected by animals at the conclusion of the process of digestion. These excreta of plants are not however actually voided, as is the case in animals; but are deposited in glands in various parts of the tissues. Familiar examples of these are gums, resins, and many of the vegetable alkaloids. Dr. Watt's own opinion as to whether the narcotic matter of Cannabis sativa is of the nature of a reserve-material, or an excretion, is contained in the last two sentences of the second paragraph of his letter. I may observe that, in the first chapter of his report on ganja, Dr. Prain gives his opinion in favour of its being of the nature of a reserve-material. 4. The third paragraph of Dr. Watt's letter is occupied with the consideration of the possibility of growing hemp for its fibre profitably in India, and presumably for export;while, in his fourth and final paragraph, Dr. Watt expresses his belief that " India may one day come forward as a valued country in the production of hemp fibre." The Commission are of course aware that, early in the century, the Hon'ble East India Company made an effort to grow hemp fibre profitably in this country in the way that still appears to afford the greatest probability of success, viz., by sowing seeds of the European fibre-yielding race. The com- pany's experiments, which extended over several years, were ultimately abandoned, the- evidence of the hopelessness of the scheme having been accepted as conclusive. Equally unsuccessful were later experiments made with the view of obtaining a useful fibre from the narcotic-yielding race ordinarily cultivated in India. Dr. Watt's present hope appears to be founded on the alleged existence of a tract of country on the Godavery " where hemp
REPORT BY DR. GEORGE WATT, M.B., C.M., C.I.E. 231 fibre is a regular article of trade," and on his expectation that there may " possibly" be " tracts of the central tableland of India similar to the Godavery district which could easily grow the fibre-yielding forms of the plant." As regards the growth of hemp fibre in the Godavery district, there should be no difficulty in finding out what the real fact is, i.e., whether the " hemp" grown there is "sunn hemp," the product of a plant of the pea family named Crotalaria juncea or ganja hemp. If the latter, then it might be worth while to repeat, on a small scale, the Honourable Company's experiment of growing from European seed. 5. The inner valleys of the Himalayas appear to me to be so handicapped by the heavy cost of carriage of their produce to a seaport as to make it unlikely that hemp fibre grown in them could compete successfully in the London market with fibre grown on the continent of Europe. Moreover, when one considers the number of fibre-yielding plants which are known to be indigenous to India, one rather doubts the expediency of selecting for encourage- ment the cultivation of a species of which even the fibre-yielding race yields a narcotic so potent as charas. 6. I regret that I am unable to explain the precise meaning of Dr. Watt in the sentence alluded to by you and which ends as follows: " tracts of country where fibre is produced, or where bhang only can be grown as in regions of ganja or charas production." From the context, I gather that Dr. Watt suggests that excise regulations should be relaxed in regions where the Cannabis plant produces fibre, even although it may also (as it in fact does) produce charas.
232 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. MEMO. BY BRIGADE-SURGEON-LIEUTENANT-COLONEL G. KING, M.B., L.L.D., F.R.S., C.I.E., DIRECTOR OF BOTANICAL SURVEY OF INDIA. 1. The plant familiarly known as Indian hemp (Cannabis sativa, L.) is really wild in no part of British India. But in all parts of India, and also in Upper Burma, plants of it may be found growing without cultivation near villages and gardens where hemp is at present, or has in former times been cultivated. In botanical phraseology, hemp is found in India, not as an indigenous plant, but as an escape from cultivation. 2. By physical conditions, I understand soil and climate. As regards soil, the drug- yielding variety is (as I am informed by Dr. Prain) grown on a large scale, and as a regular crop, only in Rajshahve, in some parts of the tributary mehals of Orissa, and in some parts of Central India. The soils of the tracts where it is so grown have not, so far as I am aware, been analysed chemically; physically they are known to be friable and well drained. Soil, however, does not appear to be a matter of much importance in the growth of the resin- yielding hemp. For, with careful cultivation, it can, I understand, be grown as a garden crop in any part of India. At elevations below 2,000 feet, the difficulty of cultivation is very slight; from 2,000 to probably 9,000 feet there is no difficulty whatever. At higher elevations than the latter it does not appear to be much grown. As regards climate there is little to be said beyond that a period of continuous dry weather, extending over three or four months of the year, is essential, and that temperatures like those prevailing in the middle zone of elevation in the North-Western Himalaya appear to be the most favourable for the development of the drug.
REPORT BY MR. B. C. BASU. 233 REPORTS BY MR. B. C. BASU, ASSISTANT TO THE DIRECTOR OF THE DE- PARTMENT OF LAND RECORDS AND AGRICULTURE, BENGAL, ON THE SPONTANEOUS GROWTH OF THE WILD HEMP PLANT IN THE DIS- TRICTS OF BHAGALPUR AND PURNEA. With reference to your letter No. 333, dated 29th ultimo, I have the honour, in the absence of Mr. W. C. Macpherson, Officiating Director of Land Records and Agriculture, on tour, to submit the following report on the spontaneous growth of the wild hemp plant in the districts of Bhagalpur and Purnea. The statements contained in this report are based on my personal observations and enquiries conducted in different parts of these districts. For this purpose I visited a large number of villages in Purnea and north Bhagalpur. I was informed by the Excise Deputy Collector of Bhagalpur and other gentlemen whom I had the opportunity of consulting on the subject that the bhang plant grows rarely on the hard reddish soil of the South Gangetic division of the Bhagalpur district, and for this reason, and also on account of the extremely short time within which I was required to submit my report, I was obliged to leave this tract of country out of the scope of my enquiries. 2. The prevailing soil of north Bhagalpur and of Purnea is of a more or less sandy character and of a light grey colour; loamy soils are occasionally found in the low rice lands, and clay soils are practically unknown. The different parts of these districts suffer unequally from floods. Some tracts enjoy complete immunity from floods; some are inundated only during short periods when the rivers rise very high, and even then a considerable area of each village remains above water, while in others the villages are completely inundated by water on all sides during the entire rainy season, the houses alone with little bits of elevated land adjoining thereto remaining above water. I tried to extend my enquiries to every typical tract of country in north Bhagalpur and Purnea, and I trust that what I have said below with regard to the spontaneous growth of the bhang plant will apply equally to the whole of these districts. 3. There appears to be some confusion about the right use of the terms "alluvial lands," "dearah" and " chur lands." "Alluvial land" is a very general term which applies equally to all lands that have been formed by the silting action of water. In fact, it includes almost the whole of Bengal proper and Bihar. By "dearah" or "chur" (which terms are synonymous) is meant land that is still in course of formation by fresh deposits of silt from a river which actually flows over it during the rains. It is unlike land which is inundated with the spill water of a river carrying with it little or no silt, and thus derives little addition or benefit from the inundation. In course of time, dearah lands may be sufficiently raised to get beyond the reach of ordinary floods; villages are settled on them, and gradually they lose their destructive character and merge into old alluvial lands. 4. The points on which the Commission have desired for information are: (1) The circumstances under which the hemp plant grows wild in those districts ? (2) If it grows on land that is submerged, for how long a period is such land sub- merged ? 5. To the second question I may reply at once that the plant will never grow in land that remains submerged under water during the rains. The floods of the Kosi come with sudden violence, so that it occasionally happens that the waters have reached the angiuas or quadrangles of the houses, and people have to wade through water in moving from one house to another. But this state of things ordinarily lasts for a day or two, and seldom for so long a period as seven days. The same is true of the floods of the Ganges, though they do not occur or subside with such suddenness as those of the Kosi. Bhang may grow on lands which undergo such short submersions, but I am satisfied that it will never grow on land that remains longer under water. The plant is essentially a weed of high and dry land. 6. I am not surprised that the evidence laid before the Commission was discrepant as to the question whether wild hemp grows on submerged lands or on the higher lands above the reach of floods. Very few of the villagers whom I questioned seemed to have any definite idea on the subject, some averring that hemp seed remaining in the soil retains its vitality for an indefinite time even when submerged under water, and that it sprouts as soon as the soil has become sufficiently dry after the subsidence of the flood, while others allege that the seed is bound to lose its germinating power under prolonged submersion. The following facts which I observed would, however, appear to lend support to what I have said above:234 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. Secondly.REPORT BY MR. B. C. BASU. 235 11. I have so far dealt with the circumstances under which the wild hemp plant grows spontaneously in Purnea and Bhagalpur. It is clear that the plant is never found on land that remains long under water, that it is as a rule found on homestead lands, such as are either cropped with mustard and tobacco, or are used as bathan for cattle. 12. There can be no doubt that Government is now foregoing what may prove to be an important source of excise revenue owing to the free use of bhang in those districts where the hemp plant grows in a state of nature, and, what is more serious is that no attempt is made to check the use of this noxious drug. The working man often stands in need of ganja, but bhang is the beverage of the comparatively well-to-do and lazy classes, and it is only reason- able that they should be called on to pay their share of taxation instead of altogether escaping from it, as is the case at present in many of the districts of North Behar. I have considered the possibility of exterminating the wild bhang plant, and if this can be done, as I believe it can, bhang may be grown under the same restrictions as ganja is at present cultivated in Rajshahi. I have said that the plant grows very seldom at a distance from the raiyats' houses, so that if the responsibility for eradicating the plant is thrown upon the immediate occupier of lands, I have little doubt that the weed can be exterminated in the course of a few years. If the plant grow like many other weeds in all circumstances of soil and situations, its exter- mination would be a work of great difficulty; but, confined as it is to lands immediately adjoin- ing the raiyats' homesteads, its eradication need not entail undue hardship on the cultivators. The plant comes up in November and occupies the soil till May, and although each weeding causes fresh plants to come up, yet two or three weedings given in suc- cession cannot fail to free the land for the year from this noxious weed. The point to be insisted upon is that the. plants should never be allowed to flower and seed. The seeds of the plant are easily carried from place to place; they are easily transported by wind and water, and cattle and goats, which occasionally browse on bhang, may drop seeds with their excrements in fields that may be previously free from the pest. The total extermination of the plant may therefore require several years of determined and continued effort. Efforts have been made from time to time to exterminate wild hemp in several police circles through the agency of village chowkidars, but they were of an extremely desultory character and conse- quently failed to produce the desired effect. In case it be decided to have the plant extermi- nated, I may suggest that an experiment may be made in a small isolated tract of country for two or three years in order to see if the plant can be wholly destroyed by a continued course of eradication. In continuation of my letter No. 1258-A., dated the 18th instant, I have the honour to submit, for the information of the Commission, the following facts which came to my notice in the course of my enquiries with regard to the spontaneous growth of the wild hemp plant in Purnea and North Bhagalpur. 2. I could find no evidence of the hemp plant being actually cultivated in any part of Purnea and Bhagalpur: everywhere it came up as a weed. In some places, however, where the plant did not grow in abundance and would, therefore, seem to be an object of considerable value to bhang drinkers, I observed signs of its having been looked after with some degree of care. As a rule, the people of these districts could not distinguish between male and female plants, the leaves of both being used as bhang, but one man pointed out to me a plant which was a female and said that this class of plants produced the best drug. It is not uncommon to see a few selected plants, mostly females, left on the ground; these acquire a nice bushy appearance, not unlike that of the ganja-bearing plant. All this made me suspect that the people knew a great deal more about the bhang plant than they were willing to avow. 3. I was told by several persons, among them a European gentleman who has long resided in North Bhagalpur, that bhang is often used to adulterate ganja. I am unable to vouch for the accuracy of the statement, but if it be true it will furnish a strong argument in favour of the extermination of the hemp plant from those districts in which it grows spontaneously at present. 4. Besides yielding the intoxicant drug the wild hemp plant is used in Purnea and North Bhagalpur as fuel, and occasionally, though seldom, the green plants are twisted in the absence of other materials at hand into a rough sort of rope for binding bundles of wheat and barley and carrying them from the field to the threshing-floor.

Ganja is grown in 60 or 70 villages in Nimar. The cultivation is confined to the west- ern half of the Khandwa Tahsil. The rainfall at Khandwa may be taken as an average for this tract. During the last 25 years this average has been 32.76. Soil. 2. The soils in which ganja is grown are known locally asNOTE BY MR. B. ROBERTSON, DEPUTY COMMISSIONER, NIMAR. 237 Harvesting. 9. About the first or second week of November the crop ripens, the flowering heads assuming a brownish appearance. Dhakalgaon ganja ripens 15 days later than local ganja. The twigs which bear the flowering heads are broken off, collected in baskets, and carried to a threshing-floor. There they are spread out, and a heavy roller is passed over them. This is done only the first day as a rule; after that, as the twigs begin to dry, they are pressed under foot for three or four days. By this process the twigs are almost entirely cleaned of their leaves, and only the flowering tops remain, the latter being flattened out. The produce is then known as " kalli." The "kalli" is afterwards taken to the cultivators' houses and there stacked in heaps, which are kept pressed down by a heavy weight. It remains like this for a week, after which it is packed in gunny bags, each containing from 2 to 3 maunds, and taken to the Khandwa store- house. Outturn. 10. The average outturn from an acre is from 12 to 15 maunds. The crop has in recent years been bought up by a corner of "dallals" at Khandwa, the ordinary price ranging from Rs. 5 to Rs. 7 per maund, according to quality. The average money outturn per acre is thus about Rs. 80 or Rs. 90, and the money cost of cultivation is estimated at Rs. 60. The selling price per maund at the Khandwa storehouse is at present as high as Rs. 15 or Rs. 16 per maund. Statement showing extent of ganja cultivation in Nimar during the last 20 years. Year.

238 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. MEMORANDUM BY MR. H. V. DRAKE BROCKMAN, OFFICIATING COMMIS- SIONER OF EXCISE, CENTRAL PROVINCES, ON THE CULTIVATION AND MANUFACTURE OF GANJA IN THE KHANDWA TAHSIL OF THE NIMAR DISTRICT. Ganja is sown yearly in about 100 villages, and about 600 or 700 licenses are issued each year. Seed is locally raised in the villages of Lohari, Karki, Panjhria, and Chhirbel; this seed produces a comparatively thin plant which does not branch off so freely as that raised from the seed obtained from Dhakalgaon in Indore. Dhakalgaon seed is sold at a minimum price of Re. 1 per ser; it has, on several occasions, gone as high as Rs. 2 per ser. The ordinary price of local seed is Re. 0-12-0 per ser. Seven or eight villages in the Dhargaon station-house circle use Dhakalgaon seed, and the ganja raised in them commands the best price at the Government storehouse. 2. " Pandhar " (chalky), "mand" (black with an understratum of yellow clay), and "kali" (rich black) are the soils most suitable for ganja rearing. The first two are the best; the last is also good, but in seasons of more than average rainfall retains too much water close to the surface. 3. Irrigation and plentiful manuring being indispensable, the same fields are used year after year. A single manuring produces an effect which endures for two or three years, so that there is no inducement to practise rotation of crops. 4. The land selected is well manured every third year in Baisakh (April to May), 16 to 20 full cart-loads being allowed per acre; the ordinary household refuse, cowdung, and ashes are used, and if the home supply is inadequate, more is purchased at the rate of Re. 1 per cart. 5. If gram or masur is not grown in the field, it is ploughed over once in January or February. In any case the ground is in Baisakh (April to May) turned over with the " hal" (" nagar" or earth-turning plough) to expose it to the sun, and then well " bakhared" to make it smooth and to break up all large clods. If it is the turn of the field to be manured, the manure is spread after the ground has been turned over, and is then worked in with the "bakhar." When the ground has been well soaked, i.e., about 15 days after the setting in of the rains, it is again turned over with the " hal " and levelled with the " bakhar." Seed is sown on a sunny day in the latter half of Asarh (June to July), i.e., 20 to 25 days after the setting in of the rains, an instrument called " sarta," which is worked along with a " bakhar," being used for the purpose. 6. For six days after sowing, a strict watch is kept, otherwise birds would do great damage when the seed germinates, which it does four days after sowing. Twenty days after sowing, i.e., when the plants are about 9 inches high, weeding of grass and thinning of plants begin; an implement called " kolpa" is used for the former purpose. A space of 6 to 9 inches is cleared between each plant and the next, the intervening plants being uprooted and thrown away. About six weeks after sowing, the first examination (prakh) takes place. All the male plants (" naria " or " bhangern ") which can at that stage be recognised as such are picked out and thrown away. The cultivators appear to be able to distinguish the pollen- bearing sacs (" ghungri ") of male flowers even at this early stage. This examination is repeated daily for about two months. Then comes a second examination with a view to eliminate those plants which combine the signs of both sexes ("adnaria"). These " adnaria " plants seem to be identical with the "abnormal female plants with some male flowers on them," of which mention is made in Chapters II and VI, Part I of Dr. Prain's Report. 7. There is yet another class of plant which is eliminated; this is called "moria," and is said to be identified from its bearing a cluster of flowers on the top. The " moria " plants are not injurious to others, but are eliminated because they are useless for the purpose of ganja manufacture, their flowering heads being devoid of resin, and consequently of intoxicating power. Sometimes they are allowed to remain in the field; if removal is determined upon the necessary action is taken a fortnight or so before cutting begins. These plants probably correspond with those termed " khasia " in Bengal-see Chapters I (page 2) and II (page 5) of Dr. Prain's Report. 8. During the fourth month, i.e., in October, the plants are irrigated; rainfall will from this time onward injure them by washing away the resinous juice they contain; where- as irrigation increases the amount of this juice. Three waterings are given, an interval of seven days being allowed between each. It will be understood that irrigation is only bene- ficial if effected after the rains have entirely ceased. 9. About four and a half months after sowing, i.e., generally about the 20th November, the flowering heads assume a brownish appearance, which is a sure sign of maturity. Cutting
MEMORANDUM BY MR. H. V. DRAKE-BROCKMAN. 239 then begins. Only the "bhuttas," i.e., twigs about 12 inches in length which bear the flowering heads, are picked; they are collected in baskets and emptied into a "khala" (threshing-floor). At night the whole of the day's cutting is spread out in a layer, 9 to 12 inches thick, and left exposed to the dew till the following morning. The next step is to press the pickings flat; this is done by men treading them under foot. Several heaps are formed, which are worked upon in turn, each being turned over and left to dry in the sun while another is being pressed. This process goes on for four or five days, and the ganja is then taken to covered sheds where it is stacked to a height of 5 or 6 feet, and kept down by heavy weights. After remaining in this state for about a week, it is packed tightly in gunny-bags, and taken to the Government storehouse at Khandwa. 10. Seven days' previous notice of intention to cut the ganja crop has to be given to the Tahsildar, and the whole crop must be removed to the Government storehouse within 30 days of the date on which permission to cut is granted. 11. The following is an estimate of the cost of cultivating an acre of ganja and of manufacturing the crop into the article supplied to wholesale vendors:240 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. REPORT BY MR. H. M. LAWRIE, C.S., OFFICIATING DEPUTY COMMISSIONER, BHANDARA, CENTRAL PROVINCES, ON THE CONSUMPTION OF GANJA AMONG THE POWARS. In accordance with the instructions contained in your office letter No. 4259, dated the 10th September last, I have the honour to report that a careful inquiry has been made by Mr. Gokhle, Extra-Assistant Commissioner, as to the alleged increasing use of ganja among the Powars. The conclusions arrived at by Mr. Gokhle are as follows:- 2. It is true that there has been an increase of ganja consumption among Powars in this district, but not more so than among other classes. The increase of consumption among Powars may have attracted greater notice than that among others on account of the higher position of this caste in the social scale. It is perhaps erroneous to say that Powars had a prejudice against the use of the drug: what prejudice they may have had was merely that entertained by people generally, and might be more correctly described as want of familiarity with its use than any objection to it. 3. Purchases by Powars do not always represent consumption by them. There are a number of Powars who are large rice cultivators, and who in the transplanting season have to supply their labourers with some stimulant. Finding ganja to be cheaper than country liquor and quite as acceptable to their workmen, some Powars appear to have in this way made large purchases of ganja-not for their own use. The character and habits of Powars have not varied at all, so far as can be ascertained, in consequence of the more extended use by them of ganja. It has been mentioned that there is now a saying among Powars that a man who does not take ganja is nothing but a girl, but it does not appear that the taking of ganja has made these people more manly. It does not mean much more than that to take ganja is looked on as the sort of thing a grown man does, just as in England among boys smoking is sometimes looked on as a sign of emancipation from the school-room. It may to a certain extent refer to the supposed aphrodisiac qualities of the drug. 4. From the accompanying statements which Mr. Gokhle has had prepared, it will be seen that while the increase of ganja sales in shops where there are many Powars from 1891-92 to 1893-94 is only 31 per cent., that in shops where there are comparatively few Powar customers is, for the same period, 42 per cent. In the case of shops where there are no Powar purchasers the increase is only 12 per cent.; but this does not appear to be connected with the fact of the absence of people of this caste, but to be dependent on other circumstances. Among Powars, as among people of other castes, there has been an extension of the use of this drug in the last ten years; but the figures given in Mr. Gokhle's Statement II must not be taken to show a real increase in consumption to the extent of the increase in sales, since there is no doubt that a considerable amount of the increase is to be accounted for by the better arrangements now in force for the prevention of illegal ganja consumption. It is said that in the zemindaries on the south-eastern border of the district there used to be a good deal of ganja cultivation which has now been stopped, and that this ganja used formerly to be introduced into this district. But Mr. Gokhle's enquiries lead him to believe that, during the last four or five years in parti- cular, the use of ganja has become more familiar to Powars, as well as to members of subordi- nate castes. 5. The reason why the report was not submitted by the date mentioned in the concluding portion of your letter was partly the fact that Mr. Gokhle was temporarily transferred from the district for two months in the close of 1893, and the enquiries on this subject consequently interrupted. Recently Mr. Gokhle has been on tour in the Tirrora tahsil, which is under his charge, and where the Powars are in great number, and he has thus had a good opportunity of ascertaining by personal enquiries how the matter stands.

The true hemp plant (Cannabis saliva), though grown here and there in most parts of the presidency in backyards, is found as a regularly-cultivated field crop in only two localities, viz., in the Malayali villages on the Javadi hills in North Arcot, and in one or two villages in the Bapatla taluk of Kistna District. It is also raised to a certain extent in the hilly parts of Vizagapatam and Ganjam, but there seldom more than a few plants are grown by each person. The Javadis are a low hill rauge covered with jungle, amongst which the Malayali villages lie scattered, few of them consisting of more than three or four huts. Each village has a small patch of land cleared for cultivation near by, and there, in almost all cases, a plot or two of hemp will be found growing. The Malayalis claim to be Vellalas, but except for pur- poses of trade and barter have little or no connection with the people of the plains. They also claim to alone possess the knowledge necessary for the manufacture of ganja244 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. the pile a large flat stone is placed, upon which are piled other stones to weight and com- press the heap. The weights remain thus till next morning at about 8 or 9 A.M., when each layer is taken out separately, broken into small bits, and spread in the sun to dry. Whilst spread out thus, the pieces are trampled on with the heel and turned over from time to time to secure proper drying. In the evening the pieces are again re-piled and weighted and next day again turned out to dry; the process being repeated till the whole is thoroughly dried. Great importance is attached to the thoroughness of the treading, the sufficiency of the pressing, and the completeness of the drying; the quality of the drug being said to depend on the manner in which these processes are carried out. If the cakes are not dried sufficiently they appear green, and are of inferior qualityBULLETIN BY MR. C. BENSON, M.R.A.C. 245 A month after planting the fields are hand-weeded, and about a fortnight later a plough is run between the rows, and the plants are earthed up slightly. Two months after planting out flowering begins, and then the removal of the male (here as elsewhere termed female) plants begins. They are cut off near the roots and thrown away. This work goes on continuously as long as male plants are found. About February the plant begins to ripen and the harvest commences. It goes on till the end of March. The plants are cut bodily with the sickle, and are laid out in the field, where they grow for three days to dry in the sun. On the fourth day they are tied into small bundles of about ten plants each, and then piled, head and tail, in the field. The heaps are opened, and the bundles re-piled next day, the process being repeated over several days. When the quantity to be dealt with is small and space allows, the bundles are carried to the grower's house and there piled; but in all cases the crop is finally carried to the house, and a month later the spikes are removed. Each spike is plucked off by hand and then they are spread out on a hard floor in the open for one night in the dew to soften and become pliable. In the morning the spikes are collected and stored in large gunny-bags, being packed closely therein by a man treading them down into the bag. The produce is then ready for sale, and may be kept for as much as two years. In both localities it is stated that of late years the area planted with hemp has been reduc- ed, the price offered for ganja having fallen with the restriction of the demand owing to the introduction of the system of licensing retail vendors. A few years ago, the crop was also grown to some extent in one village in the Palivendla taluk, Cuddapah District, but its growth there has now been abandoned. It was then grown as a garden crop, in rotation with garden korra (Setaria italica) or garden ragi (Eleusine coracana),the plants being raised in seed-beds and then planted out. The method of manufacture adopt- ed there appears to have resembled that still followed in Kistna. 62

CAMPBELL, C.I.E., COLLECTOR OF LAND REVENUE AND CUSTOMS AND OPIUM, BOMBAY, ON THE RELIGION OF HEMP. To the Hindu the hemp plant is holy. A guardian lives in the bhang leaf. As the wife of Vishnu, the preserver, lives in the hysteria-curing tulsi, or Holy Basil, and as Shiva dwells in the dysentery-scaring bel, gle marmelos, so the properties of the bhang plant, its power to suppress the appetites, its virtue as a febrifuge, and its thought-bracing qualities show that the bhang leaf is the home of the great Yogi or brooding ascetic Mahadev. So holy a plant should have special rearing. Shiva explains to his wife, Parvati, how, in sowing hemp seed, you should keep repeating the spell 'Bhangi,' 'Bhangi,' apparently that the sound of that guardian name may scare the evil tare-sowing influences. Again, when the seedlings are planted the same holy name must be repeated, and also at the watering which, for the space of a year, the young plants must daily receive. When the flowers appear the flowers and leaves should be stripped from the plant and kept for a day in warm water. Next day, with one hundred repetitions of the holy name Bhangi, the leaves and flowers should be washed in a river and dried in an open shed. When they are dry some of the leaves should be burnt with due repeating of the holy name as a jap or muttered charm. Then, bearing in mind VNOTE BY MR. J. M.

At the other extreme of Hindu thought from the foes to stimulants, to the worshippers of the influences that, raising man out of himself and above mean individual worries, make him one with the divine force of nature, it is inevitable that temperaments should be found to whom the quickening spirit of bhang is the spirit of freedom and knowledge. In the ecstasy of bhang the spark of the Eternal in man turns into light the murkiness of matter or illusion and self is lost in the central soul-fire. The Hindu poet of Shiva, the Great Spirit that living in bhang passes into the drinker, sings of bhang as the clearer of ignorance, the giver of knowledge. No gem or jewel can touch in value bhang taken truly and reverently. He who drinks bhang drinks Shiva.

In fact it spread like wild- fire from one village to another among the ganja-smokers. Those that were not in the habit of consuming ganja also followed their example. The following circumstances assisted the spread of the worship:MEMORANDUM BY MR. R. G. CULLODEN. 255 MEMORANDUM BY MR. R. G. CULLODEN, ASSISTANT COLLECTOR OP CUS- TOMS AND SUPERINTENDENT OF THE PREVENTIVE SERVICE, RAN- GOON, ON THE SMUGGLING OF GANJA INTO RANGOON. Ganja has always been considered a prohibited drug in Burma. The prohibition of its importation has so far been successful that the drug has been kept out of the local market to a considerable extent; this is proved by the fact that whenever traced to any one possessing it, only very small quantities of the drug have been found on them. That there exists a demand for the article and that high prices are paid for it no one can deny; this is testified to by the many attempts that are made to smuggle it into the country, and on which even the heavy penalties inflicted on detected cases do not appear to have any deterrent effect. From the statement of seizures of ganja during the past five years, it will be seen that the illicit traffic is kept up with more or less regularity, the largest quantities coming from the Madras Coast. Advantage has also been taken of smuggling the drug by post. There are many amongst the consumers who cannot do without the drug, the want being felt by them as much as the want of alcohol is by persons addicted to its use. The follow- ing will illustrate this. A Madrassi sepoy was once brought up for being in possession of 3 tolas weight of ganja, he cried as though his very existence was at stake when told that the drug would be confiscated. He said that if it was taken from him, he would be unable to perform his duities, and as he was ordered to a station in Upper Burma, where it was impossible to obtain it he would die. He declared that he only indulged in very small quantities at a time and that it did him no harm. I have seen several similar instances of a craving for the drug, the accused in such cases being more willing to submit to a fine than be deprived of the ganja. From my experience I am inclined to believe that the moderate consumption of the drug has not the demoralising effect imputed to it, though I would not venture to assert that there would not be a tendency to the abuse of the drug, if the prohibition was removed. Punjabis, Pathans, natives of Upper India and Madrassi sepoys are those addicted to the use of ganja. The attempts at smuggling have been more frequent since the introduction of the Punjabi element in the police force; this is no doubt owing to a greater demand for the article. Judging from the physique of the latter race of men it would appear that the moderate indulgence in the use of the drug is attended with no ill effects. No case of Burmans making use of ganja has even been brought to my notice. Hemp is grown in Upper Burma, and Burmans, if they choose, could use it as a narcotic without let or hindrance. The Burma ganja is said to be inferior in quality to that obtained in India, hence it is not valued so much by the natives of India and smuggling is, therefore, likely to be always resorted to as a means of getting the latter article into Rangoon. The following recent cases of seizure indicate how ganja is smuggled. On the 6th July 1893 the customs preventive officers, acting on information, searched the S.S. Camorta from Madras, and found 5,481 tolas of ganja packed in tin cases concealed inside the paint lockers in the forecastle of the steamer. As this part of the ship is occupied by the crew, they were charged with having brought it on board, but they disclaimed liability and consequently penalty of 500 rupees was inflicted on the vessel, in accordance with the orders of the Government of India as per letter No. 5205, dated Simla, 10th October 1889, the amount being recoverable rateably from the wages of the crew. On the 21st of the same month, or 15 days later, another large seizure was made, the ganja weighing 6,613 tolas and packed in tins was found concealed partly in the lazarette and partly inside the linen locker of the S.S. Scindia from Madras. The captain handed over the butler of the first-class saloon as the guilty one, the key of the locker having been in his possession. The accused was convicted and sentenced by the Magistrate to pay a fine of 500 rupees, and this not being paid, he was sent to prison for three months and 20 days. On the 21st August last as much as 11,760 tolas of ganja were found in two cases landed as passengers luggage ex S.S. Nowshera from Madras. The gun- ner of Brooking Street wharf was implicated, as on landing those boxes he declared that they belonged to him. He was sentenced by the Magistrate to three months' imprisonment and to pay a fine of Rs. 500. His accomplice, a native, who brought the ganja by the steamer as his luggage was awarded two months' imprisonment. On the 18th of last month 2,420 tolas of ganja were found in a case declared to contain a sewing machine. The case was in transit from Madras to Mandalay and was consigned to a native at the latter place. It was allowed to go on to its destination and intimation having been sent by telegram to the Deputy Com- missioner there, two natives who came and took delivery of the case were arrested. There has since been another seizure of 3,360 tolas of ganja, the drug being found in a box declared to contain shoes intended for Mandalay. The case was dealt with in a similar manner to the fore- going one, but the result is not yet known.
256 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [APP. In 1888-89 the number of seizures was abnormally high, the aggregate quantity of ganja weighing as much as 17,753 tolas, and may be accounted for by the influx of a large body of native (Punjabi and Madrassi) troops consequent on the annexation of Upper Burma.

II.266 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. Serial No. Province. Name of witness. Number of witness. Name of Criminal. Witness's view of the case. Result of examining the records. 69 Assam Mr. Moran 33 Lala Kamar "I had a case of a man in my garden who cut off his wife's head whilst temporarily in- sane under the effects of the drug." It is a striking fact that Mr. Moran was examined at great length before the Ma- gistrate and never mentioned ganja. The record is quite against the ganja theory. The man seems to have been addicted to liquor. 70 Do. Mr. MCCabe 5 Not given "A Nepalese under the ex- citement caused by bhang cut down an inoffensive person whom he had never met before and with whom he had no sort of quarrel what- ever. The man was drunk at the time and committed the mur- der in a drunken fray of which the principal feature was that he demanded more drink. 71 Punjab Mr. Maconachie 8 Allah Baksh In 1892 "a fakir excited with bhang made a furious at- tack on a companion with his club." The man in a quarrel with his wife wounded her with an axe. Only one witness spoke to the use of bhang. Mr. Maconachie himself tried the case. 72 Do. Mr. Dames 9 Kalu Khan, Khosa "Kalu Khan stabbed a man with whom he had no previ- ous quarrel while under the influence of bhang." This is a very interesting case in connection with an effort on the part of the Punjab Gov- ernment to make the Khosas give up all intoxicants. 73 Madras Colonel Chrystie 65 Shekh Hussain "A peon, having been fined four annas, got into a high state of irritation and went and smoked bhang in a mak- kan in Anantapur at noon. The bhang appears to have excited him to madness." He beat an old man to death, and threatened others with a club. [ This case is quoted by several other Madras witnesses.] This man's asylum history should be read as well as the judicial records. He is one of the 1892 cases. He was punished as stated for a crime committed (as was supposed) when he was intoxicated. But inquiry into his antece- dents and his jail and asylum history show recurrent in- sanity, the outbreaks of which are quite independent of ganja. 74 to 76 Do. Mr. Stokes 10 Three cases "The 1st class Inspector of Police, Tirupatur taluk, gives three instances of murder which he attributes to this cause." There is really nothing to show that any of these cases was due to hemp drugs. They were cases of murder of a concubine in one case and a wife in the other two. 77 Do. Mahomed Anwar Saheb. 51 Kuppia This man killed his child on Kartika Nakshatram day "to send the child to God." There was evidence that he was under the influence of bhang. The High Court adopted this view of the case. 78 Bombay Nanabhai Cowasjee 60 Not given In 1885 certain Talavias com- mitted a riot in Broach, in which Mr. Prescott (District Superintendent of Police) was killed. The present report of the Col- lector shows that this riot cannot be attributed to hemp drugs. 79 Do. Mr. Sinclair 6 Kunjandas A servant entered his master's bed-room and attempted to throttle his master's wife. He was supposed to be under the influence of bhang. The records bear out this view. 80 Do. Do. Do. Not given 2. A Brahman was found in a temple with the broken image of a goddess. He was acquitted on the ground of insanity due to hemp drugs. The man was acquitted for want of evidence that he had committed the offence at all. He had, moreover, been insane for twelve years, and his in- sanity was attributed to seve- ral causes other than hemp drugs. 81 Do. Colonel Humfrey 51 Do. A sepoy ran amok and (before the Sessions Court) pleaded that bhang had been given to him. "I do not think the bhang caused him to commit the crime. I think it was established that the man had taken bhang, and if he did take it the crime was committed within half an hour afterwards." The High Court did not con- sider the taking of the bhangestablished. They held also that if taken, it was taken some hours before the offence; and they held that all his proceedings showed that he was not under the influence of the drug alleged to have been given to him, and that the offence was premeditated.
