INTRODUCTORY   REMARKS. THIS brochure, which it is hoped will be useful both to the medical profession and the lay public in India, gives, in popular language, a clear exposition of the present state of our knowledge as regards Sleeping Sickness. It is extremely improbable that this disease will ever obtain a foothold in India, but, as Captain Mackie remarks, it would be unwise to neglect precautionary measures. Up to the present there is no record of the existence of Tsetse flies in India, but it must be remembered that they can live in other parts of the world besides Africa, and there is no reason why, if once introduced into this country, they should not spread and multiply. It is not so very long ago that there were no rabbits in Australia. Moreover, it is by no means certain that the Tsetse flies are the only carriers of the parasite of Sleeping Sick- ness. The argument that in the old days of the slave trade negroes stricken with. Sleeping Sickness were imported into the New World without causing an epidemic of the disease is beside the point. We must allow for the increased facilities of communication which exist now-a-days, and which render possible the importation into India, not only of individuals and animals harbouring the parasite, but also of the insect carriers of the disease ; and we cannot afford to take any risks in this respect.

The Sleeping Sickness Commission of the Royal Society, 1908-1910. Constitution. COLONEL SIR DAVID BRUCE, ?t., C.B., F.R.S., A.M.S. CAPTAIN A. E. HAMERTON, D.S.O., R.A.M.C. CAPTAIN H. R. BATEMAN, R.A.M.C. CAPTAIN F. P. MACKIE, I.M.S. LADY BRUCE, R.R.C. The following is a short account of the present state of our knowledge of Sleeping Sickness and has special reference to the work of the above Commission. If in these pages any statements are found which seem to differ from those made in the official publica- tion of the Commission the responsibility for them is mine alone. In the compilation of this report, I have had frequent resort to the Bulletin of the Sleeping Sickness Bureau, to the Editor of which I tender my thanks. F. PERCIVAL MACKIE, M.B., F.R.C.S.,  M.R.C.P.,   CAPT.,  I.M.S. SLEEPING SICKNESS. Sleeping Sickness is a disease affecting man and is caused by a blood parasite, the Trypanosoma Gambiense (Dutton), which is transmitted by the bite of a species of Tsetse fly known as Glossina Palpalis (Rob-Dev). The disease is confined to the tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, but it is slowly spreading along the line of human communication. Distribution.-The clinical symptoms of this disease were recognised more than a century ago on the West Coast of Africa, and about that time the disease made its way into the New World amongst the negroes who were carried there from Africa as slaves. In 1901 Forde and Dutton who were working in the Gambia country found a trypanosome in the blood of a person suffering R
2                                    SLEEPING -SICKNESS. from fever and the parasite was called " Trypanosoma Gambiense " and the disease " Trypanosome fever." It was not till Castellani discovered the same parasite in the blood of persons suffering from Sleeping Sickness in Uganda and until the significance of his discovery was emphasised by Bruce and Nabarro that the relationship between trypanosome fever and Sleeping Sickness was fully recognised. By the labours of Bruce and Nabarro and of Greig of the Indian Medical Service and of Gray and the lamented Lieut. Tulloch of the Royal Army Medical Corps, the true relationship of the Trypa- nosoma Gambiense to Sleeping Sickness was established and the parasite was by these observers proved to be transmitted by a species of tsetse fly. Since then Sleeping Sickness has been found to be a much more widespread disease than was formerly supposed. It appears to have spread from West Africa throughout the basin of the Congo, thence into Uganda where it has caused a terrible mortality. Since then it has spread southwards into German East Africa and into Nyassaland ; northwards into the Lado enclave and into the lower Soudan. Recently there have been alarming reports that it is spreading southwards into Rhodesia so that altogether the increased extent of its distribution is giving rise to grave concern. The problem concerned with the disease may be discussed under four headings :- I.-The disease in man. II.-The parasite which causes it. III.-The fly which carries the disease. IV.-The reservoir of infection. I.-THE DISEASE IN MAN. The present Commission did not specially concern itself with this aspect of the question, but for the sake of completeness a few words must be said about the clinical symptoms.
SLEEPING   SICKNESS.                            3 I.-SYMPTOMS OF SLEEPING SICKNESS IN MAN. The incubation period is somewhat uncertain but is probably a matter of days or of a week or two at the most. We found that the incubation period in monkeys was almost invariably under ten days and nearly always either six or seven days. The blood of the monkeys was infective two or three days before trypanosomes were first seen in their blood by microscopic examination. The first stage of the disease is febrile and is generally put down to malaria. The pyrexia is intermittent and is probably associated with the recurrent appearance of the parasites in the blood. These febrile attacks may recur for months or even for years without involvement of the nervous system and the patient becomes anmic and debilitated. Rashes occur during this stage and are either erythematous or vesiculo-papular. Occasionally there are painful nodular swellings or plaques from which the trypanosomes may be recovered. They are apparently similar to those seen in horses suffering from dourine, a disease due to Trypanosoma Equiperdum. Dermatographia, a form of skin affection generally ascribed to vaso-motor disturbance, is not uncommon. These rashes, though they may be of great help in diagnosing Sleeping Sickness in fair skinned people, are difficult to recognise in dark skinned races. A sign first described by Kerandal and known by his name is that of deep hypersthesia. When the soft parts, such as the calves of the legs, are pinched or squeezed, acute pain is felt. The sign resembles that commonly found in some forms of neuritis and probably is due to a similar cause. The most important diagnostic sign is the enlargement of lymphatic glands, particularly those in the posterior triangles of the neck. The glands are soft and elastic and remain discreet, though they may become large enough to form an obvious swelling in the neck. This diagnostic sign is the most easily recognised of all signs and its value was greatly enhanced by the discovery made B2
4                                    SLEEPING   SICKNESS. by Captain Greig of the Indian Medical Service and Captain A. C. H. Gray of the Royal Army Medical Corps who found that trypanosomes could readily be found by puncturing the glands in a very large proportion of cases. (97.4 % Koch). The characteristic signs of the earlier stages of Sleeping Sick- ness are :-(1) Pyrexia (with or without trypanosomes in the blood stream). (2) Kerandal's sign (deep hypersthesia). (3) Certain rashes. (4) Cervical buboes (containing Trypanosoma Gambiense.) By means of these signs the disease can be recognised in quite an early stage. The second or cerebral stage (Fig. I & II) is the one which gives to the disease the name of Sleeping Sickness. The earliest sign is said to be a change in disposition and a loss of mental and moral tone. The patient becomes dull and apathetic and often dirty in his habits, showing at the same time a disinclination to work or to exert himself at all and a tendency towards somnolence on being left to himself. Fine tremors occur in the fingers and extend to the limbs and head ; incoordination and even Rombergs symptom is met with and rigidity sets in in certain muscles. Headache is common throughout the stage and occasionally hypersthesia or neuralgias. The Argyl-Robertson eye symptom is stated not to occur and Babinski's sign is absent. The other vital organs are not generally affected, but as the dis- ease progresses the patient becomes more and more somnolent and eventually passes into a condition of coma in which he may linger for days or weeks before death finally occurs. There are several features in the above condition which will remind the clinician of the late stages of general paralysis of the insane, and when one remembers the similarity of the underlying histo-pathological con- dition the resemblance of the two diseases is not surprising. II.-THE PARASITE OF SLEEPING SICKNESS. The Trypanosoma Gambiense is a protozoon belonging to the class Mastigophora,
SLEEPING   SICKNESS.                              5 In length it is from 17-28 microns and in breadth about 2 microns. When observed in the blood of man or experimental animals it does not vary much in size, but when undergoing development in the interior of the tsetse fly very great differences in size and shape may be observed. In structure it resembles other typical trypanosomes in possess- ing a macro-nucleus situated medially, a micro-nucleus near the posterior extremity and a well-defined undulating membrane which commences at the posterior extremity in the neighbourhood of the small nucleus and passing along the whole length of the body is continued anteriorly as a free flagellum. Reference to the accom- panying figure (Figs. Ill, VII & VIII) will make these points clear. The Trypanosoma Gambiense is an obligatory parasite, being only known to exist in the tissues of human beings suffering from Sleeping Sickness, in the tissues of certain of the lower animals and in infected tsetse flies. Some observers claim to have grown it in cultures on Novy's blood agar medium. Multiplication takes place by longitudinal division, the process beginning in the region of the micro-nucleus and extending forwards to result in the formation of two perfect daughter cells. Sexual dimorphism is suspected but has not been proved, and sexual conjugation has never been witnessed. The changes which the parasite undergoes in the body of the tsetse fly will be described later. III.-THE FLY WHICH CARRIES THE DISEASE. The tsetse fly Glossina Palpalis (Robinean-Desvoidy) is the insect responsible for the transmission of Sleeping Sickness. It belongs to the Genus Muscid of Dipterous insects and its general characters are made clear from the accompanying figure. (Fig. IV). It is a dark insect about the size of a " blue bottle " fly and in- habits a narrow belt of wooded country on the shores of certain African lakes and the watercourses of rivers. It is never found very far from water and is restricted to a narrow belt near to the water's edge and generally within a few hundred yards.
6                                     SLEEPING   SICKNESS. It has a quick almost noiseless flight, and settles suddenly on its victim, driving its long powerful proboscis deep into the skin and filling itself with blood in about half a minute. The puncture is generally quite painless but in some people is followed by mild irritation and by a weal or lump. The fly, which is thin and flat when empty, distends its abdomen to the shape and size of a small red currant after a feed of blood and then flies heavily away to digest its meal. Although it is curiously local in its distribution it sometimes travels on the bodies of men or animals or in canoes from one part of the shore to another, and even may be found a mile or two in- land when accompanying caravans. When the local conditions are favourable the flies swarm in large numbers and are exceedingly voracious, even biting Europeans through thick clothes. The Glossina are remarkable in that they produce a single living larva at a birth instead of laying eggs as is the manner of most flies. The larva which is a small maggot like-creature wriggles actively, and by this means burrows into the superficial layers of soft loamy sand by the water's edge, and in a few minutes becomes darker and motionless and becomes transformed into the pupa or chrysalis stage. (Fig. IV.) The perfect insect emerges after a time varying according to the locality and climatic condition but probably in about six weeks. Tsetse flies only bite in the day time and preferably in the heat of the day. The duration of their lives is certainly over 96 days, for the Commission kept some in captivity for that length of time, so that under favourable conditions in nature it is probably longer. THE FOOD OF THE TSETSE FLY. The natural food of Glossina Palpalis is a question which has received a great deal of attention. It is admitted on all hands that the tsetse fly is a pure blood sucker and there is no evidence whatever to show that it ever lives on vegetable juices. In its natural haunts near the water's edge on the fringe of vast forests there is plenty of animal life available.
SLEEPING  SICKNESS.                           7 Professor Koch was of opinion that the chief source of its blood supply was the crocodile, a statement which was misquoted to the effect that he believed the crocodile to be the source of Sleeping Sickness which he did not state. It is true that the tsetse fly will suck the blood of the crocodile just as it will that of almost any creature which contains blood, but there are many places where tsetse flies are found where there are no crocodiles. In the large majority of the flies caught on the lake shore there is no evidence of food of any sort ; this is doubtless because only the hungry and therefore empty flies come out and are caught. Thus out of a series of 220 tsetse flies brought to the Commission's laboratory for dissection, only 27 per cent. contained the remains of blood, and out of this number the corpuscles in 9 per cent. were recognised as being of mammalian origin and 4 per cent. non-mam- malian. In the remainder the blood was too far digested to enable one to recognise its origin. An experiment on a larger scale was carried out, expressly to determine the point, and full details will be found in paper No. 11 (vide Summary, page 37) from which the following extracts are taken. " A journey was made to a small " peninsula hereafter referred to as Crocodile Point." " The place was distant about two and a half to three hours by " canoe from the Kibanga landing place and lay in a sheltered bay " far out of the beaten track of the canoes which came backwards " and forwards between the islands of Kome, Damba and Buvuma " and the weekly market at the Kibanga clearing. " It was chosen therefore partly because it was isolated from " human influences and also because of the large number of flies "which lived there and the number of crocodile and birds which " frequented it. "When it was first visited a large crocodile was disturbed from " where she was lying outstretched on a spit of sand. The canoe " men at once set to work and unearthed fifty-eight crocodile's eggs " lying in layers about eighteen inches below the surface over which "the ' form ' of the parent was clearly defined in the soil. " The peninsula was pointed in shape and not more than sixty " yards long and was closed on the land side by the dense wall of " forest which fringes the lake shore.
SLEEPING   SICKNESS. " It was scattered with light undergrowth and fringed by am- " batch trees on which flocks of divers and cormorant sat with out- " stretched wings drying in the sun. " A barrier of bare rocks and boulders projected on one side into " the water and a small school of hippopotami was generally to be " seen floating near and basking in the sun. " Many small crocodiles were disturbed from the undergrowth " as the point was explored and various kinds of small land birds " frequented the reeds and shrubs. The soil was sandy loam and " shaded by light foliage. Tsetse flies swarmed. " Subsequent to the experiment the daily catch of Lake shore " flies was obtained from the place and incidentally it may be added " that the flies caught here were found to be regularly infective to " monkeys." Pup could be found in situation such as this by scraping the superficial layers of the sandy loam. As many as two thousand were found in a day by three trained pupa seekers. A rough dissection of all the flies caught on the point was made then and there, and those which contained the remains of a blood meal were smeared on a slide and brought to the laboratory for minute investigation. The result of the examination of 183 flies caught at Crocodile Point shows that nearly 60 per cent. of flies contained blood chiefly of  non-mammalian origin, of which reptilian blood was twice as frequent as that of birds. OTHER INSECT CARRIERS. This is the place to discuss the very important question as to whether Sleeping Sickness can be carried by any other medium than by the tsetse fly. Many experiments have been done to prove whether the Try- panosoma Gambiense can be transmitted by tsetse flies other than Glossina Palpalis. The same has been attempted with bugs, lice, mosquitos and other house parasites. In a few instances some of these experiments have proved suc- cessful, but in the majority they have been inconclusive and what is more important Sleeping Sickness has never been known to be
SLEEPING   SICKNESS.                              9 transmitted amongst human beings in the proved absence of tsetse flies. One has to guard against deducing too much from laboratory experiments, for in such cases all the conditions are made most favourable for the success of the experiment and factors which in nature come in to counterbalance or modify these conditions are eliminated. The French Commission described some localised epidemics of Sleeping Sickness on the French Congo with the view of throwing some light on this problem. They say " It appears that the agent of infection must be an insect biting in the night * when all the members of the family are together, an insect which passing from one to the other may carry the germ to everyone in the immediate surroundings of the patient by its repeated bites. It is mosquitos especially which seem to play the part particularly Stegomyia and Mansonia, which are so common in the Congo." They sum up as follows :- " Glossina Palpalis is the principal agent of infection. Its presence is absolutely necessary for the propagation of the disease to a distance and for the maintenance of endemicity, but in addi- tion mosquitos and probably other biting insects may be import- ant auxiliaries, having a formidable rle as epidemic agents, exercising their action in the interior of houses and amongst native families, sometimes even throughout villages." Todd of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine referring to the work of the French Commission writes : " Their conclusions entirely harmonise with our own observations." On the other hand the late Professor Koch wrote regarding a segregation camp where hundreds of patients were collected to- gether :- " They were in a country in which Glossina Palpalis is al- together wanting but other blood sucking insects which might be concerned are very abundantly represented ; there occur also in patches Glossina Fusca and Morsitans. * Glossina Palpalis only bite during the day.
10                                  SLEEPING  SICKNESS. In a district such as this the problem must inevitably be settled whether other insects are able to transmit the Trypanosoma Gambiense from sick to healthy men. To decide this very careful observations were made, but not a single case could be discovered in which such transmission had taken place by means of other insects than Glossina Palpalis." There is considerable doubt as to what is the transmitting agent in the form of human trypanosomiasis now spreading in Nyassaland and in Rhodesia. The tsetse Glossina Palpalis is said to be absent from those regions, but Glossina Morsitans is common and Glossina Fusca is also found. It is believed that Glossina Morsitans will be incriminated as it has already been proved to be the natural carrier of Nagana (T. Brucei) and it is capable of carrying Trypanosoma Gambiense by laboratory experiment. Some observers however doubt whether the Rhodesian Trypanosoma is Trypanosoma Gambiense at all or that the disease is identical with Sleeping Sickness as ordinarily understood. At present the whole question must remain sub- judice. The new commission going out under Bruce will doubtless clear up these points. There remains one more possible method of transmission, that is either by contact or by sexual intercourse. Koch believed the latter to be a probable mode of spread, and he brought some evi- dence to prove his contention. This theory has not gained ground, and does not accord with the experience of most observers though there are experimental grounds for believing it to be possible. A recent paper by Hindle (Parasitology, March 1911, page 24) shows that Trypanosoma Gambiense can be absorbed through the unbroken mucous membrane either of the alimentary tract or of the female genital passages of the guinea pig. He did not succeed in transmitting the disease in these animals from infected male to healthy female or vice vers by natural sexual intercourse. Application of infected material to the unbroken skin also gave rise to infection, so it is possible that in man simple contact with infected fluid without a skin lesion might suffice to transmit the disease.
SLEEPING   SICKNESS.                           11 Trypanosomes may, therefore, be transmitted in very varying ways-for the rat trypanosome (T. Lewisi) has been proved to be transmitted by the rat flea or by a species of rat louse, the human trypanosome disease of Brazil (Schizotrypanum Cruzi) by a redu- vial bug whilst dourine, an equine disease, is transmitted by sexual intercourse through lesions on the genital organs. The question has been examined at length because of its vast importance to India and to other hitherto uninfected tropical countries, but this part of the problem will be referred to later in the paper. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE TRYPANOSOME IN THE TSETSE FLY. As a result of the previous work on Sleeping Sickness it was supposed that the part which the fly played in transmission was a passive one, in fact that it was no more than a mechanical act and that the virus was carried on the proboscis of the fly just as vaccinia is carried on the ivory points of the vaccinator's lancet. Now we know that the tsetse fly plays a much more important part and that is in reality a true intermediate host and that Try- panosome Gambiense develops in the fly in somewhat the same way, though without such a defined cycle of stages, as the malarial organism does in the interior of the mosquito. The credit for the discovery belongs to Kleine who was working in German East Africa and who at the end of 1908 showed that a trypanosome disease could be conveyed by tsetse flies some 50 days after they had fed on an infected animal. We were very shortly afterwards able to confirm this discovery-he had worked with Glossina Palpalis and Trypanosoma Brucei whilst our experi- ments were carried out with the same fly and with Trypanosoma Gambiense. The details of the first successful experiments which are recorded in full in paper No. 2 (vide Summary, page 37) may be sum- marised as follows. The experiment was carried out with flies caught on the Lake shore. They were first fed once a day on two successive days on an animal whose blood contained Trypanosoma Gambiense. Then
12                                 SLEEPING   SICKNESS. they were starved for 72 hours to do away with any possibility of " mechanical transference " which was still believed to take place. For the next five days the flies were fed on a healthy monkey and hence forward changed on to a clean monkey every succeed- ing five days. The result was that the first two monkeys remained healthy, but every subsequent monkey on which the flies fed, up to 75 days, developed Sleeping Sickness and died. If seven days be deducted for the incubation period then the flies became infective 18 days after their first feed on an infected animal. There is no doubt that all the mischief was done by one fly, because though all the flies which died during the course of the experiment were carefully dissected and at the end all that re- mained alive were dissected, yet only one fly contained trypanosomes and that fly died on the 75th day. After its death no more monkeys became infected. This fly was swarming with trypanosomes of a Gambiense type and when a minute portion of the alimentary contents of this fly was infected under the skin of a monkey it promptly gave rise to Sleeping Sickness in the monkey. The salivary glands of the fly contained involution forms of Trypanosoma Gambiense and polymorphic forms of the same parasite swarmed in the fore-gut and mid-gut. (Fig. VII & VIII.) After this success a large number of experiments were done on similar lines not only using Trypanosoma Gambiense but also Trypanosoma Pecorum, Trypanosoma Vivax and Trypanosoma Nanum. In the first series of these wild or lake shore flies were used and they involved the fallacy that some of the lake shore flies were known to be infected in nature. When Fraser discovered the true breeding grounds of Glossina Palpalis large numbers of pup were brought up and hatched out in the laboratory and an abundant stock of " clean " flies was available. We were able also to ascertain that there was no hereditary infection of tsetse flies so that experiments with laboratory bred flies involved no fallacy.
SLEEPING   SICKNESS.                           13 Full details of these experiments are to be found in paper No. 8 which contains a mass of information of which the bare con- clusions were as follows :- " That Trypanosoma Gambiense multiplies in the gut of about one in every 20 Glossina Palpalis which have been fed on an infected animal. " That the flies became infected on an average 34 days after their first feed. " That a fly may remain infected for 75 days. " That Trypanosoma Pecorum, Trypanosoma Vivax and Trypanosoma Nanum may also multiply on Glossina Palpalis which must be looked upon as a possible carrier in these diseases. " That multiplication in the tube of the proboscis is character- istic of Trypanosoma Vivax." MECHANICAL TRANSMISSION. There were still some lingering doubts as to how far this late infectivity of the fly was responsible for the spread of Sleeping Sickness and what part, if any, was played by the hitherto believed method of mechanical transmission. Some experiments were, therefore, carried out with Laboratory bred flies to prove or disprove the point. In the first series of experiments a considerable number of flies were used and the infected and the clean animal having been placed side by side the box of flies was transferred rapidly from one to the other until all the flies had fed. In this way they were not given time to finish their feed on one animal but were constantly changed from one to the other. This method was called " interrupted feeding " and was carried on on twelve successive days. Five experiments of the sort were done and in two of them the experimental animal developed Sleeping Sickness which showed that the disease could be transmitted in this way. The second method consisted in allowing a variable time to elapse between the feeds and times were chosen from half an hour onwards to 48 hours.
14                                 SLEEPING   SICKNESS. When even such a short interval as half an hour was allowed to elapse between the feed on the infected and the clean monkey, no result was obtained and all the monkeys remained healthy. The conclusions we arrived at were that :- (1)  The mechanical transmission of Sleeping Sickness by means of Glossina Palpalis can take place if the transference of the flies from the infected to the healthy animal is instantaneous-that is by " interrupted feeding. " (2)  This mechanical transmission does not take place if an interval of time comes between the feedings. (3)  Mechanical transmission plays a much smaller part, if any, in the spread of Sleeping Sickness than has been supposed. WHAT HAPPENS TO TRYPANOSOMA GAMBIENSE WHEN IT GETS INTO THE BODY OF THE TSETSE FLY? Something was said about this question in Paper 2 (see Sum- mary, page 37) which has already been reviewed, but from the time of the first successful experiment there detailed right up till the time the Commission left Africa, an enormous mass of informa- tion was collected bearing on the question of morphological change in the parasite of Sleeping Sickness. It was important to trace the fate of the trypanosoma from the very first hour it was infested by the tsetse fly right up to the time that the fly became infective to monkeys and indeed as long as the infectivity lasted. It was thought that perhaps the trypanosomes would be seen to differentiate themselves into male, female and in different forms, that sexual union might be witnessed, and that a long cycle of changes as a result of the union might be recognised much as may be seen in the case of the malarial organism in the anopheles mosquito. One must emphasise at the outset that no such changes could be traced and there was no evidence to show that any sexual differen- tiation took place. To make the experiment a complete one cages full of tsetse flies were taken and fed on infected monkeys in such a way that a different batch of flies was dissected every day from one day on- ward to 56 days after the infected feed.
SLEEPING   SICKNESS.                          15 Sometimes it happened that when the flies came to be dissected on a particular day out of the 40 or 50 flies examined none were found to be infected-in this case that particular feeding had to be repeated and so in the end the series was made complete from 1 to 56 days which was as far as the experiment was taken. When an infected fly was found, a careful dissection was made and all its various organs isolated, carefully washed to exclude contamination, smeared on slides, stained and subsequently studied and drawn under a magnification of 2,000 diameter. In all cases, the organ specially studied were the proboscis, proventriculus, fore- gut, mid-gut, hind-gut, proctodum and salivary glands. More than six hundred selected drawings* were studied to form the basis of our conclusions. When these drawings were placed on a wall the horizontal rows represented pictorially the changes which the trypanosoma under- went, say, in the fore-gut from the 1st to 56th day, whilst those in a vertical direction represented the trypanosomes found in the whole length of one fly on a particular day. So that, as the original paper adds, " it seems impossible that any important form can have been left out." One must remember that it is only in a certain proportion of flies-8 per cent. in this series-that any development of trypano- somes takes place. What happens to them in the other 92 per cent. of flies is not known, nor why it is that the 8 per cent. are alone susceptible to infection. It was shown not to be a matter of chemical re-action, nor of the presence or absence of intestinal bacteria nor yet of the sex of the fly-it must be something more subtle. The original paper is already so condensed that it is difficult to do more than to emphasise the most important point and to refer those interested in the question to the paper itself. It was found that in the 92 per cent. of the flies referred to, the trypanosomes begin to degenerate a few hours after having been ingested and die out entirely in a few days never to re-appear. In the remaining 8 per cent. the parasites seem to degenerate and become fewer and at a later period to re-appear and undergo * All the work of Lady Bruce.
16                                   SLEEPING   SICKNESS. enormous multiplication. The appearance under the low power of such a fly is astounding-the whole alimentary canal is dis- tended with a seething mass of trypanosomes and the furthest confines of the dissection fluid quiver with them. Trypanosoma Gambiense does not undergo any development in the tube of the proboscis (a striking difference to Trypanosoma Vivax which in the same tsetse fly seems to infect the proboscis alone and to develop there). It is in the fore-gut, mid-gut and hind-gut that the chief multiplication takes place, and the type of parasite met here is bewildering in its variety. None of them are typical of those met with in the circulatory blood of the final hosts but there is one form so common as to justify it being looked upon as the " healthy normal developing type in the intestine of the fly." It is seen at all stages and in all flies. The other trypanosomes are made up of small forms, slender and crithidial forms ; resting forms (some of them not unlike Leishmania) and giant types- huge bloated masses of protoplasm full of chromatin grannules and waving with flagella. The behaviour of the trypanosome in the salivary glands merits special attention. They are not found in these organs until the 25th day after an infected feed ; it is only here that the trypanosome reverts to the normal blood type ; and before the 25th day the bite of the fly is not infective but it becomes infective synchronously with the appearance of mature trypanosomes in the salivary glands. To make the above facts more striking one may add that in all the salivary glands from flies which gave a positive result trypanosomes of a mature blood type were found. There is one important hiatus in the above description. How do the trypanosomes get from the alimentary canal to the salivary glands ? The analogy between trypanosomes and malaria is tempt- ing ; whilst the malarial parasite is developing in the stomach wall of the mosquito the insect is non-infective, its infectivity coincides with the presence of ripe sporozoites in the salivary glands which find their way there by the rupture of the oocyst into the body cavity of the mosquito. No one has yet witnessed this change in the life history of trypanosome. Very recently however Minchin
SLEEPING   SICKNESS.                             17 and Thomson have described the development of the rat trypano- some in the epithelial cells of the alimentary canal of its carrier, the rat flea. The conclusion arrived at may be summarised as follows :- 1.  In the   course of the development of Trypanosoma Gam- biense in Glossina Palpalis the proboscis does not be- come involved as in the case of some other species. 2.  A few days after an infected feed the trypanosoma disappear out of the great majority of the flies, but in a small per- centage this initial disappearance is followed by a renew- ed development. 3.  After a very short time the flies  which have fed on an in- fected animal become incapable of conveying the in- fection by their bites and their non-infectivity lasts for some 28 days when a renewed or late infectivity takes place. 4.  A fly in which the renewed or late infectivity occurs can remain infective for at least 96 days. 5.  An invasion of the salivary glands occurs at the same time as the renewal of infectivity and without this invasion of the salivary glands there can be no infectivity. 6.  The type of trypanosoma found in the salivary glands when the fly is infective is similar to the short stumpy form found in vertebrate blood and it is believed that the reversion to the blood type is a sine qu non in the infective process. Some more experiments of a different class were done to ascer- tain the question of the return of infectivity of tsetse flies. They were fed on animals infected with Sleeping Sickness, but instead of being allowed to bite clean animals or being subjected to microscopic examination their infectivity was tested by braying them in a mortar and injecting the resulting intestinal fluid with a hypodermic syringe into healthy monkeys. A number of these experiments were done and it was proved that the Trypanosoma Gambiense retains its virulence for about two days after ingestion by flies when administered in this way. c
18                                 SLEEPING   SICKNESS. After two days have elapsed they lose their virulence again, but it returns in a very small proportion of flies in about 22 days. From this it appears that the virulence of the trypanosome in the fly is lost for just about the same period that the fly is non- infective to animals when allowed to bite them in the ordinary way. In other words when the fly is able to transmit Sleeping Sickness by biting an animal, its alimentary and salivary contents are also infective when injected with a hypodermic syringe. IV.-THE EESERVOIR OF THE VIRUS  OF SLEEPING SICKNESS. Reference has already been made to the fact that it was believed that the way to stamp out the infectivity of the epidemic areas was to remove all the human population from the fly zone on the islands in and on the shores of the great Lake. Acting on this advice the Administration had done this, and when we began to work on the subject the lake shore had been deserted for about two years and most of the islands had been cleared of human population. No one was allowed within two miles of the water edge or on its water under pain of penalty. One of our first experiments was designed to ascertain how far these measures had succeeded in sterilizing the fly population and we certainly were not prepared for the result. We found that when batches of tsetse flies were caught at various parts of the deserted lake shore and were brought up and fed on healthy monkeys that these monkeys invariably became infected with Sleeping Sickness. The surprising conclusion was " that the Glossina Palpalis on the uninhabited shores of Victoria Nyanza can retain their infecti- vity for a period of at least two years after the native population has been removed." There were four ways in which this might be accounted for :- Firstly, the flies may occasionally get access to stray natives passing from the islands to the main land or others who have evaded the regulations.
SLEEPING   SICKNESS.                          19 Secondly, our own fly boys and canoe boys who go to catch the flies might have been suffering themselves from Sleeping Sickness. Thirdly, the life of the Glossina Palpalis may be longer than two years and the flies which were now proved to be infective may have become so two years or more ago. Fourthly, it is possible that some animals or birds on the lake shore are infected and so constitute a "reservoir " of the disease. We were able to satisfactorily exclude the first two possibilities, we could not deny the third though it seemed improbable. We thought that the reservoir theory was most likely to be the explanation and work was commenced in a variety of ways to prove this. As a result of these experiments it is not too much to say that a new chapter has been opened in the epidemiology of Sleeping Sick- ness as the succeeding pages will show. The proof of the existence of a " reservoir " is not scientifically complete, but there is little doubt of its accuracy. The important part which is played by wild animals in keeping up local infectivity to trypanosome disease was discovered by Bruce in Zululand and will be found detailed in his classical researches into Nagana or the tsetse fly cattle disease of South Africa. He found that the infectivity of the tsetse fly (Glossina Morsi- tans) was kept going by wild animals, particularly buffaloes, which frequented the cattle grazing grounds and which harboured in their blood the Trypanosoma Brucei and which every now and again broke out in virulent epidemic form amongst the domestic  stock. The phenomenon of " reservoirs " is comparable with that of carriers of enteric diphtheria and other diseases, a problem which now-a-days is so prominently occupying the attention of epidemiolo- gists in many parts of the world. It amounts to this that certain individuals who themselves show no symptom of disease are carry- ing about a supply of virus wherewith epidemics may be lit up in appropriate surroundings. In trypanosome reservoirs the animals which carry the virus are probably racially immune, whereas as in the above disease of man the immunity is only a personal one and acquired as a result of an attack of the disease from which the individual has recovered. c 2
20                                  SLEEPING   SICKNESS. To return to the subject of Sleeping Sickness the question was- Does some reptile, bird or mammal living on the lake shore act as a reservoir of the virus of Sleeping Sickness ? An answer to the question was sought in various ways : (a) The blood of various creatures could be searched in the hope of finding Trypanosoma Gambiense. (b) The blood of such creatures could be injected at once after death into susceptible animals. (c)  Blood   containing    Trypanosoma    Gambiense   could    be injected into various animals and the fate of the try- panosomes studied. (d)  Animals considered likely to be "reservoirs"   might be artificially infected with Sleeping Sickness and an attempt made to transmit the disease from them to healthy animals either by inoculation of blood or better still by using laboratory bred tsetse fly to carry the infection from the sick to the healthy animals. All these methods were used. For the first year or so of the time in Uganda all manner of creatures, lizards, snakes, amphibians, birds, and mammals were killed and their blood subjected to careful scrutiny. The result was that a regular museum of blood parasites was obtained, but neither the Trypanosoma Gambiense or any very near ally was found. A number of blood films were sent to England and were entrusted to the care of E. A. Minchin, M.A., Professor of Protozoology in the University of London, who kindly described them. His paper (No. 6) which is beautifully illustrated from his own and Lady Bruce's drawings may be studied by those interested in blood parasites, but as it has no direct bearing on the subject of this paper nothing further need be said about it. A paper (No. 1, vide Summary, page 37) entitled " Trypano- soma Ingens " contains an interesting observation on the subject of " reservoirs." This huge (amphibian like) trypanosome was found in the blood of cattle and also in bush buck, a species of wild antelopes, which frequented the same feeding ground as the cattle.
SLEEPING   SICKNESS.                            21 It is quite possible that one of these animals was acting as a reservoir to the other, but as neither seemed to suffer from the effect of the trypanosome, the subject in this particular instance is of academic interest rather than of practical importance. The second method of injecting the blood of a newly killed animal into a susceptible animal was also carried out in a number of instances, but without success. In most cases it was the blood of lake shore birds that was used, but that of hippopotamus, crocodile and antelope was also injected. It was not surprising that this method failed because where reservoirs exist they generally only form a very small proportion of the class of animals they represent. Then the blood has to be injected at once into the test animal, which in this case meant that monkeys had to be carried about on all shooting expeditions. This involved the fallacy that by taking a susceptible animal into a fly belt known to be infective it is liable to contract the disease naturally. The animals to which most attention was paid were those found most frequently on or near the lake shore. As a representative of the birds the common fowl had to be used, as it was not found pos- sible to experiment with the divers, cormorants and other species actually found on the lake shore. Next the domestic cattle were examined. Lastly the wild antelope which infest the shores were subjected to special attention. A number of attempts to transmit Sleeping Sickness by means of laboratory bred tsetse flies from infected or potentially infected fowls to clean monkeys were made-but with negative results. The conclusion was that the domestic fowl cannot act as a reser- voir of the virus of Sleeping Sickness, but we pointed out that this negative result does not necessarily apply to the birds found naturally in the fly area. Native cattle were then examined. The importance of the animals being a reservoir is obvious, for they go down to the water's edge daily to drink and generally live amongst the people in or about the kraals. They might act readily as a go-between if proved to be susceptible to infection with Trypanosoma Gambiense. The experiments detailed in Paper No. 8 (vide Summary, page 37) prove that cattle are susceptible to Trypanosoma Gambiense,
22                                  SLEEPING   SICKNESS. The  facts  brought  out  may conveniently be presented in the form of question and answer :- Question 1.-Are cattle capable of being infected with Sleeping Sickness by the subcutaneous injection of blood containing Trypanosoma Gambiense ? Answer.-Yes, they may be infected in this way. The try- panosome appears in small quantities in the blood, and the blood when injected into susceptible animals, such as monkeys, gives rise to a fatal form of the disease in them. Question 2.-Can cattle be infected with Sleeping Sickness by the bites of artificially infected Glossina Palpalis ? Here the tsetse flies were first fed on infected monkeys and after the necessary interval on an ox day by day. Answer.-Two experiments were performed to show that cattle could be infected in this way and that their blood was infective to monkeys. Question 3.-Can cattle be infected with Sleeping Sickness by the bites of naturally infected flies caught on the lake shore ? Answer.-Three experiments proved this possible and again the blood of the cattle was proved to be infective to monkeys and to a goat when it was injected into them. Question 4.-Is it possible to infect tsetse flies by feeding them on cattle suffering from Sleeping Sickness and after- wards to transmit the disease by means of these flies to healthy animals ? This experiment approximated still more to natural conditions of infection and nothing but laboratory bred and therefore " clean " flies were used. Five experiments were done, three were negative and two were positive. The experiments are so important that one will be given in detail to show how it was done. Experiment 1602.-Fifty laboratory bred flies were fed for four successive days on an ox whose blood contained Trypanosoma Gambicnse.
SLEEPING   SICKNESS.                          23 After a period of starvation they were applied to a monkey and a goat on alternate days. The monkey died (accidentally) before it could have become infected, but the goat developed Sleeping Sickness 20 days after the flies had had their first infected feed. The remainder of the flies, 32 in all, were dissected and five were found to contain flagellates. The alimentary contents of one of these flies were injected into a monkey and after an incubation period of 13 days Trypanosoma Gambiense appeared in its blood. Answer.-Laboratory bred flies can be infected by feeding them on cattle infected with Sleeping Sickness and after- wards the disease can be transmitted to healthy animals by means of these flies. Question 5.-Do cattle when living in the fly areas actually carry the virus of Sleeping Sickness ? This is the last link in the chain of evidence and again it was positive. One out of 17 cattle which were presumed to have been exposed to the bites of Glossina Palpalis was found to contain Trypanosoma Gambiense in its blood. Answer.-Yes, cattle in their natural state and apparently in good health may harbour the virus of Sleeping Sickness. As a final conclusion to this very important paper it was stated that it is possible that cattle and antelope living in the fly area may act as " reservoirs " of the virus of Sleeping Sickness and so keep up the infectivity of the tsetse fly. The next Paper (No. 18, vide Summary, page 37) shows how the problem was applied to the antelope. There are many antelope living on the lake shore besides buffa- los, hippopotami and other game, and now that the human popu- lation has been compulsorily removed the wild animals are greatly increasing in number so much so that the two mile zone is becoming a huge game reserve. The experiments with antelope were carried out on partially tamed animals of various species caught when young. A freshly  recovered strain of human trypanosome was used and only laboratory bred flies were used.
24                                   SLEEPING   SICKNESS. The steps of the scheme were very similar to those described in the last paper and the following questions were set for solution :- I.  Can   antelope   be infected with   Sleeping Sickness by the bites of laboratory bred and laboratory infected Glos- sina Palpalis ? Eleven experiments were done and all were positive, the answer is therefore in the affirmative. II.  If antelope can be infected with the virus of Sleeping Sick- ness, can they transmit the infection to clean laboratory bred Glossina Palpalis when these tsetse flies are allowed to feed on them ? Further if these Glossina Palpalis become infected, can they transmit the virus to susceptible animals ? To answer the question 24 experiments were done, and of these 17 were positive (7084 per cent.) The shortest time before the flies became infective was 24 days and the longest 49 days. It is interesting to note that tsetse flies were more readily infected from antelope and in a larger number than any other kind of animal used by the Commission. The observers add :- " The most significant of the above observations is the one in which it is shown that 55 days after the last feed of infected Glossina Palpalis on bush buck (Experiment 2328) the blood of this buck was capable of infecting clean laboratory bred flies though Try- panosoma Gambiense had never been seen in its blood. III. If Glossina Palpalis can be infected with the virus of Sleeping Sickness by feeding on the blood of Trypano- soma Gambiense infected antelope, what percentage of flies are found to be infected ? In the sixteen positive experiments 1,102 flies were dissected, and of these 119 (54 ? 65?  ) were found to be swarming with developmental forms of Trypanosoma Gambiense, that is about 10 per cent. IV. How does Sleeping Sickness affect the health of the ante- lope ? They do not seem to suffer any inconvenience from the pre- sence of the trypanosome.
SLEEPING   SICKNESS.                          25 The final question was-Are antelope living in the fly area naturally infected with Sleeping Sickness ? A large antelope drive had been arranged to try and prove the point, but the Commission left before it was carried out. The conclusions which terminate this important paper are given as below :- 1.  Water buck, bush buck and   reed   buck can readily be infected with a human strain of the trypanosome of Sleeping Sickness by the bites of infected Glossina Palpalis. 2.  One exposure to the bites of infected flies is sufficient to infect an antelope with the virus of Sleeping Sickness. 3.  Though the blood of an antelope may be proved to be in- fected with Trypanosoma Gambiense, careful and con- tinued examinations over prolonged periods may fail to reveal the presence of the parasite in the blood. 4.  The  incubation of the disease in the antelope is  probably seven days. 5.  Antelope  of the   water buck, bush buck and reed buck species, when infected with the virus of Sleeping Sickness, can transfer the infection to clean labora- tory bred Glossina Palpalis. 6.  This transmission of the infection to clean laboratory bred flies may occur at least 81 days after the last feed of the infected flies on a buck. 7.  Glossina Palpalis when infected with the virus of Sleeping Sickness obtained from the blood of infected antelope, are capable of transmitting the virus to susceptible animals. 8.  An appreciable percentage of Glossina Palpalis will become infected with the virus of Sleeping Sickness should these flies feed on antelope suffering from this disease. 9.  It follows from  the above conclusion that antelope living on the fly areas are " potential " reservoirs of the virus of Sleeping Sickness. 10.  No antelope up   to the  present has been found naturally infected with Trypanosoma, Gambiense.
26                                  SLEEPING   SICKNESS. Although the last link in the chain of evidence is missing, few people who read the above evidence or, better still, the original paper, will have much doubt as to the evil potentialities of the ante- lope as a reservoir of Sleeping Sickness. TREATMENT. It is outside the scope of this paper to say anything on the re- sult of treatment especially as with one exception the Commission did not touch on the subject. Suffice it to say that though many drugs have the power of driving trypanosomes out of the blood stream for the time being, none can be credited with effecting a permanent cure except per- haps in the very early stage. The course of the disease in man may be very prolonged and persons apparently cured have succumbed to the disease even eight or ten years after infection. Sleeping Sickness is still a disease with a mortality not far off an hundred per cent.* One series of experiments was done by the Commission to ascertain whether treatment of Sleeping Sickness patients with the usual trypanocidal drugs rendered them non-infective to tsetse flies, and as the question involved is one of great practical importance the experiment will be now outlined. In this case the Trypanosoma Gambiense was obtained directly from man instead of from animals infected in the laboratory. Firstly, an attempt was made to transmit the disease mechanically by the method of interrupted feeding from infected men to monkeys. Those who read the previous remarks on the subject of mechani- cal transmission will not be surprised to find that all the fifteen experiments were negative. Secondly, an attempt was made to transmit the disease from Sleeping Sickness patient to monkey after the parasite had completed its development in the fly. Six experiments were carried out on patients in whose glands trypanosomes had been found at some time or another but who still appeared to be in good health. All had received trypanocidal treatment. None of the tsetse flies became infected, that is to say, all the experiments were negative. * These remarks apply particularly to the disease as is met with in Uganda and surrounding countries. It seems that the West African type is not so dreadfully fatal.
SLEEPING   SICKNESS.                            27 In the next series patients were used who were in a more advanced stage and in whom the disease might reasonably have been diagnosed on clinical grounds alone. Twenty-five patients were the subject of the observation and of these six were untreated and the remainder had had trypanocidal drugs. All the treated and four of the untreated proved non-infective, that is, only two patients and those both untreated, proved to be infective to the flies which in their turn passed on the infection to clean monkeys. Finally, some experiments were done on patients on an advanced stage of Sleeping Sickness. Ten experiments were done and one was positive. This patient had been under treatment for a month and had been given during that time two grammes of soamin and 008 gramme of Perchloride of Mercury. Seventy-four flies from this positive experiment were dis- sected and four flies were found to contain flagellates on the 28th, 39th, 40th and 46th day, respectively, after their first infected feed. We may therefore conclude that- Firstly, Glossina Palpalis fed on natives suffering from Sleeping Sickness and untreated by drugs may become infected and be capable of transferring the disease to healthy animals. Secondly, that Glossina Palpalis fed on natives suffering from Sleeping Sickness and treated by arsenic and other drugs may also become infected and capable of transmitting the disease to healthy animals. THE PREVENTION OF SLEEPING SICKNESS. This may be attempted by attacking any one of the three factors on which the disease depends- (a) The human factor. (b) The tsetse fly. (c) The reservoir of infection. In the past the pandemic of Sleeping Sickness in Africa has been caused by the opening up of trade routes and by human intercourse, and it is by legislation applied to human beings that the principal efforts are being made to check its progress.
28                                  SLEEPING   SICKNESS. The infected areas are pretty accurately known and to a less extent the areas of potential epidemicity, the latter, in our present state of knowledge, being taken to coincide with the distribution of Glossina Palpalis or at any rate of tsetse flies in general. The enlargement of the cervical lymphatic glands is taken as a working diagnostic sign of the disease in the earlier stage and all persons possessing this sign are forbidden to enter non-infected areas. This is an excellent prophylactic method as far as it can be carried out, but the loopholes are numerous. Clearing the epidemic areas of human inhabitants is effective up to a point, but it means handing over the position to the enemy, and the present condition of the lake shore as our experiments show is probably worse than the first. It also has the economical disadvantage of giving back some of the most fertile parts of the country to the jungle. The prophylactic administration of drugs to the native has not been tried on a large scale, but from our experiments just referred to it would probably be ineffectual. Man does not appear to be capable of responding to the virus of Sleeping Sickness by producing any marked active immunity, so that channel of prevention does not seem hopeful. It is probable that the West African natives may have in gener- ations acquired some immunity, but there is no way yet known in which this can be hastened. Is it possible to stamp out Sleeping Sickness by exterminating the tsetse fly ? Without answering that question one may ask another. Has anyone succeeded in stamping out plague by exterminating the rat or the flea ? It is true that the tsetse fly may be got rid of in small areas by laying the country bare of trees and all jungle, but this as a general measure applicable to wide areas of infection is quite impracticable and may be dismissed as such. The third method of prophylaxis is that directed towards the destruction of the  " Reservoir."   If the antelope and other wild game in the fly zone are carrying and disseminating the virus of Sleeping Sickness, it is evident that they will have to be extermin- ated.
?SLEEPING   SICKNESS.                            29 It seems unfortunately true that the presence of game in any number is incompatible with the march of civilization, and this applies as much to stock raising in general as it does to Sleeping Sick- ness in man. The new Commission, which has just gone to Nyassaland to in- vestigate the question of Sleeping Sickness there, will make this question of animal reservoirs their special study. CAN SLEEPING SICKNESS GET A FOOTHOLD IN INDIA ? This extremely important question is one to which it is not possible to give a decided answer: the probabilities are against it, but it would be unwise to neglect precautionary measures. In another part of the paper it was stated that Sleeping Sickness had not been known to spread in the proved absence of tsetse flies, and authorities like Koch and Bruce have given decided opinions against the possibility of the disease spreading by the agency of any other insect. Mr. H. Maxwell Lefroy, Entomologist to the Government of India, states in the " Preliminary Account of the biting flies of India," p. 41 :- ". . . . There is no record yet of Glossina, the tsetse fly of Africa, nor is there at present any reason to believe that it occurs in India ; in fact the work of the last two years goes to confirm the belief that this genus will not be found in India." If this is true and if it is also true that the tsetse fly is a sine qu non in the distribution of the disease then India is safe. Consider- able support is given to this belief by the results of a natural experi- ment done on a large scale in the early part of the last century. In the days of the slave trade between the West Coast of Africa and the West Indies and the Southern States of North America negroes stricken with Sleeping Sickness were imported into the New World. The disease however did not spread, for although one may assume the presence of many parasitic insects the tsetse fly did not exist there. At the same time against this optimistic outlook one must remember that tsetse flies can live in other parts of the world besides Africa. They have been found in Arabia and some pup which we sent home from Uganda to the Zoological Gardens, London, hatched out as healthy insects.
30                                  SLEEPING   SICKNESS. There are many Indians living in Uganda and doubtless in other endemic centres of infection and most of these return sooner or later to settle in their native land. It is highly probable that from time to time the disease will be in this way imported into India from East Africa or the Soudan to the ports on the west side of India. IMPORTATION BY SEA. The Government of India are fully alive to this possibility and Regulations to prevent the importation of Sleeping Sickness into India were made as far back as 1903. In 1908 fuller precautionary measures were instituted and these are at present in force pend- ing new rules relating to Sleeping Sickness which are to be pro- mulgated as the revised uniform rules under the Indian Ports Act, 1908, for all infective and contagious diseases. The rules now in force are briefly as follows. If a case or suspected case of Sleeping Sickness or a death from the disease has occurred on board any vessel coming from a port beyond India, the master of the vessel shall report the same to the Boarding Port Officer. The Health Officer shall be immediately informed and he shall proceed on board and carry out the neces- sary examination. If any person is suspected to be suffering from Sleeping Sickness he shall be removed to a hospital and "shall be isolated in such a manner as will prevent, as far as possible, the communication of the disease to persons by the agency of biting flies and shall continue to be so detained and isolated until a Medical Officer authorised by the local Government on this behalf certifies that he is not suffering from Sleeping Sickness, or that having suffered from the disease he has been cured." In the revised Regulations referred to which are under consideration the rules are as follows :- 33. In the case of a vessel having on board a person suffering, or suspected to be suffering, from Sleeping Sickness, the person or persons shall not be permitted to land without the specific written permission of the Health Officer, who may, pending the receipt of written instructions from the local Government, permit the landing
SLEEPING   SICKNESS.                            31 of such persons  only if arrangements can be made for their strict isolation on shore. NOTE.-In suspicious cases the Health Officer should make a careful examin- ation for enlargement of the lymphatic glands, particularly those in the triangles of the neck. The pulse rate should also be taken. To confirm the diagnosis gland-juice should be taken and examined for the presence of trypanosomes. 34. In the case of a vessel arriving from the East Coast of Africa within the limits of Port Sudan, Durban, or from other localities declared to be infected, the procedure prescribed by rule 2 shall be complied with and the crew or passengers, etc., shall be medically inspected in accordance with rule 9. These regulations may be considered adequate as far as they go and should certainly not be relaxed in any particular. If a quar- antine station is needed the suitability of one of the islands in Bom- bay harbour (e.g., Butcher Island) should be considered, as it is improbable that much interchange of biting insects takes place between these islands and the main land. All the Soudan and Somaliland ports should be looked upon as possible sources of infection as well as those of the East Coast of Africa. The movements of cattle and camels and other animals between Africa and India should be watched in view of the fact that some may be acting as carriers of the infection of Sleeping Sickness. THE PILGRIM TRAFFIC QUESTION. The question may arise at some time as to whether similar precautions should be taken with reference to the return of pilgrims from Arabia to India. Large caravans of Muhammadans gravitate to Mecca from the West Coast of Africa and the endemic centres of Sleeping Sickness, and as a tsetse fly is known to exist in Arabia there are the necessary conditions for the dissemination of the disease. If this did occur it would mean that pilgrims in the early and most infectious stages of the disease might be distributed all over India. However, so far, Sleeping Sickness itself is not known to have occurred in Arabia, so that it may not be necessary to do more at the present time than to keep in mind the possibility of its so doing.
SLEEPING   SICKNESS.                               33 ADDENDUM. Since the main body of this paper was written a great deal of work has been done both in the infected areas and in Eu- ropean laboratories to clear up the questions concerning the identity of the new Rhodesian trypanosome and its carrier. Firstly, it has been shown that Trypanosoma Rhodesiense (Stephens and Fantham) is not identical with Trypanosoma Gambiense. This conclusion was arrived at by the considera- tion of certain morphological differences; by the greater viru- lence of the former trypanosome for laboratory animals than the latter possesses and also by means of the "crossed immunity test."  The last named test showed that an animal which was immune to T. Gambiense was still susceptible to and died as the result of an inoculation with T. Rhodesiense. Secondly, it was urged that T. Rhodesiense was in reality the well known cattle trypanosome of South Africa (T. Brucei) which is naturally carried by Glossina Morsitans and that this parasite had recently become pathogenic to man. Laveran from evidence obtained by his crossed immunity test and by serum reactions came to the conclusion that the two were distinct species. The evidence of morphology and of animal reaction also goes to disprove the identity of these two try- panosomes. Thirdly, can G. Morsitans (the cattle tsetse fly) transmit the Uganda form of Sleeping Sickness ? It has been proved by many laboratory experiments that T. Gambiense can be readily conveyed to monkeys and other animals by Glossina Morsitans and that it was, therefore, possible that the fly could take the place of G. Palpalis in areas unsuited to the life of that insect. At the same time opinions have been expressed that other tsetse flies, Glossina Fusca and G. Brevipalpis may be found to be capable of transmitting human trypanosomiases either in Rhodesia or elsewhere. There is no evidence to show that in nature the virus of Uganda Sleeping Sickness (T. Gambiense) is carried by any tsetse fly except G. Palpalis
?34                                 SLEEPING   SICKNESS. though   laboratory   experiments   show   that   in   theory    other tsetse flies can do so. Finally, there remains the question of how the Rhodesian trypanosome infects man. We have seen that this trypano- some is distinct both from T. Gambiense and T. Brucei, and we know that it is transmitted in areas free from Glossina Palpalis but which are infested with the other common tsetse fly Glossina  Morsitans. Stephens and Fantham sum up their observations (January 7th, 1912) as follows:-" It appears to us that the foregoing evidence is strongly confirmatory of the view we put forward in our original paper, namely, that we have two trypano- somes producing Sleeping Sickness in man, namely, T. Gam- biense and T. Rhodesiense and that the carrier of the latter species is Glossina Morsitans." In the Sleeping Sickness Bulletin which has just come to hand (No. 37, Volume 4, published May 11th, 1912) the report of the Luangwa (Rhodesia) Sleeping Sickness Commis- sion is reviewed and the conclusions arrived at by Drs. Allan Kinghorn and Warrington Yorke are so important that they will be quoted in full. " 1. The human trypanosome, in the Luangwa Valley, is trans- mitted by Glossina Morsitans, Westw. ' 2. Approximately 5 per cent. (4.76) of the flies may be- come permanently infected, and capable of transmitting the virus. " 3. The period which elapses between the infecting feed of the flies and the date on which they become infective is approximately fourteen days. "4. An infected fly retains the power of transmitting the disease during its life, and is infective at each meal. " 5. Mechanical transmission does not occur if a period of twenty-four hours has elapsed since the infecting meal. " 6. Some evidence exists to show that in the interval between the infecting feed and the date on which transmission becomes possible the parasites found in the flies are non-infective. " 7. Glossina Morsitans, in nature, has been found to transmit the human trypanosome.
SLEEPING   SICKNESS.                                35 "8. Certain species of buck, viz., waterbuck, hartebeest, mpala, and warthog, have been found to be infected with the human trypanosome. "9. A native dog has been found to be infected with the human trypanosome." It is interesting to note how closely the results obtained by these observers with the Rhodesian trypanosome tally with ours and the Uganda strain for, substituting Glossina Morsitans for Glossina Palpalis, the other facts are almost iden- tical with those which we elicited. To  summarise the whole position in a few words. There are two distinct human trypanosome diseases found in adjacent parts of Central Africa; one the Uganda form carried by Glossina Palpalis, the other the Rhodesian form carried by Glossina Morsitans. Both diseases are spreading outside their original epidemic area and they may continue to spread in those countries wherever the appropriate fly exists. In both cases a reservoir of infection exists in the wild game, and the tsetse fly carries the disease from game to man, and from man to game (possibly also from man to man) and in this way keeps up a vicious circle. If these new facts have any further bearing in India other than that already discussed, they should urge us to strengthen rather than to weaken our defences against the possible inroads of this dreadful disease.
