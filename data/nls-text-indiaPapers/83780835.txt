No. 2749. FROM LIEUTENANT-COLONEL F. J. DRURY, M.B., I.M.S., INSPECTOR-GENERAL OF CIVIL HOSPITALS, BIHAR AND ORISSA, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BIHAR AND ORISSA, MUNICIPAL (MEDICAL) DEPARTMENT. Ranchi, the 5th May 1913. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit herewith, for the information of Govern- ment, brief notes written by the Superintendent of the Patna Lunatic Asylum on the working of that institution during the year 1912, together with the usual statistical statements. The notes deal with all the salient points in the year's work. A few more explanatory remarks are made below. 2. Since the redistribution of the Provinces in April 1912, the Patna Lunatic Asylum is the only place for the reception of lunatics for the whole of the new Province of Bihar and Orissa. It is well known that the build- ing in which the Asylum is located is defective in many ways. It is an old antiquated structure quite unsuitable for an Asylum. The accommoda- tion provided in it, viz., 262, for both males and females, is quite inadequate for the lunatics among a population of over 34 millions, which, according to the last Census, number 2,992 males and 1,553 females. There is no accommo- dation here for Europeans and both criminal and non-criminal lunatics are accommodated together, which is obviously undesirable. European lunatics are sent to the Bhawanipur Asylum in Calcutta. 3. For the improvement of the Patna Lunatic Asylum it was never pre- viously considered advisable in Bengal to spend any large amounts specially in view of the proposed construction of a Central Asylum for Indian insanes at Ranchi. But for the reasons stated before, the case is very different now, and projects for urgent improvements have already received the considera- tion of Government. During the year under report the workshed of the Asylum was reconstructed. The roofs of the Superintendent's office and of the outside sleeping barracks were renewed. The quarters for the Sub- Assistant Surgeon attached to the institution are under reconstruction. Ad- ministrative approval of Government has also been accorded to the construc- tion of a new sleeping ward for 40 non-criminal lunatics at a cost of Rs. 5,673, and the Public Works Department has been asked to take up the work as soon as possible. Besides these, many other minor improvements were carried out during the past year. The provision of a female hospital, a ward for phthisical patients, quarters for warders and a cooling tank for drinking water is now under contemplation. It is also proposed to carry out certain special repairs to the Asylum building and to remodel its doors and windows at a total estimated cost of Rs. 10,042 during the current year. It will be still
2 some years before the proposed Ranchi Central Asylum can be made ready for occupation. In the meantime the pressing needs of the Asylum will have to be attended to. 4. Lieutenant-Colonel C. E. Sunder, I.M.S., was in charge of the Asylum throughout the year under review. The superior staff is reported to have worked well. One of the disadvantages in the Asylum management is the want of good and reliable men to serve as attendants. The pay of an ordinary male attendant is Rs. 7 per mensem and that of Jamadars Rs. 10 per mensem. As the work in a Lunatic Asylum is unpopular, these low rates of pay do not attract a better class of men to serve as attendants. The pay of these appointments should, therefore, in my opinion be revised. I will ask the Superintendent to submit definite proposals on the subject and will submit the same for the consideration of Government. 5. There was an increase of 22 lunatics in the total population of the Asy- lum in 1912. As this is the only Asylum in this Province, it is expected that the increase will be more marked in the current year. The Superintendent remarks that the popular prejudice against Lunatic Asylum treatment is fast wearing away. 6. There was a slight increase in the mortality at the asylum during the year under report being 26 against 21 in 1911; the percentage on the daily average strength being 10.56 against 9.12 in 1911. This is attributed to the fact that a large number of the patients admitted were in a bad state of health. 7. The total expenditure for the maintenance of the Asylum including charges on all accounts amounted to Rs. 27,553, the average cost per head being Rs. 11-13-10 against Rs. 107-12-10 in 1911. The amount realised from paying patients showed an increase of Rs. 121, which is satisfactory. Deducting these receipts which were credited to Government the cost per lunatic was Rs. 110-14-9 against Rs. 107-5-1. The falling off in the receipts from manufactures is due to the fact that one of the worksheds was under reconstruction during the year under review. 8. It was decided some years ago that a Central Asylum for European lunatics for Northern India should be established at Ranchi. A site for its location has already been selected. The Government of India accorded admi- nistrative approval to the scheme and have undertaken to provide the initial cost roughly estimated at Rs. 13,12,688. The Asylum will be under the direct control of this Government, but the recurring charges for its up-keep would be shared by the provinces sending their lunatics to it. Detailed plans and estimates of cost of the project are now being prepared by the Public Works Department of this Government. It has been decided that there will be accommodation in the Asylum for 180 lunatics3 12. I inspected the Asylum on the 12th May 1912, and am glad to be able to report that I found that the arrangements for drinking water, cooking, bathing and conservancy were all very satisfactory. The lunatics were well cared for. Due attention was also paid to their diet and clothing and varied amusements were provided to keep them cheerful. The management of the institution reflects credit on Lieutenant-Colonel C. E. Sunder, I.M.S., the Superintendent. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, F. J.

No. 2953-2R2 4. A further improvement carried out in the asylum during the past year was the revision of the establishment attached to it. Increased rates of pay were sanctioned to the existing jamadars, male and female warders, cook, malis and male and females sweepers. The following new establishment on pay noted against each was also sanctioned :3 United Provinces, Bengal, Assam and Burma during the year under report was respectively 6.67, 14.35, 7.7, 11.42, 8.15, 8.57, 9.47 and 16.5.

No. 4486. FROM COLONEL F. J. DRURY, M.B., I.M.S., INSPECTOR-GENERAL OF CIVIL HOSPITALS, BIHAR AND ORISSA, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BIHAR AND ORISSA, MUNICIPAL (MEDICAL) DEPARTMENT. Dated Ranchi, the 8th May 1915. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit herewith the first Triennial Report on the working of the Patna Lunatic Asylum for the period from 1912 to 1914 written by Lieutenant-Colonel C. E. Sunder, M.D., I.M.S., Superintendent of that institution, together with the usual statistical returns. 2. The Superintendent's report is self-contained, full and complete, but the following general remarks are made thereon :2 suffering from Tubercle of the lung showed an increase of 8 in 1914, the figures being 13 in 1914, 5 in 1913 and 9 in 1912. The ward for Tuberculosis patients sanctioned by Government with a view to segregate and treat them on modern methods is under construction. The total mortality was less in 1914 as compared with the previous year, the death-rate being 13.86 against 14.90. Excluding the one death from injuries referred to by the Superintendent the death-rate was 13.51 in 1914. The death-rates in 1914 in the asylums in the other Provinces were:3 arrangements for drinking water, cooking, bathing and conservancy are all very satisfactory. The asylum garden is well looked after and yields a plentiful supply of good vegetables for the use of the lunatics. The establishment of the asylum also worked as well as could be expected under the circumstances. 10. The new Indian Lunacy Act was introduced during the year 1912, and in 1913 all the districts of the Province of Bihar and Orissa, including the district of Angul, were declared to be areas in which reception orders may be made under the provisions of the Act. The Bengal Lunatic Asylum Manual, which is followed in this Province, has been revised by Lieutenant- Colonel C. E. Sunder, M.D., I.M.S., in accordance with the new Act and to suit the requirements of this Province. The draft manual is under revision in this office and will be submitted shortly for the approval of Government. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient Servant, F.J. DRURY, M.B, COL., I.M.S., Inspector- General of Civil Hospitals, Bihar and Orissa.
TRIENNIAL REPORT ON THE PATNA LUNATIC ASYLUM FOR THE YEARS 1912, 1913 AND 1914. 1. THIS is the first Triennial Report on the working of the Patna Lunatic Asylum, embracing the years 1912, 1913 and 1914. 2. Statement I2 During each of the years of the triennium under review there was some difficulty as regards accommodation for criminal males. The overcrowding prior to the construction of a new ward in 1913 was relieved to a certain extent by keeping a portion of the criminals in the non-criminal part of the asylum at night, as in the previous three years, vide letter No. 2778D., dated the 8th October 1909, of the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Bengal. After the completion of the new ward it was devoted to the use of criminals solely. Thus the capacity for male criminals was raised from 50 to 90. The accommodation for criminal males is still insufficient as their daily average keeps increasing, but no ill-effect resulted from the location of the latter sort at night in the non- criminal verandahs. During the day the lunatics are about the asylum grounds except in special cases. 7. Sickness and mortality.3 Pneumonia gave 3 admissions in 1912, 1 in 1913 and 1 in 1914, with two, one and nil deaths respectively. Nine patients were admitted to hospital suffering from tubercle of lungs in 1912, 5 in 1913, and 13 (of whom 7 were found grossly affected on admission) in 1914. These cases were treated as far as possible by isolation and open air methods. Particular attention has also been paid to their diet. Tuberculin has also been used. No special reasons can be given for the occurrence of the disease in this asylum except that the insane are proved to be affected always. Fever gave 32 admissions in 1912, 39 in 1913 and 25 in 1914, of these 30 cases were cured in 1912, 39 in 1913 and 25 in 1914. It is satisfactory to note that there have been no deaths from it during the triennium. The deaths from Epilepsy were 2 in 1912, 2 in 1913 and 3 in 1914. There was one death from Kala-azar in 1914. No cases of small-pox or cholera were treated in this asylum during the three years under review. No diseases broke out in epidemic form. The number of deaths for 1913 includes 1 case of homicidal strangula- tion. If this death be excluded the rate of mortality will be 14.55 per cent. 8.

Escapes.6 Public Works charges amounted to Rs. 2,623-2-0 in 1912, Rs. 9,047-7-5 in 1913 and Rs. 13,479-12-0 in 1914. Special repairs and construction of a sleep- ing ward account for the increase in 1913. The large expenditure in 1914 was chiefly due to the reconstruction of a portion of the compound wall, providing of a new pump for the well and certain building improvements. Receipts from paying patients amounted to Rs 233 in 1912, Rs. 448 in 1913 and Rs. 300 in 1914. The increase in 1913 was caused mainly by the higher rate charged for maintenance whereas the decrease in 1914 was due to the fall- ing of in the number of paying patients. 17. Establishment7 Many improvements have been made and the asylum is better than it was but its inmates cannot be adequately watched and cared for until the need for an increased recurring charge on account of an adequate number of keepers is faced. At present we cannot have more than 15 keepers on duty at a time, that is, one warder for every 17 lunatics and it is impossible to watch the insanes adequately even with this number nor is it sound to employ half the keepers at a time as we are compelled to do during the day. The duties of these men strain them physically and it is not to be wondered that their patience is often exhausted. C. B. SUNDER, M.D., LT.-COL., I.M.S., The 10th April 1915.

No. 4171. FROM COLONEL G. J.H. BELL, C.I.E., M.B., I.M.S., INSPECTOR-GENERAL OF CIVIL HOSPITALS, BIHAR AND ORISSA, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BIHAR AND ORISSA, MUNICIPAL (MEDICAL) DEPARTMENT. Dated Ranchi, the 5th May 1916, SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit the accompanying notes on the working of the Patna Lunatic Asylum for the year 1915 by Lieutenant-Colonel C. E. Sunder, M.D., I.M.S., Superintendent of that institution, together with the prescribed statistical returns. The notes are full and explanatory. Only a few general remarks are made below. 2. The insufficiency of the accommodation in the Asylum felt during the years 19122 5. The gradual increase in expenditure from year to year requires no special explanation. It was mainly due to the increase in the number of luna- tics and to the construction of new buildings. It is satisfactory to note that both the receipts from the sale of articles manufactured at the Asylum, and from fees from the relatives of paying patients, increased during the year under report. 6. Lieutenant-Colonel C. E. Sunder, M.D., I.M.S., who was in charge of the Asylum throughout the year, managed the institution satisfactorily. The person- nel of the warder staff of the Asylum needs to be improved. Although the staff has been strengthened, there were three escapes from the Asylum during the year. Two of the escaped lunatics were male criminals. They have been recaptured and brought back to the Asylum. The third, a male non- criminal lunatic, is still at large. The warders through whose negligence the escapes took place have been adequately punished. Colonel Drury, who inspect- ed the Asylum once during the year, remarked on the subject as follows :NOTES ON THE WORKING OF THE PATNA LUNATIC ASYLUM FOR THE YEAR 1915. STATEMENT I. AT the commencement of the year there were 258 males and 44 females, or a total of 302 inmates under treatment in this Asylum. The numbers admit- ted during the year were 88 males and 6 females, the figures representing readmissions being 5 males. Those discharged numbered 47 males (including one case of escape) and 4 females, and the deaths were 36 males and 5 females. The net increase in the population was therefore 7 only, the males having increased by 10 and the females decreased by 3. Of those discharged 33 males and 4 females were cured; 7 males were made over to their friends in improved condition ; one case escaped and 6 were discharged otherwise from the Asylum. The percentage of those cured to the daily average strength was 11.73 and to admissions 37.37 against 8.66 and 26.04 respectively in the previous year. The capacity of the Asylum has been increased from 306 to 356 by the con- struction of a new sleeping ward for criminal males with 40 beds, as well as a night ward with 10 cells for females. The capacity for male criminal lunatics is still inadequate, but provision is to be made for another 40 criminal lunatics by the construction of a new ward with 40 beds, which project has already been administratively approved by the Local Government. Sickness and Mortality.2 STATEMENT II. Criminal Lunatics.3 The average cost per head was Rs. 199-10-3 as compared with Rs. 149-14-11 in 1914, an increase mainly due to building works, increased cost of diet and bedding and clothing. STATEMENT IX. The general conduct of the staff has been much the same. We are unable to secure good men of good caste and have, therefore, to cope with a good deal of shirking of duty among the keepers. The lunatics were employed in gardening, atta and dal-making, dari-weav- ing, carpentry and smith's work, etc. A weaving machine (Hatterslee's loom) was purchased in 1915. The net profit in 1915 was Rs. 1,758 against Rs, 1,655 in 1914. GENERAL REMARKS. Amusements of various kinds were provided throughout the year at a cost of Rs. 96. The system of rewarding hard-working and well-behaved lunatics was continued during the year under report. Newspapers and books were provided to literate lunatics. The infirm gang system was maintained with advantage to the weakly and debilitated patients. Prophylactics were issued to the lunatics during the unhealthy season of the year. Additional wards, both for males and females as well as a female hospital and a phthisical ward, have been constructed. Steps are being taken to provide a new ward for criminals with 40 beds. C. E.

No. 5091. FROM THE HON'BLE COLONEL G. J. H. BELL, C.I.E., M.B., I.M.S., INSPECTOR-GENERAL OF CIVIL HOSPITALS, BIHAR AND ORISSA, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BIHAR AND ORISSA, MUNICIPAL (MEDICAL) DEPARTMENT. Ranchi Secretariat, the 5th May, 1917. SIR, I have the honour to submit for the information of the Lieutenant- Governor in Council the prescribed statistical returns of the Patna Lunatic Asylum for the year 1916. They are sufficiently explained by the prefatory remarks of the Superintendent and any further notes on them would be of little use. 2. The high rate of mortality at the Asylum as compared with that at other Provincial Asylums was noticed last year by His Honour in Council and a full report on the probable causes with proposed measures for improve- ment was submitted by me in my letter No. 10357, dated the 8th November 1916, after a thorough inspection of the institution. The death-rate for the year under report shows some improvement as compared with that of the previous year. As a result of these inquiries, steps are being taken to attempt to improve, as far as practicable, the sanitary and conservancy arrangements as also other structural deficiencies, which are removable at a moderate cost. The establishment at Ranchi of the proposed Central Asylum for Indian Insanes from Bengal and Bihar and Orissa and the consequent abolition of the Patna institution must necessarily limit further avoidable expenditure on the latter. 3. The proposal for the appointment of a Civil Assistant Surgeon as Deputy Superintendent of the Asylum has recently been sanctioned by the Local Government. The scale of pay of the keeper staff has been substantially raised with effect from the 1st March 1917 and this with the introduction of a system of security deposit are measures calculated to increase their efficiency in future. It has been found difficult, or rather impossible, to check the practice of the Asylum staff of sweepers working simultaneously under assumed names for the local Municipality. This matter is one in which the co-operation of the Municipal Commissioners is essential. 4. The new Bihar and Orissa Lunatic Asylum Manual is now under the consideration of the Local Government. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient Servant, G. J. H. BELL, C.I.E., M.B., Colonel, I. M. S. Inspector- General of Civil Hospitals, Bihar and Orissa.

No. 8472-M. FROM THE HON'BLE MR. J. D. SIFTON, I.C.S., SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BIHAR AND ORISSA, MUNICIPAL DEPARTMENT, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, HOME DEPARTMENT Dated Ranchi, the 17th June 1918. SIR, I AM directed to submit for the information of the Government of India a copy of the Triennial Report on the working of the Lunatic Asylum at Patna for the years 1915,1916 and 1917, together with a copy of a Resolution recorded thereon by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient Servant, J. D. SIFTON, Secretary to Government.
No. 7494. FROM THE HON'BLE COLONEL G. J. H. BELL, C.I.E., M.B., I.M.S., INSPECTOR-GENERAL OF CIVIL HOSPITALS, BIHAR AND ORISSA, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BIHAR AND ORISSA, MUNICIPAL DEPARTMENT. Dated Ranchi-Secretariat, the 16th May 1918. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit, for the information of the Lieutenant- Governor in Council, the statistical returns of the Patna Lunatic Asylum for the year 1917 together with a report by the Superintendent on the working of the Asylum during the triennial period ending the 31st December 1917. The Superintendent's report is constructed on the usual recognized method and is sufficiently full for all practical purposes. 2. The noteworthy event of the period was the local audit of the accounts of the Asylum in 1917. The accounts of the Asylum had never been audited during its whole previous existence and the audit was carried out for the purpose of investigating certain irregularities committed by the overseer. The latter has fully indemnified Government against the losses and deficiencies discovered but is still on medical leave which has consequently delayed the departmental proceedings ordered to be taken against him. With the appoint- ment of a whole-time Deputy Superintendent and the attention already directed to the matter, the state of affairs may be expected to improve. 3. In my letter No. 1850, dated the 25th February 1918, I submitted, for budgetting purposes, a preliminary report of the cost of improving the Asylum. The scheme of improvements consists of three main itemsTRIENNIAL REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE PATNA LUNATIC ASYLUM FOR THE YEARS 1915, 1916 AND 1917. 1. THIS is the Second Triennial Report on the working of the Patna Lunatic Asylum, embracing the years 1915, 1916 and 1917. 2. Statement I.2 6. Accommodation .3 and sputum in all cases (old and new) proved the presence of worms in a large proportion. The excreta of 398 (old 3054 8. Statement II5 Idiocy.6 The cost of diet was the principal item of expenditure, viz., Rs. 26,027-6-0 in 1915, Rs. 13,722-9-6 in 1916 and Rs. 15,127-6-9 in 1917, the cost per head being Rs. 82-9-3, Rs. 44-7-10 and Rs. 50-14-0, respectively. The large increase in the year 1915 was mainly due to the fact that the cost of some food-stuffs purchased in 1914 was paid for in 1915 owing to late receipt of Government allotments. Another reason for the increase was the larger daily number of lunatics and higher rates of some food-stuffs. As there was a large stock of food-stuffs from previous year and the average strength was also less the expen- diture in the year 1916 was much less. In the year 1917 only such expenditure was allowed as could not reasonably be avoided. The cost of superintendence was Rs. 4,500 in 1915, Rs. 4,472-15-10 in 1916 and Rs. 5,868-3-8 in 1917. The appointment of an Assistant Surgeon as a whole-time Deputy Superintendent on grade pay and an allowance of Rs. 50 per month from May 1917 was chiefly responsible for the excess expenditure of Rs. 1,395-3-10 during the year 1917. The cost of establishment was Rs. 7,773-13-3 or Rs. 24 11-1 per head in 1915, Rs. 8,161-8-0 or Rs. 26-7-4 per head in 1916 and Rs. 9,243-12-6 or Rs. 30-14-6 per head in 1917. The increased expenditure of Rs. 387-10-9 in 1916 was due to annual increments of the staff and the appointment of 2 more male ward attendants and 5 more sweepers. The large expenditure of Rs. 1,082-4-6 in 1917 was chiefly due to enhancement of pay of the matron and keeper staff from March 1917 [vide Government of Bihar and Orissa, Munici- pal Department (Medical Branch), letter No. 4580-M. of 26th March 1917.] The cost of clothing and bedding amounted to Rs. 2,916-11-9 in 1915, Rs. 2,434-4-0 in 1916 and Rs. 3,174-8-0 in 1917. The increased expenditure in 1915 was due to the fact that the price of clothing and blankets purchased in 1914 was paid for in 1915. The decrease in 1916 was due to not having been paid the cost of blanket kurtas. The increased expenditure of Rs. 740-4-0 in the year 1917 was chiefly due to war prices of clothing. The total charges on account of Europe and bazar medicines were Rs. 723-8-0 in 1915, Rs. 750-8-0 in 1916 and Rs. 1,445-3-7 in 1917. The gradual increase of the price of medical stores during the years under review is chiefly attri- butable to the war. Local purchase of certain medicines to carry out the investigation of Ankylostoma was partly responsible for the increase during the year 1917. The total expenditure on account of contingencies was Rs. 5,487-2-2 in 1915, Rs. 2,240-11-8 in 1916 and Rs. 2,123-6-0 in 1917; the cost per head being Rs. 17-6-6, Rs. 7-4-3 and Rs. 7-1-7 respectively. The manufacture of cloth was started in the year 1915 when a Hatterslee's loom was purchased. Purchase of yarns and threads for the manufacture of durries and cloth, cost of repairs and maintenance of Asylum roads and culverts, and construction of some drains are also responsible for the increased expenditure in the year 1915. Only such expenditure as could not be avoided was allowed in 1916, hence the decrease. The stoppage of the manufacture of durries and cotton stuffs and wood work owing to high price of raw materials explains the decrease in the year 1917. For rates and taxes Rs. 136 was paid in the year 1915, Rs. 102 in the year 1916 and Rs. 996-6-0 in the year 1917. The decrease in the year 1916 was due to non-payment of house-tax for the quarter ending December 1916. The enormous increase during the year 1917 was due to the fact that the amount paid for rates and taxes rose from Rs. 34 to Rs. 86 in 1917 owing to revised municipal assessment of the buildings. Another reason for the increase was that formerly night-soil was trenched in the Asylum grounds but the available area for trenching night-soil being built over it is now removed in municipal carts for which the Municipality assessed Rs. 400 annually as latrine tax. Public Works charges amounted to Rs. 15,311-5-10 in 1915, Rs. 3,200-13-0 in 1916 and Rs. 3,057-4-0 in 1917. Construction of a male criminal ward with 40 beds, a female ward with 10 cells, a male tuberculosis ward, a
7 Female Hospital and a latrine for the keepers account for the large increase in the year 1915. In the year 1916 only a portion of the sleeping ward started in 1915 was completed and certain repairs were done. The construc- tion of a male criminal ward with 40 beds and annual repairs to Asylum buildings account for the Public Works charges in 1917. The feeding plat- form which was constructed by the Asylum in the year 1907 was taken on the books of the Public Works Department and " thorough repairs " done by them at a cost of Rs. 288. Receipt from paying patients amounted to Rs. 531-1-8 in 1915, Rs. 300 in 1916 and Rs. 335-5-4 in 1917. The increase in the year 1915 was due to more paying patients having been treated in that year. There was only 1 paying patient in the year 1916 and 3 in the year 1917. 17. Establishment.8 Sanitation.APPENDIX.

SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit, for the information of Government, the Annual Statistical Returns of the two Lunatic Asylums in the Province of Bihar and Orissa for the year 1918 with the following short comments on them :2 patients whose friends expect something better by way of superior accommoda- tion. The accommodation in this asylum will have to be increased soon as the number of patients on the male side has already reached the limit. There was no overcrowding but the population was sometimes at its full capacity in the male section. The capacity of the Patna Lunatic Asylum is now 396 (for males 330 and for females 66). The accommodation in this asylum is now adequate and so there was no overcrowding. The difficulty arising from the smallness of the asylum area was met to some extent by sending the lunatics out to work during the day. Population.3 STATEMENT II. Criminal Lunatics4 the Public Works Department charges, was Rs. 133-2-8 a year against Rs. 127-6-6 in 1917. As the asylum at Ranchi was open for about eight months only, it is not possible to give a similar figure for this asylum. The manufacturing department at Patna was worked with a profit of Rs. 3,996 as compared with Rs. 2,177 in 1917. There is as yet no such depart- ment at the Ranchi Asylum but it is hoped something will be done in this direction in the near future. STATEMENT IX. Staff.STATEMENTS.

No. FROM LIEUT.-COL H. AUSTEN SMITH, C.I.E., M.B., B.C., I.M.S, OFFG. INSPECTOR-GENERAL OF CIVIL HOSPITALS, BIHAR AND ORISSA, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BIHAR AND ORISSA, MUNICIPAL (MEDICAL) DEPARTMENT. Dated Patna the April 1920. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit for the information of Government the Annual Statistical Returns of the Lunatic Asylums in the Province of Bihar and Orissa for the year 1919 with the following short comments on them. There were two lunatic asylums, viz., the Ranchi European Lunatic Asylum and the Patna Lunatic Asylum working in the Province during 1919. The Asylum for Indian Insanes at Ranchi has not yet been opened but the con- struction of buildings for the same is in progress and the question of staff for it is under consideration. STATEMENT I. Accommodation.2 At the beginning of the year there were 164 lunatics (91 males and 73 females) in the Ranchi European Lunatic Asylum. During the year 36 lunatics, 20 males and 16 females3 and re-admissions of this class of lunatics in the Patna Asylum was 26 males and 5 females and in the Ranchi Asylum was 3 males. At Patna 7 of these lunatics were transferred to the non-criminal list, 2 were sent for trial, 1 was removed to Jail, 10 were discharged, 1 was transferred to the Berhampore Lunatic Asylum and 1 escaped. Of the criminal lunatics at Ranchi, 2 were trans- ferred to Jails, 1 was transferred to the Yeravda Asylum to await his removal to England, and 1 was transferred to the non-criminal list. Two criminal lunatics who escaped from the Ranchi Asylum in 1918 were recaptured in the beginning of the year under notice, but they, after a few days of their residence in the Asylum, again made good their escape. They were, however, recaptured shortly after and shown under the head " Re-admitted." The persons responsible for the escape of lunatics both at Ranchi and Patna were suitably punished. There were 17 deaths among this class of lunatics in the Patna and 2 in the Ranchi Asylums respectively. The daily average strength of European Criminal Lunatics was 9.44 males and 2 females and of Indian criminal lunatics was 114.17 males and 14.01 females. The order of Government regarding the release of harmless lunatics convicted of trivial offences was strictly observed at the Patna Asylum. There was no such lunatic at Ranchi. STATEMENTS III, IV AND V. Religion, sex, residence, occupation and age.4 Insanity of Myx5 He is making a speciality of mental diseases under the tuition of Major Berkeley Hill and he will be an experienced officer by the time the Indian Asylum is opened. It is therefore advisable to keep him at the Ranchi Asylum in order to enable him to undergo a thorough training in this special work. I should also like to say a few words regarding the work of Mr. J. H. C. Peters who succeeded Dr. Jyotirmay Ray, as Deputy Superintendent. His work has been excellent and he is most reliable in all he does, taking a great interest in his duties. The subordinate staff at both the asylums are also reported to have performed their duties satisfactorily except in the case of European attendants at Ranchi who were not up to expectation. The number and pay of the staff at Ranchi European Lunatic Asylum are reported to be insufficient. The year under review witnessed constant changes in the person- nel of European attendants and one post of European attendant was vacant throughout the year. The time has come for a thorough revision of the establishment of this asylum. The question of revision of the establishment is under consideration. Six additional malekeepers were appoined at the Patna Lunatic Asylum. A Mistry was not employed in this asylum during the year. It is reported that it is impossible to retain either a blacksmith or a carpenter on the sanctioned pay of Rs. 12 and Rs. 16 respectively. GENERAL. Employment of lunatics.STATEMENT Nos.

No. 7743. FROM LIEUT.-COLONEL R. H. MADDOX, C. I. E., M. B., I. M. S., OFFICIATING INSPECTOR-GENERAL OF CIVIL HOSPITALS, BIHAR AND ORISSA, TO THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BIHAR AND ORISSA, MUNICIPAL (MEDICAL) DEPARTMENT. Dated Patna, the 23rd July, 1921. I HAVE the honour to submit for the information of Government the statistical returns of the Lunatic Asylums in this Province together with the following comments on the working of the Asylums during the triennial period ending the 31st December 1920. There were two Lunatic Asylums, viz., the Ranchi European Lunatic Asylum and the Patna Lunatic Asylum working in the Province during the period under review. THE RANCHI EUROPEAN LUNATIC ASYLUM. The Ranchi European Lunatic Asylum was opened on the 17th May 1918 with accommodation for 92 males and 88 females and during the triennium under report there was no over-crowding although sometimes the population exceeded the full capacity of the male section of the Asylum. Patients from Bengal, Bihar and Orissa, United Provinces, the Punjab, the Central Provinces, Berar and Assam and also from North-West Frontier Provinces and British Baluchistan are received at this Asylum. 2. Population.2 re-admissions. In the triennial period under review it may be said that mala- ria was responsible for most of the sickness. Apart from the outbreak of in- fluenza which did not develop to the intensity of an epidemic there was no epidemic during the triennial period under consideration. No patient of this Asylum received any serious injury and there was no accident among them during the triennium under report. The death rate per cent. calculated at the average number resident in the Asylum was 7.33 in 1920 against 9.45 in 1919 and 8.36 in 1918 when the Asylum was in operation for eight months only. In 1918, there were 3 deaths from Bright's disease, 2 each from pneumonia and cerebral hæmorrhage ; in 1919, 2 each from Status Epilepticus and phthisis Pulmunalis; and in 1920, 2 each from cancer and syncope. For the remaining deaths during the three years, each individual cause was responsible for each death. 4. Criminal Lunatics.3 One post of a Civil Assistant Surgeon has been added to the cadre of the medical staff of this institution, and the incumbent is now undergoing a course of training in Serology with special reference to the Wassermann test at the Calcutta Medical College. I should like to call attention to the fine work which Major O. A. R. Berkeley-Hill has performed at the Ranchi European Lunatic Asylum. He is one of the most experienced alienists in India and he uses his experience and sympathy for the great benefit of the patients in the Asylum. He has the wel- fare of his patients at heart. It is a pleasure to see him at work in the Asylum and his general keenness will be for the great benefit of the institution. I should also like to call attention to the excellent work of Mr. J. H. C. Peters, the Deputy Superintendent, who has been of the greatest assistance to Major Berkeley-Hill in the work of the Asylum. Doctor Jyotirmay Ray has also been a great assistance by his energy and keenness. He is now in Calcutta under- going an important course in Serology, as the correct performance of the Wasser- mann test is so important with regard to treatment and diognosis. During the triennium under review, the work done by the Subordinate Staff (European) was with a few exceptions, not altogether satisfactory owing to constant changes of personnel among them, and their replacement by others who wore new to the work. The Indian Staff on the whole, worked satisfac- torily although they have to be recruited from classes who were until quite recently aboriginal tribes. 9. Manufacture.4 The sanitary condition of the Asylum has much improved. Proposals for the improvement of the drainage system of the Asylum is under consi- deration. Arrangements are being made for holding Divine Services at the Asylum. During the triennium under review, the Asylum was visited by His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor, the Hon'ble Member in charge of Medical Department, the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Bihar and Orissa, four times, the Director-General of Indian Medical Service, the Sanitary Engineer, Bihar and Orissa, the Sanitary Commissioner, Bihar and Orissa, the Commissioner of the Chota Nagpur Division and the Secretary to the Govern- ment in the Municipal Department. The Asylum was also visited by the Com- mittee of the Calcutta Branch of the European Association. Improvements are constantly being made to this institution but there is still very much to be done to increase the comfort and well-being of the patients and to facilitate a scientific study of their diseases. THE PATNA LUNATIC ASYLUM. With the opening of a new sleeping barrack of 40 beds in 1918, the accom- modation at the Patna Lunatic Asylum was raised to 330 for males and 66 for females. The maximum number confined in one night was 265 males and 46 females. There was no overcrowding except for the space area which is only 9 acres and 16 poles inclusive of extramural land and quarters of the staff. There are no separate blocks for criminal and non-criminal lunatics and for paying patients and these classes of lunatics associate with one another. But as the buildings for the Asylum for Indian insanes which forms a part of the scheme for the establishment of both the European and Indiain Lunatic Asylums at Ranchi are now under construction, it is not desirable to make any additions and alterations to the Patna Lunatic Asylum. 2. Population.5 The population in a Lunatic Asylum have very little vitality in reserve to cope with any serious disease. The inmates of this Asylum were further weakened by chronic infection with intestinal parasites. The epidemics of Influenza of 1918 and 1919 acted still more in reducing their health. Though only two deaths in 1919 and three in 1920 in this Asylum were directly due to influenza, the disease hastened the deaths of those attacked with other diseases by destroying their resistive power. Lunatics are generally sent to the Asylum in their last stage and die shortly after admission. Various measures were taken to reduce the high rate of death with the result that the number of death fell down to 24 in 1920. 4. Criminal Lunatics6 Employment of Lunatics.STATEMENT Nos.

No. 6777. FROM COLONEL H. AUSTEN-SMITH, C.I.F., M.B., I.M.S., INSPECTOR-GENERAL OF CIVIL HOSPITALS, BIHAR AND ORISSA, To THE SECRETARY TO TH GOVERNMENT OF BIHAR AND ORISSA, LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT Dated Patna, the 30th June 1922. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit for the information of Government the statistical returns for 1921 of the Mental Hospitals, previously called lunatic asylums, in Bihar and Orissa together with the following comments on the working of these hospitals: 2 deaths and the remainder were due to Apoplexy, Debility and Anæmia, Syncope, Abscess of Brain, Influenza, Malaria (cerebral), Tuberculosis (intestinal), Oesophageal abscess and Septicæmia. The percentage of deaths to the average strength was 8.52 as against 7.33 in the previous year. The total number of recoveries during the year under report was 39 as compared with 32 in the previous year. The percentage of cures to daily average strength in this year was 25.57 as compared with 19.54 in the preced- ing year. The ratio per cent. of cases improved to daily average strength was 3.93 against 2.44 in 1920. CRIMINAL LUNATICS. One criminal lunatic was admitted during the year under report and the daily average strength of criminal insanes was 7.43 as compared with 11.10 in 1920. Only one criminal lunatic was discharged and one died during the year under review. TYPES OF INSANITY. The principal forms of insanity among the patients admitted during the year were, Alcoholic Insanity, Dementia Præcox, Confusional Insanity, Melancholia (agitated), Imbecility and Paranoia. CAUSES OF INSANITY. The most prolific ætiological factors and associated conditions of insanity among the patients admitted during the year under review were toxins of syphilis and alcohol which accounted for six cases. Other causes ascertainable were Heredity 1, Mental stress 2, Epilepsy 2, other defined Neurosis 1. The causes could not be ascertained in 37 cases. FINANCE. The total receipt under all heads amounted to Rs. 3,86,724 as compared with Rs. 2,90,644 in 1920. The amount realized from patients, was Rs. 27,920-0-0. Deducting the receipts from paying patients, the miscella- neous receipts and the Public Works Department charges, the net expendi- ture for the up-keep of the Hospital was Rs. 2,77,252. The total average annual cost per patient excluding Public Works Department charges was Rs. 1,817-13-0 against Rs. 1,471-1-10 in the previous year. The causes for the increase in the expenditure are, increase in the pay of staff, abnormal rise in the prices of foodstuffs of all descriptions, purchase of medicines and medical appliances which could not be obtained from Medical Store Depôt, Calcutta, in the pre- vious year, and of other articles of equipment for the Hospital and the up- keep of a Ford Char-a-banc and a Ford Ambulance. ESTABLISHMENT Major O. A. R. Berkeley Hill held charge of the Mental Hospital through out the year. I would again place on record the excellent and self-sacrificing work of Major O. A. R. Berkeley Hill among the patients. His know- ledge and care have been for the good of the patients and he is deservedly popular among them. He deserves every credit for the fine work he does among his patients and for his desire to push forward everything in connection with the Mental Hospital. He has nothing but praise for his loyal staff and I would call special attention to the good work of Mr. J. H. C. Peters, the Deputy Superintendent, and Doctor Jyotirmay Ray. There have been frequent changes during the year in the personnel of the European attendants and nurses but it is hoped that the recent increase of pay and the sanction of a mess allowance of Rs. 30 per mensem will attract a more intelligent staff and induce them to remain in their posts and so gradually gain experience. The Indian staff on the whole worked satisfactorily. Two patients were assaulted by inferior servants and these were suitably punished after an inquiry was held and the circumstances thoroughly investigated.
3 EMPLOYMENT AND AMUSEMENT OF PATIENTS. There is no manufacturing department in this Mental Hospital, but several Psychotherapeutic measures such as, Occupational Therapy, Psycho- therapy by Psycho-analysis, Hydrotherapy, Paroles, Amusements and Rewards were adopted during the year under review, for the treatment of patients and some of them hold out much hope of success. Games, concerts and picnics were held for the amusement of patients and a sum of Rs. 1,279-12-6 was spent under this head. A Library in the Male Section and another in the Female Section of the Mental Hospital have been properly organized. The former has 600 books and the latter 613 books. The Library in the Male Section is kept open twice daily from 10 A.M. to 12 noon, and from 5 P.M. to 9-30 P.M. while that in the Female Section remains open from 2 P.M. to 7 P.M. During this time books are issued to patients and entered in the Issue Registers provided for the purpose. The issue of books in each library is entrusted to a patient who is considered to be able to carry on this work. The patients have been classified into three groups, viz. (a) constant readers, (b) sporadic readers and (c) non-readers. The present number of patients in each of these groups are as follows :4 sion, the Deputy Commissioner, the Civil Surgeon and the Superintendent of Police, Ranchi. It was also visited by numerous sympathisers, European and Indian, of both sexes, PATNA MENTAL HOSPITAL. The Patna Mental Hospital is the only Institution for Indians in this Pro- vince and it provides accommodation for 330 male and 66 female patients. The proposed central asylum for Indians at Ranchi is still under construction. POPULATION. The number of patients at the commencement of the year was 254. Forty-nine males and 6 females were admitted and 7 males including 3 cases of re-capture were re-admitted. The daily average strength during the year under report was 220.38 males and 48.10 females or total 268.48. The maxi- mum number confined in one night was 225 males and 50 females. There was no over-crowding during the year under review. The total number of recoveries was 9 and the percentage of cure to daily average strength was 3.35 as compared with 6.79 in the previous year. The decrease is due to a small number of recoveries among the criminal lunatics, and to fewer admissions of military patients who were cured shortly after admission in the previous year. SICKNESS AND MORTALITY. 416 patients consisting of 339 males and 77 females were treated during the year for diseases other than mental. The daily average sick including epileptic cases was 57.50 as compared with 44.42 in the previous year. The increase is due to the inclusion of epileptic cases among hospital patients and the outbreak of Cholera in epidemic form. The number of patients admitted in bad or indifferent health was very high. There were 28 deaths among the patients during the year under review against 22 in the previous year. The percentage of deaths to daily average strength was 10.42 as compared with 8.79 in 1920. The increase is due to 6 deaths from Cholera. The chief causes of death were Cholera, Tuberculosis, Ankylostomiasis, exhaustion from acute Mania and Anæmia. Two of the patients committed suicide by hanging. This lowered mortality is due to the systematic treatment of Ankylostoma infection with Chenopodium Oil or Thymol, given for 9 consecutive weeks, after the last detection of Ova. A perusal of the following facts regarding the rate of Ankylostoma infec- tion of the population and death-rate is of interest :5 Tubercular patients were, whenever possible, kept in an open ward. Dysentry cases unless violent were segregated in a special ward, with the result that the disease was practically confined to the 9 old patients of last year. There were only 2 fresh cases this year. All patients were vaccinated or re- vaccinated against small-pox immediately after admission. Prophylactic use of quinine was successfully employed against Malaria. The wards were washed with a weak solution of lime water twice a week and with Phenyle on other days. This was found very useful in keeping off the flies and making the wards sweet. A criminal lunatic killed a keeper with a heavy padlock under the insane delusion that the inferior staff were conspiring to murder him. A pension of Rs. 8 per month for 12 years was awarded to the son of the murdered keeper. OBSERVATION CASES. The number of observation cases was 13. Of these 7 were certified insane and were admitted, 1 was certified but was released under section 14 of the Lunacy Act, and 3 were discharged uncertifiable. 2 remained till the end of the year. CRIMINAL LUNATICS. The year opened with 102 male and 15 female criminal lunatics and 17 male and 1 female criminal lunatics were admitted during the year. Three criminal males including 1 case of recapture of an escaped lunatic were re- admitted. The daily average strength of such lunatics was 101.96 males and 14.36 females against 105 males and 13.96 females in previous year. RELIGION, SEX, AND RESIDENCE, ETC. 45 Hindu, 9 Muhammadan and 2 Indian Christian males and 2 each of Hindu, Muhammadan and Indian Christian females were admitted. 28 males and 3 females belonged to Bihar proper, 9 males and 2 females to Chota Nagpur, 3 males only to Orissa, 1 male only to Bengal, 1 female only to the United Provinces and 1 male only to Madras. The residence of 14 males could not be ascertained. PREVIOUS OCCUPATION. Of those admitted 15 were cultivators, 9 were labourers, 4 beggars and 3 constables. In 13 cases the previous occupation was not known. AGE. Of the 62 admissions in the year 3 were aged less than 20, 39 between 20 to 40, 18 between 40 to 60, and 2 more than 60. TYPES OF INSANITY. The number of patients admitted under the four main types were errors of development 2, disorders of functions 85, result of infective tox6 FINANCE. The total expenditure exclusive of the amount received from paying patients, was Rs. 57,117-8-0 against Rs. 53,860-12-11 in 1920. There was increased expenditure under the head establishment owing to the revision of pay of the staff and of the employment of six temporary Keepers. The average cost per head exclusive of all Public Works Department charges was Rs. 202-9-9, as compared with Rs. 207-7-9 in the previous year. The total value of articles received from the manufacturing department exclusive of the cost of raw material was Rs. 3,096-9-5 against Rs. 1,664-5-2 in 1920. The increase is due to better supervision and to the fact that raw materials were purchased at a cheaper rate and so the profit was greater. ESTABLISHMENT. Lieutenant-Colonel C. E. Sunder, I.M.S., was Superintendent of the Patna Mental Hospital from the 1st January to the 31st March 1921. He was succeeded by Lieutenant-Colonel B. R. Chatterton who remained in charge till the end of the year. I should like to place on record the excellent work of Lieutenant- Colonel C. E. Sunder. He has always taken a great interest in the comfort of his patients . and has done all he could for their welfare and benefit. The work of Lieutenant-Colonel B. R. Chatterton too has been of the highest order. He has done all he could for the benefit of his patients and he is deserving of the greatest credit. I am glad to state that the pay of the deserving staff has been revised during the year. The conduct of the staff has been excellent throughout the year. GENERAL. The patients were well looked after and well fed. They were provided with extra clothing and diet when necessary. A sum of Rs. 95 was spent in providing for the amusement of the patients and books, newspapers and musical instruments were supplied for the patients in order to pass the time more pleasantly. The average number of patients employed in the manufacturing department was 129.69 and about 60 were employed in the general work of the Mental Hospital. Well-behaved and hard-working patients were rewarded with monthly stipends. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, H. AUSTEN SMITH, C.I.E., M.B., COL., I.M.S., Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Bihar and Orissa.

SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit, for the information of Government, the prescribed annual statistical returns of the Patna Mental Hospital together with Notes by Lieutenant-Colonel H. R. Dutton, I.M.S., on the working of that institution during the year 1922. The Superintendent's notes are full and explanatory and no further comments from me on the returns are, therefore, necessary. 2. One point, however, is worthy of notice here. Since the opening of the European Mental Hospital at Ranchi in the year 1918, the returns of this institution as well as those of the Patna Mental Hospital were dealt with in my office on their receipt from the Superintendents and printed and published together. But owing to the transfer, from the 1st July 1922, of the control and management of the Ranchi European Mental Hospital to the Board of Trustees appointed under the Ranchi Mental Hospital Act (Act No. XIII) of 1922, it has been decided by the Local Government that henceforth the report of the Ranchi European Mental Hospital should be submitted to them by the Managing Committee of the Board of Trustees and that of the Patna Mental Hospital should be dealt with in my office as was done before the opening of the Ranchi Mental Hospital. The returns of the Patna Mental Hospital only have, therefore, been dealt with in this report. 3. The construction of the buildings required in connection with the establishment of the Mental Hospital for Indian Insanes at Ranchi has been progressing rapidly and it is hoped that within a couple of years the Indian Mental Hospital will be an accomplished fact and ready for receiving the Indian Insanes who are at present confined in the Patna Mental Hospital in this province as also those residing in the Mental Hospitals in Bengal. I have the honour to be SIR, Your most obedient servant, H. AUSTEN-SMITH, C.I.E., K.H.S., M.B., Col., I.M.S., Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Bihar and Orissa.

No 3489/H-111-25. FROM THE INSPECTOR-GENERAL OF CIVIL HOSPITALS, BIHAR AND ORISSA, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BIHAR AND ORISSA, LOCAL SELF- GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT. Dated Patna, the 26th April 1925. SUBJECT :Notes on the working of the Patna Mental Hospital for the year 1924. Capacity.2 It is always a difficult problem to keep down the incidence of Ankylosto- miasis and Dysentery amongst the patients of a mental hospital, quite a considerable number of whom are of filthy habits, passing stools in wards, open paths or in the fields, drinking drain water, eating garbage and leaves and are also of coprophagic and geophagic habits. Want of a segregation ward has always been keenly felt but owing to the impending transfer of this hospital to Ranchi and general financial stringency construction of a new segregation ward could not be considered. Of 5 cases of Tuberculosis 3 were admitted with infection. There were 5 deaths against 20 in the previous year. The percentage of death to daily average strength (excluding cases under observation) was 1.71 against 7.31 in 1923. There was no case of death amongst the ' Observation ' cases. From available records it appears that the death-rate in 1924 has been the lowest since 1912. In 1924 the mortality in the Patna Jail was 23.94, in the Municipal area 23.97, and in this hospital 17.10, per mille. Criminal lunatics.3 Offence. Form of Insanity. Finding of the Court.

In this connection I would like to make a few observation in regard to " Criminal Lunatics ". Except in those cases where the accused persons are too insane to draw the attention of the trying Courts as to their mental condition, a plea of insanity is taken by the defence after some time has elapsed since the commitment of the crime, and the Court then directs the investigation of the mental condition of the accused. It becomes an extremely difficult problem for the medical men concerned to form any opinion at the stage as to whether or not the accused was of unsound mind at the time he committed the crime, and even if he was so whether his unsoundness of mind was of such a nature as to have negatived his criminal responsibility. There is a possibility of miscarriage of justice one way or the other in such cases. Or cases may occur where no such plea of insanity having been taken, and the mental disorder being of a trivial nature at the time of trial to escape attention of the Court, people have been convicted but while in prison under- going the sentence, they show unmistakable signs of such types of mental disorder which cannot but be of a long standing in nature. From the state- ment given above it will be noticed that amongst people convicted of crime
4 but later showing symptoms of insanity, 2 (Grievous hurt) suffer from Dementia Præcox, 1 (murder) suffers from Epilepsy and 1 (murder) suffers- from Dementia Paranoides. Now all will agree that the diseases men- tioned above are of very very long-standing in nature starting possibly from childhood. It becomes then a pertinent question to ask as to whether or not these crimes were the direct result of their diseases, and if so they should not have been convicted at all. Then again the question of ' malingering ' mostly among the convicts is a problem to be always kept in mind, the detection of which requires special observation and knowledge of mental disorders on the part of the prison authorities. It is not infrequently that cases of malingering have been mistaken for true insanity due to either want of special knowledge or intelligent observation or collusion of the convicts with the warders staff. To obviate the above-mentioned defects I would suggest that all prison doctors should undergo a thorough post-graduate training in a mental hospital, and that they should examine and record the mental condition of all prisoners, specially the under-trial prisoners, no matter whether a plea of insanity is taken or not. And in case of the latter, if they have reason to suspect any unsoundness of mind, they should voluntarily inform the trying courts their finding and opinion. Form of Insanity.5 for diet and payment of outstanding bills of the previous year for bedding and clothing. An amount of Rs. 1,403-9-0 was spent to purchase movable iron latrine seats (Durbar Pattern) to replace the bamboo baskets formerly in use for the purpose, thus improving the general sanitation of the hospital. The average annual cost per head excluding the Public Works Department charges was Rs. 259-13-7 against Rs. 211-11-7 in 1923. The Public Works Depart- ment charges per head in 1924 was Rs. 5-2-7 against Rs. 2-4-10 in 1923. Staff.APPENDIX.
