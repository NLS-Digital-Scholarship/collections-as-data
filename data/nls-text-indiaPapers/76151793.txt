The progress of the department has been maintained. Seven new dispensaries have been opened. The demand for Veterinary Assistants has exceeded the supply. In many instances, I have had to send senior students into the districts on temporary duty. 2. Table XXIV shows the strength of the Subordinate Veterinary Staff employed during the year; and Table XXI shows the number of animals treated by Veterinary Assistants in villages. There are fair grounds for the assumption that Veterinary Assistants do a certain amount of private practice both in the towns and districts about which they are reticent. 3. Each Dispensary has been inspected by the Subordinate Inspecting Staff in addition to my own visits. VETERINARY DISPENSARIES. 4. Howrah.( 2 ) professional aid of the Veterinary Assistant who informs me he has a good private practice. It is said that gratuitous assistance was given to the poor at their houses when asked for. The Dispensary was inspected by me. It is in a good order. 6. Sitamarhi( 3 ) I inspected the Dispensary which is a useful institution. 13. Patna.( 4 ) subscriptions now being raised, would not be sufficient for the maintenance of the Dispensary, had not Government made a grant of Rs. 30 per mensem on condition that the services of the Veterinary Assistant be utilised in the Damin i-koh Government estate, when needed. The Deputy Commissioner of the Sonthal Parganas hopes that the Institution will now get on, with the help of the Government grant. The subdivisional officers of the district, though they have failed to get subscribers to the Institution in their subdivisions, have promised to realise the actual expenses of the Veterinary Assistant when he treats cases within their jurisdictions. When I inspected the Dispensary, medicines and instruments were so deficient that it is open to doubt if a moderate number of cases could have been treated had they presented themselves. This establishment has been unfortunate. Soon after it was opened a rather bad outbreak of glanders necessitated the slaughter of a number of dâk ponies. This seems to have not only scared owners of animals but to have stopped subscriptions. The Veterinary Assistant who was in charge at the time was not very tactful and has since been transferred. I hope that matters have now taken a turn for the better. 22. Table XIX shows the number of animals treated at each Dispensary together with the receipts and expenditure of the several establishments. 23. Sripur.( 5 ) EXPERIMENTS AND INVESTIGATIONS. 30. Table XXIII shows that 12,829 head of cattle were immunised during the year against rinderpest. The other items given in this return are not reliable. In my opinion, many more than 557 animals died during these outbreaks, and it is not im- probable that a number of the 81 animals said to have died after they were immunised succumbed to some other disease. Had serum been available, more animals could have been treated. The operations were very successful in putting a stop to the spread of rinderpest. There was no friction between the operators and the owners of cattle, though of course many people refused to have their cattle treated. The Government of India recently decided that inoculation shall be taught at Muktesar, United Provinces of Agra and Oudh, in future. 31. Various other experiments were carried out. CATTLE FAIRS AND SHOWS. 32. I visited the Sonepore, Suri, and Barrahpore fairs, but could not visit the Kalimpong Fair as it clashed with Sonepore. The Kalimpong and Khagra fairs were visited by the Inspectors. I have resommendecl that the allotment of Rs. 250 for prizes for mules at Kalimpong shall cease. It has served its purpose and has no longer any effect upon the class or number of mules brought in. The money should be used to encourage mule-breeding at Buxar. The Sitamarhi Fair was not visited owing to a misunderstanding as to the date of the show. CATTLE-BEEEDING . 33. During the year bulls and cows were supplied to the ( 6 ) during the previous year as well as the year under report did not hold. The pony has now been disposed of, and it is hoped that the District Board will replace him by another soon. Table IX shows the cost of feed, keep, attend- ants, &c., of the stallion. 39.

No suitable candidate was available, during the year under report, to hold the "Sir John Woodburn Scholarship" founded by Syed Nawab Ali Chowdhury of Mymensingh. A Muhammadan candidate selected by the Magistrate of Mymensingh has joined the College recently. THE DISTRIBUTION OF PEIZES. 11. The distribution of diplomas and prizes took place on the 31st March, 1902. His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal kindly presided. Thanks are due to His Highness the Maharaja of Darbhanga, the Hon'ble Mr. J. B. Fuller, c.i.e., Mr. M. Finucane, c.s.i., Mr. C. G. H. Allen, i.c.s., Raja Sasi Shekhareswar Roy Bahadur, Dr. Kailas Chander Bose, Rai Bahadur, c.i.e., Raja Shew Bux Bagla Bahadur, Mr. A. F. M. Abdur Rahman, Khan Bahadur, and Maulvi Budruddin Haidar, Khan Bahadur, for their liberality in contributing to the Prize Fund. THE MUSEUM. 12. The Museum has been furnished with models and diagrams from Europe. They are of much use to the students for instruction purposes. THE INFIRMARY. 13. The total number of cases in 1901-1902 was 1,958 against 2,103 treated last year. Of these, 1,171 were in-patients and 787 out-patients against 895 and 1,208, respectively, in 1900-1901. (A.) The percentage of deaths was 3.21 against 7.98 last year. Four hundred and seventy-three operations were performed against 507 in 1900-1901. 14. A corrugated iron shed has been erected for the accommodation of animals admitted under the Act for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals with the sum of Rs. 1,000 subscribed by Seth Hardath Rai Chamria, and Rs.- 200 by the late Babu Tilak Chand Rathi. 15. The Belgachia garden has been fenced with plain wire, and guinea grass is being cultivated here on a larger scale, so as to reduce the cost of forage. 16. The number of horses shod at the forge in 1901-1902 was 433 against 315 in 1900-1901. FINANCIAL. 17. The fees for the treatment, shoeing, &c., amount to Rs. 11,621-12-9 against Rs. 7,666-9-3 in 1900-1901. They would have amounted to Rs. 11,783-8-9 had the fees for Government animals been charged. The cost of feeding was Rs. 7,889-8-8 against Rs. 8,715-2-7 in 1900-1901. There is a surplus of Rs. 3,891-0-1 of fees over the cost of feed against last year's surplus of Rs. 2,157-5-8. OUTSTANDING ACCOUNTS. 18. The sum of Rs. 54-14-0 shown in the last year's report as outstanding from two old defaulters has not yet been realised. Our recent debts amount to Rs 47-4-0, which are expected to be realised within a few days. 19. The statement showing the Provincial cost of the Department for the year 1901-1902 is appended (Table XVIII). THE HOSTEL. 20. Additional accommodation has been provided for messing, for want of which the students had to feel some inconvenience. The hostel building has been thoroughly repaired by the Public Works Department. INSTRUCTION TO OTHERS THAN VETERINAEY STUDENTS. 21. A course of 48 lectures on Veterinary Hygiene and cattle breeding and rearing was delivered to eight students of the agricultural class at the Civil Engineering College, Sibpur. 22. A class for the training of petty officers and drivers of the Supply and Transport Corps as dressers is opened, and 29 men are attending.
