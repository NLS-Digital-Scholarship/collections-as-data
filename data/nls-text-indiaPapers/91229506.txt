REPORT ON THE VACCINE OPERATIONS IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES FOR THE YEAR 1885-86. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] NAGPUR: PRINTED AT THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE PRESS. 1886.
No. 4982A/324 FROM F. C. ANDERSON, ESQ., C. S., OFFG. SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces. To THE DEPUTY SURGEON-GENERAL, Central Provinces. Dated Nagpur, the 2nd November 1886. SIR, I am directed to acknowledge your Report on Vaccination for the year 1885-86, which was received in print on the 22nd September last. Results generally unsatis- factory. 2. The results of the year, the Officiating Chief Commissioner regrets to observe, are generally unsatisfactory. The total number of operations was less than it has been for several years past, the cost of each successful case was higher than in the preceding year, and there has been a falling off in the amount of inspection work done. Work of the Provincial Vaccination staff. 3. The number of operations performed by the Provincial Vaccine Depart- ment during the past four years is shown below :2 able to the Civil Surgeon. Again, in Bhandara, although the present Civil Sur- geon took charge of his duties early in January, he inspected the work of the staff in 31 villages only. It is not, therefore, surprising to find it reported that the decrease in this district was due to &quot;want of energy on the part of the vaccina- tors.&quot; It seems hardly necessary to point out that the staff cannot be expected to be energetic, unless Civil Surgeons lead the way, and themselves take an in- terest in the work and exercise a close supervision over their subordinates. The Officiating Chief Commissioner trusts that Civil Surgeons will take note of these remarks and endeavour to regain this season the ground lost during the past year. The percentage of success for the Province as returned by both Civil Sur- geons and Native Superintendents is the same as in the previous year, viz. 92. The Civil Surgeon, Chanda, found the ratio of success upwards of 5 per cent higher than that claimed by the vaccinators, but no explanation of the matter is given, and I am to say that when an officer reports so unusual a result as this, the Officiating Chief Commissioner would have expected some sort of explanation of how it was arrived at. The cost of each successful case (by the Provincial staff) was 2 annas and ½ pie compared with 1 anna and 10¾ pies in the previous year. Work of the Provincial Dispensary staff. 4. There was a large decrease in the number of operations performed by Hospital Assistants in charge of dispensaries, which is suf- ficiently accounted for by the orders referred to in para- graph 32 of the Report. The percentage of success, it isobserved, is lower than that of last year in both primary and re-vaccinationoperations. Vaccination in the Feuda- tory States. 5. According to the table given in paragraph 24 of the Report, there was a considerable increase in the number of operations in the Feudatory States, but the increase is nominal, for the returns of the year under report include the figures for the Kala- handi and Patna States which did not find a place in last year's returns. In reality there has been a falling off in the amount of work done, which is to be regretted; and, in some States at all events, the work has been of poor quality, for your inspections in Nandgaon, Khairagarh and Kawardha satisfied you that it had undoubtedly not been satisfactory in those States. Two native Superintendents were appointed during the year to supervise vacci- nation in some of the Feudatory States and Zamindaris of the Chhattisgarh divi- sion, but it was late in the season before they got to work, and the amount of in- spection done by them was therefore comparatively small. Their appointment will, it is hoped, lead to better results this year. The Raja of Rehrakol is reported to be opposed to vaccination. The Raja of Bamra, on the other hand, appears to take as much interest in this as in other matters connected with the well-being of his State, and the Deputy Commis- sioner will doubtless endeavour to induce the Raja of Rehrakol to follow his good example. Mr. Fitzpatrick also observes that among the States in which work
3 has decreased there are two, viz., Sarangarh and Raigarh, which are under Go- vernment management, and he takes this opportunity of drawing the attention of the Deputy Commissioner of Sambalpur to the matter. No vaccination work was done by the Hospital Assistants in charge of the Dongargarh and Raj Nandgaon Feudatory Dispensaries, and the Officiating Chief Commissioner would be glad to know whether, if they have been inten- tionally relieved of this duty, proper arrangements have been made for carrying on vaccination in these two places. Small-pox. 6. The table in paragraph 40 of the Report is intended to give the order in which each district stands in the matter of protection from small-pox (when judged by the proportion of the population believed to have been successfully vaccinated in the past five years), as compared with the order of the district death rate from small-pox in 1885-86. But in the heading of the second column of figures in the table the words &quot; slightest&quot; and &quot;severest&quot; have evidently been transposed, No. 1 (Bhandara) representing the severest (not the slightest), and No. 18 (Hoshangabad) representing the slightest (not the severest) death rate from small-pox. It may be observed that the Civil Surgeon of Hoshangabad is of opinion that many cases of small-pox are not report- ed, and no positive conclusions can be drawn from statistics which are liable to error; but the figures as grouped in sets of three below would seem to warrant us in tracing a pretty distinct relation between the extent of protection believed to have been afforded and the death rate from small-pox.

4 From the report of the present Civil Surgeon of Nimar it appears that, owing to the continued efforts of the late Civil Surgeon, Dr. Cullen (now on leave), vacci- nation has become so wide-spread and is so generally accepted by the people of Nimar as a good thing, that &quot; small-pox has ceased to be an important factor in the mortality of the district&quot;. Reference is made in your Report (paragraph 57) to an apparently very useful system introduced by Dr. Cullen in Nimar of making a vaccination census in each village. The Officiating Chief Commissioner would be glad to have some further particulars regarding that system and to know whether its working is confined to Nimar, &c. Inspection. 7. The results are not satisfactory. Civil Surgeons inspected a smaller number of villages and a smaller number of cases than in the previous year ; Native Superintendents spent fewer days on tour and inspected fewer cases and fewer villages. The Civil Surgeons of Chhind- wara and Balaghat inspected the largest number of villages, while the Civil Surgeons of Nimar, Mandla and Damoh saw the largest percentage of cases. You were on tour in Chhindwara and Balaghat (among other districts) and report that the work you saw was with few exceptions good, which is satisfactory. Good work is pretty certain to be found where the Civil Surgeons have taken an active part in supervising their subordinates. In Sambalpur, where there was little or no inspection work done, grave irre- gularities, which have been separately brought to the Chief Commissioner's notice, were discovered. The Civil Surgeon was tied down to head-quarters for a portion of the season by having medical charge of the Wing of the Regiment at Sambal- pur ; the inconvenience thus caused has, as you are aware, been referred to in recent correspondence with the Government of India. The unequal amount of work done by the Native Superintendents in theseveral districts is very striking, and the Officiating Chief Commissioner truststhat efforts will be made to bring them all up to a higher level of general efficiency,some standard of work being set, below which they must on no account be allowedto fall. Quality of work. 8. In paragraph 51 of the Report you notice that you saw enough on tour to convince you that vaccinators are not sufficiently careful in the selection of the lymph they use on the children theyvaccinate. The Officiating Chief Commissioner would be glad to have somefurther explanation of your meaning. Attitude of the people towards vaccination. 9. The attitude of the people towards vaccination is chiefly one of indif- ference, but it would seem that, as a rule, there is no great difficulty in persuading them to let their children be vacci- nated. There are, moreover, certain exclusive classes, who do all they can to avoid having their children vaccinated, and with these classes time and patience are necessary. Here and there persons are met who have learned to appreciate the immunity from small-pox which is afforded by success- ful vaccination, and who willingly assist the authorities. The Civil Surgeon of Nimar names three malguzars who have rendered him such assistance, and the
5 Officiating Chief Commissioner desires that the Deputy Commissioner will remember, when an opportunity presents itself, to thank them for their aid. He would also be glad if Civil Surgeons would always bring such services to notice in their annual reports, so that they may be publicly acknowledged. Conclusion. 10. In thanking you, in conclusion, for your Report, I am again to express the Officiating Chief Commissioner's regret that the results of the year are so unfavourable. In many cases the vac- cinators are reported to have done bad work, and in some districts the work of the Native Superintendents has been much below the mark. Results generally have been unsatisfactory, and I am to say that it will require the closest super- vision from Civil Surgeons and from yourself to recover the ground which has been lost. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, F. C. ANDERSON, Offg. Secretary.
Report on Vaccination in the Central Provinces during the year 1885-86. 1. In this report the operations in the Province (including Zamindaries) are shown separately from those in Feudatory States. 2. No work was carried out in 6 of the Zamindaries of the Raipur district during the year under review. 3. The following table shows the work done by each of the 4 vaccinating agencies, as also the grand total of operations performed in the Province including Feudatory States in the past and the previous year. Table I.2 The decrease occurred in the work of all the agencies except that of the Feudatory State Vaccine Department, and the greatest falling off took place in the work by Dispensary Hospital Assistants, both Provincial and Feudatory State. 5. The ratio of success is for the two last years :3 The decrease in primary operations was confined to the work of the Pro- vincial department, while the increase in the re-vaccination cases occurred in both the Provincial and Feudatory State Departments. 9. The number of Vaccinators was increased by 16, the increase being confined to the Feudatory State Department. 10. With a large decrease in the number of operations and a large increase in the number of operators there was of necessity a diminution in the average number of persons vaccinated by each Vaccinator, and it reached the high figure of 234. 11. The total cost of the 2 Departments was considerably larger than in the previous year, the increased cost being due chiefly to the larger staff employed and also to the vaccinating instruments being shown (in contin- gencies) this year for the first time. The average cost of each successful operation by the whole Vaccine Department was Rs. 0-0-2½ more than in the previous year. In calculating the cost of each successful operation by the Provincial Department one-third of the Sanitary Commissioner's salary is included; but if (to give a fair comparison) we exclude this, we find the cost to be by Provin- cial Department Rs. 0-1-8 and by Feudatory State Department Rs. 0-1-7. DISPENSARY VACCINATION. (Provincial and Feudatory State ). 12. A comparison of the work done in the two past seasons is given below:4 PROVINCIAL VACCINE DEPARTMENT. 15. The chief facts connected with the working of this department in the 2 past years are as below :5 years, on whom the operation had not been repeated up to the time of his inspection. The decrease in the Jubbulpore district is assigned by the Civil Surgeon to less work having been done by the old Vaccinators and to 4 of the staff being new, and especially to the loss by death of one of the best men. The Civil Surgeon of Seoni attributes the decrease to the great mortality that took place in the district, and he shows that the number of primary opera- tions exceeded the number of infants calculated to be available. The Civil Surgeon, Mandla, says that the decrease is &quot; owing to the adults &quot; having been nearly all vaccinated and only children left ;&quot; but as he does not give any information as to the number of children available it is impossible to say if this explanation is correct. As regards the other districts in which the decrease exceeded 1,000, in Chhindwara the decrease is accounted for partly by one Vaccinator having done very little work and partly by the heavy mortality that occurred during the year. The decrease in Bhandara appears due to the Vaccinators having failed to work as they should have done. No reason is assigned by the Civil Surgeons of Bilaspur and Sambalpur for the smaller number of operations. 19. The total number of re-vaccination operations for the Province is 769 more than it was in the previous year. The increase was greatest in Mandla (1,772), Hoshangabad (983) and Nimar (278). The Civil Surgeon, Mandla, says that of the 1,772 re-vaccination operations 1,717 or 96.9 per cent were successful, which makes it doubtful if the operations were not cases of repeated vaccination or operations on adults. The Civil Surgeon, Hoshangabad, states that the greater part of the persons re-vaccinated were children of from 3 to 9 years of age, and that he cannot recollect having seen a single adult who had been re-vaccinated. If a child of three years of age had been successfully and sufficiently vaccinated in infancy, its re-vaccination was unnecessary, and therefore objec- tionable as tending to make vaccination unpopular : but it is a good instance of the difficulties met with in carrying out work by a half educated class of men like Vaccinators. Special instructions had been given by the Civil Surgeon that re-vaccina- tion should be promoted as far as possible, and so the Vaccinators finding they could most easily get the small children operated on them. In Nimar the Civil Surgeon found at the commencement of the season that the Vaccinators were ignorant of the real meaning of the term &quot; re-vacci- nation&quot; and that as a consequence the classification was not correct ; but this was rectified, and the percentage of success (32.67) would indicate that most of the cases were correctly returned. There is a decrease of 1,622 in the number of re-vaccination operations in Betul, but, as stated in last year's report, the term was in former years applied
6 to repeated operations, and the decrease is really due to classification being properly carried out this year. 20. The total number of Vaccinators employed has remained the same : but in the Narsinghpur and in the Seoni districts a Vaccinator was employed specially for the Municipal towns to relieve the Hospital Assistants of the work, while in the Raipur district the number employed in the zamindaries was two less than in the previous year. Grave irregularities in the way of levying fees by the Vaccinators having been discovered at the commencement of the season in the Sambalpur district, the Native Superintendent was suspended, and at its close a Hospital Assistant was deputed to inspect the work : two Vaccinators were tried by the Magis- trate and punished with rigorous imprisonment for 12 months. 21. The average number of operations performed by each Vaccinator is 170 lower than in the previous year and reaches 2,000 in only 5 districts, viz. Chhindwara (2,376), Balaghat (2,208), Sambalpur (2,047), Wardha (2,032), Mandla (2,007). The number is lowest in Betul (1,177), Seoni (1,369) and Narsinghpur (1,433). The greatest falling off in the work of each-Vaccinator as compared with that of the previous year took place in the districts of Seoni (796), Jubbul- pore (454), Raipur (315), Betul (291), Mandla (254), and Chhindwara (233). 22. The percentages of success are as returned by7 The very much lower percentage of success returned by the Civil Surgeon than that claimed by the Vaccinators of the Nimar district is due to the more thorough and more educated inspection of the former. 23. The small difference in the pay of Establishment is due to changes in the grades of the men employed. The amount entered under the head of travelling allowance does not include that of the Assistant to the Civil Surgeon, Nagpur, which was not drawn up to the close of the year. The increase in the cost of Contingencies is due to that of instruments being included this year, it having been met from District Funds instead of having been adjusted as in former years by the Comptroller from Provincial Funds. Each successful operation cost rather more than in the previous year, the highest rate being Rs. 0-2-8 in the Seoni district, and the lowest (Rs. 0-1-0) in that of Sambalpur. The smaller number of operations performed accounts for the increased average cost of each successful case in the Province, and the suspension of the Native Superintendent accounts for the average cost being so low in the Sam- balpur district. FEUDATORY STATE VACCINE DEPARTMENT. 24. The work of this Department is shown below :8 26. The suspension of work in the Chuikhadan State was due to trained Vaccinators not having been available, and the Civil Surgeon, Raipur, points out (rightly I believe) that it is difficult to get trained men to serve in this State and some of the zamindaries as they receive pay only during the work- ing season. 27. If we exclude the work in the Chuikhadan, Kalahandi and Patna States from the figures for the two past years, there is a decrease in the total number of operations of 7,442. The decrease has occurred in the work of the Vaccinators of the follow- ing States:9 These appointments will undoubtedly, if the Superintendents work properly, do much to improve the vaccination in the States and Zamindaris : but much still remains to be effected in the arrangements for carrying on the work. PROVINCIAL DISPENSARY VACCINATION. 31. The following is the work done by the Hospital Assistants in the Province during the past two years. 1884-85. 1885-86. Difference in 1885-86. Total number of operations 10 shall be regarded as part of the duty of every Hospital Assistant in charge of a Dispensary, except in cases where the Deputy Surgeon General declares' it to be otherwise. The very large decrease in the number of operations by the Hospital Assis- tant in charge of the Seoni-Malwa dispensary is due to his circle having been confined to municipal limits, whereas in former years he vaccinated in villages as far away from his dispensary as 7 or 8 miles and included in the vaccination circles. The Civil Surgeon does not afford any explanation of the large falling off in the number of operations by the Dhamtari dispensary Hospital Assistant; but from what I saw there this year, I am quite sure that the dispensary work suffered from the absence of the Hospital Assistant while vaccinating. I suspect also that many of the operations in former years were performed by others than the Hospital Assistant. 33. Jubbulpore and Chhindwara are again the only districts in which the Hospital Assistants performed re-vaccination to any extent. 34.The percentage of success is lower than that of last year in both pri- mary and re-vaccination operations and it is in both cases considerably lower than that claimed by vaccinators. 35.

12 FEUDATORY STATE DISPENSARY VACCINATION. 36. The work by the Hospital Assistants in charge of these institutions during the past 2 seasons is as follows :13 39. In the Nagpur and Wardha districts there appears to be very deci- ded passive resistance to vaccination on the part of the people in many vil- lages. In Chanda the work of the vaccinators is reported as not satisfactory. The Civil Surgeon, Mandla, attributes the prevalence of the disease to non- protection of the people from an insufficient staff of vaccinators. 40. With a view to trace what relation exists between the state of protec- tion by vaccination and the prevalence of small-pox, I have in the table printed below placed opposite each district of the Province the position it occupies (1) according to the state of protection enjoyed by the people as judged by the proportion of the population said to have been successfully vaccinated in the previous 5 years, and (2) according to the death rate from small-pox in 1885-86. District. Position in scale of protection No. 1 worst No. 18 best protected districts, Position in seale of small-pox death rate No 1 sightest, No. 18 severest death rate.

In the case of the districts of Wardha and Mandla the high position they occupy both as to protection and small-pox mortality indicates that either the vaccine operations returned as successful are really not so, or that while a large part of the population is well protected parts of the district escape vaccination altogether, and the reports of the Civil Surgeons of these districts show that parts of the districts do escape vaccination, in the Wardha district, because of the oppssition of the people in towns and large villages and in the Mandla dis- trict, because the vaccination staff is so small that only half of each circle can be worked over during the year. But from what I saw of the work in this dis-
14 trict, I am inclined to think that the amount of protection claimed may be higher than it really is from doubtful and unsuccessful operations being returned as successful. On the other hand, the low position as regards protection and the low small- pox mortality of the districts of Raipur, Hoshangabad and Jubbulpore excite suspicion that deaths from small-pox are not reported. And the Civil Surgeon, Hoshangabad, has found that cases of small-pox in the Head-quarter town have not been reported and strongly suspects that the same is the case in the district. Regarding Raipur and Jubbulpore I have not any information. Inspection Table. District No. of days out on tour No of villages inspected. No. of vacci- nated persons inspected.

15 41. The inspection in the district of Nagpur was carried out by the Assis- tant to the Civil Surgeon and that in the Jubbulpore district by an Assistant Surgeon specially deputed for this work. 42. In his Review of the Report on the Vaccine operations in the Central Provinces for the year 1884-85 the Chief Commissioner laid down that not less than about one month or more than 6 weeks is ordinarily a suitable period for the Civil Surgeon to be on tour. 43. The only Civil Surgeons who spent much less than a month on tour are those of Bhandara, Saugor and Sambalpur. There was a change of Civil Surgeon at Bhandara during the inspection season which no doubt partly offers a satisfactory explanation of the very short period spent in camp, but as the present Civil Surgeon took charge early in January I think he should have done much more inspection work. The short period spent by the Civil Surgeon, Sambalpur, on tour is accounted for by his having been placed in medical charge of the wing of the Regiment in the early part of the season and by illness later on. It is particularly unfortunate that he was able to do so little inspection work, as last year the Civil Surgeon was on tour only 9 days, while the suspen- sion of the Native Superintendent and the detection of grave irregularities by Vaccinators made it especially desirable that the Civil Surgeon should have seen as much of the work as possible. Of the 23 days spent on tour 9 were devoted to inspection of the work in the Rerakole Feudatory State in which there is only 1 vaccinator. The Civil Surgeon, Hoshangabad, was detained in the station by work at the dispensary. Mr. Thipthorpe, Civil Surgeon, Wardha, had to return from the district on account of a case of serious illness and to give evidence in Court. The Civil Surgeon, Raipur, met with an accident which prevented his being out for long in March. The number of days entered as spent on tour by the Civil Surgeons, Nar- singhpur and Balaghat, and by the Assistant Surgeon at Jubbulpore include those devoted to the special inspection of the sanitary state of villagas in which cholera had appeared. 44. The Civil Surgeon, Sambalpur, visited on an average less than two villages, and the Civil Surgeons, Bhandara and Chanda, less than 3 villages, each of the days they were on tour. The number of villages visited by the Civil Surgeons of Hoshangabad and Wardha was also small. 45. The Civil Surgeon of Sambalpur saw only 0.9 per cent of the persons vaccinated by the district staff or practically none, and the percentage seen by the Civil Surgeons, Bhandara, Chanda, Hoshangabad, Raipur and Bilaspur are smaller than is desirable: but in the cases of Raipur and Bilaspur the total number of vaccinated persons inspected by the Civil Surgeon is not small, the small proportion seen being due to the large number of Vaccine operations performed in those districts.
16 The area of these 2 districts and the vaccination staff employed in them are so large that for the proper inspection of the work the Civil Surgeons should be on tour during a longer period than is necessary in other districts. The Civil Surgeons, Nimar and Mandla, saw nearly half of the total number of persons vaccinated. 46. The proportion of vaccinated persons inspected by the Native Super- intendents of Chanda, Betul and Nagpur is very low. The Native Superintendent of Nimar saw nearly all the vaccinated persons as already noticed. 47. The Civil Surgeons and Native Superintendents return the same ratio of successful cases for the Province, and their percentage (92) is practically the same as it was last year; the ratio returned by vaccinators is 1 per cent lower than it was in the previous year. 48. The inspection, by Native Superintendents, of the Vaccinators' work in the Feudatory States and Zamindaries of the Raipur, Bilaspur and part of the Sambalpur districts was on a more satisfactory footing in the year under report than in any previous year, as 2 Native Superintendents were (as sanctioned by the Chief Commissioner in his letter No. 4499-224 of 21st November 1885) appointed specially for this work; but as these men did not join their appoint- ments till the end of January and beginning of February and were new, in great part, to their districts, the amount of inspection done by them is compa- ratively small. 49. I had an opportunity of seeing the work in the Nandgaon, Khaira- garh and Kawardha States and in the Pandaria Zamindari during the past working season, and there can be no doubt that it was not and has not been satisfactory. I also saw a considerable number of vaccine operations in the Betul, Chhindwara, Balaghat, Raipur, Bilaspur and Mandla districts. I did not find the names of unvaccinated persons entered as vaccinated in any village forms. In several of the circles in the Raipur district the village forms had not been given to the Kotwar, the names of the persons vaccinated had not been entered, and in many the vaccinators had not re-visited the villa- ges to record the results. The work of the previous, as well as the present year, I also found in several instances bad, and altogether my inspection of the work in this district led me to the conclusion that the vaccinators were badly super- vised and had been so for some years, and thus allowed to get into a careless unsatisfactory way of doing their work both clerical and vaccination. I saw some indifferent and bad work in the Bilaspur district also. No doubt these two districts with the Zamindaries and some of the Feudatory States have hitherto been more than 1 Native Superintendent could thoroughly supervise, but this is not a sufficient excuse for the state of the work in the Raipur district. In Chhindwara and Balaghat the work I saw was with few exceptions good.
17 In Betul I saw comparatively few vaccinated persons, but in several villa- ges the forms were not to be found. 50. The high ratio of success returned by vaccinators is due to (1) doubtful cases being entered as successful, (2) the repetition of the operation on persons already unsuccessfully operated on without recording any result till a success- ful one is found. 51. I also saw enough to convince me that vaccinators are not sufficiently careful in the selection of the lymph they use or in the children they vaccinate. DISTRICT VACCINATION. The following is a precis of the reports submitted by Civil Surgeons:18 lymph proved unsuccessful. 3 Vaccinators were employed on cholera duty at the beginning of the season so that they did not begin vaccinating till the 8th, 20th and 22nd November respectively: notwithstanding this there was an increase of 106 in the number of operations. The ratio of success returned by the vaccinators is lower than it was last year, the difference being due to more accurate recording of results. The Civil Surgeon was 40 days on tour and found the percentage of success to be 83.72. No falsification of the returns was detected. The Native Superintendent was 143 days on tour and inspected 7,817 children. The Civil Surgeon reports that he was not as energetic as he should have been. The attitude of the people in general is one of indifference, the higher and more wealthy still showing some opposition. DISPENSARY VACCINATION. The Hospital Assistants did more work than in any previous year: the increase took place at all the dispensaries, but was most marked at the main dispensary. The vaccination by the Hospital Assistants at Damoh and Hatta is to be confined to the limits of the Municipal town. SMALL-POX. There were 665 cases as compared with 1,113 in the previous year; but the Civil Surgeon found on personal inspection that cases of chicken-pox are reported as those of small-pox. 54. Jubbulpore.19 DISPENSARY VACCINATION. The number of operations performed by Hospital Assistants is 1,330 less than that of the previous season. This is, the Civil Surgeon thinks, partly due to the areas of the Murwara and Sehora Hospital Assistants' work having been reduced and partly to the Hospital Assistants not considering vaccination so distinctly a part of their work. The Medical Officer of the city branch took leave and those of the Main and Sehora dispensaries were changed. The falling off may be partly due to this. SMALL-POX. Only 3 deaths were reported as having occurred from this disease, and the Assistant Surgeon could not in any of the villages hear of a vaccinated child having died of the disease. 55. Narsinghpur.20 The Civil Surgeon directed the Vaccinators to work in a regular order so that he might know if any portion of the district remained unprotected at the close of the season, and he found that rather less than a third of the people had not had vaccination carried out among them: this he attributes to the large size and population of the circles and the great difficulty in getting hold of the people in March as they are then all occupied in their fields. There was an increase of 314 in the number of operations, but the increase is entirely in re- vaccinations, there being a decrease of 669 in the number of primary operations. Re-vaccination rose from 224 to 1,207, but the greater part of the operations were performed on children of from 3 to 9 years of age. The Native Superintendent was on tour 125 days, visited 487 villages, inspected 7,135 vaccinated children, and returns the percentage of success as 93.72. he is well reported of. The Civil Surgeon was in camp only 29 days, he visited 109 villages, saw 1,300 vaccinated children, and gives the percentage of success as 94: dispensary work detained him in the station. The attitude of the people is the same as it was last year. DISPENSARY VACCINATION. Vaccination by Hospital Assistants was confined to the limits of the townsin which the dispensaries are situated. This has caused a falling off in thenumbers vaccinated, especially by the Hospital Assistant of the Sohagpur dis-pensary, who used in previous years to vaccinate in villages far distant from hisdispensary. SMALL-POX. The police returned 213 cases of small-pox (with 1 death) in 122 of whichvaccination was said to have been performed. The Civil Surgeon feels sure from enquiries which he has made that many cases of this disease are not reported. 57. Nimar.21 Of the 303 re-vaccination operations, 32.67 per cent proved successful, and care was taken that as far as possible only cases of real re-vaccinations were entered as such. The Civil Surgeon spent 44 days in camp, visited 230 villages and inspected 4,821 vaccinated persons: he returns the percentage of success as 85.1 instead of 97.10 claimed by the vaccinators. This difference was due chiefly to the occurrence of a large number of cases in which although the vesicles were doubtfully developed the result had been entered as successful. In a good many cases he found the results had been entered without proper inspection by the vaccinators, but in only very few had unsuccessful cases been entered as successful. The registers were found correct, and in the villages which the Civil Surgeon visited he found most of the chil- dren under 10 years of age vaccinated. The Native Superintendent spent 160 days on tour, visited 542 villages, and inspected 11,242 vaccinated persons; he is very favourably reported of by the Civil Surgeon. The bulk of the people accept vaccination if not with intelligent or great good will at least as an established custom, but members of the Borah, Bun- niah and other exclusive classes do all in their power to conceal and protect their children when Vaccinators are in the neighbourhood: there has not been any instance of pronounced opposition. The Civil Surgeon acknowledges the assistance afforded by the Malguzars of Rustumpur, Songir and Mundi. DISPENSARY VACCINATION. There was a falling off in the number of operations performed by HospitalAssistants, the numbers being 372 as compared with 413 in the previous season.This decrease is due to the Medical Officer of the Khandwa and Burhanpurdispensaries having been relieved of Vaccination work entirely and to the areaof work for those at the other dispensaries having been confined to the limits oftheir towns. SMALL-POX. Can scarcely be said to have appeared in this district: one case occurred in the town of Khandwa in the person of a girl who had apparently acquired the disease while on a visit to Holkar's territory. No death from the disease was reported. The Civil Surgeon remarks that &quot; Dr. Cullen's continued efforts have &quot; familiarized the people with vaccination so that it is now generally accepted. &quot; The result is that small-pox has ceased to be an important factor in the mor- &quot; tality of the district.&quot; 58. Betul. 22 1,622 operations: this is due to a stop having been put to the practice of re- turning as re-vaccinations, cases in which the operation had been repeated in consequence of previous failure. The vaccinators return their percentage of success as 95.63 or 2.29 less than that of the previous season, the difference being due to more care in recording the results. The Civil Surgeon was on tour 41 days and saw the work of each Vaccin- ator. He inspected 2,801 vaccinated children and found the percentage of success 96.35, and can only account for his finding the ratio of success higher than that returned by the Vaccinators themselves by supposing that unsuccess- ful cases were not brought forward. The Officiating Native Superintendent and 1 Vaccinator are unfavourably reported of. DISPENSARY VACCINATION. Hospital Assistants performed 396 primary operations or 32 less than they did last year. SMALL-POX. Was prevalent in a number of villages. The cases seen by the Civil Sur- geon being chiefly in adults and unprotected children of from 5 to 12 years of age. In the cases of several vaccinated children who were said to have had the disease the Civil Surgeon could not find any trace of it. 59. Chhindwara.23 SMALL-POX. Only 24 cases (with 10 deaths) were reported during the year; but the Civil Surgeon thinks that the reports are not much to be relied on. 60. Seoni.24 SMALL-POX. The deaths from small-pox were chiefly in the parts of the district border- ing on Rewah. The Civil Surgeon considers that the present staff is not suff- cient to admit of the whole district being worked over in one year. 62. Balaghat.25 SMALL-POX. 364 cases with 71 deaths were reported during the year, the Civil Surgeon cannot say in how many cases the sufferers had been vaccinated. The Native Superintendent is well reported of. 63. Bhandara.26 65. Wardha. Vaccination was carried on throughout the non-working season. The English lymph proved good. The Native Superintendent was on tour for 121 days and inspected 9,110 vaccinated children; he is favourably reported of. The Civil Surgeon took charge of his duties on the 4th December, but did not get into camp till February: he was altogether 28 days in camp (a case of serious illness and having to attend the Sessions Court necessitated his return sooner than he intended) and inspected 2,011 vaccinated children in 115 villa- ges. The number of operations was 1,079 less than in the previous year. The decrease is said to be due to the more abundant crops of Jowari and cotton having drawn away a larger number of people than usual from their homes. The Civil Surgeon says that in small villages there is little difficulty in getting all the children born during the year vaccinated, but that it is not so in large villages and towns in which there is much passive opposition, especially among the Brahmins, Marwaries, and Bunniahs. DISPENSARY VACCINATION. Both the number of operations and the percentage of success are lower than they were last year. The Hospital Assistants were, with the exception of the one at Deoli, directed to vaccinate only within the town limits, and all of them except the one at Sindi state that they have great difficulty in inducing the parents to have their children vaccinated. SMALL-POX. The disease prevailed in nearly every police circle, the total cases being 415 and the deaths 70. 66. Chanda. The lymph became inactive in July so that there was not any vaccination done in August and September. The English lymph received early in October yielded successful results and from the children operated on with it a supply was raised sufficient to allow of the Vaccinators going in November to their circles with a good supply. The Civil Surgeon reports unfavourably of the work: there being only1 Vaccinator whom he reports well of. The total number of persons vaccinated is 675 less than it was in the previous season. The attitude of the people is reported to be one of indifference: the old hostility is said to have died out. The Civil Surgeon was on tour 6 weeks and inspected the work of 6 of the 10 Vaccinators. DISPENSARY VACCINATION. Hospital Assistants vaccinated 158 fewer persons than in the previous season. The reason being that those in charge of the Chanda and Warora dispensaries were exempted from this duty.
27 SMALL-POX. The Police reported 1,682 cases with 89 deaths in the whole district, 31 cases without any deaths were reported as having occurred in the town of Chanda, 12 of those attacked having been, it was said, vaccinated. 67. Bilaspur.28 children still unprotected, he cannot accept this explanation as satisfactory. The Municipal Vaccinator worked badly and altogether neglected the villages round the town. The average number of operations performed by each Vaccinator is 379 less than in the previous year. Re-vaccination operations rose from 88 in the previous year to 162. The percentage of success in primary operations is given by Vaccinators as 96.83: by Civil Surgeons, 90.58. The Civil Surgeon was on tour 29 days and inspected the work in half the circles, visiting 194 villages and inspecting 3,155 vaccinated children. The Civil Surgeon met with an accident at the end of February which prevented him being out for long in March. In many villages the Civil Surgeon could not obtain the (village) forms as in some they had not been left by the Vaccinator, and in others the malguzar with whom the forms had been left was absent. The Civil Surgeon did not find the names of any unvaccinated children entered in the registers ; but he found that in some instances the results were not correctly recorded in consequence of the Vaccinator having failed to re-visit the village and ascertain the results : he saw more cases of axillary abscesses than in previous years, and attributes them to the way in which the operation was performed. Arm to arm vaccination was less practiced than usual, due to some extent, he thinks, to the difficulty experienced by the Vaccinators in inducing parents to take their children to other villages in the heavy rains in December. The Native Superintendent was on tour 146 days and found the work in some circles bad, and the results not correctly recorded. The Civil Surgeon is of opinion that the Native Superintendent &quot;has taken considerable pains in his work.&quot; There was not any vaccination carried out in the Zamindaries of Gondai Silhete, Parpori, Lohara, Burbaspur and Thakur Tola during the year as there was not any Vaccinator available. FEUDATORY STATE VACCINATION. There was not any work in the Chhuikhadan State during the year. The Native Superintendent appointed in January to inspect the work in the Feudatory States and Zamindaris was 61 days on tour. He is well reported of. DISPENSARY VACCINATION. The number of operations performed by Hospital Assistants in charge of dispensaries was 986 as compared with 2,558 in the previous year. The reason assigned by the Civil Surgeon for this falling off is that at Arang the Hospital Assistant's work was confined to the town and that the Hospital Assistants in Raipur were exempted altogether from vaccinating.

REPORT ON THE VACCINE OPERATIONS IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES FOR THE YEAR 1886-87. NAGPUR: PRINTED AT THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE PRESS. 1887. [PRICE 8 AS.]
No. 4124 A./241. Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner, Central Provinces, dated Nagpur, the 14th August 1887, READ letter No. 1145 V., dated the 23rd ultimo, from the Deputy Surgeon-General, Central Provinces, submitting the Vaccination Report for 1886-87. READ also the Report. RESOLUTION. The work done by the Department shows an improvement, the number of operations performed having increased since last year by 25,404. The increase occurs both in Provincial and Feudatory State vaccination. The work done by Dispensary establishments has slightly decreased. 2. There was a decrease in the amount of work done in six districts. This is attributed in some instances to illness, but for the most part to bad work among the vaccinators. The decrease in the work done by the Dispensary establishments is explained by the reduction of the vaccination duties of the Hospital Assistants of five dispensaries as mentioned in paragraph 25 of the Report. 3. There is a satisfactory increase in the amount of primary vaccination reported from the Feudatory States, but it must be remembered that these figures cannot be verified as certainly as in the Districts. The Rajah of Reh- rakole appears to be still hostile to vaccination in his State. In none of the Raipur zamindaris except Bindra Nawagarh was any vaccination carried on, no funds having been provided for the work. 4. The average proportion of success to the total number of cases is about the same as last year, but this ratio fluctuates considerably. As returned by vaccinators it varies from 89.59 in Damoh to 98.62 in Chhindwara, and as regards the Feudatories, from 91.82 in Khairagarh to 100 in Bamra and Reh- rakole. As returned by Superintendents it varies from 75.71 in Jubbulpore to 97.80 in Sambalpur, and as returned by Civil Surgeons from 67.65 in the Sakti State and 82.53 in Seoni to 98 25 in Mandla. The percentage of success in cases of re-vaccination varies from 39.73 in Nimar to 96.59 in Mandla. It is not clear why there should be such fluctuations from district to district in the relative proportions of persons over and under one year of age successfully vaccinated, as shown in columns 9 and 10 of Statement I. 5. The deaths from small-pox decreased, the ratio being . 34 per 1,000 against an average of .40 for the preceding five years. As last year, Bhandara is at the head of the list with 1,343 deaths, nearly 2 per 1,000; the next being Chanda, with 275 deaths. The Deputy Surgeon-General attributes the high death rate in Bhandara to neglect of work and careless vaccination, and his inspection in Chanda showed the work there to be decidedly indifferent. 6. As regards the attitude of the people towards vaccination, the Deputy Surgeon-General notices the opposition met with in the Nagpur district, and to a less extent in Wardha. Opposition is also complained of among the
2 better classes in Jubbulpore. In connection with this the Chief Commissioner in his review of last year's Report desired Civil Surgeons always to bring to notice the names of persons who had aided the cause of vaccination. This has been done by the Civil Surgeons of Nimar, Wardha, and Raipur, but by no others. The Chief of Raj-Nandgaon took an interest in the work, and vac- cination has made great progress in that State. The Municipal Committee of Burhanpur are said to have been inclined to oppose. The Chief Com- missioner understands, however, that their opposition has ceased. 7. More inspection work was done both by Civil Surgeons and Native Superintendents. The amount of inspection done by the Civil Surgeon, Sam- balpur, was again insignificant, which is unfortunate, as last year the Deputy Surgeon-General emphasised the necessity for inspection in this district. The Deputy Commissioner has, however, elaborated a scheme, which has received the Chief Commissioner's approval, and under which vaccination work will not only be more efficient, but will also be more systematically supervised and controlled. 8. The Chief Commissioner has under consideration the question of pre- scribing a standard of work to be required from the Native Superintendent of each district with reference to local circumstances. The general principles under which the minimum standard should be fixed have been intimated to the Deputy Surgeon-General; and he has been asked to submit detailed proposals. At the same time the Chief Commissioner thinks that there is more faith to be placed in close supervision than in mechanical check. The best check lies in the close scrutiny of diaries of work done, and as much local inspection as Civil Surgeons can manage to overtake. 9. The Chief Commissioner observes with regret that the Report, due in this office by 1st June, has only been received in print on the 6th instant. He will expect that the Deputy Surgeon-General will not allow the unpunc- tuality noticed in his letter submitting the Report to recur. The bulk of the Report must also be very considerably abridged. It is unnecessary to give so much district detail. ORDER.No. 1145 V. FROM: JAMES H. LOCH, ESQ., M. D., SANITARY COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces. To THE SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces. Dated Nagpur, the 23rd July 1887. SIR, I have the honour to forward the Report on the Vaccine operations in the Central Provinces for the year 1886-87 for submission to the Chief Com- missioner. I regret that I have been unable to submit the report on the proper date, but in spite of reminders, the statements were not all received till near the close of June, and the last District Report did not reach this office till the 11th instant. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, JAMES H. LOCH, M. D., Sanitary Commissioner, Central Provinces.
Report on Vaccination in the Central Provinces during the year 1886-87. There has been an increase of nearly 25,000 in the total number of opera- tions on that of the previous year as shown in the following table. Table I.2 4. The cost of each successful case of vaccination performed by the Vaccination department was Rs. 0-1-11 as compared with Rs. 0-1-11¾ in the pre- vious year, or including those by the Dispensary Establishment Rs. 0-1-10 as compared with Rs. 0-1-10¾ in 1885-86. VACCINE DEPARTMENT. (Provincial and Feudatory States.) 5. The table given below shows the chief points in the working of the Vaccine department. Table II.3 DISPENSARY VACCINATION. (Provincial and Feudatory States.) 8. The work done in the two past years is compared below :4 12. There was not any vaccination in the Khuji Zamindari of the Raipur district as the necessary funds had not been provided. Bindra Nawagarh was the only Raipur Zamindari in which vaccination was carried on in the past year, the reason of no work having been done in the others being the same as that stated in the case of the Khuji Zamindari. 13. The number of operations has increased by 17,837, the increase having taken place in both primary and re-vaccination. The only districts in which there was a decrease are Damoh. (99), Mandla (1,503), Betul (1,906), Nagpur (1,710), Bilaspur (1,510), and Sambalpur (839). The small decrease in Damoh is due to the illness of two Vaccinators, these being the only men in whose circles there was not an increase of work. The number of operations was less in Mandla because vaccination could not be carried on in October and November. The lymph supply failed in September and the English lymph proved bad. The decrease in the work of Betul is ascribed by the Civil Surgeon to the smaller number of births in 1886 and consequent smaller number of children available. The smaller amount of work done in the Nagpur district is attributed to the illness of three Vaccinators, (one of their best men having been laid up nearly all the season,) to one man being detained in Nagpur in a criminal case and to a new hand having taken the place of an experienced Vaccinator promoted. There was considerable sickness among the staff of the Bilaspur district, and this, with bad work by one or two of the Vaccinators, is held to account for the lesser amount of work. The decrease in Sambalpur is altogether in the work of the Zamindari Vaccinators and was due to new men having as usual to be engaged and to their not getting to work till late. The report of the Civil Surgeon, Mandla, shows that the failure in the lymph supply was due to bad work on the part of the Vaccinators. I think that in the Nagpur district arrangements might have been made for the performance of the work of at least one of the Vaccinators who were ill: the Civil Surgeon's remarks show that this man is never likely to be fit for work In Bilaspur the Native Superintendent's inspection was altogether unsatis- factory, and this will account for the laziness of Vaccinators complained of by the Civil Surgeon, who only took charge of his duties at the end of December. 14. There is a large increase in the number of cases of Re-vacoination in Saugor, Jubbulpore, Chhindwara and Balaghat, while there is a very decided decrease in the Mandla district. 15. The number of Vaccinators is 5 more than it was in 1885-86, but, as in the Jubbulpore and Bhandara districts, the appointments were made to sup- ply the place of Hospital Assistants who had been exempted from vaccination duty, the real increase is 3, namely 1 (additional) for the city of Nagpur and its suburbs, 1 for Raipur town and surrounding villages, and 1 (additional) for the Phuljhur Zamindari.
5 16. The average number of operations performed by each Vaccinator is slightly larger than in 1885-86. 17. The percentage of success in primary operations is, as returned by Vaccinators, practically the same as in 1885-86 and in cases of re-vaccination very slightly higher. The highest ratio is claimed by the Vaccinators of the Chhindwara and Mandla districts and the lowest by those of Damoh whose percentage is only 89.59. In some cases the Civil Surgeon found the percentage of success higher than that claimed by the Vaccinators themselves : the explanation of this is that the Civil Surgeon saw the successful result of a repeated operation, in cases where the first had failed and been recorded as unsuccessful by the Vacci- nator. 18. The total cost of the department was upwards of Rs. 500 more than in 1885-86, the increase being almost entirely in Travelling Allowance: the pay of Establishment was less, the larger amount drawn as travelling allowance is due to allowances not drawn in last year being included in this year's accounts, and to a higher rate having been admissible under the rules to the Civil Surgeon Balaghat, and to the longer time spent on tour by Civil Surgeons of Saugor, Betul and Bhandara. The cost of each successful vaccination was rather less than in 1885-86. FEUDATORY STATE VACCINE DEPARTMENT. 19. The work of this Department in the two past years is shown below :6 20. Vaccination was carried out in all the States in which there had been work in 1885-86, and only in those, so that the figures of the two years can be justly compared. There was a very satisfactory increase in the total number of operations. the increase being almost entirely in primary operations. This must be the case for some years to come, seeing that but comparatively few persons can have up to the present time been vaccinated a sufficient number of years to warrant re-vaccination, the work having been started comparatively recently in most of the States. The only States in which there was not an increase are Khairagarh, Kala- handi and Sakti, the decrease in the last being nominal and in Kalahandi small. The decrease in Khairagarh is attributed by the Civil Surgeon to the reduction of staff of Vaccinators by two, but while this may account for the decrease it will not satisfactorily explain the small amount of work done by the Vacci- nators as compared with that by those in Nandgaon. One of the Vaccinators in Khairagarh gives the remarkable results of 91.82 percentage for primary and 97.92 for re-vaccination as those of his success ; neither the Civil Surgeon nor Superintendent saw the cases of re-vaccination. There was a very satisfactory increase in the work in the States of Nandgaon (2,829), Bamra (2,236), Raigarh (1,347) and Sonpur (1,017). 21. The Khairagarh State employed two Vaccinators less than in 1885-86, but in all the other States the number was the same during the two past years. There has been a most remarkable rise in the number of operations performed by each Vaccinator in the Bamra (1,118) and Sonpur (509) States; but the entire management of the work in the first is now in the hands of the Rajah, and the Vaccinators in the Sonpur State were also appointed by the Rajah. The work of the latter was inspected by the Feudatory State Native Superintendent, but as there is not any information in the Civil Surgeon's report as to the result of the inspection, I am unable to say if reliance can be placed in the returns of the Vaccinators in these two States. 22. In the Sonpur State the Vaccinators were not paid any salary, but allowed to levy a fee of one or two annas for each child vaccinated. The Deputy Commissioner addressed the Rajah on the subject. At the commencement of the season the Rajah of Rerakhole refused to allow vaccination in his State, as one of his family was to be married; he how- ever was induced to alter his decision, but not till February. 23. There is but little difference in the total cost and in that under the different heads in the past year and in 1885-86. The larger number of unsuccessful operations reduced the cost of each from Rs. 0-1-7 to Rs. 0-1-4¼.

The prevalence of the disease in Bhandara is due I believe to neglect of work and in some circles to vaccination being carelessly performed. The opposition to the work in the Nagpur district must cause many of the children to be unprotected. The remarks of the Civil Surgeons on the cause of the prevalence of this disease are summarised in the abstracts of the District reports. INSPECTION TABLE. District. No. of days out on tour.

11 32. The inspection of the work in the districts of Nagpur and Jubbul- pore was as in 1885-86 carried out by the Assistant to the Civil Surgeon and by an Assistant Surgeon respectively, 33. The Civil Surgeons of Hoshangabad and Sambalpur spent considerably less than a month on tour. Heavy surgical work at the dispensary and cases of sickness among the European residents being the cause in the case of the Civil Surgeon, Hoshangabad, and bad health, the presence of cholera and cases of sickness at Head-quarters in that of Dr. Poynder. These 2 Civil Surgeons had also Medical charge of the Wings of the Native Infantry Regiment at their respective stations. The amount of work seen daily by the Civil Surgeon, Sambalpur, while on tour is very small. Dr. Willmott. Civil Surgeon of Bhandara, the smallness of whose inspec- tion work was noticed in last year's report, has in this year's District report ex- plained that he was unable to start on his tour till the beginning of February and that shortly after he had started he had to return to and remain at Head- quarters on account of work in connection with the jail. As the report last year was not written by Dr. Willmott he could not explain the circumstances. 34. The Native Superintendent of Bilaspur was, owing to illness, a very short time on tour and the Native Superintendent of Betul was also too short a time on inspection duty. The inspection work of the Native Superintendent Bilaspur, was not satisfactory. The Native Superintendent for Feudatory States in Bilaspur and Sambalpur is said to have done his work honestly and well in. the former district, but to have shown a want of method in his work in the latter. 35. I inspected the vaccination work in the districts of Nagpur, Wardha, Chanda, Bhandara and Balaghat in the course of my tour. 36. The lymph supply failed as it does every non-working season in some districts: the English lymph proved good with some exceptions. Dr. Cullen renewed his supply from animal lymph which he had procured in London. The attention of Civil Surgeons has, in acoordance with the orders of the Govern- ment of India, been called to the subject of improving and renewing their sup- ply by passing the lymph through the calf. I found in the course of my inspections, as I have on previous occasions, that Vaccinators are not sufficiently careful in selecting and using only lymph that is quite free of all admixture of blood, pus, &c., that is taken on the proper day and that has not become inert or worse from long keeping. The use of points for the storage of lymph was stopped to a considerable extent last season, and will, I hope, be altogether suspended. The percentage of success in the Nimar district that resulted this year from the use of lymph raised directly from animal lymph is not higher than the ratio of former years, which speaks well for the quality of the supply usually employed. 37. The total and the successful primary operations are both more nume- rous than in 1885-86, but not as many as in 1884-85.
12 38. As regards the proportion of the infant population protected, the Government of India in their review of last year's report, in estimating (from the number under 1 year successfully vaccinated ) the proportion of children born during the year that was protected, calculated the number of infants available at 40 per 1,000 of the population, but I think this is too high a ratio. The number of the infants available in the year (1886-87) under review was13 42. No falsification of the returns was found at the Civil Surgeons' or my inspection ; but the Civil Surgeon's report shows that in the Raipur district there was still the same carelessness on the part of Vaccinators in filling in the results, as found by myself in 1886, so that it is doubtful if their results can be accepted as trustworthy. In the other districts the worst that was found was that cases considered doubtful and in a few cases unsuccessful by the Civil Surgeon had been entered as successful by Vaccinators; this I also found in my inspection, and it will always be so. 43. The proportion of the persons vaccinated seen both by Civil Surgeons and by Native Superintendents was larger than in 1885-86. The question of the standard of work for Native Superintendents is now under the consideration of the Chief Commissioner. 44. I saw but a comparatively small amount of the current year's work in the Nagpur district, as I inspected it early in the season, but I am convinced from what I saw that the Vaccination establishment has greater difficulties to contend with in this than in other districts in the way of opposition from the Malguzars and people. In the Wardha district there is also opposition, but not so general nor so strong as in Nagpur. The work seen by me was generally good. In the Chanda district, though in one or two circles the work was good, it was on the whole decidedly indifferent and in one circle very bad. It was the first year that the Native Superintendent had worked in the district, and as the Civil Surgeon was ill all the first part of the working season and had to go on sick leave on 8th February, no Civil Surgeon's inspection work was done till after that date and then by a Medical Officer new to the district The work in the Bhandara district was generally good, but in two circles vaccination had evi- dently been neglected in former years and badly done this season, the result being many cases of small pox in several of the villages which I inspected. In Balaghat there does not appear to be any opposition and the work is with few exceptions good. 45. The work of the Hospital Assistants showed me that some of them require more careful teaching DISTRICT VACCINATION. 46. The following is a precis of the reports submitted by Civil Surgeons :14 DISPENSARY VACCINATION. There was an increase of 48 in the total number of operations by Hospital Assistants, 5 having done more and 3 less work than in the preceding season. The Hospital Assistants in charge of the Main and Sadr Bazaar dispensaries did no vaccination, the work being made over to the Vaccinator. The percentage of success of the Hospital Assistants' work as seen by the Civil Surgeon is 95.72 or slightly higher than that of the Vaccinators. The Civil Surgeon was 40 days on tour, saw the work of 351 villages and 4,074 cases of vaccination. The Native Superintendent inspected the work in 742 villages and saw 10,145 vaccination cases ; he is well reported of. The Police returned the number of deaths from small-pox as 264, An out-break of disease was if not due at least prolonged by neglect of duty on the part of the Vaccinator in whose circle it occurred. Damoh.15 SMALL-POX. There were 102 deaths from this cause against 86 in 1885-86. The Civil Sur- geon says that there is no doubt many children escaped vaccination in 1885-86, as there were a large number of marriages, and the children were moving about with their parents; further there are many small villages in the hilly jungly parts of the district which are visited by the Vaccinators only once in 2 years. The Civil Surgeon considers that an additional Vaccinator is required in order to thoroughly carry out vaccination all over the district. Jubbulpore.16 Narsinghpur.17 Hospital Assistants, the increase being at all the dispensaries. At Hoshanga- bad the Hospital Assistant was relieved of this work, which was made over to the Medical Officer of the Kothi Bazaar dispensary. SMALL-POX. There were 300 cases with 13 deaths reported by the police, most of the cases occurred in the Hoshangabad, Harda and Timurni circles and in the towns of Hoshangabad and Harda. Nimar.18 The Civil Surgeon had to keep the Native Superintendent with his camp for some time and this considerably curtailed the inspections of the latter, who is favourably reported of. The cost of each operation is somewhat enhanced by the inclusion of a sum of Rs. 166 Travelling allowance, the greater part of which should have been drawn in 1885-86, but was left undrawn till April 1886. The attude of the people is said to have been decidedly obstructive in many instances, and on the whole less favourable to vaccination than formerly. The Burhanpur Municipal Committee were not inclined to aid the cause of vaccination, but the Civil Surgeon acknowledges the assistance he received from the members of the Committee at Khandwa and he mentions the following Tahsildars, Malguzars and others as having given help :19 An outbreak of the disease had existed at 2 villages for some days without being reported till the Civil Surgeon visited the villages and cases are not reported even in the Municipal towns. Mandla. 20 promises to be a good Superintendent. The Vaccinators had, the Civil Surgeon found, operated on children in bad health and otherwise unfit for vaccination at the time, the results in most of such cases being doubtful. DISPENSARY VACCINATION. The operation by the 2 Hospital Assistants numbered 254 less than in 1885-86. The decrease at Badnur is due to the Hospital Assistant's work being con- fined to the Municipal limits, but no satisfactory explanation, the Civil Surgeon thinks, has been given of the decrease at Multai. The percentage claimed by the Hospital Assistants is only 87.97, the Assis- tant Surgeon who writes the report has not had an opportunity of finding out the cause of this low rate as compared with that of the Vaccinators. In the few cases of small-pox which the Civil Surgeon had an opportunity of examining he found that the persons were unprotected infants or adults without any marks of vaccination, Chhindwara.21 The Native Superintendent was on tour 148 days and saw on an average rather more than 78 cases a day ; he is well reported of. DISPENSARY VACCINATION. The Hospital Assistant at the Chhindwara dispensary performed 169 more operations than in 1885-86, his primary cases being 25 less. At Lodhikhera there were 338 fewer operations performed than in 1885-86. The decrease is attributed to the illness of the Hospital Assistant and to a feeling against vaccination. Dr. Martin states in proof of the necessity of the Civil Surgeon inspecting as much of the district as possible, that in one circle 1,188 operations were performed after he had visited it towards the close of the season, few of which, he believes, would have been performed but for his visit. SMALL-POX. 1 death from this disease was reported by the Police, it is doubtful if it were not a case of chicken pox in a weakly boy. Seoni.22 The percentage of success claimed by the Vaccinators is 82.57 or upwards of 8 lower than that of last year, the cause being that in consequence of the larger emigration from the district the Vaccinators could not ascertain the results in a much larger number of cases than last year. The ratios of success found by the Civil Surgeon and Native Superintendent were 88.20 and 89.68 respectively, the cause of the difference from that of the Vaccinators being that results which were not seen by the Vaccinators were found successful by the Civil Surgeon and Native Superintendent. Re-vaccinations were more numerous than last year by 2,141. The per- centage of success in them as claimed by the Vaccinator is 55.95, which is the same as that returned by the Civil Surgeon. The Civil Surgeon considers the quality of the work satisfactory and the quantity as much as could be effected under the supervision of the Native Superintendent and Civil Surgeon. DISPENSARY VACCINATION. The work of each of the Hospital Assistants was more than it was last year. The Civil Surgeon was on tour 59 days and saw 6,378 children belonging to 395 villages. The Native Superintendent was on tour 161 days and saw 7,438 children of 609 villages, besides accompanying the camp of the Sanitary Commissioner for 8 days; he is on the whole well reported of. The Civil Surgeon drew a higher rate of travelling allowance than he did in 1885-86, and this has raised the cost of each successful operation. The Civil Surgeon reports the people to be favourably disposed to vaccination. SMALL-POX. There were 267 cases and 80 deaths, being fewer cases but more deaths than in 1885-86. The Civil Surgeon cannot say how many of those attacked had been vaccinated. Bhandara.23 The Native Superintendent was 152 days on tour, visited 822 villages, and saw 11,195 vaccinated persons. He is fairly well reported of, but is indifferently educated. The Civil Sur- geon considers the Vaccinators insufficiently educated and paid, but that their work taken all round is fairly good. DISPENSARY VACCINATION. The vaccination was taken out of the hands of the Hospital Assistant in charge of the Bhandara Dispensary towards the close of the season, a Municipal Vaccinator having been appointed at each of the out-stations; the Hospital Assistant vaccinated more persons than in 1885-86, the total increase being 277 and the largest (150) at Tumsar. Nagpur.24 The number of operations is 387 more than in 1885-86. The percentage of success claimed by the Vaccinators is 96, almost the same as in the pre- vious year. The Civil Surgeen was 38 days on tour, visited 153 villages, and saw 2,613 vaccinated children. The Native Superintendent was on tour 146 days, visited 740 villages, and inspected 10,622 vaccinated persons. He vaccinated a consi- derably smaller number of children than he did last year as he devoted himself more to inspection. The Civil Surgeon says that he has attended to the usual routine of his duties satisfactorily during the year. The Civil Surgeon reports as last year that in the small villages the Mal- guzars are ready to help and vaccination is readily carried out, but in many of the large ones there is very great difficulty, the Malguzars giving no assistance especially in villages in which there are two or more of them. The Civil Surgeon names the following persons as having given aid to the Vaccinators and Hospital Assistants in their work. Sheik Bhikan, Conservancy Darogah at Hinganghat, who, as in former years, gave much assistance. Dajiba, Malguzar of Birool. Mahade Rao 25 in another with a population of 1,159 in which 18 cases occurred, only 8. In the former the disease attacked unvaccinated infants, and in the latter children over 12 years of age who had not been protected. Ghanda.26 Re-vaccination operations numbered 291 more than in 1885-86, the total number being 453. DISPENSARY VACCINATION. There was a small decrease of 81 in the number of operations by Hospital Assistants and the work of two is not well reported of. The Civil Surgeon was on tour only 27 days, indisposition and charge of the Native Infantry for a month being the causes which prevented his spending a longer time in the district. The number of villages visited was 159 and the cases of vaccination seen 3,326, including persons vaccinated the previous year. Dr. Trimnell found in some of the circles very decided carelessness in the performance of their duties by Vaccinators, including incorrect returns of results. The Khalsa Native Superintendent was on tour 139 days, visited 886 villags and saw 12,968 children : he inspected in 15 of the 18 circles, and he is said to have worked well. The ratio of success is by Vaccinators ... 96.53 27 Malguzar Agardass of Bhandar. 28 former. There is a decrease in the number of operations due to sickness among the staff and the death of one of the men, necessitating the employment of a new hand, and laziness on the part of some of the Vaccinators. The Civil Surgeon was 35 days on tour, visited 278 villages and saw 3,361 cases of vaccinated persons, of which he found 2,888 or 85.9 per cent successful; he found many cases of ulceration due to the applications put on by the parents and in many of the village forms he found unsuccessful and doubtful cases entered as successful, but no false entry of names. The Native Superintendent was ill in the early part of the working season, and as the Civil Surgeon did not appoint a substitute the period spent on inspec- tion tour by this officer was only 77 days, during which he visited 605 villages and saw 8,956 cases of vaccination, the ratio of success being 90.8. He is not well reported of. The Civil Surgeon says that opposition to vaccination is dying out and instances a case in which on the appearance of small-pox in their villages two Malguzars came for the Vaccinators and had all the unprotected children vaccinated. He thinks that the staff is still weaker than it should be. DISPENSARY VACCINATION. The number of operations by the Hospital Assistants in charge of the khalsa and zamindari dispensaries is considerably less than in 1885-86. This decrease is attributed at head-quarters to the Hospital Assistant's other duties preventing him giving much time to this work. The Hospital Assistant in charge of the Seorinarain and Pandaria dispen- saries vaccinated more cases than in the previous year. The returns of the Kawardha State had not been received, but in Sakti both the Vaccinator and Hospital Assistant had done less work, the first of these was ill for some time and a new man took his place. In Kawardha the work was not altogether satisfactory. The Feudatory State Native Superintendent, who inspects also in the Sambalpur district, was on tour in the district 98 days and saw 4,134 cases of vaccination ; be is well reported of for the trustworthiness of his work. Sambalpur.29 DISPENSARY VACCINATION. The total number of persons vaccinated is rather more than in 1885-86, in consequence of the large number of operations by Hospital Assistant Hyder Hoosain of the Sambalpur dispensary. The work in the town of Sambalpur had nearly come to a standstill, as the people objected to their children being vaccinated or lymph taken from their arms ; but for the payment of a small sum people from the neighbouring villages brought their children, and with the aid of the Civil and Municipal authorities work has been carried on since March. FEUDATORY STATE VACCINATION. Many of the men were new and did little work, but most of those who had been previously employed performed more operations than in 1885-86. The work in the Sonpur State is now in the hands of the Rajah. There was a satisfactory increase in the number of operations, but the Civil Surgeon reports that in place of paying the Vaccinators the Rajah allowed them to levy a fee of one or two annas for each child. The Rajah has been addressed on the subject by the Deputy Commissioner. Vaccination was not carried on in the Rerakol State till the Deputy Commissioner had written to the Rajah, and work did not commence till February. The dispensary work at Sarangarh was small, but at Raigarh it was good, The Feudatory State Native Superintendent was 20 days in the States and saw 1,224 cases of vaccination, he is said not to arrange his work well. The Civil Surgeon says that he finds it difficult to get Vaccinators for the Feudatory States, as they are not paid during the non-working season, and he thinks that the prosecution of two Vaccinators last year for taking money illegally has had some effect in stopping applicants, as they cannot now increase their income by this means.

COMPARATIVE STATEMENT No. IV.NOTES ON THE ANNUAL STATEMENTS OF VACCINE OPERATIONS IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES FOR THE YEAR 1887-88. NAGPUR : PRINTED AT THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE PRESS. 1888. [ PRICE EIGHT ANNAS. ]
No. 4574/241 Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner, Central Provinces, in the General Department, dated Nagpur, 3rd August 1888. Read the Annual Statements of Vaccine operations in the Central Provinces for the year 1887-88 with notes by the Deputy Surgeon-General. RESOLUTION. Under the orders of the Government of India in Home Department Reso- lution No. 28-1579-95, dated the 15th July 1887, the Vaccination Report is prepared triennially instead of annually, the statements only with brief notes being submitted in the intervening years. 2. The total number of persons vaccinated again increased during the year under report, the operations performed by the Departmental staff having risen to 4,11,908 as against 3,85,536 during the previous year, omitting from the latter the figures for the States of Bamra and Sonpur which have not yet been received for the year under report. Of this increase 13,890 occurred in the Pro- vincial area and 12,482 (equivalent to 31 per cent) in the Feudatory States. The former increase is accounted for by the figures for Raipur (7,860) and Sambalpur (7,212). During the year under report the vaccination staff was re-organized and strengthened in the Chhattisgarh Division to enable it to undertake the work of the zamindaris of that Division as well as of the Khalsa. The Superintending charges were also revised so as to include the Khalsa, Zamin- daris and Feudatories in a single scheme. Five more vaccinators were added to the Raipur, and two to the Sambalpur staff, and their appointment is more than sufficient to account for the increased number of operations in these two dis- tricts. Similarly part of the large proportional increase in the Feudatory States occurred in Raigarh (6,461) and Sarangarh (1,434) which each entertained two additional vaccinators during the year. Kalahandi also had a large increase (4,852), while there was a considerable falling off (3,880) in Nandgaon. 3. The percentage of success claimed by vaccinators was slightly higher, being 96.08 against 95.48 in the previous year for primary operations and 73.99 against 73.27 for re-vaccinations. The ratios of successful cases as seen by Civil Surgeons and Native Superintendents, which are not given in the statements, are also said to vary but slightly from those of 1886-87. The Government of India in Home Department letter No. 288, dated 30th September 1887, expressed the opinion that the percentage of success claimed by vacci- nators was open to doubt, being some 6 per cent higher than that ascertained by Civil Surgeons and Native Superintendents. The lower percentage last referred to is however partly explained by the fact that inspecting officers naturally spend more time in the circles of vaccinators whose work is considered bad. 4. The total expenditure of the Department rose from Rs. 40,245-3-11 to Rs. 42,783-7-1 in the Provincial area. The increased cost was met from District Funds and is due to the increased establishment entertained in the districts of the Chhattisgarh Division to which reference has already been made. The Feudatory State expenditure fell from Rs. 3,733-15-6 to Rs. 3,314-15-3. The re-organization of the staff in the Chhattisgarh Division while increasing the number of vaccinators by 4 in the Feudatory States, as already mentioned, effected on the whole a saving to the Chiefs in the cost of establishment.
2 5. In the review of last year's report it was mentioned that the Chief Commissioner had under consideration the question of prescribing a standard of work to be required from Native Superintendents. A general standard appli- cable to all districts was found impracticable, but the Chief Commissioner sanc- tioned the adoption of a standard framed by the Deputy Surgeon-General for each district prescribing the number of villages to be visited and the number of vaccinations to be seen daily by each Native Superintendent. Civil Surgeons were also instructed to regulate the tours of their Native Superintendents. The Chief Commissioner also had under consideration during the year the question of the general adoption of the vaccination census introduced by Dr. Cullen in Nimar, to which reference was made in paragraph 6 of the Review of the Report for 1885-86 ; it was, however, found desirable to leave the adoption of the scheme to the discretion of Civil Surgeons. 6. The Deputy Surgeon-General does not refer to the question of culti- vating buffalo lymph to which allusion was made in the review by the Govern- ment of India of last year's report. He will be asked to report on this question now. ORDER.No. 1176V. FROM JAMES H. LOCH, ESQ., M. D., SANITARY COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces, To THE SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces. Dated Nagpur, the 29th June 1888. SIR, I have the honour to forward you for submission to the Chief Com- missioner, the Annual Statements of Vaccine operations in the Central Provinces for the year 1887-88 with notes on them. 2. The Statements and notes would have been submitted earlier, but I wished, if possible, to include the figures of all the Feudatory States in which work was carried on: as, however, the returns from Bamra and Sonepur have not yet been received in my office, I think it better to forward the Statements incomplete than to delay their submission longer. 3. The vaccination work in these two States is in the hands of the Chiefs. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, JAMES H. LOCH, M. D., Dy. Surgeon Genl., Sanitary Commr., and Superintendent of Vaccination, Central Provinces.
Notes on the Annual Statements of Vaccine operations in the Central Provinces for the year 1887-88. The area to which the Statements of 1887-88 refer is not quite the same as that of 1886-87; for while vaccine operations were carried on in 11 zamindaris in which there was no work in 1886-87 : the figures for the Bamra and Sonepur States cannot be given owing to the returns not having been received, and I have therefore in comparing the work of the two last seasons excluded that done in these 2 States in 1886-87. STATEMENT I. (Vaccine Department.) The number of Vaccinators employed in the Central Provinces (including Feudatory States) was larger (+11) and the total number of persons vaccinated more (+ 26,372) than in the previous season. The number of primary operations increased ( + 30,784) while that of re-vaccinations was (4,412) less. Each vaccinator performed on the average nearly the same number of operations as in 1886-87. In the Khalsa (including zamindaris) the number of vaccinators employed was (7) more, the increase being in the staff for the zamindaris of Raipur and Sambalpur2 STATEMENT II. ( Vaccine Department.) The work in the khalsa cost more (+Rs. 2,538-3-2) than in 1886-87, the increase having taken place in the cost of establishment and of contingencies. The increase in the amount paid to establishment was due to the appointment of apprentice vaccinators and to the entertainment of a larger staff for the zamin- daris of the 3 eastern districts. The amount drawn as travelling allowance was less (-Rs. 296-1-9), the difference being due partly to Uncovenanted Medical Officers having been in charge of districts which were last season held by Covenanted Medical Officers, and partly to a smaller amount of inspection work having been done in some districts. The increased cost was met almost entirely by District Funds (+Rs. 2,635-3-8) Provincial Funds having contributed less and Municipal very slightly more than in 1886-87. The cost of each successful operation in both the Khalsa and Feudatory States was practically the same as it was last season. In the Feudatory States the work cost somewhat (Rs. 419) less than in 1887, the decrease being in both cost of establishment and contingencies. STATEMENT III. (Dispensary Vaccination).

No. IV.NOTES ON THE ANNUAL STATEMENTS OF VACCINE OPERATIONS IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES FOR THE YEAR 1888-89. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] NAGPUR: PRINTED AT THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE PRESS. 1889. [PRICE EIGHT ANNAS.]
No. 4521/237 Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner, Central Provinces, in the General Department, dated Nagpur, the 26th July 1889. READ2 5. The total expenditure on vaccination rose from Rs. 46,098-6-4 to Rs. 49,004-5-5 (omitting the States of Bamra and Sonpur). Rules framed by the Superintendent-General for the appointment, pay, promotion, &c., of the Vacci- nation Establishment throughout the Province received the sanction of the Chief Commissioner at the commencement of the year: and before the year closed the organization of the whole staff of Vaccinators and Superintendents at work in the zamindaris as well as in the Khalsa (excluding those vaccinators employed in Feudatory States, Municipalities and Cantonments) as a single establishment divided into grades, was carried into effect. 6. With reference to the remarks made by the Government of India, in its review of the Report for 1886-87, on the subject of the cultivation of buffalo lymph, it is to be noted that in three districts buffaloes were success- fully inoculated with vaccine virus and that the lymph obtained from them was successfully used for the vaccination of children. ORDER.No. 1386. FROM J. RICHARDSON, ESQ., M. B., SANITARY COMMISSIONER AND SUPDT.-GENERAL OF VACCINATION, Central Provinces, To THE SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces. Dated Nagpur, the 19th June 1889. SIR, I have the honour to forward, for submission to the Chief Commis- sioner, the Annual Statements of Vaccine operations in the Central Provinces for the year 1888-89, with Notes on them. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, J. RICHARDSON, M. B., Sanitary Commissioner and Supdt.-General of Vaccination, Central Provinces.
Notes on the Annual Statements of Vaccine operations in the Central Provinces for the year 1888-89. 1. Except that the area within which Vaccine operations were carried on included 27 instead of 18 Zamindaris, and 13 instead of 9 Feudatory States, it remained the same as during the preceding year. STATEMENT No. I. 2. The strength of the Vaccine Establishment shows an increase of 6 Vac- cinators as compared with its strength during the previous year. Of this increase, 3 Vaccinators are credited to the Provincial, and 3 to the Feudatory States Estab- lishment. 3. The number of persons successfully vaccinated, excluding cases of re-vac- cination, was 392,246. This gives an increase over the figures of the previous year of 13,703. But from this number must be deducted the numbers success- fully vaccinated in Bamra, Sonpur, Chhuikhadan and Kanker Feudatory States, leaving an increase for 1888-89 over that for the preceding year of only 7,095. The returns from the Feudatory States named were not included in the previous year's returns; and therefore, in making a comparison between the work of the two seasons, the returns for these States must be omitted in the case of both. 4. The percentage of successful primary vaccinations was 95.96, or the same as for the previous year. It is doubtful if the actual ratio of successful cases was so high. In one district the mistake has been made of including &quot; unknown &quot; cases among those recorded as &quot;successful.&quot; This is obviously wrong. Likewise, it is the acknowledged custom in the same district, when a vaccine operation fails, not to record it as &quot; unsuccessful;&quot; but to repeat the operation, and to enter the result as &quot;successful&quot; if it proves to be so at the second attempt. Such a case should be recorded twice : once as &quot;unsuccessful'' and once as &quot; successful.&quot; In many of the districts, the percentage of success- ful cases claimed by the Vaccinators considerably exceeds the percentage ob- tained by Civil Surgeons as the result of their examination of a large number of cases. 5. The total number of re-vaccinations was 26,177; and the percentage of successful cases 78.21. It need not be remarked that a low ratio of successful re-vaccinations may be taken as an indication of efficient primary vaccinations. Many high authorities still maintain that if a first vaccination is properly per- formed re-vaccination is never afterwards necessary. The number of re-vaccina- tions for the year 1888-89 shows an increase over the number for the preceding year of 8,128. In this comparison the numbers for Sonpur and Bamra are excluded. 6. The average number of vaccine operations performed by each Vaccinator was 1,734, or slightly less than during the previous year, when it was 1,745. In some districts, such as Chhindwara, the average number exceeded 3,000 : in others, such as Damoh, it did not reach 1,500. Yet it does not necessarily follow that the Vaccinators of Chhindwara worked twice as hard as the Vaccinators of Damoh. In a district in which the people are opposed to vaccination, or in which the population is sparse and the villages difficult of access, it may involve more labour to vaccinate ten persons than to vaccinate twenty in a district in which those conditions are reversed. The Vaccinators employed in the Feuda- tory States show a much lower average number of operations performed by each than the Provincial Vaccinators: the former are credited with an average of only 1,295; and the latter with an average of 1,835 per Vaccinator. 7. Of the 18 districts of these Provinces, 11 show an increase in the num- ber of primary operations; and 7 show a decrease. The districts in which the most marked increase took place are those of Sambalpur, Jubbulpore and Nar- singhpur; and those which show the largest decrease, Raipur and Nimar.
2 8. Inoculation is practised in some of the Eastern Districts. The Civil Sur- geon of Raipur states that it is extensively carried on in that district. He says that where it is known to be practised, there small pox has been worst. In Bilaspur the civil authorities sentenced each of three Inoculators detected prac- tising their craft in that district, to three months' rigorous imprisonment. In Raipur the civil authorities &quot; have not yet obtained the support of legislation &quot; against a baneful system of this kind ;&quot; but have done all they legally could to prevent the practice of inoculation. 9. The number of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population for the Provinces has been 37.51. The birth rate for the year 1888-89 was 41.68. Roughly calculating the proportion of children who die under one year of age, or are unfit for vaccination on account of sickness, at one-fourth of the number born, it is evident that if all the operations were performed on children under one year of age, full protection to the population against small pox would be afforded. 10. The ratio of the population vaccinated varies greatly in different dis- tricts. In Sambalpur it is recorded as being 61.58; and in Damoh only 26.24 per 1,000. 11. The proportion of Vaccinators to population, also, varies greatly. In. Sambalpur there is one Vaccinator to every 37,640 of population : in Bhandara there is but one to every 62,161. The Civil Surgeon of Bhandara complains that the vaccination staff is too weak for the requirements of his district. His com- plaint seems to be well-grounded. 12. A very favourable feature of the season's work is the increase in the proportion of operations performed on children under one year of age. During 1887-88 the number of children under one year of age who were successfully vaccinated was 173,924: during 1888-89 this number rose to 196,985. In some districts, and notably in the District of Raipur, the increase was very great. 13. Between the 1st of April 1888 and the 31st March 1889 the recorded deaths from small pox numbered about 15,279. As showing the influence which vaccination exercises on the prevalence of small pox, it may be noted that, in the 7 districts in which the proportion of persons vaccinated almost equalled, or exceeded, the Provincial birth rate (41.68), the ratio of deaths from small pox per 1,000 of population was 0.33; whilst in the 11 districts in which the ratio of persons vaccinated per 1,000 of population fell below the Provincial birth rate, the ratio of deaths from small pox per 1,000 of population was 2.32, or seven times greater. 14. In three districts buffaloes were successfully inoculated with vaccine virus, and the lymph obtained from them successfully used for the vaccination of children. In several other districts calves were successfully inoculated, and a supply of vaccine lymph obtained from them for beginning the season's work. STATEMENT No. II. 15. It will be seen that the total cost of the Vaccination Establishment, Provincial and Feudatory, amounted to Rs. 48,902-1-5 (excluding the expendi- ture in the Feudatory States of Chhuikhadan, Kanker, Sonpur and Bamra), as compared with Rs 46,098-6-4 for the previous year. There was thus an in- crease of expenditure of Rs. 2,803-11-1, as compared with the expenditure for the previous year. The cost of each successful case of vaccination was Rs. 0-1-11: during 1887-88 the cost was Rs. 0-1-10 ½. STATEMENT No. III. 16. This Statement gives details of Dispensary vaccination. The total num- ber of successful primary vaccinations was 12,378; and of these, 8,028 were per-
3 formed on children under one year of age. Last year the recorded numbers were 12,914 and 8,406. There has, consequently, been a slight decrease in the Dispen- sary vaccination for 1888-89 as compared with the preceding year. STATEMENT No. IV. 17. This Statement shows that the progress of vaccination in the Central Provinces since 1867 has been steady: in that year the number successfully vacci- nated was 15,060: in 1889 it was 404,624. 18. The Civil Surgeons and Native Superintendents of Vaccination, bet- ween them, inspected 341,972 cases of vaccination during the season. The time and labour which Civil Surgeons in these Provinces give to the work of vaccina- tion would surprise the Civil Surgeons of other Provinces. J. RICHARDSON, M. B., NAGPUR: Dy.

No. IV.REPORT ON THE VACCINE OPERATIONS IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES FOR THE YEAR 1889-90. NAGPUR: PRINTED AT THE SECRETARIAT PRESS. 1890. [ PRICE 8 As.]
No. 5974/ 608 Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner, Central Provinces, in the General Department,2 5. The following figures, showing the total number of operations per- formed in the Central Provinces in each of the three years under review, are taken from the table given in paragraph 4 of the Report :3 7. The decrease in the number of primary operations is unsatisfactory. The explanation given for some districts that it is due to the low birth-rate of 1889-90 and to the heavy mortality of children under one year, can only be accepted where it can be shown that the total population requiring protection was worked up to, and there seems reason to believe that in some districts it was partly due to neglect on the part of the supervising agency to exact a full tale of work from the vaccinating staff, and to the incompetency or mis- behaviour of some of the vaccinators. The supply of lymph also appears to have failed (paragraph 3 of the Report.) After allowing for the prevalence of sickness in the Province during the past year, the Report points to the need of improved handling of the existing staff; and the Chief Commissioner trusts that, under the orders of the Superintendent-General, it may be more uccessfully worked during the approaching open season. 8. Reference is made in paragraph 8 of the Report to certain orders issued to the Inspector-General of Education in June 1889. It was there said that the Chief Commissioner did not object to vaccination being made a con- dition of the grant of prizes in schools and also of result grants. It was also said that schoolmasters should use their influence to get the boys in their schools vaccinated, and arrange to secure a full attendance of scholars on the occasion of the visit of the vaccinator to the school. Civil Surgeons were to be instructed by the head of their Department to have vaccinators sent annually to every school. The Chief Commissioner trusts that under these orders children not already protected, and who might otherwise remain unprotected, may escape attack by small-pox. 9. The total expenditure on vaccination and the average cost of each successful case in each of the three years of the triennium are given below :No. 1614/505 FROM J. G. PILCHER, ESQ., SANITARY COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces, To THE SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces. Dated Nagpur, the 12th July 1890. SIR, I have the honour to submit the triennial Report of Vaccination in the Central Provinces and its Feudatory States and Zamindaris for the period ending with 1889-90. The report has been delayed on account of the numerous references which have been made regarding the statistics, the last return having reached my office on the 5th June 1890. The return of the Patna State has not yet arrived and it is not considered desirable to wait for it. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, J. G. PILCHER, Sanitary Commissioner and Superintendent-General of Vaccination, Central Provinces.
[Triennial] REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES, FOR THE YEAR 1889-90. 1. The strength of the Vaccine Department in these Provinces remained the same in the last three years, but in the year 1887-88 the staff in the Chhattisgarh Division was so strengthened that the work in the Zamindaris might be undertaken by it. This increase of strength included the appointment of addi- tional Native Superintendents to supervise the extra work in connection with the three districts of that Division. 2. The area in which vaccine operations were carried on in the past season was about the same as in the previous year, but I regret that the returns of the Patna State are not included in the Report, as they have not been received. Sources of Lymph. 3. In many districts the supply of lymph from arm to arm vaccination was kept up throughout the hot weather and rains. In others, the general sick- ness of the population prevented the continued cultivation of lymph, and opera- tions ceased till fresh supplies could be procured from England and elsewhere. In some districts animal lymph was cultivated and with the product the work of the season was commenced. The usual indent for English lymph was sent in February, and the supply did not reach this office till November. Besides English Bovine lymph, supplies of animal lymph were received from Bombay, Berar and the North-Western Provinces and distributed to each district. 4. The following table shows the total number of vaccine operations in the Province for the past three years performed by vaccinators and Civil Hospital Assistants, both in the Khalsa and in the Feudatory States.
2 TABLE I.3 The total operations of the year 1889-90 was 396,584, or 27,710 less than the previous year, excluding, as before stated, the number of operations per- formed in the Patna State in 1888-89. The percentage of successful primary operations was 96.26, or 0.30 greater when compared with 1888-89; and that of successful re-vaccinations 28.00, against 78.21 in the previous year. Operations by Khalsa Vaccinators. 7. The total number of vaccine operations performed by khalsa vaccinators in 1889-90 was less by 26,644 than in 1888-89, and the decrease in primary operations was very marked4 In this connection it is desirable to show how far the birth and mortuary statistics of the Province support this view of Medical Officers, and to this end a table has been drawn up showing the total births in the seasons 1888-89 and 1889-90, the number of deaths of infants under one year, the number of children available for vaccination, and the number of successful operations reported to have been performed on children under one year of age.

These figures show that in 4 districts only have all the children avail- able for vaccination been protected. All the individuals born in the periods of comparisons may have been unfitted for operation by tender age, but there will have remained from each previous year a like number of unprotected infants, and the figures showing the total available for vaccination may be con- sidered as fairly correct. This table shows that in the matter of the protection of infants available for vaccination Raipur, Bilaspur, Bhandara, Nagpur, Sambalpur, Mandla and Chanda were very deficient and in the order given. From some districts, reports of the insufficiency of the vaccination staff have been received, and there is evidence that this is the case, and the necessity will not be overlooked. 11. Of the 18 districts of these Provinces, 14 show a decrease in the number of primary vaccinations and 4 an increase. The increase at Damoh, Balaghat and Bhandara is very slight, but at Raipur it is more than 2,000. The decrease in the primary operations at Sambalpur is very great, and amounted to 11,688; but, on the other hand, there was an increase of 13,896 in re-vaccinations, so that the total operations of this district including both primary and re-vaccinations is 2,208 more than the previous year.
5 12. At Chhindwara the decrease in primary operations is 5,390, but there is an increase of 3,498 in re-vaccinations, the difference representing the fewer operations done in comparison with the previous year. In explanation of this difference, the Civil Surgeon refers &quot; to the considerably smaller number of &quot; births as compared with the previous season6 Dr. Cullen notes that he saw at his inspections numbers of needless cases of re-vaccination, and he found it necessary to restrain the zeal of vaccinators in this respect. No doubt this would affect the result of the year's work. Dr. Cullen's explanation is borne out by the fact that a larger number of infants than are shown by the vital statistics of the district to have been available for vaccination were protected during the season. 18. In the Jubbulpore and Mandla Districts the decrease in primary operations was above 2,000. At Jubbulpore the strength of the vaccine estab- lishment was increased by one vaccinator in 1889-90, and the average work of each vaccinator fell from 1,989 in 1888-89 to 1,739 in the past season. The Civil Surgeon's explanation of this decrease is that there were fewer unprotected persons at the beginning of the last season, and the vital statistics show that of the 16,168 children available, 15,481 were protected by vaccination. The illness of the vaccinators has also injuriously affected the results of the past season's work. In Mandla the average of the work of each vaccinator was 1,496 as com- pared with 1,777 in the previous season. This was due, the Civil Surgeon reports, to the protracted illness of 2 vaccinators. But this is not a wholly satisfactory explanation, because the work of a sick man can to a certain extent be provided for, and this does not appear to have been done. The personal inspections of the Civil Surgeon were unavoidably limited. 19. At Chanda, Saugor and Nimar the decrease was above 1,000 in primary operations, and at Betul and Hoshangabad it was above 500. Inoculation. 20. Inoculators have doubtless been at work in some parts of the Province, but there have been no cases brought to notice of prosecution for inoculation during the past season ; and the Civil Surgeon of Raipur, in whose district inoculators are reported to have been working in past seasons, reports that he had not met with any evidence of their presence in the past season. Calculation shows that the ratio of population vaccinated in the past season varies considerably in different districts. It was 64.15 in Sambalpur and 26.21 at Nagpur, the provincial mean being 34.67. 21. As remarked by my predecessor, the good effects of vaccination are seen in the fact that of the 5 districts in which infant vaccination was most thoroughly carried out, small-pox was least fatal; while in the remaining 13 in which the vital statistics show a large number of children remaining unpro- tected at the end of the season, the disease was more prevalent and fatal. The mean death-rate per 1,000 of population of the 5 districts from small-pox was 0.33, and in the remaining 13, 1.46. 22. In the precis of the District Reports will be found notes of the extent to which animal lymph has been cultivated. Buffalo calves have been found to yield good results in some districts, and cow calves in others. The exclusive use of animal lymph over a given area was tried at Jubbulpore, and a special report of the result of the experiment was submitted with this office letter No. 13297 Inspection Table, 1889-90.

At Khairagarh, Kanker, Sonpur and Kalahandi, the total operations performed was more, and in the other States it was less than in 1888-89. The decrease was marked in Raigarh, where the number has fallen from 13,742 in 1888-89 to 8,790 in 1889-90. The Civil Surgeon reports that 2 of the vacci- nators of this State did not work satisfactorily, and for this reason one of them was dismissed. STATEMENT II. 25. In explanation of the cost of the Provincial and Feudatory Vaccina- tion Establishment for the last three seasons a table is appended. It shows the total cost of each season's operations, including, establishment proper, travelling allowance and contingencies. These figures give a total for the Provincial and Feudatory Establishment taken together of Rs. 49,752 against Rs. 48,313 in the previous year, and an average for each successful operation of Re. 0-2-1¼ and Re. 0-1-11 respectively.

9 The Provincial. Establishment alone cost Rs. 46,542 as compared with Rs. 45,458 for 1888-89. The increase of Rs. 1,084 in the past season is due almost entirely to the travelling allowance of medical officers on inspection duty. There was a small increase in establishment of Rs. 174 on account of the promotion of vaccina- tors, and there was a saving in contingencies of Rs. 136 compared with 1888-89. The average cost of each successful vaccination was Re. 0-2-3½. It was Re. 0-2-0½ in 1888-89. 26. In the Feudatory States the Vaccine Establishment cost Rs. 3,209 compared with Rs. 2,855 in the previous year The average cost of each successful vaccination was nearly equal. The returns of the Patna State could not be included in these calculations as they were not received in time. STATEMENT III. 27. There were 14, 692 vaccinations at the Dispensaries in the Province during the past season. But these results are less by 100 than those of the previous season. Civil Hospital Assistants in charge of Sadar and Branch Dispensaries have, in many cases been relieved of the duty of vaccination, and the grounds for this appear inadequate. The subject will have attention during the year, and also the necessity for the extension of Act XIII of 1880 to certain towns. The vaccine operations performed by each Civil Hospital Assistant are shown in the following table, and the work is certainly less than may reasonably be expected.:10 District. Name of Dispensary.

11 28. Statement IV shows the progress of vaccination in these Provinces since 1867. On the whole, it has been steady, but the past year of excessive sickness in all districts not only prevented vaccinators from keeping up their supply of lymph and maintaining the normal number of operations from April to October, but it necessitated the employment of vaccinators in the hot season in medical relief. 29. The vaccination staff itself shared in the sickness of the general population, and the District Reports show that this was a cause of decline in the work done, and this was specially so in some districts. 30. The inspection of the work of vaccination by Native Superintendents was, on the whole, satisfactory, and Civil Surgeons have done excellent work in this department of their duties. 31. The following notes are gathered from the Reports of Civil Surgeons :12 15,481 primary vaccinations were performed on children of less than one year, and in addition 571 operations were done by Civil Hospital Assistants. The establishment is not well spoken of as a whole. Three vaccinators were dismissed for indifferent or bad work and one absconded. One of the first named was a first class vaccinator. The conduct of the first three of these suggests a want of care in the selection of men and oversight of their work. The vaccine establishment of this district is supervised by an Assistant Surgeon, who is reported to have visited 536 of the villages in the district and to have seen 6,719 vaccinated children. 34. Narshinghpur.13 upon by the Civil Surgeon, and he suggests that more aid must be given. English and Bombay lymph was used successfully to begin with. There was no attempt made to cultivate animal lymph in this district. The Civil Surgeon was prevented from doing much inspection in the district owing to urgent work which confined him, but he visited 20 villages and saw 463 children. This is one of the districts which did not suffer greatly from small-pox, but yet it is found that 61 deaths from the disease occurred in infants under one year. 38. Betul.14 The Civil Surgeon saw several cases of small-pox, but all were in persons unprotected by vaccination. Seven of these were children between 6 and 7, of the Marwari caste. The Civil Surgeon reports favourably of the staff, and notes that he did not find a single attempt to falsify the records. 42. Bhandara.15 various vaccinators were supplied on the 15th October. In addition to the Bhandara lymph, supplies were obtained from Bombay and England. The English animal lymph here, as in other districts, was the most certain, and after free cultivation of it the vaccinators of the various circles were supplied. No attempt was made to cultivate animal lymph. The Civil Surgeon reports some opposition in the large towns and villages, but that, as a whole, vaccination is accepted with indiffernce. The total of operations performed was 10,902, including re-vaccinations. The percentage of success is reported to have been 95.61. The establishment is fairly well spoken of. The Civil Surgeon saw very many cases of small-pox among children, and notes the immunity of those which had been vaccinated, and that the people recognised this. The statistics of the Wardha District show that there were 9,869 infants available for vaccination, and only 7,113 operations were performed on infants. There were 273 deaths from small-pox among infants. 45. Chanda.16 The plan of work described by the Civil Surgeon is satisfactory, but some vaccinators did not finish their circles. The Civil Surgeon was prevented by illness from inspecting as much work in his district as he intended, but his observations of the work done conclusively shows the necessity for his personal oversight. The average number of operations done by each vaccinator is very small in comparison with other districts, and the small number of re-vaccinations shows that there is still more organisation required. There were 2,039 deaths from small-pox reported in this district, and 785 of these were of infants. 47. Bilaspur.STATEMENTS.

MENT No. IVNOTES ON THE ANNUAL STATEMENTS OF VACCINE OPERATIONS IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES FOR THE YEAR 1890-91. NAGPUR: PRINTED AT THE SECRETARIAT PRESS. 1891. [ PRICE 8 As.]
No. 6255/552 Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner, Central Provinces, in the General Department, 2 The steady increase of late years in the number of re-vaccinations was noticed in the Chief Commissioner's Resolution on last year's Report. There has been a further increase during the year 1890-91. 4. The increase (reported in paragraph 10 of the notes) in the number of infants and young children who were successfully vaccinated by the Provincial Vaccine Establishment is satisfactory. 5. The total expenditure on vaccination in the Khalsa was Rs. 45,747 against Rs. 46,543 in the preceding year; and the average cost of each success- ful vaccination was Re. 0-2-0¼ and Re. 0-2-3½ in the two years respectively. In the Feudatory States the expenditure has slightly risen,-mainly on account of the employment of two Native Superintendents in the States of Bamra and Kalahandi. 6. In accordance with the instructions contained in Home Department letter No. 302, dated the 15th October 1890, steps have been taken to effect the substitution of animal lymph for that obtained from human beings. Animal lymph obtained from Berar was supplied to a few districts experimentally and proved satisfactory. An Assistant Surgeon was also deputed to Berar for instruction in the details of the cultivation of animal lymph, and on his return the Berar method was given a trial in Jubbulpore. The question of cultivating animal lymph experimentally at Pachmarhi is now under the Superintendent- General's consideration. 7. The question of extending the provisions of the Vaccination Act, XIII of 1880, to the Municipalities of Nagpur and Jubbulpore has been recently referred to the Municipal Committees of those places for their consideration. The Act was extended in 1883 to the Cantonments of Jubbulpore, Saugor and Pachmarhi, and subsequently (1888) to the Municipality of Raipur; but it is only in the Cantonment of Jubbulpore that steps have been taken to bring it into active operation by the introduction (in February 1890) of rules under Section 20. 8. The Notes and Statements were two months over-due when received in the Secretariat, and the Superintendent-General should take steps to secure the punctual submission of the returns to and their prompt compilation in his office in future. ORDER.No. 2155/505 FROM THE SANITARY COMMISSIONER, AND SUPERINTENDENT-GENERAL OF VACCINATION, Central Provinces, To THE SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces. Dated Nagpur, the 28th July 1891. SIR, I have the honour to submit the Annual Statements of Vaccine opera- tions in the Central Provinces for the year 1890-91, with notes on them. The last return having reached this office on the 12th June 1891,I regret the unavoidable delay which has occurred in the submission of this report. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, G. F. A. HARRIS, SURGEON- MAJOR, for Sanitary Commissioner and Superintendent-General of Vaccination, Central Provinces.
NOTES ON THE ANNUAL STATEMENTS OF VACCINE OPERATIONS IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES, FOR THE YEAR 1890-91. In accordance with the Government of India orders, communicated in Home Department Resolution No. 282 The number of primary and re-vaccinations were increased by 37,078 and and 2,319 respectively. 5. The number of persons successfully vaccinated, excluding cases of re- vaccination, was 374,946, or 35,985 more than in the previous year. In this calculation the successful operations performed at Patna State are not included. 6. The percentage of successful primary vaccination was 96.39 against 96.26 in 1889-90, and that of re-vaccination was 4.38 less than that of the preceding year. From this it would appear that the low ratio of successful re- vaccination may be taken as an indication of efficient primary vaccinations. 7. The average number of vaccine operations performed by each vacci- nator in the Khalsa was 1,908, or 189 more than during the previous year. In the following districts the average number performed by each vaccinator was very great:3 b. The vaccinator of the Chimur circle was at Head-quarters for nearlyten days for the purpose of giving evidence before a magistrate, and when he returned to his circle he found that the supply of lymph had failed. c. In the Chundenkhera circle cholera broke out in January, and the workof vaccination was therefore stopped for a fortnight. d. Lymph failed at Chamursi circle. 9. The number of persons successfully vaccinated per mille of population for the Province has been 37.94 compared with 34.87 in the preceding year, and in the districts they varied from 60.53 in the Sambalpur District to 27.83 in that of Chanda. 10. The following are the Provincial total numbers of successful primary vaccine operations performed on infants in 1889-90 and 1890-91, from which it will be seen that in the year under review 22,348 more infants under one year were successfully vaccinated than in the preceding year, and 7,825 over one and under six years :4 STATEMENT III. 16. The total number of persons vaccinated by the Hospital Assistants- attached to the Dispensaries in the Central Provinces, both Khalsa and Native States, in 1890-91 amounted to 15,689, or 997 above that of the previous year; of which 13,808 were primary and 1,881 re-vaccinations. The total number of successful primary vaccinations was 12,955, and of these 9,308 were performed on infants under one year of age. STATEMENT IV. 17. The figures in this Statement show that the number of primary operations and of persons successfully vaccinated in 1891 has only been, exceeded in the year 1883 and 1889, the figures for 1884 being nearly equal to those of 1891. Inspection. 18. The Civil Surgeons and Native Superintendents of Vaccination inspected 82,163 and 256,624 cases respectively, and of these the Civil Surgeons found 73,282 to be successful cases, and the Native Superintendents 235,445 as successful. Sources of lymph. 19. With reference to paragraph 3 of Government of India No. 302, dated the 15th October 1890, received under Secretariat endorsement No. 6836-679, dated the 28th idem, the following accounts are given. As stated in the last year's report, arm to arm vaccination was kept up in many districts throughout the year. At the commencement of the working season English lymph was supplied to almost all the districts. In some districts, as usual, buffalo calves were vaccinated and the lymph obtained from these was used. Animal lymph was obtained from Berar and supplied to a few districts for experiment, and the lymph proved satisfactory. The Civil Surgeon of Jubbulpore states that in October last calf lymph was cultivated after the Bombay method in two cases; this gave an excellent result, and the lymph was sufficient to start the work of the season. At the commencement of the working season Assistant Surgeon Surendra Nath Barat, in charge of Vaccine operations in the Jubbulpore District, was deputed to Berar by order of the Chief Commissioner, to be instructed in the details of the cultivation of animal lymph as practised there. On his return to Jubbulpore the cultivation of &quot;Lanoline lymph paste&quot; was attempted on a limited scale, after the Berar method, with the lymph obtained from four calves. The paste prepared in the first three cases did not keep more than 48 hours ; but in the last case it kept for a week. 98 children were vaccinated with it, of whom 79 were successful.
5 In November 1890, 50 grains of animal lymph mixed with Lanoline were received from the Sanitary Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts ; this was sent to the Civil Surgeon, Nagpur, for trial, and the substance of the Civil Surgeon's report is as follows :STATEMENTS.

No. 4883. Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner, Central Provinces, in the General Department,2 5. The total cost of the Vaccine Establishment in the Khalsa for 1891-92 amounted to Rs. 46,880, or Rs. 1,133 more than in the previous year. Nearly half of this increase is due to expenses incurred in the cultivation of animal lymph at Pachmarhi. An account of the circumstances under which this cultivation was undertaken and of the results of the experiment is given in the Appendix to the Report. The Chief Commissioner was so far satisfied with the results that he has sanctioned a continuance of the experiment during the current year. At the same time he is disposed to view with more favour the plan of obtaining lymph from buffalo calves obtained locally and vaccinated for the purposeNo. 1699-505. FROM W. CENTER, ESQ., M. D., OFFG. SANITARY COMMISSIONER AND SUPERINTENDENT-GENERAL OF VACCINATION, Central Provinces, To THE SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces. Dated Nagpur, the 28th June 1892. SIR, I have the honour to submit, for the information of the Chief Commis- sioner, the Annual Statements of Vaccine operations in the Central Provinces for the year 1891-92, with notes thereon by Dr. Pilcher, in accordance with the orders of the Government of India in the Home Department, No. 28-1579-95 of the 15th July 1887. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, W. CENTER, Offg. Sanitary Commissioner and Supdt.- General of Vaccination, Central Provinces.
Notes on the Annual Statements of Vaccine operations in the Central Provinces for the year 1891-92. The following brief notes on the operations of 1891-92 are given with reference to, and in explanation of the appended Statements. 2. The area in which vaccine operations were performed in 1891-92 remained about the same as in 1890-91, but in the year under review 293 operations performed in the Makrai State, in the Hoshangabad District, have been included in the Statement. STATEMENT I. 3. The Provincial strength of the Vaccine Department was increased by 2, as compared with that of the previous year. One extra vaccinator each, was employed by the Harda and Chanda Municipalities. The strength of the Vaccine establishment in the Feudatory States also was increased by 5 vacci- nators, as follows:2 Operations by Khalasa Vaccinators.11. The Civil Surgeon accounts for the decrease in the Hoshangabad District in the absence of one vaccinator, who was deputed for duty at Pach- marhi to aid in the cultivation of animal lymph. But it was in greater measure due to the very severe fatality from cholera. The disease remained in this district till nearly the end of the year. In the Chhindwara District the Civil Surgeon attributes the decrease of work to the laxity of two vaccinators. With regard to the decline in the number of operations performed in the Raipur District, Surgeon-Major Evers reports that vaccination was much hindered by the prevalence of cholera, and in the fact that vaccinators had to be employed on special cholera duty. In Sambalpur the small decrease, when compared with the figures of 1890-91, the Civil Surgeon explains as in no way redecting on his staff, but was due to the smaller number of children available for vaccination. Re-vaccination he found to be very much disliked by the people ; and fearing it might affect the results in primary operations, he ordered re-vaccination to be done only in such cases where ready consent was given by parents and others. The Civil Surgeons of Jubbulpore, Seoni and Bilaspur have not explained the falling off in the operations done in their districts. 12. The number of persons successfully vaccinated per thousand of popu- lation for the whole Province is 38.25, against 37.94 in the preceding year. Operations by Vaccinators in the Feudatory States. 13. In the Feudatory States vaccination was somewhat more efficiently done on the whole. But there was a slight decrease of work in the Khairagarh, Sakti, Sarangarh and Kalahandi States. STATEMENT II. 14. The total cost of the Vaccine Establishment in the Khalsa for 1891-92 amounted to Rs. 46,880-3-11, or Rs. 1,133-1-11 more than that of the previous year. Nearly half of the increase is due to the expenses incurred in the cultivation of animal lymph at Pachmarhi, charged to Provincial account, and to the cost of blank forms which is for the first time debited to District Fund. The remainder is in fact due to the more liberal travelling allowance passed to Civil Surgeons in the matter of half cost of tentage, and a slight increase to the Vaccine Establishment. 15. The average cost of each successful vaccination in the Khalsa for the year was Re. 0-2-¾, against Re. 0-2-¼ in the preceding year. 16. The cost of the Vaccine Department of the Feudatory States of the Chhattisgarh Division and of the Makrai State amounted to Rs 4,263-5-4, as compared with Rs. 4,094-2-2 in the previous year, showing an increase of Rs. 169-3-2. 17. The average cost of each successful operation was Re. 0- 1-118. The total cost of the Vaccine Department in both the Khalsa and Feudatory States amounted to Rs. 51,143-9-3, against Rs. 49,841-4-2, or to Rs. 1,302-5-1 more than in 1890-91. STATEMENT III. 19. The total number of persons vaccinated by Hospital Assistants attached to the Dispensaries in the Central Provinces, in both the Khalsa and Native States, in 1891-92 amounted to 17,526, or 1,837 more than in the previous year; of which 15,305 were Primary, and 2,221 Re-vaccinations. The total number of persons successfully vaccinated was 14,090, and of these 10,686 were performed on infants. STATEMENT IV. 20. The figures in this statement, as noted in the last year's report, have only been exceeded in the years 1883 and 1889. Inspection. 21. The Civil Surgeons and Native Superintendents of Vaccination as usual inspected most of the vaccine operations in their respective districts, with the following results :In 1891 a vaccinator was, with the approval of the Chief Commissioner, sent from Raipur to Berar to watch the details of animal vaccination carried on there. On his return to Raipur 3 calves were vaccinated, 2 on the 4th October and the 3rd on the 9th idem. The lymph so obtained was passed through a second series of calves, and the supply of animal lymph from this source was sufficient to enable the Civil Surgeon to send 50 tubes of it with each vaccina- tor to commence work in their respective circles. The Vaccination Act of 1890 was extended to the Cantonment of Jubbulpore by Notification No. 844 of the 13th February 1890, and the Civil Surgeon reports that there has been no necessity to do more than issue notices to the parents or guardians of children who had not been vaccinated. The Act has not been introduced elsewhere in these Provinces. The attention of the District authorities of Raipur, Bilaspur, Nagpur and Bhandara was called to paragraph 4 of the orders of the Government of India on the review of the Vaccination Report of these Provinces for the season 1890-91, with the result that greater protection has been affordedAPPENDIX. In the last annual Report on the Vaccine operations in these Provinces, it was shown that the experimental use of calf lymph was tried at Jubbulpore and Nagpur in the season of 1889-90, in accordance with the instructions of the Government of India, as contained in Home Department's printed letter No. 32 Deducting initial expenses in the erection of the shed for the calves and in the purchase of instruments, which expenditure will not have to be incurred again in the coming season, each calf may be calculated to cost Rs. 3-8-0, and that figure may be taken as the value of 63 grains of lanoline paste. The reports of Civil Surgeons on the use of the paste were not entirely satisfactory, in that the results obtained varied considerably in different districts both in regard to the activity of the paste and the length of time during which it would remain ' sweet and good.' But making due allowance for the greater instability of animal lymph; that it could only be distributed in a diluted form; that the dilution with lano- line was a solid and therefore less readily absorbed; and that the vaccinators were inexperienced in the details of operating with it, there is abundant evidence that the paste will remain good for 20 days at least; that it is efficient, and will be perfectly successful when the vaccinators have become familiar with its qualities and the mode of using it. The Chief Commissioner has sanctioned the proposal to increase the cultiva- tion of animal lymph, so that each vaccinator in. the Province and in the Feu- datory States and Zamindaris may be furnished with a portion with which to commence the operations of the season. It may be possible hereafter to extend the cultivation, so that animal lymph may be exclusively used throughout these Provinces; but it will be safer to proceed with these experiments gradually, for it is not certain that the required number of calves will be forthcoming at Pachmarhi for so large an under- taking as the cultivation of lymph for the whole of these Provinces. I am much indebted to Civil Surgeons for the care taken to test the animal lymph paste; and where results were less satisfactory, failure was due to the difference in the physical qualities between fluid lymph and the paste, rather than to any want of appreciation of the importance of that part of the experi- ment entrusted to them.

READ2 Here again we find an improvement upon the total for 1891-92; while at the same time the results are not quite equal to those of 1890-91. This was in part due to the introduction of the new system of animal vaccination, the opposition to which in some of the districts appears, however, to be rapidly- disappearing as experience is gained of the conveniences attending it. It is noticeable that the number of infants successfully vaccinated has increased steadily, until the remarkable result has been attained that three-fourths of the infants surviving to the age of twelve months have been vaccinated. As a natural consequence there has been a considerable decrease in primary vaccina- tions of children between the ages of one and six years. 4. The explanations given by the Civil Surgeons of the districts of Sam- balpur, Bhandara and Hoshangabad3 7. The total cost of the Vaccine establishment in the Khalsa during 1892-93 was Rs. 47,919, or Rs. 1,039 more than in the previous year. In 1890-91 the cost was Rs. 45,747. The expenditure has thus gone on increasing, while the number of persons vaccinated has declined. A portion of the increase in cost is due to expenses connected with the cultivation of animal lymph at Pachmarhi. The experience gained in the use of this lymph seems to show that, while very effective when fresh, it rapidly deteriorates; and it would be neces- sary to incur a further outlay in the purchase of glass tubes for the carriage and preservation of the lymph, if the system were to be maintained. On the other hand, the plan of taking lymph from buffalo calves obtained locally and vaccinated for the purpose is being gradually introduced into all districts ; and it will probably be possible in the cold season of 1894 to dispense with lanoline lymph and depend wholly on the supplies obtained from calves. Dr. Center, the late Officiating Sanitary Commissioner, has recorded an interesting Note on the subject of Animal Vaccination, which is printed as an Appendix to the Report. 8. The Vaccination Act was extended during the year to the Municipali- ties of Nagpur, Narsinghpur, Harda, Sambalpur, Damoh and Hatta; and other towns are following the example set by these. ORDER.No. 1955-V. FROM SURGEON-COLONEL G. C. ROSS, ADMINISTRATIVE MEDICAL OFFICER, AND SANITARY COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces, To THE SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces. Dated Nagpur, the 4th July 1893. SIR, I have the honour to submit, for the information of the Chief Commis- sioner, the Triennial Report of Vaccine operations in the Central Provinces and its Feudatory States and Zamindaries for the period ending with 1892-93. I regret the unavoidable delay which occurred in the submission of this report. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, GEORGE CUMBERLAND ROSS, Surgeon-Colonel, Administrative Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Central Provinces.
[Triennial] REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES, FOR THE YEAR 1892-93. 1. The area in which vaccine operations were carried on in the past season was about the same as in the previous year. 2. The following Statement compares the establishment employed during the years 1890-91, 1891-92 and 1892-93:2 Sources of Lymph. 4. Experimental cultivation was again carried on at Pachmarhi with the view to supply a sufficient quantity of animal lymph with which to begin the operations of the working season. A brief account of these experiments is appended to this report. In many districts buffalo calves were vaccinated, and the lymph obtained from them was used by the vaccinators of the districts. As in former years arm-to-arm vaccination was also maintained in most of the districts. 5. The following table shows the total number of vaccine operations in the Province for the past three years, performed by vaccinators and Civil Hos- pital Assistants both in the Khalsa and in the Feudatory States:3 From the above table it will be seen that there has been a decrease of 9,400 in the total number of operations performed in 1892-93 compared with 1891-92. 6. No work is said to have been done by the Hospital Assistants attached to State Dispensaries at Rajnandgaon, Khuji and Sonepur in 1892-93. At Rajnandgaon no children were vaccinated by the Hospital Assistant, as the vaccination staff of the State performed vaccinations in the town. Khuji Dis- pensary has been closed; and the Hospital Assistant attached to Sonepur, being ill, was unable to perform vaccine operations. But on the other hand vaccina- tion work was carried on this season by the Hospital Assistants attached to Dhondi Lohara, Khairagarh and Rampur, while no operations were done at these dispensaries in 1891-92. For proper comparison, taking the operations performed in 1891-92 and 1892-93, excluding respectively the work done at the above dispensaries, the actual decrease amounts to 9,639. STATEMENT I. Operations by Vaccinators in the Khalsa and Feudatory States. 7. The total number of vaccine operations performed by vaccinators during the year 1892-93, both in Khalsa and Feudatory States, was 435,410 compared with 445,720 in the previous year, or 10,310 less than that of 1891-92, thus4 10. It is very satisfactory to observe that the operations performed on infants by Khalsa vaccinators are steadily increasing. The figures for the past- four years are given below:5 14. In Sambalpur there has been a great falling off. The Civil Surgeon explains this as follows: &quot; In the Khalsa this is principally due to the idleness of one of the vaccinators.&quot; The vaccinators so badly reported on have been heavily punished. 15. In the Bhandara District the Civil Surgeon explains that the decrease of work is due to want of a little timely assistance to the department in several instances by the Tahsildars of Tirora and Sakoli. 16. The Civil Surgeon, Balaghat, explains that the decrease in the number is due to the introduction of the new method of vaccination, viz., from buffalo to arm instead of arm-to-arm, which takes a very much larger portion of the vacci- nator's time, and also to there being less children available for vaccination. 17. The Civil Surgeon, Hoshangabad, attributes the decrease chiefly to the placing of an entirely new man in the Harda circle in the absence of one first class vaccinator who was appointed to act as Native Superintendent. 18. The Civil Surgeon, Narsinghpur, states that the decrease is due to lack of zeal on the part of two of the vaccinators and to the inexperience of the third. 19. The decrease in the operations at Betul, the Civil Surgeon explains, is owing to low birth-rate. 20. At Chanda the decrease in the primary operations is only 345, and the Civil Surgeon gives no reason for this decrease. 21. The following table shows the total number of children available for vaccination in each district and the number of successful operations performed in it during the year 1892-93 :6 singhpur the children under one year were protected in good proportion, while in Bilaspur, Nagpur, Mandla, Chanda, Hoshangabad, Saugor, Wardha, Raipur, Jubbulpore, Damoh, Bhandara and Seoni the number protected by vaccination was not in proportion to the number of children who were available; so that in these districts particular attention was not paid to infant vaccination. 22. The usual Inspection statement is given below, and from which it will be seen that the inspection work has been fairly carried on by most of the Civil Surgeons with the exception of a few.

7 Operations by vaccinators in Feudatory States. 23. At Makrai, Khairagarh, Chhuikhadan, Kanker, Sarangarh, Raigarh, Patna and Bamra the total operations performed was more and in the other States it was less than in 1891-92. The decrease was marked in Sonepur, Kalahandi and Nandgaon. At Sonepur only four vaccinators were employed, instead of seven in the previous year; while at Kalahandi one vaccinator more was employed, and still the work was less than in the year 1891-92. 24. With reference to paragraph 9 of memorandum by the Army Sanitary Commission on the report of the Sanitary Commissioner, Central Provinces, for 1890, copy received under Secretariat letter No. 6116, dated the 3rd September 1892, the following table is appended :8 25. I append the following table showing the number of vaccine opera- tions performed with lanoline paste and the number of successes obtained.

10 27. The cost of the Provincial Vaccine Establishment was Rs. 47,918-14-6 compared with Rs. 46,880-3-11 in 1891-92. The increase of Rs. 1,038-10-7 in the year under review is due to promotion to some of the vaccinators and to the appointment of an additional vaccinator; also partly to the cultivation of animal lymph. The average Provincial cost of each successful vaccination was Rs. 0-2-1 ¾ compared with Rs. 0-2-0¾ in the previous year. 28. In the Feudatory States the cost of the Vaccine Establishment was Rs. 4,240-6-4, against Rs. 4,263-5-4 in 1891-92. The decrease is very slight. The average cost of each successful case is Rs. 0-1-2 1/5, against Rs. 0-1-1 1/3 in the previous year. STATEMENT No. III. 29. The total number of persons vaccinated by Hospital Assistants attached to the Dispensaries both in the Khalsa and Feudatory States of these Provinces was 910 more than in the previous year. 30. The vaccine operations performed by each Civil Hospital Assistant are shown in the following table:11 District. Name of Dispensary. Number of Vaccina- tions at each Dispensary in 1891-92.

12 STATEMENT No. IV. 31. This statement shows the progress of vaccination in these Provinces since 1867. On the whole it has been steady. The figures have only been exceeded in the years 1883, 1889 and 1892. 32. The following notes are gathered from the Reports of the Civil Surgeons. Saugor.13 It commenced to fail about the middle of December 1892, i. e., nearly 2½ months after its receipt. The cases (17) vaccinated by the Assistant Surgeon proved all successful. In no case did any great constitutional symptoms appear except fever, lasting from two to four days. There was no ulceration in any case. The system of animal vaccination being quite new in the district, the vaccination staff met with considerable opposition on the part of the villagers in general, and so the work made very little progress until towards the beginning of January 1893. This system, however, is now working fairly well and will soon gain popularity. In all 491 calves were vaccinated in the district. The total number of operations performed amounts to 32,828, against 29,238 for the year preceding, being an increase of 3,590. Of these, 1,172 (pri- mary) have been performed by the Civil Hospital Assistants. The increase in the number of operations is due to the abundant supply of lanoline paste and fresh bovine lymph. Assistant Surgeons Rajoni Kantha Das Gupta and Durga Das Sen were deputed to inspect vaccination in this district. They are reported to have visited 672 villages and inspected 7,658 children. 35. Narsinghpur.14 ing from the 20th September 1892. Altogether 2,427 operations were done with it, of which 2,384 proved successful. The paste was active, and if used properly and carefully never failed to bring about successful vaccination. The total number vaccinated by human lymph was 7,625, of which 7,603 were successful, and the total number vaccinated with calf or buffalo lymph was 5,603, out of which 5,204 are said to have been successful. Animal vaccination was carried on in this district as far as possible, but it was not commenced in the beginning of the season. The instructions to carry out this new system of vaccination was received late in November, and a considerable time was lost in getting parwanas from the Deputy Commissioner for assistance in procuring calves. By the time this was done the vaccination season was nearly half over. Still a good commencement has been made. But in the next season this method of vaccination will be extensively carried on throughout the district. There is a slight falling off in the number of vaccinations in the district. This decrease is due to the placing of an entirely new man in the Harda circle at the time Vaccinator Syad Ishaq was appointed to act as Native Superin- tendent, and consequently there was a falling off this year. The Civil Surgeon was 31 days out in the district, and inspected 1,097 children, with a percentage of success of 97.72; and he reports that the vaccin- ation he saw was good. The permanent Native Superintendent being sick, his place was filled up temporarily on the 4th January by Vaccinator Syad Ishaq, who inspected a good deal of the work in the district. He also did good work in instructing the vaccinators in the mode of conducting animal vaccination. 37. Nimar.15 the vaccinators working, the lymph failed. This temporary failure was, how- ever, overcome by obtaining six tubes from the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Poona. Eight instalments of lanoline lymph paste were received from Pachmarhi from 22nd September to 5th October. It was in excellent condition and very active; and the success obtained with it was highly satisfactory. The second supply received from Narsinghpur was not quite as successful. A total of 1,520 operations were performed with the lanoline paste, of which 1,321 were successful. The operations done with the Narsinghpur lymph were 468 with 368 successful cases. The vaccination staff was thoroughly instructed in animal vaccination and the use of lanoline paste. There were some obstacles to carry out the opera- tions by vaccinating cow-calves by Brahmin vaccinators. These were gradually overcome; the Brahmins willingly vaccinated buffalo calves. The animal vac- cination has, however, made some progress this season. More energy will be displayed in this direction in future. The vaccination staff is reported to have done good work, with the excep- tion of one vaccinator, by name Bhagwan Singh, who did not work in his own circle, but kept poaching in the circles of other men; so that, though he has given a good number and the work done is good, he caused considerable incon- venience to other vaccinators by spoiling their line of work. He has been warned. The Civil Surgeon was out on vaccination tour of inspection for 56 days, and inspected 6,607 operations with 6,479 successful cases. There occurred only 17 deaths from small-pox in the district. 39. Betul.16 It is reported that with the exception of one vaccinator (Khudayar Khan) all the vaccinators have done good work. Only three deaths from small-pox were reported during the year; so the district seems well protected. 40. Chhindwara.17 As regards animal vaccination, the vaccinators state that they have met with great difficulty. This seems entirely due to a semi-religious and semi- superstitious belief amongst the Hindus that, in allowing themselves to be vaccinated from calves or buffaloes, they are in a way partaking of the animal, and so acting contrary to their religion. Proper assistance was not afforded by the headman of the village in some instances, and, lastly, some difficulties had arisen from the unwillingness of all villagers to lend their animals. The Civil Surgeon visited 121 villages and inspected 1,154 cases. 42. Balaghat.18 There is a falling off in the work of vaccination this year compared with that of 1891-92, and this can be explained by the fact that the Tahsildars of Tirora and Sakoli did not assist the Department. The Civil Surgeon visited nine of the twelve circles and was out altogether 64 days inspecting 2,502 children; his percentage of success was 91.49. 44. Wardha.19 The results of animal vaccination have been fairly satisfactory as far as numbers are concerned, but it has certain drawbacks, such as the objection of people to lend their buffalo calves for inoculation, and the want of confidence in the system amongst the people. The Civil Surgeon was out on inspection duty 31 days and inspected 2,707 children, of which 2,577 were successful. 47. Raipur.20 clean, well defined and firm. The paste from Narsinghpur was a comparative failure, only 28.40 per cent. of the operations proved successful. Animal vaccination was well carried on in this district. No difficulty was found in getting animals, though the people preferred leading buffalo-calves to cow-calves. The Civil Surgeon states that, as far as he was able to inspect the work of the vaccinators, he thinks they deserve credit for the successful way in which they have introduced vaccination from the calf ; 2,607 children were vaccinated with the lanoline paste, of which 2,146 were successful. 49. Sambalpur.APPENDIX. Note on Animal Vaccination in the Central Provinces in 1892. The experimental depôt at Pachmarhi for the preparation of animal lymph and lanoline paste was established from the 14th September to the 16 th October. The operations were conducted by Assistant Surgeon Surrendra Nath Barat under my personal superintendence. Attached were an Hospital Assistant and a Veterinary Hospital Assistant to inspect the animals as regards health. There was no necessity for the purchase of animals or establish- ment of a cattle-farm; calves were easily obtained for hire at the rate of Rs. 2 each, as the people now are aware that no harm to the animals follows the operation. In a more populous place no doubt they could be obtained more readily at a smaller cost. The lanoline paste was transmitted to the various districts in order to start and spread vaccination at the beginning of the working season, and not with a view of supplying any great part of the Province with vaccine. Yet enough was distributed for about 30,000 children. The opera- tions were very successful and were conducted with scrupulous attention to cleanliness. Only one animal failed to take, though tried repeatedly. The paste proved satisfactory and was very favourably reported on. It was distributed in ordinary paste-board pill-boxes by post. It would be a great improvement if it were sent out with antiseptic precautions in short strong glass tubes with paraffined corks. This would no doubt improve the purity of the supply and make it keep efficient for a longer time. These results were obtained at a strikingly small cost. Five hundred rupees had been sanctioned, and only Rs. 160 were spent. The following is the statement of the operations and results submitted by Assistant Surgeon Surrendra Nath Barat:2 Amount collected from each calf. &quot; The amount collected from a single calf varied with the number of insertions made; but the maximum collection was ... 720 grains. minimum do. ... 50 3 who had to carry on the operations when the Assistant Surgeon was on tour. This he did not do so sucessfully. The lymph was not so favourably reported on as that from Pachmarhi, and in one instance it had been carelessly put up and packed and was useless. The total cost was Rs. 169. I consider that this experiment should be continued next year. It is not intended that these depôts should supply lymph for the whole Province, but they are useful for starting and supplementing supplies and facilitating the operations of Vaccinators. The system has now been well established of vaccinating calves and buffaloes in the villages, and of thus obtaining an unlimited supply of fresh and pure lymph which is superior in certainty and good results to any form of the stored material. Assistant Surgeon Surrendra Nath Barat has had special experience in the work and conducted the operations with great care and skill at Pachmarhi. The following is his statement of the operations during the cold weather :4 Animal Vaccination in Villages. Animal vaccination from village to village. This year a new departure was made in the way of the introduction of animal vaccination from village to village. The great difficulty that Vaccinators meet is that of getting lymph from children, for arm to arm vaccination. The people object, and with some reason, to have lymph taken from their children. Owing to this general objection, large numbers have to be vaccinated from one child, and the vesicles are irritated and many bad arms are caused. The Vaccinifers have also to be got from the lowest and dirtiest classes, which is objectionable. The mothers try to hide their children when they expect that lymph is to be taken from them, and often operations are blocked. These difficulties led me to introduce animal vaccination in the Lahore District, and as the Sikh population is very particular about the cow, probably as much so as the Maratha, I tried the buffaloe, regarding which the chief Pandits informed me there was no religious objection. This proved very successful, and now in the Punjab about 90 per cent. of vaccinations are done from animal lymph. I had strong hopes that the same thing could be done in the Central Provinces, especially as in the Maratha population of Berar, it has proved very successful. With the Gond and low caste Hindu populations and Mahomedans, no difficulty was anticipated. In Jubbulpore District there is an objection among certain classes to all vaccination. With the sanction of the Chief Commissioner I formed a class of instruction of Superintendents of Vaccination at the Pachmarhi lymph dep6t. Those from Jubbulpore, Mandla, Damoh, Betul, Chhindwara, Nimar, Seoni, Wardha, Narsinghpur and Hoshangabad were called up and passed through a course of instruction, first in selection of healthy animals and detecting signs of disease, under the Veterinary Hospital Assistant, and second in the operations and preparation of lymph. They passed an examination in these subjects and were sent to their Districts. The Superintendents of the other districts were sent to Nagpur for instruction, and I took the opportunity when visiting head-quarter towns to show the opera- tions required. Method of operation. The method of operation taught was that of valvular puncture. In preparing lanoline lymph, abraded surfaces are required for collection of large quantities of lymph, and these leave sores. In dealing with villages where comparatively small numbers have to be vaccinated at one time, punctures are sufficient. About four children can be done from each puncture. The advantages of this method are first that the puncture gets sealed up by the blood clot on drying and there is no open surface sore, and the animal can be returned in a few hours to its owner. The vaccine if properly intro- duced is securely sealed up; second, if the operation is properly done and the puncture compressed with the finger there is no effusion of blood, which is a matter of importance in the Hindu's opin- ion ; third, it only causes a vesicle like a hardened pimple and no open sore, so that the owners have less objections to the operation. In the Central Provinces in arm to arm vaccination the scratcher is almost universally used, which causes an open abrasion. In dirty children, and they are almost all dirty, this is apt to get inflamed from filth. Also the teeth of the scratcher are with difficulty cleaned, and are more apt to innoculate filth. This method is necessary for lanoline paste, which requires to be rubbed into an abraded surface. But I am certain that the method of puncture by a common bleeding lancet is much preferable where fresh liquid lymph is available. This is universally used in the Punjab and some other Provinces in preference to the scratcher. I saw a good many sore arms when examining village vaccination in the Saugor and Damoh Districts, and those were undoubtedly due to dirt getting into abraded surfaces, as the lymph used was fresh and good. The puncture becomes scaled up when dry as described, the lymph is imprisoned, there is no open sore and there is a better chance of typical vesicles in children so dirty as have to be dealt with here generally. The instructions given to the Superintendents were, first not to force any form of animal lymph on the people, but to offer it to them; second, never to make the slightest concealment of the source of any lymph they used; third, when possible to vaccinate buffaloes instead of calves; fourth to vaccinate the animals openly that people might see what was done and give rise to no erroneous rumours. The appliances used were of the simplest kindSTATEMENTS.

STATEMENT No. V.NOTES ON THE ANNUAL STATEMENTS OF VACCINE OPERATIONS IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES FOR THE YEAR 1893-94. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] NAGPUR: PRINTED AT THE SECRETARIAT PRESS. 1894. [ PRICE EIGHT ANNAS.]
No. 5758. Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner, Central Provinces, in the General Department,2 4. The expenditure of the Department increased from Rs. 47,919 in 1892-93 to Rs. 49,700 in 1893-94. Of this Rs. 12,477 was paid from Provincial and the rest from Local Funds. The expenditure in the Feudatory States increased from Rs. 4,240 to Rs. 4,478. There were five more vaccinators on the Provincial and two on the Feudatory staff. 5. Vaccination from the buffalo calf is now established in these Pro- vinces, and the successful substitution of this method for arm-to-arm vaccina- tion and the use of calf-lymph may be trusted in time to remove much of the popular objection to vaccination based on social and religious prejudices. The adoption of the Vaccination Act by Municipal Committees, who for long were consistently opposed to vaccination, is perhaps a proof of this. Up to September 1892 only a single municipality in the Provinces No. 2065Notes on the Annual Statements of Vaccine Operations in the Central Provinces, for the year 1893-94. In accordance with the Government of India orders, communicated in Home Department Resolution No. 28-1579-95, dated the 15th July 1887, the following remarks serve to elucidate the figures given in the prescribed forms of statements. 2. The area in which vaccine operations were carried on in the past season was about the same as in the previous year. STATEMENT No. I. Operations by Vaccinators in the Provincial and Feudatory States. 3. The strength of the vaccine establishment shows an increase of 7 vaccinators, as compared with its strength during the previous year. Of this increase, 5 vaccinators are credited to the Provincial, and 2 to the Feudatory States establishment. 4. The vaccinators of both Provincial and Feudatory States performed 380,488 primary and 60,168 secondary vaccinations, or a total of 440,656 operations. Last year the number of primary vaccinations performed by this staff was 394,194, and re-vaccinations 41,216, or a total of 435,410. The staff thus did 13,706 fewer primary vaccinations and 18,952 more re-vaccinations. On the whole, it will be observed that there was an increase of 5,246 operations as compared with the number last year. The number of primary vaccinations was much less during this year than in 1892-93. Most of the Civil Surgeons report that the decrease is due to the unhealthiness of the year and the excessive death-rate in children under one year of age; but partly also, at the commencement, to failure of the lymyh supply and the carelessness of some of the vaccinators, who were fined or otherwise punished. 5. The number of persons successfully vaccinated including cases of re- vaccination was 411,362, or 4,464 less than in the previous year, thus:2 Operations by Provincial Vaccinators. 8. The total number of persons vaccinated by Provincial vaccinators in the year under review was 377,145 compared with 375,639 in the previous year, or 1,506 more than that of 1892-93. 9. The number of primary operations was less (3 The following table gives the actual increase and decrease in the number of primary operations performed by the Provincial vaccinators between the seasons 1892-93 and 1893-94:4 15. The average cost of each successful vaccination for the year was Rs. 0-2-3 1/5 or about Rs. 0-0-1½ more than the preceding year. 16. The total cost of the vaccine establishment of the Feudatory States for 1893-94 amounted to Rs. 4,477-13-0 as compared with Rs. 4,240-6-4 for the previous year, or an increase in expenditure of Rs. 237-6-8. The increase is partly due to the employment of two additional vaccinators and partly in purchasing vaccine instruments, &c. 17. The average cost of each successful case was Re. 0-1-2 1/5 against Re. 0-1-2 in the previous year. STATEMENT No. III. 18. The total number of persons vaccinated by the Hospital Assistants attached to the Dispensaries in the Central Provinces, both Provincial and Native States in 1893-94 amounted to 18,903, or 467 above that of the previous year, of which 16,594 were primary and 2,309 re-vaccinations. The total number of successful primary vaccinations was 15,146, and of these 9,953 were performed on infants under one year of age. STATEMENT No. IV. 19. The figures in this statement show that the number of primary operations and of persons successfully vaccinated in 1893-94 was less than in the previous year. Inspection. 20. The Civil Surgeons and Native Superintendents of Vaccination as usual inspected most of the vaccine operations in their respective districts. The result of their inspection is given in Statement No. V appended to this report. 21. I inspected vaccine operations when on tour in the Jubbulpore, Saugor, Damoh, Hoshangabad Narsinghpur, Seoni, Chhindwara, Nagpur and Betul Districts; and the result of the inspection has already been submitted, for the information of the Chief Commissioner, in this office letter No. 7115 TABLE I.

NOTES ON THE ANNUAL STATEMENTS OF VACCINE OPERATIONS IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES FOR THE YEAR 1894-95. Nagpur : PRINTED AT THE SECRETARIAT PRESS. 1895. [PRICE ONE RUPEE.]
No. 7134. Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner, Central Provinces, in the General Department, dated Pachmarhi, the 20th September 1895. READ2 same consignment, which he attributes to unevenness of distribution of the vaccine virus in the lanoline. On the whole, however, Civil Surgeons speak well of it. Vaccination from the calf continues to make steady progress, and has, it is said, in some districts almost ousted arm-to-arm vaccination. 5. Turning now to the efficiency of protection effected, small-pox deaths rose from 861 in 1893-94 to 2,834 during the year under report; of these more than half occurred in the two districts of Nagpur and Jubbulpore, which were the scenes of an outbreak of the disease last year. No very remarkable feature characterised either, except that the Civil Surgeon of Jubbulpore notes an entire failure on the part of the police to return the deaths from small-pox until their attention was drawn to it, and even then he stigmatises their action as most deficient. The registration of vital statistics is now in the hands of Civil Sur- geons, who should promptly draw the Deputy Commissioner's attention to any such neglect. 6. The total cost of Provincial vaccination showed a decrease of Rs. 654 or Rs. 49,046-8-10 against Rs. 49,700-8-10; of this Rs. 12,309-13-0 was borne by Provincial and Rs. 2,483-2-0 by Municipal Funds. The District Councils paid for the remainder. 7. The Administrative Medical Officer in his inspection report speaks well of the work every where, except in Mandla, where he considers it to be indifferently performed. ORDER.No. 2620. FROM SURGEON-COLONEL J. H. NEWMAN, M. D., ADMINISTRATIVE MEDICAL OFFICER AND SANITARY COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces, To THE CHIEF SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces. Dated Pachmarhi, the 5 th July 1895. SIR, I have the honour to submit, for the information of the Chief Com- missioner, the Annual Statements of Vaccine Operations in the Central Pro- vinces for the year 1894-95, with notes thereon. I regret the delay that has taken place in the submission of this Report, which is due to the necessity of returning District Returns for correction more than once, and also to want of Returns for the Bamra and Patna States, which, after repeated reminders, only reached this office on the 18th June 1895. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, J. H. NEWMAN, SURGEON-COLONEL, Administrative Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Central Provinces.
Notes on the Annual Statements of Vaccine Operations in the Central Provinces for the year 1894-95. Under the orders contained in the Resolution of the Government of India, Home Department, No. 282 9. The percentage of successful primary operations was 96.42 against 95.48, or 0.94 more, and that of successful re-vaccinations was 78.18 against 79.87, or 1.69 less than in 1893-94. 10. The average number of vaccine operations performed by each vacci- nator, both in the Provincial and Feudatory States, was 1,816, or 99 more than during the previous year. Operations by Khalsa Vaccinators. 11. The total number of persons vaccinated by Provincial vaccinators in 1894-95 was 399,879, or 22,734 more than that of 1893-94. The number of primary operations was more ( + 27,802) and that of re-vac- cinations was less ( 3 The vaccinators of the other districts in which increased operations are shown in the above table, except Mandla, have also done good work. They have successfully vaccinated nearly all the children, under one year, available for vaccination. In Mandla, although 261 more operations were performed, I am not satisfied with the amount of work done. There were 9,320 children under one year available, yet only 4,855 were successfully operated upon; thus 4,465 children remained unprotected. The Civil Surgeon states that the smaller number of operations was due to the transfer of two good vaccinators on promo- tion, but I do not consider this a satisfactory explanation, and will look into the question. In Nimar, which shows a falling off, 9,386 primary operations were per- formed against 11,957 in 1893-94, or 2,571 less. This result is not so unsatis- factory as it appears, for, according to the vital statistics, most of the children under one year available were vaccinated successfully. In Damoh 585 less primary operations were performed as compared with the previous year. The Civil Surgeon reports that the decrease is mainly due to famine, on account of which many villages were deserted, the inhabitants going away to other districts. At Balaghat also 585 less primary operations were performed. The Civil Surgeon explains that it was due to the unhealthiness of the year and the larger death-rate among children under one year of age. 15. On the whole, the result of primary operations in the Central Pro- vinces as performed by the Provincial staff in 1894-95 may, I think, be regarded as satisfactory. Out of 240,103 children under one year, who were forthcoming for the purpose, 231,097 were successfully vaccinated, thus4 STATEMENT No. II. 18. The total cost of the Provincial Vaccine Department for 1894-95 amounted to Rs. 49,046-8-10 against Rs. 49,700-8-10 in 1893-94, or Rs. 654 less than that of the previous year. The decrease is mainly observed under the head &quot; Establishment&quot; and is due to the retirement from service of Native Superin- tendents and vaccinators of the higher grades and their places having been filled up in the lower grades. Besides this, in Wardha the Native Superintendent of Vaccination died in March 1894, and his place remained vacant till the working season commenced. Thus there is a decrease under the heading &quot; Establish- ment.&quot; 19. The average cost of each successful operation for the year was Re. 0-2-1½ against Re. 0-2-3 1/5 in 1893-94. 20. The total cost of the vaccine establishment of the Feudatory States for 1894-95 amounted to Rs. 4,494-10-11 as compared with Rs. 4,371-13-8 for the previous year, or an increase of Rs. 122-13-3. This is mainly due to promo- tion of some of the vaccinators. 21. The average cost of each successful case was Re. 0-1-0 2/3 against Re. 0-1-21/5 in the previous year. STATEMENT No. III. 22. There has not been much variation in the amount of vaccination work performed by Hospital Assistants attached to dispensaries, both in the Khalsa and in the Native States, in 1894-95. The operations performed by them numbered 18,673, or 230 less than that of the year previous ; and of these 16,195 were primary and 2,478 re-vaccinations. The success obtained in primary vacci- nation is represented by 14,991 cases, of which 9,727 were infants under one year of age, or a percentage of 64.89. STATEMENT No. IV. 23. From the figures furnished in this statement it will be seen that, as regards primary vaccination, the total number of operations as well as of success- ful cases has been higher in 1894-95 than in any of the previous years since 1867. Inspection. 24. The Civil Surgeons and Native Superintendents of Vaccination as usual inspected most of the vaccine operations in their respective districts. The result of their inspection is given in Statement No. V appended to this report. Surgeon-Colonel G. C. Ross inspected vaccine operations when on tour in the districts of Saugor, Damoh, Jubbulpore, Mandla, Balaghat, Bhandara and Nagpur, and the result of his inspection has already been submitted for the Information of the Chief Commissioner in this office letter No. 10985 TABLE I.

No. 6454. Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner., Central Provinces, in the General Department, dated Nagpur, the 23rd September 1896. READ2 The cause for this sudden increase in the number of re-vaccinations is no doubt to be found in the epidemic of small-pox that prevailed in certain districts of the Provinces during the year 1895-96, especially in the neighbourhood of Nagpur, the fear of contagion inducing a greater number of persons to submit to re-vaccination. 4. The number of children under one year of age vaccinated in the years 1894-95 and 1895-96 as compared with the number shown as available for vacci- nation was as follows:3 The cost between district and district varies from Rs. 0-4-0 in Balaghat and Rs. 0-5-3 in Damoh, to Rs. 0-1-4 in Bhandara and Rs. 0-2-5 in Saugor. 8. The proportion of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of the popu- lation during the period was :No. 2533-505. FROM SURGEON-COLONEL J. H. NEWMAN, M. D., ADMINISTRATIVE MEDICAL OFFICER, AND SANITARY COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces, To THE CHIEF SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces. Dated Nagpur, the 29th June 1896. SIR, I have the honour to submit, for the information of the Chief Commis- sioner, the Triennial Report of Vaccine operations in the Central Provinces, and its Feudatory States and Zamindaries, for the year 1895-96. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, J. H. NEWMAN, SURGEON-COLONEL, Administrative Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Central Provinces, Secretariat Press, Nagpur;TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES FOR THE YEAR 1895-96. Vaccine operations were carried out during last season over the same area as in 1894-95, the extent of which has not varied in the past three years. 2. The statement below indicates the establishment employed for the years 1893-94, 1894-95 and 1895-96:2 It will be seen that for 1895-96 there has been a very considerable falling-off in the work done both by vaccinators and at dispensaries, amounting in all to a diminution of 23,790 operations as compared with 1894-95, while, as compared with 1893-94, the returns show an increase of 5,916. The decrease last year was entirely confined to the Khalsa. STATEMENT I. Operations by Vaccinators in the Khalsa and Feudatory States. 4. The number of vaccinations for last working season, both primary and secondary, was 449,720, or 20,872 less than in 1894-95, although it was larger by 9,064 than the total for 1893-94. 5. The percentage of success in primary vaccination was 96.37 as compared with 96.42 in 1894-95, and 95.48 in 1893-94, while re-vaccination had an average of success of 82.11 as against 78.18 and 79.87 in the foregoing two years. Operations by Khalsa Vaccinators. 6. Excluding the returns from Native States, the entire number of primary operations was less by 33,925 than in 1894-95, but as the re-vaccinations went up by 5,484, the net total decrease was 28,441, as compared with 1893-94; primary vaccinations were fewer by 6,123 and re-vaccinations larger by 416. 7. As compared with the seasons of 1893-94 and 1894-95, the work done in dispensaries by Hospital Assistants has decreased by 1,662 and 2,270 primary vaccinations and 649 and 668 re-vaccinations in the last two years. 8. The number of children, under one year of age, successfully vaccinated in the Khalsa during the last five years was as follows:3 12. The table below gives the variation in the number of primary operations performed by Khalsa vaccinators during the seasons 1893-94, 1894-95 and 1895-96:4 The Civil Surgeon of Nagpur explains the decrease in his district by the prevalence of small-pox, the prevalence of cholera, and by a low birth-rate during last year. There were also some changes in the establishment which temporarily impeded work. The falling off in Balaghat is accounted for by the large death-rate amongst children, of whom 11,455 were born and 4,086 died, and also to the large number of migrations of families from the district owing to scarcity. Epidemics of cholera and small-pox are said to have caused the diminution in Chanda. 14. The following table shows the total number of children under one year of age available for vaccination in each district, and the number of successful operations performed on them during 1895-96.

This may have resulted from faulty registration, from the production of infants kept back previously because of their too tender age, or from carelessness or false entries on the part of the vaccinators. Probably all these causes had some effect in producing the apparent con- tradiction noticed. Where this has occurred, more than once the attention of Civil Surgeons has been directed to it. Re-vaccination. 15. Although the necessity of imposing a check on re-vaccination and of exercising a careful scrutiny of the work done in this respect was recommended to Civil Surgeons in November 1894, the returns for last season show not only an increase in the number of these operations but also a higher ratio of the success attained. In exactly half of the districts furnishing returns, there has for the season under report been a rise in re-vaccinations.
5 This is very reasonably explained in some cases as a measure rendered im- perative by invasions of small-pox, and in others is argued as having been called for by the insufficient security resulting from old vaccinations; but there can be little doubt, I think, that re-vaccination is frequently overdone, and that the establishment resort to it unnecessarily, on occasion, to supplement their other work when this falls short. The Civil Surgeon of Saugor states that re-vaccination was closely supervised, but that owing to an outbreak of small-pox, many children with doubtful marks were re-vaccinated, so were many adults. From Narsinghpur it is reported that owing to the presence of small-pox many adults, adolescents over 12, and younger people with faint marks were re-vaccinated. The Civil Surgeon of Hoshangabad states that most of his were performed on adults whom it was desireable to protect. In Nimar, re-vaccination is said to have been restricted to children with doubtful marks, and the large numbers shown to have been chiefly due to the many children of immigrants to ryotwari villages operated on. The Civil Surgeon of Betul reports that re-vaccination was freely resorted to as a large number of the people were found insufficiently protected. In Bhandara special measures were taken, when small-pox appeared, to have all children with doubtful marks and young adults re-vaccinated, and the Civil Surgeon certifies that the process was never unnecessarily carried out. The Civil Surgeons of Chanda and Sambalpur both claim that close supervi- sion was exercised and that no unnecessary re-vaccinations were performed. In Bilaspur, it is said that re-vaccinations were chiefly restricted to children, who presented doubtful marks of previous successful vaccination, but the Civil Surgeon admits that &quot; as the vaccinators could not obtain so many children for &quot;primary vaccination as in the previous year, they occupied their time in perform- &quot; ing re-vaccination in what they considered suitable cases.&quot; 16.

9 STATEMENT III. 20. There were 15,755 vaccinations at the dispensaries in the Provinces during the past season, but these results are less by 2,918 than those of the previous year. At Narsinghpur no vaccination was performed by any of the Hospital Assistants. A special municipal vaccinator was employed to perform vaccina- tion in the Narsinghpur and Gadarwara towns, as the Hospital Assistants of these were quite unable to cope with the work of vaccination on account of heavy dispensary duties. The vaccine operations performed by each Hospital Assistant in 1893-94, 1894-95 and 1895-96, are shown in the following table:10 TABLE V.11 A supply of calf-lymph sent out from England was distributed also, but with one exception it proved inert in every case where it was used. 23. The following notes are gathered from the reports of Civil Surgeons:12 lymph thus raised a buffalo calf was vaccinated in September, and lanoline paste prepared. A tube containing 30 grains was supplied to each of the dispensaries at Harda, Hoshangabad, Seoni and Sohagpur, and one each to the vaccinators of the Seoni and Sohagpur Circles. The work of the district was started early in October, and subsequently kept up with fresh buffalo lymph. The number on whom animal lymph was used was 14,312. The total num- ber of vaccination operations performed during the year was 15,001, of which 1,175 were done by Civil Hospital Assistants. The Civil Surgeon was on tour for 24 days, and inspected 1,927 children and found that 1,838 children were successfully vaccinated. The Native Superintendent inspected 4,141 children in 487 villages. Nimar.13 The Native Superintendent inspected 9,616 cases in 855 villages, and found 75.42 per cent. successful. Seoni.14 17,990 children were vaccinated with animal lymph and 4,612 with human lymph. The total operations performed in this district were 22,604, of which 891 were performed by Civil Hospital Assistants. The Civil Surgeon was on tour for more than a month, and inspected 3,437 children and found 3,145 successfully vaccinated. The Native Superintendent inspected 11,670 children in 520 villages, and found 10,877 successful. Raipur.15 regard to subordinate members (vaccinators) states that they have not done as well as they ought to have, for which they have been punished. 24. I inspected 3,488 children in the districts of Nagpur, Seoni, Chhindwara, Narsinghpur, Saugor, Damoh, Jubbulpore, Mandla and Balaghat, and also in the towns of Hoshangabad, Harda and Burhanpur during the season, a note regard- ing which has already been forwarded. 25. The inspection work of vaccination made by the Civil Surgeons and Native Superintendents was on the whole satisfactory. 26.

Statement showing the number of calves vaccinated, and the cost incurred in connection with the cultivation of animal lymph, together with the numbers vaccinated with the lymph:NOTE ON VACCINATION IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES FOR THE SEASON 1896-97: BY SURGEON COLONEL G. HUTCHESON, M. D., OFFG SANITARY COMMISSIONER. PRINTED AT THE SECRETARIAT PRESS, 1897. [PRICE ONE RUPEE.]
No. 7517. Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner, Central Provinces, in the General Department, dated Nagpur, the 29th September 1897. READ2 It is observed that in the columns showing total population the population of Zamindaris in which no work was done has been excluded. This is incorrect. Zamindaris are as much British territory as any other part of the Provinces, and the Department is responsible for carrying on work in them as fully as in the Khalsa. No part of the Provinces should be left without the protection afforded by vaccination, or regarded as outside the area for which the District Medical Officer is responsible. 3. In the exceptional conditions which prevailed it is not worth while examining closely the statistics of the several districts. In spite of the adverse circumstances of the year, eight districts show an increase in the number of primary vaccinations performed. Except Saugor and Betul, these were all districts which suffered only slightly from distress. In Saugor the recovery, 13 per cent., follows upon a much 'larger falling off,34 per cent., in the previous year. 4. The proportion of successful primary cases verified as such among those seen by Civil Surgeons (91.70) and Superintendents (92.78) was considerably larger than last year, when it was given as 87.62 and 91.01 respectively, which result may be considered satisfactory. Of the total number vaccinated 18.09 Per cent. were seen by Civil Surgeons and 49.32 by Superintendents as compared with 18.58 and 51.13 in the preceding year. The percentage of cases inspected by the Civil Surgeon (1.78) was exceptionally low in Sambalpur, and as this district was not afflicted by famine, a larger amount of inspection was to be expected. 5. Animal lymph supplied the bulk of the vaccination and worked very successfully. There seems to be no prejudice worth notice against its use in these Provinces. Betul appears to be the district in which the lymph used was least successful, two supplies having failed before vaccination was thoroughly established by means of lymph procured from Bangalore. The Sanitary Com- missioner rightly directs attention to the great importance of seeing that operations are in all cases carried out with thoroughly efficient lymph, a point which specially requires the attention of the Civil Surgeons. 6. The Chief Commissioner is indebted to the Sanitary Commissioner for careful examination of vaccination work. He observes that in some districts it is not as efficient as it might be. The approaching season will, the Chief Commissioner trusts, enable the steady progress which has been temporarily interrupted to be resumed, though the falling off in the infant population caused by the effects of famine cannot be expected to be repaired for some time to come.

Owing (a) to scarcity and widespread distress among the general popula- tion, (b) to the falling off in the number of births, and (c) to the emigration of the people from their villages while in search of employment or the means of sub- sistence, the operations of the Vaccination Department have been considerably restricted during the past as compared with former seasons. Besides a number of Native Superintendents of Vaccination and a considerable proportion of the Vaccination Establishment were employed on famine, cholera and plague duty during the season, and such causes tended to limit the field of operations. It may be here stated, also, that the returns from the Feudatory States of Bamra and Sonepur were not received in time to be incorporated in the general returns. Establishment. 2. The strength of the Provincial and Feudatory State Vaccination Establishments is noted below : 2 5. Primary vaccinations numbered 352,794 against 383,556, and re-vaccina- tions 44,242 against 66,164 during the previous season. The decline in primary vaccinations in the Provinces, excluding the figures of Feudatory States, was about 8 per cent. 6. The decline in operations was due to general privation and the unhealthi- ness of the year, and to a decrease in the number of births and increase in the deaths of children. The birth-rate of 1896 reached the minimum rate recorded during the past 15 years, and the decrease in the number of births occurred in fourteen districts. The withdrawal of Vaccinators for epidemic duty during the working season also affected the results, as previously noted. 7. The percentage of successful primary cases was 96.20 against 96.37, and that of re-vaccinations was 77.68 as compared with 82.11 in the previous year. The following table shows the percentage of success claimed to have been obtained by the Vaccinators, and as checked by Native Superintendents and Civil Surgeons:3 11. As regards primary vaccinations, eight districts showed an increase and 10 a decrease. The decrease varied from 5,593 in Balaghat to 715 in Hosh- angabad, and the increase from 33 in Chanda to 1,732 in Saugor. 12. The following table shows the difference in the number of primary operations performed by Provincial Vaccinators during seasons 1895-96 and 1896-97:4 Re-vaccination. 15. There has been a large decrease under the head &quot; Re-vaccination&quot;, which may be in part due to the orders issued on the subject. Vaccinators are frequently tempted to perform re-vaccination more frequently than necessary with a view to supplement their record, when the number of primary operations falls short of the average. This practice has been discouraged of late years. STATEMENT No. II. 16. The total cost of the Provincial Vaccination Department amounted to Rs. 40,535-0-10 against Rs. 41,610-4-10 in 1895-96, or Rs. 1,075-4-0 less. The decrease occurred chiefly under the heads &quot;Establishment&quot; and &quot;Travelling Allowance.&quot; The decrease under the former head was due to the retirement from the service of Native Superintendents and dismissal of Vaccinators of the higher grades, their places being taken by juniors on less pay ; and under the latter head to less travelling allowance having been drawn by Civil Surgeons. 17. The average cost of each successful case of vaccination for the year was Re. 0-2-1 2/5 against Re. 0-1-11 in 1895-96. The increase is due to a decrease in the number of successful operations performed by the Vaccinators owing to causes already indicated. 18. The total cost of the Vaccination Establishment of the Feudatory States exclusive of Makrai, Bamra and Sonepur for the year amounted to Rs. 6,171-7-11 against Rs. 4,567-9-11 in 1895-96, or Rs. 1,603-14-0 more. This increase is chiefly due to the inclusion in the statements of the cost of carrying on vaccina- tion in the Bastar State (Rs. 1,708-2-11). 19. The average cost of each successful operation was Re. 0-1-5 1/3 against Re. 0-0-11 1/2 in the previous year. 20. The total amount expended during the year in the Central Provinces and in the Feudatory States was Rs. 46,706-8-9 against Rs. 46,177-14-9, or Rs. 528-10-0 more than in 1895-96. 21. The average cost of each successful case of vaccination was Re. 0-2-0 against Re. 0-1-9 in the previous season. STATEMENT No. III. 22. The total number of operations performed by Hospital Assistants attached to dispensaries, both in the Central Provinces and in Feudatory States, was 16,773 against 15,755, or 1,018 more than in the previous season. Fifteen thousand and twenty-seven were primary operations and 1,746 re-vaccinations, and 8,959 were successful primary operations on infants under one year of age. 23. The Dispensary Vaccination Return for the Narsinghpur District was blank. It is stated that a Municipal Vaccinator was employed to perform vacci- nation in Narsinghpur and Gadarwara towns. STATEMENT No. IV. 24. The total number of operations and the number successfully vaccinated were considerably less than in the previous season.
5 Inspection. 25. The following table shows the inspection work accomplished by Civil Surgeons, and Native Superintendents of Vacci- nation :6 26. Provincial.7 31. Saugor.8 47. Bilaspur.9 General Remarks. 52. The Inspector-General of Education issued a Circular letter to Inspec- tors of Schools, asking them to enforce with &quot; greater strictness &quot; the conditions of Articles 101 (c) and 268 of the Educational Code. He has asked them to ascer- tain whether students are vaccinated or not on the occasion of examination in gymnastics, &c., and when passing them for grants. 53. Vaccinators frequently allege as an excuse for short work that the people are averse to vaccination. This may be true to a slight extent; but the opposition in these Provinces is not of a pronounced nature. 54. It may be stated from personal observation of the season's operations in the Nagpur, Chhindwara, Betul, Hoshangabad, Narsinghpur, Saugor, Damoh and Jubbulpore Districts, and inspections in the Sadar Stations of Khandwa, Mandla, Seoni and elsewhere, that the results vary very much in different districts, and in some districts vaccination is not altogether efficient. In the south-western portion of the Chhindwara District the results were particularly favourable, but in the Betul District indifferent. In some parts of the Betul District the lymph in use was imperfect and had been so for some time, and a renewal of the lymph was urgently needed and had to be arranged for forthwith. 55. On the whole, fair progress has been made in these Provinces, but further effective supervision of operations, and careful attention to the quality of lymph in use, by Civil Surgeons are necessary. The general health of the people in many districts was unfavourable, and the falling off in vaccination, though not so serious as might have been expected, may be fairly ascribed to the distressed and vagrant condition of the poorer classes, and concurrently to adverse conditions affecting the birth-rate, and infantile life generally, during an exceptionally bad season, when great privation deepened into famine in the northern, central and other districts.

READ2 4 As regards the Feudatory States there has been a marked improvement generally; though in 1898-99 there was a decline in the number of secondary operations. With reference to the remark of the Sanitary Commissioner in paragraphs 4 and 19 of the Report that primary vaccination is of more import- ance than re-vaccination, the Chief Commissioner would call attention to a consideration which is not without weight when an ignorant population is being dealt with. It is that cases of small-pox attacking a vaccinated person diminish confidence in vaccination and discourage people from submitting their children to it. 5. The number of children under one year of age vaccinated in the year 1898-99, as compared with the number shown as available, was as follows:3 ORDER.TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES FOR THE YEAR 1898-99. Reason for delay in sub- mitting the Report. IN forwarding the following Report, I have the honour to state that the delay in its preparation and submission has been due to the fact that the information, required from the Feudatory States, was not received complete until the 7th July 1899, not- withstanding repeated reminders on the point by letter and telegram. I would also add that, in dealing with the matter in hand, I labour under the disadvantage of having no personal knowledge of the subject, as regards the Central Provinces, having assumed charge of this office only a few weeks ago, and therefore, not having been present during any portion of the period under review. 2. From the following Statement it will be seen that Vaccination Establishment. the Establishment remains the same as that of the preced- ing year:2 1896-97. 1897-98. 1898-99. Difference of operations between 1897-98 and 1898-99. By Provincial Dispensary Establishment :3 Persons successfully vacci- nated per 1,000 of population. 10. The number of persons successfully vaccinated, per 1,000 of population, was 31.70 against 28.39 for the preceding year. The protection against small-pox thus represented, taking into consideration the difference between the present actual and nominal population, is probably not less than that for 1895-96 when the figure was 34.83. Total operations in the Khalsa. 11 Excluding the returns from Native States, the entire number of primary operations was 294,289, being 26,018 above that of 1897-98, while the re-vaccinations show rise of 13,872, the total increase being 39,890. Successful primary opera- tions on infants. 12. The successful primary operations performed on infants under one year of age during the last five years are shown as follows :4 first Medical Officers concerned. The Civil Medical Officer of Wardha attributes the decrease to there having been 4,863 births less in 1898 than in 1897, and to rumours having been circulated that Vaccinators were mixing plague serum with their vaccine lymph. The Civil Surgeon of Chanda states &quot;very considerable &quot; difficulty was experienced in carrying out vaccination this season. Report after &quot; report with long lists of names came from the Vaccinators of parents who had &quot; refused to have their children vaccinated. The reports were far more frequent &quot; than in previous years. Dread of plague inoculation may have had something &quot; to do with it; but as the better class people were the chief offenders, it is more &quot; than likely that this was merely given as an excuse for evading vaccination which &quot; is by no means popular. It is strongly recommended that vaccination be made &quot;compulsory. In each case of refusal the Tahsildar was appealed to, usually with &quot; satisfactory result. In the village of Marora, near Mul, the Vaccinators were &quot; treated in a very threatening manner. &quot; In the passage above quoted the state- ment that &quot; in each case of refusal the Tahsildar was appealed to, usually with satisfactory result,&quot; appears to me rather inconsistent with the fact of the large minus figure5 TABLE II.

With regard to re-vaccination it is laid down in Government of India let- ter No. 301, dated 24th October 1894, to the Chief Commis- sioner, Central Provinces, that &quot; such operations should, the &quot;Government of India are advised, be restricted to (1) child- &quot; ren on whom marks of previous year's operations are doubtful: and (2) adolescents &quot;or adults on whom it is desirable to re-inforce the protection afforded in infancy.&quot; At the same time a caution is added with a view to preventing Vaccinators from resorting to re-vaccination merely for the sake of swelling their returns. 19. It is obvious that the more carefully and successfully the primary oper- ation is carried out the smaller will be the number of children coming under class (1). Regarding class (2) I am not aware of any scientific data on which a definite period can be fixed in which the protective effects of successful vaccination expire, but I believe it is generally considered advisable to repeat the operation every seven years, although I fear such a measure would be impracticable in India. While deprecating any approach to coercive means, I consider it advisable that adolescents and adults who have not had small-pox and who either present unsatis- factory marks of primary vaccination or with whom a long period has elapsed since the operation was performed, should be encouraged to submit to re-vaccina- tion. At the same time Vaccinators should be given to understand that the primary operation is the more important of the two and that its neglect cannot be compen- sated for by the performance of the secondary. While the two measures are shown in separate columns, I do not think that, under the above circumstances, the evil alluded to need be much apprehended. Re vaccination in the Khalsa. 20. The number of re-vaccinations performed during 1898-99 amounted to 52,274, being 13,872 in excess of that for 1897-98 and greater by 18,918 than the figures for 1896-97. In Damoh, Balaghat and Raipur the operation does not appear to have been resorted to at all. In none of these instances has any explanation been given by the Medical Officers concerned. On the other hand the Civil Medical Officer of Betul, the district in which the greatest increase, as compared with the previous year, has taken place, states &quot; the amount of re-vaccination done this year is very &quot; high. During my tour I found very old people are re-vaccinated. People who &quot; had small-pox before had also to undergo re-vaccination.&quot; I have enquired whether, by the above, he means that coercive measures were resorted to, and been informed that such was not the case. Total number of opera- tions in Feudatory States and the success claimed by Vaccinators. 21. In the Feudatory States, vaccination operations are not as strictly super- vised as in the Khalsa, the Civil Surgeons who visit the former only doingso when they can spare time from their substantive duties. At present a scheme is under consideration for the pe- riodical and more frequent medical inspection of these States.
6 22. The total number of primary and re-vaccinations, performed in the States, amounted to 76,743 and 11,868 respectively, being an increase of 11,121 in the former and a decrease of 313 in the latter, as compared with 1897-98. 23. The average percentage of success claimed by Vaccinators is 92.86, which is reduced to 89.83 by Civil Surgeons in those cases in which they checked the results. The figure given by Superintendents is 95.02, so that the operations appear to have been conducted with a fair amount of care. The lowest number of primary vaccinations was 186 in Makrai. Annual mortality from small-pox for seven years and the annual proportion of persons protected by vacci- nation. 24. With reference to para. 9 of the memorandum of the Army Sanitary Commission on the Report of the Sanitary Commissioner, Central Provinces, for 1890, the following table is appended :7 27. In the Feudatory States the total cost was Rs.6,757-13-7, a decrease of Rs.27-13-0 which does not seem to call for special notice. The average cost of each successful case was Re.0-1-3 5/7, a decrease of 1 13/21 pies. TABLE IV. 1896-97. 1897-98. 1898-99. 1896-97. 1897-98. 1898-99. Pay of estab- lishment. Travelling allowance.

8 STATEMENT III. Operations performed by Hospital Assistants. 28. There were 14,076 Dispensary vaccinations (including re-vaccination) in the Khalsa and Feudatory States, of which 12,339 were performed in the former and 1,737 in the latter, showing an increase of 493 and decrease of 640 respectively. The falling off in the Bastar State is attributed to the fact of the Hospital Assistants having neglected this part of their duties, and it is stated that on these grounds the services of four of them were dispensed with. No explanation has been offered from the other States. No operations were performed at the Branch Dispensary of Lakhnadon in the Seoni district, the reason given by the Civil Medical Officer being that the Hospital Assistant had been put in additional charge of the Poor-house, and on this account had been relieved of vaccination duties. The vaccine operations performed by each Hospital Assistant in 1896-97, 1897-98 and 1898-99 are shown in the following table :9 TABLE V.10 TABLE V.II STATEMENT IV. Number of persons pri- marily vaccinated and the number successfully vacci- nated since 1867. 29. Is a comparative one, indicating the number of persons primarily vac- cinated and those successfully in different years extend- ing as far back as 1867. The figures for the period under review show a satisfactory result. Sources of lymph. 30. In the Appendix is shown the number of calves vaccinated and the cost incurred in this connection, together with the numbers vacci- nated from this source. 31. During the non-working portion of the year the supply of lymph was kept up at District Head-quarters principally by arm-to-arm vaccination, and when the vaccination season commenced it was issued to Vaccinators in the form of lanoline and vaseline paste, and by them propagated in calves. A trial was also made of glycerinated lymph, but the results were unsatisfactory and not in accord- ance with those alleged to have been obtained in other countries, as stated in a report of the Royal Commission on Vaccination reproduced in the British Medical Journal of 21st August 1897, a copy of which was circulated to Civil Surgeons from this office. The virus, when freshly issued in this medium, appears to be fairly active, but evidently soon deteriorates probably due to the introduction of other organisms from want of scientific cleanliness in carrying out the method of preparation. I do not recommend a repetition of the experiment and consider that the present mode of vaccinating direct from the calf is the most effectual yet tried. In some districts a certain amount of difficulty was experienced in obtaining animals, but in nearly all cases it was overcome. STATEMENT V. Inspection of operations. 32. This statement shows the particulars of vaccina- tion verified by Inspecting Officers. In the Nagpur district, formerly, an Assistant Surgeon was deputed to check the results of vaccination, but, during the past year, on account of the exist- ence of plague in the Provinces, an official of this class could not be spared for the purpose, and as the time of the Civil Surgeon was fully occupied with other duties the entry in the column remains blank. 33. In all other districts in the Khalsa inspections were performed by Medi- cal Officers and Superintendents. The total number of vaccinations checked by the former amounting to 69,318 and in individual cases varying from a maximum of 9,421 (Sambalpur) to a minimum of 1,185 (Mandla). As regards Superin- tendents, the respective numbers were 190,333, 27,692, 3,087. 34. Proceeding to the percentage of success thus ascertained, the total aver- age for the Khalsa is 89.02 by Civil Surgeons, 91.56 by Superintendents and 96.82 claimed by Vaccinators. In the first two instances the success must, to a large extent, be judged from the resulting cicatrix and not from the appearance of the vesicles, as also from a limited number of the children vaccinated Taking these facts into consideration, the difference in the figures is not remarkable. As I have already stated, the district of Betul shows the lowest percentage of success12 35. The usual inspection table is given below :13 The inspections by the Civil Surgeons seem on the whole to have been car- ried out in a satisfactory manner. Owing to the outbreak of plague in Wardha the Civil Medical Officer spent only five days in camp. Municipalities in which the Vaccination Act is in force. 36.
