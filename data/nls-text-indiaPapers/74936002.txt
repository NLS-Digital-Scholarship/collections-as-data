Edinburgh IP/32/MB3 REPORT OF THE LAHORE MEDICAL SCHOOL HOSPITAL FOR THE YEAR 1867. During the past year, no remarkable changes or improvements have been made in the hospital. It has been found necessary, however, to apply for an additional ward, as the old wards have been, during a part of the year, quite insufficient for the number of patients. The month of October is the most sickly month at Lahore amongst the natives, and our hospital, which is adapted for 48 patients, was crowded with upwards of 80. Happily the long required new hospital has at last been sanctioned; so that, if the work be now pushed on, it will perhaps be unnecessary to go to, any further expense with the old one. The total number of in-patients admitted during the year was 1073,( 2 ) Stone. Stone in the Bladder.( 5 ) One single vesicle was now noticed on the right ala of the nose, and another on the right side of the lower lip. The inflammation of the forehead and face was begin- ning to subside, and on the 13th many of the vesicles had dried up. The nebula on the cornea gradually diminished, but had not disappeared at the time of his discharge on the 27th; no ulceration followed, nor was there any iritis. The iris, however, was kept well dilated with atropine. He suffered from severe neuralgic pain of the forehead for many days after the subsidence of the eruption, although the vesicles had all healed, and nothing but cicatrices remained. This was relieved somewhat by the local application of Tincture of Aconite.

Another interesting case was the formation of an artificial anus in a child 3 days old, who had congenital deficiency of the reetum. I could not find the gut by incision in the natural situation, and therefore opened the descending colon in the left loin. The parents would not keep the child in the hospital, and we have no report later than the afternoon of the same day, when meconium, was still passing freely through the artificial opening.

Number of passed stu- dents. The Medical School, during the last year, has undergone but few changes. Suc- cessive Annual Reports have recorded its history, its mode of working, and its numbers, year by year; and last year a brief review was taken of its progress since its first establishment. Up to the 31st March, 1867, we had passed six Sub-Assistant Surgeons and 51 Native Doctors, and in last report, I expressed a hope that we should shortly pass 4 more Sub-Assistant Surgeons, and 20 more Native Doctors. This hope was fulfilled. In April, 1867, we passed 16 Native Doctors, in July 4, in all 20, making the total number, since the opening of the School in 1860, a period of nearly 8 years, 71. In July, we passed 4 Sub-Assistant Surgeons, making a total of 10 since the opening of the School. The names of these men were Sahib Ditta, Bhawanee Dass, Jaswunt Roy and Haranchunder Banerjee. The first of these men, Sahib Ditta, is now House Surgeon to the Medical School Hospital, Bhawanee Dass is in charge of the Dispensary at Rawulpindi, Jas- wunt Roy at Jugadri, and Haranchunder Banerjee at Loodiana. All I believe are doing well. Number of the English Class. 2. The total number of the English class students at present is 21, a few having dropped off since the beginning of the year. Such fluctuations are only temporary; they are common to all educational institu- tions, for it always happens that a certain number of those who commence their studies lack either the health or the perseverance to continue them to the end. The full number of this class allowed by Government up to the beginning of last official year was 25, for whom a monthly sum of Rs. 275 was granted for scholarships and stipends. Local students of the Eng- lish class. 3. In April last the Supreme Government gave their sanction to the admission of fifteen more students, making the complement forty; but, as no more money was granted for scholarships, the limit has prac- tically continued to be twenty-five, as before. An effort, how- ever, is now being made to obtain the additional 15 men from the different districts of the Punjab, as local students, whose education is to be paid for by the districts, at the rate of Rs. 15 per mensem; from this, scholarships and stipends will be provided on the same scale as to the Government students, the remainder being applied towards defraying the various contingent expenses of the School. Already I have had some applications from candidates for admission on these terms in October next. These men will of course sign an agreement that they will return to their own districts to practise, and that, if they leave the Medical School without permission of the Principal, they will refund to the Deputy Commissioner of their district the whole of the money paid by him for their education. Number of the Hindus- tani class. 4. The complement of Government students of the Hindustani class is still 60, and their actual number at present 57, besides which we have 18 local students, in all 75. These local students come from the following districts, and in the following numbers from each,( 2 ) the demand will steadily increase; and though we might reckon easily at the present moment the places in the Punjab for which medical men are required, I believe that the necessities of the country, the march of intellect, and the advancement of science, will create demands in this province, and all over India, which the present Medical Schools will be barely able to meet. When I say the advancement of science, I mean especially Sanitary Science, but let it be remembered that scientific men are greatly wanted to in- vestigate the as yet unexplored resources of this great country, and it is to the ranks of the Medical profession that Government always looks for Botanists, for Chemists and for Naturalists, while to afford professional advice to the population, solely in the matter of their health, would require more medical men than have yet been supplied by all the Medical Schools in India. The Sub-Assistant Surgeons and Native Doctors that have gone out from here, inform me continually of the numerous cases of disease which, for want of Medical men with the necessary appliances, lie absolutely neglected. This is perhaps more obvious in cases of blindness than in any others. Such are exceedingly nu- merous in the Punjab, and in none is the skilful hand of the educated Surgeon more necessary, or more powerful to relieve, while in none is the Yunani system of medicine more completely helpless. Its advantage during Cho- lera epidemics. 6. Perhaps the advantage of this School which, in the beginning, was so much opposed, ridiculed and calumniated by jealous lookers on, has never been more signally shown than during epidemics of Cholera, The last epidemic broke out, about this time last year, when we had just passed a number of fresh Native Doctors; and these men became at once in such request, that none of them could be granted leave, as is usual after passing their final examination, but they were immediately despatched by the quickest possible modes of conveyance to the various scenes of the epidemic, and it was in a great measure due to the soundness of their knowledge, to their excellent working habits, acquired in this institu- tion, and to their acceptableness to their own countrymen, that the plague visited us with so much less severity than in former years. 7. I am happy to be able to report the commencement of the long wished for Hospital, which had indeed become a great necessity. The healing art, on European principles, is daily becoming better known, and more people are daily flocking to the Capital for the purpose of obtaining medical advice, Thus it frequently happens that our present building, which ought to hold about 48 patients, is crowded to excess, to the great detriment of all concerned: this, however, is noticed more particularly in the Hospital report appended hereto (Appendix B).* Complimentary letter re- ceived from the University of Dublin. 8. The great event of the year I hold to be the acknowledgment of the efforts of the Punjab Government in the cause of science by the Senate of the University of Dublin, who hold out encouragement to our students to go home and take degrees in Dublin. I give below (Appendix A) a letter from the Medical Registrar of that University received in Decem- ber last. It obviously does not promise a complete recognition, seeing that this is accord- ed only to the Irish Schools and to the Medical School of Edinburgh; but the purport of the letter evidently is to offer our men privileges similar to those granted to students from the English Schools Who have not passed the College of Surgeons of England. An offer of this kind, coming at the same time with the establishment of the Gilchrist scholar- ships, will I hope stimulate the Punjabees to still further exertion; and I trust that the time is not far distant when some of them will travel to Europe, and prove to the Home Universities that we have men to instruct who deserve encouragement, and who are not far behind, either in ability, energy or professional attainments, the alumni of the mother country. * Printed separately.

(3) Appendix A. COPY of a letter from the Medical Registrar of the University of Dublin, to J. B. Scriven, Esquire, Principal, Lahore Medical School, dated School of Physic, Trinity College, Dublin, 2nd November, 1867. I received your letter of the 16th September last, respecting the recognition of the Lahore Medical School by the University of Dublin. We do not directly recognise any Medical School, except that of the University of Edinburgh, and we indirectly recog- nise the Schools accepted by the College of Surgeons of England, by admitting the mem- bers of that College to examination, on passing the arts examination, for our license in medicine. The University could not therefore directly recognise the Lahore Medical School, but I am certain that in any individual case, if it came before the Board, they would be most willing to deal liberally with a student of the Lahore School, and allow him every reasonable privilege. Your success, under disadvantageous circumstances, is most creditable to those who have worked up the School to its present condition.
IP/32/MB.3 IP Edin REPORT OF THE LAHORE MEDICAL SCHOOL FOR THE YEAR. ENDING 31ST MARCH, 1869. Eight years and a half have now elapsed since the establishment of the Lahore Medical School. Its progress has been steady, though often in the face of considerable difficulties, and I am happy, this year, to be able still to report favourably of its success. Number of passed men. 2. During the past year we have sent out six Sub-Assistant Surgeons and 20 Native Doctors, making the total of the former class 16 and of the latter 91, since the establishment of the institution. We hope, before August, to add to these five Sub-Assistant Surgeons, and 19 Native Doctors, making the total of both classes 131, during the first nine years of our existence. Number and progress of English class. 3. The number of the English class at present is 30, of whom two are local students, from Amritsar and Jhung. This class gives very satisfactory evidence of the spread of general education in the Punjab; for, year by year, we find the students' progress, during the first session, better than in former years; thus proving that our success is not due to ourselves alone, but in great part also to the efforts made by the Educational Department, in teaching Eng- lish, and to the zeal and aptitude of the population in acquiring it. Number of Hindustani class. 4. The Hindustani class at present numbers 73, of whom 23 are local students, from Lahore, Syalkot, Hoshiarpore, Gurdaspore, Jullundhur, and Rawulpindi. Local students. 5. The local students are increasing steadily, though slowly. Those of the English class are a new institution. The main obstacle to their rapid increase appears to be the want of means to provide, not for their education, but for their payment, after they become Sub-Assistant Surgeons and Native Doctors, which of course it is necessary for a Deputy Commissioner to con- sider well, before he sends men to be educated here. The difficulties of providing this, in prospectu, seem to have been much increased of late, by the removal of some of the sources from which local funds were formerly replenished. I am quite sure that a Go- vernment guarantee to the payment of local students that pass their final examination. successfully would greatly increase confidence in this most useful branch of the service. Advantages of educating local students. 6. The local students I consider to be a most important class, for they agree to return to their own districts, and their own friends and relations will thus profit by their education, and will see the advan- tages gained, and be the more ready to be influenced by those whom they have known from their childhood, and to appreciate the benefits they have learnt to confer upon the inhabitants of their native places. But a still further advantage is gained by educating these local students, inasmuch as many of them are the sons or relatives of Hakims, already understanding a little of Yunani Medicine; so that we are thus able to graft western science upon eastern practical knowledge. Eastern and western systems thus combined. 7. The education of these young Hakims, in fact, appears to me to be the only effective way of combining the two systems. A Hakim, skill- ed in his own system, has, of course, acquired a good deal of practical knowledge, and is acquainted with a number of Indian Medicines, to us com- paratively unknown; but there is much, nevertheless, that is based on a wrong founda- tion, which a man, that has grown old in his profession, finds it difficult to throw aside, while the difficulty of acquiring a new science is still greater.
( 2 ) Seven local students about to pass. 8. For the first time seven of these local students are about to present them- selves this very month for their final examination as Native Doctors, and we hope, therefore, shortly to learn how far the experiment has succeeded. Additional allowance for Scholarships granted. 9. It is satisfactory to find that the more men we pass, the greater is the demand for them. A short time ago the number of our English class was limited to 25. Now, however, the Supreme Government have, of their own accord, given us an additional grant of Rs. 165 per mensem, for scholarships and stipends, with the view of increasing this class to 40; and, as it already numbers 30, I hope the next matriculation examination in October will give us the full number required. Change in the educational staff. 10. A change in the educational staff of the Medical School has taken place during the past official year, due to the abolition of the post of Garrison Assistant Surgeon, and consequent removal of Dr. Neil, who was also Professor of Anatomy and Physiology. I have therefore undertaken Physiology, and Anatomy is very effectively taught by Muhammad Hussain Khan, who was educated, as Sub-Assistant Surgeon, at this institution, and was employed, even before he attained this rank, in teaching Anatomy to the Hindustani class. New Hospital progressing rapidly. 11. I am happy to be able to add that the Medical School Hospital, now in course of erection, is progressing rapidly, and promises to be not only a commodious, but an exceedingly imposing edifice, built on the most liberal scale, and on the most approved principles of modern sanatory science. Income and expenditure. 12. Appended hereto is a statement of income and expenditure during the past official year. J. B. SCRIVEN, Principal, Lahore Medical School.

REPORT ON THE LAHORE MEDICAL SCHOOL For the year 1879( 2 ) (6).( 3 ) 10. But one of the new students from the North( 4 ) 14. After 1st January, 1 of the 2nd-year paid students from the North- Western Provinces left to prosecute his studies in England and his scholarship was transferred to the only free student of the 1st year from the same Province. 15. But during February 3 new students with scholarships arrived. from the North-Western Provinces, and 1 free student from the same Pro- vinces; so that there was an addition of 3 pupils, and the number of students. on the 1st of April 1880 was 53, who were thus divided:( 5 ) 19. During April 15 medical pupils of the 4th year passed their final examination, also 1 Hakim student, and 3 of the local students, and all left the School. One of the medical pupils of the second year died; 1 of the third - year medical pupils, 1 of the second year, and 1 of the fourth year were dismissed; also one of the first-year students absconded; and 1 local student was discharged, making a loss of 25 students removed from the School. On the 1st of May 8 medical pupils were admitted, 11 Hakim students, 2 Punjab University students, 1 Mission student, and 15 local students, making a total of 37 new students, and a total increase of 12 students; so that on June 1st the number of students were arranged as follows:( 6 ) 21. From the above statement it appears that the medical pupils have been greatly diminished in number; only 8 have been received last year instead of 25 who came in the year previous, and a letter from the Surgeon-General Indian Medical Department, states that only 6 will be sent during the year 1880. A much larger number could be taught at the Medical School to become Hospital Assistants if necessary. It is also evident that there were altogether 101 pupils present on the 1st of April 1879, and that 39 were admitted during the year, making altogether 140 pupils, of whom 21 passed their final examination successfully, 1 died, and 28 were dismissed for various causes, making a loss of 50 students and reducing the total number to 90. But, while of the 74 medical pupils 17 passed their final examination, 1 died and 9 were discharged, out of the 24 Hakim students only 1 passed his final exami- nation successfully and 9 were dismissed; while of the local students, 35 in number, 3 passed, 1 left from ill-health and 9 were dismissed. The proportion of Hakim and local students dismissed is much larger than that of the Military Class; but this is occasioned partly by the fact that the Military Class spend a year in employment at the regimental hospitals or civil dispensaries, during which time many of the more incompetent or unsuitable are removed before they come to the Medical School; and, secondly, the competition for the students is more limited in the Hakim and local classes, since the former are restricted to the relatives of Hakims and the latter to the inhabitants of a peculiar district; but one of the principal causes is that the future prospects of Hakims and local students are less favorable than those of the Military Class, since the former receive no pay when their education is completed and the latter depend for their remuneration on the local committees of their respective districts; hence they are more easily dissatisfied with their studies, and often cease to learn and thus become dismissed. 22. Arrangement of the teaching in the Medical School. 1st.( 7 ) 27. After three years' study the students pass their junior examination in Medicine, and then study for two years more the following subjects:( 8 ) lectures on Midwifery, also given by Amir Shah; but there is but little oppor- tunity-of illustrating these lectures, as very few midwifery cases come to the Mayo Hospital. 41. Admission of Students.( 9 ) 44. Seven candidates also presented themselves for admission into the English Class as local students; and these were also examined in English and Urdu with the following results:( 10 ) 46. Although only one of the students obtained half marks in the two subjects, yet, if the Urdu alone is considered, it would appear that five of the students each gained half the marks in this subject, and to these and the one who obtained 40 marks in English the scholarships were given. 47. There was also a competition for the local students of the Hindustani Class, at which 15 candidates came for examination in Urdu. One of these had passed the Punjab University Matriculation, and received a scholarship with- out further examination; but the rest were examined in the Urdu language with the following results:( 11 ) performance of surgical operations on the dead body as well as a viva voce examination on these subjects. 52. The final examination of the Hindustani Class takes place in April of the third year of residence, and consists of a vivâ voce examination in the four subjects of Anatomy, Materia Medica, Surgery and Medicine by the English Professors of the School, each in one or two subjects, assisted by the Native teachers. Afterwards the students are again examined in the same subjects by all the Professors together with the Surgeon-General, and reference is made to the marks obtained in the previous examination. The Hakím students are also examined in Midwifery and Chemistry in the same manner. 53. List of Examiners.( 12 ) 55.

From this table it will be seen that only those students who obtained more than half the marks were granted scholarships, and that the two highest students obtained two-thirds of the marks. The results of the examination in July 1878 were included, as the scholarships were awarded partly in conse- quence of the marks gained at the time; but the same studentswere again examined in July 1879, with the following results:( 13 ) 57. From this it will be seen that most of these students have improved considerably during their second summer session at the School, excepting Gián Chand, who left the School, and Mohandro Lal and Srikrishan Sahai, both of whom were sick at the time of examination. During this session C. C. Caleb surpassed all the other students; but this pupil has subsequently left the Medi- cal School in order to pursue his studies in England, and his scholarship has been awarded to another student. Ajudhia Patti had somewhat improved, but had not yet obtained half marks. During this summer session the follow- ing students obtained half the marks given: Lalu Ram, Shankar Lal, C. C. Caleb, Hori Lal, and Ram Charan; while Mahomed Latuíf and Ajudhia Patti obtained very nearly half marks, which was an improvement on the previous examination. Lalu Ram, Shankar Lal and C. C. Caleb obtained two-thirds of the total number of marks given, and the two former did so during the previous year also. 58. 2nd-year Students.( 14 ) 60. It thus appears that during the previous summer months all the students, with the exception of one, obtained half the number of full marks, and all with the exception of two students did so during the winter session. Only two of the students, Guran Ditta and Tarak Nath, obtained two-thirds of the total marks, both during the summer examination and in all the year; and. Guran Ditta alone, who is a singularly clever and painstaking student, ob- tained three-fourths of the total marks both during the summer and winter sessions. 61. The same students were examined in July 1879 in the same subjects as during the previous year, and obtained the following marks:( 15 ) 65. From this it will be seen that six of the candidates obtained half the number of marks, and the seventh was only one mark below half the total number, but was not allowed to pass, as he failed in Anatomy and Chemistry. Bishamber Nath and Nihal Chand were rejected, and Vidya Nath also failed in Anatomy. The first three students gained two-thirds of the total number of marks, and the first student, Nil Rattan Banerji, three-fourths of the total amount. 66. The fourth-year students were examined in the senior subjects, and they passed an examination in July 1878 as well as April 1879, the marks of both of which were employed to determine their scholarships, and are therefore included in this Report:( 16 ) 69. The 5th-year students underwent a final examination partly in April 1879 and partly in July,(17) 72. It thus appears that 7 out of the 13 students obtained half marks, and that all the students gained at least 33 per cent., which is satisfactory considering that they had only studied these subjects for three months; further, three of the students obtained two-thirds of, the total amount; these were Baldeo Singh, Sripat Sahai and Mathra Pershad, who appear to be very intelligent students. 73. Civil Medical Pupils.( 18 ) number. Of the students who were remanded, two subsequently passed the final examination. 77. Only one Hakim student presented himself for examination at this time. He obtained the following marks:( 19 ) 81. From this it will be seen that 11 of the students out of 24 obtained half the marks, but only 3 gained two-thirds of the marks; the best student, Broma Nand, obtained more than five-sixths of the total number, and was first in each subject with the exception of Surgery. Most of the failures occurred in Anatomy, in which only 8 students obtained half the number of marks given, and in Surgery, in which only 7 gained half the full number of marks. The 2 students who stood lowest on the list were dismissed. 82. Hakim Class.( 20 ) From this it appears that neither of the two students obtained one quarter of the full marks which were awarded. 86.

Only two of these obtained half marks, and these two gained a less number than the first and second students of the Hakim class of the same year. None of these students, however, obtained less than one quarter of the marks given. 91. There was only one Mission student admitted this year, who obtained the following marks:( 22 ) The following prizes were awarded by the Professors of the School:( 23 ) 94. In the Hindustani Class the following prizes were given by the teachers of the class in consultation with the Principal of the School:( 24 ) 96. Of these students, some belong to the English Class and others to the Hindustani Class. In the former there are( 25 ) the lectures regularly for at least three years, were selected to pass a final examination before Doctor Scriven, the Professor of Midwifery, and Doctor Brown, the Principal of the Medical School. Five of them appeared at this examination and passed very successfully. The 6th was prevented from appearing, as she had given birth to a child during the previous week. These women will be of great service in attending their country-women and also the poorer class of Eurasians and Europeans. 100. Honors to former Students of the School.( 26 ) Of these 13 subjects were obtained from the Central Jail, 14 from the Lunatic Asylum, and 145 from the Mayo Hospital. During the year 1878-79 there were no less than 376 subjects available, showing an increase of 204 over the number of the past year. 104.

The following abstract shows the attendance in the Lower or Hindustani Class of students:( 31 ) 9. Fifteen of the recently-passed Assistant Surgeons on the Punjab establishment volunteered for military duty with the Kabul forces, and have done good service in base hospitals and on the several lines of com- munications. 10. His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor is glad to observe that the class of practising midwives or dhaies continues successful, and that four women, who have regularly attended the course of lectures for three years, have this year passed with credit the final examination in midwifery. 11. One of the most important events in the history of the School during the year under review was the foundation by His Highness the Nawab of Bahawalpur, at a cost of Rs. 10,000, of a set of scholarships called the Grey Scholarships, in honor of Major Leopold John Herbert Grey, C. S. I., late Political Agent of Bahawalpur. 12. The loss that the Medical School sustained in the death of Dr. Neil was alluded to in the orders passed on the Report of the preceding year. The vacancy in the staff of Professors thus created has been filled by Dr. Lawrie, who entered upon his duties as Professor of Anatomy and Surgery at the com- mencement of the winter session. 13. The Lieutenant-Governor desires to acknowledge the good service done during the past year by the Principal and the several Professors attached to the School.

ANNUAL REPORT ON THE LAHORE MEDICAL SCHOOL For the Year 1870-71. No. 138, dated 6th May 1871 From( 2 ) I am desirous also of mentioning that the benefits which the school confers on the pro- vince are thoroughly appreciated by the people, and that this is shown by the number of candidates who now come forward for the entrance examinations. At the examination in 1870 for the Hindustani Class there were 99 candidates for 25 vacancies in the Military Division, and 10 candidates in the Local Division. The candidates were carefully examined in reading and explaining the meaning of terms in the Urdu language; also in writing the same from dictation, and in working out sums in simple arithmetic. Also those who possessed a knowledge of the English, Pushtu or Punjabee language were separately examined in reading and speaking each of these. The best students were selected, and were further examined as to their physical capacity. The Principal and Sub-Assistant Surgeons Raheem Khan, Mahomed Hoossain Khan, and Brij Lall Ghose, acted as examiners. It is evident that much of the success of the school must depend on the carefulness of this selection, which has the advantage of being made from so large a number in open com- petition from all parts of the country, and which must have proved a great stimulus to education in the province. At the subsequent examination in 1871, there were no less than 190 candidates for 20 vacancies; but this will be referred to in the report of next year. It must be remembered that all the above candidates paid their own travelling expenses from their homes to the school, and the cost of their maintenance while being examined, and that those who were unsuccessful had to defray their expenses on their return. At the examination for the English Class, 26 students competed for nine scholarships. The examination was conducted in the same way, but the English language was employed instead of the Hindustani. In future, it is intended that undergraduates of the Calcutta University or Lahore University College should be admitted to study in the school without further examination; but this innovation has not yet been put into practice, though one undergraduate of the Calcutta University was placed first at the examination held for the English Class in last October. * Not printed.
