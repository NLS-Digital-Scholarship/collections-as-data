OFFICE OF SURGEON-GENERAL WITH THE GOVT. OF MADRAS, MADRAS, 29th March 1893. No. 312. From SURGEON-MAJOR-GENERAL W. F. DEFABECK, M.D., Surgeon-General with the Government of Madras, Madras, To THE CHIEF SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT. SIR, I HAVE the honour to forward, for the information of the Right Honorable the Governor in Council, the annual report on the Lunatic Asylums in the Madras Presidency for the year 1892. 2.

The ques- tion of firewood also arises in this connection, since Government has recently directed the quantity of firewood to be cut down considerably. These enclosed sheds will prevent petty larceny by the menial servants of the establishments, and afford valuable shelter in rainy weather. I shall address Government on this matter on receipt of a further report from the Superintendent. 5. The surface drainage of the grounds has been unsatisfactory for some years past, the existing drains not being quite efficient and part of the asylum is not drained at all. A scheme has now been submitted, and all parties agree as to the mode of drainage though there is a difference of opinion as to its final disposal. The Consulting Architect suggests that the existing drains will be sufficient, when improved, to drain most of the asylum grounds; that the North side and the female enclosure should be drained separately, the drainage making its way through the wall by separate openings. It is conceded that the surface drainage is partly contaminated by the washings (containing urine) of the night blocks, and the Pre- sident of the Municipality objected to this being allowed to make its way out of the grounds at all, The subject, however, is now receiving careful attention and will be separately submitted to Government. 6. The question of placing the water-supply on a more satisfactory footing is under consideration and will be finally disposed of when the masonry filter sanctioned by Government to be placed where the Red Hills water enters the ground, has been completed. 7. ACCOMMODATION.ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 5 It will be seen that in Madras there was an appreciable decrease in the death- rate, while in Waltair and Calicut there was a large increase. In the case of Calicut the increased death-rate is explained by the Superintendent as being chiefly due to an outbreak of cholera which caused 9 deaths, 3, however, died from other bowel-complaints. At Waltair the death-rate (20.98) represents, however, only 9 deaths, of which 2 died of bowel-complaints. The remaining deaths in both the asylums were of the usual type common among insanes. 9. The daily average sick increased in all the asylums. In Madras it was 38.73 against 16.41. This increase was due to the weakly condition of the insanes on admission and to the efforts made to stay the sickness and mortality by largely increasing the number of patients in hospital and in the convalescent gang. The truth of this explanation will be seen from the fact that, in 1891, there were 37 admissions for debility and 2 for anæmia, while, in 1892, the figures were 76 and 20 respectively, evidently showing the Superintendent's anxiety to exercise great supervision over the obviously weakly cases. On the other hand, the admissions for bowel-complaints showed a large decrease, the figures being for 1891 dysentery 60 and diarrh6 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. It will be seen from this that the mortality among the female insanes has approximated to that among males in the Madras Asylum. 13. RELIGION AND SEX.ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 7 As remarked in previous years, epileptic insanity and dementia are the most intractable of all mental derangements. Of the 5 cases that continued under treat- ment from last year for " other forms of insanity," 1 recovered, 2 improved and 1 was discharged without improvement, so that there still remained on the last day of 1892 one case under this head, viz., senile insanity; of the 6 cases that were not diagnosed last year, one died and the others were discharged, as no signs of insanity could be observed in them. 17.

27TH MAY 1893, Nos. 1080, 1081, JUDICIAL. GOVERNMENT OF MADRAS. JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT. READ2 27TH MAY 1893, Nos. 1080, 1081, JUDICIAL The most noticeable points about this statement are the continuous decline in the daily average strength and the extraordinarily high death-rate of the last three years ; the former is, no doubt, the result of the latter. As regards the Madras Asylum, the death-rate in 1892 (17.34 per cent.) was considerably below that in 1891 and slightly below the figure in 1890, and this decrease combined with the very large increase in the daily average number of sick suggests more careful medical supervision of the patients ; but the mortality was still regrettably high. Calicut and Waltair, on the other hand, show a very large advance as compared with 1891 in the rate of mor- tality.

It is observed that the outlay on contingencies at the Madras Asylum was Rs. 6,081, against Rs. 2,031 in 1891 and Rs. 2,969 in 1890 ; the increase in 1892 is stated to have been mainly due to the payment of taxes for two years during the year. The Government desires to have details of the contingent expenditure in 1892 ; the explanation afforded seems altogether insufficient. The increase in the expenditure on contingencies in the other Asylums appears to have been principally the result of the transfer of all criminal lunatics to Madras during the year. 7.

OFFICE OF SURGEON-GENERAL WITH THE GOVT. OF MADRAS, MADRAS, 21st March 1894. No. 261. From SURGEON-MAJOR-GENERAL W. F. DEFABECK, M.D., Surgeon-General with the Government of Madras, Madras, To THE HON'BLE THE CHIEF SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT. SIR, I HAVE the honor to submit to the Right Honorable the Governor in Council the annual report for 1893 on the Lunatic Asylums in this Presidency. The statements in the appendix have been revised during the year and particulars of the different kinds of lunatics in confinement given in the body of the report in accordance with the directions in the foot-note in Statement II of the revised form communicated with G.O., No. 1601 of 11th August 1893. 2. ACCOMMODATION.4 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 763 against 837 in 1892. The details regarding admissions, discharges, &c., are noted in the following abstract with corresponding figures for the previous year:ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 5 Previous occupation was ascertained in 210 cases out of a total admission of 211. The improvement made in this direction is very satisfactory. Of the known cases 39 were coolies and 21 mendicants or beggars; 18 insanes had no special calling or profession. 159 of the admissions or 75.35 per cent. were between the ages of 20 and 40, when the struggle for existence is comparatively great and the brain most active ; the physical and moral causes that tend to produce insanity are known to be gene- rally met with at this age. Under 20 and above 60 years, the two extreme limits of age given in the table, the admissions have always been small. The causes have been fully explained in previous years, and need no recapitulation here. 6. TYPES OF INSANITY.6 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. The accompanying abstract contrasts the cost per head of an insane during 1893 with those for 1892 under the several heads of charges :ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 7 First-half of 1892-93.

In the abstract given above the charges under hospital necessaries and mis- cellanies have been omitted for want of a separate column, and, if Government see no objection, such charges will, in future, be included under medicines with the necessary foot-note. The average monthly cost of dieting a European or Eurasian paying patients in Madras was Rs. 13-6-9 against Rs. 10-7-11, the cost of feeding a pauper patient and that of a native paying patient was Rs. 5-2-4 against Rs. 6-3-5, the cost of a non-paying patient. In Waltair the cost was Rs. 3-5-6 for a paying patient and Rs. 2-8-4 for a pauper patient. In Calicut the charges were respec- tively Rs. 4-14-4 and Rs. 15-5-6 for a pauper and a paying patient. The exhor- bitant cost in dieting a paying patient in this asylum was apparently due to a very small average strength of this class of patients. The value of garden produce was in Madras Rs. 215-12-9, in Waltair Rs. 333-15-0 and in Calicut Rs. 215-15-4. 11. The sanctioned establishment of the three asylums are given in State- ment X appended to the report, the number and cost continue very much the same as in previous years with slight changes here and there. The proportion of attendants and toties sanctioned by Government was main- tained as far as practicable. 12. Statement XI shows the working of the factories. In Madras out of a mean population of 439, 273 inmates were employed on manufacture. In Calicut and Waltair the number was respectively 24.39 and 22. The profits during the year were in Madras Rs. 2,230-10-4, in Vizagapatam and Calicut the amounts were respectively Rs. 361-5-4 and Rs. 544-9-10. In the Madras Asylum, in addition to the weaving of cotton goods, the manu- facture of cumblies was started up during the year under report. 13. The inventory of the valuable stock of the three asylums has been duly checked and found correct. 14. GENERAL REMARKS.APPENDIX. 3

READ2 18TH MAY 1894, Nos. 1190, 1191, JUDICIAL. amounted to 108.08 against 53.78 in 1892 and 26.75 in 1891. The Surgeon-General declares that the increase in 1893 is not ascribable to a general low state of health, but to the exercise of closer medical supervision. This explanation is not applicable to the Calicut Asylum, where, as previously remarked, the sick-rate was comparatively low, and it is probable that, elsewhere, the increase is to some extent only nominal, being the result of the more careful registration of members of the weakly gangs. It appears from the Surgeon-General's letter, read in G.O., dated 4th July 1891, No. 1320, Judicial, to have been the custom until recently to exclude members of the weakly gangs from the hospital returns, but it is presumed that all such persons now appear in column 10 of Statement No. 1. The vital statistics of asylums correspond, in the main, very closely with those of jails and the fall in the death-rate during 1893 in the case of both classes of institutions is, no doubt, largely attributable to the greater general healthiness of that year ; it is probable that the improvement in the death-rates of the Madras and Vizagapatam Asylums is also due, to some extent, to more careful supervision on the part of the Superintendents. 3. The figures relating to the registration of the previous occupations of the patients admitted during 1893 are satisfactory. The statistics in Statement VII show that the cause of insanity was undetected in 33.4 per cent. of the total number of cases treated in 1893 ; this figure exhibits a marked improvement upon previous years, but the number of cases assigned to an unknown cause is still large. 4. The next and least satisfactory portion of the report relates to finance. Some statistics of the average cost under certain heads of each patient during the last five years are annexed :18TH MAY 1894, Nos. 1190, 1191, JUDICIAL. 3 these causes ; when this has been received it will be possible to test the accuracy of the Surgeon-General's arguments ; at the present juncture a cursory examination of the various causes mentioned is all that is possible. The increase due to the first cause must, at all events, have been trifling. As to the second cause, it is curious to find the Inspector-General of Jails attributing a decrease in the cost of dieting to the reduced prices of the staple items during 1893, while the Surgeon-General argues that the prices rose in the year under review ; as a fact the price of rice (the staple article of food in asylums) was, on the whole, lower in Madras and on the West Coast during 1893 than during the previous year. As to the enhancement of expenditure on fire- wood, it is observed that in G.O., dated 24th February 1893, No. 410, Judicial, the reduction of the allowance per patient from 10½ to 81b. a week was ordered, and in G.O., dated 24th December 1892, No. 894, Public, the Government ordered the intro- duction of a system of supply which, if properly worked, ought to have resulted in a considerable saving on this item. The fourth cause assigned by the Surgeon-General is not understood ; the system of departmental supply having replaced the contract system, the reference to enhanced contract rates needs explanation. The question of wastage at Calicut is under consideration separately. The fifth cause may be a valid one and, assuming that Superintendents exercise a reasonable discretion in ordering extra diets, the Government would raise no objection to an increase of expenditure resulting therefrom. The main point to be noticed is that this enhancement of cost has taken place in spite of the substitution of a cheaper scale of diet under G.O., dated 26th June 1893, No. 1292, Judicial. During the last four years the Government has persistently dwelt upon the necessity for curtailing expenditure in the Madras Asylum but without result. That economy is possible has been proved by a comparison of the dieting charges in other provinces and at Waltair with those in the Madras Asylum and the only conclusion to be drawn is that no real effort has been made to give effect to the orders of Government, The exorbitant cost of dieting a paying patient at Calicut should be further investigated. With regard to the proposal to show hospital necessaries and miscellaneous items under the head " Medicines," the Surgeon-General should report the nature of the items falling under these two denominations. 5. The last subject calling for notice is manufactures. The statistics for 1893 and the two preceding years are given below:4 18TH MAY 1894, Nos. 1190, 1191, JUDICIAL. observed that the institution at Waltair is spoken of, indifferently, as " the Waltair Asylum " and " the Vizagapatam Asylum." This may lead to misunderstanding on the part of persons who are not acquainted with this Presidency and one or other name (preferably the latter) should be adopted and adhered to. (True Extract.) J.

SIBTHORPE, F.R.C.P.I., Surgeon-General with the Government of Madras, Madras, To THE HON'BLE THE CHIEF SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit to the Right Honourable the Governor in Council the annual report for 1894 on the Lunatic Asylums in the Presidency. In Decem- ber last I issued orders to the three Superintendents to submit their administration reports in the same form under the following heads which include all questions of administration concerning the asylums. 2. ACCOMMODATION.4 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 4. SANITATIONANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 5 drinking6 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. their other clothes may be kept dry for the night. I do not consider this necessary; if any of the patients' clothes are wet before they are turned in at night they should be replaced by dry ones. In Calicut those who were weakly were provided with cumbly jackets during the monsoon. In the Madras Asylum, the clothing is usually sufficientANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 7 (d) Escapes.8 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. criminal cottage is used for the purpose when required. Similarly in Calicut there is no separate hospital accommodation for females and they are located and treated in one of the cells in the female enclosure which accommodates 8; there is hospital accommodation for 15 males. In the Madras Asylum there is no real hospital accommodation for males specially adapted for the proper treatment of the sick. In the old criminal enclosure there are two ordinary barrack blocks and eight single cells capable of holding a total of 32 patients. The two single blocks at present accommodate 12 sick each, with a superficial area of only 60 square feet per patient, which the Superintendent considers too low for the sick. He says " considering the number of insane patients who require treatment for mental and physical ailments in hospital, the accommodation is utterly inadequate for men. The hospital blocks themselves are but ill-adapted for their purpose being without separate accommo- dation for isolating superior patients or others requiring individually special treat- ment ; there are no baths, no hot water laid on or means of obtaining it except by boiling it in a pot at the enclosure in the open, no ward at all for Europeans, and the whole arrangements are a make-shift." The accommodation for females has been increased during the year by the inclusion of the old male hospital which now affords space for 14 in-patients, where formerly it was for five. The space has been sufficient up to the present time, but the arrangements are faulty as on the male side. Proposals are under consideration for the accommodation of 80 males and 20 females. Two separate isolation blocks of three single rooms each are used for contagious diseases among the males, and two isolation blocks of three rooms each for the females. Although these blocks were built evidently with an eye to the security of the lunatic patients the accommodation does not appear to be suitable for an epidemic, 8. SICKNESS AND ITS CAUSESANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 9 the next largest entries are under anæmia and ulcer, conditions which indicate when in large numbers, a general feebleness of health complicating the above con- ditions and liberal treatment in the direction of food, stimulants and tonic treatment generally. Insane patients are delicate feeders, their mental state makes them exceedingly capricious, and if capricious, it is waste of time to attempt to reason with insanes. They should either be given food which they like or they must be kept on a fixed diet, but in the latter case we must be prepared to constantly see them fed with great difficulty and slipping little by little into an anaemic state, losing weight and at last when deteriorated in health to put them on a diet, it would have been better to have kept them on always." " Criminal insanes have often come in from jails where they have been for some time fed on raggi under observation ; it is the fresh admissions whose mental state it is difficult to gauge further than that they suffer from a certain type of mental disease, but as to how far their bodily health is affected by their mind, and has been so, it is impossible to say without observation for some time. These especially are the people to put on rice diet, not on raggi though it may not at first appear to affect them." I have informed the Superintendent that such insanes as were accustomed to the use of raggi or cholum should be put on them on admission, that rice might be given to such patients as require it in the opinion of the Superintendent and that to put all on a rice diet would be a useless waste of public money. The standing orders regarding asylums very properly leave the dieting of the patients in the hands of the medical officer and give him ample power. If he acts on them thoroughly and at the same time carries out the orders regarding the inspec- tion of all insanes who have lost weight after each fortnightly weighment, there ought to be no fear of any patient suffering from underfeeding. 9.

One of the greatest advantages of the new rules is that it gives the Medical officer the power of dieting a patient on ' extras ' alone so that there need not be any waste as would be the case when the diet is restricted to the old rigid scales. 13.

Considering that the asylum population and the average strength have increased from 763 and 564.43 in 1893 to 806 and 621.27, respectively, in 1894, the decrease is very satisfactory and bears evidence of the economical working of the asylums. The following statement contrasts the several items of expenditure during the year with those of 1893. It has been adopted for the purpose of showing clearly to the different Superintendents the directions in which economy is pos- sible and will give from year to year an admirable idea of how the finances of the institution have been looked into by the Superintendents :14 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 1894.

In the matter of clothing and bedding the amount debited for the year compares favourably with 1893. This is explained by the Superintendent as being due to the fact that no indents were submitted for clothing for the last eight months of the year as none was required. The charges under contingencies and medicines were also less. The new conservancy arrangements, by which the municipality removed the night-soil of the asylum free of cost, came into force on the 1st September 1894 and effected a saving of Rs. 122, so that the cost per head of the average strength under all heads of charges was only Rs. 155-6-0 against Rs. 184-1-6 in the preceding year. In the Vizagapatam Asylum the cost per head of an insane calculated on the average strength was Rs. 86-9-11 against Rs. 105-10-10 in 1893, or Rs. 19-0-11 less than in last year. This decrease in the aggregate on an examination of the statement above is found to be due to the favourable diminution under the several heads noted below:ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 15 In the Calicut Asylum there has been no corresponding decrease as in the other two asylums, but the figures very nearly approximated those of last year; the difference in the cost per head under all the items put together being only a few annas and pies. The total cost of establishment in 1894 was Rs. 4,059-7-8 against Rs. 3,867-4-9 in the preceding year, but the cost per head for the year under report was comparatively less owing to the mean population in 1894 being greater than in 1893. The diet cost shows a very small increase over last year being Rs. 61-11-2 against Rs. 60-15-0 in last year. This excess during the year was due to the more extensive issue of extras to the sick and weakly insanes and requires the careful investigation of the Superintendent. There was also an increase of rates in the tender for 1894, for some of the principal ingredients of food which are given below :16 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. No extra diet has been given to the paying patients during the past year so that the cost of dieting has been the same as for an ordinary patient. In Calicut there were no paying patients during the year and the average number of pauper patients was 98.07. The average monthly cost of diet of a pauper patient was Rs. 5-2-3.

I think his work should be lightened considerably in the steward's department, leaving him real leisure, where he now has not any, to follow up his professional work. If his responsibility is not lightened his work cannot be delegated with safety; and if much of his work can be delegated and as I firmly maintain ought to be, his responsibility should be altogether removed. He should not be called upon to buy dholl and rice, to examine vouchers for the supply of blankets, and to trace out where a pair of slippers has gone, but if his responsibility is not removed over details such as these; his duty will be to constantly scrutinize innumerable petty details, find out and correct petty errors, until what I may call the distinctive characteristics of his mind from the medical side, are put aside more or less com- pletely to take up those of a clerk, store-keeper and jail warder. This will always make the work of superintendence in the Madras Asylum so irksome and with its present size so unmanageable, that unless the whole system be altered, I cannot believe that any Medical Officer can either be happy or properly useful, considering his mental training and qualifications, while so over-harrassed with such innumer- able petty vexations."

There is not too much to do, if his time could be, which it cannot be, exclusively devoted to the details of cooking itself alone, but it is the system which pervades the asylum of using men on details of duty which overlap one another, and are all taken together impossible of proper fulfilment, that has done so much harm: all the stress arises from this. If Mr. McKenzie were only all day at the kitchen, he could adequately supervise the cooking arrangements, but to give him clerk's work as well, means indifferent cooking, owing to indifferent supervision by him, and errors in the clerical details of his accounts which again throw back more work on steward and Superintendent to find out and set right."

Now, our number of toties is fixed at 1 to 20 general patients and so necessary are they with the filthy nature of many lunatics, that were we to have a sudden strike of toties, we should be as we are now situated utterly unable to really remove the filth; there is no efficient mechanical means of doing so wholesale, and our blocks are so situated that most are distinct units, requiring individual cleaning; this is a most crying evil, as it puts us at the mercy of these men, and one of our greatest needs is to be able to dispense with toties to a great extent and have a complete system of flushing, and drainage drawn up for the whole Asylum by which manual labour could be minimized, the supervision of toties done away with to the greatest extent instead of having as now, one of the greatest difficulties and responsibilities to see that toties do their work adequately.''

I have much pleasure in endorsing the opinion of Surgeon-Major Elcum regarding the good work done by Military Assistant Surgeon Judge and Civil Apothecary Cooper during the year and more especially during the trying time while the epidemic of cholera lasted between December 1894 and February 1895.

APPENDIX TO ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 23 APPENDIX I. REPORT ON THE OUTBREAK OF CHOLERA IN 1894-95. BY SURGEON-MAJOR D. ELCUM, SUPERINTENDENT OF THE LUNATIC ASYLUM. THE outbreak commenced on the 29th December 1894, though one doubtful case occurred on the 24th. A Mr. Downey, one of the European attendants, who had been feeling slightly indis- posed from the 22nd, had several evacuations on the 23rd and by the 24th was so ill that he was transferred to the General Hospital. This case was, however, not looked upon as one of cholera, but rather as an attack of diarrh24 APPENDIX TO ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. (g) Drainage.PLAN OF CRIMINAL ENCLOSURE.

APPENDIX TO ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 25 REMARKS BY THE SURGEON-GENERAL WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF MADRAS. 1. The Superintendent of the Lunatic Asylum, Madras, reported to me on the 30th Pecember 1894, that five insanes had been attacked on the previous day with cholera and died within a few hours of their admission, also that other patients, who had been admitted during the night of the 29th, were in a more or less precarious state. All the men who had been attacked were from the criminal enclosure though from different blocks. 2. I visited the asylum on the 31st December and gave orders that the cases should be treated in the isolation wards, and suggested certain precautions which he carried out. 3. This report clearly shows that Mr. Downey, the European attendant, passed his evacuations on the 22nd December in the general latrine of the criminal enclosure and that no precautions were taken about these as cholera was not suspected, also that the evacuations passed by him on the night of the 23rd and the morning of the 24th December were collected in a chatty and put with other filth into the buckets at the general latrine (Block No. 112, Government plan) outside the criminal enclosure, that no dry earth or disinfectant of any kind was used when removing these. It appears that his servant was in the habit of daily going to the Smithfield market and had been to his own house near Chintadripet on the 19th December. As far as can be ascertained neither he nor his master was in immediate contact with persons suffering from cholera, although outbreaks of this disease existed in Madras following on the dispersion of the crowds from the great festival at Trinnomalle. Konkichettivadu, who was taken ill on the 27th December, was sent to hospital from Block 7, Section IV (Government plan). The first case attacked in the female enclosure was Kulliamal, who was grinding grain on the 27th December and came in contact with men who brought the grain bags from the criminal to the female enclosure. 4. A copy of the site plan is attached to the report to show the buildings from which the cases were admitted in the order of their admissions :26 APPENDIX TO ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. (5) That the cholera exoreta should not be buried in the compound even after disin- fection; (6) That buckets used for emptying out drain water should be of a different pattern from those used for the ward, and that care should be taken that buckets used for wards are not employed in any manner, in connection with the washing of eating and drinking vessels; (7) That special vessels should be used for giving water to patients at night, and that each ward should have its own flushing pail and if this is too expensive, that each pail be washed with perchloride of mercury lotion before passing from ward to ward, and that the drains should be cleansed daily with perchloride of mercury lotion; (8) That, as far as possible, all clothing and blankets in use should be soaked in per- chloride of mercury lotion and then exposed to the direct rays of the sun ; (9) That blankets used by cholera patients should be subjected to two hours' boiling in perchloride of mercury lotion ; (10) That patients should be numbered off to their wards and transfers be discountenanced as far as possible, and that each transfer when made be registered with a view to maintaining the history of each patient; (11) That segregation of the excreta of patients recovered from cholera should be observed for at least ten days after such apparent recovery ; and (12) That pay or batta be sanctioned that will ensure the regular attendance of toties during the epidemic. 7. His suggestions (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5), had already been carried out under my instructions. I ordered that (8), (9) and (11) should at once be carried out and that (6), (7) and (10) be acted upon if possible, and that I would pass or recommend special batta to any men who were reported to have done good work. 8. In reply, the Superintendent proposed that the cistern be used for the daily bath alone and that the well water be used for gardening and bathing only, under the supervision of a European attendant. This was approved. The disinfection of the well with chlorinated lime and sulphite of sodium was thought to be too late. It is a great pity that this was not carried out in time. The continuation of the ordinary garden cultivation and the use of the vegetables were also allowed, as the epidemic had subsided. 9. All clothing, except 81 blankets used during the epidemic, was destroyed. I have sanc- tioned the proposal of the Superintendent to keep these blankets separate in the isolation blocks ready for future use in epidemics. 10. This outbreak of cholera is the most severe that has occurred in the asylum for many years. There were altogether 64 cases and 44 deaths or a mortality of 68.75 per cent. I concur with the Acting Sanitary Commissioner that it is a great pity that the earlier cases were not diagnosed as cholera and prompt steps taken for their isolation and the disinfection and destruc- tion of their evacuations The facts that Mr. Downey, the European attendant, passed several of his evacuations on the 22nd in the general latrine of the criminal enclosure, that the first native attacked was from Block 7 in the criminal enclosure, and that the third case occurred in the female enclosure and was a woman who had been in contact with the men from the criminal enclosure seems to me to show a connection between these cases. If these facts are taken in connection with the fact that Professor Hankin discovered a microbe indistinguishable from that of cholera in the slime of the water sent to him from the criminal enclosure about thirty days after the first case. I consider the sequence is as clear as one can expect to get it in most epidemics. 11. Professor Hankin's investigations are most important as illustrating the advantages of such bacteriological investigations being carried out early in such doubtful cases. Surgeon- Major Elcum had some reason for doubting these early cases being cholera at all and appears to have had no suspicion about Mr, Downey who was sent to the General Hospital where he was admitted for and treated as suffering from ptomaine-poisoning of a doubtful character. The subsequent history of the epidemic seems to me to clearly prove that Mr. Downey doubtless was suffering from actual cholera which a bacteriological examination would have at once put out of doubt. 12. The history of this epidemic has strongly shown the absolute necessity of carrying out an efficient system of drainage. The filthy habits of a large number of these insanes render the necessity of good drainage which will prevent the soakage of human evacuations into the soil even more necessary in a Lunatic asylum than in any other building. 13. It has also brought prominently to notice the fact of our great dependence on the services of the toties and the absolute necessity of our being able to deal with them. As it is not possible to punish them, I have laid certain propositions before Government with the view of encouraging good work by a system of rewards. Notwithstanding the fact that during the past ten years (see appendix B to the report) cholera has appeared in five different years, no general rules regarding quarantine and the isolation of such cases have been drawn up. Such rules are now under preparation and will be inserted in the new edition of the Asylum Code.

SIBTHORPE, Surgeon-General with the Government of Madras, to the Chief Secretary to Government, dated Ootacamund, 13th May 1895, No. 140-T. I have the honour to forward herewith two copies of the Annual reports for 1894 on the Lunatic Asylums in this Presidency. 2. I regret the delay in its submission which has been explained in my letter, No. 72-T. of the 25th ultimo. Orderdated 18th June 1895, No. 1303, Judicial. The report on the administration of Lunatic Asylums for 1894 was not received until the 14th of Maynearly a month after the due dateand it has consequently been impossible to review it within the date prescribed by the Government of India. 2. Statistics showing the total asylum population are given below: Year. Number admitted. Daily average strength. Percentage of deaths to daily average strength. 1890 1891 1892 1893 1894 197 213 245 211 210 620 G14 571 564 621 18-38 18-57 18-22 11-69 10-30 The accommodation appears to have been ample and the Surgeon-General's remark that the criminal enclosure of the Madras Asylum was deficient in this respect is not understood. In the separate representation which he made on the subject, viz., his letter No. 3-T., dated 9th April 1895, it was stated that the maximum number for whom accommodation was ever required was only 148, while there was room available for 150, besides buildings temporarily allotted to other uses than the accommodation of criminal insanes. It is satisfactory to observe that the death-rate has continued to fall. The total number of deaths was 64, of which two took place at Vizagapatam, both from unavoidable causes, six at Calicut and 50 at Madras. Death resulted in thirteen cases from debility and anoemia, in nine cases from catarrhal inflammation of the intestines, while dysentery was the cause of mortality in eight cases, cholera in eight more, and lung affections in nine. The deaths from cholera all occurred in the Madras Asylum, in which a serious outbreak commenced in the last few days of the year under report and continued until the 9th of Eebruary 1895. The total number of attacks during this period was 64, 44 of which were fatal. Appendix I to the report deals fully with the origin, progress and treatment of the epidemic which must have caused the Surgeon-General and the Superintendent much labour and anxiety. The Surgeon-General speaks of this epidemic as showing the absolute necessity of carrying out an efficient system of drainage and of having the scavenging service under better control. The latter defect will, it is hoped, be sufficiently remedied by the introduction of good service pay to the toties which has been
18th June 1895, Nos. 1303, 1304, Judicial. sanctioned in G.O., dated 26th April 1895, No. 874. The delay in introducing an adequate drainage system is partly due to the fact that the recommendations of the committee appointed in G.O., dated 22nd February 1894, No. 454, were unaccompanied by detailed reasons for the various suggestions made or information sufficient to enable Government to come to a decision on the matter. It was consequently found necessary to return the report to the committee for amplification. The daily average sick rate amounted to 104'89 against 108*08 in 1893. As the daily average strength was considerably higher in 1894, these figures indicate a general improvement in health. No reliable comparison can be made with the figures relating to earlier years, as there is reason to suppose that it is only recently that complete hospital returns have been maintained. There is a remarkable coincidence between the figures showing the number of insanes remaining at the end of the year in the Madras Asylum and the daily average strength {vide columns 8 and 9 of Statement I). The same remark applies to the corresponding figures relating to criminal lunatics (vide columns 8 and 9 of Statement II). The occurrence of integers in columns 9 and 10 of Statement I and in column 9 of Statement II is also curious. 3. Statement No. IY contains what purport to be virtually complete figures relating to the registration of the previous occupations of the patients admitted during the year. Statement No. YII shows that the cause of insanity was believed to be detected in 72 per cent, of the total number of cases under treatment during the year. This percentage is considerably higher than in previous years and the improvement is due to the fact that, while 222 insaues were admitted or re-admitted during the year, the cause of insanity was thought to be undetected in only sixteen instances. 4. The next portion of the report to be discussed, is that which deals with finance. Statistics comparing the average cost per patient under the main heads of expenditure, during the past five years are shown below : Diet. Clothing and Bedding. Medicines. Year.

There has thus been a satisfactory improvement iu the Madras Asylum, while even more economy than usual has been displayed in the administration of the Vizagapatani Asylum,a circumstance which reflects much credit upon the (Superintendent and the hospital assistant who has been in direct charge. The general decrease in expenditure is no doubt partly due to the lower rates of grain prices, but it is to be hoped that improved administration is the main cause. The diet scale sanctioned in G.O., dated 26th June 1893, No. 1292, was in use in all the asylums and appears to
18th June 1895, Nos. 1308, 1304, Judicial. have been successful in both Vizagapatam and Calicut but the reverse in Madras, where, however, the Surgeon-General seems to attribute the failure to preventible causes, such as the indifferent selection, cleaning and cooking of the grain used. Comparison with the results in Vizagapatam and Calicut tends to a similar conclusion and it is to be hoped that greater care in the preparation of the diets at Madras will produce more favourable results. As regards the question of the sufficiency of the diet scale, it is observed that the Superintendent of the Madras Asylum and the Sui geon-General write of apprehensions lest patients should suffer from under-feeding. The Surgeon-General will no doubt report further regarding this, if necessary. No explanation is offered of the very great difference in the cost per head of medicines in the asylums at Madras and Vizagapatam as compared with the figures for 1893 ; this should now be furnished. The total cost under all heads of maintaining the three Lunatic Asylums during 1894 as compared with 1893 is shown below : I . Madras. Vi zagapatam. Calicut. Total. 1893 1894 R8. 80,818 73,649 : RS. 4,342 4,262 i RS. 10,610 12,307 us. ';&gt;&quot;&gt;,770 90,218 The decrease in cost may be regarded as satisfactory, seeing that the daily average strength in 1894 was 57 higher than in 1893, but the Government is convinced that there is room for a further reduction in expenditure in the Madras and Calicut Asylums. That the Madras Asylum should compare unfavourably with the other two is especially remarkable, seeing that it is the only one provided with a whole-time Superintendent, but an explanation may in part be found in the fact that it contains European and Eurasian patients, who are not received in the other two asylums. 5. The following table compares the statistics relating to manufactures during the last three years : Asylum. Percentage of average number employed to daily average strength. Profits on manufactures. Amount of profits per head of average number employed. 1892. 1893. 1894. 1892. 1893. 1891. 1892. 1893. 1894. Madras ..

V. 8 :; 0 7 o 7 16 7 0 27 0 1 22 11 0 27 9 7 Statement No. XI is incorrect in that it adopts oue method of valuation in respect of the stock on hand at the beginning of the year and another in respect of that on hand at the end of the&quot;year. The profits cannot be regarded as satisfactory in the Madras Asylum and it is difficult to understand why so much better results are achieved in the two other asylums; the Surgeon-General should devote special attention to the point. The proportion of insanes employed at the Calicut Asylum appears to be unduly Jow. 6. Separate orders will be passed on the various proposals for improving asylum buildings or revising establishment which are referred to in the Surgeon-General's report. With reference to the remarks contained in paragraph 4 (h) of the report and made by Surgeon-Major Elcum regarding the difficulty of amusing the patients, Hie Surgeon-General will be requested to submit such proposals as he thinks suitable. 7. On the whole, the administration of the Lunatic Asylum at Vizagapatam appears to have been highly satisfactory, increased economy having been effected under almost every head, while the general health was good. At Madras there was a general improvement in the administration, but, as has already been remarked, the ( tovernment expects a further advance in this direction. In Calicut there was but little change
' 18th June 1895, Nos. 1303, 1304, Judicial. as compared with the previous year and the remarks most called for is that increased economy appears to be required. In last year's review the Surgeon-General's attention was especially drawn to the necessity of introducing economies, stimulating manufactures and reducing the mortality in the two asylums last mentioned. The mortality has been reduced in Calicut and economies have to some extent been effected in Madras, but much yet remains to be done before the administration of these two institutions can be regarded as satisfactory.

ANNUAL EEPORT ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN THE MADRAS PRESIDENCY FOR THE TEAE 1895. MADRAS : FEINTED BY THE SUPERINTENDENT, GOVERNMENT PRESS, 1896.
From Office of Scrgeon-General with the Government of Madras, Madras, lbth April 1896. No. T/5A. Surgeon-Major-General C. SIBTHORPE, f.b.c.p.i., Surgeon-General with the Government of Madras, The Hon'ble The CHIEF SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Judicial Department. To Sir, I have the honour to submit to His Excellency the Governor in Council the annual report on the working of the Lunatic Asylums in the Presidency for the year 1895. 2. General Administration*In G.O., No. 1303, Judicial, dated 18th June 1895, reviewing the report on Lunatic Asylums for the year 1894, Government expressed a hope that the introduction of good service pay for the toties of the Madras Asylum would render their services more useful and bring them under better control. The experience of nearly a year shows that, after its introduction, their work has been more satisfactory, but the Superintendent considers that room for complaint still exists amongst them, as they lose their good-conduct pay of one rupee if by any reason they absent themselves one day without leave no matter how hard they work on other days. The proposal to build huts for toties on the same plan as those of the native attendants has been approved by Government in G.O., No. 109, Judicial, dated 17th January 1896 which will be an additional encouragement for this class of servants. In the same order Government asked me to report regarding proposals for the amusements of insanes. I have, in consultation with the various [Superintendents, submitted proposals in my letter No. 169 of 4th March 1896. In circulating the above order to the various Superintendents, I issued the following instructions: (1) The necessity of seeing that the statistics and notes for their annual report are kept up to date from month to month so that the annual one may be submitted in time. (2) Directed the Superintendent of the Madras Asylum to devote special care to the manufactures in the asylum, which, it is gratifying to note, has brought about much better results as will be seen from paragraph 18 infra. (3) Their attention was called to the importance of noting in their reports the number of cases which required forcible feeding with the different methods adopted for the purpose, the result of which is also shown in paragraph 10 infra. (4) They were also required to furnish a uniform tabular statement of weighment results in order that it might bo seen clearly whether the diets in the asylums are agreeing with the patients or not. A statement prepared according to my instructions is appended to paragraph 5 (e) infra. In my letters, No. T 4/35, dated &quot;29th November 1894, No. 661, dated 10th December 1894, and No. 111-A, dated 7th February 1895, I submitted proposals to Government for the revision of the establishment of the Madras Lunatic Asylum, and in G.O., No. 1511, Judicial, dated 17th July 1895, Government has disposed of this question in the following manner: (1) Medical Subordinates.In sanctioning the proposal regarding the substitution of a Second-class Hospital Assistant on Rs. 50 per mensem for the third Apothecary on Rs. 105, Government authorised me to employ only medical subordinates of such grades in the two different classes, i.e., Apothecaries or
4 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. Hospital Assistants, as may be found most convenient, subject always to the sanctioned number of each class not being exceeded vide G.O., No. 2030, Judicial, dated 12th October 1895. (2) Nursing Establishment.The proposal in this connection was modified in the above order thus : (a) That the matron on Rs. 60 a month should be given a ration allowance Rs. 15 a month. (6) Sanctioned the entertainment of three nurses temporarily on Rs. 40, 80 and 20 a month with a ration allowance of Rs. 15 a month each pending the settlement of the question of the establishment required in the Lunatic Asylums raised by the Government of India embodied in G.O., No. 860, Judicial, dated 26th April 1895 which was referred to me for my opinion. I submitted a report in my letter No. 536 T, dated 3rd August 1895. (3) Hospital Staff.My proposals regarding the entertainment of a special staff of attendants and toties, and also a special hospital kitchen establishment, was directed to lie over until the Government of India has dealt with the general question, but the recommendation made by me for the abolition of the appointments of two night watchmen on Rs. 8 each a month on duty in the male hospital was sanctioned. (4) Store-keeping Establishment.The proposal regarding the dispensation of the services of two lascars on Rs. 8 each a month was also sanctioned in the same order. (5) Accommodation for the third Apothecary and two European Attendants.-In my letters No. 544, dated 16th October 1894, and No. 642, dated 5th December 1894, I proposed that accommodation should be provided by building quarters for the third apothecary and for the two European attendants. In the order under reference, Government remarked that, as sanction was accorded for the substitution of a Hospital Assistant for the third Apothecary, there was no need for the construction of quarters for the latter, and it refused sanction to the grant of a conveyance allowance for him from the date of his appointment until the date of his transfer elsewhere; but sanction was given to house the new Hospital Assistant in a block of buildings known as the &quot; three rooms&quot; after certain alterations had been carried out. As regards the accommodation required for the two European attendants I proposed in my letter No. 17, dated 14th January 1895, to house them in existing buildings, if sanction is given to the proposal to construct a new house for the Superintendent; Government ordered, thereon, that pending the settlement of the question of building quarters outside the Asylum for the Superintendent the two attendants will continue receiving the house-rent which they are now drawing. (6) Pay of the Superintendent and accommodation for that officer.I recommended that the pay of the Superintendent should be fixed at Rs. 700-50,-1,400 and that he should be provided with quarters outside the Asylum compound in order to secure him from the annoyance inseparable from the occupation of a house situated in the immediate neighbourhood of the buildings occupied by the inmates of the institution. Government in the above order directed that the question of increasing the Superintendent's pay must lie over, until the disposal of the general question raised by the Government of India regarding the management of the Lunatic Asylums. As regards separate accommodation for the Superintendent, recommended in my letter No. 17, dated 14th January 1895, Government directed the Public Works Department to arrange for the preparation of plans and estimate in accordance with the design prepared by the Consulting Architect for tho house of the Warden of the Victoria Hostel. (7) Hospital accommodation.In my letter No. 2 T, dated 9th April 1895, I recommended that the present hospital for males situated in tho old criminal enclosure should be enlarged by breaking down the wall which separates it from tho noisy enclosure and utilising the buildings situated therein for hospital purposes, and further I proposed (a) to construct an additional block so as to accommodate twelve beds and to provide also a day-room for the nurses on duty, a store-room and a small room fitted with a stove and boiler for special cooking purposes somewhere
ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. about the centre of the dividing wall, which is to be broken down, (b) to connect all the buildings by covered passages, (c) to provide each ward block with a separate bath-room and a small latrine, and (a7) to lower the height of the surrounding walls of the hospital enclosure to eight feet. As regards provision of accommodation for the inmates of the present noisy enclosure, the abolition of which is involved in these proposals, I considered that this could best be done by erecting a walled enclosure with a light-roofed day shed in the south-east corner of the asylum grounds. Government having already sanctioned, in its Order No. 1501, Judicial, dated 19th June 1894, the erection of a shed of the kind, it remarked that all that is necessary, in addition, is to provide a small latrine, water tap and bathing platform, and to enclose the whole with a high wallpatients being housed at night in the general blocks. I proposed to add a small bath-room to the female hospital, to connect the latrine with the main building by a covered passage, to adapt block 74 for use as a room for the nurses by improving its lighting and ventilation and providing it with a small cooking stove and a boiler, and to complete the enclosure wall. These proposals have all been sanctioned in the order quoted under (6) and transferred to the Public Works Department to arrange for the preparation of the necessary plans and estimates. (8) Isolation hospital.I considered the present isolation blocks Nos. 113 and 114) used for patients suffering from contagious diseases of minor importance unsuitable for the treatment of cholera and small-pox cases, and proposed to provide for those more serious diseases a separate enclosure in the south-east corner of the grounds, in which four huts with accommodation for fourteen beds should be constructed together with a number of accessory buildings. Government approved of these proposals in the same order. (9) Management of insanes.In reviewing the administration reports of all the Lunatic Asylums in India the Surgeon-General with the Government of India remarked that the following points should receive increased attention in the management of the asylums. This was communicated to me with G.O., No. 2411, Judicial, dated 22nd November 1895. (i) Improved dietary, (ii) Better clothing for the convalescent and weak, (iii) Special means for heating those barracks occupied by the weakly and convalescent during cold-weather months, (iv) General introduction of means for affording amusements to insanes, (v) Selected patients to be allowed to walk outside the asylum walls, and (vi) Greater attention to be paid to the feeding and clothing of lunatics when they are in transit to the asylums. In consultation with the Superintendents of the Asylums, I shall submit a separate report. (10) Water-supply.Regarding the water-supply of the Madras Asylum, the Superintendent suggests that arrangements should be made to deliver Red Hill water filtered, so as to minimise the chances of introduction of epidemic diseases. This, I consider unnecessary, as long as the water for the general population of the town is unfiltered, he has power to boil the drmkhag water during epidemics of cholera if it is considered desirable. (11) Hospital dietary.The hospital diet scale sanctioned in G.O., No. 1 of 1889 was introduced in all the Asylums for the sick from the first of January of the year under report. (12) Recommendations.In the Madras Asylum the following recommendations have been sanctioned and carried out: (1) Number boards have been affixed to all the blocks; (2) The weak and sickly insanes were provided with woollen jerseys during the cold months; (3) The asphalt flooring of most of the blocks has been replaced by Portland cement; (4) Kerosine oil and Barton's burners have been introduced throughout the asylum; and 2
ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. (5) Rs. 50 has been sanctioned as a permanent advance for sanitary and other contingencies, under G.O., No. 917-A, Financial, dated 23rd November 1895, The recommendations of the Superintendent to have lines built for sweepers on the same plan as those of the native attendants have been sanctioned by Government in its Order No. 109, Judicial, dated 17th January 1896, referred to above. The recommendation for the erection of three day sheds, the roofing in of the kitchen court yard, the appointment of a second assistant steward are still under consideration, the proposal to provide the native attendants with uniforms at Government expense has not been sanctioned by Government. The Superintendent expresses great regret at the refusal of Government to sanction this last recommendation as he says, it will interfere with the enforcement of proper discipline. The recommendation of the Superintendent of the Calicut Asylum to have huts erected for boties and to construct a new kitchen is at present under reference. (13) Re-organization of lunatic asylums.The Hemp Drug Commission in their notes on the administration of the Lunatic Asylums in India pointed out certain defects, which, with the remarks of the Surgeon-General with the Government of India, were communicated to me in G.O., No. 860, Judicial, dated 26th April 1895 for my remarks. I have, in consultation with the several officers who had been superintendents of the asylum in this Presidency at one time or another and the superintendents in charge, submitted a report in my letter No. T-536, dated 3rd August 1895. (14) Inspection.I visited the asylum at Vizagapatam on the 9th January 1896, and entered the following remarks in the visitor's book: &quot; Much pleased with the general good order and careful management. The general health of the inmates is very good, only two males on the sick list out of sixty insanes. Their general condition shows that great care has been exercised in feeding them. The garden is kept in an admirable condition and the patients are employed in a very suitable manner. The hospital requires equipment up to the scale sanctioned for the Madras Asylum, if provision for this is not made in the current budget it should be done in the next one. More shelves are required in the different store-rooms. A zinc cover is required for the table in the mortuary. The isolation rooms in the hospital should not be used as store-rooms. As regards the kitchen .which is useless and unfit for the purpose, application should be made to the Public Works Department for an estimate and plan on the standard laid down for jails. The old hospital latrine should be adapted as a fuel store-room. Female sick can be dealt with either in one of their own cells or in one of the isolated rooms in the hospital. A wall round the garden is very desirable. Another cell for female violent cases should be requisitioned for. The inner wall of the criminal enclosure might be removed and the ward adapted for private paying patients. Provision must be made in the budget for the amusements of patients if necessary.&quot; The Madras Asylum was visited by me on several occasions and I entered the following remarks in the visitor's book on 13th September 1895 : &quot; Total inmates 459. The barracks and grounds are in good order. The suggestion of the Inspector-General of Prisons regarding the weighment statement will be adopted in the revised form. All who are found to be steadily losing weight are to be admitted into hospital.&quot; The Calicut Asylum was visited by me on the 29th February 1896, when I entered the following remarks in the visitor's book: &quot; Visited the asylum with the Superintendent. General sanitary state of asylum satisfactory. Some repairs and a latrine for the hospital are required, but have been postponed pending orders from Government. The patients look well and appear to be carefully looked after. The mortality last year (14) was high, but only three of them were from so-called preventible diseases. A chimney and fire place are required in the kitchen. I would like to see the garden work extended until the whole of the supplies of the vegetables and fruits are produced locally. Population to day males 75 and females 27, sick males 18 and females 4.&quot; (15) Code.During the year under report the asylum code has been completed and submitted to Government for approval.
ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 7 (16) Officers in charge.Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel A. H. Leapingwell was in charge of the Vizagapatam Asylum for nine months of the year; for the other three months Surgeon-Major Sarkies officiated for him while he was on privilege leave. Surgeon-Major Elcum was in charge of the Madras Asylum up to 9th March 1895, when Surgeon-Cap tain L. Palk took over and continued in charge until the end of the year. Surgeon-Major St. Clare Carruthers was in charge of the Calicut Asylum until the 28th October 1895, when Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel Hacket Wilkins took over and coutinued in charge until the end of the year. 3. Accommodation.There was no overcrowding in any of the asylums during the year. In the last year's report accommodation was said to exist in the Vizagapatam Asylum for 68 patients. Some single rooms and the hospital accommodation were not included in this, but including these there is accommodation for 75 males and 16 females. In the Madras Asylum the accommodation for criminal lunatics was reduced by the utilization of a general block for the purpose of cleaning grain. Government lias sanctioned the erection of a new block for increasing the accommodation for criminal lunatics. The Superintendent recommends that provision be made for special quarters for at least four male and two female paying patients. He has been directed to submit his reasons in full for this proposal. The accommodation in the Calicut Asylum was ample. 4. Buildings.Repairs executed (a).No repairs were executed in the Vizagapatam and Calicut Asylums except the annual minor repairs such as whitewashing, &c. In the Madras Asylum general repairs were executed to all the buildings in the asylum at a cost of Its. 4,288. The floor of the kitchen court yard was newly laid with granite slabs and some petty repairs to service pipes and leaky roofs were made. (b) State of repair.In Madras the buildings are in a good state of repair except that the asphalte flooring in many places is cracked and difficult to clean; the worst wards have been relaid in Portland cement. In the Vizagapatam and Calicut Asylums many repairs are required, but they are not undertaken pending the disposal by Government of the question of abolition of these two asylums. (c) Neiv constructions.In the Vizagapatam Asylum there was none. In the Madras Asylum two blocks of sixteen single rooms have been remodelled to such an extent as to justify its being classed as a new construction; a new wall has been built enclosing the female hospital, portion of the fuel godown was converted into a store-room for furniture, a permanent building for a carpenter's shop was erected, the walls of the latrines in the native attendants' quarters were rebuilt, and number boards affixed to all the buildings in the asylum. In the Calicut Asylum the iron grating over the wells commenced in the year 1894 was completed, and drains to the hospital ward and to the shed for refractory females were constructed. 5. Sanitation.Conservancy (a).In the Vizagapatam Asylum the dry-earth system was carried out. The day latrines (four in number) are used only during the monsoon, at other times a trench is used instead. In the Madras Asylum the Superintendent again points out this year- the difficulty he had in managing the work of the toties. There was a general strike amongst this class of servants which, the Superintendent, reports completely paralised the conservancy arrangements. The Government was addressed on this subject and in its Order No. 874, Judicial, dated 26th April 1895, directed that good-conduct pay of Re. 1 a month to be given to each man. Their working after the introduction of this has already been reported upon undor general administration. The latrine accommodation was ample and the dry-earth system was carried out throughout the year. In the Calicut Asylum in addition to the already existing staff of three male and two female toties a fourth male toty was appointed in accordance with the sanction given in G.O., No. 811, Judicial, dated 24th August 1895. Both tho dry-earth and flushing systems were carried on in the general latrines.
8 ANNUAL REPOET ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. (b) General hygiene of the insane.This has been well attended to in all the asylums. In the Madras Asylum the Superintendent remarks that many patients, were admitted in a terrible condition of emaciation and starvation, and they have all been attended to as well as possible. He has been directed to report what steps seem desirable to ensure their being taken care of en route to the asylums. Clothing is changed once a week. In special cases a woollen jersey is provided in cold months and baths, open-air exercise, &c, are well attended to. The cooked food has regularly been inspected by the superintendent and found to be satisfactory. (c) Drainage.The Vizagapatam Asylum has naturally a good drainage system being situated on a high and sloping ground. The drainage of Madras Asylum has been dealt within G.O., No. 351, Judicial, of the 21st February 1896, and the further information called for in it is now being prepared. All the buildings in the Calicut Asylum are provided with V-shaped masonry drains with the exception of the refractory shed for males. (d) Water-supply.In the Vizagapatam Asylum a sufficient supply of good water is obtained from a well in the asylum compound. In the Madras Asylum the water for drinking, cooking and washing purposes is obtained from the Red Hill supply, but for gardening, bathing, &c, well water is used. The free supply of 390*000 gallons of water by the Municipality was found to be quite insufficient for asylum purposes, and on a strong recommendation having been made the quantity was raised to 600,000 gallons, which is ample. This gives thirty gallons per head of the asylum population. In the Calicut Asylum the wells were repaired and the water-supply was fairly adequate, in summer, however, water for gardening purposes has to be taken from an adjacent tank. (e) Food and weighments.The diet of the insanes has been that sanctioned in CO., No. 1292, Judicial, dated 26th June 1893, in all the asylums. In the Vizagapatam Asylum cumbu and cholum were in use. Some of the patients long accustomed to rice refused this diet and had to be dieted on rice; the weak and feeble receive rice diet. In the Madras Asylum raggi has been the staple grain in use except in the cases of the insanes in feeble health and with poor digestive powers where rice has been substituted. The Superintendent reports that he has noticed some insanes in good health after being dieted on raggi for some time, grow thin and weakly, and that these men require careful observation. On the whole the use of the raggi diet has been more satisfactory last year in the Madras Lunatic Asylum than in the year previous ; this the Superintendent attributes to the greater care bestowed upon the cleaning and cooking of the grain. The husk was more thoroughly separated, which the iSuperintendent considers has greatly diminished the number of cases of diarrhoea and irritability of the bowels though he gives no figures to support this statement. The Superintendent thinks that the scale of diet laid down for Europeans is insufficient for an able-bodied European, but as it is equal to a full diet as allowed in the Presidency State Hospitals it appears sufficient. In Calicut rice was substituted for dry grains, and cocoanut oil for ghee in certain cases. Weighments.The results of weighments have been satisfactory in all the asylums. Fortnightly weighments have been carried out and the results sent to me. The following is the results of weighments in the Madras Asylum during the year: (1) (a) average number weighed ............ 420 (6) average number who gained weight ... ... ... 171 (c) Do. who lost weight ... ,..... 167 (d) Do. who remained stationary ...... 82 (2) Aggregate weight of those discharged during the year (a) weight on admission ... ... ... ... ... 10,384 lb.

(2) Those who have lost more than seven pounds since first admission. (3) Those who have been loosing weight in small amount for more than three successive weighment periods. (4) Those who have lost weight as compared with their greatest weight since admission. (/) Clothing.In the Vizagapatam Asylum each inmate is provided with two suits of clothing ; for males, jackets, breaches, caps and longooties ; and for females, a cloth six yards long. For bedding they are provided with a coir mat, date mat, pillow and cumbly each. In the Madras Asylum the Superintendent reports that the clothing has been sufficient and good. Cotton materials are used throughout the year and woollen cumblies at night from October to March. The sick and the feeble among the European inmates get a flannel banian, and the natives a woollen jersey. This last item has been introduced newly during the year and the Superintendent reports that it has served the purpose very well. There is another class of insanes who will not tolerate any kind of clothing and the only way, the Superintendent says, of keeping them warm is by building twenty single rooms which can be kept warm by a system of hot water pipes. This has been recommended by the Sanitary Commissioner but I do not think the necessity for it has been clearly made out. In the Calicut Asylum each inmate gets three suits of clothing, and during the monsoon those in feeble health get cumbly jackets; the clothing used was of the asylum manufacture. (g) Industries and. Employments.In the Vizagapatam Asylum the industries remained the same as in the last year, viz., cloth weaving, tape making, garden and farm work, cleaning and pounding grains, &c, with the addition of tin work &quot;which was commenced during the year under report. Seventy-four 'per cent, of the inmates were employed throughout the year. The hours of labour were from 7 to 10 a.m. and 2 to 5 p.m. In the Madras Asylum weaving of cloth and the cultivation of vegetables formed the chief employments ; Rs. 738 was realised by the sale of asylum manufactured cloths. Of minor industries there have been straw hat making and mat plaiting. The oakum picking, which was commenced in the year previous and which formed a very suitable employment for the weakly insanes, was stopped in April 1895, as the officer in charge of the Madras Arsenal arranged to have the work done by military prisoners at Bangalore free of wages and there was no other demand for it. The insanes were employed in the kitchen in the preparation of grain, in the laundry, in the smithy, as tailors, and some were employed as orderlies; 09*51 per cent, of the asylum population were employed throughout tho year which is good, considering that the average daily sick was 89 3
10 ANNUAt REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. for the year. In the asylum at Calicut drawing and carrying water, cleaning the asylum compound and picking up leaves, &c, formed the chief employments; some have been made to do tailoring work while the females were employed in thrashing and weaving coir and poundiDg rice. Coir-mat weaving was begun during the year. (//) Amusements.In the Yizagapatam Asylum the annual treat was given by the District Judge and the Superintendent. On every Saturday noon a Brahmin priest and a barber have been specially engaged to sing and play. Besides these, cards, native chess, drums, and cymbals are provided. Some of the reliable patients are sent out in carts with warders in charge whenever possible, and almost daily two men have been sent out to sell vegetables grown at the asylum. In the Madras Asylum monthly and annual treats with music and refreshments have been provided and formed the chief sources of amusement for the insanes. A fair proportion of the European patients are kept occupied by newspapers and books from the library. In Calicut treats are given to the inmates on festival days; besides this, they amuse themselves during leisure hours, i.e., between 10 a.m.' and 2 p.m. by playing the country game called * Kollatam' with sticks and drums. 6. Asylum population.(&laquo;) Remaining.There were 623 patients remaining under treatment on the 1st January 1895, vide column 2 of Statement No. I. (b) Admissions and re-admissions,There were 211 admissions and 10 re-admissions making a total of 221 during the year, vide columns 3 and 4 of Statement I. (c) Discharges.There were 126 discharges of all kinds during the year, vide column 6 D of Statement I. In the Madras Asylum the number of recoveries is the highest on record for the last decade, excepting the year 1886; 70 patients are returned as recovered. The principle of treatment has been chiefly moral; kindness, firmness and employment in an avocation most congenial to the patient. (d) Escapes.There was no escape from the Vizagapatam Asylum. From the Madras Asylum a native criminal lunatic escaped on the 21st October 1895 and has not been captured up to date, the matter was reported to the Police immediately ; the attendant who was responsible for keeping the gate of the enclosure of the criminal ward was punished. From the Calicut Asylum there were two escapes and in the both cases the insanes were recaptured ; the keepers in fault in both instances were fined and warned. (e) Religions, Races and Castes.

Of the 221 new admissions during the year, 179 were males and 42 females. (g) Occupation.These are fully dealt with in Statement IVthe largest number of admissions being from the cooly class in Madras and Calicut and from the servant class in Vizagapatam. (h) Ages.The largest number of admissions in all the asylums were between the ages of 20 and 40 as usual. The details will be seen in Statement V. {i) Types of insanity.Mania shows the largest number, next comes melancholia and then dementia. Vide Statement VI. (j) Causes of insanity.Statement VII deals with this clearly. Hereditary-taint, previous attack, ganja smoking, starvation, and privation, formed the chief causes. In accordance with the Government of India No. 12, Medical, 525,
ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 11 Home Department, dated 31st July 1895, the whole of the columns under moral causes have been shown under one heading ' moral causes' without any attempt at particularization. All the Superintendents strongly mention the difficulties they have to put up with in finding out the proper causes of insanity in each case partly owing to the inaccurate and unreliable nature of the history of the cases sent to them by Magistrates and some medical men. 7. Criminal population and their sub-divisions.In the Vizagapatam Asylum the same man who was admitted as a criminal lunatic last year was released after a security had been taken from his friends, but a few days after that he was brought back again suffering from mania and was transferred to the Madras Asylum. In the Madras Asylum at the beginning of the year there were 159 criminal insanes and 45 were admitted during the year, making a total of 204. Of these IS were discharged, transferred, &c, 26 died and 160 remained at the end of the yearvide Statement II. The high mortality amongst this class is accounted for by the epidemic of cholera in 1894 and 1895. There were no criminal lunatics at Calicut during the year. 8. Hospital accommodation. In the Vizagapatam Asylum there was accommodation for 13 males, but none for females. The single rooms in the female enclosure are used for this purpose whenever required but are not specially adapted for the purposes of a hospital. The various proposals regarding hospital accommodation in the Madras Asylum have been dealt with in paragraph 2, under Administration. In Calicut there is hospital accommodation for 12 males and a cell in the female enclosure, which is used as hospital, gives accommodation for 8 females. 9. Sickness and its causes.In the Vizagapatam Asylum 116 patients were treated in all. The average daily sick was 11*49 against 7*82 in 1894. This rise in the average was due to some chronic cases being under treatment throughout the year. The general health of the insanes was good. Of the total treated, 96 were discharged cured, 2 relieved, 2 died, 4 re-admitted for other diseases and 12 remained at the end of the year. The largest number admitted was for fevers (35 in number), mania caused 9 admissions, their violence and refusal to take food necessitating special treatment. In the Madras Asylum the total number of admissions were 718 as compared with 1,042 in 1894. The largest number of admissions were as follows : Itch 139, mania 136, cholera 56, surfeit 54, epileptic insanity 23, and melancholia 20. The daily average sick for the year 1895 was 89 against 82 of the previous year. This increase in the daily average is due to the fact that there were 179 cases of mental diseases admitted which had to be kept in hospital for a longer time than most of the other cases. In the Calicut Asylum the total number treated in hospital during the year was 112 with a daily average sick of 22*57 against 15*07 in 1894. This rise in the average was due to the admission of all weakly insanes into the hospital. 10. Forcible feeding*In the Vizagapatam Asylum there were nine cases of forcible feeding. Of these six were fed by hand and three had to be fed by the oesophageal tube. In Madras forcible feeding was resorted to on 193 occasions. The methods employed were by the nasal tube 140 times, and by enemata per rectum 53 times. In the Calicut Asylum six males and five females were regularly fed by hand and two males had to be fed by the nasopharyngeal tube. 11. Mortality and its causes.Each death with the details of the case is reported at tho time for my information. There were two deaths in the Vizagapatam Asylum, one from chronic pneumonic phthisis and tho other from cirhosis of liver and dropsy. In the Madras Asylum there were 94 ; of these, 37 deaths were caused by tho epidemic of cholera which extended to the first few weeks of the year under report, excluding these cases, therefore, there were 57 deaths in Madras, which is 129*49 per mille of the average daily population. The disoases that caused the mortality were cholera 37, tubercle of lung 13, mania 8, dysentery 7, and starvation 5. In the Calicut Asylum there were 14 deaths
12 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. against 6 of the previous year. Of these 3 were received into the asylum in a moribund condition. 12. Epidemics and how they were dealt with.In the Vizagapatam and Calicut Asylums there were no epidemics.. In the Madras Asylum the cholera which broke out at the end of 1894 continued until the 9th February 1895, caused as stated above 37 deaths in the year under report. In addition to this there was a mild outbreak of small-pox. There were six cases, all of them being females. They all recovered. Isolation, disinfection, and vaccination and re-vaccination of all the unprotected cases were at once attended to. 13. Injuries received in the Asylums.In the Vizagapatam Asylum there were eight self-inflicted injuries, four inflicted by other insanes, one case of a doubtful nature. The last one was a simple fracture of the lower jaw on a chronic maniac. This man, on inquiry was said to have struggled hard with two warders who had called another patient to their assistance but when the injury occurred was not known. The warders were punished. The other cases were all of a trivial nature. In the Madras Asylum no self-inflicted injury occurred during the year. A few instances of scalp-wounds, &c, caused by insanes on each other, occurred; these were all very slight. The only serious injury that occurred was to a criminal lunatic who climbed up a tamarind tree, fell down and fractured his left thigh, he recovered from this. In the Calicut Asylum there were five or six cases of minor injuries inflicted by insanes on each other. On one occasion a female keeper and a male toty had to be fined Us. 2 and 1, respectively, for neglecting two patients. 14. Hospital diets and extras.In all the asylums the diet scale laid down in G.O., No. 1, Public, dated 1st January 1889, was in use. The following table exhibits the average cost of each diet of different classes both paying and non-paying insanes and hospital diets : Asylums. Paying i nsanes. Ordinary Insanes. Hospital Diet.

None. 0 3 5 None. 0 2 2 None. 0 3 7f In the Madras Asylum the Superintendent reports that this scale of diet, though it has increased the expenditure on diet and extras, has come up to the expectations formed of it. Considering the very miserable condition in which patients were constantly being received into the asylum, the Superintendent says the expenditure should be considered small, as it requires great care to diet them properly. In Calicut all weekly patients have been placed on hospital diets. The cost of diet has been high, Rs. 2,051-3-6 against Rs. 825 in the year 1894. This heavy rise in expenditure is accounted for as due to an increased number of sick and weakly patients being placed on hospital diet; the average daily sick rose from 15*07 to 22'57. The Superintendent reports that this scale of diets suits the patients well and, though expensive, does away with the necessity for extras. The extras in the year 1894 cost Rs. 428-5-4, whereas in the year 1895 they cost only Rs. 177-12-2. . 15. Nursing of the sick.In Vizagapatam the nursing of the sick has been carried out by the ordinary attendants under the supervision of the Hospital Assistant. In Madras there was no trained nursing establishment during the year under report, the current year has started with two trained nurses, and the nursing of the sick was consequently very unsatisfactory, inasmuch as it had to be done by ordinary native attendants who are, as a rule, a very unreliable set of men. In Calicut the sick are nursed during the day by an attendant specially detailed for the purpose, and during the night, by the watchman on duty, but under the supei'* vision of the Resident Hospital Assistant,
ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 13 16. Establishment (&laquo;)In the Vizagapatam Asylum, during the year, a temporary male attendant had to be taken on owing to the increase in strength. In the Madras Asylum Surgeon-Captain Palk endorses the opinion of his predecessor in stating that the steward's department is greatly undermanned, fhe matter is still under the consideration of the Government. The work of the matron and the assistant matron is reported to have been satisfactory. The European attendants are reported to have performed their duties fairly well. In the Asylum at Calicut the staff has done its work satisfactorily. (b) Hosjrital.In Vizagapatam, there is no special establishment except a Hospital Assistant who resides in the premises. In Madras the Superintendent lays great stress on having trained native orderlies on higher pay to look after the sick instead of the ordinary attendants. About the hospital medical staff, he writes in satisfactory terms and states that he considers Civil Apothecary Noronha to be very well up in his profession and of Hospital Assistant A. Dorasawmy Pillay as having done his work satisfactorily. 17. Notes On visitors' reports.The Madras Asylum was visited by the official visitors once every month. The only point to note regarding their reports is their remark on the state of the disrepair of the roads of the asylum generally, this question is still under disposal. The Inspector-General of Prisons visited the asylum on the 2nd March 1895 and suggested the registration of gain or loss in pounds from admission weight in connection with the weighment statement; the form has been rectified in accordance with his suggestions. The Sanitary Commissioner visited the asylum on 13th December 1895 and remarked about the want of an arrangement for flushing the blocks with water under pressure, the necessity for an artificially heated room and the deficiency of latrine accommodation; all these subjects have been or are being dealt with. 18. Finance.The total receipts during the year amounted to Es. 1,20,088-4-6 against Rs. 1,22,458-3-7 and were from the following sources: Particulars. 1894. 1895.

P. 155 15 2 74 10 0 I From the above table it will be seen that there has been a satisfactory decrease of expenditure per head under the headings of establishment and diet in the Madras and Vizagapatam asylums and a slight decrease in Calient. The charges under bedding and clothing in the Madras and Calicut asylums show an increase, which the Superintendent of Madras Asylum explains as due to the fact that the stock of bedding and clothing both cotton and woollen has been raised considerably to cope efficiently with the wants of the asylum, a sum of Hs. 400 having been spent on woolhm jerseys and flannel banyans alone. The Superintendent, Calicut, in whose asylum the increase has been very high, explains the fact as having been due to a large number of cumblies being purchased from the Jail department at an increased price. In the Vizagapatam Asylum there has been a slight decrease over last year. The increased expenditure under medicines in the Madras Asylum is due to the adjustment of the cost of two years' supply, viz., 1894 and 1895 having been made in the year under report. There has been a very considerable increase under the heading contingencies in the Madras Asylum; this is satisfactorily explained by the Superintendent as having been due to (1) the payment of Rs. 3,588-9-8 on account of two years' taxes, that for 1894 having been paid in arrears; (2) funeral expeuses,extra servants, &c, during the cholera epidemic;
ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 15 (3) cost of excess of water used during the year; (4) cost of amusement and recreation of insanes (which is an item newly included); (5) travelling charges incurred on patients discharged which have been larger than for several years past; and (6) repairs to the cooking range. The very slight increase under contingencies jn the Vizagapatam Asylum calls for no special comment. Under the heading hospital necessaries and miscellanies there has been a slight increase both in Madras and Calicut Asylums. This was due to the purchase of extra furniture, the substitution of railway pattern commodes in Madras and some other sundry items.

The amount received varied from Rs. 15 to one rupee per mensem. The total amount received was Rs. 316-15-6; this includes Es. 51, arrears for 1894.

In the Calicut Asylum there were six paying patients during the year with an average strength of 3*72, of these three were sepoys. Manufactures.Out of an average population of 602*94 against 621*27 of the previous year, 357*75 inmates against 40409 of the year 1894 were employed daily on manufactures consisting of weaving, gardening and farming with the result that there was a profit of Rs. 4,622-13-3 against Rs. 1,891-2-11 of the last year.

Garden-produce.The income under this item showed a very satisfactory increase.

ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 17 The Superintendent of the Vizagapatam Asylum reports as follows : &quot; The credit of this satisfactory condition of the asylum is due to Hospital Assistant Anantayya, No. 326, in charge. I have on previous occasions brought his good work to notice. I selected him to the post three and a half years ago, -when th9 condition of the asylum was most unsatisfactory. Since taking over charge of the asylum, he has never been a day oft&quot; duty, and at whatever hour I visit the asylum, I find him busy among the patients; the figures given above shows the saving he has effected in diet by the timely purchase of grains and other articles, often at considerable personal trouble. The asylum grounds have been greatly improved and a considerable portion brought under cultivation.&quot; The Superintendent further states that the three and a half years' experience in the asylum has made this man a very valuable assistant, and suggests that Government would be pleased to make a note of their approval of his services and sanction a special allowance for him. The fact is that by long service in the asylum he is losing touch with the profession and the income from private practice which a man of his energy and zeal is sure to have if he were to be put in charge of a hospital or dispensary. Madras Asylum.Surgeon-Captain Palk writes : &quot; I find that the duties of my position are too numerous and too responsible for me to be able to say that things are in every way satisfactory. I thoroughly agree in all my predecessors have said and whose reports I have read. The tremendous variety of details is more than one man can really work efficiently, and I find one has to go on a certain amount of trust, otherwise one's work would take up the whole twenty-four hours. In this asylum one has to spend all his time in office work in supervising the duties of the staffs generally in their work of looking after the feeding, clothing, employment and amusement of the insanes ; in looking to the sanitation, repair and cleanliness of the buildings; in checking, condemning and renewal of stock ; in buying grain, &c, and supervising the storekeeper's department, in constantly looking into the manufactures of the asylum and the sale of saleable articles, in examining and checking the financial transactions connected with this large institution and many other duties too many to be detailed here. In addition to these, the Superintendent has to attend to his professional and strictly medical duties in attendance on a daily average of from 80 to 100 sick men and women in hospital and their many requirements. As a result, the medical duties being less urgent have of necessity to be delegated to a large extent to the junior apothecary, and the Superintendent has to almost forget his position as a medical man and become to all intents and purposes a steward and clerk. One of the easiest ways of overcoming this difficulty would be to have an additional commissioned medical officer as an assistant to the Superintendent, whom I propose should be selected from the new drafts of Indian Medical officers who come out from England, twice yearly and who could hold the appointment for six months while he is preparing for his Hindustani examination. By this means, the Government would be put to no extra expense, and the distaste and monotony of the appointment of Superintendents would be materially reduced.&quot; This would be an admirable plan if the services of an officer who had completed his two years' military duty could be spared, but would scarcely be satisfactory to the officer concerned, who wrould spend his time on his grade rate of pay, learning administrative work in a line in which there were no prospects for him. The only way I see to relieve the medical Superintendent of such duties is to give him more efficient non-professional subordinates as already proposed by me. Surgeon-Captain Palk has done admirable work since he was appointed to the charge of the asylum. The Superintendent writes concerning Military Assistant Surgeon Judge,&quot; This officer has been of inestimable help and value to me : the burden of the office work falls on his shoulders. His staunchness to the sense of duty, his firmness of will and his courtesy have made his presence here invaluable.&quot; The Steward,&quot; He has performed his duties satisfactorily in every way aa far as he himself is concerned, but his department I consider unsatisfactory
18 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. owing to the heavy and ever increasing work put into his charge. This servant has been here for over twenty-four years and has laboured well, and were it not that he is so conversant with the ways of this institution and his work, I am confident that, with the great increase of work during the last few years in the shape of books, returns and increase in the accounts, he would have broken down. I have seen and am thoroughly convinced that without the assistance of an extra hand things cannot go on satisfactorily. He is to my mind most inadequately paid in regard to his long service and the heavy and responsible nature of his duties.&quot; Assistant Steward*McKenzie has performed his work satisfactorily. The details of his duty have been given in the last year's report.&quot; European Attendants.&quot;There were three first-class and three second-class men in the asylum. Their work, I consider, has been, on the whole, satisfactory. My predecessor proposed a reserve of these men in order to allow of a fixed annual holiday for each of them. This suggestion I again bring forward with my strong recommendation. They are on duty daily from 5-30 a.m., to 5-30 p.m. and on' two nights out of six have to make two tours of the asylum between 9 p.m. and 4 a.m.&quot; Native Attendants.&quot; On the whole, T have found them very poor ; they are unintelligent, dishonest, untruthful, uneducated and untrustworthy. Pensioned sepoys when available make far and away the best native attendants, but are not always procurable or willing to do the heavy work here. I therefore strongly urge that, the sanction for having trained orderlies in place of native attendants by giving them a little higher pay may be obtained.&quot; I believe that if we are to get efficient men, they must be paid better and all put through a regular course of training in nursing and dealing with insanes. The Superintendent of the Calicut Asylum speaks highly of second-class keeper Iyappen, through whose care the profits under manufacture have increased a great deal and considers he should be better paid. He also points out the necessity of having more night watchmen, as the two men now employed have too hard work. All of these subjects will be dealt with when the orders of Government on the reorganisation of the asylums are received. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, C. SIBTHORPE, Surgeon-Major-General, Surgeon-General with the Government of Madras.

No. 983, Judicial, 8th June L806. GOVERNMENT OF MADRAS. JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT. EAD__letter from the Surgeon-General, No. T5-A, dated 15th April 1896. OrderNo. 983, Judicial, dated 8th June 1896. The report on the administration of the Lunatic Asylums of this Presidency during 1895 was submitted with punctuality. The arrangement of the matter in it appears, however, to be capable of improvement. In some instances, e.g., paragraphs [) (r/) and 5 (/^), subjects are placed under inappropriate headings ; in others, e.g., paragraphs 3 and 6, kindred matters are separated by discussions of questions to which they bear no relation ; and in others information upon a clearly denned branch of the administration is scattered over several places in the report in a manner which renders any general view of the subject difficult of attainment. Examples of this last defect ave to be found in the treatment of the statistics of health, and of the subject of manufactures. The Surgeon-General will be requested to divide his future reports under the four main headings of (1) Population and accommodation, (2) Statistics of health and treatment of the sick, (3) Finance (including manufactures) and (4) General, comprising such matters as do not come within the other three divisions, and to deal with each aspect of the administration in its appropriate place under these headings. 2. Population and Accommodation.The following table compares the statistics of the population of the asylums for the last two years : Population at beginning of year. Ad missions. Discharged. Died. Remaining at end oi year. Year. &quot;c3 =8 CD &quot;3 &#9632; &quot;&gt; a 1 13 d 3 3 urel impro p CD *c3 X* a 1 o d &gt; rimin: O o H o o H O o H O o H o O * 1894 434 150 584 178 44 222 91 28 119 50 14 64 463 160 623 1895 463 160 623 175 46 221 104 22 126 84 26 110 448 160 608 The high proportion borne by the civil to the criminal population continued. The Surgeon-General will be requested to take active steps during the course of the year to ascertain whether some appreciable number of the civil lunatics who are harmless cannot be handed over to their friends and relations. It appears to His Excellency in (Jouucil that the State is at present maintaining many of this class who should properly bo taken charge of by their families and who would bo happier with them than in an asylum. In Bengal the criminal lunatics form more than one-half of the whole asylum population. The proportion is much smaller in this Presidency. In this connection the attention of all District Magistrates will be drawn to the necessity of making sure, before sending a lunatic to an asylum, that such a course is really necessary for the public well-being. From cases which have recently come to notice it appears that this is not always done. It will be observed that though the year opened with thirty-nine more inmates in the three institutions than did 1894, and admissions hardly varied at all, yet an increase in the number of discharges and a great advance in the deaths reduced the population at the end of the year to fifteen less than in the preceding year . The advance in the number of insanes who were discharged cured, which occurred mainly iu the Madras asylum, and was the highest figure but one recorded in the previous decade, appears to point to increased care there. The increase in the number of deaths is dealt with below.
No. 983, Judicial, 8th June 1896. The numbers of the insanes admitted who belonged to the several religious communities remained almost the same as in 1894 as did the proportion between the two sexes. Madras city (32) and the district of Yizagapatam (18) provided the largest number of admissions. This fact appears to indicate that in districts in which there are lunatic asylums admissions are ordered more freely than is really necessary. There were similarly no less than 52 admissions from the two West Coast districts for which the Calicut asylum is conveniently near. The attention of the District Magistrates concerned will be drawn to the matter. The entries for the Madras asylum in column 1 of Statement No. 3, which is headed &quot; Districts,&quot; are made in a very unsystematic way. Figures for Wynaad, Tellicherry, Cannauore and Calicut all of which are in Malabar district, are given, and in another place figures for the rest of the district. Similarly, separate entries are made under Birmingham, Cheshire London and England. Lunatics admitted from this Presidency should be shown under the several districts only and those from elsewhere should be classified according to the country, administration, or Native State from which they come. Turning to the previous occupations of those admitted, it is seen that, as usual, a large proportion of them were cultivators, cooly carriers, labourers, beggars and servants. In 1894 fifteen agricultural labourers and one unskilled labourer were returned as admitted. In 1895 the entries under these heads are respectively one and twelve. Apparently the system of classification under these items is not uniform. Mania was the type of insanity from which most of the patients were suffering. Melancholia and dementia come next. The causes of insanity were believed to have been discovered in 87 per cent, of the cases admitted and in 73 per cent, of all those under treatment, but His Excellency in Council entertains considerable doubt as to the accuracy of these diagnoses. It is observed that of the new admissions the largest numbers are declared to be suffering from insanity due to ganja-smoking, hereditary taint and starvation. In the face of the discovery made by the Hemp Drugs Conmiission of the extreme inaccuracy with which ganja-smoking was assigned as a cause of lunacy and of the rarity of genuine cases of the kind, and in view of the small consumption in this Presidency of preparations of hemp, Government finds itself unable to credit the statement that ganja-smoking was the cause of more cases of lunacy in 1895 than anything else. Again, the large number of cases said to be due to starvation suggests the inference that an effect of insanity may frequently have been mistaken for its cause, and that the starvation brought upon an insane by his inability to earn his living or to obtain or to eat sufficient suitable food may have been entered as the reason for his insanity. It seems highly probable that insufficient care is devoted by medical officers to the diagnosis of the causes of insanity when drawing up medical history sheets of lunatics to be admitted to asylums, and the Surgeon-General will be requested to issue the necessary instructions upon this matter to the officers of his department upon whom this duty falls. The accommodation in all three asylums was sufficient throughout the year. 3. Health.The statement following compares the health of the inmates of the three asylums in the last two years: Year.

No. 983, Judicial, 8th June 1896. The rise in the daily average sick-rate in the three asylums is explained by the Surgeon-General to have been due, in Madras, to the prolonged retention in hospital of a considerable number of patients suffering only from mental disease ; in Vizagapatam to the treatment of certain chronic cases ; and in Calicut to the admission into hospital of all weakly inmates. The year was also in some respects unhealthy. At Calicut the deaths numbered fourteen against six in 189J, but they do not appear to have arisen from preventible causes. The great increase in the mortality at the Madras asylum was due to the occurrence of 37 deaths from cholera in the epidemic to which allusion was made in the last annual review. Excluding these, however, the percentage of deaths in the three asylums taken together was higher than in 1893 or 1&94, being 12&quot; 1 against 11'69 and 10*30, respectively. A slight epidemic of smallpox occurred in the Madras asylum. The Surgeon-General will be requested to state if it has been possible to trace the manner in which the disease was conveyed into the institution. Eighteen patients were admitted to hospital in the same asylum for tubercle of the lung, of whom thirteen died. No cases of this disease occurred in 1894, and the Surgeon General will be good enough to report whether any explanation of the increase is forthcoming and whether it is merely owing to changes in the nomenclature of diseases or was in his opinion due to the effects of dampness or insufficient clothing or bedding. Ten deaths occurred in Madras from starvation and anaemia (they appear to have been classified indifferently under either head) as against twelve in 1894. Some particulars of these would have been of interest. It is observed that there were four cases in which insanes were injured by their fellow-patients. The Government trusts that these occurrences are not traceable to insufficient care on the part of the attendants. 4.

The figures given in paragraph 18 of the Surgeon-General's report show that there were on the whole considerable decreases hi the expenditure under establishment and diet, but the causes of these are left unexplained. In both cases they occurred almost entirely in Madras. The fall in the cost of diet is probably due to the reduction in the price of food-grains which took place during the year. The Surgeon-General will be requested to report whether efforts were made to purchase stocks of grain when the market was favourable. It seems from a passage in the Superintendent's report that this was effected in Vizagapatam, but it does not appear that attention was paid to the matter at the other two asylums. The expenditure under contingencies and medicines is obscured by the fact that in Madras, for reasons which have not been explained, the payments for medicines and municipal taxes were allowed to fall into arrears and charges properly belonging to 1894 woro paid in 1895. The cost under clothing and bedding was increased by unusual purchases at the same asylum. These exceptional charges resulted in an increase in the expenditure per head of average strength in Madras, which would otherwise have fallen somewhat. The expenditure in the other two asylums showed a decline, and this was again particularly noticeable in Vizagapatam. The Government continues in the opinion that the expenditure upon diets in Madras and Calicut is oapable of further reduction. The presence of Europeans in the former asylum uo doubt tends to raise the average cost per head, but it does not appear to afford a
4 No. 983, Judicial, 8th June 1896. reason why it should continue to be considerably more than twice as much as at Viza-gapatam. At Calicut this excuse cannot be advanced, and yet the expenditure there averages Rs. 60 per head against Us. 25 at Vizagapatama fact which calls lor the serious consideration of the Surgeon-General. It is not understood why three suits of clothing per annum are provided for the inmates at Calicut, while only two are furnished at Vizagapatam. In the absence of special reasons to the contrary, it is desirable that the rule should be uniform. The statistics of manufactures are given in paragraph 18 of the Surgeon-General's report. Out of a daily average strength of 59 inmates in the Vizagapatam asylum, on an average 25 were employed, and they earned a profit of h's. 46 each. This is the best result on record and is again highly creditable to the Superintendent. In Calicut, on the other hand, only 27 out of a strength of 103 were employed and the profit earned by each fell from lis. 28 to Es. 24, and in Madras, although 30b out of a total strength of 440 were employed, they only succeeded in earning Rs. 9 per head. Except that the fall at Calicut in the average profit earned is partly accounted for, the Surgeon-General's report contains no explanation of these remarkable variations, although his special attention was called to the matter in the last annual review. He will now be requested to report why a larger proportion of the inmates at Calicut were not employed, and the causes which led to the earnings per head of those at Madras being only abuut one-fifth of the figure realised at Vizagapatam. The importance of encouraging manufactures consists, not only in the fact that the cost to the tax-payer of maintaining the asylums is thereby slightly decreased, but in the consideration that the inmates can in this manner be assisted on the way to the recovery of their mental powers by being provided with regular employment of a more or less interesting kind instead of being compelled to spend day after day in wearisome inaction in their cells or lounging about the grounds. 5. General.Of the various matters alluded to by the Surgeon-General in the course of his report, orders have already been passed as to the rules for the care of lunatics in transit, as to the toty lines at Madras, and as to the appointment of an assistant steward there. The questions of the abolition of the two smaller asylums, of the revision of the code of rules, of the scale of establishment in the institutions, of increasing the pay of the Superintendent at Madras and building him new quarters, and of providing further forms of amusement for the inmates of the asylums, are still under the consideration of Government. Surgeon-Captain Palk appears to have worked with much energy to bring the Madras Lunatic Asylum into better order. The thanks of His Excellency the Governor in Council are due to Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel A. H. Leapingwell for his excellent administration of the asylum at Vizagapatam, the features of which have already been noticed. His Excellency also observes with pleasure his testimony to the good work done by the hospital assistant in charge there. The Surgeon-General's recommendation in his favour should form the subject of a separate communication. The management of the other two asylums progressed during the year, but. as pointed out above, there remains considerable scope for further improvement in them. (True Extract.) J. F.

SIBTHORPB, f.r.c.p.l, Surgeon-General with the Government of Madras, To The Hon'ble The CHIEF SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Public Department. Sir, I have the honour to submit to His Excellency the Governor in Council the annual report on the working of the Lunatic Asylums in the Presidency for the year 1896. 2. The report has been prepared according to the directions contained in G.O., No. 983, Judicial, dated 8th June 1896. I.-POPULATION AND ACCOMMODATION. (a) Asylum population (1) Remaining.There were 608 patients remaining under treatment on the 1st January 1896vide column 2 of Statement I, (2) Admissions and. re-admissions.There were 152 admissions and 4 re-admissions, making a total of 156 against 221 in the previous yearvide columns 3 and 4 of Statement I. (3) Discharges.There were 134 discharges of all kinds during the year vide column 6 D of Statement I. (4) Results of treatment.Of the 134 patients discharged, 95 were cured and 39 were discharged otherwise. Of those belonging to the latter class, 31 were handed over to their friends (15 improved, 16 unbenefited), 1 was transferred to England and 7 to the civil list. The treatment in all the asylums consisted mainly of attention to general hygienic principles, with some kind of amusement or occupation congenial to the patient. Of medicinal treatment, the use of trional and the hypodermic injection of hyoysamine for maniacal excitement, were attended with much benefit. The only case of clinical interest was in the Madras Asylum. A man with strangulated inguinal hernia was operated on and made a successful recovery in spite of his being subject to repeated violent attacks of acuto maniacal excitement. (5) Escapes.There was no escape from the Madras Asylum. There were two escapes from the Calicut Asylum and two from tlie Asylum at Vizagapatam. All the four were recaptured. The warders responsible for their safe custody were warned, fined or suspended according to the gravity of their offence.

Of the 156 admitted during the year, 128 were males and 28 were females. (8) Occupation.Of the 156 admissions, the occupations of 152 were known and of 4 were unknown. The largest number of admissions was from the cooly class in Madras and from the cultivating classes in Calicut and Vizagapatam. These are fully dealt with in Statement IV. (9) Ages.The details are given in Statement V. The largest number of admissions in all the asylums were, as usual, between the ages of 20 and 40being 109 out of 156. (10) Types of insanity.Of the 156 admissions, 135 were admitted for mania, 10 for melancholia, 4 for idiocy, and 7 for all other typesvide Statement VI. (11) Causes of insanity.Of the admissions during the year, 103 were due to physical causes and 30 to moral causes, the cause in the remaining 23 being unknown.vide Statement VII. (12) Criminal population and their sub-divisions.In the Madras Asylum 160 criminal lunatics remained on the 1st January 1896 and 32 were admitted during the }7ear, making a total of 192. There were fewer admissions and more discharges than in the previous year, while the mortality was less than half of that of 1895. Of the 32 admissions under this class, 10 were tried and acquitted prisoners, 14 were under-trial prisoners incapable of making a defence, and 8 were cases that became insane during confinement in jail. One criminal lunatic was transferred from the Asylum at Madras to that at Vizagapatam and was detained there till his friends took charge of him on security bond. There was no criminal insane during the year in the Calicut Asylum. (b) Accommodation (1) There was no overcrowding in any of the asylums. In the Madras Asylum there was accommodation for 689, while the largest number confined on any one night was 447. With an accommodation for 91 patients in the Asylum at Vizagapatam, the highest number on any one night was 73. In Calicut the greatest number confined on any one night was 106, while there was accommodation for 135. The insufficiency of special accommodation in the Madras Asylum, referred to by the Superintendent in his last year's report, will not, he thinks, weigh so heavily in future, in consequence of the new scale of stoppages for patients in the special wards' as fixed by Government in its order, No. 434, Public, dated 31st March 1896, which the Superintendent considers as prohibitive. No admissions have occurred in the ' special wards' during the past year. (2) New constructions.The only new works in the Madras Asylum were the sinking of a well in the criminal enclosure and the construction of a masonry drain in the native attendants' lines (sanctioned in G.O., No. 883, Judicial, dated 19th May 1896). Additions and improvements to the criminal enclosures, male and female hospitals and to the isolation enclosure have been sanctioned for execution when funds are available.
ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. Revised estimates will be submitted when ready in accordance with G.O., No. 1701, Judicial, dated 2oth October 1896, as regards day and feeding sheds, covered passages, bath rooms and latrines for the hospitals, lean-to-shed for attendants and huts for sweepers and horse-keepers. The question of the necessity for a quarantine-block of six cells forms still the subject of correspondence between this office and the Superintendent. In the Calicut Asylum the drain work for the hospital and th9 female refractory block which were begun in 1895, were completed and paid for during the year. The flooring of the latrines in the male and criminal wards and a pucka shed for storing dry earth in proximity to the latrine in the male ward were also taken up and completed during the year. There was no new construction in the asylum at Vizagapatam. (3) Repairs executed.In Madras the repairs comprised the taking up of the cracked asphalte floors of several of the general blocks and single rooms and replacing the same by Portland cement (sanctioned in G.O., No. 3250 W., dated 19th December 1895), petty repairs to the buildings and service pipes and re-metalling the principal roads in the asylum, (sanctioned in G.O., No. 847, Judicial, dated 11th May 1896). The usual annual minor repairs such as, whitewashing, tarring, shifting and replacing tiles, &c, were done to the asylums at Calicut and Vizagapatam. (4) State of repair.The buildings in the Madras Asylum may be said to be in a fair state of repair. The unprecedented heavy rains of November and December of last year caused leakage through the roof in many of the blocks. The kitchen is old and requires renewal, its plan is unsatisfactory and it is too limited for the present cooking requirements of the asylum. The Hospital Assistant's and the attendants' quarters in the Calicut Asylum need repairs. They will be executed in 1897-98 with the annual allotment. In the Vizagapatam Asylum the roof of the hospital and female cottage, female solitary cells, and the roofs of the verandahs of all other cottages require repair. All buildings are in need of plastering. The walls of the solitary cells and sleeping blocks should be cemented to a height of five feet. The kitchen has been condemned and plans for a new one are expected. Nothing has been done to remedy the existing state of things as the retention or abolition of the asylum itself has not yet been decided. (5) Hospital accommodation for males and females.The hospital accommodation for all classes and sexes in the Madras Asylum is very inadequate. The dilficulties which the Superintendent experiences in the care and treatment of the sick owing to this defective accommodation, are indeed very great. I cannot too strongly urge upon Government the extreme urgency of the improvements sanctioned in G.O., No. 3467, W., dated 4th December 1896.' The scheme for the provision of contagious and isolation blocks has been approved by Government and nothing remains but for the work to be put in hand. In the Calicut Asylum the hospital has room for 12 males only. No separate accommodation is available for females who are now located in one of the cells in the female enclosure which accommodates eight sick. The hospital accommodation for both sexes is sufficient in the asylum at Vizagapatam. (c) Sanitation (1) Conservancy.The work in the Madras Asylum was done as well as could be effected with the very limited toty staff available and considering the extremely filthy habits of several of the insanes. The extra reward of one rupee per mensem for good conduct (sanctioned in G.O., No. 874, Judicial, dated 26th April 1895) has certainly had a good effect, but the Superintendent considers that the reduction of the proportion of sweepers to insanes from 1 to 16 to 1 to 20 has been very detrimental in its effects. lie states that the present conservancy arrangements of the asylum are carried on with considerable difficulty, and 1 am strongly of opiuion that the toty staff' should be strengthend.
ANNUAL BEPOIIT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. In the Vizagapatam Asylum, the four day latrines where the dry-earth system is in use, are utilized only during the monsoon. At other seasons, trenches are used and the grounds subsequently cultivated. In the Calicut Asylum the dry-earth system is in use in the detached latrines and the flushing system in the night latrines attached to the cells. The Superintendent has represented to me the necessity for the construction of a latrine to the hospital, and he has been asked to make his proposal the subject of a separate communication. (2) General hygiene of the insanes.This subject has received the careful consideration of the Superintendents of all the asylums ; particular attention having been paid to the bathing, clothing, exercise and food of the insanes. The Superintendent of the Madras Asylum remarks that the general hygienic condition of some of the very filthy insanes could be considerably improved, if the Avails of the rooms in which they are lodged, which are now limewashed and absorbent, be plastered with some glazed material like Portland cement. At present these insanes make the walls and ceilings very filthy and these not admitting of the necessary washing and cleansing, contaminate the atmosphere of the rooms and must tell on the health of the inmates. The subject of cementing the walls of some of the rooms is under consideration. (3) Drainage.Owing to the defective drainage of the Madras Asylum, water stagnated in all the low-lying grounds during the heavy rains of November last and injured the kitchen garden and the asylum produce generally. With reference to G.O., No. 1701, Judicial, dated 28th October 1896, in which I had been asked to report about various points connected with the drainage scheme of the Madras Asylum, I have directed the Superintendent to submit his detailed report on the subject after communicating with the Sanitary Commissioner, the President of the Madras Municipal Commission, and the Consulting Architect. He has replied only about the impossibility of cultivating the Modavakam tank-bed and the use of asylum labour. As 1 am not yet in full possession of information regarding the other questions, my report to Government will be submitted later on. The drainage of the Vizagapatam Asylum is naturally good. V-shaped drains run all round the main buildings of the Calicut Asylum except the refractory ward. (4) Water-supply.The Madras Asylum had an ample supply of water. The Red Hills water was used for all except agricultural purposes. With the new well sunk in the criminal enclosure, a larger area was brought under cultivation. In the Calicut Asylum there was a fair supply of good water except for a few months in the hot weather, when water had to be brought from a tank adjacent to the asylum. In consequence of the complete failure of the north-east monsoon, the water-supply of the Vizagapatam Asylum was very insufficient, the water from the well in the asylum being barely sufficient for drinking and cooking purposes. A cart was sanctioned for bringing water for other purposes from a distance. (5) Food and weiyhment*.Raggi was the staple grain in use in the Madras Asylum, but the Superintendent states that it is greatly disliked by a very large proportion of the inmates, and considers it, on the whole, not so satisfactory as rice, as it can be given only to the stronger and more robust men and women. Cumbu and cholum were the grains in use in the Vizagapatam Asylum and the Superintendent considers them to be very satisfactory after an experience of two years. Extras were very seldom required, and rice was allowed only in the case of a few paying patients. The Superintendent of the Calicut Asylum gave a careful trial of cocoanut oil instead of ghee and reports that he is well pleased with the result. Mangoes, the produce of the asylum, were used pickled instead of the pickled lime formerly in use for the morning conjee. The Superintendent strongly recommends the adoption of a dry grain diet, and I have directed him to give cholum a careful trail, and submit separate weighment statements for such patients as he gave it to.

The weighments are on the whole very satisfactory. It will be seen that out of the total treated in Madras, Vizagapatam and Caliout, the percentages of those who gained weight were, respectively, 50-00, 58'23 and 44-53. The last mentioned at first sight appears somewhat low ; but as the condition of those discharged is the main criterion, it will be observed that the percentage of such of those who gained weight is very high throughout. (6) Clothing.In the Madras Asylum all the inmates were clothed throughout the year, except the acute maniacs who are intolerant of all covering. These cases are very susceptible to chills, and the Superintendent reiterates that the only way to combat diseases and mortality due to exposure to chills is the use of artificially-heated rooms in the hospital. A precis of the whole correspondence on this subject has been sent to him, and he has been directed to submit definite proposals after consultation with the Consulting Architect to Government and the Sanitary Commissioner, who has, for some years, advocated the provision of artificially-heated rooms. Two suits of clothing were supplied to each patient in the asylums at Calicut and Vizagapatam. In Calicut the clothing was of asylum manufacture, and jackets made of unserviceable cumblies were issued to the weakly insanes when necessary (7) Industries and employments.Agricultural industries and weaving were the chief industries in the Madras Asylum. The sale-proceeds of the garden produce amounted to Us. 1,079-15-11 during the year, being Rs. G30-2-0 in.excess of the previous year. This was due to the increased cultivation of vegetables and lucerne grass. 40,182 lbs. of vegetables were grown for asylum use. Weaving has been carried on only to a limited extent during the year, as the sale of manufactured goods was not as large as could be desired, thus leaving a large stock of manufactured goods on hand. The Superintendent was asked to put himself in Communication with likely buyers and offer the goods at reduced rates and report results. The results are already very encouraging. Mat-plaiting and basket, making gave employment for a few for a short period.
8 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. In the Calicut Asylum, cloth and coir mat weaving, coir-twisting and gardening formed the chief industries. Many of the insanes were also employed in drawino-and carrying water, cleaning the asylum compound, tailoring and kitchen work. The females were employed in pounding rice, threshing and twisting coir, grinding currystuff and sweeping the compound. Owing to the contemplated abolition of the asylum, little progress was made in the industries noted. Garden and farm work, cleaning and pounding grains, &c, cloth-weaving, tape making and tin-work continued to be the employments in the Asylum at Vizaga-patam. (8) Amusements.In the Madras Asylum there was a lantern exhibition and a vocal and instrumental concert during the year, besides the usual monthly out-door treats. Cards, draughts, books, writing and drawing have amused the Europeans, while the game of puchees (a native game with cowries) has helped to relieve the monotony of the day among the natives. Rupees 25 a month have been sanctioned (G.O., No. 1701, Judicial, dated 28th October 1896) towards the hiring of conveyances to give the quieter and better behaved insanes an occasional outing to the beach and country. The Superintendent considers lawn-tennis and badminton unsuited to the inmates of an asylum, but considers it very desirable to have a cheap large hall erected, which could be used as a library and reading-room besides serving for the holding of concerts, magic lantern exhibitions, penny readings, &o. The insanes in the Calicut Asylum amused themselves daily between 10 a.m. and 2 p. m. with k kolatam' or chess. Treats were given on cei'tain festival days. The monthly expenditure of Rs. 4 for amusements and Rs. 6 for hiring conveyances for driving the insanes, allowed by Government, will be utilized in future. In the Vizagapatam Asylum the Christmas treat was given by the Superintendent. Singing, playing, tom-tom and cymbals, chess and cards formed the chief amusements. II.-STATISTICS OF HEALTH AND TEEATMENT OF THE SICK. (1) Sickness and Us causes.In the Madras Asylum there were 390 admissions into hospital during the year against 718 in the previous year, and the daily average sick for the year was 57*27 against 89*00 in 1895. The greatly diminished number of admissions during the year was due to the good health which the iusanes generally enjoyed. The largest number of admissions was, in the order of their frequency, for itch, mania, simple continued fever, epilepsy, bronchitis, catarrhal inflammation of the intestines, abscess, tubercle oflung, and general paralysis of the insane. In the Calicut Asylum 141 patients were treated, with a daily average sick of 24*82, against 112 treated in the year previous, with a daily average sick of 22&quot;57. Patients who lost 4 or 5 lb. since the last weighment, and those who steadily lost weight were admitted into hospital. Idiopathic anaemia and disorders of the alimentary tract contributed the largest number of admissions. In the Vizagapatam Asylum the total number treated was 60 against 116 in 1895. The daily average sick was 4*68 against 11*49 in the previous year. The greatest number of admissions was for simple continued fever and disorders of the digestive system. (2) Forcible feeding and methods in use,In the Madras Asylum forcible feeding was resorted to in eight casesin six by the nasal tube, in two per rectum. One Eurasian female insane, who obstinately refused food of any description, was kept alive from January to October by artificial feeding through the nasal tube. She has since then taken to eating of her own accord. Two insanes were forcibly fed in the Calicut Asylumone regularly by the nasal tube and the other by the hand during periods of excitement. Five patients in the Vizagapatam Asylum had more or less continually to be fed by the hand. (3) Mortality and, its causes.38 deaths occurred in the Madras Asylum against 94 (which included 37 cases of cholera) in the previous year. Death was due to the following causes :tubercle of lung 10, mania 6, other mental states 3, bowel complaints 3, abscess 2, epilepsy 2, general paralysis of the insane 2, disease
ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 9 0f the heart 2, disease of the liver 2, asphyxia 1, and cholera 1, gangrene 1, starvation 1, old age 1, and ancylostoma duodenale 1. Cholera occurred in only one case. This patient, who came from Mercara contracted the disease on his way to the asylum. The steps taken on the occurrence of the disease proved sufficient to prevent its spread in the asylum. In the Calicut Asylum 7 deaths occurred against 14 in 1895. Death was due in 3 cases to bowel complaints, in 2 to tubercle, in 1 to general paralysis of the insane, and in 1 to hernia. Only one death occurred in the Vizagapatam Asylum, due to general paralysis of the insane. (4) Epidemics and how they were dealt with.There were no epidemics in any of the asylums. Only one imported case of cholera was treated in the Madras Asylum. All the asylum attendants have been ordered to be re-vaccinated as a preventive against small-pox. (5) htjuries received in the as//fems.-Two cases of serious injuriesboth self-inflictedoccurred in the Madras Asylum, one of which proved fatal. The fatal case was that of a female civil insane, Madura by name, who was confined in a single room owing to an attack of acute mania, and who in the early morning climbed up the iron door and losing her grip fell heavily on to the asphalte floor on the back of her head. On opening the cell she was found in an unconscious condition and died in a few hours without rallying. The usual inquest was held and the post mortem disclosed an extensive fracture of the base of the skull. A full report of the accident was duly submitted to me. The other injury occurred in a Native civil male insane who trespassed into another cell and on being discovered, rushed out knocking his face against the bars and so sustained a simple fracture of the lower jaw; from this he quickly recovered. There were two cases of injuries during the year in the Calicut Asylumone a wound of the ear and the other a contusion of the face. These were caused by the insanes assaulting each other. There occurred only one case of injurysprain of handin the Vizagapatam Asylum, caused by two inmates fighting with each other. (6) Hospital diets and extras.The expenditure on extras, especially on alcoholic stimulants, was very small in the Madras Asylum, considering the daily average sick (57*27). A portable stove was sanctioned by me for the male hospital, it has been found very useful. In the Vizagapatam Asylum the only hospital diet used was * spoon' with extras. In the Calicut Asylum the diets and extras cost Es. 158-13-7 over the previous year. This was due to the larger number of patients treated in the hospital during the year and to the increased doily average sick. The Superintendent reports that a large number of admissions had to be unavoidably placed on extras alone, owing to the nature of their diseases. The hospital diets are those laid down in G.O., No. 1, Public, dated 1st January 1889. (7) Nursing of the sick.In Vizagapatam and Calicut the nursing was done by the keepers and night watchmen under the supervision of the Hospital Assistant. The Superintendent of the Calicut Asylum remarks that this arrangement is very defective and considers it very desirable to have a separate establishment for nursing. I consider it very necessary to have such special attendants who should be trained in sick nursing. As regards the Madras Asylum the nursing establishment consists of 1 matron, 1 head nurse and 2 nurses. One day and one night nurse were more or less in constant attendance on the sick in the male hospital throughout the year. The matron's and the head nurse's duties have been entirely confined to the female section. Regarding the inadequacy of the nursing arrangements in the Madras Asylum, I have already addressed the Government on the subject (No. T * dated 7th February 1897). 3

(ii) Receipts from treasury.The decrease of Rs. 4,969-5-10 under this item was mainly due to the low expenditure under * Diet,' ' Clothing and Bedding' and ' Rates and Taxes.' (iii) Receipts from paying patients.There was a decrease of Rs. 85-15-3 owing to the less number of paying patients having been treated during the year.

(a) The larger accumulation of goods with less prospect of demand for them accounts for the small decrease of Rs. 62-10-9 in the sale-proceeds of the manufactured goods. (b) As has already been stated, the value of clothing made over to the asylums from the manufactory was less by Rs. 1,047-7-10, showing that care was exercised in the issue of new clothing to the inmates. (c) The sale-proceeds of the garden produce contributed an increase of Rs. 959-14-10 due mainly to the increased cultivation of vegetable and lucerne grass in the Lunatic Asylum at Madras, and to the classification of the sale-proceeds of the garden produce of the year under report in the Calicut Asylum under the heading * Value of stores received from the manufacturing department less cost of raw materials.' (d) There was a decrease in the cost of raw materials purchased by Rs. 675-9-0 due, as remarked before, to a larger stock of manufactured goods being in store. (v) Book adjustments.The decrease of Rs. 6,150-8-9 under this item was due to the less amount spent on works executed by the Public Works Depart inent in the Asylum at Madras.
ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLDMS. 11 (vi) Miscellaneous receipts.The decrease of Rs. 508-13-8 under this heading is due to the sale-proceeds of the garden produce of the Lunatic Asylum at Calicut being included in the present year under ' Value of stores received from the manufacturing department less cost of raw materials' instead of under ' Miscellaneous receipts' as shown and to the less sum realized under this heading in the Madras Asylum as per subjoined statement: MadruB.

(i) Edahlisliment.~f\y\\e increase of Rs, 3,452-12-4 is in connection with the Madras and Yizagapatam Asylums and comprises the following items :&#9632; Madras.(a) The increased rate of pay to the Superintendent from Rs. 500 to Rs. G50 from the 28th July 1896 ;
12 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. (b) The inclusion of the pay of the Acting Superintendent Surgeon-Captain Donovan during the absence of the permanent incumbent on privilege leave durino-the year; (c) The increased rate of pay to the junior apothecary ; (d) The addition of the pay of the second assistant steward and that of the nursing staff newly sanctioned ; and (e) The rise in the rate of pay to the matron. Vizagapatam.(a) The enhanced rate of pay to the hospital assistant on account of his promotion to the first class and to the addition of personal allowance of Rs. 10 per mensem granted to him for his good conduct and efficient work under G.O., No. 1271, Public, dated 3rd December 1896. (ii) Diet.The decrease of Rs. 1,655-6-4 under this item occurred on account of the storage of articles of diet at the favourable season in the three asylums and to the change that took place in Calicut in the substitution of oil for ghee, to the more frequent issue of fish instead of mutton and to the discontinuance of salted limes hitherto served with conjee. (iii) Clothing and bedding.The decrease of Rs. 1,354-15-5 was due, as was previously stated, to the care taken both in the use of old clothing and in the issue of new to the inmates. (iv) Medicines.Under this head the rise in expenditure arose from the acquiring of some extra surgical instruments and appliances to complete the hospital equipment in the Madras Asylum and to a larger supply of medicines in Madras and Calicut having been obtained. (v) Contingencies.The decrease under this item by Rs. 1,345-0-3 was caused by a low expenditure on ' Rates and taxes ' and on ' Repairs and maintenance' in the Madras Asylum. (vi) Hospital necessaries.The increase of Rs. 583-10-4 relates to the purchase of a large number of a costlier form (Hobb's) of padlock for general use throughout the Madras Asylum and to an increased expenditure of perishable articles in tbe same asylum; it was also due to the purchase of a galvanized iron bath tub and standard brass measures for grain iu the Vizagapatam Asylum.

(ii) DietMadras.The very high rate of Rs. 65-0-9 per head was due to the (a) inclusion of the cost of European insanes dieting; (b) large average daily sick and consequent increased expenditure on account of hospital diets which are more expensive than the ordinary asylum diets ; (c) inclusion of cost of special diet for paying patients ; (d) clearness in price of articles of supply as compared with the lower rates obtainable at Vizagapatam. Calicut.The cost of dieting is dearer here than at Vizagapatam. This is exemplified by taking one item, viz., the grain used and by comparing the weekly prices prevailing at these localities as published in the season reports from 1st January to 30th June 1896 (26 weeks). From the totals of rice and raggi obtained from these reports, the average cost per week was as follows:&#9632; Vizagapatam Calicut ... Rico seers per rupee. Raggi soers por rupee. 3003 184 122 Supposing both asylums had used rice alone, the cost of dieting at this asylum should have been at least one-half dearer than at VizagapatamRs. 25 spent at Vizagapatam would represent Rs. 37-8-0 at Calicut. But as dry grains were used in the former during the year on all days except Wednesdays and Sundays, t.e., for 130 days out of 182 days from January to June 1896, the cost of dieting at Calicut would be nearly two-and-a-half times (2*48) dearer than at the other place, or, if at Vizagapatam the cost of dieting was Its. 25, it would be at Calicut Its. 62-8-0, whereas it was only Rs. 55-12-8. Similar comparison might be made in respect to other items of diets. The Superintendenti however, promises that he would endeavour to minimise the expenditure under this item by occasionally trying dry grains instead of rice as heretofore. (iii) Clothing and bedding.Tho charges under this heading show a decreaso in the Madras and Calicut Asylums for reasons explained elsewhere, and the slight increase in the Vizagapatam Asylum calls for no special remark. 4
14 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS&quot;. (iv) Medicines.The increase under this heading in the Madras and Calicut Asylums is due, as explained before, to the procurence of some extra surgical instruments and appliances in the former, and to the obtaining of a larger supply of medicines in the two asylums. (v) Contingencies, Madras.The decrease is due to a smaller expenditure on Rates and taxes' and on s Repairs and maintenance' as previously remarked. In this connection it may be said that the amount of savings under this head would be still greater but for the large expenditure incurred as railway charges caused by a release of a number of criminal insanes who had to be sent to their homes at long distances accompanied by native attendants, and the discharge of a large number of recovered civil insanes who in many cases swelled the travelling expenses from their having to go long journeys. Vizagapatam.The increase under this heading was due to expenditure for the first time on amusements, viz., Rs. 21-14-0 and to the cost of petty repairs viz., Rs. 21-12-6 against Rs. 2-8-0 for 1895. Calicut.A very slight increase under this item by Rs. 33-9-9 was due to a larger sum being spent on ' Repairs and maintenance' which were very urgent during the year. (vi) Hospital necessaries and miscellanies.The increase under this item in the Madras and Vizagapatam Asylums was due to the causes noted above. The slight decrease in the Calicut Asylum under this heading calls for no special comment. ii- Paying PatientsMadras.The total number of paying patients was only 53 against 84 in the previous year. The total amount realized was Rs. 9,962-0-6 against Rs. 9,984-13-7 in 1895a result that may be considered very satisfactory when it is remembered that there was a fall in the number by 31. This is entirely dependent on the introduction of the new rates of hospital stoppages laid down in G.O., No. 434, Public, dated 31st March 1896. Vizagajpatam.There were five paying patients at the commencement of the year, one was admitted and two discharged leaving four at the close of the year. The receipts from them increased from Rs. 311-15-6 in 1895 to Rs. 338-12-1 during the year under report. A large increase at this asylum is expected during the current year as under CO., No. 163, Public, dated 18th February 1897, Government has informed the Residents of Hydrabad and Travancore that the Native States would be held liable to pay all expenses of civil insanes belonging to them who are maintained in the asylums of this Presidency. The outstandings on account of this class of men still maintained in this asylum are about Rs. 500. Calicut.There were three paying patients with a daily average of 2*16. The sum realized was Rs. 251-0-11 against Rs. 335-15-8. The decrease is not real, for a sum of Rs. 80 and odd due in 1896 was paid only in January 1897, the payer electing to come all the way from Wynaad to pay the sum due and thereby delaying payment in time. iii.

The best result was that obtained at Vizagapatam, which is very creditable; next to that was Madras. In Calicut the total earnings were only Rs. 582-1-0 against Rs. 1,145-3-5 at Vizagapatam with an average number of 34*36 in the. former against 25*82 in the latter employed on remunerative labour. The reasons for the decrease in Calicut may be summarised as follows : (1) Supply of bedding and clothing to nearly all the hospitals in the district during the previous year having been made, the demand for the same was less during 1896 from these institutions ; (2) No other manufactures were introduced during the year as it was under contemplation to close the asylum ; (3) Some of the best workmen were discharged from the asylum * cured' or * relieved' and fresh mon had to be taught; and (4) Gardening could not bo sufficiently attended to as the wells ran dry in March and continued so till the middle of Juno. The Superintendent reports that the soil there is very bad aud he is endeavouring to improve it by manure obtained from the asylum and cattlo sheda in the town.
16 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. In Madras only a very small number was put on remunerative labour, and the Superintendent ascribes this to the remunerative industries being confined to weaving and the growing of vegetables and lucerne grass only. iv.

The rains towards the end of the year inflicted great damage in the farm and the garden. The cause of the decrease in Vizagapatam was due to the short rainfall in the earlier months and the complete failure of the north-east monsoon ; in consequence of this no second crop could be raised, and gardening for the last two months of the year was almost stopped. The increase in the Calicut Asylum is slight and calls for no special remark. IV.GENEEAL. (1) General AdministrationMadras Asylum.The Superintendent again dwells at length on the impossibility of any (Superintendent doing the professional portion of his work satisfactorily as long as he has constantly to attend to the supervision of the steward's department and to the large amount of scriptory work which is increasing year by year. He points out that the difficulties will be considerably increased when he has to deliver lectures on mental diseases and impart clinical instruction to students. The only solution of the difficulty will be, he says, to appoint an additional Commissioned Medical officer or a competent, properly-paid European to assist the Superintendent in the non-professional portions of his duties. He regrets that, as it is, he cannot rely on any of his subordinates, except the Assistant Surgeon and the Junior Apothecary, and he attributes the indifferent work done to the deficient salaries sanctioned by Government, which are too low to be attractive to desirable men. It is very gratifying to note that in the Madras Asylum the expenditure has considerably decreased. The recoveries from paying patients have increased compared with the number of patients. The number of cures of insanes was maintained at a high figure, the average daily sick has fallen, indicating a general improved healthy condition of the inmates, and the mortality has been reduced. Surgeon-Captain Palk may be congratulated on the admirable work done, and I trust that early effect would be given to the orders of Government about the question of increasing the Superintendent's pay (G.O., No. 1217, Judicial, dated 23rd July 18UG). The native attendants were exempted from paying rent for the huts occupied by them in the lines under G.O., No. 533, Judicial, dated 13th March 1896. The general admiuistration of the other two asylums was also satisfactory. (2) Establishment (a) GeneralMadras Asylum.'The Superintendent again speaks in eulogistic terms of Military Assistant Surgeon Judge, who held the post of Deputy Superintendent during the year, and considers that officer's salary to be inadequate for his position, work and ability when compared to other men of his standing who are allowed to take private practice. Ho remarks that the European attendants havo worked fairly well on the whole; but the main drawback with those men seems to be their very poor educational attainments, they being unable even to maintain their stock-book and to write correct reports. The service of one of tlio First-class European attendants was dispensed with during the year, he having been convicted of theft of Government
ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 17 property. There were many changes in these attendants during the year involving a deal of trouble in training the new men. The matron Mrs. Fellowes has performed her duties fairly well. The Superintendent does not speak favourably of steward Anna Chetty, who, with his twenty-five years' experience in the asylum, is reported to have caused much trouble. He is said to be against every improvement in the steward's departmentslow, untidy, irritable and rude. He has been often reprimanded, but seems to have done his duties fairly well. Store-keeper Moothia Pillai, who filled the post up to November, was found guilty of theft and sentenced to six months' rigorous imprisonment by the Chief Presidency Magistrate. When his connection with the appointment ceased, a thorough stock-taking took place, several irregularities were discovered; none, however, being of a serious nature, most of the non-perishable articles being found in excess. Native attendants.The Superintendent reports that these men have constantly given trouble. To get a better class of men the Superintendent suggests that the pay of these men, who are constituted under three grades, should be increased from ]{s. 12, 10 and 8 to Rs. 15, 12 and 9, respectively. In this opinion I fully concur with the Superintendent. The-Superintendent again suggests also that these attendants should be supplied with free uniform by Government, this being essential for the discipline and well-being of the asylum. The ayahs are reported to have worked indifferently. To ensure the services of good, honest women for these places, the Superintendent proposes more liberal pay and free uniform. The eoohs seem to have worked indifferently well. One of them was dismissed on account of theft. The toties seem to be more satisfied since their pay was augmented by a rupee a month, but the Superintendent considers the number too small. Calicut Asylum First-class Hospital Assistant D. Rajaratnam, No. 90, was in subordinate charge until 3rd September, on which date he died from disease of the heart. The Superintendent remarks that this Hospital Assistant was doing his work satisfactorily, and that his sudden death was a great loss to the asylum. From 3rd September to 10th October the asylum was looked after by Hospital Assistants ordered to do temporary duty. First-class Hospital Assistant Muhammad Ibrahim, No. 307, for whose services the Superintendent had specially applied, assumed charge on the 10th October, and the Superintendent hopes to show better results than previously with his help. There was no other change in the establishment of the Calicut Asylum. Clerk H. Taveira and Store-keeper P. Kunhi Ohandu are reported to have done their work to the entire satisfaction of the Superintendent. The keepers in general are also said to have done their work fairly well. Vizagapatam Asylum.Hospital Assistant Anantayya, No. 326, was promoted to the First class from 1st July. The Superintendent is glad to be again able to express his appreciation of the Hospital Assistant's steady work and interest in everything connected with the asylum. In accordance with CO., No. 1271, Public, &lt;lated 3rd December 1896, he now draws Rs. 10 per mensem as a personal allowance in consideration of the work done during the past 4J years, during which time he was not absent even for a day. He is assisted in the management of the stores PJid in the office work by the store-keeper. This latter official was known until November 1892 as head-keeper, in which capacity he drew Rs. 25 per mensem. From that time he has been store-keeper on Rs. 20 per mensem. His conduct is reported to have been satisfactory. The male and female attendants are said to have done their work indifferently with few exceptions. One temporary male attendant was employed during the year owing to increase of strength. The tcties are reported to give trouble continuously* (b) Hospital.In the Madras Asylum Mr. Noronha was Junior Apothecary lor the first six months and Mr. Jones for the second half of the year. Both have done their work with care and diligence and to the Superintendent's complete Batisfaction. Second-class Hospital Assistant Doraisamy Pillai was working in 5
18 ANNUAL ItEPOttT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. the asylum throughout the year, and has been reported by the Superintendent to be ignorant, careless and unfit to look after the patients of an asylum. He has been transferred. Nursing staffvide supra II (7) There are no special hospital establishments in the Calicut and Vizagapatam Asylums. (3) Notes On Visitors' Reports.The Madras Asylum was visited during the year once by the Honourable bir J. Woodburn, once by the Sanitary Commissioner, once by the Inspector-General of Prisons, and on several occasions by me. As the Sanitary Commissioner has made several proposals of an important nature, they will be treated here in detail. (i) Considering the defective nature of the buildings and the nature and number of the attendant staff he proposed to lock the violent suicidal patients in bare cells in a naked condition. About this proposal the Superintendent remarks that it is absolutely necessary that the walls and floors of these cells should be made of non-absorbent material and that the cells should be capable of being warmed to an equable temperature during the cold months. The superintendent, however, considers the number of the attendant staff to be sufficient but the quality defective. The question of artificially maintaining the heat of these rooms has been dwelt upon previouslyvide I (c), 6. (ii) A filtered water-supply for the asylum.The estimate for this was not sanctioned by Government, as the Government did not consider that the necessity to erect the proposed filter beds had been sufficiently demonstrated (G.O., No. 1701, Judicial, dated 28th October 1896). (iii) Flashing the various blocks under pressure from hydrant.Government has disallowed the estimates for the flushing scheme on my reporting to Government that the Madras Municipality had lately increased its free issue of Red Hills water to the asylum to 600,000 gallons a month (G.O., No. 1701, Judicial, dated 28th December 1896). (iv) The abolition of the Modavakam tank.The breaching of this tank and cultivating its bed are under consideration and as already stated, I have asked the Superintendent to submit his report after consultation with the Municipal President and the Sanitary Commissioner. His report is awaited. (v) TJie advisability of the open bathing cisterns.The Sanitary Commissioner considered these objectionable, as he opined that they were liable to be contaminated. The Superintendent, however, does not fully concur with the Sanitary Commissioner in the opinion, but thinks that elevated wrought-iron cisterns would be decidedly preferable. During a recent visit of His Excellency the Governor of Madras to the asylum, His Excellency was pleased to endorse the opinion of the Sanitary Commissioner about the necessity of a trained staff of attendants for the hospital and to draw attention to the Sanitary Commissioner's report about the drainage and flushing scheme. Calicut Asylum.There were six meetings of the official visitors. During the year the Superintendent of Police, the Subordinate Judge, the Principal District Munsif, and the Treasury Deputy Collector were appointed extra oflicial visitors of the asylum. Regular monthly meetings are now held in accordance with the desire expressed by His Excellency the Governor when he visited the asylum on the 30th September. The asylum was also visited during the year by myself, by the Inspector-General of Prisons, and by the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner. The Vizagapatam Asylum was visited during the year once by me and once by the Inspector-General of Prisons. The official visitors met once every month. With reference to paragraph 2 of G.O., No. 983, Judicial, dated 8th June 1896, reviewing the annual report of Lunatic Asylums for 1895, the Superintendent of the Vizagapatam Asylum states that so far from admissions into asylums being too freely ordered, there are lunatics in every town who are a nuisance to the public
ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 19 and should not be allowed at large. He supports his statement by a number ot serious cases within his own knowledge. There is not the least doubt that many of these insanes have better chances of recovery, if brought early enough under skilled treatment. In the Government order reviewing the annual report on Lunatic Asylums for 1880-81, District officers have been directed, when opportunity offered, &quot; to impress on the people the advantage of early removal of insanes to an asylum.&quot; Again in G.O., No. 1324, Judicial, dated 17th May 1853, it was pointed out that lunatics who should have been placed under treatment frequently became criminals by being allowed at large. Paragraph 2 of the above Government order runs as follows.&quot; The Governor in Council observes that this lunatic showed signs of madness for a couple of months previous to the committal of the offence, yet no notice appears to have been taken of him either by the village or police authorities, and this, in spite of repeated orders, on the subject. The Governor in Council is again constrained to call the attention of all Magistrates and Police officers to the provisions of Act XXXVI of 1858 and to the obligations that rest upon them therefrom, of the importance of which there still appears to be an inadequte conception.&quot; But while bringing to the notice of Government the fact that a number of insanes who ought to be admitted into asylums are allowed to roam at large, I do not lose sight of the possibility of a number of harmless insanes being admitted into asylums and I have directed the Superintendents of the three asylums to put themselves in communication with Magistrates and inform me as to the number of harmless insanes who may bs handed over to their friends, &c, in accordance with the desire expressed by Government in its order No. 983, Judicial, dated 8th June 1896. (4) Inventory.The inventory of the valuable stock of the three asylums has been duly checked and maintained. (5) Verification of service books.The service books of all the servants of the three asylums have been verified up to the period under report. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, C. SIBTHORPE, Surgeon-Major-General, Surgeon-General with the Government of Madras,

The cost per head in the Vizagapatam asylum was again the lowest on record in spite of the increased establishment charges which occurred during the year. The rise in the cost per head in the Madras establishment arises almost entirely under " Estab- lishment " ; the Government is glad to note that slight reductions have been effected under diet and clothing. There was a satisfactory reduction, as compared with 1895 in the cost per head of patients in the Calicut asylum, economies having been effected mainly under clothing and bedding. The serious attention of the Surgeon-General was last year called to the high expenditure upon diets in the Madras and Calicut asylums. The Surgeon-General attributes the high rate in Madras to the cost of dieting Europeans and to the high local prices of the articles consumed, and shows that the diet of paying patients, which is included in the totals, raises apparentlyANNUAL REPORT ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN THE MADRAS PRESIDENCY FOR THE YEAR 1897.

To Sir, I have the honour to submit to His Excellency the Governor in Council the annual report on the working of the Lunatic Asylums in the Presidency for the year 1897. 2. The report has been prepared according to the directions contained in G.O., No. 983, Judicial, dated 8th June 1896, and No. 619, Public, dated 22nd May 1897. I.POPULATION AND ACCOMMODATION.

He will be directed, in future, to carry out the classification as ordered years ago, and at least include those whose dirty habits require them to be isolated. (4) Results of treatment.Of the 103 patients discharged, 61 were cured and 42 were discharged otherwise; of the latter, 24 were handed over to their friends (18 in improved condition), 11 were transferred to England, 6 were put on the civil list of patients, and 1 escaped from the Madras Asylum, but was brought back after the opening of the current year. In all three asylums, the treatment consisted of careful attention to general hygiene, systematic occupation, and regular recreation. Of drugs, bromides and the hyoscyamus principles afforded much relief. No case of clinical interest has been reported during the year. (5) Escapes.Two patients escaped from the Madras and 2 from the Calicut Asylum, all the 4 were recaptured, the last 1 after the beginning of 1898. The warders concerned were severely punished.

ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATTC ASYLUMS. (12) Criminal population and their sub-divisions.No criminal lunatics are received into the Vizagapatam and Calicut Asylums. In the Madras Asylum there remained from the previous year 126 males and 1 7 females ; and 28 males and 2 females were admitted in 1897, making a total of 173. The deaths numbered 1 more than in 18y6, while admissions numbered 2 less. Of the admissions, 2 were tried and acquitted prisoners, 18 were under-trial prisoners incapable of making a defence, and 10 were cases that became insane during confinement in jail. (b) Accommodation (1) Sufficiency.Tbere was no overcrowding in any of the asylums. In the Madras Asylum, with available accommodation for 689 lunatics, the maximum number of inmates on any one day was 432; while the maximum numbers at Vizagapatam and Calicut, with accommodation, respectively, for 91 and 135 lunatics, were 75 and 101. In calculating the above accommodation available for general insanes, the following accommodation is reserved for the sick in hospital: Madras Vizagapatam .. Calicut Males. 32 13 12 Females. 14 No admissions have occurred in the ' special wards ' during the past year. (2) New constructions.These embraced(a) in Madras the new well in the criminal enclosure was completed, and a large cistern iu connexion with it; a teak ceiling to one of the rooms in the Superintendent's quarters; and the construction of a masonry culvert; (b) in Vizagapatam a cook-room on the standard plan for jails was commenced in March lo97, and is still under construction; and (c) in Calicut the office building, which was in very unsafe condition, was dismantled. (3) Repairs executed.In Madras an oven was rebuilt in the kitchen and petty repairs to the blocks and service pipes were executed. In Vizagapatam the hospital was re-roofed, and the old bath and store rooms attached thereto were converted into single rooms; the re-roofing of the female ward was in progress. The walls to a height of 5 feet have been cemented. The usual annual minor repairs, such as lime-washing, tarring, shifting and replacing tiles, &c, were carried out in Calicut, as well as in the other asylums. (4) State of repair.The buildings in the Madras Asylum are in fair state of repair ; some portions of the walls of different blocks require re-plastering on their exterior. In Vizagapatam the walls of the male sleeping wards and of the single rooms require cementing on their inside and plastering outside. In Calicut the buildings are not at all satisfactory and need thorough repair. The alterations and improvements sanctioned by Government for the Madras Asylum have been held in abeyance for want of fundsvide G.O., No. 3467 W., Public Works, dated 4th December 1896. (5) Hospital accommodation for males and females.The hospital accommodation in the Madras Asylum is very inadequate. The improvements, sanctioned in C.O., No. 3467 W., dated 4th December 1896, are urgently required. In Vizagapatam accommodation exists for 13 males ; the single rooms in the female enclosure are used for female patients as necessary. In Calicut there is accommodation for 12 males; female patients are treated in a cell in the female enclosure. (c) Sanitation (1) Conservancy,In Madras the work was done as well as could be effected with the limited toty staff available. The Superintendent maintains that the proportion of sweepers to insanes (now 1 to 20) should be raised, and I am of the same opinion. He also suggests that the good-conduct pay (sanctioned in G.O., No. 874, Judicial, dated 26th April 1895), should be merged into an increased monthly salary; and that early effect be given to the Government order sanctioning huts for the sweepers (CO., No. 1701, Judicial, dated ?8th October 1896). 2
6 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. In Vizagapatam the ' dry-earth' system is carried out, the night-soil beino* converted into poudrette in the dry season and buried in trenches in the rains. In Calicut dry earth is used in the detached latrines, and the flushing system adopted for the night latrines attached to the cells ; the night-soil is utilized as at Vizagapatam. The construction of a latrine for the hospital in the Calicut Asylum has been postponed, though much needed. (2) General hygiene of the insanes.The Superintendents of all three asylums have paid particular attention to the bathing, clothing, exercise and food of the insanes. The Superintendent of the Madras Asylum again lays stress on the need for cementing the walls of some of the rooms. (3) Drainage.The subject of improving the drainage of the Madras Asylum is in the hands of the Consulting Architect. The drainage of the Vizagapatam Asylum is naturally good. In Calicut V-shaped drains run all round the main buildings except the refractory ward ; and here the work was sanctioned but was postponed by Governmentvide G- 0., No. 1311, Public, dated 2nd October 1897. (-1) Water-supply.The Madras Asylum had an ample supply of water. The Red Hills water was used for all except agricultural purposes. Owing to the failure of the north-east monsoon in 1896 the Vizagapatam Asylum well failed; temporary wells were dug in the bed of a tank, at a distance of - mile, and all water for the first eight months of the year was carted and carried by the insanes. At Calicut there was, as usual, a fair supply of good water from June to December ; but from January till the rains set in many of the wells dried up, and water for flushing and gardening purposes had to be brought from a tank some distance from the asylum. (d) Miscellaneous (1) Food and weighments.Kagi was the staple grain in use in the Madras Asylum, but the Superintendent considers it not so satisfactory as rice, on the ground that the insanes have a tendency to bolt their food in spite of every care, and that ragi diet so bolted is not easily digested. Cumboo and cholam are the grains in use in the Vizagapatam Asylum, and the Superintendent considers them to be very satisfactory. Rice is the staple food grain in Calicut. Twenty patients were fed with cholam instead of rice with the following: result: Number weighed Do. gained ...

(2) Clothing.In the Madras Asylum all the inmates were clothed throughout the year, except the acute maniacs who are intolerant of all covering. The clothing was of cotton supplemented by flannel banians and woollen jerseys for the sick and weakly. Two suits of clothing were supplied to each patient in the asylums at Calicut and Yizagapatam. (8) Industries and employments.Agricultural industries and weaving are the chief industries in the Madras Asylum. The sale-proceeds of the garden produce amounted to Rs. 1,750-10-11, being Rs. 229-5-0 less than the amount of income in the previous year on account of the failure of the rains ; but the sale of manufactured goods advanced from Es. 1,021-7-1 in 1896 to Rs. 2,189-1-8 in 1897. Mat-plaiting and basket-making gave employment to a few for a short period. Garden and farm work, cleaning and pounding grains, &c, cloth-weaving, tape-making, and tin-work continued to be the employments in the Vizagapatam Asylum. In the Calicut Asylum, cloth and coir-mat-weaving, coir-twisting and gardening formed the chief industries. Many of the insanes were also employed in drawing and carrying water, cleaning the asylum compound, tailoring and kitchen work. The females were employed in pounding rice, threshing and twisting coir, grinding curry-stuff, and sweeping the compound. (4) Amusements.In the Madras Asylum these were very varied and embraced the following: (a) Open air entertainments with band musio and refreshments; (b) visit to a circus performance; (c) marionette entortainment; (d) magic lantern entertainments with songs and music ; (e) out-door games including quoits and football, and iu-door games of draughts and cards and othor games for natives. Periodicals have been regularly supplied by Government; and the gharri allowance has been drawn upon on the ocoasions of insanes going to entertainments outside the asylum. At the Vizagapatam Asylum the annual treat was given in April by Sri Rajah G. N. Gajapati Rao, c.i.b. Singing, playing, tom-tom and cymbals, chess and cards formed the chief amusements. In Calicut His Highness the Zamorin gave the inmates a treat on the day of the Diamond Jubilee. For daily amusements the insanes were permitted to play from 10 a.m. till 2 p.m. with kolatam or chess. II.STATISTICS OF HEALTH AND TREATMENT OP THE SICK. (1) Sickness and its causes.In the Madras Asylum there were 361 admissions into hospital during the year against 399 in the previous year ; and the daily average sick for the year was 48'07 against 57*27 in 1896. The largest number of admissions in order of frequency was for mania, itch, epilepsy, enteritis, melancholia, malarial fevers, and syphilis.
8 ANNUAL EEPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. In the Vizagapatam Asylum there were 50 admissions, 20 of whom were cases of simple continued fever and probably due to chills. The daily average sick was 3*11 against 4*63 in the previous year. In the Calicut Asylum there were 159 admissions with a daily avernge sick of 26*36 as compared with 141 admissions, and a daily average sick of 24'82 in the previous year; dysentery, intermittent fever, and anaemia contributed the largest number of admissions. (2) Forcible feeding and methods in use.In the Madras Asylum 27 cases required forcible feeding by the naso-pharyngeal tube, and 1 case was fed per rectum. In Vizagapatam, 5 patients were fed by hand and 1 by nasal tube. In Calicut, 6 insanes had to be fed forcibly by the hand, and 3 others were fed by naso-pharyngeal tube during all their periods of excitement. (3) Mortality and its causes.37 deaths occurred in the Madras Asylum against 38 in the previous year. Death was due to the following causes :Mania and other mental states 13, general paralysis of the insane 8, epilepsy 2, tubercle 2, cancer 2, starvation 2, chronic interstitial inflammation of the lungs 2, enteritis 2, and one each of dysentery, secondary syphilis, anchylostomosis, anaemia, paraplegia, pneumonia, catarrhal inflammation of the stomach, ulceration of the intestine and injury to the chest. Only one death occurred in the Vizagapatam Asylum, due to &quot; exhaustion of mania.&quot; In the Calicut Asylum 21 deaths occurred against 7 in 1896. The causes of death werecholera 8. idiopathic anaemia 4, dysentery 3, and one each of rheumatism, valvular disease of the heart, gangrene of the lung, chronic phthisis, catarrhal inflammation of the intestines and Bright's disease. (4) Epidemics and how they were dealt with.No epidemics occurred in the Madras or Vizagapatam Asylums. In Calicut some cases of cholera occurred in July during the epidemic in the neighbourhood. The patients were segregated, and a separate extra establishment was appointed. The wells were re-Hankenized and all water for drinking purposes was boiled before use. Phenyl was freely used. Evacuations were carefully collected in a vessel containing saw-dust and burnt with kerosine-oil. Old cumblies and clothing were burnt, and good ones were boiled in a solution of perchloride of mercury. The inmates were given water acidulated with sulphuric acid, and a diminished quantity of salt for food. After the epidemic was over, the wails and floors were scraped, cleaned, disinfected and whitewashed : (5) Injuries received in the asylums.Tn Madras Asylum there was one case of serious injury during the year. A native female criminal died within a few hours of her admission on the 17th April 1897, as the result of extensive abdominal injury, but how it was brought about, the magisterial enquiry that followed failed to elicit. As a departmental punishment, the head nurse was reduced to second-grade nurse, and an ayah was dismissed. Two cases of fracture of the forearm occurred in Calicut Asylum ; in both cases the injuries took place in a fall while fighting, and before the keepers could separate the combatants. A scalp wound (not serious) was the only injury reported from Vizagapatam Asylum. (6) Hospital diet and extras.The hospital diets are those laid down in CO., Wo. 1, Public, dated 1st January 1889. The scale was found both ample and well suited to the requirements of the sick. In the Madras Asylum the hospital extras being included with the extras of the non-hospital diets, the Superintendent could not furnish the amount spent on hospital diets with extras for the year 1897. He has been directed to take steps to correct this in future. In Vizagapatam the total cost amounted to Rs. 41-0-10, and the daily average sick to 3*11. In Calicut the cost of hospital diet and extras, including the dieting of paying patients, amounted to Rs. 1,950-14-7, and the average daily sick was 26*36. (7) Nursing of the sick.In Vizagapatam and Calicut the nursing was done by the keepers and night watchmen under the supervision of the Hospital Assistant,
ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 9 The Superintendent of the Calicut Asylum remarks that this arrangement is very defective, and considers it desirable to have a separate establishment for nursing. I consider it very necessary to have such special attendants who should be trained in sick-nursing. In the Madras Asylum the nursing establishment consists of one matron and three nurses. One day and one night nurse were more or less in constant attendance on the sick in the male hospital throughout the year. The matron's and the head nurse's duties have been entirely confined to the female section. Regarding the inadequacy of the nursing arrangements in the Madras Asylum, I addressed the Government, Nos. T. TV and f, dated 7th February and 9th May 1897, respectively; the Government considered that the existing scale of nursing establishment must, for the present, suffice (G.O., No. 674, Public, dated 28th May 1897). III.FINANCE INCLUDING MANUFACTURES. I. General.The total receipts during the year amounted to Rs. 1,06,959-4-5 against Rs. 1,12,044-7-11 in 1896, and were from the following sources:&#9632; Sources. 1896. 1897. Increase. Decrease. 1.

do ANNUAL BEPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. (v) Booh adjustments.The decrease of Rs. 4,168-9-4 under this item is due to the less amount spent on works executed by the Public Works Department in the asylum at Madras. (vi) Miscellaneous receipts.The increase of Rs. 52-0-6 under this heading is due to better sale-proceeds of condemned stores, and to large recoveries in fines from the contractor of the Madras Asylum.

(ii) Diet.The increase under this item in Vizagapatam Asylum was due to high prices owing to the famine. (iii) Clothing and bedding.The expenditure in Calicut Asylum was increased by Us. 40-13-4, owing to the purchase of new cumblies after the epidemic of cholera. (iv) Medicines.The cost of medicines was considerably reduced on the whole. The slight increase in Vizagapatam arose from extra outlay for stock appliances. (v) Contingencies.Expenditure under this bead was increased in Madras and Calicut Asylums, where petty repairs to buildings were extensively carried out during the year. (vi) Hospital necessaries and miscellanies.The cost of this item was reduced in all three asylums. IT. Paying PatientsMadras.The total number of paying patients was 69 ag ainst 53 in the previous year. The total amount realized was Rs. 10,638-14-11, an increase of Rs. 676-13-7 over the collections of 1896. Vhagapatam.Nine patients were treated in all, and the stoppagos recovered for them amounted to Rs. 647-0^7, against Rs. 338-32-1 in the previous year. A patient in this asylum who had, for many years, been classed as a pauper, was recognised by a native gentleman visiting the asylum as a man who formerly owned land in the Kistna district. Enquiries elicited the fact that he still has property; and the Collector of the Kistna district has undertaken to pay the cost of his maintenance annually during the period of his stay in the institution.
12 ANN DAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. CalicutThere were 3 paying patients with a daily average strength of 1/76 as contrasted with 2*16 in the previous year. The total receipts on their account amounted to Rs. 213-4-11, or less by Ks. 37-12-0 than the recoveries in 1896, the fall being due to the decrease in the average number. HI.

(1) General Administration.The second edition of the Code containing the laws relating to lunatics and the rules regarding the management and superintendence of Lunatic Asylums was published in July 1897 having been approved bv Government in G.O., No. 163S, Judicial, dated 13th October 1896. The work of revision devolved originally on Surgeon-Major Evans, who was acting as Superintendent of the Lunatic Asylum at Madras in the year 1894, and subsequently on the present Superintendent Surgeon-Captain 0. H. LeetPalk; both of these officers were assisted by first-class Military Assistant Surgeon H. H. M. Judge, Deputy Superintendent of the Asylum. Madras Asylum.The Superintendent again dwells at length on the difficulties he has to contend with in working this large and important asylum. The general administration of the other two asylums was satisfactory. (2) Establishment (a) GeneralMadras Asylum.The Superintendent again speaks in eulogistic terras of Military Assistant Surgeon Judge, who held the post of Deputy Superintendent during the year, and considers that officer's salary to be inadequate to his position, work and ability, when compared to other men of his standing who are allowed to take private practice. The European attendants are reported to have worked fairly well, their general lack of education and intelligence being atoned for by their good general behaviour. The matron Mrs. Fellowes has worked to the best of her ability. Mrs. Kaye was the head nurse up to April last, but was reduced for general want of intelligence. Mrs. Cleary took charge of the appointment, and has worked well to the satisfaction of the Superintendent. The steward K. Annu Chetty has given less trouble than he did in the previous year. He continues to be, as last reported on, slow, untidy, irritable and rude. Store-keeper Gopalsamy &#9632;Aiyar and Second assistant steward llajagopaul Mudali have worked well throughout the year. First assistant steward Mr. McKenzie was promoted to head steward of the Government Maternity Hospital in November 1897; no pormanent incumbent to succeed him had been decided upon at the time of making the annual report. Native attendants.The Superintendent again urges the desirability of reorganising the staff of native attendants in three grades to be paid Rs. 15, 12 and 9, respectively, and to be supplied with free uniform by Government. He makes similar suggestions with regard to the ayahs. Of toties the Superintendent maintains that a proportion of 1 to every 16 insanes should be sanctioned instead of 1 to every 20 as at present. The Superintendent has been called upon to submit a separate communication on these subjects dealing fully with the questions involved. Vizagapatam Asylum.First-class Hospital Assistant Y. Anantayyn, No. 326, was in charge throughout the year. The Superintendent is glad to bo again able to express his appreciation of the Hospital Assistant's steady work and interest in everything connected with the asylum. In accordance with G.O., No. 1271, Public, dated 3rd December 1896, he draws Its. 10 per mensem as a personal alldwanco in consideration of the work done during tho past five-and-a-half years during which time ho was not absent eveu for a day. Store-keeper A. Jagganath Uao has done
1-4 ANNUAL EEPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. his work satisfactorily. The male and female attendants have worked indifferently well, but the toties are a constant source of trouble. Calicut Asylum.First-class Hospital Assistant Mahomed Ibrahim, No. 307, was in subordinate charge of the asylum up to the 8th May 1897, and was succeeded by first-class Hospital Assistant CD. Sigamoney Pillai, No. 136, who in turn was relieved on the afternoon of the 27th November by second-class Hospital Assistant A. Gopalan, No. 422. The last-named, being a West Coast man, appears to he more in touch with the inmates of the asylum than his predecessors ; the Superintendent speaks in flattering terms of the subordinate, and hopes his next report will substantiate his good opinion. (b) Hospital.In the Madras Asylum, Civil Apothecary E. T. Jones was dismissed the service on the 5th July 1897 for gross irregularities. He was succeeded by Civil Apothecary B. D'Prazer, who continued in sub-charge until 15th September, on which date he was relieved by Civil Apothecary W. J. Cooper. Mr. D'Prazer did his work carefully, and seemed to take great pains and interest in dealing with the sick. Mr. Cooper performed his duties fairly well. Second-class Hospital Assistant Ramunni Menon, No. 394, worked throughout the year. He has improved considerably, and has performed his duties satisfactorily. There are no special hospital establishments in the Vizagapatam and Calicut Asylums. The serious want of a trained staff of male and female hospital attendants distinct from the general staff is a matter for urgent action, as soon as the present financial difficulties are past. (3) Notes on Visitors' Reports.The Madras Asylum was visited during the year once by His Excellency the Governor, once by the Inspector-General of Prisons, and once by me. The Yizagayatam Asylum was visited once by me, and once by the Inspector-General of Prisons ; and the Calicut Asylum was visited once by me, once by the District Collector and Magistrate, and once by the Inspector-General of Prisons. In addition, the asylums were visited by official visitorsmonthly at Madras and Viza^apatam, and seven times during the year at Calicut. The general tone of the reports has been satisfactory. (4) Inventory.The inventory of the valuable stock of the three asylums has been duly checked and maintained. (5) Verification of Service Books.The service books'of all the servants of the three asylums have been verified up to the period under report. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, C. SIBTHORPE, c.b., f.e.c.p.t., Surgn.-Major-Genl., Surgeon-General with the Government of Madras.

No. 699, Public, 25th May 1898. GOVERNMENT OF MADRAS. PUBLIC DEPARTMENT. Readthe following paper: From the Surgeon-General, No. T.-18, dated 16th April 1898. Abstract.Submitting report on the working of Lunatic Asylums in the Presidency for the year 1897. OrderNo. 699, Public, dated 25th May 1898. The report on the working of the Lunatic Asylums in the Presidency for the year 1897 was submitted punctually. 2. Population and Accommodation, The following table compares the statistics of the population of the asylums for the last two years: Population at beginning of year. Admissions. Discharged. Died.

The 158 admissions included 128 of the former, and 30 of the latter, class. The Surgeon-General's report as to the possibility of handing over to the care of their friends or relatives the harmless civil lunatics in the three asylums was recorded in G.O., No. 989, Public, dated 23rd July 1897. Only five lunatics were thus handed over. The further communication on the subject promised by the Surgeon-General has not yet been submitted. 3. There was a marked decrease in the number of lunatics discharged as cured or improved, for which no explanation has been suggested. The statement of previous occupations of the patients exhibits no noticeable variation from those of previous years except in the case of soldiers, of whom a large number (10) were admitted. 4. Mania was again the prevailing type of insanity. The proportion of cases treated in which it was found possible to assign a specific cause of insanity remained almost the same as in 1896, namely, 73 per cent. Ganja smoking continues to be shown as the chief physical cause of insanity, but the Surgeon-General has again omitted to offer any remarks on the correctness of this diagnosis upon which doubts were expressed by Government in reviewing the reports for 1895 and 1896. 5. The accommodation in all three asylums was sufficient. Proposals for additions to, and improvements on, the buildings of the Madras asylum have been received and are now under consideration. Provision has been made in the Public Works Department budget for the current year for the execution of the works sanctioned in G.O., No. 1701, Judicial, dated 28th October 1896.
No. 699, Public, 25th Mat 1898. 6. Sanitation.The Government is glad to learn that sanitation and general hygiene received special attention. The recommendations of the Superintendent of the Madras asylum that the good conduct pay sanctioned in G.O., $o. 874, dated 26th April 1895, should be merged into an increased monthly salary, and that the proportion of sweepers to insanes should be raised, should form the subject of separate communications. &quot;With regard to the provision of huts for sweepers at the Madras asylum it will be pointed out to the Surgeon-General that G.O., No. 1701, Judicial dated 28th October 1896, quoted by him, did not sanction the erection of huts, but returned for revision the estimates submitted to Government. 7. From the statistics of weighments it appears that, while the proportion of patients admitted during the year who gained weight was larger than in 1896 in all three asylums, there was a considerable falling off in the Madras and Vizagapatam asylums in the proportion of patients treated whose weight increased. No explanation of this has been suggested. The weighment result of the experimental use of cholam in the Calicut asylum appears to be very satisfactory, and to justify an extended use of that grain. 8. The Government notes with pleasure the interest taken by Sri Eaja G. N. Gajapathi Rao, c.i.e., and His Highness the Zamorin, in the asylums at Vizagapatam and Calicut. 9. Health.The following table compares the health of the inmates of the three asylums for the last three years : Percentage of Tear. Daily average strength. Daily average hick.

The principal diseases for which patients were admitted to hospital were the same as in the former years. Tubercle of the lungs, which in 1895 and 1896 was returned as the cause of admission to hospital in a large number of cases, has this year almost disappeared. It is observed that the Surgeou-General has not replied to the enquiries of Government with regard to this disease in the reviews of the last two years. Starvation appears as the cause of ten admissions to hospital and two deaths in the Madras asylum. &quot;While there was an appreciable decrease in sickness in the Madras and Vizagapatam asylums, the proportion of sick in the Calicut asylum has advanced year by year. In reviewing the report for 1896, the Government invited the Surgeon-General's attention to this fact, and observed that it could not accept as conclusive the suggestion that the advance was due to the admission into hospital of all weakly inmates of this asylum. No explanation has been ottered in the present report. The Government trusts that the matter will receive the careful attention of the Surgeon-General. 11. No epidemics occurred in the Madras or Vizagapatam asylums: cholera occurred in the Calicut asylum, and the necessary steps for segregating patients and preventing the spread of the disease were duly taken. 12. Finance including Manufactures.The following table compares the total cost of, and the cost per head of average strength in, each of the three asylums in the years 1896 and 1897 :

A. r. 119 3 1 115 5 9 The reduction in the average cost per head in the Madras and Calicut asylums has been effected in spite of a great rise in the price of grain and is noted with satisfaction. The rise in the cost in the Vizagapatam asylum is attributed to the high prices of food, owing to famine, and to increased establishment charges. In spite of these additional expenses the total cost per head, as well as the cost per head for diets, continues to be far less at Yizagapatam than in the other asylums. The high cost in Madras is partly due to the comparatively large number of European diets supplied. It is also observed that there has been an increase in the number of paying patients whose fees are separately credited to Government, so that the actual cost to the State is somewhat less than appears in the foregoing table. 13. The profits from manufactures declined, the average profit per head of those employed on remunerative labour being considerably less than in 1896 in the Madras and Vizagapatam asylums. No reason is assigned for this falling off. In spite of the remarks in the review of the report for 1896, the number of patients employed on remunerative labour in the Madras asylum showed no improvement, nor has any explanation of the smallness of their number been offered. The Surgeon-General has not explained the great excess in the number of working days in the Madras asylum as compared with the other institutions, which was referred to in last year's review. Work is apparently carried on in the Madras asylum on most Sundays, which would seem undesirable as depriving the establishment of its day of rest. The Surgeon-General is requested to report on this point. 14. The report is, on the whole, a satisfactory one. Surgeon-Captain Xeet Palk's administration of the Madras asylum was, as usual, efficient, while the asylum at Vizagapatam, though labouring under disadvantages owing to famine, continued, under Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel Leapingwell's capable management, to compare favourably with the other two institutions in many respects. The Government notes with pleasure the steady improvement in the Calicut asylum. Since the receipt of the Surgeon-General's report His Excellency the Governor in Council has heard with regret of the death of Assistant Surgeon Judge, whose valuable assistance in the administration of the Madras asylum had on several occasions been brought to the favourable notice of Government The Surgeon-General's commendation of the hospital assistants in all three asylums is noted with satisfaction.

ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 5 (1) Military and Civil Lunatics.From the above it will be seen that of Military and Civil Lunatics there remained on the 1st January 318 males and 118 females; admissions during the year numbered 86 and 26, respectively, and I female was re-admitted; 29 males and 7 females were discharged cured; II males and 1 female left the asylums much improved; 1 male from the Madras Asylum was taken over by his relations without any improvement in his condition. Of ' discharged otherwise,' there were 13 males and 2 females ; of this last group, 4 Military lunatics were transferred to England. 29 males and 14 females died during the year. At the end of the year there remained under treatment 321 males and 121 females. The average daily strength of the sexes was 323*49 and 118*38, the ratio per cent, being 73-21 males and 26*79 females, as compared with 72*05 males and 27*95 females the average ratio for the preceding ten years. (2) Criminal Lunatics.The above details in relation to Criminal Lunatics may be gathered from Statement II. It is only necessary to remark here that of the admissions, 4 had been tried and acquitted, 12 were under-trial prisoners incapable of a making a defence, and 3 were cases that became insane during confinement in jail. (3) General.(a) The religions of new admissions are given in Statement III. The Madras Presidency furnished 16 European and East Indian and 10 Native Christians, 67 Hindus, 15 Muhammadans, and 11 of ' other castes.' (b) In Statement IV are detailed the previous occupations of insanes admitted during the year. In 24 cases the occupation was not known, and 18 others were reported to have no occupation. Of the remainder92 in numberthere were unskilled labourers 15, cultivators 13, and sepoys 11. (c) In Statement Y is tabulated the ages of new admissions. 96 were admitted between the ages of 20 and 40 years, and 28 between 40 and 60 years, forming, respectively, 71*64 and 20*90 per cent, of the total. The corresponding ratios for the preceding ten years are 70*40 and 22*62. (d) The distribution of the lunatics, according to types of insanity (vide Statement VI), gives the following particulars : -------------------- ( Remained. Admitted. Total. Died, discharged, eto.

The escapes during the year numbered 3 from the Madras Asylum, 1 from Vizagapatam, and 4 from Calicut. Two of the Madras insanes, the Vizagapatam one and two of the Calicut inmates were captured during the year 1898, and another Calicut male was brought back after the beginning of the current year. The warders concerned were severely punished, and the police have been informed of the parties still at large. (&) Accommodation (1) Sufficiency.The available accommodation and the extent to which it is utilized is as follows : Accommodation. Maximum number of inmates on any one day. General. Sick. Madras Vizagapatam Calicut 643 78 123 46 13 12 437 75 87 (2) New constructions.(a) Of completed works there are in Madras a new room added to the office block ; the hospital assistant's quarters and the nurses' day-room in the female hospital enclosure. In Vizagapatam a cook-room on the standard plan for jails was completed by the Public Works Department, but had not been handed over at the end of the year. (b) The following works are in progress:In Madras, a new block in the criminal enclosure; a ward for European males in the hospital enclosure; the extension of the general kitchen, and the isolation section. In Calicut, the office building is in course of construction. (3) Repairs executed.The usual annual repairs such as lime-washing, tarring, shifting and replacing tiles, &c, wore carried out in all three asylums. In Vizagapatam the repairs to the main femalo ward were completed. In Calicut wooden screens were fitted to all the the cells ; and 4 open cooking-sheds (not in use) were converted into female bath-room, lamp-room, gardener's store-room, and fowl-house.
ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 7 (4) State of repair.The Madras Asylum buildings are in good condition. Jn Vizagapatam repairs were estimated for, but had not been taken in hand at the close of the year. In Calicut the buildings have repeatedly been declared to be in unsatisfactory condition, and Government in Proceedings R. No. 51, dated 9th January 1899, called for an estimate for the repairs required. The Public Works Department was addressed on the subject. (5) Hospital accommodation.The hospital accomodation in the Madras Asylum is being improved under G.O., No. 3467 W., dated 4th December 1896. The male hospital enclosure has had the south and east compound walls lowered to 9 feet,, and has been extended by the demolition of the wall which separated it from the noisy enclosure. A ward to accommodate 12 European males is also being added, and will soon be finished. In Vizagapatam and Calicut female patients are treated in the ordinary single rooms as occasion requires; but separate accommodation exists for 13 and 12 male patients, respectively. (c) Sanitation (1) Conservancy.In Madras the conservancy arrangements have been somewhat modified. Kerosine-oil tins fitted with handles have been found cheap, convenient and efficient substitues for the old filth buckets. Some portable pumps have been introduced to supplant the old and tedious practice of baling out the sewage cisterns. The sweepers still prefer employment anywhere rather than at the asylum, and especially try to get on in Municipal service where husband and wife are almost always jointly employed. The huts for sweepers, sanctioned in G.O., No. 1701, Judicial, dated 28th October 1896, had not been begun in 1898. In Vizagapatam the * dry-earth' system is carried out, the night-soil being converted into poudrette in the dry season and buried in trenches in the rains. In Calicut dry-earth is used in the detached latrines, and the flushing system is adopted for the night latrines attached to the cells; the night-soil is utilized as at Vizagapatam. (2) General hygiene of the insanes.Particular attention has, as usual, been paid to the bathing, clothing, exercise, and food of the insanes. The Superintend^ ent of the Madras Asylum recommends for consideration(a) the artificial heating of certain rooms for such cases as need special protection from cold and exposure, and (b) the adoption of means to distribute food warm, from the kitchen to the various sections. The former item is held in abeyance for want of a well-defined scheme to put before Government; and the latter will be made the subject of special representation after the new kitchen (sanctioned in G.O., No. 923, Public, dated 16th July 1898) is completed and in working order. (3) Drainage.In Madras the plan and estimates for improving the drainage have been sanctioned in G.O., No. 1485, Public, dated 8th December 1898. In Vizagapatam the drainage is natural and satisfactory. In Calicut the work sanc^ tioned in G.O., No. 1311, Public, dated 2nd October 1897, has not as yet been begun. In Madras and Calicut therefore the drainage is bad. (4) Water-supply.The Madras Asylum has an ample supply of Red Hills water, and also six wells, the water from which is used for agricultural purposes. In Vizagapatam for the first half of the year the water was carted and carried by the insanes from temporary wells in the bed of a tank outside the premises; subsequently the asylum well furnished all requirements. At Calicut also the supply from January to June was obtained from a tank outside the asylum ; and for the re3t of the year the wells in the compound yielded an abundant supply. (d) Miscellaneous (1) Food and iveighments.Itagi was, as heretofore, the staple grain in use in the Madras Asylum; but the Superintendent reports that to improve the general health of some insanes and to induce certain others to work rice diets were more frequently ordered during 1898 than in previous years. In the Vizagapatam Asylum cumboo and cholam are the grains in use ; and the Superintendent considers them to be satisfactory, liice is the staple food-grain ia Culicut.

(2) Clothing,In the Madras Asylum cotton clothing was supplied to all in-sanes; and for the sick and weakly patients flannel banians and woollen jerseys were added. For destructive maniacs special garments of canvas drill and gunny not removable by the wearers were introduced, and proved useful not only in restraining the patients so dressed but also in some cases restoring the sense of decency and the desire for clothes; and lastly gunny-bag mattresses filled with straw have been advantageously employed as beds for old and feeble cases. In the asylums at Vizagapatam and Calicut each patient is supplied with two suits of cotton clothing, cumbly jackets being added for the sick and aged. (3) Industries and employments.Agricultural work and weaving are the chief industries in the Madras Asylum, and engaged the majority of the native patients of both sexes. A few found work in mat-making. The general conservancy of the premises occupied some native males, and others were selected to help the asylum tradesmen and to assist in the kitchen and laundry. The starting of a sewing class gave employment to some of the European and Eurasian females. A scheme to provide employment for European and Eurasian malessuch as cane-work, netting, fret-work, &c.is under contemplation, and will be submitted separately. Gardening and weaving are the chief employments in the Vizagapatam Asylum, and these are supplemented by the preparation of grain-flour for asylum use and also light tin-work. In the Calicut Asylum also gardening and weaving formed the more important occupations, while coir yarn-twisting and mat-making engaged some insanes, and others were employed in cleaning the premises.
ANNUAL REPOET ON LUNATIC ASfLUMS. 9 In both Vizagapatam and Calicut the conveying of water for asylum purposes from sources outside the premises was, as already mentioned, a temporary employment. (4) Amusements.In the Madras Asylum these comprised (a) a monthly treat at which the Madras Volunteer Guards band plays, with permission of the Officer Commanding; light refreshments are provided ; (b) occasional magic-lantern exhibitions with songs and dances ; (c) a special treat at Christmas with sports, &c. ; (d) out-door games including quoits, foot-ball and bowls; in-door games of draughts, cards, &c, for the Europeans and other games for the natives. The bullock-coach formerly used by the St. Mary's Church Choristers was (by G.O., No. 847, Public, dated 4th July 1898) made over to the Superintendent, Lunatic Asylum, Madras. A pair of bullocks had been arranged for, but had not arrived by the end of the year. At Vizagapatam the annual treat to the insanes was again given by Sri Maharaja G-. N. Gajapati Rao, c.i.e., presents of fruit for the inmates were sent by the Raja of Kurapam. Singing and native music, chess and cards formed daily amusements. On one occasion an acrobatic performance was given free by some travelling performers ; and on another some selected inmates were sent out to witness a native drama. In the Calicut Asylum the inmates were daily permitted to play at native games (chess, kolatam, &c.) from 10 to 12 a.m., the rearing of domestic pets (birds, squirrels, a cat and a monkey) was permitted to those whose bent in that direction could safely be indulged ; and some of the well-behaved were taken out for local sight-seeing. Dramatic and acrobatic performances were given at nominal charges by local troupes ; and on some occasions certain inmates were allowed to get up performances themselves. Mr. M. Assan Koya Hajee supplied a bag of rice for the inmates ; food and refreshments were furnished by Mr. M. Gopala Menon, Dr. Appu Menon, Mrs. K. Chirutha Ammal and others; and treats were given on Onam, Yishu and Christmas holidays. n.STATISTICS OF HEALTH AND TREATMENT OF THE SICK. (1) Sickness and its causes.In the Madras Asylum admissions into hospital numbered 387. Excluding 141 cases of mania and epilepsy, 13 cases of old age and 16 cases of surfeit, which were sent to the hospital as needing special care, the remainder were largely due to chicken-pox, tubercle, itch, bronchitis and catarrhal inflammation of the intestines. The daily average of sick was 56*30 against 48*07 in 1897. In the Vizagapatam Asylum there were 47 admissions, 18 of whom were cases of simple continued fever. The average daily sick was 3*83 against 3*11 in the previous year. In the Calicut Asylum there were 81 admissions and a daily average sick of 15*12 as compared with 159 and 26*36, respectively, in the preceding year. Catarrhal inflammation of the stomach and intestines contributed the largest number of admissions. (2) Forcible feeding and methods in use.In the Madras Asylum 20 cases were fed by the naso-pharyngeal tube. In Vizagapatam 6 patients were fed by hand; none required feeding by tube. In Calicut 9 patients were fed by hand and 1 by naso-pharyngeal tube. (3) Mortality and its causes.In Madras Asylum 28 deaths in and 4 out of hospital occurred during the year as against 37 in the previous year. The cases were mainly due to tubercle 6, dysentery 3 and mania 3. The four deaths out of hospital were due to mania with syncope 2, cerebral apoplexy with coma 1, and epilepsy with asphyxia 1. In Vizagapatam the death-rate rose to 6 as compared with 1 in 1897. Two were cases of chronic mania, 2 others were paralytic, 1 was an epileptic and died from exhaustion, and the last died from hypertrophic cirrhosis of the liver. In Calicut there occurred 8 deaths as compared with 21 in the preceding year. Three were cases of advanced old age and 2 were pronounced cases of tubercle. 3
10 ANNUAL REPOKT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. (4) Epidemics and how they were dealt with.In the Madras Asylum there occurred an epidemic of chicken-pox. Government in G.O., No. 1307, Public, dated 2dth October 1&98, sanctioned a quarantine block of four cells and a latrine for use by the infected patients. Thirty-two cases in all were treated. The other asylums were free from epidemics. Vaccination and re-vaccination have been regularly carried on in each asylum. (5) Injuries received in the asylum. In the Madras Asylum one slight case of self-inflicted hurt occurred and ended in recovery. In Vizagapatam an insane suffered an accidental slight scald in the kitchen. In Calicut there were no injuries. (6) Hospital diet and extras.The hospital diets are those laid down in G.O., No. 1, Public, dated 1st January 1889. The scale was found both ample and well-suited to the requirements of the sick. * Europeans Natives Rs. A. p. 3,098 4 3 3,209 11 0 In the Madras Asylum the total cost came to Rs. 6,307-15-3,* and the average cost Total 6,307 15 3 of a hospital diet with extras was annas 5-8-J. In Vizagapatam hospital diet cost Rs. 36-7-5 and the extras cost Rs. 4-0-8. The average cost of the hospital diet with extras amounted to annas 2-7. In Calicut Asylum the cost of hospital diet and extras amounted to Rs. 1,656-11-5. The average cost of a hospital diet with extras was annas 4-9f. 7. Nursing of the sick.In the Madras Asylum there are a matron and three nurses. The duties of the matron and head nurse are entirely confined to the female section; the other nurses were employed alternately as day and night nurse in the male hospital. In Vizagapatam and Calicut Asylums no separate nursing establishments are maintained. In all three asylums a certain number of the ordinary attendants were employed as hospital attendants. In my opinion the members of the hospital staff should be male and female ward attendants trained in the General Hospital for at least a year, and then transferred to the Madras Lunatic Asylum for a course of special training in sick nursing for the insane; they ought also to be a little better paid than the ordinary male and female attendants. I have directed the Superintendent of the Lunatic Asylum, Madras, to draw up a scheme for their training to be submitted to Government. III.FINANCE INCLUDING MANUFACTUEES. I.

(b) The increase under this item was almost wholly due to the laudable efforts made at the Madras Asylum for the extended sale of lucerne; it would have been greater but for the fact that new lucerne seed had to be purchased after the heavy monsoon rains. (c) The value of clothing supplied to the asylums was increased owing to the severe monsoon and the necessary protective measures. (d) In Madras the asylum kitchen was supplied with vegetables for almost the whole year. In Vizagapatam a large crop of cumboo was grown in the asylum compound for use of the inmates. In Calicut gardening realised less than in 1897 owing to certain outstandings at the end of the year. (e) This has fallen owing to less demand for and sale of manufactured goods. (v) Booh adjustments.The increase under this item is due to the outlay by the Public Works Department on new constructions at the Madras Asylum.

(1) General Administration.The general administration of the asylums was satisfactory. (2) Establishment. (a) General-Madras Asylum.The late Assistant Surgeon H. H. M. Judge was Deputy Superintendent until 8th April. His untimely death deprived the asylum of a most zealous and efficient Deputy Superintendent, and one who deserved praise for the untiring and kindly care he exercised in all matters relating to the welfare and comfort of the patients. His successor, Senior Assistant Surgeon, S. 0. White, is declared to be painstaking and energetic. The European attendants are reported to have worked well; one was degraded owing to an escape from the criminal enclosure. The matron and nurses have given satisfaction in their work. The steward K. Annu Chetty was under suspension during the latter part of the year for certain irregularities in his department; he has since been declared medically unfit for his work or similar service, and his papers have been submitted for pension. The native attendants and ayahs have worked well; and the tvtks have done good work as well.

No. 574, Public, 24th May 1899. GOVERNMENT OF MADRAS PUBLIC DEPARTMENT. Readthe following papers : From the Surgeon-General with the Government of Madras, dated 15th April 1899, No, T. 8-112. Abstract.Forwarding annual report on the lunatic asylums in the Madras Presidency for 1898. From the Surgeon-General with the Government of Madras, dated 23rd April 1899, No. T. 8-141. OrderNo. 574, Public, dated 24th May 1899. The report on the working of the lunatic asylums in the Presidency for the year 1898 was submitted punctually. 2. Population and Accommodation.The following table compares the statistics of the population of the asylums for the last two years: Population at beginning of.'year. Admissions. Discharged. Died. Remaining at end of year. Year. i la 8 CO B la a 6 ft 13 &copy; to S &#9632; CO 8 13 a &laquo; Cured or improved. e CO 1 s 3 o Males. &#9632; Females. 13 of B 8 3 o 1897 441 140 684 130 28 158 79 24 103 37 22 59 447 133 680 1898 447 133 680 105 29 134 75 16 91 31 15 46 442 135 577 Of the 580 patients on the rolls at the beginning of the year, 436 were civil and 144 criminal insanes. The 134 admissions included 113 of the former and 21 of the latter class. The further communication from the Surgeon-General, referred to in paragraph 2 of the review of the report for 1897, as to the possibility of handing over harmless civil lunatics to the care of their friends or relatives, was received in November 1898, and recorded in G.O., No. 1521, Public, dated 14th December 1898. From that letter it appears that, since 1897, enquiries were instituted in 114 cases in the three asylums, and that it was found possible to make over to their relatives only eight insanes from the Madras Asylum, and one from the Vizagapatam Asylum. In the remaining cases no information could be obtained as to friends or relatives, or the relatives were either unwilling or too poor to receive the insanes. 3. The number of lunatics discharged as cured or improved was less by four than in 1897. The statement showing the religions of new admissions exhibits no great variation from that of the previous year. The usual large proportion of cultivators appears in the statement of the previous occupation of the patients. There was a considerable decrease in the number of beggars admitted, and a noticeable increase in the number of unskilled labourers, and of persons of unknown professions. 4. As in previous years, mania was the prevailing type of insanity. Epileptic forms of mania, melancholia and dementia showed a steady increase. The proportion of cases in which specific causes of insanity wore assigned was 71 per cent.,
No. 574, Public, 24th May 1899. against 73 per cent, in 1897. There was a considerable decrease in the number of admissions considered to be due to Ganja smoking and to other intoxicants, and this result is attributed to a more careful observation of the facts in each case. On the other hand, a larger proportion of cases of unknown origin is shown. 5. The accommodation in all three asylums was in excess of the maximum number of inmates on any one day. In the Madras Asylum considerable additions have been completed or are in progress. The issue of orders with regard to the repair of the Vizagapatam and Calicut Asylum buildings was deferred pending the receipt of final instructions from the Government of India as to abolition or retention of the Vizagapatam Asylum, in which question the future constitution of the Calicut Asylum was also involved. It was finally resolved that no change should be made, and since then the execution of the necessary improvements to the buildings at Vizagapatam has been ordered, and estimates for the repairs needed at Calicut have been called for. 6. Sanitation.It is satisfactory to note that sanitation and general hygiene continued to receive special attention. The Surgeon-General will again be reminded that G.O., No. 1701, Judicial, dated 28th October 1896, did not sanction the erection of huts for sweepers but returned for revision the estimates submitted to Government. The revised estimate for the work was approved in G.O., No. 872, Public, dated 9th July 1898, and sanctioned in G.O., No. 2399 W., Public Works, dated 16th September 1898, and provision of funds for this and other works at the Madras Asylum has been made in the budget estimate of the Public Works Department for 1899-1900. 7. Miscellaneous.The statistics of weighments show a general increase of weight among the patients treated during the year. Of those admitted during the year, 83 per cent, at Vizagapatam and 75 per cent, at Calicut gained in weight, while the proportion at Madras was 55 per cent. Of those discharged, the entire number from the Vizagapatam Asylum had gained in weight since their admission, while the ratio per cent, of those who gained at Madras and Calicut was 56 and 69, respectively. 8. The Government learns with satisfaction that the amusement of the patients received increased attention, and is gratified to note the interest in the asylums evinced by Sri Maharaja G. N. Gajapati Eao, c.i.e., at Vizagapatam, and by M. Assai Koza Haji, M.E.Ry. M. Gopala Menon Avargal, D. Appu Menon, Mrs. K. Chevatha ammal and others at Calicut. 9. Health.The following table compares the health of the inmates of the three asylums for the last three years : Percentage of Tear. Daily average strength. Daily average sick.

Tubercle of the lungs, which had almost disappeared in 1897, is again shown as the cause of admission to hospital in a large number of cases. There was an increase over the previous year in daily average of sick in the Madras Asylum, while the number of deaths was less. In the Vizagapatam Asylum, the daily average of sick remained almost stationary, while the number of deaths rose from one in each of );he two previous years to six in 1898. The deaths,(however, appear to have been due
No. 574, Public, 24th May 1899. to unavoidable causes, and the comparatively high death-rate cannot be considered to reflect any discredit on the medical administration of the asylum. There was a marked and satisfactory decrease both in sickness and mortality in the Calicut Asylum, and three out of the eight deaths which occurred there were due to advanced age. 11. Beyond an outbreak of chicken-pox in the Madras Asylum, from which there were no deaths, all three asylums were free from epidemics. 12. Finance including Manufactures.The following table compares the total cost of, and the cost per head of average strength in, each of the three asylums in the years 1897 and 1898 : Madras. Vizagapatam. Galiout. Tear. Total Cost per head of Total CoBt per head of Total Cost per head of cost. average strength. cost. average strength. cost. average strength. M. as. a. p. as. KB. A. P.

The increase at Madras was due to enhanced establishment charges, to the purchase of large stocks of diet articles and bedding, and to the payment of bills for medical stores supplied in 1897. The increase at Vizagapatam is hardly noticeable, and that at Calicut was due mainly to the purchase of weaving materials, and to the payment for medicines supplied in the previous year. At Madras there was a slight decrease in the number of paying patients. There was a satisfactory increase in the profits from manufactures in all three asylums, the average profit per head at Madras being move than double that of 1897. Gardening operations at Madras also showed a considerable advance. With reference to the remarks made in last year's review regarding Sunday labour in the Madras Asylum, the Surgeon-General has since explained that no work is carried out on Sundays beyond watering and weeding the gardens, which is not laborious, but gives pleasant occupation to the inmates, who would otherwise be idle. 13. General.The report, on the whole, is again satisfactory. The death of Assistant Surgeon Judge was noticed with regret, and his valuable services to the Madras Asylum were acknowledged, in the review of the report for 1897. The Government is glad to learn that the asylum has been provided with an efficient successor in Senior Assistant Surgeon White, and notes with satisfaction the favourable remarks made by the Surgeon General on the conduct and work of other subordinates in all three asylums.

Of the admissions, 5 had been tried and acquitted, 21 were under-trial prisoners incapable of making a defence, and 7 had become insane during confinement in jail. (3) General.(a) In Statement III are given the 'religion* of new admissions as well as their residence. Christians numbered 31, of whom 17 were natives ; the rest comprised 87 Hindus, 25 Muhammadans, and 8 of * other castes.' One hundred and twenty-eight admissions were residents of the Madras Presidency; 13 were brought from Burma ; Coorg and Hyderabad sent 3, respectively, while Pondicherry furnished 2, and Mysore and Cochin 1 patient each. (b) The occupations of those admitted are given in Statement IV. Twenty-seven cases are returned under the heading ' unknown,' and 5 were declared to have no occupation. Soldiers and sepoys numbered J4; 17 were agriculturists and 22 were unskilled labourers. (c) Statement V exhibits the ayes of those admitted.

6 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. A comparatively larger proportion of epileptics was discharged in 1899 than heretofore, and the number of that class now remaining is less than at the end of 1898. (e) The causes of admission are given in Statement VII, from which the following is abstracted: ------ 1899. Preceding ten years. Number. llatio per cent. nuS! | Kati0 Per ccnt- Ganja smoking- Other intoxicants Fever Other physical causes Moral causes Unknown Total ... 7 6 2 -48 35 53 4-G4 3 97 1-33 31-79 23-17 35-1U 17-4 11-7 2-7 74-7 42 -8 40'9 915 6*15 1-42 39*28 22-50 21-50 151 ... 1902 As remarked in the report for 1898 the admissions under intoxicants among physical causes and under moral causes are declining in frequency; but cases returned as of unknown origin continue to increase. These changes are due, no doubt, to the greater caution exercised during recent years in determining causes of admission. (/) The escapes were one female criminal from the Madras Asylum, who was re-captured after a fortnight; two male civil insanes from the \rizagapatam Asylum both re-captured, and one male civil lunatic from the Calicut Asylum still at large. The escape of a non-criminal insane is a matter of little or no consequence, for so long as he can elude discovery and take care of himself there is in most cases no particular need for his detention. There is always a suspicion that in asylums where such incidents never occur restraints are more rigid than are compatible with conditions best suited for the recovery of the inmates. It is different with criminal insanes who should, at any rate until the probationary stage is reached, be as carefully guarded as ordinary prisoners. 2. Accommodation (1) Siifficunirij.The available accommodation and the extent to which it was utilized are as shown below: Accommodation. Maximum number of inmates on any one day. 14ti 7&raquo;i 81 ! General. Uospital. Madras VizBgapatam Culicut ...... 589 78 123 100 13 12 (2) New, constructions.(a) Of completed works there are in Madras a new block in the criminal enclosure; a ward for Europeans in the male hospital enclosure; an ' isolation section,' separately enclosed, comprising four blocks with attached out-houses; an extension of the kitchen and a new range ; a noisy enclosure, and dining shed therein ; a dining shed in the male criminal enclosure, and another in the female enclosure ; an extension of the weaving room; covered passages in the male and female hospital enclosures; and lines for the sweepers. In Vizagapatam the cook-room constructed by the Public Works Department in 1898 on the standard plan for jails was taken over last year, but found unsuitable for a Lunatic Asylum. Certain proposals have been submitted for modifying the same. In Calicut a Superintendent's office was erected ; and out-houses, servants' quarters and stables were attached to the Superintendent's quarters ; masonry drains were constructed round the refractory wards and the kitchen, and huts were provided for the sweepers. (/.) There are no works in progress.
ANNUAL EEPOKT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. (3) Repairs executed.The usual annual repairs such as lime-washing, tarring, shifting and renewing tiles, &c, were carried out in all three asylums. In Madras the water-pipes were largely renewed; in Vizagapatam improvements and repairs were made to three male cottages and six male single rooms ; while in Calicut the two open kitchens attached to the male wards and an open shed in the old criminal enclosure were converted into godowns for the storage of tools, garden implements and kerosine-oil stock. (4) State of repair.The Madras Asylum buildings are in good condition. In Vizagapatam the buildings are good with the exception of the Hospital Assistant's quarters, which, in my opinion, can be put into order at far less cost than would be required for the reconstruction originally proposed. In Calicut the buildings are in need of extensive repairs; and Government in G.O., No. 29, Public, dated 16th January 1900, have sanctioned Us. ^,900 for the work. (5) Hospital accommodation.In the Madras Asylum this has been improved under G.O., No. 34G7 ~W\, dated 4th December 189(3 ; accommodation now exists for 80 males and 20 females. In Vizagapatam and Calicut separate accommodation exists for 13 and 12 male patients, respectively; female patients are treated in the ordinary single rooms as necessary. 3. Sanitation (1) Conservancy.The night-soil is deposited in trenches outside the asylum premises and subsequently utilized as manure in the gardens ; this method is adopted in all three asylums. The sweepers at Madras are reported to have behaved very well after the erection of their huts. (2) General hygiene of the insanes,Particular attention has been paid to the bathing, clothing, food and exercise of the insanes. (3) Drainage.This in Vizagapatam is natural and satisfactory. In Madras and Calicut the improvements sanctioned in G.O., No. 1485, Public, dated 8th December 1898, and No. 1311, Public, dated 2nd October 1897, respectively, remain to be carried out. (4) Water-supply.The Madras Asylum has an ample supply of lied Hills water for drinking purposes, and, in addition, six wells the water from which is usod for agricultural purposes, washing, &c. In Vizagapatam and Calicut water was carted in from outside the asylum grounds during the hot season owing to the drying-up of the wells of these institutions. 4. Miscellaneous (1) Food and zvcicjhmcnts.In Madras rice was more largely used than ragi under G.O., No. 232, Public, dated 24th February 1899. Cumboo and cholam continued to be the grains in use at Vizagapatam : and rice was, as heretofore, tho staple food-grain at Calicut. Fortnightly weighments were made throughout the year. The following table compares the weighments in the three asylums : Of those treated during the year 1899. 1 1 tOf those uhuitted during lie your. ^ a b &gt;H O 1 h o u o , 1 H u r 3 o . 3 oc: O ^5 9 A 9 J2 rt c 3 o _&lt; S - -pg 4j) ,TC3 j3 ~ 00 o? u r ?

(2) Clothing.In the three asylums cotton clothing was supplied to all insan.es, and for the sick and aged flannel banians and woollen jerseys were added at Madras and cuinbly jackets at Yizagapatam and Calicut. (3) Industries and employments.For native insanes gardening and weaving are the chief employments. These were supplemented in Madras by aiding the asylum staff in all departments, in Vizagapatam by the grinding of corn, and in Calicut by coir yarn-twisting. Mat-making engages a few at Madras and Calicut, and some at Vizagapatam are employed in light tin-work. In Vizagapatam and Calicut the conveying of water for asylum purposes from sources outside the premises was, as already mentioned, a temporary employment. European and Eurasian females are chiefly employed in needle-work, while the males help the asylum staff' in such way as it is deemed best to employ them. (4) Amusements,In Madras the Europeans and Eurasians were provided with in-door and out-door games, and some were allowed an occasional outing in the bullock-coach; the library afforded recreation to several. For the Natives games were also provided, and occasional juggling and acrobatic performances were given. In addition a monthly treat with music and light refreshments and a special Christmas treat at which small presents were distributed to deserving patients were provided. At Vizagapatam the annual treat was again given by Sri Maharaja G. N. Gajapati Eao, 0.I.E,, and the Rajah of Kurapam continued to send frequent presents of fruit. Singing and native music, chess and cards afforded daily amusements. Selected patients were sent, out to witness a native drama, and travelling acrobats gave a performance at the asylum on payment of a small, sum. In the Calicut Asylum the inmates wore supplied with games; some were allowed to rear domestic pets, and others were taken out for local sight-seeing. Among those who took an interest in the asylum may be named His Highness Tho late Zaniorin of Calicut, M.B.By. 0. M. Rarichon Muppen, and M.R.Ry. Q, Subba Row. The proprietor of the Bombay Parsi Opera Troupe gave a few selected insanes free admission to the performance, and the Karaparamba Dramatic Troupe gave a free performance on the asylum premises.

(2) Diet,The increase at Madras is due to the more liberal use of rice in lieu of ragi sanctioned in CO., No. 232, Public, dated 24th February 1899.

ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 13 (5) Contingencies.Under this heading is included the items ' contingencies ' and * cost of printed forms and stationery' detailed in Statement IX. Expenditure at Madras was particularly increased under the heads of petty repairs and lime-washing charges, funeral expenses, and railway and carriage hire for discharged patients. (6) Hospital necessaries and miscellaneous.The increase at Madras is due to the furnishing of the extended male hospital, the purchase of some new weaving looms, the replacement of iron cooking utensils by aluminium vessels, and additions to the sanitary stock. 9. Paying Patients.The numbers treated during the year were 77 at Madras and 3 at each of the other asylums, as compared with 70, 3 and 2, respectively, in 189S. The total collections realized an increase of Rs. 779-3-9 ; but at Madras there was an increase of Rs. 1,091-12-6, the diminished collections at the other asylums accounting for the deficiency. The new patients at the latter are paying less than those of 1898; and at Vizagapatam there is a sum outstanding with the Joint Magistrate, Kistna, for the year's maintenance of one patient. 10.

No. 481, Public, 23rd May 1900. GOVERNMENT OF MADEAS. PUBLIC DEPARTMENT. Beadthe following paper : Prom the Surgeon-General, dated 17th April 1900, No. 233-A. Abstract.Forwarding annual report on the Lunatic Asylums in the Madras Presidency for 1899. OrderNo. 481, Public, dated 23rd May 1900. The report on the working of the Lunatic Asylums in the Presidency for the year 1899 was due with the Government on the 15th April 1900, but was received only on the 21st idem. 2. Population and Accommodation.The following table compares the statistics of the population of the asylums for the last two years: Population at beginning of year. Admissions. Discharge. Died. Remaining at end of year. Year. CO S R CD 13 a 3 o 00 13 to CD 13 a 5 ft a +-&gt; o E- Cured or improved.

The 151 admissions included 118 of the former and 33 of the latter class. 3. The number of lunatics discharged as cured or improved was more by 26 than in 1898. The statement of the previous occupation of the patients exhibits a much greater variety of professions than in the previous year. One-fifth of the total admissions were drawn from the cultivator and cooly classes, and nearly a similar proportion were of unknown occupation. 4. Mania was again the prevailing type of insanity, and epileptic forms of mania, melancholia and dementia continued to show an increase. The additional information in connection with statement No. VI required by the Director-General of Statistics, and called for in endorsement No. 1075, Public, dated 20th April 1900, will be awaited. The proportion of cases in which specific causes of insanity were assigned was 65 per cent, against 71 per cent, in 1898. The increase in the number of cases returned as of unknown origin is attributed by the Surgeon-General to the greater caution exercised in determining causes of admission. 5. The accommodation in all three asylums was sufficient. The Surgeon-General's remarks in paragraph 2 (4) regarding the hospital assistam's quarters in the Vizagapatam Asylum will be communicated to the Public Works Department. 6. Miscellaneous.The statistics of woighments show a general increase of weight among the patients treated. Of those admitted during the year, 87 per cent, at Vizagapatam and 90 per cent, at Calicut gained in weight, while the proportion at Madras was 59 per cent. The steady improvement in this respect exhibited in the Calicut Asylum during the last three years is satisfactory.
No. 481, Public, 23rd Mat 1900. 7. The Government notes with pleasure the interest in the inmates of the asylums evinced by Sri Maharaja G. N. Gajapati Rao, c.i.b., and the Kaja of Kurupam at Vizagapatam, and by the late Zamorin of Calicut, M.R.Ry. C. M. Rarichen Muppen Avargal and M.R.Ry. G. Subba Rao Avargal at Calicut. 8.

There was a satisfactory decrease in the charges of the Vizagapatam and Calicut Asylums. The total profits from manufactures were somewhat less than in the previous year, though the profit per head of patients employed in remunerative labour in the Madras Asylum shows a marked increase. The result of the Surgeon-General's enquiries as to the reason why so small a proportion of patients in that asylum is employed on remunerative labour should be reported to Government. 11. The report shows that the general administration of the asylums has been good. The improvement in all directions exhibited by the Calicut Asylum is specially satisfactory. (True Extract.) G.

ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 5 (1) Military and Civil Lunatics.On the 1st January there remained 305 males and 116 females; admissions during the year numbered 91 males and 36 females, of which 3 males and 2 females were re-admissions ; 61 males and 15 females were discharged cured ; 9 males and 3 females left the asylum much improved ; I male and 2 females were removed without any improvement, and 8 males were &quot;discharged otherwise.&quot; Twenty-four males and 15females died during the yeara percentage mortality of 8*17 males and 13*65 females on the daily average of this class. At the end of the year there remained under treatment 293 males and 117 females. The average daily strength of the sexes was 293*76 males and 109*89 females, the ratio per cent, being 72*77 and 27*23, respectively, as compared with 73*28 and 26*72 in the preceding year. (2) Criminal Lunatics.Similar particulars to the foregoing in relation to criminal lunatics are detailed in Statement II. Of the admissions 6 were tried and acquitted, 21 were under-trial prisoners incapable of making a defence, and 7 were cases that became insane during confinement in jail. (3) General.(a) In Statement III are given the religions of the new admissions as well as their residence. Christians numbered 39, of whom 14 were natives ; the rest comprised 99 Hindus and 3 of &quot; other caste.&quot; One hundred and thirty-three admissions were residents of the Madras Presidency, 13 were brought from Burma, Coorg and Belgaum contributed 4 each, Mysore and Hyderabad Assigned Districts 2 each, and 1 each from Singapore, Ce}donand the Andamans. (6) The occupations of those admitted are given in Statement IV. Twenty-two were returned under the heading * unknown,' and 18 were declared to have no occupation. Soldiers and sepoys numbered 16 ; 15 were agriculturists and 25 unskilled labourers. (c) Statement V exhibits the ages of those admitted. Contrasted with the statistics for 1899 they appear as follows : , , ------ 1800. Ratio per cent. for 1899. Number. Ratio per cent.

From the above statement it will be seen that insanity has been assigned to a specific cause in 83 cases, or 51*55 per cent, of admissions. There is a decrease under Ganja smoking,' ' other intoxicants,' ' other physical causes,' and ' Moral causes,' and an increase under ' unknown causes ' compared with 1899. Of the total admissions 34 were criminal and 127 non-criminal. (/') The escapes were one male civil insane from the Madras Asylum who is still at large, from the Vizagapatam Asylum one female escaped, but was recaptured within a couple of hours. Two male civil lunatics escaped from the asylum at Calicut, but were brought back by the asylum servants. There were no escapes among the criminal population. 2. Accommodation (1) Sufficiency.It will be seen from the following table that the accommodation was at all times ample : Accommodation. Maximum number of inmates on any one day. General. Hospital. Madras Vizagapatam Calicut 589 78 123 100 18 12 456 74 89 (2) New constructions.(a) In Madras a house for the bullock-coach was completed. In Vizagapatam the block of three single rooms for females was completed, and the four corner rooms attached to the hospital, originally constructed for store-rooms and bath-rooms, were converted into single rooms. No new constructions were carried out in the Calicut Asylum. (b) There are no works in progress. (3) Repairs executed.In Madras the water-pipes were repaired and renewed, and minor repairs to buildings carried out. In Vizagapatam the female cottage, hospital building, and the well were repaired, and the Hospital Assistant's quarters and cook-room are undergoing alterations. In Calicut the usual turning and replacing tiles, colour and white-washing, tarring, thatching, etc., were carried out. (4) State of Repair.The Madras Asylum buildings are in a good state of repair and so generally are those at Vizagapatam, but the roof of the female cottage and the warders' lines need overhauling. At Calicut the buildings which were allowed to fall into disrepair are being attended to by the Public Works Department. About Rs. 1,700, out of a sanctioned estimate of Rs. 4,900, were spent during the year, but the entire work will not be completed by the end erf the official year. (5) Hospital accommodation.Hospital accommodation in all three asylums is sufficient. 3. Sanitation (1) Conservancy.The night-soil is trenched and used as manure. (2) General hygiene, of the insanes.Attention is paid to the bathing, clothing, food and exercise of all insanes.
ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. (3) Drainage.In Madras the drainage is unsatisfactory on account of the low-lie of the land. Owing to want of funds, the scheme approved of by Government in Gr.O., No. 1485, Public, dated 8th December 1898, is still in abeyance. In Vizagapatam the drainage is natural and satisfactory. In Calicut the drainage has been considerably improved by the construction of U-shaped drains round the refractory wards. (4) Water-supply.Madras has a supply of piped water from the Red Hills and from six wells. Well water is used for washing purposes and for cultivation. From last April the municipality have reduced the free allowance of piped water from 600,000 gallons per mensem to 153,447 gallons according to the scale of building tax paid. This quantity is totally inadequate for present needs. In Vizagapatam owing to scanty rainfall, the water in the' well ran dry and the supply had to be carted from a distance of three-quartera of a mile. This interfered much with the profitable employment of the insanes. In Calicut the water-supply had been sufficient during the greater part of the year. From January to June there was some scarcity which affected the garden chiefly. It is intended to put up a force-pump over the well attached to the Superintendent's quarters, and an estimate for this has been submitted to the Superintending Engineer for sanction. 4, Miscellaneous (l) Fond and weighments.In Madras rice is largely used, and in Calicut is the only cereal employed, in Vizagapatam, on the other hand, cumboo and cholum have proved fairly satisfactory. The following table compares the weighments in the three asylums : Of those treated during the year.

In Yizagapatara of the 6L under treatment throughout tho year, no less than 36 have lost weight. Of these 7 lost one lb. and less, 17 lost three lbs. and upwards, and 8 lost exactly three lbs. each. In Calicut 57*01 per cent, gained weight as compared with 70*42 per cent, in
8 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. the previous year; this is accounted for by the new standard of comparison, the admission weight being taken as the standard for two years only. (2) Clothing.In the Madras, Vizagapatam and Calicut Asylums the clothino-was satisfactory. (3) Industries and employments.The chief employments for the native insanes were gardening, weaving, dairy farming and working in tin. They were also employed on labour for which no profit is shown, such as helping in grinding and preparing the rice, ragi, and other grains, carrying wrater, sweeping the premises, and assisting the tailors, blacksmiths, carpenters, dhobies and cooks. 'In Madras the European and Eurasian female insanes were employed in needle-work and knitting. The profits on the out-turn of garden produce for the past year show a great improvement on the previous year. (4) Amusements,In Madras out-door games, sucli as foot-ball, croquet, etc., were provided. Chess and drafts helped to pass away time in-doors. The asylum library provides daily papers, periodicals and books for the better educated class. Periodical treats consisting of bands, sports, jugglers, acrobats, performing bears, etc., were provided. There was a special treat at Christmas, including a Christmas tree, when small and useful presents were distributed to those capable of appreciating them. At Vizagapatam, the annual treat was, as usual, given by Sri Maharajah Gr. N. Gajapati Rao, O.I.B., and included an acrobatic performance, display of fireworks and gifts of fruit. Entertainments were also given by the Rajah of Kurapam, Babu Nandi Lai Grhosani, a Zemindar of Sirampur in Bengal, and M.R.Ry. Motamarry Sanyasi Chetti Garu or Vizagapatam sent a present of fruits to the inmates. Throughout the year every Saturday after-noon a Brahmin priest and a barber amused the inmates by playing and singing. Tom-toms, cymbals, cards and chess were also provided, and some selected patients were sent to see the town, and witness a native drama, and travelling troupes of acrobats and jugglers, and native dramatists amused the inmates by their performances. At Calicut cards, chess and native games were provided. Annual treats were also given and several of the inmates were taken out to witness acrobatic performances given by a touring troupeand on one occasion they went out on a boating excursion and enjoyed themselves by singing, playing, and listening to the music provided for the occasion ; sumptuous meals were provided and altogether a most pleasant day was passed. A gymkhana was got up and the public admitted on payment of a small fee to witness the sports given by the inmates. Several of the inmates are allowed to rear domestic pets and others take interest in the flower garden. His Highness the Zamorin of Calicut and M.R.Ry. C. M. Rarichen Mooppen Avargal interested themselves in the cause of the lunatics by giving them treats at their own expense. The Managers of the ' West Coast Spectator,' * Kerala Patrika,' and ' Kerala Chandrika' each very kindly gave a copy of their papers for the use of the inmates. II.MEDICAL. 5.

(2) Receipts from the treasury.The decrease under this head was due to the savings effected under ' Establishment' in the Lunatic Asylum at Madras and under * Diet' in all the three asylums. (3) Receipts from paying patients.There was an increase of Rs. 479-4-10 due partly to the arrears of maintenance of an insane being collected in the Vizagapatam Asylum.

(4) Medicines.Replenishment of stock at Calicut coupled with the decline in the average strength in the other asylums contributed towards the increase in cost per head. (5) Contingencies.The increase under this item occurred only in Calicut where a sum of Rs. 187-14--3 was spent in excess for repairs and maintenance. (6) Hospital necessaries and miscello.nies.On the whole there was a saving of Its. 1,649-4-0 under this head due especially to a large reduction at Madras. 9. Paying Patients.There were 77 patients treated at Madras and 6 and 1 at V izagapatam and Calicut, respectively. The total collections realized an increase of Rs. 479-4-10, which is due partly to the recovery of the outstanding amount with the Joint Magistrate of Kistna for a year's maintenance of a patient in the Vizagapatam Asylum, and partly to an increased amount of Rs. 234-7-5 collected at Madras during the year. 10.

General Administration (1) Establishmeyit.In the Lunatic Asylum at Madras, the nursing establishment was re-organized 'and a better class of nurses entertained under G.O., No. 329 R., Financial, dated 24th March 1900. The staff of native male and female attendants, night-watchmen and night watchwomen, etc., was re-orgauized and the strength fixed irrespective of the population. Both schemes have worked satisfactorily. One nurse has been added to the hospital staff. The medical subordinate staff and the nursing establishment worked well. (2) Vizagnpahim Asylum.No special hospital establishment existsthe ordinary attendants performing the duties under the supervision of First-class Hospital As&istant Y. Anantnyya, No. 320, whose good work iu the management of the asylum is again very highly spoken of by Lieutenant-Colonel A. H. Loaphtgwell, l.M.S. The character of the native attendants is indifferent and they require constant and careful watching. Owing chiefly to the difficulty in replacing them, the toties, as usual, are a constant source of trouble. The female toty is very badly paid considering the work she does.

Govindan, Store-keeper P. Govindan, and Hospital-keeper Shekharan. 13. Notes on Visitors' Reports (1) Madras Asylum.The general tenour of the remarks made was that the condition of the inmates was good, and the sanitary condition of the grounds satisfactory. I have, paid frequent visits to the institution during the past year and Surgeon-General Harvey, D.S.O., Director-General of the Indian Medical Service, inspected the asylum with me on the 2nd December. Lieu tenant-Colonel O'Hara, I.M.S., Inspector-General of Prisons, inspected the criminal wards of the Asylum in June and December. (2) Vizagapatam Asylum.The Director-General, I.M.S., the Inspector-General of Prisons and myself each inspected the asylum once. The official visitors met once a month. (3) Calicut Asylum.The annual inspection was made by me on the 20th March. The Director-General, I.M.S., and the Inspector-General of Prisons visited the asylum during the year. Inspection reports were very satisfactory. The official visitors met once a month. 14. Inventory.The inventory of the valuable stock in all these asylums has been maintained and checked. 15. Verification of Service Books.The service books of the establishment in all three asylums have been verified up to the end of the year under report. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, (Signed) D. SINCLAIR, Surgn.-General, I.M.S., Surgeon-General with the Government of Madras. (True Copy.) A. M.

SINCLAIR, m.b., c.s.i., I.M.S., Surgeon-Geueral, with the Government of Madras, The ACTING CHIEF SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Public Department. To Sir, I have the honour to submit to His Excellency the Governor in Council the report on the Lunatic As}dum3 in the Madras Presidency for the triennial period ending 31st December 1902. 2. Statement No. IAsylum PopulationMilitary and Civil Lunatic*.On the 1st day of January 1902', the combined population of the three asylums was 568, as compared with 559 and054 on the same date in 1901 and 1900. Admissions numbered ] 12 males and 35 females, and readmissions 21, one a female, making- together a total population of 736 (564 males and 172 females), as compared with 714 (552 males and 162 females) and 715 (546 males and 169 females) during 1901 and 1900. The daily average number confined was 579-95 (435*46 males and 144*49 females) as compared with 562*85 (426*15 males and 136*70 females) and 545*45 (421*83 males and 123*62 females) in 1901 and 1900. These figures show a steady rise in the population during the triennial period due to a number of chronic and demented inmates retained in the Madras Asylum. (a) Fifty-five males and 7 females were discharged as cured, compared with 45 males'and 11 females and 67 males and 17 females in 1901 and 1900 respectively. The proportion cured to the daily average strength was 10 69 per cent, as against 9*95 and 15*40 in the two previous years. Of the inmates, 25 left the asylums &quot; improved &quot; compared with 10 and 12 of the two previous years, 4 were removed without any improvement as compared with 8 and 3, and 26 were &quot;discharged otherwise&quot; as compared with .19 and 8. The Madras Asylum is alone responsible for the increase under &quot;improved&quot; and &quot;discharged otherwise.&quot; The total number of deaths during the year under review was 45 (31 males and 14 females), as compared with 53 (41 males and 12 females) in 1901, and 49 (34 males and 15 females) in 1900, the percentage mortality on the daily average strength being 7*76 against 9*42 and 8*98. The total deaths and the percentage mortality in 1902 has not been so small since 1888. At the end of the year, 574 inmates remained under treatment as compared with 568 in 1901 and 559 in 1900. (b) The maximum number of lunatics contined at one time during the year under review in Madras was 410, as against 415 in 1901 and 403 in 1900; in Vizagapatani the maximum was 80, as against 74 in each of the two previous years; and in Calicut, 107, as against 95 and 89. There is accommodation in the Madras Asylum for 689 inmates, and in the Vizagapatam and Calicut institutions for 96 and 135; hence at all times there has been ample room. 3. Statemknt No. II.Criminal lunatics are received into the Madras Asylum only. There were 37 admissions in all, including 4 readmissions (34 males and 3 females), as compared with 34 (31 males and 3 females) in 1901 and 34 (32 males and 2 females) in 1900, Of the total admitted, 4 were tried and acquitted on the grounds of insanity, as against 5 and 6 in the two previous years; 24 were incapable of making any defence, as against 20 and 21; and 9 became insane during

Caste Hindus predominate being four times as numerous as Muhammadans ; next come Muhammadans, then Europeans and Eurasians, Native Christians, and lastly other castes. Of the European group more than half were British soldiers. 78*57 per cent, were males and 21*43 females as against 80*64 and 19*30 in 1901, and 76*39 and 23*61 in 1900. Madras Cifcy contributed the largest number, 43 as against 33 and 36 of the two previous years. Next in order comes Malabar with 35 as compared with 26 and 27 in 1901 and 1900. 5. Statement No. IV.The occupation followed by a considerable proportion of the inmates prior to admission is unascertainable or is given as &quot; nil.&quot; Such entries are recorded against 29 per cent, of the admissions, whilst coolies, cultivators, soldiers and beggars account for 32 per cent, in addition. 6. Statement No. V.Few are admitted under 20 years of age or over 60. Over 89 per cent, were between those age-periods compared with 87 per cent, for 1901 and 92 per cent, for 1900. 7. Statement No. VI.The number of admissions due to mania, which type heads the list, is 132 as compared with 119 and 116 in the two previous years; next comes melancholia with 14, as against 15 and 20; dementia with 9 as against 10 and 15 ; and idiocy 6 as against 4 and 1. Of the 736 treated during the year of review^, 70 per cent, were affected with mania, 7 per cent, with melancholia, 15 with dementia; against 69, 7 and 16 in 1901 and 67, 8 and 17 in 1900. 8. Statement No. VII.Sets forth the alleged causes of insanity. Seventy-one admissions (42'26 per cent.) are assigned to specific causes as against 41*94 per cent, in 1901 and 51*55 in 1900. Of the known causes 56 are ascribed to physical and 15 to moral causes, as against 51 and 14 during 1901 and 55 and 28 during 1900. To other physical causes, heredity, ganja smoking and epilepsy, the vast majority of known causes are assigned, followed longo intervallo by cases arising from the abuse of spirits or other* intoxicants. 9. Escapes.During 1902 no escapes from the Madras Asylum took place, but there were 4 (including 1 criminal) in 1901 and .1 in 1900. From the Vizagapatam Asylum 4 are reported as against 3 in 1901 and 1 in 1900. Of the 4 escapes in 1902, all were brought back immediately, 2 by the police and 2 by the asylum servants. From Calicut no escape occurred during the year under review, and 1 lunatic who got away in 1901 was recaptured; 2 escapes were reported in 1900. 10. New Constkuctions.In the Madras Asylum, cells are being constructed for European criminals. In the Calicut Asylum a force pump for the use of the female section has been erected during the year. No new constructions have been carried out in the Vizagapatam Asylum. 11. Rkpaihs.In Madras extensive repairs have been carried out in the kitchen; the floor has been relaid, windows enlarged, the chimney raised for the purpose of increasing draught, and the wood-work painted. The native attendants' lines have also been repaired. In Vizagapatam the kitchen has been improved, and the hospital latrine, the mortuary, the main gate to the guard room and the compound wall of the female enclosure, repaired. In Calicut the usual annual repairs bave been carried out. With the exception of the warders' lines and the out-housos of the Hospital Assistant's quarters in Vizagapatam, and the Superintendent's quarters in Calicut, the buildings in all these asylums are now in a good state of repair. 12. HOSPITAL Accommodation.With the exception of accommodation for female sick in Calicut, which is still defective, the hospital accommodation in all the asylums is sufficient and suitable.
TRIENNIAL REPORT ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS* 13. Sanitation(1) Conservancy.The dry-earth system is satisfactorily carried out in all the three asylums ; the night-soil is deposited in shallow trenches and utilized as manure. (2) General Hygiene.The arrangements for the ventilation and cleanliness of buildings are satisfactory ; particular attention is paid to bathing, clothing, food and exercise. As in previous years, rice was the staple food in Madras and Calicut, whereas cholam and cumboo were used in Vizagapatam. Fortnightly weighments were made throughout the year. (3) Drainage.In Vizagapatam and Calicut the drainage is natural and satisfactory. In Madras the improvement sanctioned in CO., No. 1485, Public, dated 8th December 1898, yet remains to be carried out. (4) Water-supply.The Madras Asylum has an ample supply of lied Hills water for drinking, cooking, and bathing purposes, in addition to which there are five wellsthe water from which is in constant use tor agricultural and washing-purposes. In Vizagapatam during 1900 and 1901 water had to be carted from outside as the well in the asyli\m compound had run dry. A new well has now been constructed in the golf-links on a site kindly given by the Maharaj (i. X. Gaja-pathi Roav, O.I.E. This well contains &lt;rood water and is not likely to run dry during the hot season. In Calicut the supply of water for drinking and cooking purposes is adequate and good. 14. Industries and Employments.The chief forms of employment wore gardening, weaving, dairy-farming, sewing, knitting, tape-making and coir-twisting. Insanes were also employed in helping to grind and prepare rice and other grains, in carrying water, sweeping the premises, and in assisting the tailors, carpenters, blacksmiths, cooks and dhobies. 15. Amusements.In Madras periodical sports were hold when tea, and fruits were distributed. Gramaphone concerts, Punch and Judy shows, and Marionette entertainments were also given and were much appreciated. The Officer Commanding the Madras Railway Volunteers very kindly lent the services of his band free of charge. There was a special treat at Christmas when presents were given and plum-pudding, cakes, sweets and fruits were distributed. In Vizagapatam the usual annual treat consisting of a special meal with sweets and fruits was given by Maharaja Sir G. N. Gajapathi Row, ice.i.e. Throughout the year every Saturday afternoon, a Brahmin priest and a barber amused the inmates by playing tom-tom,, cymhals, and singing ; cards and chess were also provided. Selected patients are sent out regularly for walks and are occasionally taken to native dramatic performances. In Calient, the amusements were of various kinds as in previous years. Periodicals were sent for the use of the inmates by the Managers of the West Coast Spectator, Manorama and Karalctchaiidrika, 16. Medical(1) Sickness and .causes. The average daily sick of the three asylums during the year under review was 47*91 as compared with 61'22 in J901 and 74*22 in 1900. The principal causes were malarial fevers, mania, epilepsy, tubercle, surfeit, dysentery, diarrhoea and worms. Diarrhoea and dysentery are very common, especially among such as are given to eating all sorts of dirt. Cases of tubercle are kept in the open air as much as possible. Three eases of leprosy in the early stage are inmates of the Madras Asylum. (2) Mortality and its causes.-The total number of deaths was 15 as compared with 53 in 1901 and 49 in 1900, with a percentage mortality calculated on the daily average strength of 7'7(&gt;, 9*42 and 8&quot;9S respectively. As usual, Madras returns the highest death-rate (9'GG), Calicut coming second (4'97) and Yizagapatam third (l'82)i Taking the mean mortality from 1890 to L89* the same order is main tained. Madras leads with 14'07, Calicut being next with 18*37 and Yizngapatan in last with fi'87. The chief causes of mortality in 1902 were tubercle of lung, dementia, epilepsy, dysentery and valvular disease of heart. As usual, tubercle of the lunkheads the list. Epilepsy and dementia also showed an upward tendency as Oomp&rod with the previous two years.
TRIENNIAL UK POET ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS. In Madras, there was one case of cholera which, proved fatal, one of accidental death, one of suicide and one case (admitted moribund) died from pneumonia. In Vizagapatain, one death occurred from hemiplegia, the patient, an epileptic, having been resident in the asylum for ten years. In Calicut, there were five deaths, all occurring within a year of admission into the asylum. Among these, was a case of sudden death from heart disease. (3) Epidemics.There were no epidemics in any of the three asylums during the year under review, though dengue was prevalent in Madras Town and its suburbs. Cholera prevailed in the Madras and Calicut Asylums during the year 1901, and influenza at Vizagapatam during the year 11)00. (4) Injuries received.The total injuries returned during the year under review were 28, 18 by Madras and 10 by Vizagapatam. Most of these were self-inflicted and not very serious except in the case of a criminal lunatic named Lutchumudu, who waking from a mental stupor, in which he had been since his admission, climbed a tree and fell from a great height dying shortly after. 17.

TRIENNIAL REPORT ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS. (a) Establishment charges.During the year 1902, the Superintendent and the Deputy Superintendent of the Madras Asylum were on privilege leave for one and three months, respectively, which necessitated the employment of a Commissioned Medical officer in place of the former find a temporary Civil Assistant Surgeon and a Civil Apothecary in place of the latter. This contributed largely to the increase of expenditure as compared with that of the two previous years. (b) Diet.The staple articles of diet, such as rice, ragi, etc., were cheaper during 1902 than in 1901, though they were dearer in both of these years than they were in 1900. (e) Book adjustments.The expenditure on additions and alterations to the asylum buildings undertaken by the Public Works Department in 1002, included in &quot;Book Charges,&quot; was markedly low during the triennium. (d) The variations under other items, being trivial, call for no remarks. (3) Gost per head.The cost per head during the triennium calculated on the daily average strength under the chief heads of expenditure stands thus : 1900. 1001. 1902.

The admissions in Madras alone were 77 in 1900, 59 in 1901 and 61 in 1902. The total amounts collected from paying patients during each year of the triennium were Rs. 12,605-15-9 in 1900, Rs. 15,461-9-5 in 1901 and Rs. 13,818-10-11 in 1902. (5) Manufacture* and gardening,During the past three rears the total credits were Rs. 13,294-5-11 in 1902, Rs. 13,013-5-1 in 1901. and Rs. 13,353-6-4 in 1900 : while the debits for the corresponding period amounted to Rs. 7,170-15-11, Rs. 6,720-9-1 and Rs. 6,080-7-11, resulting in a profit of Rs. 6,114-6-0, Rs. 6,297-12-0 and Rs. 7,272-14-5, respectively. The decrease in profit during the triennium was due to the failure of the vegetable crop in 1901 and to the diminished sale of manufactured goods in all the asylums during 1902. (a) Profit per head.In Madras during the year under review, out of a mean population of 403*48, 160*50 inmates were employed on remunerative labour, while in Vizagapatam and Calicut 19*04 and 24*97 out of 75 92 and 100*55 respectively were so engaged. The actual number of working days was 314, during which time the following amounts were earned : Rs. 4,809-2-9, Rs. 655-15-5 and Rs. 649-3-10, respectively, or Rs. 29-15-5, Rs. 34-6-5 and Rs. 26-0-0 per head calculated on the average number employed on manufactures as against Rs. &quot;.47-15-0, Rs. 35-10-0 and Rs. 44-11-11 in 1901 ; and Rs. 28-1-10, Rs. 31-13-6 and Rs. 51-8-11 in 1900, respectively. 19. Gmnehal Administration.The general administration of all the asylums was satisfactory. Captain C. B. Harrison, I.M.S., was in charge of the Madras Asylum throughout the year with the exception of a month, when Captain P. C. G-abbett, I.M.S., acted for him. Major W. C.

From Office of the Surgeon-General with the government of madras, Madras, 12th April 1905. No. 303. Surgeon-General W. R. BROWNE, m.d., I.M.S., Surgeon- General with the Government of Madras. The CHIEF SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Public Department. To Sir, I have the honour to submit, for the information of Government, the Annual Report on the Lunatic Asylums of the Madras Presidency for the year 1904 with brief notes thereon. 2. Statement No. IAsylum Population.This refers to the three asylums in the PresidencyMadras, Vizagapatam and Calicub. (a) There were 165 admissions or 5 less than last year into the three asylums and 27 of them were females, while against the 13 readmissions of the previous year there were only 6 in this year. The percentage of males and females to total admissions was 83*64 and 1636 respectively. (b) The admissions combined with those remaining from 1903 gave a population of 578 males and 174 females or a total of 752, exceeding the population of the preceding year by 8. The daily average number confined was 598*77 (450*86 males and 147-91 females) against 593-98 (442*85 males and 151*13 females) in 1903. (c) The maximum number confined at any one time in the year under report was 448 in Madras, 80 in Vizagapatam and 100 in Calicut with accommodation for 689, 96 and 147 inmates respectively. (d) The total discharges among all lunatics amounted to 110, of these 85 were cured, 15 transferred to friends and 10 discharged from the criminal list on expiration o' sentences passed upon them and shown as fresh admissions in civil. The number of deaths was 56, leaving in residence at the end of the year 586 (411 males and 145 females). The percentage of cures on daily average strength was 14*20 against 13*97, but in Madras it was 14*77 against 12*64 in 1903, in Vizagapatam 11*77 against 9*14 and in Calicut KV56 against *J2*65. The percentage of deaths on daily average strength was 9*35 as against 6*90 of the previous year. In the Madras Asylum it was 11*02 against 7*7S in the preceding year, in Vizagapatam 5'2o against 3 92 and in Calicut 5*21 against 5*66. The increase in the mortality in Madras was marked among the criminal lunatics, and the chief cause was tubercle of the lungs in both classes of inmates. 3. Statement No. II. In the above asylum population are included criminal lunatics who are confined only in the Madras Asylum; the number was, during the year, as follows : (a) There remained from the previous year 135 males and 18 females and there were admitted during the year 43 males and 4 females including 4 males who were readmitted, giving a total population of 178 males and 22 females or 200 in all. Of this number, 39 were discharged and 26 died leaving 135 at the end of the year. (b) The daily average strength was 150*06 as against 146*82 in the preceding year and the percentage of criminals to total population was 26*60 against 21*33 in the year previous. The percentage of mortality on the daily average strength was 17*33 against 4*09. This high rate of mortality among the criminal population was clue mainly to the fact that nearly half the number of deaths occurred among old inmates who had been in the asylum for long periods. 4. Statement No. III.Of the 165 admissions, 107 were returned as Hindus, 19 as Muhammadans, 19 as Native Christians, 16 as Europeans and Eurasians and

The proportion of females to males among Hindus was 1 to 9*7, among Muhammadans as 1 to 5*3, among Native Christians as 1 to 2'8 and among Europeans and Eurasians as 1 to 7. Of the total admissions Madras City contributed 38 Hindus and 8 Europeans and Eurasians, Malabar 6 Hindus and 6 Muhammadans and the remainder in small numbers from different parts of India. 5. Statements Nos. IV and V exhibit occupation and age of lunatics. There were 24 agricultural labourers, 23 coolies, 15 who had no occupation, and 34 whose occupations were not known. (a) The admissions by age as shown in Statement No. V were as follows : 107 between 20 to 40 years, 43 between 40 to 00, 1L were under 20 and 4 above 60 years. 6. Statements Nos. VI and VII.The numbers returned under the principal recognized forms of mental diseases were for mania 128, for epilepsy 13, for melancholia 8, for dementia 8, for delusional insanity 4, for idiocy 3, and 1 not diagnosed. Seventy-three cases or 44*24 per cent, of total admissions were assigned to specific causes as against 81 or 47&quot;65 per cent, in 1903. Of the known causes 24 were ascribed to moral causes and 49 to physical causes, such as epilepsy, ganja-smoking, heredity and spirit drinking, etc. 7. Escapes.There were no escapes from the two asylums in Madras and Calicut, but from Vizag-apatam where the grounds are unprotected by a wall and where there is a paucity of attendants, there were 8 escapes (6 males and 2 females); all were recaptured by the asylum attendants, 7 within a few hours and 1 after 4 days. 8. Medical(a) Sickness and its causes.The number of daily average siek of the three asylums during the year was 60*92 against 46*93 in 1903. The chief causes were tubercle of lungs, acute mania, epilepsy, catarrhal enteritis. (b) Mortality and Us causes.The total number of deaths was 56 as compared with 41 in 1903. At the Madras Asylum the mortality was high, being 47 against 3:2 in the year previous. It was chiefly due to the large number of deaths from tubercle of lungs and catarrhal enteritis. 9.

No. 332, Public, 9th May 1905. GOVERNMENT OF MADRAS. PUBLIC DEPARTMENT. Beadthe following paper : From the Surgeon-General W. R. BROWNE, m.d., I.M.8., Surgeon-General with the Government of Madras, to the Chief Secretary to Government, dated 12th April 1905, No 303. I have the honour to submit, for the information of Government, the Annual Report on the Lunatic Asylums of the Madras Presidency for the year 1904 with brief notes thereon. 2. Statement No. IAsylum Population.This refers to the three asylums in the PresidencyMadras, Vizagapatam and Calicut. {a) There were 165 admissions or 5 less than last year into the three asylums and 27 of them were females, while against the 13 readmissions of the previous year there were only 6 in this year. The percentage of males and females to total admissions was 83*64 and 16*36 respectively. (b) The admissions combined with those remaining from 1903 gave a population of 578 males and 174 females or a total of 752, exceeding the population of the preceding year by 8. The daily average number confined was 598*77 (450*86 males and 147*91 females) against 593*98 (442*85 males and 151*13 females) in 1903. (c) The maximum number confined at any one time in the year under report was 448 in Madras, 80 in Vizagapatam and 100 in Calicut with accommodation for 689, 96 and 147 inmates respectively. (d) The total discharges among all lunatics amounted to 110, of these 85 were cured, 15 transferred to friends and 10 discharged from the criminal list on expiration of sentences passed upon them and shown as fresh admissions in civil. The number of deaths was 56, leaving in residence at the 6nd of the year 586 (44d males and 145 femalos). The percentage of cures on daily average strength was 14*20 against 13*97, but in Madras it was 14*77 against 12*64 in 1903, in Vizagapatam 11*77 against 9*14 and in Calicut 13*56 against 22*65. The percentage of deaths on daily average strength was 9*35 as against 6*90 of the previous year. In the Madras Asylum it was 11*02 against 7*73 in the preceding year, in Vizagapatam 5*23 against 3*92 and in Calicut 5*21 against 5*66. The increase in the mortality in Madras was marked among the criminal lunatics, and the chief cause was tubercle of the lungs in both classes of inmates. 3. Statement No. II.In the above asylum population are included criminal lunatics who are confined only in the Madras Asylum; the number was, during the year, as follows : (a) There remained from the previous year 135 males and 18 females and there were admitted during the year 43 males and 4 females including 4 males who were readmitted, giving a total population of 178 males and 22 females or 200 in all. Of this number, 39 were discharged and 26 died leaving 135 at the end of the year. (b) The daily average strength was 150*06 as against 146*82 in the preceding year and the percentage of criminals to total population was 26*60 against 24*33 in the year previous. The percentage of mortality on the daily average strength was 17*33 against 4*09. This high rate of mortality among the criminal population was due mainly to the fact that nearly half the number of deaths occurred among old inmates who had been in the asylum for long periods. 4. Statement No. III.Of the 165 admissions, 107 were returned as Hindus, 19 as Muhammadans, 19 as Native Christians, 16 as Europeans and Eurasians and
No. 332, Public, 9th May 1905. 4 as other classes. The proportion of females to males among Hindus was 1 to 9*7, among Muhammadans as 1 to 5*3, among Native Christians as 1 to 2*8 and among Europeans and Eurasians as 1 to ?. Of the total admissions Madras City contributed 38 Hindus and 8 Europeans and Eurasians, Malabar 6 Hindus and 6 Muhammadans and the remainder in small numbers from different parts of India. 5. Statements Nos. IV&quot; and V exhibit occupation and age of lunatics. There were 24 agricultural labourers, 23 coolies, 15 who had no occupation, and 34 whose occupations were not known. (a) The admissions by age as shown in Statement No. V were as follows :. 107 between 20 to 40 years, 43 between 40 to CO, 11 were under 20 and 4 above 60 years. 6. Statements Nos. VI and VII.The numbers returned under the principal recognized forms of mental diseases were for mania 128, for epilepsy 13, for melancholia 8, for dementia 8, for delusional insanity 4, for idiocy 3, and 1 not diagnosed. Seventy-three cases or 44*24 per cent, of total admissions were assigned to specific causes as against 81 or 47*65 per cent, in 1903. Of the known causes 24 were ascribed to moral causes and 49 to physical causes, such as epilepsy, ganja-smoking, heredity and spirit drinking, etc. 7. Escapes.There were no escapes from the two asylums in Madras and Calicut, but from Vizagapatam where the ground* are unprotected by a wall and where there is a paucity of attendants, there were 8 escapes (6 males and 2 females); all were recaptured by the asylum attendants, 7 within a few hours and 1 after 4 days. 8. Medical(a) Sic/eness and its causes.The number of daily average sick of the three asylums during the year was 60*92 against 46*93 in 1903. The chief causes were tubercle of lungs, acute mania, epilepsy, catarrhal enteritis. (b) Mortality and its causes.The total number of deaths was 56 as compared with 41 in 1903. At the Madras Asylum the mortality was high, being 47 against 32 in the year previous. It was chiefly due to the large number of deaths from tubercle of lungs and catarrhal enteritis. 9.

Office of the Surgeon-General with the Government of Madras, Madras, 12th April 1907. No. 311. From Surgeon-General JV\ R. BROWNE, m.d., v.h.s., c.i.e., I.M.S., Surgeon-General with the Government of Madras. To The CHIEF SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Public Department. Sir, I have the honour to submit, for the information of Government, the annual report on the Lunatic Asylums of the Madras Presidency for the year 1906, with brief notes thereon. 2. Statement No. IAsylum Population.This deals with the three asylums in the PresidencyMadras, Calicut and Vizagapatam. (a) On the 1st January 1906, 579 lunatics were under treatment, of whom 428 were males and 151 females. There were 225 admissions during the year 166 males and 59 femaleswhich included 16 re-admissions12 males and 4 females. The admissions were 40 more than in 1905, and the large increase was due to the transfer of 36 lunatics from the asylum at Colombo to Madras. The total population of the asylums was thus 804 (594 males and 210 females) against 771 (584 males and 187 females) in the previous year. (J) There is the usual great preponderance of male to female inmates being in the proportion of nearly 3 to 1, while in English asylums the sexes furnish nearly equal numbers. The maximum number confined on any one day was 460 in Madras, 107 in Calicut and 85 in Vizagapatam, with accommodation for 689, 143 and 96, respectively. (c) Ninety-five inmates were discharged, of whom 69 were cured and of the 12 transferred to the care of friends, 11 had improved from their detention in the asylums. There were 72 deaths, leaving at the end of the year 637 inmates (470 males and 167 females). The percentage of cures on daily average strength in the three asylums together was 11*37 as compared with 11 07 of the previous year; but the percentage of cures to total admissions shows the much more favourable figure of 30*67 (approximating to the 36*79 for the asylums in England). 3. Statement No. II.This relates to criminal lunatics who are confined only in the Madras Asylum. (a) One hundred and twenty remained at the beginning of the year (107 males and 13 females), 33 were admitted (35 males and 3 females), and 3 were re-admitted, all of whom were males, making a total of 161 (L45 males and 10 females). Of these 22 were discharged, but 8 were merely transfers to the non-criminal side being still insane on the expiry of their sentences, and 9 died, leaving at the end of the year 116 males and 14 females or 130 in all.
4 ANNUAL REPORT ON THB LUNATIC ASYLUMS. (b) The daily average strength, 124*81 was much the same as last year, while the percentage of deaths on this strength was much less, 7*21 against 11*16. The mortality compared with recent years was low and the general health of these inmates verv good. 4. Statement No III gives the religion, sex and residence of those admitted. Of the 225 admissions, there were 134 Hindus, 27 Muhammadans, 22 Native Christians, 31 Europeans and Eurasians and 11 of other classes. As usual, Madras contributed the largest share of the admissions and this year the batch returned from. Ceylon made up a noticeable figure. 5. Statements Nos. IV and V show the occupations and ages of the admissions. There were 26 agricultural labourers, 42 coolies, ministerial and menial servants 13 each, 16 beggars, 18 were of no occupation and in 26 their occupation was unknown. The remainder in small numbers belonged to various occupations. With regard to ages 17 were under 20 years on admission, 146 were from between 20 to 40 years, 52 between 40 to 60 years and 10 above 60 years. 6. Statements Nos. VI and VII.The numbers admitted for the chief recognized forms of mental diseases were for mania 134 (including 6 epileptics), for dementia 50 (including 5 epileptics), for melancholia 31 (including 2 epileptics), for idiocy 5, for delusional insanity 4 and for mental stupor 1. Specific causes were assigned in 106 cases, i.e., in 47*11 per cent, comparing favourably with the 39*46 per cent, of the previous year. Of the known causes, 81 were ascribed to physical causes such ps epilepsy, spirit-drinking, ganja-smoking, heredity, etc., and 25 to moral causes ; but the * unknown' cause still figures too largely in the returnsfrom the difficulty, of course, of obtaining an accurate history of the individual patients. 7. Escapes.There were no escapes from the asylums in Madras and Calicut, but from that at Vizagapatam, 5 males and 1 female escaped from the grounds while at work, 4 of whom were captured in a few hours, while the other (a male) is still at large. 8. Medical(a) Sickness and its causes.The average daily sick in the three asylums was 41*66 against 62*89 in the previous year. The general health of the patients was good. As usual, the largest number of admissions to hospital was for catarrhal enteritis and its allies, diarrhoea and dysentery; next came acute mania and tubercle of the lungs.- (6) Mortality and its causes.Seventy-two deaths occurred in the three asylums against 86 in 1905. The percentage mortality on daily average strength was 11*87 against 14*64 of the previous year, so that the figure for the asylums of all England of 10*03 is fairly approximate to ours despite the difference in the causes of the mortality in the two countries, for the general paralysis of the insane that is almost unknown in India causes 20 per cent, or more of the deaths in asylums in England, while with us tuberculosis is by far the most important cause of death, and next come bowel affections closely followed by acute mania. 9. Epidemics.There were no epidemics in any of the asylums, but two cases of cholera occurred among the first batch of lunatics transferred from Colombo to Madras, one of whom died. The precautions taken sufficed to prevent a spread of the disease. 10. Statement No. VIII.A reference to the financial statement shows a decrease in expenditure of lls. 5,575-11-9. This decrease was in spite of the higher rate of pay drawn for part of the year by the Superintendent of the Madras Asylum and the increased charges on diet owing to larger numbers treated and enhanced rates of provisions, and is clue chiefly to smaller expenditure on buildings and their repairs, smaller salary drawn by the Military Assistant Surgeon in the Madras Asylum, smaller cost of bedding and clothing, and to the greater amount realized from paying patients (Rs. 1,121 more). 11. Diet.The average cost of the diets is shown to be much the same as in former years, though market prices ruled somewhat higher and I am inclined to think that a more liberal * table ' might sometimes be advantageously given.
ANNUAL REPORT ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 5 12. Cost per head.The total cost per head during the year calculated on the daily average strength under the chief heads of expenditure in the three asylums was Rs. 161-13-10 against Rs. 160-3-6 in the previous year. 13. Statement No. XManufactures and gardening.Under this heading a decrease in receipts of Rs, 2,095-8-6 is shown clue to the comparative failure of garden crops during the year. 14. Profits on Manufactures.This varies considerably in the three asylums : thus in Madras where 152*53 inmates out of a population of 426*70 were daily employed a profit of Rs. 25 per head is shown; in Calicut 22*29 out of 100*47 earned Rs. 45 per head, and in Waltair 11*65 employed on the average every day out of the 79*46 inmates earned as much as Rs. 77 each. The reason for the variation is explained by the Superintendents as being due in the smaller asylums to the large profits per head derived from weaving and the sale of garden produce at Vizagapatam and the very profitable goat-rearing that was in vogue at Calicut: on the other hand, much unprofitable labour has to be employed in the large asylum at Madras in keeping the grounds presentable though the labour is shown under the heading of remunerative labour, i.e., gardening, and thus the profit per head is necessarily lessened. 15. General Remarks.(a) The inmates of the asylums had their periodical treats and amusements as usual; Government has sanctioned the purchase of a gramaphone for the asylum at Vizagapatam. The Central Christmas Charity fund gave Rs. 20 and the Manager of the Madras Mail his paper free to the Madras asylum. (b) The inventory of the valuable stock of the three asylums has been maintained and verified. (c) The service books of the establishment of the three asylums have been verified. (d) The asylums at Madras and Calicut were inspected by Surgeon-General P. H. Benson and those at Madras and Vizagapatam by me during the year. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, W.R.BROWNE, m.d., I.M.S., Surgeon-General, Surgeon-General with the Government of Madras.

No. 372, Public, 16th Mat 1.907. GOVERNMENT OF MADRAS. PUBLIC DEPARTMENT Readthe following paper: Letterfrom Surgeon-General W. R. Browne, m.d., v.h.s., c.i.e., I.M.S., Surgeon-General with the Government of M adras. Tothe Chief Secretary to Government. DatedMadras, the 12th April 1907. No.311. Abstract.Submitting report on the Lunatic Asylums for the year 1906. OrderNo. 372, Public, dated 16th May 1907. * Recorded. 2. With reference to the suggestion in paragraph 11 of the report that a more liberal table might sometimes be given, the Surgeon-General is requested to submit a full report on the subject. It is observed that the expenditure per head on diet was nearly twice as high at Calicut as it was *Rs. 54-14-9 against Rs. 29-2-10. at Waltair * last year. At Madras it tRs. 78-9-8 against Rs. 54-14-9. was. aSain considerably higher than at Calicut f. But the larger number of European and Eurasian patients and the greater cost of provisions at Madras would perhaps sufficiently account for the difference in the cost of dieting patients at Madras and at Calicut. 3. The prescribed scales of diet being the same for the three Asylums, it appears strange that the cost of dieting patients should be so much lower at Waltair than at Madras or Calicut. The Surgeon-General is requested to ascertain and explain the cause of this. Detailed statistics tor the last few years should be submitted if they are available. (True Extraot.) H. Bbadley, Ag. Chief Secretary.

From Office of the Subgeon-General with the Government of Madras, Madras, 26/7/. March 1908. No. 97/253. Surgeon-General W\ R. BROWNE, m.d., v.h.s., c.i.e., I.M.S., Surgeon-General with the Government of Madras, The CHIEF SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Public Department. To Sib, I have the honour to submit for the information of Government the annual report on the three Lunatic Asylums of the Madras Presidency for the year 1907, with brief notes thereon. 2. Statement No. IAsylum Population.This statement shows the admissions, discharges, etc , of lunatics in the asylums in the Madras PresidencyMadras, Calicut and Vizagapatam. * (a) On the 1st January 1907, 637 lunatics were under treatment, of whom 470 were males and 167 females. There were 180 admissions during the year (125 males and 55 females), of whom there were 22 re-admissions (16 males and 6 females). The admissions were 45 less than in 1906 ; and the large increase in 1906 was due to the transfer of 36 lunatics from the asylum at Colombo to Madras. The total population of the asylums was 817 (595 males and 222 females) against 804 (594 males and 2L0 females) in the preceding year. (b) There is as usual great preponderance of male over female inmates, in the proportion of about 3 to 1, this year. The maximum number confined on any one day was 473 in Madras, 109 in Calicut and 79 in Vizagapatam, with accommodation for 689, 143 and 96, respectively. (c) Discharged : Cured 66. Improved 12. Not improved and discharged otherwise 20. Died, 103 (77 males and 26 females), leaving at tho end of the year 610 inmates. The percentage of cures on daily average strength in the three asylums together was 10*45 against 11*37 of the previous year ; but the percentage of cures to total admissions was 36*67 a more favourable result than last year, when it was 30*67. 3. Statement No. IT.This deals with criminal lunatics who are confined in the Madras Asylum only. (a) One hundred and thirty remained at the beginning of the year (116 males and 14 females), 33 were admitted (29 males and 4 females), and 0 were re-admitted (5 males and 1 female), making a total of 169 (150 males and 19 females). Of these 20 (15 males and 5 females) were discharged,-and 13 males died, leaving at the close of the year 136 in all (122 males and 14 females). (b) The daily average strength (118*90 males and 13*43 females) was 132-33 as against 124*61 in the previous year, while the percentage of deaths was 9*82 for 1907 against 7*21 for 1906. The mortality compared with tho previous year was rather high, 13 against 9. 4. Statement No III gives the religion, sex and residence of patients admitted into the asylums for 1907. Of 180 admissions, there were 98 Hindus, 19 Muham-madans, 14 Native Christians, 33 Europeans and Eurasians and 16 of other classes. 5. Statements Nos. IV and V.These show the previous occupations of patients and ages of admissions into the asylums. There were 24 agricultural
4 ANNUAL REPORT OX TTIE LUNATIC ASYLUMS. labourers including cultivators, 23 carriers, 6 beggars, 26 without occupation and 19 whose occupation was unknown, the remainder in small numbers belonging to various occupations. This shows that the majority of cases were admitted for causes other than mental overstrain. With regard to ages 19 were under 20 years on admission, .120 were from 20 to 40 years, 38 from 40 to 60 years, and 3 above 60 years. 6. Statements Nos. VI and VII.The numbers admitted for the chief recognized forms of mental diseases were for mania 126 (6 epileptics included), dementia 26 (4 epileptics included), melancholia IS, idiocy 5, mental stupor 2, and declared to have recovered, but not yet diagnosed 2. Specific causes were assigned in 97 cases, i.e., 53*89 as compared with 47*11 per cent, of the previous year. Of the known causes, 74 were ascribed to physical causes as epilepsy, ganja-smoking, spirit-drinking, heredity or congenital, fever and other physical causes and 23 to moral causes. The number under &quot; unknown cause &quot; was Sofrom the difficulty, of course, of obtaining a proper history of the individual patients. 7. Escapes.There were 2 escapes during the year in the Madras Asylum, one civil male, who was captured the following daythe other a civil female, a transfer from Rangoon, who has not been caught. No escapes at Calicut1 male-escaped at Vizagapatam, but was captured immediately. 8. Medical(a) Sickness and Us causes.The average daily sick in the three asylums was 56*69 against 41*66 in the previous year. The general health of the patients of the asylums was fairly good. As usual, the largest number of admissions to hospital was for catarrhal enteritis, diarrhoea and dysentery, fever, tubercle of the lungs, mania, and other causes. (b) Mortality and its causes.One hundred and three deaths occurred in the three asylums against seventy-two deaths in the previous year. The percentage mortality on daily average strength was 16*30 against 11*87 of the previous year. (c) Tuberculosis is by far the most important cause of death. In Madras Asylum alone there were 20 that succumbed to this disease. 9. EpidemicsPrevailed only in the Madras Asylumcholera made its appearance on the 11th September 1907 with 17 attacks and 14 deaths. The first three cases occurred among the Europeans and Eurasians in the so-called &quot; Soldier's Blocks &quot;the infection could not be traced definitely ; then it broke out among the hospital inmates on the 3rd October 1907, when it took an epidemic form probably infection was carried by fliesas, in spite of rigid precautions taken in regard to disinfecting discharges, clothes and buildings, the cases continued to occur first in one part of the asylum and then in another. Ohicken-pov,A few cases of a very mild type prevailed in the Madras Asylum only. 10. Statement VIII.The Financial statement shows an increase in expenditure of Rs. 29,003-0-8 during 1907 as compared with 1906. This is due to increased expenditure in the Madras Asylum amounting to Rs. 27,571-15-1, Calicut Rs. 686-12-4 and Vizagapatam Rs. 744-5-3. In the Madras Asylum, the increase is largely due to the construction of certain quarters of the staff and repairs executed by the Public Works Department; to the additional menial staff employed on account of increased population ; to the higher rate of pay drawn by the Superintendent and to some extent to the higher rate paid for food-grains; and to increase in the water-tax paid to the Corporation of Madras. In Calicutthe increase is due to the purchase of more European drugs during the year and also to enhanced cost of provisions. In Vi/ACiAPATAMthe increase is due to the posting of a second-grade Hospital Assistant in lieu of a third-grade one, to the purchase of asylum requisites, and to the construction of a cat tleshed and a water-reservoir. 11. Diets.- -The total expenditure on diets during the year excluding book adjustments is Rs. 47,718-0-11 as compared with Rs. 41,376-5-8 in the preceding yearan increase of Rs. 0,341-11-3 due to the rise in prices of foodstuffs, and also-to an increased number of inmates.
ANNUAL REPORT ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 5 12. Cost per head.The total expenditure on diet in the Madras Asylum is Rs. 40,442-9-3 (including book charges Rs. 1,351-5-2 for diet articles received from the Jail, Salt and other departments) and the average cost per head for the year amounts to Rs. 88-4-9 as compared with Rs. 78-9-8 in 1906. In Calicut the total expenditure on diet was Rs. 5,623-6-0 and the average cost per head was Rs. 56-11-9 as compared with Rs. 54-14-9 in 1906. In Vizagapatam, the total expenditure, including book adjustments on diet, Rs. 202-8-0, was Rs. 3,205-14-10, and the average cost per head is Rs. 42-14-2 as compared with Rs. 34-7-4 in 1906. The average cost of diet per diem per head differs in the three asylums according to the nature of diets issued. In Madras an European diet costs 6 annas 5 pies per diem, for natives 2 annas 10 pies. In Vizagapatam an ordinary native diet costs 1 anna 10 pies, in Calicut 2 annas 4 pies. 13. Statement No. XManufactures and gardening.In Madras the total amount realized under this head during the year 1007 excluding sale of rice tour, etc., was Rs. 2,047-4-5 against Rs. 1,879-9-10, or an increase of Rs. 167-10-7 as compared with the previous year. This is mainly due to the favourable mango crop, which was a thorough failure in 1906. In Vizagapatam the net profit on manufactured articles was Rs. 716-13-8 against Rs. 907-1-6 of the previous year. The decrease is due to less demand of manufactured articles from out hospitals. The sale of garden produce realized Rs. 320-12-8 against Rs. 358-6-10 last year. In Calicut the total profit was Rs. 856-14-3 against Rs. 1,005-11-8 in the previous year. The decrease in the profits is accounted for by the fact that the services of the lunatics were not employed for repairs, etc., to the asylum buildings by the contractor. 14. ^Profits on Manufactures.This item differs considerably in the three asylums. For instance in Madras 170*88 inmates out of a daily average population of '&#9632;! 58*03 were employed and realized a profit of Rs. 29-0-10 per head. In Calicut 20*01 inmates out of a population of 99*12 earned Rs. 42-14-9 each. In Vizagapatam 11*99 out of a mean population of 74*73 cleared a profit of Rs. 59-11-6 per head. 15. General Remarks.(a) The inmates of the three asylums had their periodical treats and amusements as usual. A gramophone sanctioned last year by the Government for Vizagapatam Asylum was purchased this year. The Central Christmas Charity fund contributed Rs. 25 this year to the Madras Asylum and paid for the pudding for the inmates on Christmas day. The Manager of the Madras Mail supplied his paper free to the Madras Asylum. The Illustrated London News, Chamber's Journal and the Madras Times are provided for the use of patients by Government. The asylum possesses a library also from which books and periodicals are supplied to the patients. Several native gentlemen also have extended their liberality to the inmates and contributed towards the treat, etc. (b) The inventory of the valuable stock of the three asylums has been maintained and verified. (c) The service books of the establishment of the three asylums have been verified. His Excellency the Governor visited the Calicut and Vizagapatam Asylums during the year, and all the asylums \vexie inspected by me. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, W. R. BROWNE, m.u., c.i.e., Surgeon-General, I.M.S., Surgeon-Qeneral with the Government of Madras.

From Office of the Surgeon-General with the Government of Madras, Madras, 29th March 1909. No. 63/292. Surgeon-General P. H. BENSON, m.b., v.3.8., I.M.S., Surgeon-General with the Government of Madras, To The CHIEF SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Public Department. Sir, I have the honour to submit, for the information of Government, my report on the Lunatic Asylums in the Madras Presidency for the triennium ending 1908. 2. Asylum population and accommodationPopulation.Inclusive of criminals the inmates numbered 579 at the beginning of 1906, over 71 per cent, being lodged in the Madras Asylum. Admissions and re-admissions totalled 225, 180 and 225 in the three years under report; of these the transfers from the Lunatic Asylum, Colombo, to that of Madras in 1906 and 1908 numbered 36 and 20 respectively, leaving 574 to be accounted for locally. The total admitted for the preceding triennium was 520, and the increase appears to be due to a better appreciation of asylum care and the ease of transport now more readily available. Of the total treated there were discharged cured 219 (18*1 per cent.), improved 46 (3*8 per cent.) and otherwise 57 (4*7 per cent.), while deaths numbered 233 (19-27 per cent.); the percentages for the previous triennium under these results were 21*3, 5*6, 3*5 and 16*73 respectively; the variations being markedly in contrast owing to 14 deaths from cholera in 1907 at Madras, and the high death-rate at the same place among the weak and debilitated patients transferred from Colombo. The daily average strength of the asylums was 625*14 as compared with 593*38 of the last report, the proportion of female to male inmates being 1 to 2*8 and 2*9 respectively. 8. Ages.The ordinary age for admission appears to occur between 20 and 40 years, the numbers recorded for that term of life forming 65*4 per cent, of the total in the period under report, and 64*2 per cent, in the last preceding triennium. From 40 to 60 years is the next most common period, the percentages recorded being 23*8 and 24*6 respectively. 4. Religions, races and castes.There were admitted 103 Europeans and Eurasians, 56 Native Christians, 355 Hindus, 78 Muhammadans and 38 of other castes, the proportions being 16*35, 8*89, 56*35, 12*38 and 603 per cent, respectively. In the previous triennium the percentage was 12*50, 11*35, 58*85, 12*88 and 4*42 respectively. Admissions among the first group, which averaged 22 per annum in the past, numbered 31, 33 and 39 in the three years under report; the same average was noted among Muhammadans before, but admissions among them averaged 26 for the past three years. The differences in the Native Christians and other castes indicate the additional care exercised in registering the former as they occur among the lower classes. 5. Sexes.The percentage of females admitted was for Europeans and Eurasians, 50*49; for Native Christians, 51*78; for Hindus, 16*91 ; for Muhammadans, 11*54; and for other castes, 34*20. Those figures show a fall among Muhammadans of 1*9 per cent., due to the increased number of male admissions; and a marked rise of 168 per cent, among other castes, strictly due to an increased number of females.
REPORT ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 6. Occupations.Of 467 males admitted during the three years 49 (10-5 per cent.) were returned as of ' uncertain ' and 25 (5*3 per cent.) as of &#9632; no * occupation ; of the latter group 11 were students. Among occupations, agriculture contributed 75 (16 per cent.) and general labour 70 (15 per cent.), while 31 (6*6 per cent.) had been engaged in trade, 24 (51 per cent.) were domestic servants, and 21 (4*5 per cent.) were professed mendicants. In the preceding triennium 60 (146 per cent.) were described as of ' uncertain' and 31 (7*5 per cent.) as of * no' occupation, including 5 students ; while for the occupations particularised above the corresponding percentages were 15*1, 15'3, 7*0, 4*6 and 24 respectively. 7. Of 163 females admitted 20 (12*2 per cent.) were described as of uncertain pursuit, and 58 (356 per cent.), including 3 students, had no occupation. Domestic servants numbered 28 (17*1 per cent.), general labourers 25 (15*3 per cent.) and mendicants 8 (49 per cent.). The corresponding percentages of the previous period were 192, 275, 16*5, 15-6 and 7*3 respectively. It will be noticed that among males more effort has been made to secure information as to previous occupation, while among females those of no recognised occupation are better tabulated as such than included in the * uncertain ' column. 8. Previous residence.European and Eurasian admissions had resided in Madras City (35), Ohingleput district (8), Nilgiris (9), Rangoon (4), Bangalore (7) and Malabar district (12). Of Native Christians 6 arrived from Colombo, 13 were admitted from Madras and 14 in the Malabar district. Hindus numbered 79 from Madras, 48 from Malabar district, 34 from Colombo, 24 from Vizagapatam, 15 from South Canara, 14 from Tanjore, and 12 each from Madura and Salem districts. Among Muhammadans 28 (36 per cent.) were of Malabar and 16 (20 per cent.) were of Madras ; 6 arrived from Colombo and 5 belonged to South Canara. Of the total, Madras contributed 25*49 per cent., Malabar 1619, Colombo 9*22 and Yizagapatam 4*60 ; excluding Colombowhich did not appear in the previous reportthe other localities named furnished respectively 277, 17*7 and 6*05 per cent, of the admissions in contrast with 32*3, 13*5 and 308 per cent respectively in the previous triennium. 9. Types of insanity.Cases of &quot; general paralysis of the insane &quot; did not occur at any asylum ; &quot; mental stupors were observed at Madras only. Mamat dementia and melancholia are the common types in order of frequency, and furnished 63*52, 18*86 and 9*43 percent, of the total treated; while the proportion of females to males under these headings was as 1 to 3*1, 2*1 and 3*7 per cent, respectively. Under these types the cases attributable to epilepsy numbered 50, 1(5 and 3 (equivalent to 6*5, 7*0 and 2*6 per cent.) in each class respectively Idiocy furnished 43 cases and delusional insanity 39, forming 3*56 and 3*22 per cent, of the total. In the last named types the numbers vary but little from the usual average ; in those described as the common types the percentages for the previous triennium were respectively 72*21, 13*62 and 731, the variation being due to the influx of chronic cases from Colombo. The results of treatment under the common types was recorded as recovery in 23, 2*2 and 27*19 per cent, respectively ; improvement in 4*16, 3*5 and 2*63 per cent, respectively ; and death in 19, 27*2 and 14 per cent, respectively. One case of idiocy was discharged improved, and 8 died; of delusional insanity 4 cases recovered and 2 were discharged improved. The mortality at Madras Asylum accounts for the difference from the usual average of results. 10. Causes of insanity.Fifty per cent, of the total number treated were of undefined or unknown cause, and only one-fourth of these cases were females. Of the remaining 604 cases moral causes accounted for 148 (24*5 per cent.), the proportion of females being 1 to 1*74 males. Of known physical causes, among 456 inmates, ganja-smoking accounted for 69 males and 1 female; spirit-drinking for 28 males ; hereditary and congenital causes for 64 males and 23 females; epilepsy for 52 males and 19 females ; opium, and intoxicants not specified, for 17 males; and fever for 17 males and 2 females ; while 97 males and 67 females were under treatment for insanity the result of physical causes not tabulated. In the previous triennium cases due to spirit-drinking numbered 13, while epilepsy had given rise to 5h cases ; under other headings the numbers were almost the same as above. The results of treatment among cases of unknown origin were that 91
REPORT ON THE. LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 5 (15 per cent.) recovered, IS (3 per cent.) were discharged improved and 124 (20'5 per cent.) died; in comparison with the previous term the good results were more appreciable among males, and the death-rate was 9 per cent, higher among females. Cases of moral causation recovered in 35 instances (236 per cent.), improved in 9. others (6*08 per cent.) and terminated fatally in 25 cases (IT percent.) ; the female percentage was higher for good and ill alike. Among the known physical causes recovery resulted in 18 ('257 per cent.) cases of ganja-smoking and 6 (21*4 per cent.) cases of spirit-drinking; L and 5 respectively were discharged improved ; and the deaths numbered 13 and 8 ; in these the male population only was affected. In the cases arising from hereditary and congenital causes 29*7 per cent, of males and 17'4 per cent, of females recovered; 4 per cent, of either sex improved appreciably, and the death-rate was 14*1 per cent, among males and 34 per cent, among females. Of the cases due to epilepsy recovery resulted among 9*6 per cent, of males and 5'3 per cent, of females, improvement was noted in 10*5 per cent, of females only; and the death-rate was 29 per cent, of males and 10*5 per cent, of females. 11. Criminal population.These are housed at the Madras Asylum alone, admissions to the other asylums being but temporary to allow of necessary legal arrangements for transfer. Of this class there remained, at the end of 1905, 120, comprising 107 males and 13 females ; there were admitted 38 males and 3 females in 1906; 34 males and 5 females in 1907; and 46 males and 2 females in 1908, Of these admissions, 26 had been tried and acquitted ; 63 were incapable of making a defence ; and 34 became insane during imprisonment. The corresponding figures for the previous triennium were &quot;25, 40 and 48 respectively The type of insanity at the time of admission was mania in 87 (68*0 per cent.), dementia in 15 (11'7 per cent.) and melancholia in 17 (133 per cent.), while in one case of 1907, admitted by order of the High Court, there was no appreciable disease. Of these criminals 13 were discharged recovered, and 24 others in like condition were discharged to stand their trial; 4 had improved, and were let out on bond ; of transfers, 6 were sent to the Penitentiary for further observation, 19 were put on the ordinary list as being insane after expiration of their term of imprisonment, and 1 was transferred to another province. Tha criminal with no appreciable disease was discharged ' otherwise'. One male escaped at the close of 1908, while under treatment in the hospital enclosure; he has been captured at Tiruvadamarudiir (Kumbakonam taluk) and remanded to jail. The death-rate per cent, was 5*59, 7*69 and 6*82 for the three years respectively, or an average of 6'6 for the whole period, which contrasts favourably with 8&quot;2rf per cent, in the preceding triennium. In 37-5 per cent, of the criminal admissions was insanity assigned to known causes, a record less by 0*5 than that previously recorded; but whereas moral causes accounted for 12 out of 43 cases in the last triennium, in the present term only 3 out of 48 were so assigned. Cases due to intoxicants numbered S as contrasted with 5 in the past; and heredity, fevers and epilepsy yielded 9, 6 and 11 cases, the corresponding previous numbers being 7, 3 and 7. The daily average strength of this population was 124-81, 132-33 and 143*07 for the three years respectively; the mean being 13340 or ~i *30 less than the previous one, and the females alone averaged 13*45 or &lt;5'6 less. The criminals in the term under report formed 20 5 per cent, of the total treated in the presidency and 27'5 of the Madras Asylum population ; for the previous triennium these percentages were 23*5 and 32*1 respectively. 12. Accommodation.fn the Madras Asylum 8 beds in the male hospital and 6 beds in the female enclosure, heretofore included under native ' accommodation, have been set apart for the European sick; when to these are added the new constructions of 1903 (infra) there is now accommodation for 89 European males and 63 females, and for 460 native males and 84 females, which is 696 in all. The Vizagapatam Asylum can accommodate 79 native males and 17 females; and of the same class the Calicut Asylum can accommodate 107 males and 86 females. At no time was there any over-crowding among the males ; but an increase in female accommodation is necessary, and is being attended to in Madras and Calicut. The highest number contined at any one time was, (1) 365 males and 132 females, at Madras, on the 19th December 1D0S; (2) 68 males and 17 females, at Vizagapatam,. 2
REPORT ON THE LUNATIC! ASYLUMS. on the 30th May 1906 ; and (3) 73 males and 36 females, at Calicut, on the 31sfc December 1907. A deficiency of lavatory accommodation in parts and of single-room accommodation in the Native Civil male section of the Madras Asylum have already been put before Government for consideration. Vi. New construction*.At the Madras Asylum, in 1906, drains were constructed in the Native Civil male section ; in 1907, more drains were constructed in the male hospital and the female enclosure; quarters to complete the accommodation for six European attendants, a kitchen in the male hospital, a storeroom in the criminal enclosure and a latrine for the Civil Apothecary's quarters were also built, and telephonic communication with other offices was established; in 1908, ceilings were fitted to the roofs of cottages in the criminal enclosure, certain store-rooms in the female enclosure were converted into suitable single rooms for patients, certain minor works of construction and repair were completed, and the construction of two blocks comprising respectively 16 and 4 single rooms for females was commenced. At Vizagapatam were constructed in 1906, a cottage for caste inmates, a weaving house, aud a store-room for grain; in 1907, a cattle-shed and a reservoir for water; and in 1908, a latrine for the Hospital Assistant's quarters. At Calicut new works comprised in 1906, three detached servants' huts; in 1907, a servants' latrine and a well; and in 1908, another latrine for servants, a godown for storing fire-wood and a shed for goats. 14. Repairs.The usual general repairs were annually carried out in each asylum, and the institutions are in satisfactory condition. 15. Hospital accommodation exists at Madras for 92 males and 20 females; at Vizagapatam for 17 males only, the female sick being treated in the general ward, pending construction of a separate ward; and at Calicut for 9 males and 6 females, the new female hospital being under construction. The average daily sick for the triennium was 46*35 at Madras, 2*29 at Vizagapatam and 4'42 at Calicut respectively, and did not strain the accommodation. 16. SanitationConservancy.The dry earth system is in use at all three asylums and works satisfactorily, the excreta being buried in trenches and used as manure. But at the Madras Asylum the trenches are dug within the walls of the institution at a short distance from the European attendants' quarters ; land might advantageously be acquired beyond the wallseven if in close proximity theretofor storing this manure as it is formed. 17. General hygiene.Special attention has been paid to the free ventilation and thorough cleansing of asylum buildings, the bedding and clothing of the inmates, and the disinfection of soiled linen as necessary. 18. hrainage.The drainage is natural in all three asylums. At Vizagapatam and Calicut it is satisfactory. At Madras the drainage is variously distributed, and has been the subject of complaint by the Municipality; the Municipal Health Officer and the Divisional Executive Engineer have considered the means of remedy, and the latter officer is preparing plans to connect existing drains and to lead the drainage to a septic tank in the south-east corner of the compound, from which the effluent would be led to clinker filter beds on a piece of ground outside the asylum, from where the purified effluent could be conducted into the Otari nullah which is the natural channel of drainage for the locality. 19. Water &quot;Supply.At Vizagapatam the well in the asylum compound, though deepened in 1908, fails to satisfy requirements ; water is carted in from a well at some distance; and I have instructed the Superintendent to devise some scheme by which the water may be pumped in. A similar scheme must also be devised for the Calicut Asylum where the wells generally dry up in the hot season, and the position of the site gives no promise of fresh springs even at considerable depth. For the Madras Asylum, in view of the completion of the water-supply scheme for the city generally, the Government decided (G-.O., No. 181, Public, dated 6th March 1907) to postpone consideration of any special proposal. The pipe-supply as already established continues to be used for all purposes except gardening; and in 1907 the pipes were thoroughly cleaned and put in order.
I?EPORT ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 20. MiscellaneousB'ood and weighments.The food supplies have been good throughout. Rice is the staple grain, and is supplemented by ragi at Madras; cholum was in use at Vizagapatara up to July 1908, and was discontinued as offering no advantage in price or sustaining power. Fortnightly weighments have been regularly made and the results were satisfactory. 21. The supply of clothing continues as heretofore and i3 varied according to climatic needs and the health state of the inmates. 22. Industries and employments.The insanes are employed in grass-farming and gardening generally, sheep-breeding at Vizagapatam, and the upkeep of a dairy at Calicut. Men who show some knowledge of the crafts are persuaded to assist the artisans employed in asylum work and repairs ; while others are regularly engaged in spinning and weaving cotton goods, sewing and knitting, tape and rope making, grinding food-grains, and light house-hold work. No compulsion is used in this connection; but work is rewarded by gifts of fruit, tobacco, etc. 23. Amusements.These have been well attended to. In-door and out-door games are regularly arranged. The library at Madras is contributed to by the Superintendent and staff, supported bjr Government, and helped by certain newspaper proprietors. On festival occasions treats have been provided for the insanes , to these have contributed at Madras, His Highness the Maharaja of Mysore and the Central Christian Charity Fund ; at Vizagapatam, Sri Maharani Lady Gajapathi Row Garu ; and at Calicut, the Eralpad Raja of Calicut. Music has been provided at Madras in the gift of a gramophone by Mrs. Frost of the Castle Hotel, Mount Road ; and at Vizagapatam in the purchase of a similar instrument; as well as in the engagement of local bands when occasion offered. 24. Statistics of health and treatment of the sickSickness and its causes.The average daily sick in the three asylums together was 41-66, 56*69 and 60*83 in the three years respectively. The mean for the triennium was 5306 and contrasts favourably with the last record of 56*91. The principal diseases treated were, in order of frequencybowel affections, including dysentery and diarrhoea; nerve ailments, including acute mania; conditions of anaemia and general debility, tubercular and other general diseases. 25. Forcible feeding and methods in use.This is rarely necessary at Vizagapatam and Calicut. At Madras it is a recognised necessity and is resorted to on an average in the case of 17 inmates in each year. The method in use is nasal feeding by means of a Jacques catheter and syphon tubing. 26. Mortality and its causes.The deaths numbered 72, 103 and 58 in the three years, yielding an average of 77'67 as contrasted with 61 in the previous triennium. Excluding the deaths that resulted from cholera at Madras in 1907, and among the weak and debilitated arrivals from Colombo, the chief causes of mortality were:(a) tubercle, the percentage contributed by this having fallen to 17 iu 190S in lieu of the 31 and 28 of the preceding years; (b) diseases of the nervous system, including acute mania; (c) dysentery and catarrhal inflammation of the bowels ; and ((/) pneumonia and diseases of the lungs. 27. Epidemics and how they were dealt with.In 1907 an epidemic of cholera occurred in the Madras Asylum. There were 17 attacks and 14 deaths. An European male was first attacked on the 11th September; 4 cases occurred sporadically up to the 3rd October, on which day there were 5 attacks, and 7 more cases occurred in the course of the next four days. All these attacks, after the first, were among the civil native males, living in various blocks, and having in common the one item of rice food. Those on ragi diet were not affected. Major R. Bryson, I.M.S., then in charge, attributes the conveyance of infection to flies which swarmed considerably at the time. All cases of diarrhoea were segregated, and those developing symptoms of cholera were removed to the contagious sheds; a special staff of attendants was engaged, the cooked food was kept carefully covered until the time of distribution, and water for drinking purposes was boiled and clarified with permanganate of potash, in the previous triennium (August 1905) there had been 19 attacks with 12 deaths, solely attributable to contamination of water-supply.
&#9632;8 REPOKT ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 28. Injuries received.Of severe injuries there were recorded in the Madras Asylum 5 in 1906 and 7 in 1907. Of the latter group one proved fatal, death being from ' shock ' the result of multiple injuries, presumably inflicted by another but without evidence to fix the guilt. The other occupants of the room in which the death occurred were quiet and unaggressive; they were not sufficiently intelligent to explain the mystery, and the night watchman, who made his rounds ten minutes previously, had observed nothing unusual. 29. Hospital diets and extras.These were sufficient and satisfactory. In Madras the average cost of the European patient's diet was 7\ annas in 1906, and 1\- annas in 1907, but rose to 9^ annas in 1908 ; that of the native patient's diet was 4f annas in 1906 and 4 annas m 1007, with a rise to 5| annas in 1908. The increase was brought about by the steady rise in the daily average of sick inmates and the enhanced cost of diet supplies. In Vizagapatam the cost of the native patient's diet averaged 2^, 2&plusmn;% and 3T^ annas in the three years; an increased need for issue of milk diets for debilitated cases accounts for the rise. In Calicut the cost of the same averaged from 3f to 3T5y annas, a very slight variation. The mean of these different averages for the triennium under report yields 8 annas, 5T3^ annas, 2| annas, and 3T72- annas; those for the preceding term gave 71, 4|, 2\% and 34 respectively. 30. The nursing of the sick has been efficiently carried out by skilled attendants in the Madras and Vizagapatam Asylums. The want of trained nurses is much felt at the Calicut Asylum ; and the question of recommending an increase to the staff is under my consideration. 31. EinaneeIncome. Receipts from paying patients fluctuated somewhat at Madras, and has fallen considerably at Vizagapatam and Calicut: but the total for the triennium was Us. 38,359-1-10, a slight increase above that of the preceding one, while the collection from each such patient averaged Rs. 1871 1 as contrasted withRs. ) 96-0-6. 32. The value of asylum manufactures and products utilised in the institutions during the triennium amounted to Rs. 16,763-5-10, which was Rs. 1,346 more than before ; while those sold to the public realised only Rs. 10,977-1-7 as contrasted with the previous Rs. 14.77 4-11-10, and a prime factor herein was the fa^in receipts from garden produce at Madras. 33. The earnings of insanes.In 1908 out of a daily average strength of 461*39 at Madras, 67*94 at Vizagapatam, and 107*60 at Calicut, the proportion fit for work was 58 per cent., 69 per cent., and 53 per cent., respectively ; and those employed on remunerative labour formed only 37, 16 and 15 per cent, of the daily average strength. The profits per head for last year were Rs. 25-3-4, Rs. 47-12-10 and Rs. 48-11-10 for the asylums separately in the order named. The average for all three during the triennium was Rs. 30-7-7 or Rs. 4-2-L less than in the previous period. 34. Expenditure.The expenditure on behalf of the asylums amounted to Rs. 1,31,164-11-0 in 1906, but rose to Rs. 1,60,167-11-8 in 1907, and Rupees J.,68,914-5-11 in 1908. The principal cause for the increase was the adjustment of charges for Public Worksespecially at the Madras Asylum in 1907 and 1908the cost for new works and repairs done by the Public Works Department amounting to Rs. 49,891-15-4 at Madras, Rs. 10,467-13-11 at Vizagapatam, and Rs. 2,492-1-0 at Calicut. The cost of establishment has also risen under both heads owing to the attainment of higher military rank by the Superintendent at Madras ; certain increments earned by subordinates; and the temporary establishments entertained during epidemics. Contingencies cost Rs. 16,963-5-7 (a slight increase over the charge for 1903-1905), but would have been reduced were it not for the rates and taxes payable at Madras. Diet charges continue to rise at Madras and Vizagapatam where, in 1908, each unit cast Rs. 74-9-0 and Rs. 43-13-0, as contrasted with Rs. 68-3-0 and Rs. 36-13-0 the charges for 1907. In Calicut the cost per unit fell from Rs. 41 to Rs. 39-14-0. The average cost of an inmate's daily food supply in 1908 wasat Madras, 3-J- annas; at Vizagapatam, 1\\ annas; and at Calicut, If annas; and for the three collectively, 31| annas. The same average for the triennium was 8A annas as contrasted with 2T7? annas before ; the variation is due
HEPORT ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 9 to increase in the daily average of inmates as such, and of the weak and debilitated subjects among them. Clothing and bedding in 1908 cost Rs. 5,470-14-8, the reduction of Rs. 324-13-11 being due to the lessened demand. For the triennium the total amounted to Rs. 16,646-9-9, or Rs. 13-12-3 per unit of population ; in the previous period the total was Rs, 15,323-12-7 and each unit's share was Rs. 14-0-1. In 1903-1905 the materials purchased outside the asylums involved 16'08 per cent. of the above total; in 1906-1908 only 12*8 per cent, was so expended. On the whole the average cost per unit was Rs. 163-2-3, Rs. 197-4-3 and Rs. 200-13-7, for each successive year; and Rs. 372-6-5 for the whole triennium as contrasted with Rs. 347-7-2 of the previous term. 35. GeneralGeneral administration.The general administration of all the asylums has been satisfactory. Major Bryson resumed charge of the Madras asylum from Captain Chalmers on 1st March 1906, and was relieved by Lieutenant Heffernan on 11th November 1908. The Vizagapatam Asylum was controlled by Captain Illington until 20th November 1906, next by Lieu tenant-Colon el Pemberton until 30th June 1908, and by Major Foulkes subsequently. At Calicut, Lieutenant-Colonel Sanjana held charge until the end of March 1908, and was relieved by Captain Atal. Some changes were made in the subordinate medical staff at Madras ; and here it affords me pleasure to record that Military Assistant Surgeon F. F. R. Carreck, Deputy Superintendent, Madras Asylum, has done a great deal to secure the welfare and happiness of the inmates there. 36. Establishments.The establishment at each asylum is sufficient and equal to all ordinary requirements. A separate staff was temporarily entertained at Madras during the cholera epidemic. 37. Visitors.The official visitors for each asylum met every month ; except that in May 1906 at Vizagapatam there was no quorum, and in August 1908 at Calicut, the Superintendent was absent on other duty in the district. Their remarks have been satisfactory. His Excellency the Governor visited all the asylums in 1907. I inspected the Madras and Calicut Asylums in 1906, and all three in 1908 ; Surgeon-General Browne inspected those at Madras and Vizagapatam in 1906, and all three in 1907. The Inspector-General of Prisons made his inspection annually. 38. Inventory of stores in stock at each asylum is maintained and carefully checked. '69. The Service books of the staff have been verified and found correct. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, P. H.

Office of the Surgeon-General with the Government of Madras,. Madras, 14th April 1910, No. 97/291. From The Hon'ble Surgeon-General P. H. BENSON, m.b., v.h.s., I.M.S., Surgeon-General with the Government of Madras, To The CHIEF SECRETAEY TO GOVERNMENT, Public Department. Sir, I have the honour to submit, for the information of Government, the statistical returns of the Lunatic Asylums in the Madras Presidency, for the year 1909, with the following notes supplementary to the same. 2. statements IVIIThere remained at the beginning of the year 145 criminal and 509 civil lunatics, the females in each class numbering 14 and 152 respectively. Admissions included 41 male and 3 female criminals with 132 male and 51 female civil lunatics, the total being 2 more than in the previous year. Among them the proportion of Muhammadans rose by 5*2 per cent, and that of Native Christians by 1*7 ; that of Europeans and Eurasians fell by 5*9. The sex variations among the classes were also very marked, the proportion of females being advanced among Europeans and Eurasians by 23 per cent, and among Muhammadans by 16'5, while among Native Christians it was reduced by 7 5. As in previous years Madras City and the Malabar district supplied the largest number of entrants (55&quot;5 per cent.); while agriculture and general labour had been the occupation of 28*7 per cent, among those in employment prior to admission. The grouping under age-limits present no marked variation; and the &quot; type of insanity &quot; statement (No. VI) varied only in the admission, for the first time since 1898, of two cases of general paralysis of the insane. The cause of insanity was more often traced than heretofore, only 37 per cent, being returned as &quot; unknown &quot; in contrast with 51 and 46 in the last two years respectively ; sequentially the tabulation for known causes varies, the percentage under intoxicants and epilepsy being much increased. Two admissions found to be suffering from leprosy were lodged in the Leper Hospital, Madras, The results of treatment were satisfactory, and the mortality was a reversion to the ordinary rate after the exceptionally high figures of the last triennium. 3. The population of the asylums is steadily increasing; the daily average strength of inmates in 1909 contrasted with that of 1900 shows an advance of 24 per cent, no less than 12 of which occurred within the last three years, and 20 at Madras alone; the relative increase among females has been double that of the other sex. Concomitantly the number of inmates requiring hospital treatment is increasing each year, the daily average sick for the past three years being 56*69, 60*83 and 67*86 respectively; the statistics of Madras alone account for the whole difference. The accommodation has up to now proved sufficient. His Excellency the Governor on visiting the Madras Asylum in January 1910 suggested that the ground to the north of that institution be secured for its future extension, and the matter is now under the consideration of Government.
4 STATISTICAL RETURNS OF THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 4. Statements VIIIX.The amount recovered from paying patients formed 9*25 per cent, of the income in 1909 as contrasted with 7'54 in 1908 and 7*78 in 1907; and the value of asylum manufactures and products realised respectively 4*08, 327 and 3*64 per cent, during the same periods. The profits per head of insanes employed on remunerative labour were, for Madras, Rs. 34-0-6, for Vizagapatam, Rs. 44-1-1, and for Calicut, Rs. 51-15-8 ; an increase in each case on the figures for 1908. The total expenditure amounted to Rs. 1,65,388-9-2 ; deducting therefrom Rs. 20,122-2-3 remitted to the Treasury, the balance shows an expenditure lor the year on each inmate of Rs. 164-8-9. The corresponding figure for 1908. was Rs. 174-1-11. The strength of the establishments was maintained without change ; but the lower scale of pay drawn by the Superintendent of the Madras Asylum accounts for the large fall in the charge for &quot; Superintendence,&quot; and an earned addition to the pay of the Deputy Superintendent in the same place for the latter half of the year led to an increase under &quot; Establishment proper.&quot; The average daily cost of each diet was off annas as in the preceding year. A small increase under &quot; Contingencies&quot; resulted from better provision being made for the comfort and amusement of the inmates at Madras. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, P. H. BENSON, m.il, v.h.s., Surgeon-General, I.M.S., Surgeon- General with the Government of Madras,

STATISTICAL RETURNS OP THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN THE MADRAS PRESIDENCY FOR THE YEAR 1910. MADRAS: PRINTED BV THE SUPERINTENDENT, GOVERNMENT PRESS. 1811.
From Office of the Surgeon-General with the Government of Madras,. Madras, the lUth April 1911 No. 97/315. The Hon'ble Surgeon-General P. EL BENSON, m.b., v.h.s., I.M.S., Surgeon-General with the Government of Madras, The CHIEF SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Public Department. To Sir, I have the honour to submit, for the information of Government, the statistical returns of the Lunatic Asylums in the Madras Presidency for the year 1910. 2. The inmates numbered 521 males and 179 females at the commencement of the year: at the end of it there were 531 males and 193 females, of whom 148 and 12 respectively were criminals. The admissions comprised 171 males and 61 females. Twenty-eight per cent, of the males had resided in Malabar, and a like proportion of the females belonged to Madras. The unemployed and cases returned as of uncertain occupation formed 22*4 per cent, of admissions : and in 38*4 per cent, the cause of insanity was not traced, the increase in this rate being entirely due to female cases. The proportion of admissions from among the different classes was the same as heretofore, and a like remark applies to the prevailing i types of insanity displayed. The daily average strength was 551 civil and 163 criminals, among whom 177 and 14 respectively were females. 3. The segregation of insanes is certainly gaining public appreciation, and markedly in relation to women ; but, up to now, the majority of females brought to the asylums are merely confined to await death. Of 61 females (including 2 criminals) admitted during the year, 44 per cent, were of no ascertained occupation, 38 per. cent, were of the demented type, and 30 per cent, were between forty and sixty years of age. Females formed 27 per cent, of the daily average strength; but of lunatics employed in remunerative labour only 9 per cent, were females, Avhile the proportion of the sex among the hospital sick was over 35 per cent. 4. Several new works are under construction at the Madras Asylum ; but the land to the north of the institution has not yet been acquired for the proposed extension. At Vizagapatam were added a female hospital, a block of 6 single rooms for insanes under observation, and a rest-house for persons accompanying insanes. At Calicut a female hospital was completed, and further additions are in progress. The registered accommodation for insanes is not affected by these supplemental additions. 5. The general health of the population was satisfactory on the whole. The only variation was that in October an epidemic of cholera occurred in the Madras Asylum. It lasted nineteen days ; 22 inmates were attacked and 12 died. Captain P. Heffernan, I.M.S., Superintendent, investigated the subject carefully, and concluded that the epidemic originated in the use of a particular well, the water from which contained the cholera germ in great number. Owing to this epidemic the death-rate for the year rose to 8-5 per cent.; it was 7*95 among males and 10 among females in contrast with 4*5 and 8'2 respectively in the previous year. 6. In extension of the notes on Statement VIII relative to the Madras Asylum I must bring to notice that large increases of expenditure occurred (1) under &quot; Establishment,&quot; by the three months' privilege leave allowances paid to the Superintendent, and by the nine months' higher rate of salary drawn by the Deputy 1-A
4 STATISTICAL RETURNS OF THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS. Superintendent after his promotion; (2) under &quot; Contingencies proper,&quot; by the transfer thereto of certain wage-payments as ordered in G.O., No. 442, Financial, dated 8th October 1910; and (3) under &quot; Book charges,&quot; by the cost of buildings now in progress. These items raised the cost per head on the total treated to Rs. 196-3-8, or nearly Rs. 32 more than in 1909. On the other hand the income from paying patients was augmented by nearly Rs. 2,000; and manufactures, etc., realised better profits than in the preceding year. 7. Statement IX exhibits the sanctioned establishment of the asylums as it stood on the 3lst December 1910. A reduction of Rs. 133 per mensem in wages has been effected in carrying out the Government Order above noted. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, P. H. BENSON, m.b., v.h.s., Surgeon-General, I.M.S., Surgeon-General with the Government of Madras.

The percentages for the preceding triennium under the same headings were 18*1, 3*8, 4*7 and 19'2 respectively. The daily average strength of the asylums was 713*94 as compared with 625*14 of the last report, the proportion of female to male inmates being the same, viz., 1 to 2*8. At the end of the year 1911 there were 757 inmates under treatment, as compared with 724 at the end of 1910 and 700 at the end of J909. 3. Ages.The largest number of admissions was between the ages of 20 and 40, being for that term of life 64*32 per cent, of the total admissions and 65*4 per cent, in the trieunium 1906'1908. The next largest numljer of admissions is in the age period 40 to 60 years, being 27'64 and 23*81 percent, respectively for the two triennial periods ; the smallest, those above 00 years or 1*83 as against 3*49. 4.

As coin-pared with the previous triennium there is a decrease in the proportion of cases under &quot; unknown &quot; and &quot; moral causes.&quot; The result* of treatment.Cases of &quot;unknown&quot; origin recovered in 107 instances (18*35 per cent.) improved in 26 (4-46 per cent.) and died -in 101 (17*32 per cent.). There has thus been an increase in both the recovery and improvement ratethe figures for the previous triennium being 91 (15 per cent.) and 18 (3 percent.) respectivelythe good results bein^ better seen among&quot; males than females, as in the latter chronic and hopelessly incurable cases are admitted. Among the known physical causes ganja smoking accounted for 23 cases (28*75 per cent.) recovered, 2 (250 per cent.) improved and 3 (3*75 per cent.) died. Only the male population was thus affected. Of the cases due to heredity and congenital causes (129) 30 recovered, 4 improved and deaths numbered 20. Recovery resulted in those due to epilepsy in 12, improvement in 2, deaths in 18, of a total of 95 cases. 11. Criminal population.Criminal lunatics are received into the Madras Asylum only. There were 53 admissions and 4 re-admissions this year as compared with 35 and 7 for 1910 and 41 and 3 for 1909. There were 15 deaths during the year, 23 and 7 in the two previous years. The Superintendent assigns as a cause for the large number of deaths in 1910 which was much above the average the fact that many of those who died were very aged and degraded dements. Insanity was assigned to &quot; known causes &quot;in. 62-24 per cent, of the criminal admissions, less by 24*74 per cent, than in the previous triennium. Cases due to intoxicants numbered 16 as contrasted with 8 and 5 in the previous triennia respectively. Heredity and epilepsy contributed 24 and 18, 9 and 11 and 7 and 7being the figures respectively for the previous triennia. The daily average strength was 165*53, 163*40 and 156 15 for the three years respectively, the mean being 161*69 or 28*29 more than m the previous period. Discharges.There were 34 discharges during the year 1911 as compared with 23 in 1910 and 18 in 1909. Of the 75, 12 were transferred to the Penitentiary for further observation, 17 to the civil list being insane on the expiry of sentence, 17 discharged recovered, 25 recovered and discharged to stand trial, and 4 improved and handed over on bond. 12. Aeco?)imodation.-In the Madras Asylum with the new hospital for European females of 2&lt;&gt; beds, there is accommodation for 91 European males, and 81 females, and for 434 native males and 108 native females, which is 714 in all. The Vizagapatam Asylum can accommodate 79 native males and 17 females, and the Calicut Asylum (with the new female ward to accommodate 48 patients), 107 irales and 60 females. Increased accommodation for females, necessary in Madras and Calicut, and alluded to in the previous triennial reports, has been supplied (supra). At Madras 573 (426 males and 147 females) was the highest number confined at any one time on the 18th December 1911; at Vizagapatam 76 (59 males and 17 females) on the 21st April 1910 and at Calicut 13*2 (9b males and 36 females) on the fcth October 1911. Lavatory for European mal^s and another for European females are in process of completion in the Madras Lunatic Asylum. 13. New building*.At the Madras Asylum in 1909, 17 single rooms for natives in female enclosure, and four single rooms for Europeans in the female enclosure were built. The following works which were in process of construction in 1910 were completed in 1914:(a) A new hospital for 20 beds in female enclosure, (b) dining room for European female patients, (r) four single rooms for Europeans in Male Hospital, (d) sixteen single rooms for oivii natives (male), (e) Recreation Hall, (J) two single rooms in the criminal enclosure for Europeans, (g) a leper ward of four single rooms, (h) two observation rooms for European males, and (i) alterations in Assistant Matron's quarters for accommodating female observation cases. The land to the north of the Institution has not yet been acquired for further extension. At Vizagapatam in 1909 were constructed a latrine for the warders' lines; in 1910, (1) a block of six single cells for accommodating insanes under observation, (2) a pucca rest-house, and (3) a hospital for females in the female compound; in 1911, there were none. At Calicut the following new works were completed; in 1909, a rear verandah for the Superintendent's office; in 19K)
KEP0RT ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS. a new hospital for six females, and a new cooking range and in 1911 a new female ward with accommodation for 48 patients, a semi-permanent isolation ward for infectious cases, and a portico to the Superintendent's quarters. 14. Repairs.The usual general and annual repairs have been carried out. 15. Hospital accommodation.At Madras there was constructed during the triennium a new hospital for females, so that there is now ample accommodation. At Vizagapatam and Calicut, new hospitals for females were erected. At the Madras Asylum accommodation for males is insufficient for the increased male population. The Superintendent recommends a two-storied building with closet and bath-room annexures containing four wards of sixteen beds each or sixty-four beds altogethertwo of the present old-fashioned and unsuitable wards will have to be removed to make room for this. The matter will receive my early attention. At Madras there is at present accommodation for ninety-six males and thirty-six females; at Vizagapatam for thirteen males and five females, which is sufficient ; and at Calicut for fifteen males and ten females (including ten beds for infectious casessix male and four female). The construction of a new hospital for males with accommodation for twelve patients has been approved by Government and the Chief Engineer, Public Works Department, has been asked to prepare necessary detailed estimates and plan. 16. SanitationConservancy.No changes have taken place during the three years under this heading. The dry earth system is in use at all three Asylums, the excreta being buried in trenches and used as manure. At Madras, it is proposed to have a sewage farm, in connection with the new drainage scheme on the site situated to the south-east of the asylum compound. The Superintendent reports that the immediate surroundings are extremely insanitary. If the sewage farm is not provided, he suggests that the villages immediately adjoining the asylum wall be removed en bloc. ] 7. General hygiene.This has been satisfactorily carried out, special attention being paid to free ventilation and thorough cleansing of|the asylum buildings and to the bathing, clothing and exercise of the inmates. 18. Drainage. Yizagapatam and Calicut report that the draina.ge is quite satisfactory. At Madras a new drainage scheme is under consideration. The matter has been before the Corporation Health officer and Divisional Executive Engineer for a long time and it is hoped that it will soon be put into execution. 19. Water-supply.At Vizagapatani there is scarcity of water if the monsoons fail. For ordinary purposes water is carted from a well at some distance. The Superintendent of the Calicut Asylum reports that the supply which is from draw-wells is sufficient and good. At the Madras Asylum there have been no changesthe Red Hills water being used for drinking purposesthoroughly boiled before use, well water being used for bathing and gardening. 20. Miscellaneous.The food stuffs supplied have been good throughout. Rice ig the staple grain in the three asylums. The fortnightly weighments were regularly carried out, and the results are satisfactory. The Superintendent, Madras Asylum, suggests a large cooking range with steain ovens in a separate building for European and special diets, and a separate kitchen for Brahman patients with a Brahman cook in charge. 21. Clothing.The supply continues sufficient, and no changes have been introduced. The invalids and sick are supplied with warm jackets, and blankets, to all during the cold weather, 22. Industries and employments.The chief forms of employment were grass-farming and gardening, weaving, sewing, knitting and coir-making, and in addition at Vizagapatam and Calicut sheep and goat breeding. Selected patients and those who have some knowledge of the trades are utilized for assisting the carpenter, blacksmith, tailor, etc. No new industries were introduced during the triennium. 23. Amusmient*.These were numerous and varied. Indoor games and outdoor sports have been regularly played by those inmates who were capable of participating in them. At Madras the new Recreation Hall with a stage at one end,
REPORT ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS. capable of accommodating comfortably about 200 to 250 patients, has enabled the authorities to introduce various changes in the way of concerts and variety entertainments for the amusement of the patients. Several hundred books of light and solid reading for the library at Madras were purchased direct from home through the Superintendent of Stationery. On festival occasions treats were providedthe usual periodical ones being held in Madras. Sri Maharani, Lady Gajapathy Rao Garu and M.K.Ry. D. Bangaru Raju contributed towards these at Vizagapatatn, and Haji Currim Haji Mahomed Sait at Calicut. There is a gramophone in each of the asylums, which helps to provide music, and occasionally local bands are engaged. 24. Statistics of health and treatment of the nickSickness and its Vauses.The average daily sick was 67*80', 53*57, and bi*64 in th&laquo; three asylums together in the three years 1909, 1910 and 1U11 respectively. The mean for the triennium was 62*02greater by 9 than the last which was 53*06. This increase is due to the health of many new admissions being bad necessitating their immediate admission into the hospital, and to all acute cases of insanity requiring careful nursing and dieting being also admitted. The principal diseases from which the inmates suffered were in order of frequency :diseases of the digestive system, including dysentery and diarrhoea; of the nervous system, including mania, melancholia, etc., anaemia and debility, tubercular diseases and malarial fever. Coincidental with the increase of dysentery and diarrhoea among the population of the town there were a great many admissions of these diseases among the criminal population at Madras. 25. Forcible feeding and methods in use.Very seldom resorted to at Vizaga-patam and Calicut, but at Madras it is found a necessity. The annual mean number of feedings for the triennium was j.,392. No bad results have accrued and the method has been found suitable and satisfactory. Nasal feeding is adopted by means of a Jacques catheter and syphon tubing. 26. Mortality and its causes.The total number of deaths was 48, 79 and 69 in the three years or an average of 65*53 per annum (the large number in 1910 includes 12 from cholera in the Madras Abylum). The average for the previous triennium being 77 67. The chief causes of mortality were (a) tubercle which, as usual, heads the list, 14, 18 and 16 for the three years under report of a total of 39, 64 and 5b respectively in the Madras Asylum (Vizagapatam contributing 0, 1 and 1 of a total of 3, 6 and 6 deaths respectively and Calicut, 0, 1 and 3 of a total of 6, 9 and 7 deaths respectively) : (6) diseases of the nervous system and (c) dysentery and catarrhal inflammation of the bowels. The percentage mortality calculated on the daily average strength yields 7*09, ll*0b* and 9*lii as compared with 11-67, 16*30 and 9*11 respectively for the previous three years. 27. Epidemics and how they were dealt with.The Vizagapatam and Calicut asvlums were free from epidemics during the three years, and Madras Asylum in 1M09 and 1911, but in October 1910 a fairly severe outbreak of cholera occurred. There were 22 cases with 12 deaths, a case mortality of 54*55 per cent.the lowest on record in the Institution. I quote in extenso from the report of the Superintendent :&quot;Every possible means was taken to check the disease and all eases &quot; were treated in the contagious disease sheds and a special staff of servants were &quot; entertained for the purpose. The method of treatment was that advocated by u Major Leonard Rogers, o.i.e., I M.S. The cause of the outbreak could not be 44 definitely traced but two factors were believed to have played some important part u one was the fact that the water of the kitchen well was found to be highly conta-u minated and contained vibrios in great numbers, and it was possible that the water &quot; had been consumed by some of the patients who suffered from cholerathe other 44 was that, when the outbreak occurred, several hundred coolies were employed in 44 the asylum by various Public Works Department contractors and it was possible &quot;that one of them might have conveyed the disease by some means or other, but 44 no sickness could be traced amongst these coolies or their families.&quot; In the previous trieunium (October 1907) there were 1' attacks and 14 deaths, and in the one euding 31st December 1905, 19 attacks with 12 deaths, with a case mortality of 82*35 and 63 16 per cent, respectively. In the former of these the cause was attributed to the conveyance of infection by flies which swarmed considerably at the time
8 REPORT ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS. and in the latter, to contamination of water-supply. Although there was cholera in the town last year (1911) no cases occurred in the asylum due to the immediate steps taken for the prevention by any possible means of the outbreak occurring. The records of the asylum show that within the past 22 years, with only one exception, the outbreaks in the asylum occur in the months of August. September and October. 28. Injuries received in the asylums.In the Vizagapatam and Calicut Asylums the injuries recorded were of a trifling nature. In the Madras Asylum, of severe injuries there were 4 in 1909, 6 in 1910, and 5 in 19 LI, necessitating admission and treatment in hospital. In 1909 there were no deaths among those who received injuries; in 19JO, of the 6, 1 admitted for contusion on the forehead, the result evidently of a fall, while moving about his cell, as he was found in this state on unlocking in the morning, developed erysipelas and died. In 1911, one died from shock and internal haemorrhage with simple fracture of right thigh bone, due to a- fall from a tree while attempting to escape. He died about six hours after the injury; the usual inquest was held by the Police and a verdict of accidental death was returned. 29. Hospital diet and extras. These were sufficient and satisfactory. In Madras, the total cost was Rs. 8,672-11-5 in 1909, Rs. 7,398-11-6 in 1910 and Rs. 8,926-2-2 in 1911. The average daily cost of the European patients' diet was 9^2, 9,^, and 10j| annas in the three years respectively. There has been a steady rise from 190 1&lt; when the average cost was 6 annas due to the steady increase year after year in the cost of diet supplies. The average cost of an Indian patient's diet daily was 5-J-, 5-f and 6^ annas in the three years. In Vizagapatam the total cost was Rs. 120-6-0, Rs. 113-1-0 and Rs, 227-9-5 in 1909, 1910 and 1911, the cost of a patient's diet averaged 3, H] and 3v} annas respectively. In Calicut the figures were Rs. 502-12-6, Rs. 736-2-5 and&quot; Rs. 747-8-7 with a slight variation in average cost of from 3^ to 3f annas. The mean of these different averages for the trieunium under report yields 9| 3 6&raquo; ft 2.5 3&, and 3| annas, those for the preceding triennium being 8, 5^, 2-f-, and 3^, respectively. 30. The nursing of the sick.This was efficiently carried out by a separate staff of trained attendants in all three asylums. 31. FinanceIncomeReceipts from paying patients.Seventy-nine such were treated in the three asylums in 1911, and 76 and 72 in 1910 and 1909 respectively. In Madras alone the figures are 69, 65 and 65. There has been a steady increase yearly in the amounts realized, being Rs. 15,465-6-2, Rs. 16,890-15-8 and Rs. 16,956-7-1 for the three years. In Vizagapatam and Calicut there has not been much fluctuation in the receiptsthe mean of the two asylums being respectively for the three years Rs. 261-5-3 and Rs. 138-7-7. The total income for the triennium was Rs. 50,512-3-3, an increase of Rs. 12,153. The collection from each patient averaged Rs. 222-3-4, as contrasted with Rs. 187-1-1 in the previous triennium. 32. Asylum manufactures and; products,The value of articles made in the asylums and used therein amounted to Rs. 21,6^4-14-10 (Statement X, column 4) which was Rs. 4,931-9-0 in excess of the previous triennium due to an increase in the number of inmates. The amount paid into the treasury for articles sold to the public was Rs. 12,122-10-4 (Statement X, column 3), an increase of Rs. 1,145-8-9, due, in Madras, to a higher amount realized in garden produce, especially in 1909 and 1910; in Vizagapatam, to an increase in both manufactures and garden produce; and in Calicut to the sale of milk in 1909 and early part of 1910. The dairy farm was abolished in April 1910. 33. Haming of the insanes,In 1911, out of a daily average strength of 553*18 at Madras, 72*36 at Vizagapatam, and 124*96 at Calicut, the daily average employed on remunerative labour was 173*33, 15'46, and 20*30 respectively. The profits per head were Rs. 34-2-2, Rs. 48-4-3 and Rs. 57-15-6; the average for the three years being Rs. 34-0-8, Rs. 54-2-6, and Rs. 60-1-10, respectively in the order named above ; and for all the three asylums Rs. 49-7-0 as compared with Rs. 30-7-7 for the previous trienniuman increase attributable to the increased outturn of the manufactured goods in all the three asylums.
EEPORT ON THE LUNATJU ASYLUMS. 34. Expenditure.The expenditure on behalf of the asylums was Rupees 1,70,638-7-JO in 1909, Rs. 2,10,954-1-4 in 1910 and Es. 2,37,918-5-3 in 1911. The figures for the previous triennium being Rs. 1,31,164-11-0, Ks. 1,60,167-11-8 and Es. 1,68,914-5-11. The Madras Asylum figures for the present triennium are Hs. 1,41,495-9-0, Rs. 1,60,933-1-8 and Rs. 2,02,713-12-11, an increase of Es. 1,29,210-15-6 over the preceding triennium. A marked increase is seen under the heads:Diets ^ owing to regular and continuous increase in the asylum population each year shows a regular and proportional increase. Clothing and bedding, the same reason holds good as under diets. Contingencies proper.The wages of menials such as toties, cooks, etc., were debited to Contingencies ^Gr.O. JNo. 442, Financial, dated 8th October 1910) tor and subsequent to the last quarter of 191U, and the new &quot; Recreation Hall&quot; had to be equipped (G.O. JSo. 448, Public, dated 3rd May 1911). Rates and taxes.The increase is apparent only and is due to the Municipal Corporation not having charged for Eed Hills water during greater part of 1906 and 1907. Miscellaneous items.The steady increase is due to the rise in the number of asylum inmates, and in addition in lyll to the equipment of new buildings (G.O. No. 226 W., dated 15th March 1910) and Establishment proper.An excess of Es. 7, 0677 over that of the previous triennium, due chiefly to the increment of pay given to the Deputy Superintendent in view of his promotion, and to an increase in the number of permanent and temporary inferior servants, and famine batta given during the whole of the triennium. The variations at Vizagapatam and Calicut Asylums were trifling and call for no remarks. Diet charges.A steady rise at Madras during the triennium is to be noted ; the cost per head per annum on the total number treated being Ks. 80-5-3 for 1909, Es. 88-13-4 for 1910 and Rs. 86-9-0 for 191i. At Vizagapatam and Calicut on the other hand there has been a steady fall. At V izagapatam the figures for the triennium stand thus: Es. 42-7-0 in 1909, Rs. 36-11-8 in 1910 and Es. 33-5-0 in 1911 ; at Calicut, Es. 32-0-6 in 1909, Es. 30-2-11 in 1910 and Es. 25-1-11 in 1911. The daily average cost of an inmate's food supply was As. 4 as contrasted with S~ for the previous triennium. On the whole expenditure the cost per head per annum during this and the previous triennium calculated on the daily average strength is given below : 1906-08. 1909-11. (1) Establishment . .

Captain Heffernan, I.M.S., was in charge of the Madras Asylum for the whole triennium. At the Vizagapatam Asylum Major T. H. Fouikes, I.M.S., was in charge till the iiOth April 1911 when he was relieved by Major Illington, I.M.S. At Calicut, excluding the short periods1st January to 4th May 1909 and again from the 10th February to the 27th April 1911 when Captain Atal, I.M.S., and Major Illington, I.M.S., were in charge respectively,Captain Willoooks, I.M.S., held office as Superintendent. There were some changes in all three asylums in the subordinate medical staff. I am pleased to find that the Deputy Superintendent, Madras Asylum, Lieut. Rath Carreok's (I.S.M.D.) work is so highly appreciated by the Superintendent. He has done a great deal to secure the welfare and happiness of the inmates there. My thanks are due to Rev. L. H. Browne, Chuplain of Eerambore, for the trouble he has taken in holding a fortnightly service in the asylum for the Church of England patients. 36. EstablishmentThe nursing of the sick is efficiently carried out by a special nursing establishment. The Superintendent, Madras Asylum, complains bitterly and rightly too, I think, of the pay of matron, nurses, European attendants and inferior staff as being quite insufficient. Ho has not, owing to this cause, found it an easy matter to get suitable and efficient substitutes to fill vacancies. I am now in correspondence with him and shall shortly submit proposals in detail.
10 REPORT ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS. The Superintendent of the Calicut Asylum also complained to me at my last inspection regarding the low pay of the establishment. This is receiving my attention. 37. Visitors.The official visitors met once a month. Their remarks were satisfactory. His Excellency the Governor visited the Madras Asylum in each of the three years and the Vizagapatam Asylum in 1909. The Officiating Surgeon-General Col. Carruthers, I.M.S., visited all three in 1909. Surgeon-General Benson in company with the Director-General, I.M.S., visited the Madras Asylum in December 1909. He likewise visited all these in 1910. I inspected the Calicut Institution in 19il. The Inspector-General of Prisons inspected the Vizagapatam and Calicut Asylumsin each of the three years and in 1909 the Madras Asylum. 38. Inventory of stores is maintained and carefully checked at each asylum. 39. The service boohs have been verified and found correct. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, W. B. BANNEEMAN, m.d., c.s.i., Surgeon-General, I.M.S., Surgeon~General with the Government of Madras.
