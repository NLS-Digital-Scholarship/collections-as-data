In accordance with Government Resolution in the General Department, No. 2426 of 17th August 1887, brief notes on vaccination for the year 1912-13 are submitted with the usual statements. Control of vaccination by local authorities. 2. A report on the working of the experimental scheme relating to the control of vaccinators by Local Bodies which was tried for a further period of 12 months has been submitted to Government, and is under consideration. Strength of the Depart- ment. 3. The permanent strength of the Department was the same as last year, except for the creation of a new post of vaccinator and peon in Sind Registration District. A. temporary establishment of one clerk and three vaccinators (2 males and 1 female) was entertained for the vaccination of pilgrims at Karáchi. Temporary vaccinators were also entertained in Dhárwár, Poona, Ahmednagar and East Khándesh Districts owing to the prevalence of small- pox. Total number of persons primarily vaccinated and re- vaccinated (Appendix I, Statements I and III). 4. During the year under report there were 710,592 persons primarily vaccinated and 70,939 re-vaccinated against 692,173 and 68,692 in the previous year, showing an increase of 18,419 in primary and 2,247 in re-vaccina- tion. Increase or decrease in primary and re-vaccination. 5. There was an increase in all the districts in primary vaccination, except in Sind Registration District and Presidency Circle. In Sind there are several causes mentioned by the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner for the decrease in primary vaccinations, the most important being a reduction in the number of children available for vaccination the large number of operations performed in the two preceding years during an epidemic of small-pox, the difficulty in obtaining vaccinifers and opposition to vaccina- tion. There was a decrease of 217 re-vaccinations in the Western Registration District and of 5,167 in the Presidency Circle. Results in the number of persons primarily vacci- nated. 6. Out of 710,592 persons primarily vaccinated, 636,407 or 89.56 per cent. were successful, 13,030 or 1.83 unsuccessful while in 61,785 cases the results could not be ascertained. On account of the failure of the first operation 630 persons were operated on a second time. The percentage of success excluding &quot;unknown&quot; was 97.99. Results in re-vaccination. 7. During the year 70,939 persons were re-vaccinated. The number of successful cases was 21,995 or 31.00 per cent. In 29,599 instances the result could not be ascertained and in 19,354 the operation failed. In 9 cases the operation was repeated. Sex. 8. By sex 367,950 males and 342,642 females were primarily vaccinated and 56,790 males and 14,149 females re-vaccinated during the year under report. The total number of persons vaccinated was 424,740 males and 356,791 females. The sex percent- ages in primary vaccination were 51.78 males and 45.40 females. In re- vaccination the percentages were 80.05 males and 19.95 females and in the total number of persons vaccinated 54.35 and 45.67. L 92 Caste or race. 9. Of the total number of persons primarily vaccinated 5,894 were Christians, 537,795 Hindus, 123,617 Mahomedans, 1,641 Parsis and 41,645 persons of other caste. Age. 10. The age-details are compiled for three periods, viz., under one year, between one and six years and above six years. The number under each age-period primarily vaccinated was 559,221, 128,799 and 22,572, respectively, while the successful operations for the same age-periods were 511,423, 115,400 and 9,584. Inspection work of the Deputy Sanitary Commis- sioners. 11. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Western Registration District, visited 10 tálukas and 162 towns and villages, inspected 6,768 vaccinated persons, or 4.68 per cent. of those vaccinated, and travelled 1,378 miles. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Central Registration District, visited 13 tálukas, 97 towns and villages, inspected 4,225 vaccinated persons, or 2.27 per cent. of those vaccinated, and travelled 2,941 miles. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Southern Registration District, visited 20 tálukas, 149 towns and villages, inspected 10,166 vaccinated persons, or 6.01 per cent. of those vaccinated, and travelled 1,619 miles. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Gujarát Registration District, visited 7 tálukas, 26 towns and villages, inspected 2,126 vaccinated persons, or 1.58 per cent. of those vaccinated and travelled 1,664 miles. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Sind Registration District, visited 17 tálukas, 122 towns and villages, inspected 3,655 vaccinated persons, or 3.63 per cent. of those vaccinated, and travelled 1,776 miles. The diagram. 12. A diagram showing the proportion of population protected during seven years and the death-rate from small-pox during 1912-13 is given as Appendix IV. Cost of vaccination (State- ment No. II). 13. The expenditure on vaccination amounted to Rs. 376,586-4-8 as compared with Rs. 353,706-10-7 in 1911-1912. There was a decrease under all heads except Provincial. The successful cases excluding dispensaries were 657,475, the average cost for each successful case being annas 9 and pies 2 compared with annas 8 and pies 9 in the previous year. Vaccine Institute, Belgaum. 14. Some extensions and alterations have been proposed to the existing buildings of the institute. Building of the Director's bungalow has not yet been commenced. It is hoped that the refrigerating plant will be in working order before the monsoon of 1913. 15. During the year 7,75,587 doses were distributed as against 673,812 in 1912-13, of which 641,975 were distributed to vaccinators of the Presidency, 22,415 to vaccinators in Sind, 31,175 to medical officers and 80,022 to Native States. The results of the vaccine issued to vaccinators in the Presidency show case and insertion success rates of 97.95 and 93.85, respectively, against 99.21 and 95.70, respectively, in the previous year. The total cost of the institute was Rs. 36,578-15-6 against 34,508-11-8 in 1911-12, the excess being due to an increase in the Director's pay and allowances, greater number of stable attendants, grain compensation and travelling allowance to the staff. The cost per dose of lymph amounted to 8.71 pies against 7.26 pies last year; and allowing 4 per cent. interest on the capital cost of buildings the cost per dose works out at 11.22 pies.

Vaccination.2 further advantage of rendering possible the general transfer of the control of the vaccinating staff from the Sanitary Department to the local authorities without giving rise to the more serious of the objections and difficulties to which, as experience has shown such a measure is, in present conditions, open. 6. Towards the end of the triennium the provisions of the compulsory Vaccination Act were extended to Ahmedabad, the result being an immediate increase of 1,153 in the number of primary vaccinations performed in that city. In Hyderabad it has recently been decided to adopt compulsory vaccination, a measure the urgent necessity of which is indicated by the fact that the percentage of successful vaccinations among children of under one year of age is only 54, against 92 in the case of other Sind towns where the Act is in force. Shikarpur is another important place to which it appears desirable that its provisions should be extended. J. L.

Vaccination in Cantonments. 1. The control of vaccinators for the civil population of Cantonments has been the subject of two Government Resolutions in the General Department, Nos. 969 and 2273, dated 5th February and 23rd March 1914, respectively. Under these resolutions vacci- nation in Poona and Ahmednagar Cantonments is placed under the Canton- ment Medical offices. In Ahmednagar the vaccinator will be the Sub- Assistant Surgeon of the Cantonment Hospital. This arrangement is temporary. In Belgaum Cantonment vaccination of the population has been given as an extra duty to the Municipal Vaccinator. Control of vaccinators by local bodies. 2 The control of vaccinators by local bodies in selected districts was under trial throughout the triennial period. A special report on the result has been submitted. Changes amongst the supervising officers. 3. During the year 1913-14 the office of the Deputy Sanitary Commis- sioner, Western Registration District, was held by two officers, and that of the Gujarát and Central Registration Districts by three and four officers respectively. Strength of the department. 4. The personnel of the Department has been increased by 1 Superintend- ent of Vaccination, 4 Vaccinators, 1 temporary Vaccinator and candidate Vaccinator. Three Vacci- nators were required for Ahmednagar District, one candidate Vaccinator for Nawabshah District and the remaining members of the extra staff were occasioned by the introduction of Act I of 1892 in Ahmedabad City. Primary Vaccination2 be due to variations in the habits of the people, if of nomadic type the inspec- tion of results is impossible. Re-vaccination. 7. Owing to the prevalence of small-pox there is a marked rise in the number of re-vaccinations. During 1913-14 there was an increase over the figure for 1912-13 of 2,440 ; while the average for the triennium shows an increase of 17,453 over that for the preceding triennial period. In spite of this increase the average annual number of persons re-vaccinated during the triennium amounted only to 71,003, a very small figure in comparison with the number of adults available. Small-pox will never be stamped out till the people understand the necessity for re-vaccination. Vaccination under various establishments. 8. Vaccination in Municipalities shows a steady improvement. In the last triennial report an average annual increase of 31,375 primary operations was recorded. This rate of increase has not been maintained during the present triennium : this would have been impossible, but the average annual increase of 2,762 operations is an appreciable one. In Local Fund areas there has been an average annual rise during the present triennium of 31,486, an increase of between 6 and 7 per cent. in primary vaccinations. In the Native States there has been a steady improvement during the last three triennial periods, the average increase in the period under review being 3,301, rather under 4 per cent. In all the areas there is room for considerable improvement. Lymph supply. 9. The quality of lymph supplied was good and the results of the different kinds of lymph used are given in the following table :3 Coincident with increased production is improvement in quality or potency of the vaccine. In 1912-13 the case and insertion success rates were 97.95 per cent. and 93.85 per cent., respectively during 1913-14 these figures rose to 99.18 per cent. and 96.75 per cent. Dr. Fisher attributes these results to the introduction of cold storage. The results of work done during the recent hot weather are most encouraging. At present uniform results are not being obtained in Sind: during the cold weather months the results are excellent, but are very poor indeed during April, May, July and August. In the Presi dency proper it took many years to eradicate the faults of the vaccinators, and it is unlikely that success in Sind will be reached without initial failure. The introduction will have to be slow, and the results will be watched carefully. 11. The total expenditure of the Institute amounted to Rs. 42,596-2-9 against Rs. 36,578-15-6 in 1912-13. The increase is very largely due to automatic increment in the salaries of the staff, and of course increased produc- tion means increase in expenditure, owing to purchase of more calves, apparatus, postage stamps, etc. The working of the cold storage plant shows a net increase in cost over the purchase of ice of Rs. 638. The average cost per dose of vaccine manufactured came to 6.2 pies. Animal Vaccination. 12. Calf to arm vaccination was carried out in the Presidency Circle, Karáchi and in Kolhápur State. Human Vaccination. 13. Human lymph is still used in parts of Sind, Kolhápur State and in Káthiáwár. Cost of Vaccination4 towns and villages in 10 tálukas and travelled 2,401 miles. The Deputy Sani- tary Commissioner, Southern Registration District, travelled 1,512½ miles and visited 87 towns and villages in 12 tálukas. The Deputy Sanitary Com- missioner, Gujarát Registration District, visited 3 tálukas and 52 towns and villages and travelled 2,331½ miles. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Sind Registration District, visited 233 towns and villages in 22 tálukas and travelled 3,206½ miles. Work of the Inspector of Sanitation and Vaccination. 17. During the year the Inspectors inspected 297,960 vaccinated persons. Villages visited by the vaccinators. 18. During the year 1913-14 out of 56,519 villages 48,404 were visited by vaccinators against 47,533 in 1912-13 and 46,452 in 1911-12. The average number of villages visited for the triennium under review was 47,463 against 39,849 in the preceding triennium. Small-pox. 19. During the year under report 7,645 deaths were recorded from small- pox against 8,596 in 1912-13 and 4,904 in 1911-12. The average for the triennium under report was 7,048 against 4,386 in the preceding triennium. Diagram. 20. A diagram illustrating the proportion of population protected by vaccination in each district during seven years, with the death-rates from small-pox during each of the three years of the triennial period under review, is attached. Inoculation. 21. No inoculation was reported to have been practised in the Presidency. Ill-effects. 22. No instances of any disease were reported as having been communicated through vaccination. Compulsory Vaccination Act in Bombay City. 23. The Compulsory Vaccination Act, Bombay (No. I of 1877), has been in force for 36 years. The following table shows the progress and the protection of infants during the last six years and annual averages for three decennial periods after and for two years before the introduction of the Act:5 Years.

The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner reports that in Sukkur, Rohri and Lárkána towns 92 per cent. of infants under 1 year of age were successfully vaccinated. In Hyder- abad and Shikárpur towns, in which the Act is not in force, the percentages were 54 and 80 respectively. Compulsory Vaccination Act in Ahmedabad City. 26. The Compulsory Vaccination Act was introduced into Ahmedabad city on 6th July 1913. During the year there was an increase on the previous year of 1,153 primary vaccinations. Compulsory Vaccination Act in Aden. 27. The Compulsory Vaccination Act has resulted in a very large increase in the number of operations in Aden. Between 1905 and 1908, before the introduction of the Act the average annual number of primary vaccinations came to 4,734 ; during the triennium under review this figure rose to 14,941. F. H. G.

TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE BOMBAY PRESIDENCY FOR THE YEARS 1914-15, 1915-16, 1916-17. The control of vaccinators with the exception of those working in 5 select- ed districts, remained in the hands of the Sanitary Department. It is desir- able that local bodies should be responsible for vaccination within their respective areas ; but until each body can employ an expert to act as Super- intendent of Vaccination the realization of this ideal is impossible. 2. During the triennium three Deputy Sanitary Commissioners were re-called to military duty, and their places have been filled temporarily. One Deputy Sanitary Commissioner went on furlough for one year and returned to duty in 1916. The vaccination establishment was increased during the triennium by the appointment of 14 additional vaccinators : 5 vaccinators in Western, 5 in Southern and 4 in Sind Registration Districts. 3. For details of primary vaccination see appendix 1, statements I and III. During the year 1916-17, 708,548 persons were primarily vaccinated against 719,417 in the previous year and 723,646 in 1914-15. The average number of successful cases for the triennium was 654,078 against 637,297, an increase of 16,781. The percentage of successful cases in which the results were known was 98.88 in 1916-17 against 98.91 in 1915-16 and 97.94 in 1914-15. The steady progress in primary vaccination is shown in the following table :2 was manufactured at the Belgaum Vaccine Institute. The details are given in the following table :Vaccination.2 the presidency will be carefully studied by those who still harbour misgivings about the efficacy of vaccination as a prophylactic against small-pox.

A diagram illustrating the proportion of population protected by vaccination in each district during seven years, with the death-rates from smallpox during each of the three years of the triennial period, is given as appendix IV. 16. No inoculation was reported to have been practised in the Presidency. 17. No instances of any disease were reported as having been communi- cated through vaccination. 18. The Compulsory Vaccination Act, Bombay (No. I of 1877), has been in force in Bombay City for 39 years.

NOTES ON VACCINATION IN THE BOMBAY PRESIDENCY FOR THE YEAR 1917-1918. Redistribution of work in Surat District involved the appointment of 2 extra vaccinators and peons. In Aden the establishment of 6 vaccinators was reduced by two. 2. Seven lakhs five thousand five hundred and thirteen persons were primarily vaccinated against 708,548 in the previous year. The reduction of 3,035 does not indicate a decline in the popularity of vaccination. In Guzerat and in Sind the number of primary vaccinations fell by 6,748 and 13,399 respectively. In Guzerat the unusual incidence of plague, and in Sind the exceptional rainfall followed by a severe epidemic of malaria interfered with work. In Sind the deaths of 28,736 infants under one year were registered against 18,147 in the previous year. There were consequently fewer infants available for vaccination. In the Southern, Central and Western Registration Districts the increases in primary vaccinations were 6,813, 6,989 and 2,074 respectively in spite of the incidence of plague in all districts, and of cholera in the Southern Registration District. 3. Six lakhs fifty-four thousand four hundred and fifty primary vaccinations or 92.76 per cent. were successful;2,147 or .3 per cent. were unsuc- cessful; and the results were not ascertained in 7 per cent. of the cases. The percentage of success excluding unknown results was 99.7 per cent. 4. One hundred and four males were primarily vaccinated for every 100 females. The ratio of male to female births is practically the same. 5. Seventy-nine per cent. of the primary vaccinations were on infants under one year, and just under 20 per cent. on children between one and six years of age. 6. The revaccinations numbered 114,163 against 67,495 last year. The increase was influenced by the prevalence of small-pox. Guzerat Registration District alone returned a decrease of 974. In the Southern Registration District the increase in revaccinations came to 10,691. There were 94,656 male revaccinations and 19,507 female. There are obvious difficulties in the way of revaccination of women. Excluding unknown results the success rate for revaccinations was 56.29 per cent. The results could not be ascertained in 60.7 per cent. of operation. 7. The remarks in paragraphs 2 to 6 refer to vaccinations collated in Statements I and III Appendix 1 and in which operations in certain Native States are not included. In these areas (vide Statement No. I, Appendix 2) there were 128,973 primary vaccinations. Of these 124,360 or 96.5 per cent. were successful; and the success rate exclusive of unknown results was 98.46 per cent. Revaccinations numbered 10,693. The success rate excluding unknown results was 65.74 and the percentage of unknown results 19.5 per cent. 8. The report deals therefore with 834,486 primary vaccinations and 124,856 revaccinations. 9. Except for a few of the smaller Native States in which arm-to-arm vaccination is still practised, vaccination was carried out with vaccine supplied from the Belgaum Vaccine Institute. Twelve lakhs twenty-four thousand six hundred and ninety doses of vaccine were issued against 11,13,310 in the previous year. There was an exceptionally heavy demand from the Military and 1,35,260 doses against 51,340 in the previous year were issued to military medical officers serving with forces in and out of India. The total expenditure of the Institute for the year amounted to Rs. 40,915 against Rs. 39,507 last year. Apart from the normal rise in the salaries of the staff the actual working expenses of the Institute were less than in 1916-1917 in spite of the general rise in prices. This economy was due to the main- tenance of a high level of potency in the seed vaccine, whereby the average L 122 vaccine yield of each calf was raised by about 50 per cent., and the number of calves to be maintained and vaccinated was reduced. The high potency of the vaccine was further illustrated by the results of human vaccination received ; the case and insertion success rates came to 99.77 and 98.05 per cent. respec- tively. The year's work reflects great credit on the Director and staff of the Institute. 10. The following table gives the results for different kinds of vaccine lymph used :APPENDICES.

Strength of the Department. There was no change in the permanent vaccination staff during the year under report. Temporary vaccinators at Aden were not engaged and the new scheme for a special vacci- nation establishment not having come into force work there was carried on by the Dispensary Sub-Assistant Surgeons. Primary vaccinations (Appendix I, Statements I and III). 2. Six lakhs five hundred and forty persons were primarily vaccinated against 705,513 in the previous year. 3. The decrease was shared by all Registration Districts and is attributable to the unusual incidence of disease and death. The epidemic of malaria in Sind which began in 1917 had yet to run its course in the early months of the year and later the pandemic of influenza visited all parts of the Presidency. Failure of rains leading to evacuation of villages in some parts also had its disturbing effects on the amount of vaccination work done. The number of primary vaccinations fell by 26,744, 23,282, 16,720, 9,414 and 20,577 in Western, Central, Southern, Gujarat and Sind Registration Districts, respect- ively, and by 5,986 in the Presidency Circle and 1,874 in Aden. Results in primary vaccination. 4. Five lakhs fifty-two thousand one hundred and fifty-four primary vaccinations or 91.94 were successful, 2,031 or .3 per cent. were unsuccessful, and the results were not ascertained in 7 per cent. of the cases. The percentage of success excluding unknown results was 99.63 per cent. Sex and Age. 5. Of the primary vaccinations 79 per cent. were of infants under one year of age and 19 per cent. of children between the ages of 1 and 6 years. The proportion of males to females primarily vaccinated was as 105 to 100. Re-vaccination (Appendix I, Statements I and III). 6. Seventy-nine thousand one hundred and ninety- five persons were re-vaccinated against 114,163 last year. 7. The decrease is allocated as follows:2 The gross expenditure of the Institute for the year amounted to Rs. 42,447 or an increase of Rs. 1,532 on that of the last year. The increase was mainly under two items, viz., (a) war allowance to Estab- lishment Rs. 2,600 and (b) increase in amount of food and fodder for calves and enhanced prices of the sameAPPENDICES.

Changes amongst the supervising officers. During the year under report Lieut.-Colonel A. V. Anderson, I. M. S. (retired), held charge of the office of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Western Registration District, from 1st April to 2nd June 1920 and finally retired from the service from 3rd June 1920. Dr. Jamshyd Munsiff, M.R.C.P., F.R.C.S.E., D.P.H. (Edin.), was transferred from the Guzerat to the Western Registration District from 3rd June 1920 and held charge of that office upto 31st March 1921. The latter officer's place in Guzerat was temporarily filled by the Civil Surgeon Major Devenport Jones, I. M. S., in addition to his own duties up to 10th October 1920, after which date Dr. R. V. Shiveshwarkar, B.A., M.B.B.S., D.P.H., was appointed acting Deputy Sanitary Commissioner and held charge of that office up to the end of the financial year. 2 There was no change in the Vaccination Establishment except that the Aundh State authoritus in Satara District took over full control of their own Vaccination Establishment with effect from 1st April 1920. Primary Vaccinations (Appendix I, statements I and III). 3. During the year 1920-21, excluding Aden, 590,676 persons were primarily vaccinated against 608,535 in the previous year. There was a decrease in primary vaccination of 11,698, 8,325 and 7,032 in Western, Central and Guzerat Registration Districts, respectively. This is attributable to decrease in the number of births as a result of the Influenza epidemic of 1918-19 and the famine of 1919-20. Results in Primary Vaccination, 4. Out of 590,676 primary vaccinations, 536,184 or 90.77 per cent. were successful, 1898 (or 3 per cent.) were successful, and the results could not be ascertained in 9 per cent. of the cases. On account of the failure of the first operation 165 persons were operated on a second time. The percentage of success excluding unknown cases was 99.65. Age and Sex. 5. Of the primary vaccinations 79 per cent. were of infants under one year of age and 18 per cent. of children between the ages of 1 and 6 years. 302,602 males and 288,074 females were primarily vaccinated or a proportion of 105 to 100. Re-vaccinations (Appen- dix I, Statements I and III). 6. Excluding Aden one hundred and fifteen thousand seven hundred and forty-six persons were revaccinated against 107,205 in the last year, showing an increase of 8,541. The percentage of successful re-vaccinations, excluding unknown results, was 50.05. In 46 per cent. the result could not be ascertained. Vaccination in Native States (Appendix II, State- ment I). 7. In the Native States shown in Appendix II there were 117,569 persons primarily vaccinated against 108,477. The number of successful cases was 112,170 or 95.19 per cent. The percentage success excluding unknown was 97.75. Re-vaccinations numbered 3,602 against 3,506 in the previous year. The success rate excluding unknown was 79.80 and the percentage of unknown cases was 58.91. The total number of primary vaccinations including those in Native States, therefore, amounts to 708,245 and the total of re-vaccinations to 119,348. Vaccine Institute, Belgaum. 8. The alteration of the room in the Vaccine Institute, Belgaum, which formerly held the cold store, is proceeding, and when completed, will add a very useful laboratory for carrying out the chloroform process. A store was built convenient to the L b 62 power-house for oil, petrol, etc., used on the plant. Sanction was accorded for the installation of a storage battery which work is nearing completion. Electric current will then be available at all hours for working of the Institute. The working of the new underground cold storage room for lymph during the year was very satisfactory. The expenditure incurred in its construction has been fully justified by the results obtained. In lieu of the land handed over to the Military during the war, a new grazing ground of 72 acres was taken over from the Kurundwad State on 25th October 1920. The Military Authorities have agreed to fence the land and construct a bridge to connect up the land with the existing ground. The Executive Engineer has raised a question as to the free quarters for the staff. These quarters have been given free by Government since the opening of the Institute and the concession (conceded in similar Institutions in other Provinces) was compensatory for the inconvenient distance of the Institute from Bazar, Schools for older children, and other amenities of the town. Their duties require the presence of many of the staff at the Institute during all hours. The quality of the lymph produced at the Institute has been as hitherto uniformly excellent in quality. Seed lymphs were supplied to Madras, Hydera- bad (Deccan) and Bangalore Institutes. A strain of vaccine lymph was obtained from the Local Government Board, Lymph Establishment, London, and established as a stock lymph in the Institute. 1,362,965 doses of vaccine were issued from the Institute during the year under report, showing a decrease of 128,360 as compared with last year. The decrease in the issue was due to the smaller demand from Military Medical Officers. The gross expenditure of the Institute for the year amounted to Rs. 59,755 against Rs. 59,089 showing an increase of Rs. 666 on last year. The net expenditure after deducting sale-proceeds was Rs. 26,462 against Rs. 27,379 in the previous year. The cost of lymph per dose manufactured works out at 9.48 pies and the cost per dose despatched, worked out at 10.87 pies. The case and insertion success rates were 99.67 and 97.35, respectively, against 99.58 and 97.19 in 1919-20. 9. The following table gives the results of different kinds of lymph used:3 Inspection work of the Deputy Sanitary Commis- sioners and Inspectors. 11. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioners inspected 18,422 vaccinated persons or 2.86 per cent. in 545 towns and villages and travelled 30,782 miles. The Inspectors of Sanita- tion and Vaccination inspected 236,377 vaccinated persons in 10,259 towns and villages. Thus the results of 254,799 vaccinations or 39.56 per cent. were checked by examination. The success rate for primary vaccination as ascertained by the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners was 98.83 and by Inspectors 98.45. Small-pox Statistics. 12. The following is a list of the towns in which Compulsory Vaccination Act has been applied and shows the number of deaths from small-pox in those towns during the last five years. In some of these towns the compulsory features of the Act are not put into force. Towns. Population. 1916-17. 1917-18. 1918-19. 1919-20. 1920-21. Deaths from Small-pox. Deaths from Small-pox.

The Inspectors of Sanitation and Vaccination enquired into the vaccinal state of 650 cases of small-pox with the following results; 263 were found to have been vaccinated, of whon 15 died; of the remaining 387 unvaccinated 66 died. The case mortality was, therefore, 5.7 among vaccinated. The average age of vaccinated persons attacked by small-pox was 13 and for unvaccinated 5, while of those who died the average age among the vaccinated was 12 and the unvaccinated 5. Diagram. 14. A diagram showing the proportion of population successfully vaccinated in each district during seven years from 1st April 1914 to 31st March 1921 and the death-rate from small-pox for the year 1920-21 is given as Appendix IV. Inoculation. 15. Inoculation is still occasionally practised in outlying districts in Sind. During the year an inoculator with the assistance of the Headman of the village was found to have been operating not far from Hyderabad in a village of Tando Allahyar Taluka and these operations resulted in an outbreak of small-pox. Both offenders were prosecuted and punished by the local authorities. 16. No case of ill-effects after vaccination was reported during the year. 17. A table showing the number of vaccinations under one year of age in Municipal Towns is attached as Appendix III. Vaccination in Aden. 18. In Aden 1,726 persons were primarily vaccinated. The success rate excluding unknown was 95.25 and the percentage of unknown cases was 72.82. The number of re-vaccinations was 143. The percentage of success excluding unknown, 100.00 and the percentage of unknown cases 90.90. The total expenditure amounted to Rs. 3,556-8-0. Information from Aden was received late, hence the vaccination work of Aden is shown separately in this Report. W. O'S.

Kohri Town .. .. .. .. .. 5 Larkana TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE BOMBAY PRESIDENCY FOR THE YEARS 1917-18, 1918-19, 1919-20. Vaccinators employed in the Selected Districts remained under the control of Local Bodies throughout the triennial period. 2. During the triennium the services of Lieut.-Colonel F. H. G. Hutchinson, I. M. S., were transferred to the Imperial Department as Sanitary Commissioner with the Government of India and Lieut.-Colonel W. O.'S Murphy, I. M. S., took charge of the office of the Sanitary Commissioner for the Government of Bombay on 1st March 1919. Three Deputy Sanitary Commissioners and the Director of the Vaccine Institute, Belgaum, were on leave. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Gujarat Registration District, was on deputation in Poona for two months to prepare a Manual of Vital Satistics. The vacancies so caused were filled tem- porarily. The Vaccination establishment was increased by two vaccinators in Gujarat Registration District, two in Aden and one candidate vaccinator in the Western Registration District during the triennial period under report. A temporary establishment consisting of one male and one female vaccinator, one clerk and one cooly was entertained for the vaccination of pilgrims in Karachi. A full-time Superintendent of Vaccination has been appointed for Hyderabad town. 3. For details of primary vaccination see appendix I, statements I and III. 4. During the year 1919-20, 611,050 persons were primarily vaccinated against 600,540 in the previous year and 705,513 in 1917-18. The average number of successful cases for the triennium was 586,049 against 654,078, a decrease of 68,029. The percentage of successful cases in which the results were known was 99.47 against 99.63 in 1918-19 and 99.67 in 1917-18. The average annual number of vaccinations and the average annual success rate for the last three triennial periods is shown below :2 7. In the Native States shown in Appendix II there were 108,477 persons primarily vaccinated, against 109,028 in the previous year and 128,973 in 1917-18. The annual average number of successful cases for the triennium was 111,098 against 142,501 in the preceding triennium. The percentage of success in which the results were known was 98.55 against 98.61 in 1918-19 and 98.46 in 1917-18. Re-vaccinations numbered 3,506 against 3,919 in the previous year and 10,693 in 1917-18. The success rate excluding unknown results was 68.83 and the percentage of unknown results 55.63. The total number of persons primarily vaccinated including those in Native States therefore amounted to 719,527 and the total of re-vaccinations to 110,889 against 709,568 and 83,114 in 1918-19. 8. The quality of lymph supplied was on the whole good ; animal lymph was used in Presidency Circle, Bombay, and human lymph in some Native States attached to Gujarat Registration District. The results of the different kinds of lymph used are given in the following table :3 10. The expenditure on vaccination and the cost of each successful opera- tion during each year of the triennium is given in the following table :4 18. Inoculation was not practised in the Presidency. 19. No instance of any disease being communicated through vaccination was reported. 20. The Compulsory Vaccination Act, Bombay (No. I of 1877), has been in force in the Bombay City for 42 years. The following table shows the progress made, the protection of infants during the last twelve years, and the annual average number of vaccinations performed during the two years preceding, and the three decennial periods succeeding, the introduction of the Act:5 22. The percentage of children successfully vaccinated under 1 year in Sukkur, Rohri and Larkana Towns was 52 in 1919-20 against 90 in 1918-19. In Hyderabad the percentage was 56 against 59 in the last year. 23. There was a decrease of 1,450 in the average annual number of primary vaccinations during the triennial period in Ahmedabad City, where a Compulsory Vaccination Act has been introduced, as compared with the last triennium. This decrease was due to the diminished birth-rate resulting from the Influenza epidemic in 1918. 24. In Aden the Compulsory Vaccination Act came into force on 28th Decem- ber 1916. The average annual number of primary vaccinations performed during the triennial period was 1,964, against 8,104 during the last triennium. The fall was due to the lessened incidence of Small-pox. 25. In Deolali cantonment a Compulsory Vaccination Act was introduced in August 1915. During the triennial period there was an increase of 72 primary vaccinations over the preceding triennium. H.

NOTES ON VACCINATION IN THE BOMBAY PRESIDENCY FOR THE YEAR 1921-22. The Sanitary Department and its Officers, Sanitary and Deputy Sanitary Commissioners were changed in designation to Public Health Department, Director and Assistant Directors under Government Order, General Depart- ment, No. 1063 of 26th October 1921. Changes in area. 2. A new district to be known as Bombay Suburban District was formed from part of Thana District. Supervision of Janjira in Kolaba Collectorate was transferred to the State Authorities. The statistics of Janjira and of Kolhapur and Southern Maratha Country States are shown in Appendix II. Changes amongst the staff. 3. During the year under report there was no change in the Supervising Officers except that Lieut.-Colonel J. H. McDonald, M.B , C.M., I.M.S., was in charge of the Office of Assistant Director of Public Health, Western Regis- tration District, from 19th November 1921 to 31st March 1922, in addition to his own duties during absence on sick leave of Dr. Jamshyd Munsiff, M.R.C.P., F.R.C.S., D.P.H. (Edin). There was no numerical change in Vaccination Establishment. But in the Bijapur District since 1st October 1921 a Touring Vaccinator for depressed classes has been appointed by the District Local Board. The post of a paid candidate vaccinator of the Mahi Kantha Agency was abolished. Primary vaccinations (Appendix I, Statements I and III). 4. During the year 1921-22, 581,366 persons were primarily vaccinated against 544;307 in the previous year. In all Registra- tion Districts there was an increase in primary vacci- nations due to recovery in the birth rate from the effects of unhealthy years of influenza and plague and its consequence that more children were available for vaccination purposes. Results in primary vaccinations. 5. Out of 581,366 vaccinations 522,965 or 89.95 per cent. were successful, 1,969 or 33 per cent. were unsuccessful and the results could not be ascertained in 9.72 per cent. of the cases. Owing to failure of the first operation 78 persons were operated on a second time. The percentage of success excluding unknown cases was 99.62. Age and sex. 6. Of the primary vaccinations 459,908 or 79 per cent. were of infants under one year of age and 107,725 or 19 per cent. of children between the ages of 1 and 6 years. 298,738 males and 282,628 females were primarily vaccinated or a proportion of 105 to 100. Re-vaccinations ( Appen- dix I, Statements I and III). 7. 92,377 persons were re-vaccinated against 111,599 in the last year shewing a decrease of 19,222. Re-vaccination is not popular in the absence of epidemic small-pox and the year under review was with one exception (1915) the lowest in fatality from that disease to which the decrease in re-vaccination is attributable. The percentage of successful re-vaccination excluding unknown results was 46.45 per cent. ; in 42 per cent. the results could not be ascertained. Vaccination in Native States ( Appendix II, State- ment I). 8. In the Native States shewn in Appendix II, 168,187 persons were primarily vaccinated against 163,664. The number of successful cases was 164,832 or 98 per cent. The percentage success excluding unknown was 99.44. Re-vaccinations numbered 6,985 against 7,892 in the previous year. The success rate excluding unknown was 70.94 and the percentage of unknown cases was 23.44. The total number of primary vaccinations including those in Native States, therefore, amounts to 749,553 and the total of re-vaccinations 99,362. P 22 Movements regarding vaccination. 9. An active anti-vaccination propaganda was carried on in parts of Sind by public speeches, and by writings in a section of the Press. In Hyderabad a society styling itself the Anti-Vaccination League came into being. The agents of the movement have on some occasions appeared in villages to hamper the vaccinator in his work and have for the time influenced parents to withhold their children from vaccination and for inspection of results. Some increase in opposition to this measure is also reported from other districts. Nevertheless vaccination has on the whole been fairly satisfactory throughout the year.

INDEX. TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION FOR THE YEARS 1920-21, 1921-22, 1922-23. (Prescribed maximum length2 INDEX. Statement No. II.TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE BOMBAY PRESIDENCY FOR THE YEARS 1920-21, 1921-22, 1922-23. Changes in designation. Under Government Order, General Department, No. 1063 of 26th October 1921, the designation of the Department was changed from the Sanitary to the Public Health Department2 year 1921-1922 among immigrants from Makran and Cutch who driven from their own countries by famine were attracted to Karachi and Sind in search of employment in the labour market. These people were mostly unvaccinated on arrival. They returned to their homes on the resumption of normal conditions. In Aden, during the year 1922-1923, 45,865 primary vaccinations and 23,668 re-vaccinations were performed against 3,676 and 48 in the previous year, this great increase in number being due to an epidemic of small-pox. In addition to the ordinary male staff, female vaccinators were appointed to pay house to house visits and to vaccinate as many women and children as possible. Sanitary Inspectors also vigorously carried out vaccination in their respective divisions while local men were also engaged and posted at the police stations to vaccinate any unprotected persons brought in by the police. The A.D.M.S. (and C.A.M.O.), Aden, reports as follows :3 7. The total number of persons primarily vaccinated including those in Native States, therefore, amounted to 809,294 and the total of re-vaccinations to 107,806 against 749,553 and 99,362 in 1921-22. The Assistant Director of Public Health visited Surat while the small-pox epidemic was in progress in April 1922 and made an inspection of the affected localities, a house to house vaccination campaign being organised. The Municipality engaged an extra vaccinator for this purpose. The outbreak which commenced in February 1922 ceased in July of the same year. In 1922-23, 4,390 pilgrims proceeding to Hedjaz were re-vaccinated in Karachi town at a cost of Rs. 702-4-0 against Rs. 736-14-9 in the previous year. A single pilgrim was primarily vaccinated. In Guzerat a scheme for conducting a special vaccination campaign among school children in municipal towns and taluka headquarters during the monsoon of each year was carried out and the results obtained during the last three years are shown below :4 the previous year. The average cost of lymyh per dose manufactured including interest on capital works out at 14.20 pies and the cost per dose despatched from the Institute at 16.11 pies. The latter figure includes cost of packing materials and postal charges. Lymph in use. 9. The quality of lymph supplied from the Belgaum Vaccine Institute was excellent as can be judged by the high percentage of successes obtained. The Bombay City Municipality took 2,200 doses of preserved lymph from the Institute in addition to using animal lymph of their own manufacture. The Municipality has now decided to obtain all lymph requisite for their needs from the Belgaum Institute. The results of the different kinds of lymph used are given in the following table :5 examination. The success rate for primary vaccinations as ascertained by the Assistant Directors of Public Health was 98.36 and by Inspectors 98.63 as against 98.83 and 98.45 respectively in the previous year. Compulsory Vaccination. 12. The Compulsory Vaccination Act has been in force in the Bombay City for the last 45 years. The following table shows the progress made in the protection of infants during the last five years and the annual average number of vaccinations performed during the two years preceding and the four decennial periods succeeding the introduction of the Act:6 The following table shows the progress of vaccination work made in Ahmedabad City where the Compulsory Vaccination Act has been in force for nine years :7 Movements regarding Vaccination. 14. An active anti-vaccination propaganda was carried out in Sind (Hyderabad District). Some increase in opposition to vaccination was also reported from other Registration Districts; nevertheless vaccination continues on the whole to maintain its position in the estimation of the people as a sure defence against small-pox. Inoculation. 15. Inoculation with small-pox virus was reported to have been practised during the year 1921-22 in some parts of Sind, and necessary action has been taken to prevent further occurrences of the kind. 16. No cases of ill effects after vaccination were reported during the triennium. Diagram. 17. A diagram illustrating the proportion of population protected by vaccination in each District during seven years with the death-rates from small-pox during each of the three years of the triennial period is given as Appendix IV. 18.
