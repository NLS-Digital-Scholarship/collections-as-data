The large size of the villages in this Presidency, must make it extremely difficult for the munsif to even see the carcase in the majority of cases. In order to try and verify these returns as far as possible, touring Veterinary Assist- ants have recently been instructed to submit specimens, taken from some of the affected animals in every outbreak to which they are called, to the Head office for microscopical examination. To begin with, confirmation will only be made in a very small percentage of cases, but if munsifs can be persuaded or compelled by District officers to report every outbreak, and the number of touring Assistants increased in each district, so as to ensure prompt attendance, this percentage should rise high enough to be, at least, a slight check on munsifs' returns. So as to prevent delay, the Principal of the Madras Veterinary College has kindly promised to examine the specimens when the Superintendent is out in camp. Glanders.4 No. 2642, REVENUE, 30TH AUGUST 1911. those places are not therefore included in the list in table V. The year's returns call for little comment, as with the exception of Trichinopoly and Tiruvannámalai, both of which show a creditable increase, there is very little change either way from the figures of last year. The returns from Berhampur and Ongole are very disappointing, but as both of them were opened only during the previous year, better results may be forthcoming in future. III.No. 2642, REVENUE, 30TH AUGUST 1911. 5 The Ongole Show attracted only 729 entries this year, showing a decrease of 413 from the previous year. This was attributed to the show being held a little earlier than usual, before the harvest was finished. There was also said to be a falling-off in the quality of the young stock, but prices nevertheless were good, and many animals changed hands. The Ellore. Show was not a success. Some of the animals exhibited at the Ongole show, a few weeks before, were again shown here, but the object of the show being to improve local cattle, very few prizes were offered for cattle not bred in the district. The exhibits from the district were so poor that it was considered advisable to withhold the medals offered by Government for the best bull and best cow in the show. Major Dawson attended the shows at Berhampur, Madura and Tiruppur and submitted his remarks to the Board in a separate report. IV.6 No. 2642, REVENUE, 30TH AUGUST 1911. much more help is needed from such officials as Tahsildars and Revenue Inspectors, who, during their tours of inspection, might do a great deal to increase the popu- larity and advertise the existence of the Veterinary Assistant. 4. There is still a great deal to be. done in the way of expanding the depart- ment both as regards the institution of more hospitals and the posting of more itinerating men to each district. At the end of the year under report there were still ten districts without a veterinary hospital of any description, although in four of these the question of starting one was under consideration. Each district is now supplied with at least one itinerating man, but one is not sufficient for any but the very smallest districts, and for large districts like Vizagapatam, Gódávari, Kistna, etc., at least three men are required. The demand for veterinary graduates in this Presidency is therefore likely to exceed the supply for some time to come, and it is to be hoped that every effort will be made to attract matriculates to the college for training, as great difficulty has been experienced during the last four years in getting students with sufficient education to enable them to qualify as competent Veterinary Assistants.

This systematic touring of veterinary assistants in addition to the gradually enlarging number of veterinary hospitals in the Presidency will of course necessitate far more touring by the Superintendent and his inspecting officers. It has already been recorded that a Deputy Superintendent has been appointed and the appointment of three additional inspectors sanctioned, but as pointed out by the Superintendent in a recent report on the subject the appointment of these officers while relieving the Superintendent of a certain amount of routine inspection work, and enabling him to keep a closer hold on his assistants, will not relieve him of the necessity of covering each year the whole of this Presidency the area of which is enormous. It is this time which is taken up in travelling that prevents the Superintendent from spending more than a few days in any one district, personally attending outbreaks of rinderpest and other diseases and supervising the work of his assistants in the field. Under present conditions the Superintendent may meet with an outbreak of disease in the part of the province in which he happens to be touring (this happened once during the year under report) but otherwise he will not have an opportunity of doing any field work, for he cannot put off one tour to attend an outbreak in another part of the province without seriously interfering with his year's work. By the appointment of a second Superintendent, the Presidency could be divided into two parts and each Superintendent would then be able to spend at least a month in half the districts under his charge. 3. The Superintendent has much pleasure in recording the great help and sympathy in veterinary matters he invariably received from all district officials throughout the Presidency. There is no need to point out how, for the advancement of this department in the Mufassal, it is imperative that it should have the entire sympathy of these officials and the Superintendent trusts there will be no lessening in that respect in the future. In addition the Superintendent wishes to thank M.R.Ry. V. P. Subramania Mudaliar, the newly appointed Deputy Superintendent, for the great help he has been since his appointment. He has invariably carried out the duties allotted to him most cheerfully and well. F. WARE, Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department.

There was a satisfactory increase in the number of cases treated and castrated by touring veterinary assistants.

ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT MADRAS PRESIDENCY FOR 1912-1913. Proceedings of the Board of Revenue (R.S., Sur., L. Rds., and Agri.), No. 212, dated 28th July 1913. The Hon'ble Mr. A. BUTTERWORTH. Read2 three Government Stallions and Bulls NOS. 3, 5,14,20 and 21. In addition he visited Mangalore and Nandyal in connection with the selection of sites for the hospitals proposed to be opened at those places, attended the Cattle Show at Ongole and served as a member of the Board of Examiners, which sat at the Madras Veterinary College in December. Mr. Kerr was in camp for 82 days and covered 3,954 miles by rail and 416 miles by road. The hospitals at Coimbatore, Trichinopoly, Tanjore, Tinnevelly, Madura, Sivaganga, Sivagiri, Ongole and Saidapet as well as the serum stored at Guindy, and the Cattle Quarantine Depot, Tuticorin, were inspected by him. He selected sites for the proposed hospitals at Mangalore, Madanapalle and Nandyal. He made an extended tour in South Malabar and the Nilgiri-Wynaad inspecting the forest elephants and the work of the Special Veterinary Inspector, as a result of which he formulated proposals for strengthening the Veterinary Staff with the Forest Department. A Veterinary Assistant on Rs. 503 It is interesting to speculate on what would have occurred in Kistna if the mobile corps or some such extra staff of inoculators had not been available to work there, while the disease was repeatedly being reported from several places at the same time. In numerous cases it was demonstrated that the disease was introduced into a village by animals returning from grazing areas, in most instances in Hyderabad, and as fast as it was stamped out by inoculation in one batch of villages it would be reported from others. This state of things accounts for the large number of inoculations carried out in Kistna, for of the total number returned for this district, 21,884 were performed by the members of the mobile corps. That corps was formed in June 1912. and consisted of six Assistants under the senior Inspector in the department M.R.Ry. K. Kailasam Aiyar. It began operations in R4 out during an outbreak: and as the disease in this Presidency, although very common, never seems to carry off more than a few animals in each village, ryots cannot be persuaded to have it done until the disease actually breaks out. Black quarter.5 A very satisfactory increase is reported from Ongole, Ellore, Coimbatore, Tiru- vannamalai and Berhampur. Veterinary Assistant, Natesa Aiyar, in charge of the first named, deserves great credit for the vast improvement he has made. The Sivaganga hospital does not show much improvement in spite of a change of Assist- ant, while Vellore is still as poor as ever. The remission of fees in the case of agricultural stock and jutka ponies at the last mentioned hospital was sanctioned only at the end of the year, but the same concession granted earlier by the District Board for the Berhampur hospital resulted in an appreciable increase. The most considerable drops in the number of admissions occurred at Cocanada, Vizianagram and Tanjore. The removal of a number of old decrepit animals from the Samasthanam and the introduction of fees for outside patients are given as the cause at Vizianagram, while a similar sale of Palace animals is reported from Tanjore. No explanation is offered for the fall at Cocanada. The Court of Wards opened a new hospital at Parl6 A large number of fairs were attended by Veterinary Assistants in the course of their ordinary tours, while the Cattle Diseases Act was enforced at the more important annual fairs at Kazhugumalai, Sivalaperi, Azhwartirunagiri, Kanniseri, Muthalapurara, Sankaranayinarkoyil, Timmarajapuram, Tiruvannamalai, Kulgunda, Melmalayanur and Mailam and a Special Veterinary Assistant deputed in each case to carry out its provisions. IV.7 was ever increasing, to the prejudice of their legitimate work in the field. It was pointed out by this office that not only was relief from clerical duties needed by the Superintendent in this province, but owing to the size of his charge it was highly desirable to appoint a second European Superintendent to enable some research and practical work to be done in the field, and to admit of more time being spent in each district than is at present possible. The Board agreed that the Superintendent needed relief and suggested the appointment of three Deputy Seperintendents but it was shown that no men were available to fill these posts and Government decided that the Superintendent's office work and the expansion of Veterinary operations in this Presidency were not suffi- cient to call for the immediate appointment of a second Superintendent. It is sub- mitted that the surest way of developing the operations of the department on the right lines, now that every district has been provided with some members of the subordinate staff, would be by the appointment of such an officer to take charge of half the Presidency. 3. The discussion referred to in the last paragraph has at least served the use- ful purpose of bringing forward once more the question of the training of Deputy Superintendents. Whether or not a second Superintendent is appointed to this Presi- dency in the near future, as the developement of the department proceeds Deputy Superintendents will eventually become a necessity, unless the superior staff is considerably augmented. In this Presidency one could point to several men who would make suitable Deputy Superintendents if they could be given the necessary post-graduate training. By this is meant a training which it is not possible for a Provincial College, equipped and staffed as the Madras Veterinary College is at present, to give. As this same difficulty is reported from other provinces it is submitted that this question calls for the immediate attention of the Government of India. 4. A local allowance of Rs. 5 per mensem was sanctioned during the year for touring Veterinary Assistants in order to bring these posts more on a level with the comparatively more attractive hospital charges. 5. The cooling apparatus for the King Institute having been installed, the anti- rinderpest serum and other sera and vaccines required for this Presidency have been stocked there since July 1912, which arrangement has proved of great advantage. No store has yet been made at Coonoor for the use of the Nilgiris, as the refri- gerating chamber does not appear to have been built there yet. 6. The Superintendent regrets to have to report the death during the year of Veterinary Inspector Khan Sahib Hasan Ali. The deceased was first appointed as a local Cattle Disease Inspector in 1885 and was afterwards sent on deputation to the Bombay Veterinary College, whence he graduated in 1895. In all he served this Government for 27 years, for which, and in particular for his services in connec- tion with the organisation of cattle shows in this Presidency, he was made a Khan Sahib at the Delhi Durbar of 1911.

21 and "poisoning" be excluded, the result is a continuance of the gratifying decline in mortality from disease which has been observable since 1908-09. The drop is parti- cularly noticeable under rinderpest, the figures for the five years being 149,666; 56,900; 24,435; 10,572; 6,112. No doubt a portion of this decline may be attri- buted to inoculation. The Superintendent has not explained the very large increase under "other (non-contagious) causes." It is probably due to better registration but also to the erroneous inclusion of deaths from natural decay to prevent which the Board has recently revised the headings of the returns. The Board has also, on the advice of the Superintendent, revised the list of vernacular names of diseases so as to get rid of one cause of the confusion referred to in the present report under the head "Anthrax". 6. Subordinate establishment22 Order23 The decrease in the number of deaths from rinderpest and anthrax, the two most serious diseases, is striking, and is no doubt in part at least due to the work of the Civil Veterinary Department. 7. The number of breeding bulls kept during the year was 19. The present system of maintenance is admittedly unsatisfactory; but the whole question of improving the breeds of cattle in the Presidency is under consideration and the Government hope to devise more satisfactory methods than those now employed. 8.

As observed by the Board of Examiners, the results were satisfactory. It was, however, noticed by the exam- iners that there was a tendency on the part of the students to neglect the practical side of their profession. The Principal attributes this to the fact that the practical classes were taken by new lecturers in his own absence for two months and that of several experienced members of the teaching staff for varying periods during the year on account of leave and other causes. In order to increase the output of veteri- nary graduates to meet the growing demand for veterinary officers in this Presidency, Government have raised the number of annual admissions to the college from 20 to 30.

He had been deputed to be in charge of the Madras War Fund horses on the voyage to Europe and to hand them over to the military authorities and he sailed with the horses on 27th October 1914 and returned to Madras and took over charge of his appointment again on 25th January 1915. For this interval Mr. Pool, I.C.V.D., acted as Principal. 2. During the year under review the college experienced many interruptions and changes amongst the teaching staff which contended against a high standard of work: nevertheless the results were satisfactory. Mr. D'Silva, the Assistant Principal, was on combined sick and privilege leave for six months from 1st July 1914 to 1st January 1915. It was not until the 5th September 1914 that Mr. A. J. Wilson joined duty as a relief lecturer so that for over two months the Assistant Principal's duties had to be carried on by the other members of the staff. The information that Mr. Valladares had been confirmed as Deputy Superin- tendent, Central Provinces, was received in the office on the 7th July 1914. In consequence Mr. H. C. Sampathu Ayyangar was confirmed in his sub. pro tem. appointment as senior lecturer. Mr. V. Krishnamurti who had been acting third lecturer was appointed second lecturer on probation and Mr. Shankaramurthia Pillai who had been second lecturer sub. pro tem. reverted to his previous appointment of third lecturer. At a later date the Principal recommended that Mr. S. Shankara- murthia Pillai should be reverted to the Civil Veterinary Department and that Mr. Wilson should be appointed third lecturer on probation. The Board approved of the recommendation on the 16th November 1914 but in view of the absence of the Assistant Principal on leave sanctioned the retention of Mr. S. S. Pillai on the college staff as an extra lecturer until the 5th January 1915 when he joined the Civil Veterinary Department. The House-surgeonship was held by Mr. L. Subrahmanya Ayyar at the begin- ning of the year and he continued in the appointment until the 30th September 1914 when he reverted to the Civil Veterinary Department. The appointment was then filled by Mr. N. Muniappa who continues to hold it. 3.

A satisfactory feature of the year is the large increase in the number of rinderpest inoculations, the figures being 94,944 against 38,947 for the previous year. There was also a decided improvement in the aggregate outturn of work by touring veterinary officers, the total number of cases treated having risen from 8,868 for 1912-13 and 12,264 for 1913-14 to 21,483 in the period under review. All districts, however, did not share in this improvement; the Government observe that the out- turn, as judged by the figures appearing in Table No. IV, was particularly indifferent in Tanjore. 5. In spite of the preventive measures taken by the department the ravages of rinderpest proved exceptionally severe and the deaths from anthrax also show a considerable increase. The Superintendent has not touched on the causes of this increased mortality, especially from rinderpest, or on the results of the inoculation work carried out as a prophylactic or cure. The Government would like this subject investigated and the conclusions arrived at formulated either in a special report or in the next annual report. Unfortunately the paucity of trained hands makes it impossible at present to conduct a systematic campaign against rinderpest on an adequate scale. As a means of controlling importation from the adjoining States of Hyderabad and Mysore, the Superintendent has arranged, however, for timely inti- mation of outbreaks of rinderpest occurring in taluks bordering on Madras districts in return for similar information in regard to British territory. 6. With a view to remedy the deficiency in staff the Government have increased the number of annual admissions in the Veterinary College from 20 to 30 and have also under their consideration the feasibility of a further temporary increase from 30 to 40. The report of the Principal discloses the fact that though there is no longer any difficulty in securing a sufficient number of candidates qualified for admission, a large number of those selected actually fail to join the College. This circumstance shows the necessity of selecting in the first instance a large number of candidates than is required so as to ensure that the ultimate strength of each year's class shall not fall materially short of the strength desired. 7. The prolonged use of temporary depots as places of quarantine for cattle destined for Ceylon having proved most unsatisfactory, the Government hope before long to see a permanent depot established at a suitable site. The final selection of the site, however, awaits the decision of the Government of Celyon as to whether the cattle trade should in future be carried on via Dhanushkodi or as at present by the Tuticorin route. 8. M.R.Ry. V. P. Subramanya Mudaliyar Avargal, Deputy Superintendent of the Civil Veterinary Department, having retired with effect from 14th August 1915, M.R.Ry. H. C. Sampattu Ayyangar, Senior Lecturer of the Madras Veterinary College, has since been appointed to the post. 9. The Government desire to express their appreciation of the work accomplished by the officers of the department during the year under review. (True Extract.) L. DAVIDSON, Secretary to Government.

ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT MADRAS PRESIDENCY FOR 1915-1916. Proceedings of the Board of Revenue (R.S., Sur., L. Rds. and Agri.), No. 210, dated 28th July 1916. The Hon'ble Mr. LL. E. BUCKLE, Commissioner of Revenue Settlement, Survey, Land Records and Agriculture. ReadM.R.Ry. V. P. Subrahmanya Mudaliyar Avargal held the office of Deputy Superintendent until 14th August 1915 when he retired. He was 67 days on tour and travelled 3,941 miles by rail and 302 miles by road and by boat. He inspected the hospitals and dispensaries at Vellore, Tiruvann?- malai, Vizianagram, Parl?kimedi, Berhampur, Vizagapatam, Pithapuram, Cocanada, Rajahmundry, Nellore, Ongole, Ellore, Madura and Gunt?r and the work of the touring Veterinary Assistants of North Arcot, Cuddapah, Nellore, Gunt?r, Kistna and Madura districts and of Vizianagram, Vizagapatam, Berhampur, Cocanada and Rajahmundry divisions. The work of the Mobile corps in Nellore district was also inspected by him. He also visited Nandyal in connection with the selection of a site for the veterinary dispensary proposed to be opened there, inspected Government bull No. 20 and the Government elephants in Chicacole, Parl?kimedi and Polavaram, and attended the annual cattle show held at Madura. M.R.Ry. H. C. Sampath Ayyangar was appointed Deputy Superintendent vice M.R.Ry. V. P. Subrahmanya Mudaliyar, retired. He assumed charge on the afternoon of 14th August 1915 and continued to hold the office till the end of the year. He spent 111 days out of head-quarters covered 5,369 miles by rail and 614 miles by road. He inspected the hospitals and dispensaries at Cuddalore, Erode, Coimbatore, Calicut, Bellary, Hindupur, Madura, Sivagiri, Sivaganga, Trichinopoly, Tanjore, Ad?ni, Ranipet, Tinnevelly, Sr?villiputt?r and Negapatam, the work of the touring Veterinary Assistants of South Arcot, Malabar, South Canara, Salem, Chittoor, Anantapur, Bellary, Kurnool, Madura, Tinnevelly, R?mn?d, Trichinopoly and Tanjore districts and of Cocanada division, the office of the Veterinary Inspectors, III, V, VI and VII circles, the Cattle Quarantine depot at Tattaparai, the work of the Mobile corps at Cocanada, the two Government stallions and bulls Nos. 3, 23 and 24. He visited Nandyal and selected the building in which the veterinary dispen- sary there is now located. He attended the cattle fairs at Ranipet and Kazhugumalai and the cattle show at Ongole. II.3 Glanders and dourine.4 (ii) Other diseases.5 The depot continued to be at Tataparai throughout the year, but the difficulties experienced there appear to be insuperable, so the lesser of two evils has been chosen and it has been decided to return to Tuticorin as soon as possible. During the year an officer of the rank of Inspector was placed in charge of the depot. An outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease occurred in the early part of the year but there were no deaths. Six cattle and 15 goats died of anthrax in the depot during the year. III.6 W. J. D'Costa and Veterinary Assistant S. R. Lakshman continue to be on Military duty, but Veterinary Assistant S. C. Jeyasing Raj has been invalided from that duty and is now on leave. Veterinary Assistant R. Rajamanickam Pillai joined the Silladar Cavalry Veterinary Reserve for service in India at the beginning of the current official year. (ii) Office establishment.7 (vi) The question of how a touring veterinary assistant should be supplied with a peon when in camp has been decided by the issue of orders by the Board of Revenue that in all districts the Tahsildar of the taluk in which the veterinary assistant happens to be working should depute a peon to assist him and accompany him on his tours in the taluk. It is hoped that this will give general satisfaction. (vii) With a view to introduce the Act for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, XI of 1890, in municipalities in which veterinary hospitals have been located, the Collectors of the districts concerned were addressed. The proposal was well received and Government have extended the Act to all the municipalities con- cerned and have asked the District Magistrates to issue instructions to all magistrates who try cases under the Act to make use of the provisions in section 6 (3) of the Act, under which an animal can be sent to a veterinary infirmary for compulsory treatment. (viii) The difficulty experienced in obtaining suitable compounders for Veterinary hospitals, first reported several years ago, increased to such an extent that the Board was again addressed to open a class for training these men. An arrange- ment has now been made by which a class will be held at the Madras Veterinary College during the summer vacation, and this should solve the difficulty for the future. (ix) The department and the public generally have suffered a loss through the retirement of M.R.Ry. V. P. Subrahmanya Mudaliyar Avargal. He entered Government service first in July 1885 as a Cattle Disease Inspector and after gradu- ating at the Bombay Veterinary College rose through the different grades of this department until he was appointed Deputy Superintendent in May 1911. He thus had 30 years of approved service to his credit when he retired on 14 th August 1915. (x) There are now over 100 subordinates and 35 hospitals under the control of the Superintendent of this department. Although he spent over five months on tours of inspection during the year under report, the Superintendent did not inspect all the hospitals in his charge, and several districts, in all of which touring veterinary assistants are working, were not visited by him at all. The effect of this appears to be reflected in some of the figures referred to in this report. In two years' time the number of recruits received from the Madras Veterinary College should be about 25 per annum so that in a very few years the staff will be doubled, and each year the number of men not inspected by the Superintendent will become greater. Government have recently decided however that a second Sunerin- tendent is not necessary in this Presidency at present. F. WARE, Supt., Civil Veterinary Dept ., Madras.

It is difficult to see how, at present any way, their loss to the college could have been prevented in fairness to themselves, but it will be un- fortunate for the college, if it must lose men after they have gained experience in their work and have arrived at a stage when they are most valuable as teachers, especially hard would it be, in cases where men have been specializing for years to teach in certain subjects. Mr. H. C. Sampathu Ayyangar, senior lecturer, was transferred to the Civil Veterinary Department as Deputy Superintendent on 14th August 1915. Mr. V. Krishnamurthi was confirmed second lecturer and promoted to senior lecturer on probation for 12 months. Mr. A. J. Wilson who was third lecturer on probation and who would have been recommended for confirmation in his appointment and promotion to second lecturer was transferred to the Agricultural College, Coimbatore, on the 24th June 1915 to succeed Mr. S. L. D'Silva. To fill up the vacancy caused by the transfer of Mr. Wilson, the services of Mr. M. Anant Narayan Rao who belonged to the Coorg Administration were applied for and he joined duty on 22nd August 1915. Meantime, Mr. Muniappah, House Surgeon, was appointed third lecturer, sub. pro tem. in addition to his own work, and as the senior lecturer was transferred to the Civil Veterinary Department on the 14th August 1915, Mr. Muniappah continued his temporary appointment as a lecturer until the 3rd December 1915, when Mr. A. Ramachandra Ayyar, second-grade Veterinary Assistant in the Civil Veterinary Department was appointed third lecturer on probation. Simultaneously with this appointment, Mr. Anant Narayan Rao was promoted to second lecturer on probation. During the year under review, Government have revised the scale of pay of the second and third lecturers in order to permit of the interchange of Veterinary Inspectors with the staff of the college. The second and third lecturers are graded with first and second-grade Veterinary Inspectors and are allowed a local allowance of Rs. 20 each per mensem. The number of annual admissions into the college has been increased from 30 to 40 for the next five years by G.O. P. No 130, Revenue, dated 21st January 1916, in which they also sanctioned the employment of an additional lecturer to what the staff was when the number of admissions annually was only 20. Sanction has since been applied for for the employment of two assistant lecturers instead of the one lecturer which Government sanctioned and it has been obtained. 2.

Applications had been received from 99 fully qualified men, of whom 58 presented themselves for selection. Of these, 46 were temporarily selected, being the full complement of 30+16 provisional men, and they included 1 graduate, 1 F.A., 1 Matric, 1 Cambridge Senior and it School Finals. Twelve of the provisionally selected men, the one graduate and the F.A. did not attend after selection. The Government Order raising the number of admittances from 30 to 40 was not received until the 27th January 1916 and could not therefore be given full effect to, this year. There were 11 students who had failed in their first professional examination in December 1915 of whom, two having failed only in one minor subject in which they passed at a supplemental examination were allowed to join class B and one was permitted to resign. Therefore, the class at the end of March 1916, consisted of 32 new men and 8 failed students. 3. Professional examinations.20 " We consider that, in future, instruction in shoeing should include the remo- val of shoes and the preparation of the foot. This would involve a longer time being allotted for the examination in the subject." In conformity with the Board of Examiners' remarks on horse shoeing, arrangements have been made with the farrier in charge of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals forge to give the students practical instruction, and Government have sanctioned him a remuneration of Rs. 15 per mensem. 4. Employment of graduates.21 During the year 424 specimens (276 bacteriological and 148 pathological) were examined and reported on. These specimens were supplied to the college as follows:22 3.The Madras Veterinary College.23 5.Diseases.24 II Proceedings of the Board of Revenue (R.S., Sur., L. Rds. and Agri.), Mis. No. 2318, dated 5th September 1916. The Hon'ble Mr. LL. E. BUCKLEY, Commissioner of Revenue Settlement, Survey, Land Recorde and Agriculture. Read25 from 28 to 38. In consequence, the staff of the college has been strengthened by the addition of two assistant lecturers. The results of the working of the college continue to be thoroughly satisfactory. 5. It is hoped that the experiment which is about to be tried of re-establishing at Tuticorin the quarantine depôt for cattle going to Ceylon will enable this arrange- ment, which is strongly advocated by those engaged in the export trade, to be made permanent. 6. The Government await the Board's proposals for increasing the cadre of veterinary inspectors and assistants, for providing increased hostel accommodation in the veterinary college and for securing an adequate number of Telugu students in the college. 7. Orders will issue in the Local and Municipal Department on the subject of (1) utilizing the services of veterinary assistants in municipalities for meat inspection at slaughter-houses, and (2) reserving power in leases or licences for holding weekly cattle fairs to close such fairs temporarily, whenever necessary. 8. The Government desire to express their appreciation of the good work done by Messrs. Aitchison and Ware and the officers of the department under their control during the year under review.

ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT MADRAS PRESIDENCY FOR 1916-1917. READ2 He attended the cattle and pony show held at Tiruppur and visited Ootaca- mund, Madanapalle, Palghat and Pollachi to select buildings for new veterinary dispensaries. He visited Coorg at the request of that Administration in connexion with the reorganization of the Coorg Veterinary department and accompanied Mr. A. W. Shilston, Assistant Bacteriologist, for a short time in Kistna and Guntur districts when that officer was investigating the possibility of introducing a new method of inoculation against rinderpest in this Presidesncy. Mr. Ware acted as examiner in (a) the subject of Veterinary Science at the examination of the Coimbatore Agricultural College in April 1916, (b) the promotion examination for veterinary assistants of the third grade of this department held in July 1916 and (c) the annual examinations of the Madras Veterinary College held in December 1916. M.R.Ry. H. C. Sampath Ayyangar Avargal held charge of the office of Deputy Superintendent throughout the year. He was on tour for 207 days and travelled 12,436 miles by rail, 1,044 miles by road and 403 miles by boat. He inspected all the hospitals and dispensaries except those at Bellary, Ad?ni, Nandyal, Hindupur, Madanapalle, Vellore. Ranipet, Tiruvann?malai, Erode, Coonoor, Cuddalore, Salem, Tanjore and Negapatam. The work of all the touring veterinary assistants in the Presidency including the additional veterinary assistants at Nellore, Bezwada, Bandar and Narasaraopet was inspected by him excepting those in Tanjore, South Arcot, Salem, The Nilgiris, North Arcot, Chittoor, Cuddapah, Anantapur, Bellary and Kurnool. He also inspected the office of all veterinary inspectors except that of the veteri- nary inspector, III Circle, the work of the veterinary assistants of the Mobile Corps, the Cattle Quarantine Depot at Tuticorin, Government bulls Nos. 1, 3, 15, 16, 18 and 22 and the Government elephants at Russellkonda and Parlakimedi. He visited Devakottai to report on the site selected for a veterinary dispensary and also Valluru in Kistna district to report on the suitability of the place for opening a dispensary. He was deputed to Amritsar to purchase country-bred stallions fur breeding operations in this Presidency and he accompanied Mr. Shilston, Assistant Bacteriolo- gist, in Kistna district during January 1917 during his investigations regarding rinderpest. He attended the annual cattle show at Tiruppur and the weekly cattle fairs at Ambajipet and Tudiyalur once. II.3 The Mobile Corps was working mostly in Godavari district till the middle of October when, owing to the severity of rinderpest in Guntur and Kistna, the corps was distributed in these two districts, providing at the same time three additional men for Godavari district. Additional Veterinary Assistants were also working during the year in Bellary, South Kanara, Cuddapah, Nellore, Kistna, Guntur, Chingleput and Salem. Anthrax.4 III.5 when the additional Deputy Superintendent whose appointment has recently been gazetted assumes charge, the office of each will consist of two clerks and a portion of the routine work of the Superintendent's office will be transferred to their offices. V.6 (viii) Owing to the late receipt of the order of Government sanctioning the holding of a class for compounders at the Madras Veterinary College during the vacation of 1916, some District Boards who had expressed their willingness to send candidates for training were unable to do so. Four men however joined the class, of whom one left of his own accord, one was found unfit at the end of the course and two came out successful in the examination. (ix) Government in the Local and Municipal Department were pleased to com- mend to all Municipal Councils for consideration the suggestion that where veterinary assistants are available, municipalities concerned may usefully employ them to a larger extent than at present for the inspection of meat. As a result of this, enquiries were received from several municipalities on the subject. Many of the Municipal Councils that contribute towards the maintenance of hospitals hold the opinion that as they incur a portion of the charges, the veterinary assistants in charge of such hospitals should do the work without remuneration. Meat inspection does not form part of a veterinary assistant's legitimate duties and it seems therefore unfair to order him to do it without remuneration. The places where this work is now carried on by veterinary assistants are Coimbatore, Erode, Berhampur, Calicut, Parlakimedi, Guntur, Coonoor and Adoni. (x) During the year the Mobile corps was disbanded and the six assistants comprising the corps and seven more men were posted to taluks along the Hyderabad border. The number of permanent touring assistants has thus been increased from 29 to 42. A new Inspector's circle was formed and the Inspector of the corps was placed in charge of it. It is expected that the need for the Mobile corps will not be felt as several men have been posted to taluks in the frontier districts. (xi) During the year materials in connection with 88 cases of suspected animal poisoning were examined by the Chemical Examiner and poison was detected in 53 cases. According to figures available, 59 cases of criminal poisoning were dealt with by the magistracy and police. The accused in 24 cases were convicted and in 9 dis- charged. Sixteen cases are reported to be undetected, 4 were struck off as mistake of fact and six are reported to be pending. Figures relating to Kurnool have not been furnished. (xii) The question of increasing the sanctioned strength of the department has been taken up by Government. (xiii) A manual for the guidance of the subordinate staff is under compilation. D. A. D. AITCHISON, I.C.V.D., Acting Supt., Civil Veterinary Dept., Madras.

Ramana Rao, Veterinary Assistant in charge of the District Board Veterinary Hospital, Saidapet, were appointed to the two posts on the 14th and 20th July 1916 respectively but were reverted to the Department on 9th September 1916 and 16th January 1917. These appointments were then filled by Mr. M. A. Rangasawmy Ayyar, b.a., who had meanwhile become house surgeon, and by Mr. H. N. Cheluva Ayyangar. Mr. P. Sreenivasa Rao became house surgeon on 9th September 1916, He was given three months' privilege leave on medical certificate from 23rd December 1916 and was transferred back to the Civil Veterinary Department. The appoint- ment was then filled by Mr. M. S. Sastry. 3. Selection of candidates.17 Bezwada men joined the college, and when the new roll was called, it consisted of Telugus 32, Uriyas 3, Tamils and others 49, giving a total of 84 probationary students from which the new class would be formed. By the end of March 1917, the new class had formed into the following:18 " At present the time allotted for the subject 'Pharmacy' is only 10 minutes. This is a practical subject including dispensing and we consider the time should be extended to 20 minutes." Government approved of all the suggestions made by the Board of Examiners in their Order Mis. No. 244, Revenue, dated 26th January 1917, and arrangements are being made accordingly. Promotion examinations.19 Details of the specimens submitted by the Civil Veterinary Department.20 II Letter21 5.The fall in the number of castrations performed both by touring veterinary assistants and at hospitals and dispensaries is not satisfactory. The Superintendent will be requested to invite the attention of all veterinary assistants to G.O. No. 1494, dated the 25th May 1917, directing that cattle shall be treated and bulls castrated free of charge, and to impress on his subordinates that the Government expect better results in the current year. 6.The Government recognize that the department is gravely in need of more supervising officers. A second Superintendent has been sanctioned by the Secretary of State, but the recruitment of this officer must be deferred till the end of the war. A second Deputy Superintendent has been appointed, and the division of the Presi- dency into two circles, each in charge of a Deputy Superintendent, has been approved. The Government hope that this arrangement will afford the Superintend- ent such relief as will enable him to concentrate attention where it is most needed. 7.Only two veterinary institutions (the hospital at Mangalore and the dispen- sary at Madanapalle) were opened during the year. Proposals for institutions at Ootacamund, Kumbakonam, Devakottai, Pollachi, Palghat and Cuddapah have been sanctioned. The question of accelerating the opening of veterinary institutions to keep pace with the number of students who graduate annually at the Veterinary College is under consideration and orders on the subject will issue shortly. 8.The thanks of the Government are due to the Zamindar of Devakottai who, in addition to the grant of a site of two acres for the construction of a veterinary dispensary, has undertaken to construct the building at his own cost and to make an annual grant of Rs, 200 for its maintenance. The Government welcome the co-oper- ation of the Zamindaris of Uttumalai, Kangundi and Valluru in the task of rendering veterinary aid accessible to the agricultural classes by the establishment of estate hospitals. 9.The attention of the District Magistrate, Trichinopoly, will be invited to the remarks of the Superintendent in regard to the failure of the magistracy to make use of the provisions of section 6 (3) of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1890, and he will be requested to issue the necessary instructions to all magistrates in accordance with the orders issued in paragraph 3 of G.O. No. 1088, Judicial, dated the 1st May 1916. 10.The Superintendent is requested to submit a separate report regarding the remuneration he proposes to give to the veterinary assistants in charge of hospitals for meat and milk inspection. 11.The work done by the Veterinary College continued to be satisfactory. 12.The total charges of the department as reported by the Accountant-General (excluding charges on account of breeding operations and the inspection of cattle for export to Ceylon) amount to Rs. 2,07,244-322 of veterinary work to Government and Local Funds during the year was Rs. 2,42,196-8-10, of which Rs. 2,03,035-2-6 represents the net cost to the Government. 13. The Government congratulate Mr. Ware on the efficient discharge of his heavy responsibilities in spite of ill-health and Mr. Aitchison on the successful working of the College. (True extract) A. R.

ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT MADRAS PRESIDENCY FOR 1917-1918 READ2 end of the year he held the office of Deputy Superintendent, Southern Circle, with headquarters at Madras. During the year he spent 204 days on tour, travelled 7,253 miles by rail, and 1,569 by road. 4. M.R.Ry. R. Narasinga Rao Avargal, on return from taking a post-graduate course at the Lahore Veterinary College, was posted as Deputy Superintendent, Northern circle, with headquarters at Bezwada, on probation for one year. He took charge on 1st August 1917 and remained in office until the close of the year. While in charge of this office he was on tour for 154 days, travelled 3,056 miles by rail, 489 by road and 297 by boat. The touring and inspection work of both these officers was satisfactory, but their charges have now become too large to be controlled efficiently. Proposals for increasing the number of circles have been sanctioned by Government. II.3 12. It will be seen that Berhampur heads the list of hospitals, Rajahmundry running it a close second, while the dispensary at Tinnevelly also has very creditable figures. Other institutions which have done well during the year are Amalapuram, Parla- kimedi, Sivagiri and Negapatam. An outbreak of Foot and Mouth disease swelled the figures of the Sivagiri hospital but the following Assistants may be given the credit for the success of the other institutions mentioned:4 20.In horses the contagious diseases Glanders and Surra were much more prevalent than they have ever been reported to be before. There are no columns in the Cattle Mortality Register maintained by village officers in this Presidency for Glanders and Dourine and the figures of Surra reported by the village officers vary considerably from the real state of things ; so that, partly for this reason and partly because it is often found difficult to obtain correct figures of mortality from contagious diseases even in cattle in large towns through the Agency of village munsifs, Collectors have been asked their opinion as to the advisability of making it incumbent on municipalities, where such bodies exist, to report the outbreak of a contagious disease amongst animals within their limits. The result of the correspondence will be reported to Government when all replies have been received. 21.Rinderpest5 not admit of this being done to any extent at present but as a preliminary the Superintendent has been permitted by Government to visit Muktesar during the current year and study the technique of the operation. 27.After an extended trial in this Presidency it must be admitted that the 'serum alone' method of inoculation will not stamp out Rinderpest in this country, while the conditions under which it has to be used in the villages remain as they are. Nothing less than compulsory inoculation will give the serum a fair chance for in a typical village rarely as many as two-thirds of the cattle are produced for inocula- tion and although the staff has been instructed repeatedly to return to every village for purposes of re-inoculating those animals which have already been done the ryots get tired of producing them once a month and when the animals eventually contract the disease from some of the uninoculated ones, and perhaps die, the serum is blamed. The result may be that eventually the ryots of that and other adjacent villages lose faith in the serum, refuse inoculation and re-inoculation altogether, and the disease goes on as if this department had made no effort at all in the matter. 28.The other recommendations made by Mr. Shilston have been adopted as far as possible. The staff reports that ryots as a rule refuse absolutely to allow the nostrils of inoculated animals to be smeared with infective discharges. A leaflet on Rinderpest has recently been written by the Superintendent and is now being translated into the vernaculars and maps showing the routes taken by cattle to and from the Native States of Hyderabad and Mysore are under preparation. 29.Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia.6 of planters and other enlightened people. Those animals which have been done so far in this Presidency have for the most part been the property of Europeans and they have been quite satisfied with the results, 34.Foot-and-Mouth disease.7 Four were sold, one was destroyed, one given to the villagers of Oddavelli. Sattenapalle taluk, Guntur district, at their own request, and one to the Rev. J. A. Curtis, Missionary, Donakonda, for stud purposes. In last year's report it was stated that Government had accepted the Superintendent's proposal to postpone further consideration of the question of pony-breeding operations owing to the impossibility of securing suitable stallions. 47. Thus it becomes necessary to write an obituary notice on a branch of the work of this department to which Government have contributed much money and the officials of this and the Revenue departments have given much time. It is with regret that one has to record the fact that these operations have been a failure. Several causes have probably contributed to this but chief among them have been the lack of interest in and knowledge of the principles of breeding on sound lines which are displayed by the majority of the people of this Presidency, and the inability of this department, owing to smallness of staff, to do any educative work on the subject. 48. There was never any real demand for the Government stud animals maintained by this department and while the people themselves take so little interest in this subject the present Superintendent, although he is keenly interested in it himself and would welcome requests for help and advice in the matter, considers that the energies of the department, instead of being dissipated in what after all is only a side line in its activities, are better employed on purely Veterinary work, the demand for which still exceeds the amount which the present staff is able to supply. 49.

To accelerate the rate of establishment of veterinary institutions, the Govern- ment have instructed the Superintendent to submit aunually a list of six places where institutions can be opened in the next but one succeeding financial year. The Government hope that the delay which has hitherto occurred in starting work at the places where the opening of institutions has been sanctioned will be obviated and that at least six institutions will in future be regularly opened every year. 6. The number of castrations performed at hospitals and dispensaries shows a satisfactory increase during the year. Six hundred and fifty-six castrations were performed in 1914-15,1,505 in 1915-16, 816 in 1916-17 and 1,439 in the year under review. Taking in and out-patients together, the most noticeable decrease in attendance was at Bellary, Hindupur and Saidapet. The Government note the good work done at Tinnevelly and Rajahmundry, while at Berhampur, Sivagiri, Nellore, Parl25 9. Glanders (from which this Presidency has hitherto been free) made its appearance during the year and a special officer has been appointed to investigate the disease in the city of Madras. 10. The attention of Collectors is invited to paragraph 24 of the Superintendent's report and they are requested to give effect to his suggestion in regard to the closing of cattle fairs and markets during the prevalence of rinderpest in their districts. Their attention is further invited to paragraph 70 of the report and they are requested to see that slackness in reporting outbreaks of cattle disease is suitably dealt with. 11. The Government regret to note that, notwithstanding the instructions in G.O. No. 1088, Judicial, dated 1st May 1916, many of the cases convicted under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act were not sent to the veterinary hospitals for treatment. The Government desire District Magistrates to enjoin on the subordinate magistracy the necessity of making full use of the provisions of section 6 (3) of the Act. 12. The total charges of the department as reported by the Accountant-General (exclusive of charges on account of breeding operations and establishment for the inspection of cattle to Ceylon) amounted to Rs. 2,32,424-8-2, as shown below:AGENTS FOR THE SALE OF MADRAS GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS IN INDIA BUTTERWORTH & Co.

ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT MADRAS PRESIDENCY FOR 1918-1919 READ2 (b) Deputy Superintendents. 3. At the beginning of the year under report there were two Deputy- Superintendents' Circles, but these were increased to four in G.O. Mis. No. 2604, dated 11th July 1918, with headquarters at Vizagapatam, Bellary, Madras, and Coimbatore respectively. 4. M.R.Ry. R. Narasinga Rao Avargal was in charge of the old Northern Circle from the beginning of the year until 17th September 1918, and from that date until the end of the year of the new I Circle. During the year he spent 211 days on tour, travelled 4,103 miles by rail, 850 miles by road and 414 by boat. He was confirmed in the Deputy Superintendent's grade with effect from 1st August 1917. 5. M.R.Ry. H. C. Sampathu Ayyangar Avargal was in charge of the old Southern Circle from 1st April 1918 until the afternoon of 16th July 1918, when he proceeded on privilege leave. On expiry of the leave he was posted to the new II Circle, of which he assumed charge on 23rd September 1918, and continued in that post until the end of the year. Altogether during the year he was on tour for 158 days, travelled 4,870 miles by rail, and 1,090 miles by road. 6. Mr. A. J. Wilson was appointed Deputy Superintendent on probation for one year and assumed charge of the III Circle on the afternoon of 30th September 1918. He continued in this charge until the end of the year and in that period he toured for 117 days, covering 2,202 miles by rail and 810 by road. 7. M.R.Ry. K. Kylasam Ayyar Avargal was appointed as Deputy Superintendent on probation for one year from 24th August 1918. He acted for M.R.Ry. H. C. Sampathu Ayyangar Avargal in the old Southern Circle from 16th July to 30th September 1918, and then held charge of the new IV Circle from 9th October 1918 until the end of the year. While working as a Deputy Superintendent he spent 150 days on tour, travelled 4,285 miles by rail and 997 by road. II.3 at Kuppam on 2nd February 1919. This latter is being visited by the inspecting officers of this department, at the Zamindar's request, so it is included in Table V, which now contains 42 institutions compared with 39 of the previous year. The question of a site for the Ootacamund hospital has at last been decided and Govern- ment have ordered the buildings to be constructed at an early date. After much delay in the matter of obtaining buildings and furniture, the dispensaries at Cuddapah and Bezwada have recently been opened. It is reported that buildings for a Veteri- nary hospital to be opened at Veerakeralampudur in Uttumalai estate will soon be ready, but the Zamindar of South Vallur says he is not willing to open such an institution on his estate. 13. It is difficult to compare, at a glance, the figures of work done at a hospital during the past year with those of previous years because Table V has been prepared in this report in a new form, according to the instructions contained in the Circular of the Government of India No. 1061-36, dated 21st September 1917. It will be observed that Calicut now goes to the top of the tree, although Berhampur continued to do the most work if castrations be included. The other institutions which show a considerable increase, if the complete figures are taken into account, are Nellore, Trichinopoly, Saidapet, Ad4 (ii) Itinerating. 19. There were 43 permanent touring assistants' billets in existence during the year, but that of the Touring Veterinary Assistant, Nugur, was vacant after the death of the assistant in charge on 18th November 1918. The following table shows a comparison between the main work performed by the whole touring staff of this department for the year under report and the year previous to it:5 into the Nilgiris several times but the Madras Cattle Disease Act was in force there throughout the year and this, together with the fact that the people there are more amenable to control than in the plains, enabled the department to enforce complete segregation of the infected animals and carry out inoculation of the in-contacts, thus stamping out each outbreak in a very short time. The same successful results were obtained during the outbreak which occurred at Kodaik6 84. Foot and mouth disease.7 The yellow oleander, or its active principle thevetin, accounted for 27 of the cases, while arsenic was found in 16 of them. 49.

The District Magistrates of G?d?vari, Madura, Tanjore, Trichinopoly and Bellary are requested to see that officers under them pay more attention to the repeated instructions of the Government in the matter. 7. The Government have not considered it necessary to amend the Madras Cattle Disease Act, 1866, as proposed by the Superintendent in paragraph 55 of his report. They are of opinion that the object in view, viz., the proper disposal of carcasses of animals dying of a contagious disease, can be attained by the issue of by-laws under section 18 of the Act and have accordingly issued a by-law to that effect. 8. Plans and estimates for providing accommodation for twenty additional students in the hostel attached to the Madras Veterinary College are under scrutiny. 9.

ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT MADRAS PRESIDENCY 1919-1920 MADRAS PRINTED BY THE SPPERINTEDENT GOVERNMENT PRESS 1921
ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT MADRAS PRESIDENCY FOR 1919-1920 READ2 In addition to inspecting the staff and Government live-stock in his circle, he visited several towns for the purpose of deciding whether they were suitable for the opening of a veterinary dispensary, and also collected material from eases of bovine lymphangitis for the Director of the Imperial Bacteriological Laboratory, Ritani. 4. M.R.Ry. H. C. Sampath Ayyangar Avargal held charge of the II Circle for the same period. He was 214 days in camp, travelled 6,049 miles by rail, and 1,043 miles by road. He carried out most of the necessary routine inspections, but a great deal of his time was taken up in investigating the causes of the heavy morta- lity amongst sheep and lambs at the agricultural farms at Hagari and Bantanahal in Bellary district. 5. Mr. A. J. Wilson held charge of the III Circle during the whole period under report. He was on tour for 219 days and travelled 4,163 miles by rail and 1,661 by road. He inspected all the subordinate staff in his circle, in several cases more than once, and in addition successfully performed the duties of Editor of the Madras Veterinary Journal. He was confirmed in his appointment with effect from 1st October 1918. 6. M.R.Ry. K. Kylasam Ayyar Avargal was in charge of the IV Circle through- out the year. He spent 176 days in camp, during which time he travelled 5,167 miles by rail and 1,156 by road. He was in charge for more than a month of the Serum Simultaneous inoculations against Rinderpest at the Agricultural Farm at Coimbatore, his headquarters; hence the smaller number of days spent in camp. All the subordinate offices in his circle were inspected during the year at least once. He was confirmed as Deputy Superintendent with effect from 24th August 1918. II.3 In addition, a Veterinary hospital was opened in November 1919 at Vira- keralampudur in the Uttumalai estate and a Veterinary Assistant of this department lent to be in charge of it. The figures of the Veterinary hospital attached to the Coimbatore Agricultural Farm have been included in Table V for the first time this year. 11. As there are now 51 veterinary institutions open in the Presidency, exclud- ing the Madras Veterinary College hospital, Table V has been arranged in this report by districts, as is done in the other large provinces. By doing this, readers of this report are prevented from comparing the figures of any particular institution for the year under review with those of previous years, but it seems necessary to make this alteration in future reports for the sake of economy. 12. Owing to a large increase in the number of cruelty cases sent for treatment by the Magistrates, the hospital at Trichinopoly takes first place during the past year with 2,454 admissions, excluding castrations. Other institutions which show an appreciable increase over the previous year's figures are:4 It will be observed that there is a considerable increase in the number of cases treated and castrations performed on tour, while there is a decrease in the number of inoculations done. The number of Rinderpest reports received was less than in 1918-19, but more inoculations would have been performed against this disease if serum could have been obtained in the quantities indented for. 22. The following touring assistants are mentioned for good work:5 produce their animals for reinoculation whenever required. It is found that owners have no objection to give this written promise, but when the time comes to fulfil it they refuse to do so and the Veterinary Assistant has no power to enforce it. 30. During the year a beginning was made in this Presidency with "Serum Simultaneous" inoculations against Rinderpest. Sixty-nine animals belonging to the Agricultural Farm at Coimbatore were subjected to the process with no fatalities, and it is believed that all these animals now have a permanent immunity to the disease. It is hoped that it will be possible to make arrangements to protect the young stock and new purchases at this Farm annually in future by this method, and possibly also some animals belonging to private owners living in the neighbourhood. In this way the method may become popular amongst cattle-owners generally and demands for it arise in other centres. 31. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia.6 The Veterinary Assistant in charge of the Veterinary Hospital, Gunt7 prosecutions were made, but in only seven of them were convictions obtained. This is a very small percentage of the total number of positive cases certified by the Chemical Examiner. 53. Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.--From the figures received in this office it appears that 3,549 convictions were obtained under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act in this Presidency, excluding Madras City, during the last official year, and in 1,035 eases the animals concerned were sent to Veterinary infirmaries for treatment. This is a distinct advance on the previous year, but matters are not yet what they should be, particularly in G8 department, except those relating to the Quarantine Depot at Tuticorin, and breeding operations, under which there was no expenditure by this department last year. VI.9 7 4. In writing the section on 'Contagious diseases' endeavours have been made to show how often the number of deaths from a certain disease reported from a particular district bears no comparison with the number of outbreak reports received by the staff of this department, as of course it should do. During the past year village officers appear to have been more slack than usual in reporting outbreaks of disease, for the itinerating staff made 287 reports against them, as compared with 230 the previous year. 75. In spite of the fact that for half the year there was only one Imperial Veterinary officer in this Presidency, the figures given in this report show that not only has it been possible to carry on efficiently under these conditions but in most directions an actual increase in the amount of work done is recorded. A great deal of the credit for this should be given to the four Deputy Superintendents, who have all rendered most loyal help to the Superintendent during a difficult time. Now that the War is over, if sufficient inducement is offered in the matter of pay, it should soon be possible to bring the Imperial staff up to the requirements of this Presidency. A second Superintendent has recently arrived, a third one has been sanctioned by the Secretary of State, and proposals are at present with Government for the appointment of a fourth Imperial officer, to take the place of the officer appointed to the Directorship, which post is now considered a necessity to take charge of the whole of the veterinary work in this Presidency.

After that he was attached to this office again until 23rd January 1922 when he opened the new Superintendent's office at Vizagapatam, but on 28th March 1922 he resigned his appointment in this department to take up private practice in Bombay. He handed over charge of the Vizagapatam office to Mr, Narasinga Rao, the Deputy Superintendent, I Circle, who has had to carry on the work of both this and his own office for over three months. (c) Deputy Superintendents. 5. The four Deputy Superintendents' circles were held throughout the year by the same officers as in the previous year. As usual, their routine work was all that could be desired and it is necessary only to mention items of special work performed by each. 6. Mr. Sampath Ayyangar was in executive charge of the "Serum Simultaneous" inoculations against Rinderpest at the Chintaldevi Agricultural Farm, he was respon- sible for the despatch of a large amount of material from the Bantanahal Sheep Farm to the Muktesar Laboratory and investigated two different obscure conditions which were observed in buffaloes in Bellary and Kurnool districts during the year. Mr. Kylasam Ayyar was in executive charge of the "Serum Simultaneous" inoculations at the Coimbatore Agricultural Farm, and he also acted as an examiner of the Final year students of the Certificate course at the College of the same name.

ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT MADRAS PRESIDENCY FOR 1922-23 READ2 4. Mr. T. J. Hurley, who arrived from England on 6th April 1922, was under training in the head office until 28th March 1923. when he took charge of the office of Superintendent, 1 Division, Vizagapatam. He was on tour for 47 days, travelling 3,594 miles by rail and 232 by road. From July to December 1922 he was attached to the Madras Veterinary College to help with the post-graduate class and acted as an Examiner at the end of it, and daring January and March 1923 he conducted serum simultaneous inoculations at Coimbatore and in the Nilgiris. (b) Provincial Officers. 5. Mr. H. C. Sampath Ayyangar held charge of the II Circle, Bellary, through- out the year and spent 159 days on tour. The investigation by the Muktesar Laboratory of the peculiar form of pleuro- pneumonia prevalent amongst sheep at the Bantanahal and Hagari Farms was continued with his aid. 6. Mr. R. Narasinga Rao was in charge of the I Circle, Vizagapatam, throughout the year except for a period of three months from 14th August 1922, when Mr. W. J. D'Costa acted for him. In addition, he held charge of the office of Superintendent, I Division, from the beginning of the year until 8th July 1922, when Mr. Saunders arrived to take charge. Mr. Narasinga Rao toured for 102 days and Mr. D'Costa for 39 days in the I Circle during the year. 7. Mr. K. Kailasam Ayyar held charge of the IV Circle, Coimbatore, during the whole year and spent 168 days in camp. He attended the cattle and pony Show at Tiruppur and served as an Examiner in Animal Hygiene at the Diploma Examination of the Coimbatore Agricultural College. S. Mr. A. J. Wilson was in charge of the III Circle, Madras, throughout the year and was on tour for 143 days. He continued also to act as Editor of the Madras Veterinary Journal. II.3 (i) Hospitals and Dispensaries. 12. Two new veterinary institutions were opened during the year, a dispensary at Tiruppur and a hospital at Ootacamund, and both have made a good start. 13. In the following institutions a marked decrease in the amount of work done is observed:4 22. The following Touring Assistants are mentioned for good work :5 to induce the ordinary ryots to have their animals protected against this disease which is very sudden in onset, but the Pattagar of Palayakottai set a good example by having 256 of his calves vaccinated with Blacklegoids and another 146 were done, at the Chintaladevi Cattle Farm. 82. Foot-and-mouth disease.6 45. The Veterinary Inspector of the range concerned brings to notice a serious state of affairs in Tuticorin. It is said that since the abolition of the Cattle Quaran- tine Depot, which was previously maintained there by this department, a great deal of cruelty is being perpetrated while loading cattle and sheep for Colombo. The local Chamber of Commerce is said to have asked for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act to be enforced, but it is difficult to administer this while no veterinary infirmary exists in the town. 46. Municipal7 (b) Parasitology and protozoology. (c) Preventive medicine and clinical diagnostics. 54. A notification was issued during the year by the Government of India prohibiting the taking by sea of Ongole cattle from any port in the Madras Presidency to any place beyond the limits of British India. 55. The proposal to open a serum-making laboratory in the south of India has been postponed for the present owing to lack of funds. 56. In their order on last year's annual report Government called for a report on the question of contagious diseases in the northern districts like Ganjam and Kistna, which are badly affected every your. It was submitted that to combat these more effectively the following are required : 8 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OP THE MADRAS VETERINARY COLLEGE FOR THE YEAR 1922-23. General Administration.9 5.

No. 1278, Development, dated 25th September 1922, the Chief Superintendent was asked to report what special steps should be taken to combat contagious diseases on a more effective scale in these and other districts which are badly affected every year. The three measures he suggested were the prompt reporting of disease by village officers, the strengthen- ing of the itinerating staff of the department and the provision of a peon for each itinerating officer. The Government are glad to see that the work of village officers in regard to the reporting of cattle disease has given much less cause for complaint than in previous years and trust that the improvement will be maintained. As stated in paragraph 2 above, the touring staff was strengthened during the year by the addition of six veterinary assistants. Further additions can only be made as funds permit. The need for providing peons for touring assistants has been accepted by Government, and permanent peons have been sanctioned for 34 of them whilst for the remainder the employment of local men for particular duties whenever necessary has been authorized. 5. The assistants in charge of veterinary institutions performed 2,643 castrations and treated 78,234 cases during the year, the corresponding figures for the previous year being 2,617 and 72,969. The figures would have been even better had it not been for a marked fall in the work done in fifteen institutions. The Government agree with the Chief Superintendent that the popularity and usefulness of a veteri- nary institution depend upon the personality of the officer in charge of it more than on anything else and would point out that it is for the superior officers of the department to take suitable action to keep the personal element up to the mark. The number of cases supplied with medicine but not brought to veterinary institutions fell by nearly 50 per cent. The Chief Superintendent has not commented on this and the Government would be glad to know if there was any special reason for it. In G.O. No. 287, L. & M., dated 31st January 1923, it was suggested that, in order to remove the hardship caused by the levy of daily tolls on unladen sick animals which have to pass through local fund and municipal toll gates to attend veterinary institutions for treatment, district boards and municipal councils should sanction the exemption of persons bringing animals for treatment at veterinary institutions as a class from payment of tolls. The Government regret to observe that this suggestion has so far only been acted on by the district boards of Madura and Malabar and would again express the hope that district boards and municipal councils will see their way to adopt this method of removing difficulties in the way of such animals being treated at veterinary institutions. 6. The work of the itinerating staff during 1922-23 compares as follows with that of the last five years :22 7. The model by-laws relating to the maintenance of cattle mortality registers were adopted by twelve more municipal councils bringing the total up to 34. The Government trust that the remaining councils will take early steps to introduce the by-laws, the importance of which in enabling the Veterinary Department to deal promptly with outbreaks of contagious diseases has been pointed out on several occasions. 8. The improvement noticed last year in the number of cases sent to veterinary infirmaries by subordinate magistrates under se3tion 6 (3) of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1890, has not been maintained. The necessity for making full use of the provisions of the section has often been emphasized but there is still great disinclination on the part of the magistracy to use the powers conferred on them by the Act, The Government are therefore constrained again to request District Magistrates to draw the attention of their subordinate magistrates to this matter and to satisfy themselves periodically that advantage is being taken of the provisions of the Act. The District Magistrate of Trichinopoly is requested to report the circum- stances in which 316 animals only out of the 2,335 in respect of which convictions were obtained in Trichinopoly were sent to the local hospital during 1922-23. A veterinary institution has now been sanctioned for Tuticorin and the obstacle to the introduction of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act in that municipality has thus been removed. 9. The Madras Veterinary College continued to do satisfactory work and the results of the examinations held in March 1923 were slightly better than in the previous year. A refresher course was held for the first time during the year and was attended by eight veterinary inspectors of whom two came from Bihar and Orissa. 10. Since the close of the year orders have issued on the recommendations of the Retrenchment Committee which are referred to by the Chief Superintendent in paragraph 58 of his report. The most important recommendations of the Committee were that the inspectors' grade should be abolished and the payment of stipends to students entering the college should be discontinued. The first of these has been accepted in its entirety, but a selection grade of veterinary assistants consisting of ten posts on Rs. 125AGENTS FOR THE SALE OF MADRAS GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS IN INDIA BUTTERWORTH & Co.

He arranged for and conducted serum simultaneous inoculations against Rinderpest on 133 head of cattle belonging to private gentlemen at Samalkot, Bobbili and Mandasa and served as an Examiner for the Madras post-graduate course and the annual professional examinations of the Madras and Bengal Veterinary Colleges. (b) Officers of the Madras Veterinary Service. 5.M.R.Ry. H. C. Sampath Ayyangar Avargal was in charge of the old II Circle, Bellary, up to 1st November 1923 and the new III Circle, Bellary, from that date to the end of the year. He was on tour for 188 days. In addition to his inspection work, he treated 14 cases of Nasal granuloma with tartar emetic injec- tion, protected 25 animals against Rinderpest at the Hagari Farm by the serum simultaneous method of inoculation and vaccinated 46 animals against Black-quarter in Chittoor district. 6.M.R.Ry. R. Narasinga Rao Avargal held charge of the old I Circle, Vizaga- patam, till 1st November 1923 when he proceeded to Bezwada to open the new II Circle and held charge of it till the end of the year. During the year he was in camp for 126 days. When proposals were made to Government for the re-arrange- ment of circles in accordance with the recommendations of the Retrenchment Committee, arrangements were made for this officer to tour only in Kistna district in the old 1 Circle and for Mr. Hurley to tour in the remaining districts of this circle until both of them assumed charge of their respective re-formed circles. For this reason it was not necessary for the former officer to spend a larger number of days in camp. He inoculated 62 animals against Rinderpest by the serum simultaneous method at the Chintaladevi Cattle Farm. 7.M.R.Ry. K. Kailasam Ayyar Avargal held charge of the V Circle (old IV Circle), Coimbatore, throughout the year. He spent only 138 days in camp on account of it being necessary for him in January and February 1924 to remain at head- quarters to conduct the serum simultaueous method of inoculation at the Agricultural Farm at Coimbatore. He atteuded the cattle and pony show at Tiruppur and supervised the Black-quarter vaccination of young stock at the Palayakottai Farm. 8.Mr. A. J. Wilson was in charge of the IV Circle (old III Circle), Madras. The rearrangement of circles necessitated no change in his jurisdiction. This officer has the largest number of Veterinary Assistant Surgeons to control and it was necessary for him to be in camp for 204 days. He continued to be the Editor of the Madras Veterinary Journal. II.3 12. The following institutions show a decrease in the number of in and out- patients treated when compared with the figures of the previous year:4 20. A comparison of the work done in the last two years by the touring staff is- shown below:5 means of Black Legoid vaccination and another 46 animals were done in Chittoor district. With the means at our disposal up to the present, in order to protect animals against this disease, it has been essential that animals treated should be so done a month before the recurring annual outbreak, i.e., before the disease actually exists, because inoculation must not be carried out in the presence of the disease. It has been found almost impossible to get the ryots to submit their young stock for this protective vaccination before an expected outbreak in black-quarter areas and so preventive measures against this disease have not made much headway. The Director of the Bacteriological Laboratory, Muktesar, is now manufacturing two new substances, viz., a germ free filtrate and an anti-serum for inoculations against this disease. The latter may safely be used during an outbreak and although it gives immunity for only a fortnight, that is sufficiently long to prevent infection during the time the animals remain on the infected land and will thus be of use in preventing deaths. During an outbreak, therefore, the ryots will more readily accept inoculation of their animals, 30. Foot-and-mouth disease.--The mortality under this head shows considerable decrease, the number being 1,278 against 2,403 in the preceding year. Vizagapatam and Ganj6 number of cases prosecuted was 7 of which 3 were discharged, 2 treated as un- detected, 1 is pending and one of the accused in the remaining ease was sentenced to six months' rigorous imprisonment. 42. In the whole Presidency, excluding Madras City, 4,312 convictions were obtained under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act XI of 1890, of which 2,316 related to Trichinopoly. Altogether the number sent to veterinary infirmaries for treatment was only 617. The reason assigned by the District Magistrate, Trichi- nopoly, for the small number sent to the local hospital for treatment during the year 1922-23 was that a large Dumber of cases were dealt with for offences such as carrying birds with the legs tied and head downwards, using needle-sticks while driving, over-loading, using weak and poor conditioned animals, tying horns to fetlocks, biting tail, etc. This perhaps accounts also for the small number sent to infirmaries throughout the Presidency during the year under report. 43. Municipal.7 52. The second post-graduate course for the staff of this department was held at the Madras Veterinary College for six months from 2nd July 1923. Seven Veterinary Assistant Surgeons were deputed to attend and five were successful at the concluding examination. 53.

Table V.15 Table VI.16 Table XIII.17 Table XIV.18 Table XIV-A.19 the Indian Veterinary Service designated Superintendent whilst the remainder of the Presidency was in direct charge of the Chief Superintendent. Each division was split up into two circles in charge of Deputy Superintendents. The Retrench- ment Committee were of opinion that distinction between the work of Superintend- ents and that of Deputy Superintendents was unnecessary and that the Presidency should he divided into circles, each of which should be in charge of a Deputy Director working directly under the Chief Superintendent. The Committee's re- commendation was accepted by Government and, with effect from 1st November, the first division was abolished and the four circles were reconstituted into five. The fourth circle, comprising as it does seven districts, is still a somewhat unwieldy charge especially as its headquarters cannot conveniently be located elsewhere than at Madras which is situated in a corner of it. In these circumstances, the Govern- ment have under consideration the question of a further division of the fourth and fifth circles into three. 3. The Retrenchment Committee also recommended the abolition of the grade of Veterinary Inspectors as it considered that, although inspection by these officers served a useful purpose in preventing waste of medicines and misuse and loss of instruments, the saving in this direction did not compensate for the increased ex- penditure necessitated by the appointment of inspectors and that inspection by a Deputy Superintendent only should be sufficient. This recommendation was also accepted and the change was brought into force in June 1923, a selection grade of Veterinary Assistants comprising ten appointments on Rs. 12520 7. The following statement shows the work done in 1923-24 of the touring Veterinary Assistants, the staff of which was increased by three during the year as compared with that of the previous five years. 1918-19. 1919-20. 1920-21. 1921-22. 1922-23. 1923-24.

The Chief Super- intendent attributes the fall in the number of inoculations mainly to the introduction of fees for the 'serum alone' method of inoculation against rinderpest but it is obviously more closely connected with the smaller prevalence of epidemic disease. It was hoped that the levy of a small fee of As. 8 for inoculation against rinder- pest would result in the realization by the ryots of the value of the operation and that this would prove an incentive to them to produce their animals for the subse- quent inoculations necessary to preserve their immunity. But, as it now appears that the fees have deterred cattle-owners from taking full advantage of the protec- tion against cattle disease afforded by the inoculations, the Government have decided to abolish the fees from April 1925. 8. In reviewing the administration report of the Veterinary Department for 1922-23, the Government expressed the hope that by exempting persons bringing animals for treatment at Veterinary institutions as a class from payment of tolls, district hoards and municipal councils would remove difficulties in the way of such animals being treated at veterinary institutions. The Government are glad to note that this suggestion has been widely adopted and that only a few district boards and municipalities now levy tolls in. such cases. 9. The only important change introduced at the Veterinary College as the result of the recommendations of the Retrenchment Committee was in regard to stipends. The Committee recommended that stipends should be entirely abolished. The Government were unable to accept this recommendation but directed that their number should be reduced to 15 annually. The change has not so far materially affected the strength of the college, the strength of which at the end of the year was 84 against 88 at the end of the previous year. The results of the yearly examina- tions were creditable to the college staff. The Government are glad to note that the refresher course which was held for the second year was considered by the Board of Examiners to have amply justified the institution of this course. 10.

Government of Madras DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT G.O. No. 1449, 6th October 1925 Veterinary2 No. 1449, DEVELOPMENT, 6TH OCTOBER 1925 6. M.R.Ry. R. Narasinga Rao Avargal held charge of the II Circle, Bezwada, throughout the year with the exception of 20 days from 19th June 1924 when he was on leave and during which time Mr. A. J. Wilson was attending to the current duties of the II Circle office in addition to his own as Officer in charge, IV Circle, Madras. Mr. Narasinga Rao was on tour for 183 days and conducted inoculations by the serum simultaneous method on 35 animals at the Chintaldevi Cattle Farm, 7. M.R.Ry. H. C. Sampath Ayyangar Avargal, the permanent Officer in charge of the III Circle, Bellary, was on leave for three months from 26th April 1924, when Mr. W. J. D'Costa was posted to act. Mr. D'Costa was on tour for 50 days and M.R.Ry. Sampath Ayyangar Avargal for 137 days. The latter Officer had to visit the Hagari Farm several times in connexion with an outbreak of Haemonchus contortus among the sheep for the purpose of administering special treatment. 8. Mr. A. J. Wilson was in charge of the IV Circle, Madras, throughout the year and spent 192 days on tour. He attended the Co-operative Society's Conference held at Tinnevelly and delivered a lecture on Rinderpest. The "Madras Veterinary Journal" was, as usual, edited by him. 9. M.R.Ry. K. Kylasam Ayyar Avargal, Officer in charge, V Circle, Coimbatore, was on leave for a short period from the loth to 30th April 1924, and Mr. Wilson was placed in charge of the current duties of the office. Mr. Kylasam Ayyar spent 161 days in camp, attended an outbreak of Piroplasmosis amongst the cross-bred cattle on the Government cattle farm at Hosur and inoculated 123 head of cattle by the serum simultaneous method at Hosur, Vellore and Coimbatore. 10. The Circle Officers' inspections of the work of the staff were all that could be desired and they, in the course of their tours, inspected, as a rule, the Government live-stock wherever they were stationed. II.No. 1449, DEVELOPMENT, 6TH OCTOBER 1925 3 Hospital, Berhampore. There was an increase in the number of cases supplied with medicine but not brought to the institution by over 2,000, and it is attributed to the prevalence of contagious diseases in the vicinity of some institutions. 17. The number of in and out-patients treated at the Veterinary institutions at Berhampore, Cocanada, Nellore, Hindupur, Sivaganga, Devakota, Mangalore, Puttur, Erode and Vellore is less than that of the previous year, but in most of these insti- tutions the decrease could not be attributed to decline in popularity. The fall in the number of patients at the abovementioned institutions is slight except at the Veterinary Hospital, Cocanada, and was mostly due to a fall in the number of smaller animals attended, such as dogs. The Veterinary hospital at Cocanada shows a decrease of 250 cases and this is said to be due to heavy rains and the opening of a dispensary at Draksharam which is only 17 miles from Cocanada. On the other hand, a large majority of the institutions show increase in attendance. 18. The Veterinary dispensary at Manjeri was opened in April 1921; the attendance there had been unsatisfactory from the first, consequently the dispensary was moved to Cannanore and there it is much better appreciated. 19. Government have sanctioned the construction of Veterinary hospital buildings at Adoni and Tiruppur and in-patient wards at the Veterinary dispensary, Coonoor. 20. It is satisfactory to note that all the District Boards except that of Salem, and all Municipalities except those at Anantapur, Tiruvalur and Mangalore have exempted persons bringing animals for treatment at Veterinary institutions from payment of tolls. Correspondence is still going on with those local bodies who have not yet granted the exemption and it is hoped that, ere long, they will fall in line with the majority. 21. The names of 19 Veterinary Assistant Surgeons have been noted for good work done at Veterinary institutions. (b) Itinerating. 22. Five new touring posts were created during the year with headquarters at Palconda, Gudur, Tindiranam, Ambasamudram and Tadpatri. The total number was 78 at the end of the year and this includes a newly made post at Hosur. It was found convenient to move the headquarters of a touring post from Rayadrug to Hospet. 23. A comparative statement of the work done by the touring staff in the last two years is given below:4 No. 1449, DEVELOPMENT, 6TH OCTOBER 1925 The reasons assigned for non-attendance of some of the reports received were either the non-receipt of progress reports or the receipt of intimation that the disease had subsided. 26. Rinderpest.No. 1449, DEVELOPMENT, 6TH OCTOBER 1925 5 37. Kumri.6 No. 1449, DEVELOPMENT, 6TH OCTOBER 1925 of touring billets in this department, but owing to want of provision in the budget to meet the cost involved, the consideration of the scheme has been postponed to next year, Under this scheme the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge of a dispensary will, as a rule, be required to attend outbreaks of contagious diseases occurring in the taluk in which the dispensary is located. 47. The abolition of the Inspectorate has necessitated closer and more frequent inspection of the work of the staff by the Circle officers and as it is found by experience that a Circle officer can control efficiently only 24 subordinates, the formation of a VI Circle in this department has become a matter of urgent necessity, considering the fact that the IV Circle at present consists of 40 subordinates and the V Circle, 35. 48. At the request of the Deputy Inspector of Schools, Nuzvid, the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge of the Veterinary dispensary at Nuzvid has been deliver- ing lectures to the elementary school teachers on the elementary principles of Veterinary Science whenever it is convenient to do so, without extra expense to Government. Generally these teachers are the only literate men in villages and if interest in veterinary matters is aroused in them they should prove to be a useful medium for popularizing the work of the department. 49. The staff found it necessary to complain against village officers on 152 occasions for slackness in reporting outbreaks of contagious diseases. It appears that many of the village officers have yet to realize that if they report promptly, the work of this department would be much facilitated and the mortality among cattle would be less. 50. Civil Veterinary Department leaflet No. VII on Black-quarter was published and distributed during the year. 51. Six men of this department underwent the post graduate course held at the Madras Veterinary College, for six months from 1st July 1924 and at the examination conducted at the end of the course four came out successful. 52. The work of the executive staff ha9 been good on the whole and the Circle officers carried out their duties to the best of their ability. The clerical stuff continued to work satisfactorily.

The itinerating staff was increased by six during the year. The number of non-contagious cases treated rose from 33,705 to 38,206 and of castrations from 6,844 to 8,005. It has been suggested that a more economical disposition of the present limited veterinary staff might be made by abolishing touring posts and posting a veterinary assistant to each taluk who will be responsible far work at his headquarters and in the neighbourhood, including attendance on outbreaks of disease. A trial will, if possible, be given to the experiment next year 5. A regrettable feature of the year was the large increase in cattle mortality consequent on outbreaks of rinderpest in Kurnool, Gaujam. Kistna, Cuddapah and South Kanara. Compulsory inoculation was enforced in parts of Kurnool, Cuddapah and South Kanara and the total number of inoculations performed rose from 13,5 40 to 29,269. The itinerating staff attended to 85 per cent of the outorealcs reported against SO per cent in the previous year and treated 31,616 cases against 6,325. The importance of promptitude in reporting outbreaks of disease cannot be too much emphasized; the Government regret to observe that a number of village officers still fail to realize their responsibilities. The Government observe with satisfaction that 42 municipalities have adopted by-laws for the maintenance of cattle mortality registers which will facilitate the work of the department. 6. The number of convictions under the Act for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was 4,704 against 4,312 in 1924-25. Out of this number, only 930 cases were sent by magistrates for treatment in veterinary infirmaries. Though the pro- portion of cases sent for treatment is higher than in the previous year, the Govern- ment consider that magistrates still do not make sufficient use of their powers in this respect. As in previous years, most of the convictions under the Act come from one district, Trichinopoly. The Government have no reason to suppose that cruelty to animals is specially prevalent in Trichinopoly: they can only conclude that in other districts measures of prevention receive insufficient attention. The Government are glad to observe that all district boards except Salem and all municipalities except Anantapur, Tiruvalur and Mangalore, have exempted persons bringing animals for treatment from the payment of tolls. 7. The working of the Veterinary College and the hospital attached to it was satisfactory. The number of students was smaller than in the previous year; the examination results were creditable. 8.
