FROM T. CHICHELE PLOWDEN, ESQ., C.S., Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts, To THE SECRETARY FOR BERAR TO THE RESIDENT, Hyderabad. Dated Chikalda,1st July 1890. SIR, I have the honor to submit Dr. Little's report on vaccination in the Hyder- abad Assigned Districts during the year 1889-90 prepared in accordance with Home Department Resolution No. 28( 2 ) protected, and not by the total number of operations, for the work of the Hospital Assistant is entirely confined to the town or village in which the dispensary is located. He has not given any figures for selected dispensaries in support of this opinion, but, supposing it to be correct, it shows that a great deal remains to be done to give effect to the Resident's views in paragraph 6 of his review of last year's report. The object to be attained is to make dispensaries popular as centres of vaccination for the surrounding country, and not merely for the particular town or village. Taking all dispensaries together, the percentage of population pro- tected for the year under report is 30.3 compared with a provincial percentage of 34.8. 5. The inspection work by district superintendents is on the whole credit- able to all of them, particularly to Diakar Rao in Buldana and Ajaj Hussain in Ellichpur. In these two districts the percentage of villages visited was 95 and 96 and of work verified 75. The inspections of dispensary work by Civil Surgeons are particularly good in Wun (Apothecary Morrison), and though his percentage of cases is compara- tively low, Dr. Roe (Amraoti) inspected a larger number of cases than any other officer. In Akola (Dr. Reilly) the results show a great advance over those of the preceding year, but there is still ample room for improvement. The difficulty in collecting children so as to verify the 75 per cent. of those vaccinated is a real one, and it can only be overcome by perseverance, by insisting on the patels using their influence, and by gradually accustoming the people to understand what is required. And, bearing in mind the generally friendly attitude of the people in Berar towards vaccination, there is good reason to expect that in this particular matter also they will yield to persuasion. But the Sanitary Commissioner might also ascertain by what methods the difficulty is met in neighbouring provinces. The report does not show the inspection work done by the superintendent himself. 6. The total expenditure of the year was Rs. 16,695-8-9, and the average cost of each successful case Annas 3-1, results which do not differ materially from those of the two preceding years. The orders to extend as far as possible the use of animal lymph were received in December, and it was used in 41 per cent of the total number of vaccinations. But in the districts of Amraoti and Ellich- pur the orders did not receive due attention. 7. In paragraph 23 Dr. Little exhibits figures to show the efficiency of vaccination in diminishing small-pox mortality in Berar. For the first five years ending with 1872-73, during which operations were carried on, the mean ratio of successful cases was 8.92 per 1,000, and the death-rate from small-pox 2.02 per 1,000. In the five years ending with 1887-88 the successful operations stand at 34.68 per 1,000, and the death-rate from small-pox .38 per 1,000. These figures tell their own tale. And it is satisfactory to learn that the people as a whole appreciate the nature and object of the work done by the department, and that, except in the larger towns, serious opposition is not met with. The Amraoti Municipal Committee have recommended the extension of the Vaccination Act to that city, and the question is under consideration whether it should be applied to other towns as well. The correspondence will be submitted in due course for the Resident's orders. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, T. CHICHELE PLOWDEN, Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts.
VACCINATION REPORT OF THE HYDERABAD ASSIGNED DISTRICTS FOR THE YEAR 1889-90. Dated Amraoti Camp, 30th May 1890. Under the orders contained in the Resolution of the Government of India, Home Department, No. 28( 2 ) It will be observed that there were 96,745 primary operations and 6,927 re-vaccinations against 101,225 and 4,377 in 1888-89, and 96,725 and 433 in.1887-88. The cause of the decrease in primary vaccination is attributable to an &quot;un- healthy season, which caused much sickness amongst the vaccinators and a high mortality amongst infants. The number of working days lost to vaccinators on the sick list (and who submitted medical certificates) was 274, as against 127 in 1888-89, and the in- crease in mortality amongst children under one year of age amounted to 5,990 as compared with the previous year. There was an increase in re-vaccination of 2,550 over the figures of the preceding year, and of 6,494 over those of 1887-88. On the whole there has been a decrease of 1,930 in the total out-turn of work by all establishments as compared with 1888-89, but an increase of 6,514 over the work of 1887-88. Result of season's work of several establishments. 5. The results obtained by the several estab- lishments are shown below :( 3 ) Another cause however may have contributed towards this comparatively low susceptibility to re-vaccination in Berar (27.6 per cent.), which is, that most of these operations were performed at ages from 12 to 15, whilst in the Prussian army the majority of those operated upon were between 20 and 30 years of age, so that in their case the protective influence of the primary operation had more time to become weakened. The experience in Berar is that re-vaccination is only successful in those cases where primary vaccination has been imperfectly performed, so that a high percentage of failures in re-vaccination may be taken to indicate the efficiency of the primary vaccination. Statement No. I. Work of special vaccination establishment. 6. Statement No. I gives full particulars of the year's work performedby the special establishment, and the following table shows the progress of the work by districts for the past three years:( 4 ) Under re-vaccination there is a progressive increase noticeable in all districts but Wun, where there was a decrease of 105 operations. Re-vaccination is not popular with the people, who will not see the necessity for repeating the operation. No opportunity is lost of explaining the dangers of imperfect vaccination, and urging the desirability of all persons undergoing re-vaccination about the period of puberty. District results. 7. The following table shows by districts the results obtained in primary vaccination contrast- ed with those for the previous two years :( 5 ) The results of re-vaccination by districts for three years are shown below.( 6 ) TABLE No. 7.( 7 ) TABLE No. 8.( 8 ) It will be observed that there were 75,653 successfully vaccinated children and 78,967 registered births, less the deaths of infants under one year of age, and that infantile protection fell short of the available number by 3,314 or 4.3 per cent. In the Ellichpur, Wun, and Basim districts more children are shown to have been protected than the estimated number available. This may be attributed in part to less accurate registration of births, and in part to the mortality-rate for infants being lower than in the other three dis- tricts of the province. Sex of those vaccinated. 10. Of the sex of those vaccinated by the special establishment, 49,250 were males and 44,601 females, the proportion to total vaccinated being for males 52.4 and for females 47.6, compared with 52.1 and 47.9 in 1888-89 and 51.1 and 48.9 in 1887-88. The census tables of 1881 show the relative proportion of the sexes to be 51.6 for males and 48.4 for females per cent. of total population, so that rela- tively, with reference to the population, more males were vaccinated than females by 1.6 per cent. Proportion of population sucessfully vaccinated. The number of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of the popula- tion is shown in the following table, compared with the preceding two years : ( 9 ) From the 1st of April to the 30th of June 1889 these two vaccinators operated upon 1,475 persons, of which 806 were infants, 575 between one and six years, and 11 children over six and adults. The percentage of success attained was 94.37, and the proportion of the Melghat population protected 32.63 per 1,000. The taluk of Melghat, a section of the Satpura hills, has an area of 1,649 square miles. It is a mountainous and rugged region, extremely unhealthy and feverish, except on the higher ridges, and during the hot season. The population of the taluk, according to last census, is 42,655, and the number of inhabited villages 313. The population is scattered, 25.86 to a square mile, and consists chiefly of aborigines( 10 ) The total number vaccinated by Hospital Assistants during the year was 8,346, as compared with 9,144 in the previous year and 6,847 in 1887-88. In primary vaccination there was a falling-off of 956 operations, but an in- crease under re-vaccination of 158. The falling-off was general in each district, and is chiefly attributable to an unhealthy year, lowering the fecundity of the people and raising the mortality of infants. In estimating dispensary work the proportion of the population or of the births protected should be taken, and not the actual numbers operated on, for dispensary work is entirely confined to the town or village where the dispensary is situated, so that the numbers available annually for vaccination depend on the population of the place. District results. 14. The following table contrasts the district rates per 1,000 of population protected by primary vaccination at dispensary towns for two years:( 11 ) The results in re-vaccination ranged from 51.3 in the Wun district to 31.1 in Amraoti, the average for the provinces being 36.3 as compared with 39.3 and 83.6 respectively in the two previous years. The high percentage shown against Wun is calculated on only 39 cases, too small a number on which to work an average. The rtaios returned for the other districts are more uniform and are appa- rently more reliable than in previous years. Results of works in Berar and other provinces compared. 15. The following table compares some of the results of the work per- formed by the special vaccination and dispensary establishments in Berar with that of other pro- vinces in India. Comparing Berar with the Central Provinces, it will be seen that, though the proportion of population protected is less by 61, yet the mean death-rate of small-pox is also less, the rate for Berar being .28 as gainst .43 in the Central Provinces. TABLE No. 14( 12 ) It will be seen that the proportion of villages visited by Superintendents in which work was performed was 68.6 per cent., and the percentage of cases verified to total operations 70.4, as compared with 59. and 60. respectively in the previous year. The greatest number of children was inspected by the Buldana and Amraoti Superintendents, viz., 11,755 and 10,750 respectively ; the least number inspected was in the Akola District, where the children inspected were only 4,595, owing to the bad health of the Superintendent already referred to. The percentage of work verified was highest in the Ellichpur and Bul- dana Districts, with 75.9-per cent., and these two districts also head the list as regard the percentage of villages visited, in which work was performed, the percentages being respectively 96.1 and 95.6. This record is very creditable to the Buldana Superintendent, Mr. Dinker Rao, whose district is the third largest both as regards area and population. Ellichpur is the smallest district in the province, still Mr. Ajaj Hoossain also deserves credit for the almost complete protection he has given it, which is borne out by the statistics of deaths from small-pox. The average recorded mortality from this disease in the Ellichpur district for the past five years is .02 per thousand, or only 30 deaths in the aggregate for the whole period. There has been marked improvement in the Basim district. Superintend- ent Gangadhar Ramkrishna himself inspected 9,732 cases, as compared with his predecessor, Syed Abdul Kureem, in the previous year. This Superintendent was newly appointed at the beginning of the season, and a still better record may be looked for next year, when he will have become better acquainted with his district. The Buldana Superintendent shows the most travelling and Wun and Ellichpur come next, the number of miles travelled during the season being respectively 2,026, 1,887, and 1,780. On the whole the total number of children inspected is more than last year, and in the discharge of their duties the Superintendents worked zealously and conscientiously. Dispensary vaccination work inspect- ed by Civil Surgeons. 17. The dispensary inspection work done by Civil Surgeons is shown below :( 13 ) Morrison verified 83.3 per cent. of total vaccination, and least in the Ellichpur and Akola Districts, where 34.9 and 35.5 per cent. respectively were inspected. As regard the verification of vaccine operations at dispensaries, Civil Sur- geons are unanimous in representing the great difficulty experienced in having children collected for their inspection, and how it is almost impossible under existing conditions to verify 75 per cent. of the vaccinated children, except at some of the smaller dispensary towns. It was suggested to Civil Surgeons that timely notice should be given to patels, in writing, previous to their visiting a dispensary, requesting that the vaccinated children might be collected for in- spection at any convenient hour and centre, and to report to the Deputy Com- missioner neglect of compliance on the part of the village authorities. Deputy Commissioners were also addressed on the subject and asked to instruct patels to render the required assistance. This procedure has not, however, gained the desired end, and it is reported that though the Deputy Commissioners have issued orders to patels to collect children at some convenient spot, full effect to the orders is not given by these officials. Deputy Commissioners point out that, if the parents refuse to bring their children for inspection, the patels cannot make them do so, and one Deputy Com- missioner writes:( 14 ) As compared with the preceding year, there was a decrease in cost of establishment of Rs. 305-8-3, and an increase under travelling allowance and contingencies of Rs. 45-13-9 and Rs. 143-3-9 respectively. The difference in cost of establishment is due to savings under that head, and the increase in contingencies to the renewal of vaccine appliances. Average cost of each successful case. 20. The average cost of each successful case was annas 3-1, or 2 pies more than in 1888-89 and similar to that for 1887-88. The cost of each successful case was more in all districts, except Basim, than for the previous years. This exception is attributable to a saving under establishment, the permanent vacancy of Superintendent not having been filled up for four months. Lymph. 21. Animal lymph was kept up in each district for the greater portion of the year and renewed by retro-vaccination when required. The subjoined table shows the propor- tion in which the different kinds of lymph was used during 1889-90 :( 15 ) Small-pox. 23. Small-pox was more prevalent throughout the province during 1889 than in either of: the two previous years. Like cholera, it shows a tendency to recur in an epide- mic form during certain years. This epidemic periodicity or fluctuating explosion of disease cannot be explained on any mere biological basis. We know that these epidemic visitations recur in a way which mere contagiousness cannot explain, and we further know that although their advent cannot be controlled, yet timely sanitary measures can mitigate their ravages. The efficacy of vaccination in diminishing small-pox mortality is proved by the statistics of every country in Europe, and the following table will show how small-pox has decreased in this province, as the ratio of successful vaccinations has increased:( 16 ) TABLE No. 20.( 17 ) measure, for the local Administration, as conveyed in Secretary's letter No. 924 of May 1881, &quot; accepted the opinion of the local officers that it would be very inexpedient to introduce the Vaccination Act into Berar at present.&quot; Nearly a decade has passed since the above remarks were expressed, during which the people have become more familiarized with vaccination, which, together with the spread of education and the general growth of knowledge during the past ten years, have greatly weakened, if they have not altogether removed, the popular prejudices and apprehension which led to opposition in the past. The mass of the people are fully alive to the fact that the object of vaccination is to control a deadly and mutilative disease, and there are few who do not admit its efficacy to this end. Vaccination might therefore be made compulsory without much opposition. and in the case of the small minority who would object, it is but right that the law should interefere, as in the case of the man who deliberately acts to the detriment and danger of his neighbour, for, by refusing to accept vaccination, he not only exposes his own unconscious infant to become the prey of a fatal and mutilating disease, but he does so to the detriment of his neighbour's children under three months old, too young to be vaccinated. It is this privilege of unre- stricted small-poxAPPENDICES.

Read( 2 ) a slightly lower percentage of successful primary vaccination, there is a marked diminution in the percentage of successful re-vaccination, a fact which, as far as it goes, does not confirm Dr. Little's theory.&quot; Dr. Little's answer to this criticism would doubtless be that the failure of re-vaccination in the year 1889-90 indicates successful primary vaccination not in the years immediately preceding it, the persons primarily vaccinated in which are not likely to have been re-vaccin- ated in any considerable numbers, but successful vaccination some ten or twelve- years before.

No. 293-G OF 1891. FROM T. CHICHELE PLOWDEN, ESQ., C.S., COMMISSIONER, HYDERABAD ASSIGNED DISTRICTS, To THE SECRETARY FOR BERAR TO THE RESIDENT, Hyderabad. DATED CHIKALDA, the 17 th June 1891. SIR, I have the honour to submit the statistical returns with brief notes compiled by the Superintendent, Dr. Little, showing the work of the Vaccination Depart- ment in the Hyderabad Assigned Districts during the year 1890-91. The return reached my office in print on the 13th June. 2. The total number of persons vaccinated during the year was 103,796 ; the total number of successful operations was 89,351; the percentage of the popula- tion successfully vaccinated was 36.8 per 1,000, and each vaccinator on the average performed 2,171 operations. In all these points the work of the year compares favourably with that of last year. In primary vaccination the per- centage of success is slightly lower than that of last year, 95.1 compared with 95.7. The percentage of the estimated births protected was 75.7. Taking the districts separately, the variations in the ratio of successful re-vaccination are remarkable. The two districts with the largest number of cases are Akola (3,126) and Ellichpur (4,969), but the percentage of successful cases in Akola was only 18.8 against 34.6 in Ellichpur. The high ratio in Buldana has been calculated on a very small number of operations. 2. The low outturn of inspection work by the local superintendents in Akola is explained by the illness of the officers concerned. In other districts, and particularly in Ellichpur and Buldana, the results are satisfactory. The rewards recommended in Dr. Little's paragraph 5 will doubtless be sanctioned; the districts in which the three vaccinators named were employed should have been named. 3 The total number of operations performed at dispensaries was 10,366, an increase of 2,020 compared with 1889-90. In paragraph 18 of the vaccination report for 1889-90 Dr. Little expressed an opinion, for reasons given, in favour of suppressing vaccination at dispensaries and placing the work entirely in the hands of the special establishment. Proposals to this end, which involve no additional expense, were submitted to the Resident shortly after the close of the official year 1890-91 and have been sanctioned. The inspection of vaccination work at dispensaries by the Civil Surgeon of Wun is particularly good( 2 ) animal lymph now in general use in the province. The people are satisfied with the existing system of using animal lymph direct from the calf, and the vaccinators experience no difficulty in obtaining as many calves as are needed. 5. Dr. Little brings to notice the assistance afforded by his Head Clerk,. Mr. George, in carrying out the experiment with lanoline, and I think that he himself merits the commendation of the local administration for the interest he has taken in this important matter, and the success which has attended his- efforts. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, T. CHICHELE PLOWDEN, Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts.
TABLE OF CONTENTS. Para. Brief notes on vaccination statistical returns ... ... ... ... 1 Statement No. I.FROM SURGEON-MAJOR C. LITTLE, M.D., Sanitary Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts, To T. CHICHELE PLOWDEN, ESQ., C.S., Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts. Dated Amraoti, the23rd May 1891. SIR, In accordance with the orders of Government of India, No. 28( 2 ) District work. 3. There has been an increase in each district in the total. outturn of work as compared with the previous year, but the Am- raoti district shows a falling-off in primary vac- cination of 74 cases. This faliing-off is attributed to sickness amongst vaccina- tors and to Head Vaccinator Ismail Khan having been deputed to take charge of the Akola district on the death of Superintendent Trimbak Rao. The ratio of success attained in the several districts in primary vaccination ranged from 97.6 in the Ellichpur district to 91.4 in the Akola district, and in re-vaccination from 55.7 in Buldana to 18.8 in Akola. This discrepancy in the ratio of success in re-vaccination is unsatisfactory. In the Buldana district, not only is the rate too high, but the number of re-vac- cinations is too few, only 474 operations having been performed. The Superin- tendent will be required to give more attention to this duty. Inspection work by District Super- intendents of Vaccination. 4. Of the total 103,796 operations, 56,888 or 54.8 per cent. were verified by Superintendents as shown below:( 3 ) In the Akola district there was an increase of 1,373 cases chiefly in re-vac- cination, in connection with which the Superintendent brings specially to notice the good work of Mr. Surfaraz Alli in medical charge of the Balapur dispen- sary. Of the total number of operations, 8,178 were primary and 2,188 re-vaccina- tions as against 7,771 and 575 respectively in 1889-90. The ratio of success attained was 92.6 and 39 per cent. as compared with 95.7 and 36.3 in the previous year. Dispensary vaccination work in- spected by Civil Surgeons. 7. The percentage of the work in each dis- trict verified by Civil Surgeons is shown below.( 4 ) of Dr. King's discovery. A systematic experiment was accordingly undertaken, the results of which, given in detail in the appendix, conclusively prove the practical value of the lanoline-vaccine paste; and I am of opinion that, given a sufficient supply of calves (cow or buffalo), a depôt for the manufacture of the paste in each province could supply all the lymph required in India. The lymph-paste is obtained by a modification of the German method of lymph collection, which is briefly as follows :APPENDICES.
( 3 ) A.( 4 ) A.( 5 ) B.( 6 ) COMPARATIVE STATEMENT No. IV.7 MEMORANDUM. BY SURGEON-MAJOR C. LITTLE, M.D., SANITARY COMMISSIONER, HYDERABAD ASSIGNED DISTRICTS. In accordance with the instructions conveyed in Government of India Home Depart- ment letter No. 347 of the 6th November 1890, an experiment was undertaken to test the value of lanoline vaccine paste prepared according to the method devised by Surgeon- Major W. G. King, lately officiating as Sanitary Commissioner for Madras. The results of the experiment are set forth in two statements. No. I shows the result of a series of operations on calves for the purpose of obtaining the necessary lymph supply, and No. II the result of the vaccine paste in the hands of several operators. The final result may thus be summed up. From 16 calves operated on, some 1,539 grains of vaccine paste were manufactured. With this virus 2,830 vaccinations were per- formed, the ratio of success obtained being 72.7 per cent. The paste was used with good results up to 44 days, and would probably have retained its vitality for a longer period. The difference in result obtained in the hands of different observers was doubtless due, in a great measure, to want of care and expertness on the part of the operators. In the successful cases, the resulting cicatrices were typical of good vaccination, but the paste appears to produce more inflammation than the pure lymph direct from the calf. The chief difficulty experienced in the preparation of the paste was in regard to the yield of lymph afforded by the calf. In some instances nearly all the inoculations proved successful, but in others only a few succeeded, so that it was impossible to calculate on obtaining a given quantity of lymph from any one animal ; this, however, may have been due to something in the surrounding conditions or circumstances of experiment which greater experience would obviate. The experiment, so far as it went, proves, however, the main point at issue ; i.e., that the vaccine paste thus prepared will bear transport to a distance, and will retain its vitality sufficiently long to render it capable of subserving all the requirements of the department, thus fully confirming the practical value of Dr. King's discovery. This system of paste vaccine is admirably suited for such places where, owing to the prejudices of the people or difficulty in obtaining calves, the use of stored lymph is indis- pensable ; or where large supplies of lymph are required on an emergency to check an out- break of epidemic small-pox. In Berar, where vaccination work is now entirely carried on with pure animal lymph direct from the calf, it would be rather a retrograde step to substitute preserved for fresh lymph, and would besides be much more expensive. For some years to come the present system can be more usefully carried on, approved of and helped by the people, without any extra expenditure to Government and with satis- factory results as to quality and quantity of work. At present, the people are with the department in contributing calves, on loan, for raising the required lymph supply ; but should eventually difficulty arise in connection with this arrangement, we can then fall back on the system of paste manufacture.

Of this number, 8,178 were primary and 2,188 re-vaccinations, against 7,771 and. 575 respectively in 1889-90, and the ratio of success was 92.6 and 39 per cent. compared with 95.7 and 36.3 respectively in the preceding year. As to the falling-off in the Amraoti district, it is ex- plained that the decrease occurred chiefly at the Karinja Dispensary owing to the Medical Officer in charge having obtained leave in the cold weather and to his locum tenens having neglected to push on the work. The Resident hopes that Dr. Little has taken notice of this officer's conduct. As to dispensary vaccination work inspected by Civil Surgeons, the Civil Surgeon, Wun, again heads the list with a percentage of 81.0 of work verified, while the Civil Surgeon, Ellichpur, who verified a lamentably small percentage (22.3) of the work in his district, has, the Resident regrets to notice, again the worst record.

CAMP No. 351-G. OF 1892. FROM COLONEL K. J. L. MACKENZIE, Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts, To THE SECRETARY FOR BERAR TO THE RESIDENT, Hyderabad. Dated Chikalda, 14th June 1892. SIR, I have the honor to submit the Sanitary Commissioner's vaccination notes, which were despatched from his office on the 10th instant and reached me yester- day, the 13th instant. 2. An important and advantageous change was effected during the year in placing towns in charge of the Vaccination Department; formerly the responsi- bility for these rested on Medical Officers who had not the time to attend to the work. First operations have only increased by 752, but re-vaccinations have, nearly doubled, going up from 16,511 to 30,453, which brings the total of provincial operations up to 128,856, being 14,694 in excess of the year previous. 3. The special staff are shown (paragraph 4) to have done well, and as their return of work is subjected by the Superintendent and later by the Sanitary Commissioner to careful check and revision, the result is very satisfactory, especially in connection with the fact that 82.3 per cent. of children under a year old have been got at and protected, and (paragraph 9) it is believed that not many children in the population now remain unvaccinated. 4. Dr. Little has attended to the Resident's wishes in his paragraph 5 in dealing with success in re-vaccination cases. 5. The Resident wished (vide his orders in Secretary's No. 199, dated 18th January 1892, supplementary to Home Secretary's No. 286, dated 8th August 1891, paragraph 4) that the result of operations in the Melghat should be specially noted in this report.

FROM SURGEON LIEUTENANT-COLONEL C. LITTLE, M. D., Sanitary Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts, To COLONEL K. J. L. MACKENZIE, Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts. DATED AMRAOTI, 14th May 1892. SIR, I have the honour to submit the annual vaccination statements for the year 1891-92 with the required explanatory notes thereon. Establishment. 2. The sanctioned establishment of the de- partment remained unchanged throughout the year. Vaccination work in dispensary towns transferred from medical officers to special vaccination estab- lishment. 3. Under the permission of the Resident, as conveyed in Secretary's letter No. 2127,dated 2nd June 1891, the work of vaccin- ation in dispensary towns was transferred from medical officers to the special vaccination estab- lishment. This change was necessitated owing to the introduction of bovine, to the exclusion of humanized lymph, medical officers being practically unable to keep up a supply of animal lymph ; it was also, on other grounds, desirable that the responsibility for the efficient protection of these towns should be centred in the Vaccination Department. Medical officers, however, are not prevented from vaccinating any one who may require the operation at their hands ; and vaccinators have been instructed to comply with all requisitions for lymph from medical officers. Statement No. I( 2 ) The greatest increase in the number of primary operations was recorded in the Amraoti district, viz., 3,204, but, as regards rate of increase to population Ellichpur shows best with an increase of 1,487 operations. There was a very slight falling off in the Wun and Basim districts, but sickness amongst the vaccination staff fully accounts for this, as also for the small increase in the Akola district. The percentage of success in primary vaccination was the same as last year, i.e., 95.1, and ranged from 98.2 in the Amraoti district to 91.3 in Akola. In Berar, the determining the degree of success is not entirely left to the vaccinators themselves. The practice is for the Superintendent to enter in his note-book the results of village inspections, and to correct the vaccinators' re- gisters accordingly before he leaves the circle. Thus, over 50 per cent. of the total primary operations are verified and corrected, and the ratio of success as shown in the annual report is not that originally shown by vaccinators, but as partially verified and corrected by the inspections of District Superintendents. During the year, Superintendents inspected 52.8 per cent, of primary operations, and the proportion per cent. of successful cases observed was 93.3. Of the numbers verified by Sanitary Commissioner, the rate of success was 92.6. Thus the proportion per cent, of success claimed by vaccinators was... 95.1 As verified by Native Superintendents ... ... ... 93.3 By Sanitary Commissioner ... ... ... ... 92.6 The number of successful primary operations amongst infants under one year of age rose from 73,059 in the previous year to 75,949 in the year under review ; and among children over one and under six years of age from 11,028 to 14,752. Thus, out of 100 persons successfully vaccinated, there were 82.7 infants ; 16 children over one and under six ; and 1.3 of other ages. Calculated on the number of infants under one year successfully vaccinated the proportion of the registered births (121,755, or 42 per 1000 of population) protected against small-pox was 63.6 per cent., and ranged from 77.1 in the Ellichpur district to 54.4 in the Akola district. Deducting the deaths of children under one year from the births, the number of infants available for vaccination was 94,147, of whom 82.3 per cent. were protected and 17.7 remained unprotected. Re-vaccination. 5. Considerable attention was given to re-vaccination by the district staff; a total of 29,939 operations was performed as compared with 14,323 in 1890-91. The increase was distributed over the Amraoti, Buldana, Basim and Wun districts. In the districts of Akola and Ellichpur there was a decrease. The percentage of success attained was 29.3, and ranged from 39.5 in the Wun district to 21.6 in the Akola district. The proportion of success returned from Wun is somewhat too high, due to the Superintendent not clearly discriminating between the perfect and modified vesicle, though a circular was issued last year on the subject. A small proportion of the cases in this district, which I inspected in com- pany with the Superintendent, showed that the operation had produced but modi- fied results, the cicatrices being small and poor. The Superintendent assured me he had seen these cases at an early stage when the vesicles appeared regularly developed( 3 ) figures may be accepted as approximately representing the criterion of success- obtainable, having regard to authenticated results elsewhere. In civil practice, there is no statistical record of re-vaccination to serve as a standard of comparison ; but in the British Army, the rate of perfect success attained, when the system of re-vaccination commenced, was 26 per cent. In his review of the last two vaccination reports the Resident remarked on the diminu- tion of the percentage of successful re-vaccinations in Berar, as compared with the record of the Prussian Army, and directed that the matter should be fur- ther referred to in future reports. I have been unable to obtain any recent statistics of the German Army in this connection, nor are similar statistics for the British Army available in my office. I have, however, compiled the following tables from the information within my reach, showing the percentage of success in re-vaccination in 2,973 cases, carefully examined by Native Superintendents for the purpose, compared with the results attained in the Wurtemberg and British Armies :( 4 ) success of 33 per cent, but progressively increased, year by year, till it reached 70 per cent in 1856. As this impermanence in protection had been attributed to degenerated lymph, unrenewed from the cow, I suggested that the low suscep- tibility to re-vaccination in Berar might be due to the employment of lymph of a more protective character. My own experience is that lymph, unrenewed by transmission through the cow, does degenerate by continued transit through successive subjects, and there- fore must lose its prophylactic power ; but whether this deterioration is owing to careless selection of lymph subjects by vaccinators, or to the attenuation of the virus in its successive human transmissions, I would hesitate to assert. Proportion of population protected. 6. The ratio of the population successfully vaccinated was 36.0 per 1,000 as compared with 36.8 in the previous year ; but the rates scarcely admit of comparison being worked on different population figures. Worked on the new census figures, the rate for 1890-91 would be 34.3 per 1,000. According to districts, the proportion ranged from 42.3 in Ellichpur to 31.5 in Akola. The average number of persons successfully vaccinated during the previous 5 years was 33 per 1,000, and the average mortality from small-pox during a similar period was .23 per 1,000. Statement No. II ( 5 ) Vaccination in Berar has come to that point when fluctuations in the num- ber of primary operations will mainly depend upon prosperous seasons or the reverse, as they affect the fecundity of the people. Lymph supply. 10. Animal lymph was used exclusively during the year. During the rains calf vaccination was allowed to die out. In September animal lymph was obtained from Bombay. Lanoline vaccine-paste was manufac- tured at Amraoti head-quarters, and a supply sent out to vaccinators, with which they started work, operating upon a few children with the paste, from them infecting calves, and then keeping up the supply from calf to calf, or by retro-vaccination. There was little difficulty in obtaining calves or young buffaloes, and no opposition in the way of religious prejudice was met with. Compulsory vaccination. 11. The question of compulsory vaccination in municipal towns is still un- der the consideration of municipalities. I believe, however, that the Municipal Committees of Akola, Shegaon, Khamgaon, Akot and Basim have re- solved to apply to the Resident to sanction the introduction of Act XIII of 1890 Names of those -who rendered as- sistance to the Vaccination Depart- ment. 12. The following native gentlemen materially assisted the department in promoting vaccination, and I beg to bring their names to the favourable notice of the Resident:APPENDICES.

In paragraph 10 of the notes the Sanitary Commissioner states that&quot; dur- ing the rains calf vaccination was allowed to die out&quot; without giving a reason for this step. Was it allowed to die out on account of the climatic conditions ? 7. In conclusion the Resident tenders his cordial thanks to Dr. Little for his energetic supervision of the department, and he also desires that his recogni- tion of their services may be conveyed to the gentlemen named in the twelfth paragraph of the notes. A separate application should be submitted for sanction to the payment of the usual rewards to the three vaccinators who have done the best work during the year. (By order,) G. R.

REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE HYDERABAD ASSIGNED DISTRICTS FOR THE OFFICIAL YEAR 1892-93. BY SURGEON-MAJOR CHARLES LETHBRIDGE SWAINE, M.D., M.C. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Hyderabad : PRINTED AT THE RESIDENCY GOVERNMENT PRESS. 1893. Price one rupee per copy.
CAMP No. 210 OF 1893-94. FROM COLONEL K. J. L. MACKENZIE, Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts, To THE SECRETARY FOR BERAR TO THE RESIDENT, Hyderabad. Dated Camp Chikalda, the 22nd June 1893. SIR, I have the honor to submit Sanitary Commissioner's Vaccination Report for 1892-93. It reached me late yesterday only, due, the Sanitary Commissioner reports, to a miscarriage of his post, which was not recovered for eight days. II. Work during the year reported on, vide paragraphs 3 and 4, shows a satisfactory increase, the increase of establishment being only two vaccinators. Under primary vaccination there was an increase of 3,371 cases, and under re- vaccinations 13,655 cases. There was a very slight fall, paragraph 5, in the percentage of successes in primary vaccination, 94.7 against 95.1 in the year previous, and a somewhat larger fall in the percentages of re-vaccinations, 24.8 against 29.3 ; but as the percentage in &quot; unsuccessfuls&quot; was better, 44 against 46 per cent., this fall is due really to a rise in &quot;unknowns&quot;. Re-vaccinations increased in all districts, and the results under &quot; Primary&quot; would have been better but for failure in Amraoti and Buldana, explained in paragraph 6. III. The practical result of work in this department is well shown in para- graph 13. Berar compared with the other nine Governments and Provinces of India, Burmah being counted as Upper and Lower, it seems that 1stly, each Berar vaccinator on the average vaccinated 3,316. In the Punjab, the next highest, but 2,718 cases per man is done, and results tail down to Bengal with its 625 cases per vaccinator. 2ndly, in the ratio of successes Berar stands fourth with 94.5. Bengal and the Central Provinces, who head the list, followed by Bombay and the Punjab, being credited with 99.43 and 96.40 per cent. respectively; Lower Burmah is the lowest with 85.21. 3rdly, in proportion of population protected Berar comes second with its 37.0 per cent., the Central Provinces showing 38.25. In Upper Burmah the percentage is 14.37. And 4thly, in the percentage of births to every 1,000 of population protected, Berar heads the list with 66.4, in Assam the percentage goes as low as 9.9. IV. It is unnecessary for me to follow the details of working given by the Sanitary Commissioner, paragraphs 7 to 12 of his report inclusive. It is satisfactory, however, that such a good beginning has been made in the Melghat (paragraph 12), and if hill men inured to the climate can be trained as vaccinators, regular results will be obtainable. At first start our hill people through fear begotten of ignorance were obstructive, but having seen the immunity those vaccinated have when small-pox is about, they are now anxious and ready to bring their children forward. At Gossur close B-870
( 2 ) to Akola (the Sanitary Commissioner has told me) there was an outbreak of small-pox and 25 persons were attacked. None of these had been vaccinated, and none who had been vaccinated contracted the disease. Facts like these tend to overcome obstruction and convert people more readily than any preach- ings of officers. Mahomedans and Marwarees, residents chiefly in our municipal towns, who ought to be enlightened, areTABLE OF CONTENTS. Para.

No. 47 OF 1893. FROM SURGEON-MAJOR C. L. SWAINE, M.D., M.C., Offg. Sanitary Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts, To COLONEL K. J. L. MACKENZIE, C.I.E., Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts. DATED AMRAOTI, 13th May 1893. SIR, Full report. Under the orders contained in the Resolution of the Government of India, Home Department, No. 28-1579-95 of July 1887, I have the honor to forward a full report on the working of the Vaccination Department in the Hyderabad Assigned Districts for the year 1892-93. Season's work started with lanoline vaccine paste. 2. I assumed charge of the office on the 18th of August 1892, when the season's work was closed owing to rains. In Sep- tember, lanoline paste was manufactured at Amraoti, and supplied to all the vaccinators in the province to start the work, and since nothing but calf lymph has been used. Two extra vaccinators for Melghat. 3. The vaccination establishment was in- creased by two vaccinators, both for the Melghat. Work of all establishments for three years compared. 4. The following table shows the total num- ber of vaccine operations performed in the pro- vince for three years :( 2 ) TABLE No. 2.( 3 ) TABLE No. 4.( 4 ) The percentage of success obtained varied from 26.9 in Basim district to 23.8 in Wun and 22 in Buldana; as compared with the record of the previous years, there has been an improvement in recording these results in all the districts. The percentage of unknown cases varied from 12.6 in Wun to 45.3 in Amraoti district. This large number of unverified cases in Amraoti district was due to lack of supervision as already explained. Class of those vaccinated. 8. The following statement shows the num- ber of primary operations according to class :( 5 ) TABLE No. 7.( 6 ) The available number of infants is calculated by deducting the registered deaths of children under one year from registered births, and though not abso- lutely correct, yet it affords approximate data for gauging the protection afford- ed. It will be observed that there were 76,986 successfully vaccinated children and 91,529 registered births, less the deaths of infants under one year, and that infantle protection fell short of the available number by 14,543 or 15 per cent. Sex of those vaccinated. 10. Of the sexes vaccinated, 89,713 were males and 56,169 females, the proportion to total vaccinated being for males 61.5 and females 38.51. Result by class of those vaccinated. 11. The proportion of persons vaccinated ac- cording to class is shown in the following table:( 7 ) The following table shows separately the vaccination work done in Melghat during the year under report:( 8 ) Inspection work of Superintendents of Vaccination. 14.

The strength of the establishment was increased by two vaccinators for the Melghat. Two vaccinators were declared unfit for further service by a Medical Board and pensioned, and two Superintendents were on three months' sick leave each.

SIR, I have the honor to forward the Sanitary Commissioner's explanatory notes on the vaccination returns for the year 1893-94. The proof copy was received in my office on the 30th May. 2. There is really little left for me usefully to say. There has been a slight fall in the outturn of work, due to a very sickly season, which affected both the vaccinatory staff and those they have to operate on. Nevertheless Berar vaccination work is very satisfactory, and, as pointed out in paragraph 5 of the notes, it has reached that point that fluctuations in the number of primary operations depend on the character of the season, as affect- ing the public health and the birth-rate. 3. The diagram in paragraph 7, as to the proportion of the population pro- tected, and the death-rate from small-pox per 1,000 of the population, is in- structive and satisfactory. 4. The cost of operations rose from Rs. 17,234-7-10 to Rs. 17,495-7-6, owing to the increase in establishment for the Melghat. 5. Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel Little has brought the department to the condition it is in, and during his absence for the greater part of 1893, Surgeon- Major Swaine very efficiently and zealously filled his place. 6. The rewards recommended in paragraph 8 should be sanctioned to the three vaccinators named. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, K. J. L. MACKENZIE, COLONEL, Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts. B-31
TABLE OF CONTENTS. Para. Submission of annual vaccination statements ... ... ... ... 1 Statement No. INo. 67 OF 1894. FROM SURGEON-LIEUT.-COLONEL C. LITTLE, M.D., Sanitary Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts, To COLONEL K. J. L. MACKENZIE, C.I.E., Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts. Dated Amraoti, the 12th May 1894. SIR, I have the honor to submit the annual vaccination statements for the year 1893-94, together with the required explanatory notes thereon. Statement No I. 2. The establishment worked up to its full strength, the number of vacci- nators employed throughout the year on executive work being 44. The total number of operations amounted to 137,152, as compared with 145,882 in the previous year. Each vaccinator performed on an average 3,117 operations. In 1892-93 the average number of operations per man was 3,316. The number of primary operations was 97,786 and re-vaccination 39,366, as against 101,774 and 44,108 respectively in 1892-93. Re-vaccination is not popular in Berar, and though considerable pressure has been brought to bear on the vaccination staff in this direction, the result, in many ways, has not been altogether satisfactory. This subject has been noticed in previous reports, vide the following extract from the report for 1887-88 :( 2 ) In all 101,298 successful vaccinations were performed against 107,251 in the previous year, or a decrease of 5,953 operations. This decrease is attributed to disability, through sickness, of the vaccination staff, during the period under report. It may be seen from the subjoined comparative statement, that 25 vaccina- tors were ill for 407 days in the aggregate ; whereas in the previous year only 12 men were on the sick list for 115 days. TABLE No 1.( 3 ) A reference to table No. 1 will show that the staff of these two districts suffered most from the universal sickness of the year. Statement No. II. 3. The total cost of the establishment, which is entirely met from Provincial Funds, was Rs. 17,495-7-6, as compared with Rs. 17,234-7-10 in the previous year. The increase of Rs. 261 is due to the increase in the establishment for the Melghat entertained in August 1892. The pay of the sanctioned establishment amounts to Rs. 17,484 per annum. The average cost of each successful case was 2 annas 9 pies against 2 annas 7 pies last year. Statement No. III. 4. Statement No. III is blank, dispensary vaccination having been trans- ferred to the special establishment since July 1892. Statement No. IV. 5. This statement shows the number of persons primarily vaccinated and the number successfully operated upon during a series of years and calls for no comment beyond the fact that the numbers operated upon remain very much the same in recent years. This may be accounted for by the fact that some 33.7 per 1,000 of the population have been protected annually by primary vaccination for the last ten years. The birth-rate for a similar period has been in the annual proportion of 40.74 for 1,000, so that allowing for deaths, there would not be many children in the population unvaccinated. Therefore, as pointed out in a previous report, vaccination in Berar has come to that point, when fluctuations in the number of primary operations will mainly depend upon healthy and prosperous seasons or the reverse, as affecting the fecundity and well-being of the people. Statement No. V. 6. Statement No. V shows particulars of the inspection work done by the Superintendents of the department. Owing to breaks in my tour in connection with sanitary duties, and to an attack of influenza with heavy complications, I was unable to inspect as much of the vaccination work as I could have wished, but that seen, in each district, was on the whole well done and honestly recorded. In the Basim district the lymph in use was found to be weak and had to be renewed. This would account for the low rate of success in this district in primary vaccination. Of the native Superintendents, the lowest outturn of work was done by the Akola Superintendent, and the highest by the Superintendent of Ellichpur as shown below:( 4 ) Small-pox. 7.

CAMP No. 88 OF 1896. FROM F. S. BULLOCK, ESQ., I.C.S., COMMISSIONER, Hyderabad Assigned Districts, To THE SECRETARY FOR BERAR TO THE RESIDENT, Hyderabad. Dated Chikalda, the 12th June 1896. SIR, I have the honor to submit for the Resident's information the Annual Re- port on Vaccination for the year 1895-96 in the Hyderabad Assigned Districts by Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel C. Little, Sanitary Commissioner, with the fol- lowing remarks. 2 The report was received in print in my office on June 10th, 1896. 3. The vaccination staff was the same as shown last year. 4. The system in force in Berar is vaccination with animal lymph taken direct from the calf, and is said to be preferred to arm-to-arm vaccination. 5. There was a decrease of vaccination in the past year of 602 primary and 7,432 re-vaccinations, which is said to be due to unhealthiness of the past two seasons, causing increased mortality among children. 6. The protection afforded amounted to 82.1 per cent. of registered births; and the falling off in re-vaccination is attributed to the unpopularity of the second operation. Two districts show an increase, while the remaining four show a falling off. The decrease in Akola is considerable, and is accounted for by delay in the receipt of lymph and mortality and sickness among the children ; but apparently the Superintendent in charge of the Akola district showed a want of activity and energy which has called down censure upon him. The results of vaccination, both primary and secondary, have been better, and 95.9 per cent. for the former is quite satisfactory. 7. In Tables VII and VIII the proportionate protection of the population is compared and the efficacy in diminishing mortality from small-pox. In Ellichpur the proportion is highest, viz., 43.1, but the mean rate of the year is below the average. The results of vaccination in diminishing mortality are de- cidedly satisfactory, but the comparison between protection and mortality shown in the diagram is scarcely conclusive. 8. As regards supervision, there is a slight improvement shown this year, but it cannot be said that it is altogether satisfactory. In Amraoti there is a distinct falling off attributed to the Superintendent's ill-health. In Wun the inspections were more than double those of last year, and there was an improve- ment in Akola and Buldana. The percentage has risen from 45.4 to 52.0 in primary vaccination, but the two most important districts( 2 ) Akola district evidently needs a great deal more personal attention from the Sanitary Commissioner than it has received. 9. The cost of the department appears to increase slowly, and the average cost of each successful vaccination has risen by one pie this year and by four pie in the last two years. This is a tendency which should be avoided. 10. The Vaccination Act has been extended to every municipal town except Karinja, and the results appear to be successful. There have been no prosecutions found necessary, and the ratio of primary vaccination per mille is higher than the birth-rate. More attention is required in Ellichpur and Akola and Khamgaon to this work, and I intend to address Municipal Committees with a view to interesting them in the subject. A return of children vaccinated should be sent weekly to the Municipal Secretary for check, and this would necessitate greater interest being taken. 11. Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel Little has mentioned three vaccinators as entitled to rewards and commended others, officials, &c., for their good work to the Resident's notice. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, F. S. BULLOCK, Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts.

No. 26 of 1896. FROM SURGEON-LIEUTENANT-COLONEL C. C. LITTLE, M.D., Sanitary Commissioner, &c., Hyderabad Assigned Districts, To F. S. BULLOCK, ESQ., I.C.S., Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts. Dated Amraoti, the 18th May 1896. SIR, I have the honor to forward, for the information of the Resident, the Report on Vaccination for the year 1895-96. Full report. 1. In accordance with Government of India, Home Department, Resolu- tion No. 28/1579-95 of July 1887, a full report on the working of the department is submitted. Establishment. 2. The establishment worked up to its sanc- tioned strength as shown below :( 2 ) Season's work. 4. The following table shows the season's work contrasted with that of the previous two years :( 3 ) Districts. 5. There was an increase in primary operations in the districts of Amraoti and Ellichpur of 263 and 1,956 respectively. The increase in the Ellichpur returns is due chiefly to the inclusion of the figures for Melghat, which are no longer shown separately, but included in the return for Ellichpur, in which district the Melghat is situated. In the following districts there was a falling off:( 4 ) The percentage of success obtained varied from 33.3 in the Basim district to 19.2 in Amraoti. For the sake of comparison the results of vaccination in the Army Medi- cal Department and in the Hyderabad Contingent are shown below:( 5 ) TABLE No. VII.( 6 ) Diagram showing the proportion of population protected during seven years ending 1895-96 and the death-rate from small-pox per 10,000 of population during 1895. Table No. 8 demonstrates very clearly the protection afforded by vaccin- ation, and bears evidence to the efficiency of the work performed. The success secured in the reduction of the death-rate from small-pox is one of the most gratifying results obtained by the Sanitary Department. With regard to the diagram, as remarked by the Resident on last year's report, &quot; immunity from deaths from small-pox is not in all cases in inverse ratio to assumed protection,&quot; but it must be remembered that the mortality figures are those for one year only, and in view of the fact that small-pox, like other epidemics, is erratic in its visitations and seldom equally distributed, it would be unsafe to compare any one district with another on the statistics of one year. Sex. 9. Of the sexes of those vaccinated, 59,341 were males and 47,264 females; the proportion to total vaccinated being for males 55.6 and for females 44.4 as compared with 58.0 and 42.0 in 1894-95 and 60.9 and 39.1 in 1893-94. The census tables of 1891 show the relative proportion of the sexes to be 51.5 for males and 48.5 for females per cent. of total population, so that rela- tively with reference to the population more males were vaccinated than females. Age. 10. Of the ages of those successfully vaccinated, 67,439 were infants under 1 year of age; 19,200 children between 1 and 6 ; and 2,278 individuals over 6 years of age and adults.
( 7 ) Thus out of 100 persons successfully vaccinated, 75.9 were infants, 21.6 children between 1 and 6, and 2.5 of other ages. The following table contrasts the ages of the successfully vaccinated for the past three years:( 8 ) There is no reason why the Akola Superintendent should not have inspect- ed a larger proportion of the work of his vaccinators. He has been censured, and will be transferred to a smaller district if he cannot do better in Akola. Cost of the department. 12. The table given below shows the cost of the Vaccination Department in 1895-96 com- pared with the two previous years : ( 9 ) Allowing for mortality amongst infants, the rates per 1000 of population vaccinated should be only a little lower than the birth-rate. The above table shows that the ratio of population protected in the towns of Ellichpur, Basim, Khamgaon, and Akola was too low, and that more attention is required by these municipalities to the carrying out of the provision of the Act. Vaccination work in several pro- vinces compared. 14. The following table has been compiled for the purpose of comparing the vaccination results obtained in Berar with those of the other pro- vinces in India:( 10 ) List of gentlemen who assisted the department in promoting vaccination during 1895-96.

Had the vaccinators turned out on an average 3,117 cases as they did in 1893-94 the cost would have been reduced by about one-fourth. 5. Inspection, the Resident is glad to learn, has been more diligently carried out this year than it was last, but the circumstances of the Amraoti and Akola districts deserve the Sanitary Commissioner's consideration. The Com- missioner's remark that in municipalities the ratio of primary vaccination per mille was higher than the birth-rate was probably due to an error since dis- covered in table No. 12. The registered birth-rate is 38.3 ; the ratio of primary vaccination only 35.8. The primary vaccination of municipal children under 1 year old is still far from exhaustive, and the Resident hopes that now that vaccination has been made compulsory the results will be greater. He thinks too that in these areas revaccination might be considerably developed without prejudice to primary work. The question of extending the Vaccination Act, XIII of 1889, to the last-formed municipality of Karanja should be brought before the Municipal Committee. 6. The Resident is pleased to sanction the rewards recommended by Dr. Little in paragraph 15 of his report, and he notes with satisfaction that so many native gentlemen have assisted the department in promoting vaccination. At present vaccination is best in the small municipalities of Yeotmal and Akot, with Amraoti Town third, and Basim fourth ; but it is to be hoped that the large municipal towns of Ellichpur City, Akola, and Khamgaon will soon assert their position. The two civil station municipalities might be expected to give better results. 7. In conclusion, the Resident thanks Dr. Little for his interesting report, and has much pleasure in recording his appreciation of the manner in which the duties of the department under his control have been performed. The smoothness with which the work is accomplished and the fair measure of popularity which vaccination has attained are due in great part to the strong personal interest Dr. Little takes in it and to the supervision he has exercised.

CAMP No. 430 OF 1897. FROM F. S. BULLOCK, ESQ., I.C.S., Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts, To THE SECRETARY FOR BERAR TO THE RESIDENT, Hyderabad. Dated Camp Chikalda, the 31st May 1897. SIR, I have the honor to submit the Notes on Vaccination in the Hyderabad Assigned Districts for the year 1896-97, together with the annual statements forwarded by Brigade-Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel C. C. Little, Sanitary Com- misioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts. 2. The department has lost an old and experienced officer by the death of Mr. Ajaj Hussain during the year. The strength of the vaccination staff is unaltered. 3. The work done in the year shows an increase of 12.6 per cent. over that of the previous year, and has only been exceeded twice in the last twelve years. There was an increase of 5,900 primary operations with a percentage of success of 96.8, and of 7,806 secondary vaccination with a percentage of 20.5 of success. 4. The proportion of population protected was 34.5 as against 31.8, the Ellichpur district having the highest protected rate of 42.9. In the Amraoti district the average number of vaccinations per operator was 3,120, which is very good. 5. The percentage of available infant births protected was 90.2 of total registered. The table given in paragraph 10 illustrates the efficacy of vaccination in diminishing mortality from small-pox and is satisfactory, and the diagrams which compare the degree of protection with the average death-rate show that Ellichpur with the greatest amount of protection has the lowest death- rate. It is remarkable, however, that Wun with its small amount of protec- tion has so low a death-rate. 6. Compulsory vaccination under the Act is now in force in all the muni- cipalities, and is reported to be working satisfactorily. 7. The cost of the department has slightly decreased, and the average cost of successful cases has fallen from 3 annas 1 pie to 2 annas 9 pies. 8. Inspections by the District Superintendents are reported to be satisfac- tory, and amount to 55.8 of all operations, and the result of 97 per cent. of success is creditable. 9. Animal lymph is most largely used, and no opposition or caste pre- judice has been met with. Calves are liberally supplied by patels of villages at a minimum of cost. Arm to arm vaccination was unpopular, and Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel Little seems to be quite satisfied with the present system. The use of Lano- line paste lymph would require a costly establishment for general use, and is only used for monsoon operations to start work with. 10. The Sanitary Commissioner gives the names of the vaccinators who have done well and other officials who have given special assistance to his de- partment, whose services in promoting vaccination deserve notice. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, F. S. BULLOCK, Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts. B-69TABLE OF CONTENTS. Para.

C LITTLE, M.D., Sanitary Commissioner, &c., Hyderabad Assigned Districts, To F. S. BULLOCK, ESQ., I.C.S., Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts. Dated Amraoti, the 1st May 1897. SIR, I have the honor to forward, for the information of the Resident, the Report on Vaccination for the year 1896-97. Submission of annual vaccination statements. In accordance with the Government of India, Home Department, Resolu- tion No. 28/1579-95 of July 1887, the report this year consists of brief commentary explanatory of the statistics set forth in the prescribed annual state- ments. Changes in supervision. 2. First Class Superintendent of Vaccination Ajaj Husain, in charge of the Ellichpur district, died during the year, and Mr. Gopal Balaji was appointed in his stead. Mr. Ajaj Husain entered the department in 1869, and for 21 years performed the duties of a District Superintendent. He was connected with the department from its infancy, and did much good work in extending vaccination at a time when the attitude of the people was not over friendly to those employed on the work. He was a trustworthy, reliable man, and in him the department loses an experienced and efficient officer. Statement No. I( 2 ) The percentage of unsuccessful operations to total vaccinated was 1.7 and of unknown cases 1.3 as compared with 2.1 and 2.0 respectively in the pre- vious year. Re-vaccination. 6. The number of re-vaccination was 21,717, being an increase of 7,806, or 56.1 per cent., over last year's figures. The increase was general in each district, Akola, Amraoti, and Wun head- ing the list. The percentage of success in re-vaccination was 20.5 as against 23.4 in 1895-96. The rate ranged from 29.4 in the Ellichpur district to 15.5 in Wun. The percentage of unknown cases returned is 41.6, the cause of which is attri- buted to the fact that the bigger children labour in the fields, and are generally absent from the village at time of inspection. Though there may be some truth in this explanation, yet it is not entirely satisfactory, and Superintendents and their vaccinators will be required to give more attention to the verification of these cases in future. Proportion of the population protected. 7. The proportion of the population protected was 34.5 as against 31.8 in the previous year. Protection ranged from 42.9 in the Ellichpur district to 27.5 in Wun. In the Akola and Buldana districts the rate was the same, 35.7, and in Amraoti 34.1. The following table summarises the work in each district as compared with the previous year:( 3 ) The following table shows the protection afforded to infants under one year of age as compared with the previous year :( 4 ) Diagram showing the proportion of population protected during seven years ending 1896-97 and the death-rate from small-pox per 10,000 of population during 1896. Small-pox prevailed in every district of the province during the year. Its distribution as compared with last year is shown below :( 5 ) Diagram showing the average proportion of population protected and the average death-rate from small-pox per 10,000 of population during the ten years from 1887-88 to 1896-97. This diagram shows that small-pox mortality is lowest in the best vacci- nated district (Ellichpur), though the district with next lowest death-rate from small-pox (Wun) shows lowest protection, whilst the other districts with very similar protection show variable death-rates ranging from 3.1 per 10,000 in the Buldana district to 2.0 in Amraoti. Municipalities. 11. During the year under report, the provisions of the Vaccination Act were extended to the municipality of Karinja, so the Act is now in force in all municipalities in the province. B-69( 6 ) The following statement shows the progress of vaccination in each munici- pality compared with the previous year :( 7 ) TABLE No. 5.( 8 ) The following statement compares the inspection work done by each Superintendent:( 9 ) old arm to arm system as practised by uneducated and unprofessional men at a distance from immediate supervision. Another point in favor of animal lymph in public estimation was that calf vaccination did away with the necessity for a child being taken from one village to another for the purpose of affording a lymp supply, or for the child of a high caste man being vaccinated from one of low caste, both procedures being unpopular and often strongly objected to. In regard to religious prejudice, none was met with, though it is more than probable that had the villagers not been gradually accustomed to see calves and buffaloes vaccinated until it had become quite a commonplace procedure, and had they not had time to realize the advantages to themselves accruing from the use of animal lymph, I have no doubt objection would have been raised on one ground or another. When the system of vaccination direct from the calf to the exclusion of the arm to arm method was introduced, it was anticipated there would be some trouble in the procuring and feeding of the calves ; but this has not proved to be the case, save in municipalities, where, owing to the difficulty of procur- ing animals, the use of lanoline lymph has been recommended. Berar being entirely an agricultured province with large herds of cattle in most villages, there is no difficulty, as a rule, in obtaining calves for vaccination purposes. The village patel supplies the vaccinator on loan with the animals required, receiving a receipt for the same, he, in his turn, passing a receipt to the vaccinator when the calf is returned to him. Each vaccinator has a circle assigned to him averaging some 60,000 inhabitants, and is required to reside permanently in his circle. This circle is sub-divided for vaccination purposes into smaller circles, each of which has to be taken up systematically in rotation and protected as far as possible at the rate of 40 per 1,000 of the population. Before leaving one sub-division and going on to another, the vaccinator has to report to his Superintendent and obtain his permission, which is not granted if the Superintendent considers the rate of protection afforded insufficient. Under this arrangement District Superintendents have systematic control over their men, and the vaccinator, or &quot; Devi Doctor&quot; as he is called, comes to be well known to the people amongst whom he resides, and, if he is a good man, soon gains their confidence and respect. At the close of the monsoon, generally about the end of September, each vaccinator is furnished with a small quantity of lanoline paste lymph to start. his supply, which is allowed to die out during the rains. With the paste a few children are vaccinated, and when a successful result has been obtained, a calf is inoculated from a child's arm, and vaccination then kept up from calf to calf or renewed from a healthy child should it show signs of degenerating. The method of itineration is as follows On the result day, in a certain village, the vaccinator protects as far as possible all the available children, and operates upon one or more calves; these he distributes to the village or villages he may have arranged to work in next, usually situated not more than three or four miles distant, leaving the animal in charge of the patel, who tells off a watan- dar dher to look after it, and to supply it with grass and water. Only weaned animals are used for vaccination purposes. The vaccinator having affixed a bamboo collar to its neck to prevent it licking itself, goes off to another village, where he may have a result to record, or another calf ready to yield lymph for vaccination. On the fifth day, or 96 hours as near as possible from date of operation, he returns to inspect the calf, and if the result is successful, which is usually the case, he has the children collected and proceeds to vaccinate them, first cleansing the shaven part of the calf with warm water as well as the children's arms( 10 ) Lanoline lymph. 17. When in 1889 a brochure by the late Surgeon-Major Barclay giving a description of the methods employed in Germany to produce and preserve animal lymph was cir- culated by the Government of India, experiments were made in Berar on the German lines, but without any great degree of success. Both glycerine and vaseline were tried, but failed to preserve the vitality of animal lymph beyond two or three days probably owing to the dry heat of Berar. Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel King, who was also experimenting in a similar direction in Madras, at this time hit upon lanoline as a preservative, and following his procedure, I was successful in producing a lanoline paste lymph which gave good results, and was capable of retaining its vitality for a month. Lanoline paste since then has been used for starting the season's operations. In 1890 Deputy Surgeon-General J. G. Pilcher, when Sanitary Commis- sioner for Central Provinces, sent a Head Vaccinator and Assistant Surgeon Surrendranath Barat to Berar to learn the method of paste manufacture, and afterwards established a depôt at Jubbulpore for its production. It was also contemplated to introduce the use of lanoline lymph through- out this province as likely to facilitate vaccination in the districts and to reduce expenditure by enabling the work to be carried on by fewer vaccinators, but after working out details in regard to professional superintendence, as from the nature of my duties I could not personally supervise the work, and calculating the cost of the purchase and feed of calves at the depôt, I came to the conclu- sion that it would be more costly than the present system, and more troublesome. My own experience, moreover, is in favor of vaccination direct from the calf, and so long as we, have not to pay for the hire and feeding of calves, I would not recommend any change, though the time may come when it will be necessary to carry on vaccination entirely with lanoline paste lymph, as is so successfully done in Mysore. In such case it would be desirable to start the depôt for the production of the lymph under professional supervision at one of our coolest stationsAPPENDICES.

READ( 2 ) further consideration before a final decision is arrived at. In the Bombay Presi- dency it is precisely in the larger towns that calf-to-arm vaccination seems to work best. Dr. Little's plan of dividing every vaccination circle into a number of sub-divisions, each of which is thoroughly vaccinated successively until the whole circle is protected, is a most admirable one. 5. The efficiency of vaccination in preventing small-pox mortality is demon- strated in table III, the mean death-rate from small-pox being .2 per mille. The cost of every successful case fell from 3 annas and 1 pie in 1895-96 to 2 annas and 9 pie in 1896-97. The percentage of inspections has risen from 53.8 to 57.4, which is consi- dered satisfactory. The high percentage of successful cases seen by the Sanitary Commissioner is explained by him in paragraph 15 of his Notes. 6. In conclusion, the Resident's thanks are due not only to Brigade- Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel Little and his staff for their sustained interest in the work of vaccination, but to the officers and gentlemen named in paragraph 18 of the Notes. The report, though brief, is instructive, and the results reported will, it is hoped, compare favourably with those of British India. (By order.) ARTHUR F. PINHEY, Secretary for Berar.

CAMP No. 112. FROM J. A. CRAWFORD, ESQ., OFFICIATING COMMISSIONER, Hyderabad Assigned Districts, To THE SECRETARY FOR BERAR TO THE RESIDENT, Hyderabad. Dated Chikalda, the 14th June 1898. SIR, I have the honour to submit the Sanitary Commissioner's Notes on Vac- cination in Berar during the year 1897-98, which reached me in print on the 11th instant. 2. The copy before me shows two mistakes in table 1 of paragraph 4. The total for Wun in 1896-97 should be 15,484 (13,112+2,372) instead of 15,284, and the total for the province in that year should be 120,311 (98,594+21,717) instead of 120,111. Thus last year's number of operations exceeded the total of the year before by 4,978. In primary vaccination there was a decrease of 3,546. This is attributed to the very high mortality amongst children in a year of scarcity and distress. The distribution of the decrease over districts is shown below:( 2 ) Buldana has a large increase to contrast with its large decrease in primary vaccinations, and the same may be said of Ellichpur. Wun has under both heads an aggregate increase of 4,973, not 5,173 as stated in paragraph 4 of the Notes. This is certainly very creditable to the district staff if it at all represents genuine work. It is probably easier with children at any rate to show a large outturn in re-vaccination than in primary operations. I believe that in some provinces there are orders against re-vaccinating children within a certain period. During the last three years re-vaccinations have risen from 13,911 to 30,241. The total used to be higher, but in 1894 the Government of India apparently issued orders restricting re-vaccination. 3. On the average there were 44 vaccinators employed during the year, and each did 2,847 operations, 2,160 being primary and 687 re-vaccinations. The outturn was over 2,900 in Buldana, Amraoti, and Wun, and the percent- age of successful primary cases was best in those districts. Amraoti comes first with 98.3, and the provincial percentage was 96.4. The Sanitary Com- missioner is doubtless right in suspecting the high percentages of re-vaccina- tions reported as &quot;successful&quot; in Ellichpur and Buldana. The percentage of inspections by Superintendents fell from 55.8 to 53.1. This is attributed to a year of distress; and, as the Sanitary Commissioner observes, even the lower figure is in advance of several other provinces. 4. The work done in Municipalities, all of which are under the compul- sory Act, may conveniently receive separate notice from the Sanitary Com- missioner as in paragraph 11 of the Notes for 1896-97. 5. There is a long list of those who gave valuable assistance to the Vacci- nation Department and a short list of three obstructive patels, who have no doubt been reported to the Deputy Commissioner of Akola. Three vaccina- tors are recommended for the usual reward. 6. Brigade-Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel Little can look back upon re- markable progress in vaccination during his long tenure of office in Berar. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, J. A. CRAWFORD, Officiating Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts.

FROM BRIGADE-SURGEON-LIEUT.-COL. CHARLES COLHOUN LITTLE, M.D., Sanitary Commissioner, &c., Hyderabad Assigned Districts, To J. A. CRAWFORD, ESQ. I.C.S., Officiating Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts, Dated Amraoti, the 12th May 1898. SIR, I have the honour to submit the annual vaccination statements for the year 1897-98 with the following explanatory notes thereon. Strength of department. 2. The strength of the department remained the same as in previous years, and worked up to its full complement. Lymph supply. 3. The year's work was started on the 27th September with a supply of lanolinated lymph obtained from Mysore, and afterwards kept up by calf-to-calf or arm-to-calf vaccination as described in last year's report. Season's work. 4. The total number of operations perform- ed amounted to 125,289, or an increase of 5,178 over last year's figures. The figures for the two years are given below for each district( 2 ) Considering the famine distress which prevailed in 1897 as well as the high mortality of the year, the outturn of work may be regarded as satisfac- tory, especially in the backward district of Wun, where the increase attained this year of 5,173 operations reflects credit on Superintendent Mahadeo Bal- vant Deshpande and his vaccinators. Primary vaccination. 5. The number of primary operations amounted to 95,048 as compared with 98,594 in 1896-97. The decrease in primary work is attributable to the very high mortality amongst children as borne out by the figures of the Sanitary Report. The percentage of success in primary vaccination was 96.4 as compared with 96.8 in the previous year, and ranged from 98.3 in the Amraoti district to 94.1 in Ellichpur. The proportion of the population protected from small-pox by primary vaccination was 31.6 per mille( 3 ) Death-rate from small-pox. 9. The following prescribed diagram illustrates the death-rate from small- pox in each district as compared with the pro- portion of population protected by vaccination :( 4 ) The following table showing the efficiency of vaccination in diminishing small-pox is reproduced with the addition of another year's figures, which completes the sixth lustrum from the commencement of vaccination :( 5 ) The following statement compares the inspection work done by each Superintendent:( 6 ) District.

No. 753-R. OF 1899. FROM J. A. CRAWFORD, ESQ., Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts, To THE SECRETARY FOR BERAR TO THE RESIDENT, Hyderabad. Dated Amraoti, the 7th June 1899. SIR, I have the honour to submit the Sanitary Commissioner's Report on Vaccination for the year 1898-99, which reached me in print on the 4th instant. You have telegraphed for my review of the report; and I am pressed with other work before leaving Berar next week. 2. It appears from paragraph 3 of the report that the use of lanoline paste has been to some extent introduced in municipal towns ; but I cannot find that its use has been particularly considered or authorised as intended by the Resident. 3. The table in paragraph 4 of the report compares the work done during the last three years. Again there is a decrease (1,016) in primary vaccinations. It is attributed this time to the low birth-rate of the year, which resulted from the scarcity of the year before. The decrease occurred in. the Wun, Amraoti, and Ellichpur districts: in the others there was an increase. The percentage of success (97) is high. 4. The total of re-vaccinations again shows a large increase (8,630), which is spread over every district except Buldana. There is a decrease (1,181) in Buldana as a contrast to the considerable increase (2,459) of the year before. According to the Sanitary Report lately submitted, Buldana was the only district which suffered noticeably from small-pox in 1898-99. The Sanitary Commissioner found that &quot; the outbreak was chiefly confined to the grown-up children and adults for want of re-vaccination.&quot; The general percentage (23) of success, however, in re-vaccination is low; and this, it is remarked, &quot; goes to show that primary vaccination had been most efficiently carried out in former years.&quot; It is noteworthy that in the Sanitary Commis- sioner's opinion re-vaccination is less popular in Berar than primary vaccina- tion. The omission pointed out in the Government of India (Home Depart- ment) letter No. 4319, dated the 7th November last, has been corrected in this report. 5. All municipalities are subject to the compulsory Act, which is said to answer well. There were no prosecutions. Paragraph 13 of the report exhibits the work done in municipalities. The corresponding figures for the year before are not available; but in 1896-97 the outturn was rather larger. 6. Vaccination work in Berar seems to compare favourably with that of other provinces. There is a satisfactory list of those who render special assistance to the Department: no one is complained of; and six vaccinators are recommended for rewards.

CRAWFORD, ESQ., I.C.S., Officiating Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts. Dated Amraoti, the 29th April 1899. SIR, I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Resident, Report on Vaccination for the year 1898-99. Full report. 1. In accordance with Government of India, Home Department, Resolu- tion No.28/1579-95 of July 1887, a full report on the working of the department is submitted. Establishment. 2. The establishment worked up to its sanc- tioned strength as detailed below :( 2 ) From this it will be seen that though there was a decrease of 1,016 in primary vaccination as compared with the work of 1897-98, and of 4,562 com- pared with that of 1896-97, yet there was a considerable large increase in the number of re-vaccinations over that of both the previous years, viz., 8,630 and 17,154 respectively. Thus, the total vaccination work done during the year under report was in excess by 7,714 over that of the previous year, and by 12,592 over that of 1896-97. This increase was throughout the province, save Buldana district, where there was a small decrease of 345 compared with the previous year At the beginning of the year the outbreak of small-pox in the Buldana and other districts attracted my attention, and enquiries were instituted, which proved that the outbreak was chiefly confined to the grown-up children and adults for want of re-vaccination; and, as re-vaccination is not so popular in Berar as primary vaccination, vaccinators were not able to increase re-vacci- nation without the aid of the revenue authorities. Some of the Deputy Commissioners in the province were requested to supply for a limited period one tahsili peon to each vaccinator in their dis- tricts in order to assist him in collecting grown-up persons for re-vaccination. The vaccinators were also urged from time to time to increase re-vaccin- ation. The steps taken have evidently proved very successful in both promoting re-vaccination and stamping out the several outbreaks of small-pox. The amount of primary work depends entirely on the birth-rate. Last year, owing to the famine of the year previous affecting the fecundity of the population, the birth-rate was low, as will be seen from the following table; hence the decrease in primary work:( 3 ) Out of 94,032 primarily vaccinated, 91,286, or 97.1 per cent., were success- ful as compared with 96.4 in the previous year and 96.8 in 1896-97. The number of unsuccessful cases was 1,757, or 1.8 per cent., and the number of &quot;unknown&quot; cases 989, or 1.1 per cent. The percentage of success varied from 94.8 in Basim district to 98.3 in Amraoti. TABLE No. 4.( 4 ) Proportion of the population suc- cessfully protected. 8. The number of persons successfully vac- cinated per 1,000 of population is shown in the following table:( 5 ) Diagram showing the proportion of population protected during seven years ending 1898-99 and the death-rate from small-pox per 10,000 of population during the year 1898. The above diagram demonstrates very clearly the protection afforded by vaccination, and bears evidence to the efficiency of the work performed, B-228( 6 ) Sex. 9. Of the sexes vaccinated, 77,984 were males and 54,919 females, the proportion to the total vaccinated being for males 58.7 and females 41.3 as compared with 56.8 and 43.2 in the previous year, and 56.7 and 43.3 in 1896-97. Age. 10. Of the ages of those successfully vaccinated, 69,887 were infants. under one year of age ; 17,132 children between one to six, and 4,267 above 6 years and adults, giving a proportion of 76.5 per cent. of infants ; 18.8 children between one and six; and 4.7 of all other ages. The following table compares the ages of those successfully vaccinated for the past three years:( 7 ) respectively. The Superintendent of Amraoti was in very bad health in the last quarter, and subsequently died, and the Superintendent of Akola was ill with influenza; hence the decrease of work in these two districts. In regard to the total number verified, Superintendent Mahadeo Bulwant of the Wun district takes first place, followed by Superintendents Ramrattan of Akola district and Gangadhar of Basim district. In order of merit the work of District Superintendents stands as fol- lows :( 8 ) TABLE No. 12.( 9 ) Rewards to vaccinators. 16. The vaccinators cited hereunder did excellent work during the season, far above the average, and are recommended for rewards mentioned against their names:APPENDICES.

CAMP No. 990 OF 1900. FROM J. A. CRAWFORD, ESQ., Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts, To THE SECRETARY FOR BERAR TO THE RESIDENT, Hyderabad. Dated the 16th June 1900. SIR, I have the honour to submit the following remarks on the Sanitary Com- missioner's statements and notes relating to vaccination during the year 1899-1900, which reached my office in print on the 14th instant. 2. There has been a large increase both in primary vaccinations (26,740) and in re-vaccinations (16,258). The reasons mentioned in paragraph 7 of the notes explain the increase. The famine relief works offer great facilities for vaccination, and have attracted crowds from the Hyderabad State, where, I understand, vaccination is much less resorted to than in Berar. There is a marked decrease in the proportion of available infants who were protected. Many infants on relief works and elsewhere are in wretched condition and unfit to be vaccinated. 3. The arrangements for the manufacture of lanoline paste at a central depôt at Amraoti and its distribution in the districts seem to have been very economical and useful. Mr. Hollay, Superintendent of Vaccination, deserves credit in this connection. It may be noted that the percentage of success in operations with lanoline paste shows some falling off. There can be no doubt as to the protective efficacy of vaccination in Berar. 4. The work done in municipalities, all of which are subject to the com- pulsory Act, represents an increase of 2,161 primary cases and of 4,896 re- vaccinations. Relief works and poor-houses within municipal limits may account for some of this increase, In Khamgaon and Akot the outturn has decreased. 5. The average of work for each vaccinator (nearly 4,000 cases) is re- markably good, and the rewards recommended by the Sanitary Commissioner in paragraph 16 have been well earned by extraordinary efforts on the part of the six vaccinators mentioned. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, J. A. CRAWFORD, Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts. B-115TABLE OF CONTENTS. Paras.

Dated Amraoti, the 12th May 1900. SIR, Submission of Annual Vaccination Statements. I have the honour to submit the Annual Vaccination Statements for the year 1899-1900 with the following explanatory notes thereon. Strength of department. 2. The strength of the department remain- ed the same as in the previous year, and worked up to its full complement. Changes in supervision. 3. On March 25th, 1899, the department sustained a loss by the death of 1st Grade Superintendent Mr. Murad Ali of the Amraoti district, and was succeeded on April 1st by Head Vaccinator Sher Muhammad Khan as Superintendent of the 3rd grade. Season's work. 4. The total number of operations performed amounted to 175,901 during the year under report as against 132,903 in the year previous, showing an increase of 42,998. The figures for three years are given below for each district :( 2 ) Primary operations. 5. The number of primary operations rose from 94,032 to 120,772, showing an increase of 26,740. The percentage of success in primary vaccination was 95.8 as against 97.1 in the previous year. It ranged from 91.2 in Basim to 97.5 in Amraoti and Buldana districts. The proportion of population protected by primary vaccination was 43.2 against 34.6 in the previous year showing a satisfactory increase compared with other provinces. Re-vaccination. 6. The number of re-vaccination rose from 38,871 to 55,129. Percentage of successful cases decreased from 23.1 in the previous year to 17.2 in the year under report. Increase in both primary and re- vaccination work explained. 7. The large increase in primary work is due to the following causes:( 3 ) TABLE No 2.( 4 ) Diagram showing the proportion of population protected during seven years ending 1899-1900 and the death-rate from small-pox per 10,000 of population during 1899. The above diagram demonstrates very clearly the protection afforded by vaccination and bears evidence of the efficiency of the work done. Vaccination work in Berar compared with other provinces. 12. The result obtained in Berar compared with other provinces is given in the following table :( 5 ) It will be seen from the above table that Berar with a percentage of 95.8 successful primary cases takes the third place compared with the other provinces, while it takes the first place regarding the proportion of population protected from small-pox. Berar is also long way first regarding the average amount of work done by each vaccinator. Inspections. 13. The following table gives particulars of inspection work done by Super- intendents, and shows that 50.3 per cent. of the total number vaccinated were verified as com- pared with 55.6 in the previous year. The percentage ranged from 42.2 in Buldana to 57.2 in Amraoti district. Though the percentage is low in Buldana, the actual number of primary cases verified is higher than last year. Last year the Buldana Superintendent inspected 9,431 primary cases and this year 9,707.

I have great pleasure in recording the zeal and energy shown by Mr. Bakaram Pandurang Hollay, 1st grade Superin- tendent of Vaccination attached to my office, in carrying out most successfully and economically the manufacture of lanolinated lymph and making arrangements for its distri- bution to all vaccinators. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, C. L. SWAINE, M.D., M.C., D.P.H., LIEUTENANT-COLONEL, I.M.S., Sanitary Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts.

READ( 2 ) effective measures will be taken to vaccinate the large number of children: still in need of protection alike in their own and the public interests. In municipalities the number of infants vaccinated exceeded the number born and available for vaccination, and the rate of protection attained was as high as 52.3. 5. Mortality from small-pox in the Hyderabad Assigned Districts has again fallen from .2 to .1 per mille. The death-rate from this disease has never reached 1 per mille since 1883, but it is instructive to find that between 1868 and 1883 it sometimes rose to 3.6 and 3.8 per mille. Under these cir- cumstances it is not extraordinary that again this year the Vaccination Depart- ment met with no opposition in their work, and Colonel Barr has much pleasure in noting the names of the gentlemen mentioned by Colonel Swaine for having rendered valuable assistance, as also the services of Mr. Bukaram Pandurang Hollay in connection with the economical manufacture and dis- tribution of the lanoline lymph. 6. To the rewards recommended to the six vaccinators named in paragraph 16 of the Report sanction has been conveyed separately. The average outturn to the credit of each vaccinator in Berar is so largely in excess of that record- ed in any other province of India that the Resident is constrained to enquire whether there is not now some room for still further reduction in the average cost of each case.

CRAWFORD, ESQ., I.C.S., COMMISSIONER, HYDERABAD ASSIGNED DISTRICTS, Amraoti. Dated Amraoti, the 10th May 1901. SIR, Submission of Annual Vaccination statements. I have the honour to submit the Annual Vaccination Statements, with notes thereon, for the year 1900-01. Strength of Department. 2. The establishment worked up to its sanc- tioned strength, except one vaccinator in the Buldana district, who died while on cholera duty. Manufacture of lanolinated lymph. 3. From 1st April to the end of November lanolinated calf-lymph was manufactured at Amraoti, as owing to famine calves in sufficient numbers were not available to raise fresh calf-lymph. From December to the end of the official year fresh calf-lymph was used. Season's work. 4. The total number of operations performed amounted to 107,788 during the year under report as against 175,901 in the previous year, showing a decrease of 68,113. The figures for three years are given below for each district:( 2 ) The proportion of population protected by successful vaccination was 27.3 per 1,000 against 43.2 in the previous year, showing a decrease of 15.9. This is entirely due to famine causes ; but, in spite of this decrease, Berar is very little behind Bengal, the North-Western Provinces, Madras, and Bombay in this respect for 1899-1900. Re-vaccination. 6. The number of re-vaccination cases decreased from 55,129 to 33,081 and the percentage of success increased from 17.2 to 20.9 in the year under report. Decrease in primary work explained. 7. The large decrease in primary work is due to the following causes:( 3 ) TABLE No. 3.( 4 ) It will be seen from the table that there is an increase in the mortality from small-pox compared with the previous year. This was mostly in the Wun and Basim districts, where large numbers of unprotected people came in from the Hyderabad State. The diagram demonstrates very clearly the protection afforded by vacci- nation, and bears evidence of the efficiency of the work done. Vaccination work in Berar com- pared with other provinces. 13. The result obtained in Berar compared with other provinces is given in the following table :( 5 ) palities, the amount of primary work done was above the standard rate of 40 per 1,000 of population. The high rate of work in the municipalities of Amraoti Camp, Amraoti Town, and Shegaon is due to famine relief camps having been formed near the municipalities, which attracted a large number of destitute people, many of whom lived within the municipal limits.

Strength of the department. 1. The Department was able to work belowthe sanctioned strength of 45 owing to the use of lanolinated calf lymph. Manufacture of lanolinated lymph. 2. Lanolinated lymph was manufactured at Amraoti and used throughout the season, and gave a percentage of 96.6 suc- cessful primary cases similar to that of pure calf lymph used in the previous year. The cost of the lanolinated lymph was 3 annas and 3 pie per 100 children operated on ; and if we imported the lymph from the Bangalore Vaccine Institute, the cost would be Rs. 6 per 100.
