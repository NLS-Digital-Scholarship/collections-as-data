Extract from proceedings of the Cantonment Committee assembled on the 11th January, 1878. THE committee consider the medical officer's report very satisfactory, as showing a great diminution of venereal disease during the past year, an improvement attribu- table chiefly to the city having been placed out of bounds, and partly also to greater vigilance on the part of the cantonment police.

The history of venereal disease in Cawnpore points to one fact most prominently, viz., that the focus and chief factor is to be found in the city. The following instance is, I consider, overwhelming evidence in favour of this statement :( 4 ) Annual Statement No. I. of the Lock-Hospital at Cawnpore for the year 1877. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8.

From( 16 ) 11. There can, I fear, be little doubt that numbers of village women of the lowest classes have during the last eight months resorted to prostitution as a means of livelihood, and have spread disease among the European soldiers. Besides this it appears that a number of Kunjar women have been living in the Kalasi bazár in cantonments, who came in as married women, but who eventually turned out to be prostitutes. Their real character and position was not discovered, I am told, until the departure of the European regiment ; then the murder was out, but the mischief had been done. They have been expelled, and stricter watch will be necessary henceforward. When men can break out of barracks at night, as described by the medical officer, and cohabit with any women they can pick up in the bazárs or strolling about in search of the soldiers, there is little chance of checking venereal disease. 12. The committee commend the exertions of Dr. Triphook, and " consider it satisfactory that although the number of cases of disease among the men has increased, the number of cases among the women has decreased, and the type of the disease has assumed a milder form." 13. Two things appear to me to be necessary if the lock-hospital is to prove really beneficial :( 17 ) 4th.( 18 ) Thus the ratio of admissions per 1,000 for the years were:( 19 ) Numbers on the register. The number on the register at the end of 1876 was 89, the number added to the register 67, the number who removed their names or absconded 52, leaving a remainder of 104 on the register on the 31st Decem- ber, 1877, or an increase of 15 over the previous year. This is a slight improvement. 7. Registration fees.( 20) Regimental checks. Regimental police and patrols have been used during the year, and to a limited extent they act as checks, but, for reasons before mentioned, have not been very useful. Women are only allowed on "pass" into the barracks to sell food, &c., but outside the lines on the plain the women appear to enjoy opportunities of cohabiting with the men, as the latter say they get most of their disease from women who ply their trade in this locality. GENERAL SUMMARY. 1. Hospital accommodation is satisfactory. 2. The native staff, especially the native doctor, is efficient. 3.The admissions from venereal disease among the troops show an increase this year over the previous one. Thus there were 91 in 1877, against 71 in 1876, or an increase of 20 ; showing a ratio of admissions per 1,000 for 1877 of 126·6, against 89·4 in 1876. 4. The causes of this increase have been spoken of in the body of the report( 21 ) Annual Statement No. I. of the Lock-Hospital at Bareilly for the year 1877. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8.

( 23 ) ALLAHABAD. ANNUAL REPORT ON THE ALLAHABAD LOCK-HOSPITAL FOR 1877. 1. The Allahabad lock-hospital is situated in the Katra bazár in the civil station, between the old and new cantonments, about one mile from the former and two and a half from the latter. The hospital is in a good central position, and consists of a compound containing a row of nine small wards with a verandah in front. Each ward is supposed to contain two patients, and has a cubic space of 1,282 and a superficial of 192 feet, thus giving each patient 641 cubic and 95 super- ficial feet. 2. The accommodation is insufficient for the number of women on the register. The average daily number of patients for the year has been 22.59, while there is accom- modation only for 18. The wards are ventilated by open doorways only. 3. The establishment also contains an examination room, dispensary, cook-house, native doctor's room, servants' quarters, and an open verandah which is used as an office. There has been no change in any of the buildings during the year. 4. The medical officer during this period has been Surgeon-Major W. Ashton, M.B. 5. There has been a slight increase in the number of total admissions for venereal disease among the European troops in 1877 as compared with 1876, as will appear from the subjoined table; but 1876 was a singularly healthy year, and, with the excep- tion of it, 1877 will compare favourably with any year since the lock-hospital was established, while the admissions for syphilis have been much fewer than they ever were before.

The number of women on the register during the year has been on an average 129.73, much too small a number for such a large place and for such a large population; but the women have a great dislike to being registered, and evade it as much as possible. Attempts have been made from time to time to increase the number on the register, but have always met with great opposition, the women frequently employing lawyers to defend. 11. The area over which the lock-hospital rules extend includes the whole of the cantonments and the space enclosed by a line drawn round the cantonments at a distance of four miles. 12. No registration fees were levied. 13. The number of absentees from the weekly inspections during the year was 692. These were reported to the cantonment magistrate, and one was fined and seven imprisoned. The number reported includes women who were reported week after week for absence, until at last they were struck off the register. 14. The examinations are held weekly, both at the lock-hospital and at a small house in the city, and are conducted on consecutive days, so that a woman who may be unable to be present on one day can attend on the following, also for the convenience of those women who would have a long distance to travel if there were only one place for examination. 15.

It was resolved to forward the report to the district officer to be trans- mitted to the commissioner of the division for submission to the local Government. G. W. C. PLOWDEN, MAJOR, Cantt. Magte., and Secy., Cantt. Committee. ANNUAL REPORT ON THE LOCK-HOSPITAL AT MEERUT FOR 1877. No. 6, dated Meerut, the 17th January, 1878. From( 29 ) A.( 30 ) B.( 31 ) "The city registration is merely nominal, and there I understand a distinction is made between public women frequented by European soldiers and those not so fre- quented, and only the former class is registered. "As I have often pointed out, it would be unreasonable to expect satisfactory results when the city women are unregistered, as from its proximity to the bazárs it is easy for the women to visit the bazárs, or for the men to go to the city; and as one aspect of this question between the parties, and the chief one, is of a commercial nature, the rules regarding supply and demand will be found to hold good." The area of registration embraces the city and all villages within four miles of cantonment boundaries, and thus extends to a population of some 130,000 people. On 1st January there were 86 women on the register, and on 31st December last 85. The average registered strength for the year 1877 was 84.10, including the city registered women, and for 1876 it was 92.71. There was therefore no increase dur- ing 1877. Those registered in the city gave a monthly mean strength of 16.58, and in the cantonments of 67.52( 32 ) Last year the female admissions were 79, or little more than half the number of 1876; and the patients were 51, instead of 75 in the previous year. In 1876 the female syphilitic admissions were 37 and the gonorrh( 33 ) No. II.( 34 ) No. IV.( 35 ) No. 177A, dated Meerut, the 15th, February, 1878. From( 36 ) 3. The percentage of admission to hospital among the European troops, viz. 47.8, shows that nearly half of them have suffered from some form of syphilis at one time or other during the year. 4. The large number of admissions among the prostitutes, viz. 167, the average strength being 71, was due to the precaution taken by the medical officer in sending to hospital women who were only slightly affected, in order to check the spread of the disease. Remarks by the Cantonment Committee. THE number of women on the register at the end of 1877 appears to have been 65, a falling off of 9 from the previous year. The average number attending the periodical examinations was 50.3, those not attending are accounted for as en leave, excused on account of sickness, and absent without leave. The number of the latter was 56, or an average of two absentees at each inspection ; for, as stated by the medical officer in charge, some of the women were examined oftener than twice a month; the attendance is therefore considered satisfactory. Twenty-three women absconded during the year and 19 withdrew their names, but several of these, as also of those who absconded, were brought back or returned of their own accord, and were re-entered on the register during the year. On a woman being absent without leave for 15 days she is struck off the register as absconded. There were 20 fresh entries during the year ; most of them were sent up by the police, but in a few instances voluntarily presented themselves for registration. Fifteen women were punished for breach of lock-hospital rules. The number seems small, but the canton- ment magistrate explains that in all cases of first offences the women were merely warned ; those punished were all fined, with the exception of one woman who was sent to jail in default of payment. The amount of fines realized was Rs. 20-8-0, the highest fine levied being Rs. 5, and the lowest 8 annas. The sub-committee has held its meetings regularly throughout the year, and the regimental arrangements have been the same as heretofore. The disease among the European troops would appear from the report of the medical officer to have increased since last year, notwithstanding every effort to suppress it, but there is no increase in proportion to the strength of Europeans.

(46) superficial kind, and very different to those in the men in hospital; the women complained that the men got diseased by unregistered prostitutes, and in some bases gave information where these women were to be found. Fifteen such prostitutes were taken by the hospital peons during the months of August and September, several others were seized by the cantonment police, all actually found with soldiers. When examined they were in every case found diseased, some of them having very severe forms of syphilis. Much more might have been done in this way, had it not been that these hospital peons were not allowed to enter any house in their search for prostitutes. So if a woman chose to receive men under a roof she was safe from detection. The peons came to know of several houses in. which prostitutes plied their trade, but they could not interfere. With so many diseased women all through and around cantonments, ready to prosti- tute for the merest trifle of money, disease among the men was a very natural result. Extension of registration, increased power given to the hospital peons, and greater protection to them would tend to do away with this evil. It would be better that they should be regularly entertained as police, for at present they are constantly liable to hard treatment from soldiers who find their female friends watched by them, and they have not the protection of a uniform. 4. A lock-hospital committee has existed and has met regularly. 5. In the 14th Regiment there were frequent venereal inspections, and any man found diseased was severely punished for concealing his disease. This was to force the men to come to hospital at once on appearance of any venereal affection, and they were then desired to, if possible, point out the woman in the chakla with whom they last had connection. Such a woman was at once removed to the lock-hospital for examina- tion; in very few instances had women so pointed out any corresponding complaint. Two detective peons were constantly at work watching for unauthorized prostitution, and were most useful, though, as noted above, their usefulness might be very easily increased by giving them greater scope. 6. Registration has been effectual so far as it has gone; there was a larger number of women on the register this year than in 1876. 7. No. 8. Have been very regular. 9. The women were brought to hospital weekly and examined by me personally; every now and then extra inspections were made. 10. Disease among the registered women very mild in type. 11.

Among British troops venereal disease was confined to the 1-6th Regiment. Thirty were admitted, of whom six contracted the disease at Delhi. The weekly returns have been received regularly, and a general statement prepared from them is annexed. 4. A cantonment sub-committee has existed throughout the year, composed of the officer commanding the 6th Regiment, the senior medical officer, British forces, and the cantonment magistrate. 5. Regimental police exercise some control over prostitution, and prevent unre- gistered women from entering their lines. 6. Registration extends to those women who are known to admit Europeans, and is in force for five miles round cantonments. There is no appreciable difference in the number registered as compared with last year. 7. No registration fees have been levied. 8. The women have been remarkably regular at the periodical examinations. One failed to attend on one occasion, and was fined one rupee. 9. The registered women of the city and cantonment are examined and treated in the lock-hospital by the medical officer in charge. 10. Referring to statement No. II., the number of admissions among the women is 23, against 11 last year.

A cantonment sub-committee has been assembled once every month, consist- ing of the officer commanding the station, the senior medical officer, with the officer in medical charge of the lock-hospital attending. All the public prostitutes have been directly under the surveillance of the police authorities ;the regulations and rules laid down for the prevention of venereal disease and control of the brothel houses were strictly carried out. The women were not allowed to wander about the cantonment, but were confined to the bazárs. Unlicensed prosti- tutes were- also confined to the bazars, and punished if detected. Care was also taken by the regimental police to prevent strange or suspicious characters entering the lines. 6. The average number of prostitutes on the register during the eleven months under report was 23.7. The number removed from the register and who left the station from various causes was four. There was one death during the eleven months in a woman who had an enlarge- ment of the spleen, out of hospital. The classes or castes of women were all Muhammadans. 7. There were no registered fees levied during the eleven months under notice. 8. The women were regular in attendance at the periodical examinations. 9. The examinations were held in a closed room with the greatest circumspection and propriety, and attention was also paid so as not to wound the feelings of the pros- titutes. 10. Venereal diseases have decidedly decreased among the women and were all less virulent in type, and soon recovered under treatment without manifesting secondary symptoms. It was also noticed that the men likewise rapidly recovered under treat- ment. I consider that there was a relation between the sex in the propagation of the disease directly from cohabitation. There were no admissions into hospital from non- venereal affections. 11. A dhai or matron was employed with satisfactory results. 12. No suggestions. 13. The average strength of the British troops at this station has been 773 during the eleven months of this report. W. M. MITCHELL, APOTHECARY, 62ND REGT., In medical charge of Lock-hospital.

Extract from the proceedings of the Jhánsi Cantonment Committee, assembled at the Cantonment Magistrate's Office at 11 A.M. on the 8th January, 1878, agreeably to station orders dated 5th January, 1878. 2. The annual lock-hospital report for the year 1877 is read to the committee, who consider it very satisfactory. Mr. Judd's report being ample and explicit, the committee do not consider it necessary to add to it or to make any suggestions, and it is ordered to be forwarded to the deputy commissioner in due course. R. ANNESLEY, MAJOR, Cantonment Magistrate. ANNUAL REPORT ON THE LOCK-HOSPITAL AT JHÁNSI FOR 1877. 1. THE lock-hospital at Jhánsi is situated about a mile from the European infan- try lines, at the entrance to a small village outside the boundary pillars called New Jhánsi. It is in close proximity to the civil dispensary and near the road leading to it; it is in position, with regard to the cantonment, the most suitable which could be selected, admitting of an amount of privacy, under efficient police supervision, which could not well be procured elsewhere in the station ; the building has ample accommo- dation for the number of patients likely to require it at any one time, and is supplied with a sufficiency of medicines, surgical instruments, and furniture. 2. From the 1st to the 11th of January 2nd Class Hospital Assistant Kalka Das held medical charge of the lock-hospital, Assistant Apothecary J. H. Shore being in charge from the 12th January to the 3rd February, when it reverted to the hospital assistant in consequence of Mr. Shore having been detailed for detachment duty. On the 15th of March the hospital came under my charge. 3. The extent of venereal disease which occurred amongst the European troops during the year is shown in the following table :( 75 ) No record of the amount of venereal disease in Her Majesty's 63rd Regiment during the year 1876 being in the lock-hospital, no comparison can be made as to whether the admissions last year were in excess or otherwise. 4. The cantonment sub-committee during the year consisted of( 76 ) left by a venereal ulcer, and rendering detection of actual disease difficult ; the orifice and lining membrane of the vagina showed signs of having been intensely diseased at various times. On her discharge from hospital, as she expressed a wish to relinquish her profession, I strongly recommended that her wishes should be acceded to. She has since resided out of the cantonment, but if I was permitted to hazard an opinion, the greater number of admissions for venereal disease since she left might be traced to her. The second, a prostitute residing in the sudder bazar, had had frequent admis- sions from primary disease. There appears in the register of examinations for 1876 a woman of the same name, but who for some reason withdrew at the latter part of that year ; should she be the same person, then, as last year, she was seldom out of hospital. The clitoris in this case was abnormally elongated and pendulous, and secretions could lie unconsciously within the folds until disease was either induced in herself or in the individual cohabiting with her. She also expressed a wish to retire, which was complied with. It is noteworthy that on the departure of these two women in March the disease amongst the European soldiers began to decrease, nor has disease of much conse- quence appeared since in the prostitutes who remained. The following table of admissions for venereal disease amongst the women will show the decrease since that period :( 77 ) Annual Statement No. I. of the Lock-Hospital at Jhánsi for 1877. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8.

As above stated, disease has greatly decreased, and the unregistered women who have done so much mischief are (vide Dr. Fairland's para. 67) not city prostitutes, but Kunjurs, field labourers, &c. 7. Dr. Fairland appears to have been most successful in almost stamping out serious disease among the registered women. Major Horsford, Cantonment Magistrate, refers to three other classes who are especially dangerous( 81 ) 5. Nothing was done until the other day, when rules were framed by the Canton- ment Magistrate in consultation with myself. These rules were altered by myself and the Deputy Commissioner in two sections, and sent on to Government for sanction. 6. The rules provide that all ministerial work shall be done by the Cantonment Magistrate, all detective and judicial by the City Magistrate and City Sup erintendent. The Deputy Commissioner consents to transfer detective and judicial power to Major Horsford only, and he is to work through the city police only. 7. The last point is important, for, if I understand Dr. Fairland's report cor- rectly, the procedure in cantonment is illegal. It is not legal in India or in England for the police to send an unregistered and unconvicted woman of their own motion to the lock-hospital ; it is illegal to examine her there, and illegal to detain her there. 8. In the city such power could not be safely intrusted to any police. It would be monstrous to expose respectable women, asked, for instance, the way by a soldier, to the risk of being introduced to the hospital subordinate with his tenderness and his speculum. The 21st March, 1878. F. M. NEWBERY, CAPTAIN, City Magistrate. MEMO. I HAVE read this report with much pleasure, as on the whole it is a gratifying record, and I am glad to be able again to offer my cordial thanks to Staff Surgeon Fairland and his native hospital assistant. The fact, however, that not a single case of syphilis (para. 21) had been discov- ered amongst the registered women, whilst 128 cases are recorded (last table) amongst the troops, affords the best of reasons for believing that the unregistered women find much favour, and that they are the chief causes of disease. In the case of the Royal Artillery in Fort Mai Bhawun this is specially true, and unfortunately there is no remedy, as the prostitutes in the city and Aminabad and the suburbs are free from all medical control and supervision. To this the fright- ful condition of the ratio of disease (506 per 1,000) bears testimony, and if figures and facts are self-asserting, surely it must now be admitted that a city lock-hospital is a necessity. The military authorities, including medical, administrative and executive officers, most earnestly protested against the closing of that institution, and induced the muni- cipality to continue the expense, pending the orders of Government. For the condi- tion of affairs as shown in the Royal Artillery, I submit that no blame can in any way be attached to the local military authorities. The Sanitary Commissioner, in his review on the lock-hospital reports for 1876, ascribes (para. 94) the ill-success of our operations in Lucknow " plainly to the oppor- " tunities accorded to the soldiers for visiting unregistered women." My answer is that it is impossible to confine the Royal Artillerymen in the fort to its defences, or even to the limits of the glacis, and that practically no substantial remedy exists against the spread of disease, &c. Doubtlessly they consort with the women who once were registered, but they cannot guard against disease ; and unless a lock-hospital be re-opened in the city, it is hard to say to what extent disease may not increase. With the troops in cantonment there is a difference, and at times stringent mea- sures have been used with particular regiments. I am very confident that much of our trouble arises from European and Eura- sian women who live on the borders of cantonments. To remedy the evil I have placed their locality( 82 ) I admit that it has not been the rule to interfere with the men's liberty when disease is trivial, and I think few will hold it advisable to make already irksome and monotonous lives doubly irksome, thus driving men to drink, when the adoption of liberal expenditure is far more certain to eradicate the evil which constriction of limits will not do. But I appeal to reports of other years to show that action has constantly been taken, and at times the city and suburbs have been out of bounds. Whilst writing this report I have learnt of a sudden burst of disease int he 73rd and 87th Regiments, and have restricted all European soldiers to the canal boundary until further orders. This, I trust, will, with the aid of the civil authorities, lead to the exodus of the Anglican fire ships who are credited with the mischief. The Sanitary Commissioner alludes to rules in force at Cawnpore or Fyzabad (paras. 6 and 78). As regards the latter, I have the authority of the medical officer in charge of that city lock-hospital for stating that he did not think the reduction of venereal disease was due in marked degree to the city being out of bounds. Further, he assured me that the order for placing it was based upon the constant dangers which the men would run of catching various diseases from the never-ending stream of pilgrims passing to and from Ajudhia. With reference to the Sanitary Commissioner's remarks anent soldiers of this garrison " wandering in the city at night time," I am satisfied he misunderstood Surgeon-Major Fairland's remarks. In primis, I emphatically deny that any such custom has ever been authorized or has obtained during my tenure of command, and I crave on behalf of my predecessors equal freedom from any such state of indiscipline. The remarks in Staff Surgeon Fairland's report were, I believe, only applicable to the very early hours of evening and only to the suburbs immediately bordering on canton- ment. As it makes a very material difference to all concerned in preserving discipline as to whether soldiers have or have not been allowed to roam at will, I desired in a public manner as possible to correct the erroneous impressions which may have been formed on reading the Sanitary Commissioner's report. I have abstained from reviewing Staff Surgeon Fairland's report because it is so good that it had best speak for itself; but I wish to make one more remark upon the Sanitary Commissioner's report, relative to his proposal to augment the number of can- tonment prostitutes up to about 230. The 144 now on the rolls and those who have been on it for three years have long and bitterly complained about the preference by the soldiers to the unregistered women. If then (so to say) the horse will not drink the well water provided for him, pure and unadulterated, and prefers foul water, muddy and dirty, of what use will it be to add another hundred women to those who can hardly gain a livelihood. Doubtless many of the present ones would desert in quest of better fields. In former reports it has been pointed out how many men will not in a cold- blooded fashion seek woman's society in presence of many who know the exact errand he is bent on, and they prefer running risks elsewhere with the probability of liquor combined. I claim for all administrative and executive officers in this command considerable praise for the unremitting exertions in endeavouring to guard their men against disease, but when I consider that their endeavours are almost as futile " as those of Tantalus," I am not astonished at their comparative ill success. R. CHAMBERLAIN, LIEUT.-GENL., Commanding Oudh Division. Lucknow, the 20th February, 1878.
( 83 ) MEMO. I HAVE only a few remarks to make on the careful and interesting report of Staff Surgeon Fairland, A.M.D. 1. It would have been more satisfactory in comparing the ratio of admissions per 1,000 of strength in 1877 with previous years, had the facts of the 65th Regiment being removed from Lucknow early in November been taken with the calculation. Had that regiment remained the entire year, the number of admissions would have been greater( 84 ) Hindustani Musslmans, who furnish five of the recent admissions into the 6th Regi ment Native Infantry. It remains yet, therefore, an undiscovered reason for the prevalence in one regi- ment and a comparative absence in the other. Lucknow, the 27th February, 1878. J. A. S. HUTCHINSON, M.D., Depy. Surgn.-Genl., I.F., Lucknow Circle. MEMO. ON LOCK-HOSPITAL REPORT FOR 1877. IT appears to me that, disease is contracted from three different classes of unregistered women.:( 85 ) the good results arising from the supervision in cantonments empowered by the Con- tagious Diseases Act, and also in the harm that has resulted from the closing of the lock-hospital in the city. In a large and populous town like Lucknow venereal will exist even under the strictest supervision ; without such it must do so to a large and ever increasing extent. Such being the case, a lock-hospital at once suggests itself as one of the least expensive and most simple means by which the progress of the disease may in a manner be checked. It is not to be supposed that all affected women would avail themselves of the institution ; but if even only a very few of their number did so, it is hard to say how many cases of disease would thereby be avoided. The matter is one that demands the most serious attention of those in authority, and in my opinion the "Act" should be extended to the city. If that cannot be done, then by all means let the lock-hospital there be re-opened. ANNUAL REPORT ON THE LOCK-HOSPITAL AT LUCKNOW CAN- TONMENTS FOR THE YEAR 1877. 1. Hospital arrangements.( 86 ) sions amongst the soldiers, it is fair to assume that these labours have fully borne out the good promise of past experience. 6. Each regiment has also had its corps of soldier-police, who have at times been instrumental in capturing unlicensed prostitutes. 7. Perhaps the best measure of all has been the unceasing vigilance exercised by all concerned in watching any increase in the number of admissions amongst the troops, and then taking immediate steps to ascertain the cause of such increase. In cases where it has been discovered and proved that the men have consorted with unregistered prostitutes, speedy retribution has followed on their lapse from virtue. 8. By order of the Lieutenant-General Commanding, all detachments of men arriving in the division are at once medically inspected for the purpose of discover- ing the existence amongst them of cases of venereal disease. This is a most salutary measure, and has had the result of showing correctly how many cases of disease are contracted before the men arrive in the command. 9. All cases of concealment of disease are also severely punished. I believe this rule has had the effect of checking a practice which until recent times was rather a common one, and which often produced the most baneful results in the constitutions of the men practising it. 10. Registration.( 87 ) 19 In 1875 there were 506 admissions, and in 1876 there were 424 admissions. 20 Out of 51 women who have been brought to hospital for examination and registration 34 have been found to be diseased ; and of these 34, 11 have been suffer- ing from primary syphilis. 21 Diseases of the women. ( 88 ) 32. In 1876 there were 600 admissions, a percentage to strength of 25·7 ; in 1877 there have been 356 admissions, a percentage to strength of 15·2 (see statement on last page). 33. This is a very material diminution, and should be considered as a strong. encouragement for a persistence in the lock-hospital system. 34. For purposes of comparison I have taken a table from the Army Medical Department blue-book for 1873 (the latest in my possession), showing the prevalence of venereal disease at 14 stations in England, in which the Contagious Diseases Preven- tion Act is in force. 35. Table showing the admissions into hospital for primary venereal sores and gonorrh( 89 ) 38. A comparison of column 5 of table D. with column 2 of table C. shsow marked decrease in the admissions to hospital during the period of five years from 1873( 90 ) the detection and punishment of such prostitution ; we need rules and regulations, distinct and salutary, for the punishment of soldiers consorting with unregistered pros- titutes.; and lastly, we need a grant from the Imperial Exchequer to enable the authorities to feel that their hands are not cramped and fettered, as regards financial considerations, in dealing with a subject which requires and demands the expenditure of both time and money, to enable those entrusted with its management to secure a satisfactory termination to their labours. 46 In Lucknow especially the difficulty of suppressing illicit prostitution has long been a sad hindrance to successful administration, and latterly the difficulty has been increased a thousand-fold by the abolition of the city lock-hospital. 47 The abolition of the city lock-hospital.( 91 ) 54. Now, if this subject be worked out to its logical conclusion, we shall not be much beyond the mark in assuming that the small force of men quartered in the fort will soon, in the number of its admissions, eclipse the garrison of cantonments altogether. 55. Influence upon the troops in cantonments.( 92 ) to the fact that all the 94 cases occurring in the 6th Regiment Bengal Light Infantry are said to have been contracted in Aminabad, a populous suburb of Lucknow much frequented by the European troops. 64.

Gonorrh( 95 ) During this year several changes and, I consider, improvements have been made in the allotment of the various portions of the building, all tending to the increase of the comfort of the inmates. The large and very roomy inspection chamber at the south end of the hospital I have given up to the sick women as a ward, as the heretofore existing condition of things by which the patients were located in a low and open verandah in the courtyard was quite unsuitable. I have made a new inspection room out of a spare room near the dispensary. The comfort to the inmates from this change, by which they escape the fierce heats of the hot weather and the cold of the winter season, must be considerable, and I cannot conceive how the previous custom existed so long. The hospital in every part has been thoroughly ventilated by lattice brickwork openings. Terraces in front of the present main ward and in front of the offices have been erected. Chiks have been supplied for all openings. Grass plats have been made in the courtyard. A punkah has been put up in the inspection room. A screen, as in continental hospitals, has been hung up over the inspection table, by which the patient is saved from much unnecessary exposure. The building has been limewashed throughout. There is still, however, one weak point in this hospital : there is no residence on the spot for the native hospital assistant in charge of the hospital, and owing to this there is a weak link in the chain of responsibility which should exist between the medical officer and the lowest servant of the hospital. A suitable site for such a building as a native hospital assistant would need exists, and I have drawn the atten- tion of the sub-committee to the subject. 2. Medical charge.( 96 ) for the same disease in a like period. For several months the European battalion, a strong corps of vigorous young men, had not a single admission for primary syphilis, and the artillery battery had but a total of seven venereal admissions in ten months of residence. To what are these good results to be attributed? I would deal with the probable causes in order. (a.) The sanitary arrangements of the brothels I have constantly watched over( 97 ) During the year, for a time, medical inspections of the soldiers were held once a week at a regulated hour in the barrack-room. I attach the least, the faintest importance to such routine inspections. Syphilis is very, rarely concealed by soldiers, and I have never yet seen a case so detected.

The disease in the 92nd Highlanders (240.08 per 1,000) is high, but Dr. Curran gives the ratio of disease actually contracted at Sitapur at 227.84. I have no doubt that a great deal of the disease is contracted from unregistered. women beyond cantonment limits. 3. Dr. Curran has not included returns of the E-5th battery in his report. Had he done so, the ratio would have been considerably reduced. I have since received a memo from him showing the disease in the battery as 160.85 per 1,000, which for the whole year for the battery gives a ratio of 211.75 per 1,000. 4. With reference to the General's remarks regarding the legality of examin- ing unregistered women, Dr. Curran explains that his remarks referred only to exami- ation of registered prostitutes who were accused by soldiers of having diseased them. 5. The cantonment committee propose that Government should in some way pro- vide for incurable and imbecile prostitutes. The women in question are not fit subjects for admission into the lunatic ayslum. We have tried to keep such women in the poor- house, but they refuse to remain there. 6. Statement No. II. shows that a large number of the registered women were under treatment in the lock-hospital. An examination of the statement will show that a very large proportion of these women were not suffering from any venereal disease. T. BEDFORD, Supdt., Commissioner's Office. ANNUAL REPORT ON THE LOCK-HOSPITAL AT SITAPUR FOR 1877. Hospital accommodation, inspection, and establishment( 102 ) servants, &c., of the establishment hard by. These several structures are under the con- trol of the resident dhai and chaukidar; they are visited daily by the native doctor on duty, and I can testify from frequent personal inspection that the general surround- ings and economy of the building are in a good sanitary state. A sub-committee of the standing station sanitary board, of which the deputy commissioner is an ex-officio member, visits the institution once a month, when any representations I may consider it my duty to make are considered or recorded; and the following table so fully describes, the accommodation available for hospital purposes as to preclude the necessity of my going into further detail on the point in this place:( 103 ) Surgeon, and myself, and the following was the morning state of the same.

( 108 ) Table No. 10.( 109 ) Table No. 11.( 110 ) broadcast, almost, it may be said, through no fault of their own. Their very helpless- ness or incurable maladies ought of themselves to establish a claim for them, in a country like this, on the consideration of Government, and their want of cleanliness as well as their promiscuous mode of indulgence are peculiarly favourable to the development of the diseases here contemplated. It is not too much to say that they have been already the cause of a good deal of mischief of this kind in this very garrison, and I am of opinion that one woman of this class is more dangerous in herself alone than a dozen of her cleaner or more discriminating sisters. The British soldier is, as we all know, not very particular in the distribution of his amorous patronage. He selects his partners, without fear or favour, in the darkness of the night, as well as under the shadow of a tree or within the shelter of a corn-field or a nala. He likes variety, but dislikes paying much for it, and there is reason to believe that he is not altogether averse to the kind of pariah gratification afforded by these women. Anyhow there is evidence to show that they are unable to compete on equal terms with their sisters, they have therefore to go elsewhere, to the jungle or the common. They are frequently much more so than their neigh- bours diseased, and I am of opinion that such women as I have described above should be no longer allowed to roam at large, as they do at present, in this or any other military cantonment. There can be no reasonable doubt that, as noticed by one of my predecessors, "the women convicted of unlicensed prostitution sent up for examination will gener- ally be found to be suffering from a more virulent form of disease than those who were regular attendants," and the reasons for this are so obvious as to dispense me from the necessity of doing more in this place than dwelling on the claims of the latter to protection, and insisting on the necessity of improving or extending the detec- tive system now in force. I am aware that rewards are supposed to be given to these men when they succeed in catching an unlicensed woman with a European soldier, but they are, I fear, too small, if indeed they are disbursed at all, to counteract the other influences that are or can be brought to bear on these officials; and taking into account the odium that must necessarily attach to such a duty, I would strongly recom- mend the institution of a regularly graduated tariff of fees for these services. The dhaies, and even the registered prostitutes themselves, might be included in the same list( 111 ) also be included, and medical officers are now so liable to change that no one man can be sure of being left in charge of this or of any other local institution of the kind for even a year. Facts of military and medical interest are constantly accumu- lating in connection with these establishments which it is desirable to preserve and collate, and this can only be done after the fashion here recommended, The very nature and origin of syphilis are, notwithstanding all that has been written about them, still moot questions, and it should not be forgotten that these women are themselves incapable of affording any reliable information on these points. They are above reproach, or so callous to shame as to be indifferent to the consequences of their conduct, and the restraint to which they are subjected affords facilities for clinical study and observation which have no parallel elsewhere in our dominions. For these and other reasons too numerous or too technical for mention here, I venture to suggest as abov( 112 ) P.S.( 113 ) CAWNPORE. 2. During the year 1877 a monthly average of 135 women remained on the register against 145 in 1876. 3. The result of the management has been very satisfactory. The ratios of admissions to hospital amongst the garrison from venereal disease for the four years 1874-77 have been 439.5, 266.0, 201.9, and 212.37 per 1,000 of strength respectively. 4. The medical officer reports that of a total of 175 cases of venereal disease which appeared amongst the European garrison at Cawnpore during the past year, thirty-eight cases were contracted elsewhere than at Cawnpore, forty-nine cases were contracted from unregistered women lurking at night time about the roads and can- tonments and in the city, and six cases were relapses of disease; the remaining eighty- two cases were, the medical officer thinks, contracted from the registered women. All women practising prostitution are registered, whether living in the city or in cantonments. The medical examinations are conducted by the medical officer of the lock-hospital as regards the women living in cantonments, by the civil-surgeons as regards women living in the city. If any woman is found diseased in the city she is sent to the lock-hospital for treatment. The city is out of bounds to the European garrison, so that the disease discovered there is of less importance to the troops now than formerly, and especially as many of those city women who formerly received the visits of soldiers have removed into cantonments. The prevalence of syphilis amongst the women was less in 1877 than in 1876, but the prevalence of gonorrh( 114 ) the scarcity which has prevailed in the district, large numbers of starving women were driven to practise unlicensed prostitution, and the soldiers contracted disease from these women. The medical officer thinks the discontinuance during the year of the previously existing practice of detaining women in hospital during their periods of menstruation may account for some cases of gonorrh( 115 ) the improper behaviour of soldiers in breaking out of barracks at night time to have sexual intercourse with village and other women in the bazárs; the negligent perform- ance of their duties by the police and regimental police. The medical officer regrets the failure of progressive improvement as evidenced by the facts of the past year, but is persuaded that this failure was due to exceptional causes, and, above all, to the prevalent distress. The causes of failure were laid before the cantonment sub-committee from time to time as they occurred. The detective police are described as old men who cannot run, and consequently can catch neither offending menor women. The regimental police are described as not approving the rules, which are considered tyrannical by soldiers. The position of the detective dhaie is described as hard, as she is threatened by soldiers and women, and being little paid, has every incentive to take dasturi and neglect her duties. The medical officer is satisfied that the prevalence of disease was due in greatest measure to illicit prostitution, and not to the prevalence of disease amongst the regis- tered women, who have been carefully examined and managed; but these women are described as old, ugly, and scarred by disease. Amongst the registered women 79 cases of syphilis and 53 cases of gonorrh( 116 ) MEERUT. 19. During the year 1877 a monthly average of 84 women remained on the register against 93 in 1876. The results of the management have been satisfactory. For the five years 1873 to 1877 the ratios of venereal cases amongst the European garrison per 1,000 at Meerut have been 98, 179, 159, 84, and 144 respectively. 20. The medical officer reports that of the total of 204 cases of venereal disease which occurred amongst the soldiers 78 were contracted at places other than Meerut, or were relapses or secondary affections. Deducting these the ratios for 1877 will be reduced to 88 per 1,000 of strength. The medical officer again records the opinion that the registration of the Meerut city women is merely nominal, and such being the case, so long as the soldiers were allowed to visit the city, or the city women to enter cantonments, it will be unreason- able to expect very satisfactory results. The monthly average of city women registered was only 17. Disease amongst the women was much less in 1877 than in 1876. In the former year 139 cases of disease occurred, in the latter 102 cases. Only cases of venereal disease proper are admitted to hospital. The disease seen was more virulent in 1877, requiring an average of 56 days' treatment for the cure of each case, while in 1876 the average was 30 days. Amongst the women cases of syphilis and gonorrh( 117 ) the necessary information on this point as regards the soldiers, the usual statement on this subject, received from Benares, not showing the cases of disease Separately. Two or three good-looking registered women prone to disease were a cause of disease to the soldiers. 26 The cantonment committee record that 20 new women were registered during the year, 15 women were punished for breach of lock-hospital rules, and all cases of first offence were taken notice of, the women being warned by the cantonment magistrate. The sub-committee held its meetings regularly throughout the year, and the regi- mental arrangements have been the same as before. 27 The magistrate notes the fact that nearly half the soldiers of the garrison suffered from some form of venereal disease during the year. 28 The commissioner forwards the papers with the remark that his views on the subject are contained in previous annual reports. MORADABAD. 29 During the year 1877 a monthly average of 57 women remained on the register at Moradabad against 51 in 1876. The results of the management have been satisfactory. For the five years 1873-77 the ratios of cases of venereal disease amongst the European soldiers of the garrison have been 168, 166, 162, 98, and 115. 30 The medical officer reports that the location of the lock-hospital in the city is inconvenient, and makes a strict supervision difficult. He thinks the building should be isolated and near to the cantonments. The medical officer recommends the employment of police inspectors for the investigation and punishment of breaches of the lock-hospital rules, as very few of the women who practise unlicensed prostitution with the soldiers are arrested or punished. Amongst the women 15 cases of disease occurred; amongst these the serious cases were those of women who had been found practising unlicensed prostitution. 31 The officer commanding the station forwards the papers without remark. RANIKHET. 32 During the year 1877 a monthly average of 35 women remained on the register against 26 in 1876. The results of the management have been very unsatisfactory. For the four years 1874-77 the ratio of cases of venereal disease amongst the soldiers of the European garrison have been 175, 143, 52, and 381 per 1,000 respectively. 33 The medical officer reports that a new ward was added to the lock-hospital during the year, and the building was roofed with iron. The great increase of disease was due to the sexual intercourse of the soldiers with unregistered women. The regis- tered women complained of this unlicensed intercourse, and 15 unlicensed prostitutes were arrested by the two lock-hospital peons during the months of August and Septem- ber, and several more such women found with soldiers were arrested by the canton- ment police. When examined all these unlicensed women were found to be diseased, some having very severe forms of syphilis. Many more such women might have been arrested but that the hospital peons were not allowed to arrest a woman in a house. So that all unlicensed women who received the soldiers under a roof were safe from detection and the peons were liable to hard treatment by the soldiers whilst performing their duties of detection. Very little of the disease from which the soldiers suffered was contracted from the registered women, whose diseases were of a very mild type, whilst the diseases of the men were virulent. The 14th Regiment formed part of the garrison. This regiment came from Sitapur and Benares. 34 The cantonment magistrate, in forwarding the report, states that in the opinion of the cantonment committee some portion of the increase of venereal disease
( 118 ) during the year was due to the fact that many of the wives of the camp-followers of the 22nd Regiment had intercourse with the soldiers. These women were found to be diseased and were removed from cantonments. ROORKEE. 35 During the year 1877 a monthly average of 20 women remained on the register against 21 in 1876. The results of the management have been most satisfactory. For the four years 1874-77 the ratios of cases of venereal disease amongst the Euro- pean soldiers of the garrison have been 198, 146, 124, and 66 per 1,000 respectively. 36 The medical officer reports that of the 30 cases of disease which occurred amongst the soldiers 6 were contracted at Delhi, and of the cases which commenced at Roorkee were probably not often derived from registered women; for whilst amongst the women the prevailing disease was syphilis, amongst the men the prevailing disease was gonorrh( 119 ) 45 The medical officer reports that the number of cases of venereal disease would indeed have been less amongst the European troops but for the happening of several cases contracted from unlicensed women at the musketry camp six miles from the station. The women were apprehended. The regimental police prevented &#347;trange or suspicious women from entering the lines. The women were regular in their attendance for examination; venereal disease has decreased amongst the women, and was of a mild type. The same remark applies to disease amongst the soldiers. Amongst the women 3 cases of syphilis and 23 cases of gonorrh( 120 ) the arrest of women practising unlicensed prostitution. The medical officer thinks these chaprasis are useless, and that the general police should render assistance in this matter as in England and France. Eleven unlicensed prostitutes were arrested during the year. Of these eight were registered and three were turned out of the station. Amongst the registered women 17 cases of syphilis, 3 cases of gonorrh( 121 ) be traced to her. A second woman, also a frequent sufferer from disease, was allowed to retire. Since these two women left, disease has decreased amongst the soldiers and amongst the registered women. Amongst the women 7 cases of syphilis and 6 cases of gonorrh( 122 ) accepted for a reason of non-attendance at any examination; so that by speedy dis- covery disease had neither time nor opportunity for development to a serious extent. Women were not detained in hospital during their periods of menstruation, but during this period a woman's ticket was not signed by the medical officer, as a warning to the soldier to have no communication with her, and the matron is held responsible for the continence of the women during that period. Amongst the women 12 cases of syphilis (all cases of unregistered women) and 36 cases of gonorrh( 123 ) The annual report shows conclusively that unregistered women are the chief causes of disease, and especially city women, the facts recorded as regards the artillery of Machibhawan showing conclusively that a city lock-hospital is a necessity. The artillery of the fort cannot be confined to its limits, and a soldier leaving the fort passes almost immediately into the city. With soldiers in cantonments it is different, and stringent measures have been used with particular regiments. Much trouble arises from the European and Eurasian women living on the borders of cantonments, and their principal locality of residence has been placed out of bounds to the European soldier. Of course these women, described as occupants of millinery establishments, refreshment-rooms, and board and lodging-houses, will remove in time to a locality not placed out of bounds, but they will be carefully watched and every endeavour made to prevent this cause of disease. The general thinks that when disease is trivial the soldier's monotonous life should not be made doubly irksome by restricting his liberty, but when disease prevails he will, and has placed the locality of disease prevalence out of bounds. The general explains that the words used by Dr. Fairland in his report of 1876, namely, that "very large numbers of soldiers from cantonments daily, or rather nightly, visit the city, was intended to convey the meaning, not that the soldiers were in the city during the night, but in the evening time only. The general is of opinion that it would serve no good purpose to increase the number of registered women, as, however numerous the registered women may be, the soldier will often prefer sexual intercourse furtively obtained with an unregistered woman to sexual intercourse openly obtained with a registered woman. 64 The deputy surgeon-general, I. M. D., notes that if the cases of vene- real disease which occurred during the past year in the 65th Regiment, removed from Lucknow in November had been entered in the returns, the ratio of deaths per 1,000 of the garrison would have been 159 instead of 153. The deputy surgeon-general thinks the establishment of lock-hospitals will not eradicate venereal disease because of the promiscuous sexual intercourse of the soldier. But the system when assiduously worked, as by Dr. Fairland at Lucknow, will undoubtedly con- trol the prevalence of such disease. He thinks the larger the number of registered women, the smaller the proportion of venereal disease amongst them and amongst the soldiers will be. The closing of the city lock-hospital he thinks an unwise measure so long as soldiers cohabit with city women. Of the two native infantry regiments at Lucknow, in one venereal disease prevailed, and was comparatively absent in the other. The cause of this peculiarity remains to be discovered. 65 The officiating deputy surgeon-general, A. M. D., concurs with Dr. Fairland in thinking that good results arise from the operation of the lock-hospital rules at Lucknow, and that harm has resulted from the closing of the city lock-hospital. He records the opinion that either the cantonment lock-hospital rules should be extended to the city, or the city lock-hospital be re-opened. 66 The city magistrate thinks that the lessened prevalence of venereal disease amongst the soldiers has been due to the placing of the city, or other places of disease prevalence, out of bounds. This measure was induced by the abolition of the city lock-hospital. He states that the Fort Machibhawan is to be evacuated by the artillery soldiers, and that the prevalence of venereal disease there may hasten the fulfilment of the Government promise in regard to this matter. The city lock-hospital was of no use to the people of the city, and the citizens could not be justly taxed to support it. If the military authorities had consented to allow its cost to be met from the cantonment share of the octroi, the city lock- hospital would have been maintained. A grant of Rs. 50 per mensem is made by the municipality to the cantonment lock-hospital with a view to the control of 32
( 124 ) of prostitutes who might plant themselves just outside cantonment limits; and for this purpose rules have been recently framed, providing that all ministerial work in regard to such prostitutes shall be done by the cantonment magistrate, all judicial work by the city magistrate. The rules have been submitted to Government for sanc- tion. The city magistrate states that it is illegal for the police to take an unregistered woman to the lock-hospital to examine or detain her there. 67 The deputy commissioner states that the rules referred to by the city magis- trate were submitted to Government on the 1st March, and that they referred to the subject of prostitutes, living within the city limits, who consorted with European soldiers. 68 The commissioner calls attention to the variance in the prevalence of disease in the different corps forming the garrison, being for the four bodies of troops con- cerned 55, 205, 115, and 191 per 1,000 respectively, and the commissioner is of opinion that the variance is due to the difference of regimental management. He thinks that whenever the rate of admission to hospital for venereal disease is abnor- mally high in any corps, its commanding and medical officers should be asked to account for the excess. The commissioner believes that the comparative diminution of disease during 1877 was due almost entirely to the measures of prevention enforced by the general commanding and to Dr. Fairland's exertions and exercise of practical experience in this matter, which has been of special value. The commissioner records the opinion that the prevalence of disease amongst the soldiers is an insufficient reason for the re-opening of the city lock-hospital. The proper remedy is to withdraw the artillery force from. Fort Machibhawan, where its position is generally admitted to be unsuitable. The commissioner concurs with the city magistrate in thinking that the city lock- hospital was of little use to the general population, and he does not think its abolition has sensibly affected disease in cantonments, for during the past year disease greatly decreased there. The rules for the enforcement of the Contagious Diseases Act in Lucknow city have not yet been submitted to Government for sanction, as they require consideration in connection with Home Department resolution No. 357, dated 21st December, 1877, upon which report and suggestions are in course of preparation. FYZABAD. 69 During the year 1877 a monthly average of 93 women remained on the register against 110 in 1876. The results of the management have been very satisfactory. During the five years 1873-77 the ratios of venereal cases amongst the European garrison at Fyzabad have been 476, 334, 526, 243, and 150 per 1,000 respectively. 70 The medical officer reports that the lock-hospital building is situated in Fyza- bad city, two miles distant from cantonments. During the past year the accommoda- tion has been improved by re-arrangement, to the comfort of the inmates. A screen, as in continental hospitals, has been suspended above the inspection table, by means of which the patient is saved from much unnecessary exposure. A residence for the native hospital assistant attached to the hospital is required. A suitable site for such residence exists at the hospital, and the attention of the canton- ment sub-committee has been called to this necessity. The favourable results of the year's management are attributable to( 125 ) permanent brickwork stand, erected to the height of a man's hips, has been erected in every room, and on this stand water in an earthenware basin and a piece of soap are placed, and a towel is hung on a nail near. By repeated visits to the rooms the medical officer has assured himself of the reality of these arrangements. 2nd.( 126 ) As marginal notes in the report the deputy commissioner concurs with the medi- cal officer in thinking that the medical inspections of the soldiers are debasing in their tendency; that the distribution of handbills and lecturing are more useful than such inspections or parades. He thinks that military discipline is rendered contemptible by the punishment of obliging a soldier to answer his name every hour at the guard- room. He states that the lock-hospital accommodation is contained in a nazul build- ing which has been improved for the purpose. The local agency cannot, however, be expected to provide a residence for the hospital assistant. This should be an imperial charge. SITAPUR. 74 During the year 1877 a monthly average of 108 women remained on the register against 97 in 1876. The results of the management have been in some measure satisfactory. The ratios of cases of venereal disease amongst the European garrison for the three years 1875-77 have been 274, 299, and 249 per 1,000 respectively. 75 The medical officer reports that the lock-hospital building at Sitapur is conveniently situated behind the European barracks and near to the sudder and regi- mental bazárs. The accommodation is ample, and the building properly screened by a high enclosure wall. A sub-committee of the standing station sanitary board, of which the deputy commissioner is a member, visits the lock-hospital once every month to consider and record the representations of the medical officer. Three police detectives were employed during the year to arrest village or vagrant women found at unseasonable hours in the jungle or under trees, or women suspected of irregular practices elsewhere. Barrack police Were also employed for the same purpose, and the police control has been efficient. Cases of improper arrest have occurred. All women arrested are examined, unless official intimation of exemption is received. Disease amongst the registered women has been mild in character, its cure speedy. Some cases of gonorrh( 127 ) authorities, as they unconsciously propagate disease, to which they are peculiarly liable by reason of promiscuous intercourse and want of cleanliness, and they have caused mischief of this kind in the garrison during the year. The medical officer thinks some soldiers like sexual intercourse with such idiotic women, and some certainly prefer sexual intercourse with unregistered women in secluded places to intercourse with the registered women in the established places. These unregistered women are generally found diseased when first examined. The only remedy against this fruitful cause of disease is the improvement and extension of the detective system; and especially the medical officer recommends that graduated fees should be paid to the detectives for arresting unlicensed prostitutes, and even to the dhaies or matrons and to the registered prostitutes a fee might with advantage be given for each unlicensed prostitute convicted by means of their evidence. The medical officer complains of the absence of records in the lock-hospital office, and suggests that printed reports and Government orders bearing on the subject of lock-hospital management should be filed in the lock-hospital offices. At Sitapur the absence of all records of what had gone before was so great that the medical officer did not know he had to prepare an annual report until told so by the deputy surgeon- general. 76. The cantonment committee record a decided decrease of disease during the past year. Syphilis has been very rare, and secondary syphilis apparently unknown. They endorse the recommendations of the medical officer as to the necessity of improving the detective system and providing an asylum for imbecile prostitutes, and trust the Government will take the necessary steps to procure such asylum. 77. The general commanding the division doubts the legality of subjecting an unregistered prostitute to medical examination. Concerning imbecile prostitutes, the general thinks they should be detained as long as possible at the lock-hospital, and caught again as soon as possible. The general thinks reports of hospitals should be generally circulated or distributed, and he records the opinion that the medical officer has paid much attention to his duties. 78. The deputy surgeon-general, Indian Medical Department, thinks the results of the year's management at Sitapur are not better than those of other lock-hospitals in the division. He thinks imbecile prostitutes should be dealt with by the canton- ment magistrate. Concerning the absence of records of past years' work, the deputy surgeon-general thinks all reports should be kept in an office-book as a permanent record for reference. 79. The deputy commissioner has no doubt that much disease amongst the soldiers at Sitapur is contracted from unregistered women outside cantonment limits. He explains that only unregistered women accused of having caused disease were ex- amined by the medical officer. The deputy commissioner thinks that imbecile pros- titutes are not fit subjects for admission to the lunatic asylum. Such women have been kept in the poorhouse, but refuse to remain there. He notes that a large pro- portion of the women admitted to the lock-hospital were not suffering from any vene- real disease. 80. The commissioner forwards the papers without remark. SUMMARY. 81. By reference to the table of results on 112th page of this report it will be observed that whilst for the year 1877 the results have been less satisfactory in regard to the lock-hospitals of the North-Western Provinces, they have been more satisfactory in regard to the lock-hospitals of Oudh : and the cause of this difference is that whereas in the North-Western Provinces the management has in some instances been characterized by negligence, in Oudh a greatly increased amount of carefulness and attention has characterized the management everywhere. 33
(128) This difference is the more deplorable in that for years previous to 1877 the results of the management in the North-Western Provinces had been greatly better than the results in Oudh. This better management in Oudh during 1877 has so far favourably affected the results for the combined provinces that I am still able to report a very considerable decrease of venereal disease amongst the troops of the garrison in 1877 as compared with the prevalence during the five years before the lock-hospitals were opened. 82. The comparative failure in good results during the past year cannot be set down to any serious failure in the discovery, treatment, and cure of the diseases from which the registered women suffered, for in a total of 1,817 registered women in 1876 a total of 3,219 cases of disease were cured, and in a total of 1,203 registered women in 1877 a total of 3,049 cases of disease were cured. The reports which I have previously summarised show incontestibly that the management of the registered women is admirably effected almost everywhere, and that they are not likely to be a cause of disease to any serious extent. 83. The stations of the North-Western Provinces in which the failure has been marked during the past year are Agra, Benares, Ránikhet, and Sháhjahánpur, and it will be necessary to call attention to the facts as regards these four garrisons of failure. At Agra, from the year 1874 to this last year of report, there had been a steadily decreasing ratio of disease prevalence amongst the soldiers, so much so that in 1876 the prevalence had fallen from 212 per 1,000 for the years before lock-hospitals were established to 92 per 1,000 for that year. Now in 1877 the ratio has risen to 248 per 1,000, showing worse results than obtained before the hospital was established. In para. 9 of this report it may be read that this untoward result was due to disease contracted by the soldiers from unlicensed women driven to prostitution in large numbers as a means of escaping starvation during a time of scarcity. These women were able to solicit the soldier publicly, to tempt them by accepting a small remuneration. In para. 10 it may be seen that the sub-committee was not active to prevent the prevalence of disease. At Benares for the past four years the results have shown a persistent prevalence of venereal disease, especially syphilis, there, which fairly entitles it to take rank as the most dangerous of all stations of the provinces in regard to this matter. For the five years before lock-hospitals existed the ratio of prevalence amongst the garrison was 373 per 1,000. For the past four years the mean ratio has been 417 per 1,000; for 1877 it was 479 per 1,000. At para. 25 it may be read that the medical officer does not think this a very excessive ratio when the proximity of the lines to the city and bazárs is taken into consideration. By which it may be understood that the soldiers are able to con- tract disease from unlicensed women therein. It may also be seen that, as a rule, the registered women were examined only twice in the month, and that some of those women were a cause of disease to the soldiers. At Ránikhet in 1877 the ratio of prevalence was 38.1 per 1,000. The mean ratio of the previous three years is 124 per 1,000. At para. 33 it may be read that the increase of disease was due to the sexual intercourse of soldiers with unlicensed women, fifteen of whom on arrest were found diseased. Many more would have been arrested but for a rule forbidding the arrest of a woman whilst inside a house, and but for the hard treatment the detective peons experienced at the hands of the soldiers. And it may be seen that part of one of the regiments of the garrison came from Benares, the station of great venereal prevalence. This may account for the violent outbreak of disease at Ránikhet in 1877. In 1876 the ratio of prevalence was only 52 per 1,000.
(129) At Sháhjahánpur the ratio of prevalence in. 1877 has been 305 per 1,000. For the two previous years the mean ratio is 243 per 1,000. Deducting cases of secondary syphilis, the ratio of 1877 falls to 227 per 1,000. But these cases cannot be deducted, when the ratio of prevalence is required for purposes of comparison, as they were included in the statements of previous years, and altogether it cannot be doubtful that venereal disease is unduly prevalent at Shájahánpur. The medical officer's report shows nothing as to the probable cause of this prevalence in 1877. In 1876 it was attributed to the existence of unlicensed prostitution. 84. I think the evidence favouring the opinion that the increase of disease in the previously mentioned four stations was due to unlicensed prostitution is too plainly stated to make its correctness for a moment doubtful. This cause of hindrance to successful lock-hospital management appears to have been more than usually prevalent in 1877 because of' the prevalent distress. In paras. 9, 10, and 13 this fact is very plainly stated, and there seems to be no doubt that during the past year distress has led many poor women to practise prosti- tution who in other years abstain from earning money in that way. And it further appears from a perusal of the reports generally that(130) 87. First.(131) 93. In 1876 the total expenditure for the maintenance of the lock-hospitals Was Rs. 33,834; in 1877 it his been Rs. 32,328. The saving is due entirely to the aboli- ion of the Lucknow city hospital. Of this total Rs. 32,328, Rs. 20,278 were paid from cantonment funds and Rs. 12,050 by Government. By reference to form No. II it may be seen that the hospitals at Cawnpore, Agra, Benares, Moradabad, Ránikhet, and Naini Tál were supported principally from Government funds. 94.

ORDERS OF GOVERNMENT. NO. 13 OF 1878. FROM THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, NORTH-WESTERN PROVINCES AND OUDH. To Te Srcy to the Govt of India, Home mule Department and the Quarter master genl. Army in India Dated Allahabad, the 5th August, 1878 SIR, I AM directed to forward for the information of His Excellency the Govr. Genl. in Council & H.E. the commander in cheif the annual report on the working of the lock hospitals in the North-Western Pro- vinces and Oudh, for the year 1877. The question of amending the existing law on the subject of contagious diseases is under separate con- sideration, with reference to the Resolution of the Government of India, Home Department (Sanitary), No. 357, dated 21a December last. 2. It will be observed that the Sanitary Commissioner has sum- marised the reports at page 112, and collected together the points on which orders are required (page 131). The summary is clear, and may be said to express generally the views of this Government. I am, how- ever, to add the following remarks :( 2 ) vigilance or comparative indifference of the regimental authorities. The marked improvement which the lock hospital returns show to have taken place in the garrisons of Oudh is chiefly due to the personal exertions of the General Commanding the Division. 3. The area within which registration was attempted was the same as in the previous year. In nearly all cases the rules are extended to an area of four or five miles around cantonments. At Chakráta these are limited to cantonments only, but it is proposed that they should be extended to a four-mile radius (page 61). This is a question that must be determined in the Military Department. The registration within cantonments seems in all stations, to be fairly strict, but beyond the cantonment boundaries it is often nominal. In no town do the authori- ties attempt to register any prostitutes except those visited by European soldiers. The utility of this imperfect registration principally depends on the vigilance of the town police. Where they are active, a fair mea- sure of success is attained. In Meerut, the cantonment committee have brought the defectiveness of the city registration to the notice of the Magistrate, and he has taken steps to remedy it (page 35). This might be also done by the cantonment committees of other towns, in which the registration of prostitutes outside cantonments is most defect- ive, and Magistrates will be directed by this Government to aid in securing a more efficient registration. 4. The report shows that comparatively little disease is contracted by the troops from registered prostitutes. Improvement in the existing state of things must be sought in the suppression of illicit prostitution, whether within or outside the protected area. This will be specially considered in the local Governments' reply to the resolution of the Government of India, in the Home Department, suggesting the amend- ment of the Cantonment Act, and of the rules framed under section XIX., clause 7 of it. Here it is enough to notice the importance of regimental measures of detection and inspection. The good results of keeping the troops out of the native town are seen in the instance of Cawnpore. Much of the illicit prostitution which goes on in canton- ments might be checked by regimental police, and by carefully keeping coolie and low-caste women from the vicinity of the lines. 5. The points enumerated by the Sanitary Commissioner in his para. 94, (page 131) are recommended to the special attention of the Government of India. They are questions which for the most part can only be disposed of by the Military Department. A few of them require notice.

IP/30/HC,4. IP FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE WORKING OF THE LOCK- HOSPITALS IN THE NORTH-WESTERN PROVINCES AND OUDH FOR THE YEAR 1878. THIS report will commence as usual with a summary of the results and remarks recorded in the annual papers submitted to Government by the local author- ities concerned with the management and improvement of the lock-hospital scheme. The hospitals here, and in the returns accompanying this report, are ranged in order of importance as regards the number of women controlled. (1)-CAWNPORE. 2. During the year 1878, a monthly average of 161 women remained on the register against 135 in 1877. The result of the management is unsatisfactory. 3. The ratios of admissions to hospital amongst the European garrison for the five years (1871 to 1878) have been 439.5, 266.0, 201.9, 212.3, and. 303.0 per 1,000 of strength respectively. 4. The Medical Officer reports that three changes of management have charac- terized the year. He thinks the comparative increase of venereal disease amongst the soldiers during the year may be accounted for by the number of unlicensed women who come from the city to visit the soldiers, and from famine-afflicted women who have practised prostitution as a means of livelihood. As the result of enquiry, he believes that there is an exceptional amount of venereal disease amongst the native population of Cawnpore city, and is of opinion that until the soldiers are forbidden to enter the city, or the city women to visit cantonments, the rate of venereal disease amongst the former cannot be lowered. The cases of syphilis seen during the year were not of a virulent character. 5. The Cantonment Committee consider the report satisfactory, notwithstanding the increase of disease recorded, this increase having been due in all probability to the fact that many women of the poorer classes were driven in time of unusual scarcity to eke out a livelihood by prostitution. All registered women reported absent from inspection have been punished when found. The committee recommend the establish- ment of a separate city lock-hospital, or that, at least, the cantonment funds should be relieved from the expense incurred in maintaining city women while in hospital. 6. The Magistrate notes that although disease has increased, its type has been mild. He thinks some portion of the increase may have been due to the influence of high prices upon women not usually addicted to prostitution ; but points out other probable causes, such as the happening of a local fair in February, when the admissions to hospital were most numerous : the complete change of garrison which occurred. in October, when the admissions were next highest in number, and when the whole- some rule placing the city out of bounds was lost sight of for a short time, The police arrested 65 unlicensed prostitutes during the year. 7. The Commissioner thinks the result of the management unsatisfactory, and concurs with the Magistrate in thinking that famine prevalence does not acconnt for all the increase of disease recorded. He thinks the complete change of garrison, and the changes of management which occurred during the year, must have contributed to the unfavourable result. The Commissioner thinks commanding officers of regiments on arrival at Cawnpore should be informed of the injurious results invariably attending the granting of passes to visit the city, and be warned to take special precautions on the occasion of large local fairs. The 65 women arrested by the police were found to be diseased. The Commis- sioner thinks they should have been registered if they solicited soldiers to prostitution. 1
( 2 ) The small increase of registered prostitutes recorded seems to show that this was not done. Also the Magistrate's attention is directed to the propriety of registering city women who consort with European soldiers. (2)( 3 ) line of march, and admitted 69 to hospital in February. In September the 85th Regiment had-50 admissions. In August and September, 23 badly diseased unregistered women were admitted to the lock-hospital. The medical officer thinks these diseased women caused the disease amongst the soldiers. Famine prevalence is, in the opinion of the medical officer, answerable in great degree for the increased number of patients requiring treatment amongst the women; Especially women brought by the police have been found diseased. They are described as young girls, or women with babes at the breast, not of the usual prostitute class, but women driven to prostitution through dread of actual starvation. 13. As incidents connected with the question of regimental control as efficient against intercourse of the soldier with unregistered women, the medical officer records that a soldier patient in hospital effected such intercourse in the ward, that a soldier effected such intercourse in the dining-hall of his barrack. A third woman, much diseased, was found in the lines, resident in a rum-barrel, and is believed to have been a source of much mischief. A fourth woman, suffering from primary syphilis, on being arrested by the police, stated that she had had intercourse with seven soldiers just before discovery. Work-women, employed on the new barracks, have been a cause of disease to the soldiers, and the number of these women was therefore reduced, and instructions issued for their surveillance. One European woman, practising pros- titution without license, was captured by the police and found to be diseased. 14. The medical officer-insists upon the necessity of registering all old or ugly women applying for license as well as good-looking women, as experience seems to show that some soldiers prefer intercourse furtively obtained, with a repulsive looking woman to intercourse with better-looking registered women resident in the chukla. He also urges the necessity of requiring the hearty co-operation of officers command- ing regiments in the efficient working of the lock-hospital system. These officers are possessed of great authority to aid the work, but it is necessary that this authority should be exercised at all times and under all changes of command. 15. The medical officer states that in Lucknow it is the custom to arrest women suspected of unlicensed prostitution and bring them to hospital for examination. Good results from this plan of action, and the medical officer asks that his hands may be strengthened by making it legal. 16. He dwells also upon the necessity of adding to the established returns a column for the entry of cases of local venereal ulcer, a different and less dangerous form of disease than primary syphilis, but now included in the returns with these latter cases. The medical officer is still of opinion that the lock-hospital at Lucknow should be a certified hospital under the Contagious. Diseases Act. He thinks either the cantonment lock-hospital rules, Act XIV. of 1868, should be in force in the city, but believes that the enforcement of the revised Cantonment Act would be prefer- able to either of the above. He thinks a week's simple imprisonment is useless as a deterrent punishment for a woman convicted of unlicensed prostitution, and would have the severity of the punishment increased. The medical officer highly approves of a recent general order directing that men discharged from hospital, cured of venereal disease, be debarred from drinking beer or spirits for 14 days. 17. The Deputy Surgeon-General, British Troops, has carefully perused the report. 18. The Deputy Surgeon-General, Indian Medical Department, thinks the entire absence of primary and secondary syphilis amongst the registered women is very satis-factory. 19. The Lieutenant-General Commanding Oudh Division records the perfect attention, during the year, of administrative, executive, and commanding officers to the very important duty of endeavouring to check venereal disease amongst the British troops, and attributes the unsatisfactory results to the preference the soldier
( 4 ) has for intercourse with unregistered women. The General accords much praise to Dr. Fairland and his native assistant for the exceeding care with which they have conducted their lock-hospital duties during the year. 20. The Cantonment Magistrate records the opinion that the women who disease the soldiers are European, half-caste and native prostitutes who live just outside cantonments. Last year he asked that rules framed in 1876 for the control of these women might be sanctioned, and he still urges their sanction. This officer is of opinion that the lock-hospital sub-committee have little real power ; they can, and do, point out many defects, but have no power to remove them. They have a want of power to enforce advice. For example, they cannot enforce the discontinuance of the employment of women by the Department Public Works on cantonment works, although these women are well known to be a fruitful cause of disease. The Canton- ment Magistrate states that the medical officer is mistaken in supposing that suspec- ted women are arrested by the police and sent to hospital for examination. Only women found guilty of illicit prostitution are sent for examination. These women, who are most repulsive in appearance, are treated as well as respectable people. The reason why soldiers prefer these women is because they are less expensive. These women do not care to be registered, because they cannot afford to live in the houses registered women inhabit. The Cantonment Magistrate thinks the punishment to which unregistered prostitutes are liable under the existing law should be increased, and quotes the case of a well-known woman who cares nothing for the amount of punishment that can now be inflicted. Also reference is made to the European woman mentioned by the medical officer. It is stated that she is now living across the cantonment border at her old trade. She has brought many soldiers to grief and supplies them with liquor. Many more women of the same stamp are living at Luck- now, and so long as they are not dealt with, better results cannot be expected from lock-hospital management. 21. The Lieutenant-General endorses the Cantonment Magistrate's record with a favourable opinion, and commends his remarks to the attention of the civil authorities and to the Government, hoping that orders may soon be passed remedying the evil complained of. 22. The Deputy Commissioner records the opinion that the local civil author- ities cannot effectually prevent the evil complained of until the rules mentioned by the Cantonment Magistrate have been sanctioned by Government. He also agrees with the Cantonment Magistrate in thinking that the sub-committee have no power. 23. The Commissioner thinks the management of the lock-hospital has been all that can be desired, and commends the medical officer for his zealous performance of duty. He believes with the medical officer that many unregistered women were driven to prostitution by famine, and as 103 out of 116 such women were found diseased, they must have been a cause of disease to the soldiers. The Commissioner urges particular attention for the prevention of disease on the line of march, and its discovery on arrival of a regiment at its destination, and especially on its arrival from England. He would encourage the use of the influence of commanding officers and medical officers for the prevention of venereal disease amongst the soldiers, and would bring to the notice of His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief certain paras. of the medical officer's report (54, 56, 57), in which it is shown that that influence is not always existent, With reference to the abolished city lock-hospital, the Commis- sioner points out that the Machi Bhawan quarter so much complained of never did come under the city lock-hospital operations. As yet final orders have not beer passed on the rules mentioned by the Cantonment Magistrate. (3)( 5 ) The results of the managements have been most unsatisfactory. For the five years 1874-78, the ratios of venereal cases per 1,000 of the European garrison at Agra, have been 181, 101, 91, 247, and 397 respectively. 25. The Medical Officer reports that the increase of disease has been general in all corps comprising the garrison. Soldiers in cantonments suffered mostly from gonorrh( 6 ) The Agra and Muttra reports were forwarded with one covering letter, in which the Commissioner records the opinion, applicable to both reports, that, as he has said many times before and proved, the effectual suppression of venereal disease will result from increased vigilance and care on the part of the regimental police, and not from extended. registration of women. Especially a considerable restriction of the men's right to wander at will through native cities and bazaars must be effected. (4)( 7 ) registered more women in 1878 than in 1877. Also that the 282 cases of reported absence from inspection are devisable. amongst 74 women only. Of these women 19 were punished, whilst in 1877, amongst a much larger number of women reported, only 6 were punished. Also in 1878 the muharrir in charge of lock-hospital cases, has been several times punished, for lax or suspicious action in regard to them. The Cantonment Magistrate acknowledges that the native police are useless for the detection of unlicensed prostitution by reason of their openness to bribery, or willingness to receive gratuitous favours from the women they ought to arrest. He would not counsel the arrest of suspected women by the police, by reason of the power they would acquire to practise a lucrative employment, by demanding money from innocent women on threat of unjust report. He acknowledges that the police have failed in their duty to bring up for punishment many women reported absent from inspection: Stringent orders have been passed on this subject, and the Superintendent of Police has been asked to aid in this direction. But the result has not been been favorable: out of 10 absent, perhaps one or two have been arrested. The Cantonment Magistrate thinks the good or bad results of a year's management depend upon luck-explaining that a good-looking ayah may be a cause of much disease before detection, or that the source of the disease may be in the very midst of the barracks. He thinks much mischief results from barrack-ayahs and canton- ment servants, who have better opportunities than vagrant women for meeting soldiers secretly. In view of the manifest failure of the police in this matter now, the Canton- ment Magistrate proposes the establishment of a scale of rewards to be paid to the policeman or chaukidár reporting or arresting a guilty woman. He would give Rs. 5 reward for the arrest of a woman diseased with syphilis; Rs. 3 if diseased with gonorrh( 8 ) 33. The Commissioner considers the results of the year's management most unsatisfactory. The lock-hospital management exhibits results more satisfactory than those of 1877 as regards the women. The undoubted cause of failure as regards the European soldiery was the entire change of garrison, resulting in relaxation of regi- mental rules as to the limits within which the soldiers are permitted to range. The Commissioner is strongly convinced that for the efficient working of the lock hospital system at Allahabad, the city and larger bazaars should be placed out of bounds to the soldier, and that the regimental police should be made more efficient. The Magistrate should endeavour to arrest the women reported to haunt the rest camp and vicinity of barracks, and remove such of them as will not consent to registration. (5)( 9 ) 38. The Commissioner summarises the report and returns, and records the opinion that large numbers of the poorest classes of women adopted prostitution dur- ing the late scarcity as a means of procuring food. (6)( 10 ) The composition of the cantonment lock-hospital sub-Committee is radically bad. A military officer of high rank should be chairman, and the members should be selected so as to represent the various branches of the English army in the station. Especially the Cantonment Magistrate should not be on the committee, his right place being to effect the wishes or orders of the committee, and not to deliberate. The medical officer should not be the Civil Surgeon, but a Military Surgeon directly under the Military authorities. The Magistrate should not belong to the sub-committee, and his co-ordinate jurisdiction in police matters in cantonments, in reference to lock-hospital management, should be wholly abolished in theory and practice, the whole control resting with the Officer Commanding the Station. 43. The Commissioner thinks the results unsatisfactory, the cause not being plainly made out in the reports received. The fact that good regimental police in the cavalry regiment seems to have prevented disease points to the fact that the prophylactic against venereal disease in the British soldier in India is avoidance of unregistered women. The Commissioner confirms the Magistrate and Collector's view, that soldiers do not visit city prostitutes, and states that there is no ground for the belief that city prostitutes come into cantonments to meet the soldier. The stray coolie women cause much of the disease seen, and the late bad times have extended the range of this source of contagion. (7)( 11 ) He thinks all prostitutes by profession ought to be registered, and even dancing- girls, who, from north to south of India, practise prostitution and are a cause of dis- ease. He would desire to protect the native population, as well as the European, from venereal disease, on the grounds that protection is granted against cholera and small- pox The medical officer commends a recent general order prohibiting access to the canteen for 14 days to soldiers discharged from hospital after cure from venereal dis- ease. This order will prevent relapse of gonorrh( 12 ) soldiers as compared with the two previous years is satisfactory. The committee concur in the medical officer's remarks regarding the Sanitary Commissioner's reflec- tions on the management in 1876. 51. The Magistrate records the opinion that but little good can be effected until a small monthly allowance is given to a registered woman. Now only the scum of the bazaars will volunteer for registration. At present registration is looked on as a stigma. In regard to lock-hospital management at Benares great allowance must be made for the peculiar condition of the cantonment immediately adjoining and over- lapped by the bazaars of the most populous city in the province. It is next to impossi- ble to prevent the access of soldiers to the city. A reduction in the number of registered women will increase the soldier's tempta- tion to, go into the city. The registration of a more attractive class of women would have a good effect, and the Magistrate refers to a somewhat similar suggestion he made in 1876. 52. The Commissioner notes that the average of disease amongst the British troops at Benares in 1878 has been about double the ordinary average as given in the Sanitary Commissioner's latest report. Yet the average of 1878 was only 33.3 per cent against 47.8 per cent. in 1877. (9)( 13 ) 56. The Commissioner notes that of the 37 newly-registered women of the year many were destitute young girls. He records the opinion that if, as recommen- ded by the medical officer, the lock-hospital was removed from the city to canton- ments, the supervision might be real instead of nominal as now. The increase of venereal disease, both among the troops and civil population, was due to the general scarcity, which induced many of the poorer classes of natives, amongst whom disease is fearfully prevalent, to prostitute themselves for a trifle. (10)( 14 ) impossible in Ránikhet, especially on account of the great number of low-caste women; employed within cantonment by the Department Public Works. The greater portion of these women have venereal disease. Although the ratio of disease is so high and the result unsatisfactory, yet every- thing has been done to render the working of the system efficient. New inspection rooms have been provided, so that the registered women may be examined near their quarters and at uncertain periods. The commanding officers of Her Majesty's 34th Regiment, and of the details, were members of the sub-committee. Increased accom- modation for the registered women was provided. Orders were issued that on arrival at Ránikhet every soldier should be medically inspected. Adequate means of ablution have been provided in each registered woman's house. 59. The Cantonment Committee record the opinion that a large amount of the dis- ease which has prevailed was contracted from unregistered women, principally women employed by the Department Public Works. At the same time it must be stated that a large amount of disease was imported into the station by the 34th Regiment. 60. The Commissioner is convinced that all the measures that have proved successful in preventing disease among the troops are in the hands of the committee. The civil authorities can do nothing to improve matters. Low-caste women must work in hill cantonments, and some soldiers will prefer clandestine to authorized prostitution. Much of the disease recorded results from the indolent aimless life of a soldier in the hills, and the facility with which they can obtain strong drink. This question is at the root of permanent improvement in the health of the men, but is too large for local authorities to deal with. (11)( 15 ) He thinks that, owing to the exceptional conditions of the year, disease would have been more rife and virulent than it has been but for the attention of the committee and authorities and the vigilance of the police. The Native Doctor is kind and attentive to the patients and has been efficient in his work. 63. The Magistrate summarises the report. 64. The Commissioner notes that the marked decrease of syphilis amongst the soldiers is satisfactory. In the three years, 1876-78, the cases of syphilis have number- ed 59, 40, and 19 respectively. (12)( 16 ) (13)( 17 ) 73. The Deputy Commissioner agrees with the Cantonment Committee that the situation and peculiarities of the cantonment site make it unusually difficult to effect good results from lock-hospital management and rules there. The high price of food drove many women to prostitution. The area of lock-hospital jurisdiction should be increased. At present it does not extend beyond cantonment boundaries. The Deputy Commissioner also agrees with the committee in thinking that unlicensed prostitution should be more severely punished, and that solicitation should be made punishable. 74. The Commissioner notes an increase of disease during 1878. The Deputy Commissioner will be asked to state how he proposes to enforce the rules in the additional area he wishes taken up. It is not necessary to discuss changes in the law in an annual report. (14)( 18 ) For the five years, 1874-78, the ratios of cases of venereal disease per 1,000 of the European garrison at Roorkee have been 198, 146, 124, 66, and 262 respectively. 80. The Medical Officer reports that the lock-hospital was at times during the year made uncomfortable for the registered women by the presence of filthy unregister- ed coolie and beggar women, detained there for treatment. Venereal disease has been very prevalent during the year amongst the soldiers of the infantry regiment. The Royal Engineers, a daily average of 48 men, were free from disease. It is necessary to mention that relapses have been entered as new cases in the hospital returns. The soldiers accused the registered women in some instances of being the cause of their diseases. The women accused were examined and placed under observation in hospital for eight days, but not one of them was found diseased. The cause of the disease preva- lence was probably unlicensed prostitution. Several of the soldiers confessed that their diseases were contracted from unregis- tered women, met in the open country around Roorkee, and this fact was brought to the notice of the commanding officer. Of 33 unregistered women arrested by the police 19 were found diseased and treated in the lock-hospital. The examinations were regularly effected ; amongst the registered women only 9 cases of venereal disease occurred. The women were quiet, orderly, and obedient. The soldiers did not enquire as to whether a registered woman was possessed of her ticket or not. As regards the registered women and their general condition of good health, the soldier at Roorkee may be considered as protected from venereal disease. But pros- titution amongst unregistered vagrant, coolie, beggar, wood and milk selling women exists to an enormous extent and is a prolific cause of disease. The native police cannot cope with this evil, having too little power, and the law deals with it very mildly. The medical officer is of opinion that the only way to check disease is by special precautions when the men quit cantonments, and great vigilance on the part of the military and civil police. 81. The Cantonment Magistrate reports that, despite the efforts of the authori- ties, the illicit prostitution which has been the cause of the increased prevalence of disease could be only partially suppressed. The scarcity of the year is primarily responsible for the increase of disease. A great number of pauper women have been driven to prostitution, and great liberty has been accorded to the soldiers. An attempt was made, during the year, to induce the registered women to live in the infantry bazaar. At present they live in Roorkee Town. But the attempt failed, as the registered women objected to move, pleading that the soldiers preferred cheaper unregistered women to them, and that there was too scanty a native population living in the Bazaar. An endeavour has been made to attract a better and younger class of women for registration, but without success. The Cantonment Magistrate thinks that to attract better women it would be necessary to give them houses rent-free and a retaining fee. 82. The Magistrate and Collector forwards the report without remark. 83. The Commissioner thinks the disease prevalent has been largely due to the scarcity, which has induced many unfortunate women to associate with the soldiers as a means of livelihood.
( 19 ) (16)MUTTRA. 84. During the year 1878 a monthly average of 15 women have remained on the register against 18 in 1877. The results of the management have been unsatisfactory. The ratios of venereal cases per 1,000 of the European garrison for the five years, 1874-78, have been 190, 127, 132, 96, and 223 respectively. It should be added that of a total of 71 cases admitted to hospital in 1878, 42 occurred on the line of march between Rawal Pindi and Muttra. 85. The Medical Officer reports that a large proportion of the cases of disease amongst the soldiers are due to women who walk about the lines selling rope, socks, or begging. These women are to be found, also, on the outskirts of cantonments. Six unregistered women arrested by the regimental police were all found to be seriously diseased. The registered women have been regularly examined and satisfactorily managed. Disease amongst them has been little, only 11 cases of venereal disease in the year. 86. The Magistrate forwards the report without comment. 87. The Commissioner is of opinion that for the effectual suppression of venereal disease we must look to increased vigilance on the part of the regimental police, and to a considerable restriction of the men's right of wandering at will through native cities and bazaars, and not to extended registration of women. 88. It may be observed that the preceding short notices provide information concerning 16 lock-hospitals only, although there are 17 lock-hospitals in the province. The seventeenth, of which notice is missing, is the hospital at Sitapur, and the cause of the omission is that up to date no lock-hospital reports of 1878 have been received in my office from Sitapur. The want of report may be due to the departure of the European garrison to the seat of war. The report has been asked for, and the facts in regard to Sitapur will be submitted to Government as soon as possible. 89. Omitting, then, all reference to Sitapur, the total figures of the returns pertaining to the sixteen hospitals previously noticed provide statements of results for the year pointing to a total failure as regards the purpose for which lock-hospitals were established( 20 ) 91. This table of results shows that during 1878 venereal disease was consider- ably more prevalent amongst the European soldiers than during the five years before the lock-hospitals were established. By reference to the short notices commencing this report, it may be seen that the results have not been very satisfactory in any station. Chakráta, Jhánsi, Naini Tal, and Fyzabad show the best results, but even therein nothing like progressive improvement appears. In all the remaining stations the prevalence of disease amongst the soldiers is shown to have been lamentably great. The facts are best seen by reference to table IV. which accompanies this report. 92. The expenditure for 16 hospitals in 1878 has been greater by Rs. 2,456 than the expenditure for 17 hospitals in 1877. The increase has occurred under the head, " all other expenses," occurring principally for purchase of diet and medicines for women in hospital. Diet especially has been more than usually expensive by reason of the high prices which ruled during the year. The facts may be seen by reference to table II. accompanying this report. 93. A monthly average greater by 40 women has remained on the register of 16 hospitals in 1878 as compared with the number for 1877 in 17 hospitals. Amongst these women serious venereal disease has been greater by 320 cases of syphilis in 16 hospitals in 1878 as compared with the cases in 17 hospitals in 1877 (vide table I. accompanying the report.) 94. This accumulative weight of evidence, proving the ill success of the year's working, greatly increased disease amongst the soldiers, increased expenditure, more disease amongst the women, arises probably in greatest measure from one and the same source for all causes( 21 ) prevent the mischief. Given year of distress, when pauper women are plentiful, and the result is a greater amount of disease than existed before the lock-hospitals were established. 96. Something of the unsatisfactory result in 1878 must certainly be put down to the condition of warfare which has characterized the year. This has necessitated much movement and marching of troops, and as usual much disease has been con- tracted on the march or at halting stations. As recorded at paras. 12, 30, 58½, 66, and 84, year after year the same fact of disease contracted on the march is recorded, and it seems to be established that very little, if anything, of prevention against dis- ease is in active existence then. 97. Amidst all this record of ill success, the one feature of comfort is the undoubted benefit of the existing lock-hospital system to the very considerable company of women who are controlled or otherwise benefited by it. There is much in the reports testifying to this fact. I do not think the Govern- ment intended that by the establishment of lock-hospitals the resulting benefits should fall principally upon the women, but there can be little doubt that that is the result which has been arrived at now. As a home, refuge, and place of cure, for diseased women, who otherwise would probably go uncured to a lingering death, these institu- tions are instrumental in conferring an amount of benefit on a most pitiable class of suffering humanity. This benefit extends far outside the circle of registered women, being indeed con- ferred on all women suffering from venereal disease brought for treatment. The fre- quency and serious nature of these cases of unregistered women may be seen by reference to paras. 10, 11, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 62, 71, 80, and 85. Indeed, from the frequency of the seriously diseased condition of unregistered women brought for examination, it would seem probable that they are chiefly subject to arrest only after they have become notorious as causing disease to the soldiers. 98. It seems likely that in establishing a lock-hospital system the Govern- ment had hopes that the soldier would restrict his attentions, in more than former measure, to the registered women certified to be healthy. It may even have been hoped that the soldier would have been guided by stricter management to avoid the companionship of unregistered women. If that was so, I think experience shows that the hope was futile, excepting per- haps in regard to here and there a regiment having a commanding officer more than ordinarily solicitous about the welfare of his men. I fear the British soldier cannot be managed in regard to this matter as I believe some continental soldiers are. Governed as the English army is, probably something of good tone pervades the force at large, making the open visitation of selected women absolutely repugnant to many of the men. I think it always has been, and always will be, an attribute of the English soldier to dress well and endeavour to look well in his walks abroad, from a natural desire to please or attract, prior to more familiar advances( 22 ) In para. 37 the soldier is said to meet women in the fields and groves. At para. 69 the hill women are described as having gradually overcome their former dislike to Europeans. At para. 71 it is recorded that unlicensed intercourse has been unlimited, and that no soldier will allow a woman in his company to be arrested by a native policeman. 99. But in addition to this prevalent spirit of desire for selection in regard to female companionships, the reports contain something of proof that some soldiers are at times disobedient, and reckless of consequences in regard to sexual intercourse, in an ex- traordinary degree. Thus, at para. 25, it is said that many soldiers did not know with whom they had cohabited, being under the influence of drink. At para. 13 it is re- corded that sexual intercourse was effected in the hospital ward and in the soldiers' dining-hall ; and that a woman, believed to have been a source of much mischief, was found in the lines, living in a rum-barrel. These, no doubt, are exceptional cir- cumstances, but they illustrate faithfully the extreme difficulties with which the man- agement has to contend, so long as the soldier will not help towards its success. It is mournful to think it possible that all the labor and care of the medical officer con- trolling 134 registered women, all the hearty interest, discussions, and schemes for improved management of the sub-committee, could be in any measure injured or over- thrown by the presence of a woman actually in the lines and hiding in a rum-barrel. 100. Referring to the reports, it will be found that almost all authorities agree in considering the year's working to have resulted in failure, and that the cause of failure has been the intercourse of the soldier with women who are not registered. The advice tendered for the remedy of this condition is of two kinds :( 23 ) A condition of disease generally accounted for in the reports by the fact that soldiers communicated disease to the registered women, or that they contracted disease from native men, whose visits they were obliged to receive as a means of livelihood when the soldiers neglected them. This is most plainly shown in paras. 25 and 81. And the circumstance adds great force to the opinion that the successful manage- ment of the lock-hospital system depends in greatest measure upon the action of commanding officers. The women of the system must live, and if the soldier is able to neglect them by reason of easy access to other women, native men step in to take his place( 24 ) SITAPUR. During the year 1878, a monthly average of 108 women remained on the register. Exactly the same number were registered in 1877. The results of the management have been very unsatisfactory. The ratios of venereal cases per 1,000 of the European garrison, for the four years, 1875-78, have been 274, 299, 249, and 332 respectively. 2. The Medical Officer reports that, amongst the registered women, of 304 cases admitted to hospital, 90 were cases of gonorrh( 25 ) The ratio per 1,000 of gonorrh( 26 ) Passes were granted to the men on Thursdays to visit the vicinity of Sitapur, but there is no reason to believe that they spent their time in the villages. The commanding officer asks that the medical officer may be called upon to substantiate the facts he has recorded regarding the men of the 92nd. The com- manding efficer is convinced that the greater part of the disease amongst the soldiers was contracted from registered women, for, in many instances, registered women pointed out by the soldiers as causing their disease were, on examination, found to be diseased. 9. The Deputy Commissioner reports that, in the beginning of the year, there was considerable distress in the district, and during that period numbers of destitute women prostituted themselves in Sitapur and the neighbouring villages. These women were a plentiful source of disease, and from them the increase of venereal disease amongst the troops was caused. Precautionary measures were taken by the military authorities, but the Deputy Commissioner is not aware that any restrictions were put upon soldiers as regards their walks into the country for sporting and other purposes. He has no doubt that on these occasions soldiers make a point of meeting unregistered women, and very frequently get diseased. He would not have the soldier's liberty generally curtailed in this respect, as the walks are healthful and the good would suffer with the bad ; but is of opinion that while hese excursions are permitted, it is impossible to control venereal disease. 10. The Commissioner forwards the papers without remark. 11. The delay in the submission of these papers to Government has been accounted for by the fact, that the medical officer's report was originally written without the authorized margin, and afterwards resubmitted, apparently in proper form, but very badly written and with many clerical errors( 27 ) The medical officer appears to have reported what he believed to be true, but in language too forcible for official correspondence when opinions not supportable by evidence are recorded. That soldiers do sometimes resist the arrest of women with whom they are in company is shown by many statements to be found in different por- tions of the series of reports on lock hospitals, which I have received during the past five years. At Sitapur itself, in 1877, it was reported by an experienced medical officer that the arrest of vagrant women, who prostitute themselves in groves near canton- ments, is often impossible, owing to the reluctance or inability of the men to assist the police. That soldiers do occasionally leave their barracks at night-time without permis- sion has been recorded also on a previous occasion. That they did so once or twice at Sitapur in 1878 seems likely, by the report of the commanding officer of the 92nd that check roll-calls were ordered at all hours of the night, and on one or two occasions men were found absent and afterwards discovered in the sudder bazaar. 13. The opinion, that the disease complained of was contracted principally from the registered women, is upheld chiefly by the Deputy Surgeon-General, Indian Medical Department, and the Officer Commanding Her Majesty's 92nd Regiment. The Deputy Surgeon-General founds his opinion upon the fact that the ratio of disease amongst the registered women was very high. This is very true. But it must be explained that many of .the admissions to lock hospitals are cases of women admitted to be cured of disease prior to registration, and this particularly in regard to cases of syphilis and very severe forms of disease generally. In all years, the ratio of' admissions to strength of registered women is extremely high. In 1877, at Fyzabad, where good results were obtained as regards the soldiers, the admissions from syphilis were 849.4 per 1,000 of strength amongst the women, and of gonorrh( 28 ) These words, I think, describe very well the true circumstances of the case. The system provides lock hospitals, medical officers and establishments, rof women and their maintenance in hospital when diseased, at a cost, for the past year, of Rs. 36,405-7-3. But the action of the soldiers defeats the object aimed at. Attracted to other women, they do not support the registered women, who for means of livelihood receive the visits of native men, to the danger of disease where safety is desired. To the cost abovementioned must be added a considerable sum for printing charges. And some account must be taken of the extraordinary amount of official correspondence which the system entails. Year after year, reports, returns, opinions, letters and statements accumulate, until the book printed under the heading " Working of the lock hospitals" reached, in 1877, to a volume of 135 foolscap pages. 16. Gathering the results of all this endeavour into one small table, the figures of which, excepting for the column of 1878, are taken from statement II., attached to the note on the lock hospital reports of 1877 of the Sanitary Commissioner with the Government of India, the unwelcome fact appears that, as regards venereal disease, the British troops of these provinces suffered therefrom in nearly equal ratio during the five years before lock hospitals were established, and during the five years last past.

No.243/51OF 1879. FROM THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, N.-W. PROVINCES AND OUDH, To. Dated Naini Tal, the 28th August, 1879. SIR, SANITATION DEPT. I AM directed to forward, for the information of the annual report on the working of the lock- hospitals in the North-Western Provinces and Oudh for the year 1878. 2. The table of results at page 19 (the first 87 paras. are devoted to resumés of the committees' reports) discloses a very unsatisfactory state of things. As compared with 1877, expenditure on these institutions in- creased by about 13 per cent., while the other results are as under :- 1877. 1878. Percentage of increase. Average of registered women 1,203 1,350 +12.5 Admission of troops to hospital 2,591 3,789 +46.3 Ratio of cases per 1,000 soldiers 197 295 +50 From beginning to end the verdict( 2 ) than among the professional class, the result was only what was to be expected. In short, the class which mainly benefited by the large expen- diture of 1878 was that of the registered prostitutes. To such of them as were diseased, the lock-hospitals were at once a home, a refuge, and a place of cure. 4. The Lieutenant-Governor and Chief Commissioner is of opinion that there are two powerful causes operating to neutralise the measures for the repression of venereal disease in these provinces, and that until these can be removed, no real improvement can be looked for. These are( 3 ) tered women in hospital could secure immunity from disease, immunity would unquestionably be secured. As regards expenditure, attention was lately drawn to the necessity of economy in management ; and although the expenditure this year (1878) increased considerably, the increase was due to causes beyond the power of the officers concerned to check, viz., dearness of provisions and a larger number of admissions. It is import- ant that this fact, viz., that it is not the management of the hospitals that is at all to blame for the miserable results of the year, be clearly recog- nised. His Honor's own opinion is, and it is supported by such facts as decrease of syphilis in Sháhjahánpur, and the mildness of the type of disease in Cawnpore and Moradabad, that if the soldier had access only to registered women, the results would be very satisfactory. 6. In his 102nd para. Surgeon-Major Planck summarises, under 12 heads, the chief points claiming attention in the 1878 report. Some of these are purely local, others involve questions of practice and principle. In regard to these I am to note briefly as under :( 4 ) in His Honor's opinion, be secured by excluding them, if a committee is to be kept up as at present. (9) This is for the committee to decide. (10) Certainly the lock-hospital ought, if possible, to be in can- tonments rather than in the city of Moradabad. This point is one for the committee to take action on, in communication with the Quarter, master-General. (11 and 12) These are purely local questions, to be dealt with by the committees under the orders of the Military Department. 7.

IP/30/HG. 4 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE WORKING OF THE LOCK HOSPITALS IN THE NORTH-WESTERN PROVINCES AND OUDH, For the year 1879. PRELIMINARY NOTE. THIS report commences with the usual summary of the results and remarks, recorded in the annual papers submitted to Government, by the local authorities con- cerned with the management and improvement of the Lock Hospital scheme, paras. 1 to 101. The hospitals here, and in the returns accompanying this report, being ranged in order of importance as regards the number of women controlled. Following the concise summaries of locally recorded results and opinions of the year, the report will continue with such remarks, recommendations, or expressions of opinion, as a full acquaintance with the subject and close study of its official records for a period of six years, seem to warrant. These remarks being specially directed towards elucidating the exact working of the system as it now exists, and pointing the way to better future results, paras. 102 to 115. And the report will conclude with a record of the points of the local records calling for the especial attention of Government, para. 116. (1).( 2 ) The medical officer strongly urges the establishment of a system of rewards for the arrest of unlicensed women. He also complains of the mischief effected by low caste Ayah women employed in the lines by married non-commissioned officers and men. There has been a considerable increase in 1879 of the number of registered women, and as a consequence an increase in the record of disease amongst them. An increase due chiefly to the discovery and treatment of many very serious cases of syphilis, the worst of which were found amongst the unlicensed women arrested by the police. The Hospital Assistant, Hira Lal, who has been attached to the Allahabad lock hospital for the last eleven years, is highly commended for his professional attainments, good temper, and tact in the management of the women. 4. The Cantonment Magistrate calls attention to the extraordinary difference in the results of the management of the first and last six months of the year. The arrests effected in March and April, under the system of rewards mentioned by the medical officer, can hardly have been the cause of the great improvement in results recorded in October; November and December. Under this system of rewards 52 women, of whom 43 were found badly diseased, were brought on to the register within eight weeks time. During the previous twelve months only one case of this kind had been reported by the police. These facts speak for themselves, and the Magistrate of the district admitted the previous lax action of the police, while deprecating the method of procedure estab- lished for its improvement. The Cantonment Magistrate believes the system in force for the detection of illicit prostitution and disease is a farse, and thinks by the expenditure of a few rupees he could certainly obtain the arrest of 100 women, of whom probably 75 would be found badly diseased. The improvement in the attendance of the women for examination during the last six months of the year has been due to the action of the Superintendent of Police in tracing out offenders in this respect, even to the effecting of their arrest in other stations. Far from being unduly lenient in punishing absence from inspection, the Cantonment Magistrate has always punished every woman arrested for that reason. The difficulty formerly was to arrest the woman. 5. The Magistrate of the district reports that the result of the year's management are very much more encouraging than those of 1878, and this result is due to the energetic action of the Cantonment Magistrate, aided by the more honest and thorough performance of their duties by the police. A permanent improvement in results cannot, however, be looked for until a large lock hospital is provided in the city; until all prostitutes are registered; until the native female servants and workwomen of the barracks are brought under control, and until the city is placed out of bounds to the soldier. The Magistrate is of opinion that the distribution of rewards for the detection of women consorting with soldiers leads to gross abuses, out of all proportion to the benefits resulting. 6. The Commissioner notes the improved results of the management in the latter portion of the year. This improvement could hardly have resulted from the action of the Cantonment Magistrate in the earlier months of the year. The Commissioner commends the energy of the Cantonment Magistrate, but agrees with the Magistrate of the district in thinking that the disadvantages of the reward system outweigh its advantages.
( 3 ) 7. The Major-General of the Division records the opinion that the annual report for 1879 is very satisfactory, as showing a great diminution of disease, in comparison with 1878. The action of the Cantonment Magistrate, in offering special rewards, resulted in the detection of a large number of diseased women, and thereby to a diminution of disease amongst the soldiers. The Major-General commends the energy and zeal of the Cantonment Magistrate, and the satisfactory performance of his lock hospital duties by the medical officer. Also he notes the favourable report of the latter on the conduct of the Hospital As- sistant, Hira Lal. 8. To the file is appended a long letter from the Cantonment Magistrate under date the 17th May, 1879, in which he points out to the Magistrate of the district the success which attended the working of a temporary system of rewards. The reward being only one rupee for each woman arrested and found diseased. And the Cantonment Magistrate defends his action in this matter, shows the in- variable justness of his proceedings, and the justice meted out in his court. But at the same time acknowledges that the indirect effects of the system cannot be stated. (2).( 4 ) disease amongst the troops was greater in 1879 than in 1878, yet the gradual decrease of disease, as the year advanced, is very satisfactory. 13. The Magistrate thinks the working of the hospital has been most satisfac- tory as shown by the decrease of disease, as the year advanced. Punishments under the Act have been few, 12 by fine and 17 by short terms of imprisonment. As re- gards the reported prevalence of very virulent disease amongst city prostitutes, and its, probable cause, the Magistrate asks attention to the opinion of Ghulam Haidar, Inspector of the City Police, to the effect that the registered women of the city are not visited or supported by European soldiers, and are objectionable to higher class natives, because European soldiers may visit these ticketed women. As a result of this neglect the registered city women are visited and supported only by natives of the very lowest order, and suffer in consequence from the worst forms of disease. 14. The Commissioner very correctly points out that the results of the year's working cannot be considered satisfactory, as the ratio of disease amongst the soldiers was higher in 1879 than in any of the previous four years. He thinks, however, that the military and medical authorities may be be congratulated on the encouraging results of the working as the year advanced. This encouraging result was doubtless due to the greater restrictions placed on the soldiers liberty by Commanding Officers, as the year advanced. The Commissioner suggests that figures in this report, recording results of the working of the year immediately preceding that under review, should be printed in red ink to facilitate comparison. The Commissioner regrets the increase of disease recorded amongst the regis- tered women. He thinks, the medical officers statement, that few unregistered women remain about the station now, is satisfactory, and quotes the Kotwal's opinion to the effect that very few European soldiers visit the city women. It, therefore, seems likely that if the present strict rules as to the liberty of the soldier be maintained, the im- provement in regard to disease prevalence during the latter portion of 1879 may be continued in 1880. (3).( 5 ) 60th Rifles or of the Artillery. Although a daily average of seven military police were employed in the former, and one permanent and seven periodically employed police in the latter. Soldiers have given no information leading to the apprehension of the women from whom they contracted disease. No registered woman has been willing to give information as to the source of her disease, and this, it is believed, through fear of the results of informing against Europeans who support these women. The unregistered women on the contrary, when found diseased, readily gave the information required, and there is no doubt that 20 cases of syphilis, which occurred amongst the soldiers in April, were due to intercourse with a gang of such women. The registered women have been regular in their attendance for examination. In the cantonment the women were examined once a Week, in the city once a fortnight. Disease, as a whole, amongst the women diminished, from 303 cases in 1878 to 262 in 1879. But the cases of syphilis were 115 in 1879 against 94 in 1878. The cause of all this disease is obscure, but it is likely that the disease may have been conveyed to the women by natives as well as Europeans. The medical officer thinks that although the results of lock hospital working has lately been unsatisfac- tory and disheartening, yet the scheme could not be abandoned without the certainty of enormous increase and severity of disease amongst the soldiers. The cause of recent failure, as regards good results, has been the shameless con- duct of crowds of destitute women, so poor as to court sexual intercourse with a sol- dier for a reward of two and four pice. The medical officer thinks it difficult to devise a check for prostitution so cheaply sold, but is of opinion that the occupiers of land where a diseased woman is found ought to be punished, as they would be for harbour- ing a dangerous animal there. The regimental police or soldiers give no help towards the detection and arrest of these women. And the native police alone are unable to effect it, or are willing to forego the arrest when effected for two annas. To counteract this custom rewards might be offered for the arrests. Further experience has shown conclusively that nearly all the venereal disease contracted from unlicensed women by soldiers is contracted when the soldier is drunk, and, therefore, the medical officer favours the punishment of the diseased soldier by stoppage of his pay while sick, and the subsequent making up of duties escaped during the time of sickness. The papers contain no record of opinion or remark by the Cantonment Committee. 18. The Magistrate thinks all that can be said is that the record is an improve- ment on that of last year. The Artillery appear to have been most troubled by disease. The diminution of disease as the year advanced, and the prospects of the agricultural classes improved, would seem to support the view that the impoverishment of the people may have helped to swell the venereal returns. The regimental police have been useless for the purpose of arresting unlicensed women. The arrest of such women as a fixed duty of the ordinary police cannot be recommended as tending to demoralize the force. Occasional action of the police is advisable, and would be more effective if rewards for arrests were authorised. The medical officers complain that women infest the vicinity of the soldiers lines points to a faulty regimental police. The Magistrate supposes that under the short service system these police are young soldiers, whereas the duties of regimental police are best performed by soldiers of mature age. Indeed the general youth of the soldier now, and the comparative fewness of married soldiers, probably accounts for much of the prevalent venereal disease. With reference to the medical officer's re- mark that the sub-committee assembled whenever specially required to do so, the Magistrate remarks that at one time of the year the meetings were regularly held. That their regularity depends on the action of the Cantonment Magistrate. It may seem ridiculous to call meetings without special object, still the Magistrate thinks that when the meetings are irregular, the supervision of the work becomes slack. 2
( 6 ) 19. The Commissioner states that the reports show that little or no improve- ment has taken place since last year. The offer of a small reward for the arrest of an unregistered woman might be effective, but it might be considerably abused. The punishment of the occupiers of lands on which a diseased woman is found is impracticable. The irregularity cf the lock hospital committee meetings deserves notice. The Commissioner again records the opinion that success in lock hospital manage- ment depends to a great extent on the action of Commanding Officers. The laws and rules of the system, to be effectual, must be strongly supported by means controlling the movements of the soldiers when off duty, and their freedom to meet unlicensed women reduced to a minimum. (4).( 7 ) It is evident that the soldiers contracted little, disease from the registered women, for amongst the soldiers gonorrh( 8 ) 27. The results of the management have been very satisfactory. For the six years, 1874-79, the ratios of admissions to hospital for venereal disease amongst the Europeon garrison have been 298, 389, 321, 206, 292, and 171 per 1,000 of strength respectively. 28. The Medical Officer reports that new beds have been supplied to the hospital. In all other respects matters have remained as in previous years. The sub-committee assembled monthly, considered the state and extent of venereal prevalence amongst the soldiers, and adopted means for the prevention of any apparent source of disease. The authorities have exercised unceasing vigilance in the same direction with much resulting benefit. Some of the cantonment roads, and at times the city itself, have been placed out of bounds to the soldier. All drafts have been medically inspected on arrival. Diseased soldiers have been asked to identify the women who caused their disease. The registered women have been strictly overlooked. A special military police, composed under orders from army headquarters, of soldiers recently cured of venereal disease was organized, and particularly cautioned to be watchful against unlicensed prostitutes in or near the barracks. Soldiers recently cured also suffered restriction of liberty to within the area near to the barracks. All known prostitutes of cantonments were registered. Women suspected of prostitution and found lurking in retired places of cantonments were sent before the Cantonment Magistrate, and under his orders received into the hospital for examina- tion. Almost invariably women so received were found diseased. Of 52 women newly registered during the year, only six were found healthy on first examination. The registered women have been regular in attendance at the bi-weekly examinations which were most thoroughly effected, to the total number of 12,480 examinations in the year. Amongst these registered women 433 admissions to hospital occurred. In addition to the above 46 unregistered women were admitted to hospital, 20 of whom were suffering from primary syphilis of markedly severe form, as compared with the mild form of that disease seen amongst registered women. This comparative severity of syphilis in unregistered women may account for the continuance of severe types of the disease amongst the soldiers, The remaining 26 unregistered women were admitted for gonorrh( 9 ) In accordance with the usual rule, the men of the Fort Battery, quartered in or near the city, have suffered a greatest ratio from disease, probably contracted from city women who are not registered, now that the City Lock Hospital has been abol- ished. All the city women who presented themselves for registration in canton- ments were found seriously diseased. The men of the Artillery and 2-14th Infantry suffered in next highest proportion. They occupied barracks near to the race-course and neighbouring cultivated land, favourite hunting gounds of unlicensed women, and places very difficult of police control. The Cavalry, Horse Artillery, and 75th Regiment, greatly reduced their percent- age of disease, a very creditable result, due to the vigilance of Commanding Officers. As the result of experience, it appears that the worst cases of disease occur in soldiers who have contracted disease from unregistered women which is in ac- cordance with expectation, as the worst cases of disease treated in the lock hospital occur in unregistered women. The real cause of success in lock hospital management is incessant, vigilant, ubiquitious, police supervision over every class of women who can come in contact with the soldier. To secure this supervision money must be spent, and it will be bet- ter to spend it on measures of repression than for the treatment and support of the soldiers in hospital. All authorities now agree in the opinion that unlicensed prostitution is the cause of prevalent disease; and all forces should unite in suppressing this cause. And chiefly regimental and general police should work together for the prevention of illicit prostitution. A difficult, but not impossible, matter, even in the Lucknow Cantonment, with its numerous ravines, by-paths, and groves of trees. The Medical Officer again urges the necessity of separating cases of local ve- nereal, ulcer, from cases of primary syphilis in the returns. The first is the more common form of disease, and its return as primary syphi- lis is a great mistake, misleading the authorities as to the nature of the diseases pre- valent, for local venereal ulcer is a much less serious complaint than primary syphilis. 29. The Cantonment Magistrate reports that only women charged on good grounds with unlicensed prostitution with soldiers were sent for medical examination. He is of opinion that most of the disease affecting the soldiers results from their intercourse with unlicensed women. The registration is very incomplete, and will so remain until rules sent up for sanction in 1877 are sanctioned by the Government of India. The women, against whom these rules would operate, cause disease to the soldiers and supply them with liquor. The good effected at Lucknow, as against venereal prevalence, has been due chiefly to the energy of the medical officer, who has had charge of the hospital for many years. The Cantonment Magistrate deprecates the idea of abolishing lock hospitals, because figures may show that venereal disease has been in no way diminished amongst the soldiers since the hospitals were established. He thinks that before all are abolished the three that have shown the best results should be closed for three or four years. He is certain that the resulting increase and severity of the disease recorded in the three selected stations, during those years, would prove the disadvantage of abolishing the lock hospitals. 30. The Deputy Surgeon-General, Indian Medical Department, thinks that pro- miscuous intercourse of the sexes will assuredly cause venereal disease, and that the medical officer is too sanguine as to the efficacy of lock hospital management to check such disease. 3
( 10 ) He notes that the ratio per 1,000 of cases of disease amongst the registered women was 596.6 as against only 156.1 amongst the soldiers. These figures serve to show that more than half the registered women were during the year in a condition fitting them to impart disease. Yet the ratio of disease amongst the soldiers had considerably decreased, notwithstanding the illicit prostitution com- plained of. 31. The General Commanding the Division thinks that the lock hosptal has been of great advantage to the troops, but until the unlicensed women who now cause disease to the soldiers are registered, it is hopeless to expect very good results from the management. 32. The Deputy Commissioner of the district forwards the report without remark. 33. The Commissioner notes that there was much decrease of disease amongst the troops last year. He thinks that the lock hospital has been well managed for several years past( 11 ) The Medical Officer thinks that the venereal picket has been useless, excepting as a means of punishment for soldiers cured of venereal disease who have to serve on this picket. Punishment by having to make up arrears of duty may also have had a deterrent effect. The cantonment registered women have been examined every second day. The medical officer suggests that the soldiers should be required to confine him- self to the registered women, and he thinks the registered women should not be visited by native men. 37. The papers contain no remark by the Cantonment Committee. 38. The Magistrate is of opinion that venereal disease at Bareilly has been con- tracted by the soldiers mainly from unregistered women, who are unusually numerous, as a result of the famine of 1877-78. Having taken to prostitution, these women have continued to practise it. And probably more of these women are diseased now than in 1878. The native population, as well as the soldiers, has suffered from this cause of disease. As regards the soldiers, effective measures of prevention can be taken only by Commanding Officers, who should limit the liberty of the soldier, and severely punish men who falsely accuse a registered woman of being a cause of disease. The restriction of the soldiers liberty might result in making unregistered women unpopular. Now they are popular with the soldier( 12 ) tion for a time in hospital, these women have been found free from disease ; and the dates of admission to hospital of men and registered women have not tallied par- ticularly as regards cases of syphilis. Formerly it was the practice to detain the registered women in hospital during their period of menstruation. This practice was discontinued during the year, under the express orders of the General of the Division. The Medical Officer regrets the discontinuance of the practice in question, because it conduced to the more certain detection of disease, if existing, in any woman, and because a menstruating woman sometimes communicates gonorrh( 13 ) the registered women. Amongst unlicensed prostitutes brought by the police for examination severe cases were seen. During the year 125 cases of absence from examination were reported against 53 in 1878; and 198 women have been found diseased against 136 in 1878. The greater proportion of the women added to the register during the year were unlicensed prostitutes captured by the police, and almost all these women were found diseased. A considerable ncrease of disease amongst the soldiers occurred in 1879 ; general- ly the cases in the men were of a mild type, and few were followed by secondary symp- toms. During the month of April the Medical Officer called attention to the fact that primary syphilis prevailed amongst the soldiers, while there was no disease of this form amongst the registered women. As a result a number of unlicensed prostitutes were registered after arrest by the police, and the soldiers were forbidden to enter the city. At first good results followed these measures, but afterwards a high admis- sion ratio was again established. The Medical Officer has no doubt that most of the disease seen amongst the soldiers is contracted from unlicensed women of the population surrounding cantonments. He thinks the authorities, Civil and Military, have done all in their power to improve matters, but have failed in this object because it is probably impossible by police regu- lation to prevent this unlicensed prostitution in the Benares cantonment. He there- fore recommends the trial of a new plan by which selected women should be subsidized to act as courtezans to the soldiers only. The soldiers to be warned against inter- course with other women, and punished by stoppage of pay or otherwise when found diseased. As things are now managed at Benares, the lock hospital, he thinks, is a charita- ble institution, existing for the benefit of the registered women only, and not in any measure efficient as against the spread of disease amongst the soldiers. The Medical Officer recommends that, before further condemnatory remarks on the action of the local authorities are recorded, the Sanitary Commissioner should visit Benares to judge of the management, and, if necessary, make suggestions for its improvement. 48. The Cantonment Committee agree with the Medical Officer that blame for the very bad results recorded attaches to the system, and not to the civil or military authorities. The police did their duty well, as shown by the fact that 47 new women were added to the register. But the soldiers will not resort to registered women. The peculiar circumstances of the Benares cantonment, which is surrounded by crowded bazaars, makes the detection of illicit prostitution extremely difficult, and the committee favour a trial of the plan recommended by the Medical Officer of subsidiz- ing a few good looking women for the soldiers use only. 49. The Magistrate of the district thinks if the Sanitary Commissioner be requested to spend a short time at Benares, he might suggest some practicable remedy for the acknowledged failure in good results recorded there, and recommends the month of May as a good time for such visit. The Magistrate thinks that soldiers con- tracting venereal disease in India might be punished by stoppage of pay, as they are in England. 50. The Commissioner notes that nearly every second European soldier at Benares has suffered from venereal disease during the year 1879, notwithstanding all the efforts of the civil and military authorities to prevent the disease. The Commissioner agrees with the Medical Officer in thinking that a better class of women should be subsidized for the soldiers use ; soldiers visiting other women to be punished. 4
( 14 ) The compulsory registration of unlicensed women, arrested for prostitution with European soldiers, and their admission to the benefits of the lock hospital, is a mistake. These women should be punished by imprisonment. At present they intercept gains than should come to the registered women, and share the benefits of medical treatment which rightly belong only to the registered women. (9).( 15 ) (10).(16 ) Afterwards four of these women were detected in the act of prostitution with soldiers, near to the Regimental bazaar, in close proximity to the registered women's brothel. These women, on examination, were found in a most filthy and diseased state. Soldiers, being well fed, idle, and sometimes given to liquor, cannot, during their aimless wanderings from barracks, resist the temptation offered by these women ; and many soldiers, disliking the idea of being seen to visit the brothel, seek female intercourse in the ravines and woods which abound at Ranikhet. The Medical Officer looks upon the custom of asking the soldier to point out the woman from whom he contracted disease, as a farce, and no dependence can be placed on the soldier's word in this respect. Indeed, the soldiers seem to have leagued amongst themselves to thwart every effort made for their good in respect to this matter. At Ranikhet the established custom is for the registered women to leave the sta- tion when the troops go down to the plains. In the sudder bazaar about 80 prostitutes reside who are unregistered, on the grounds that they do not consort with soldiers. Yet it seems probable that they did receive soldiers visits, for on the departure of the troops these women also left the station. The attendance of the registered women for examination has been very regular. They have been examined weekly. The Medical Officer states that in the first seven months of the year it had been the custom to record all cases of leucorrh( 17 ) After these arrests were made, the Executive Engineer dismissed from employ- ment all women engaged on his work at Chaubatiya. 65. The Senior Assistant Commissioner concurs in the opinion that successful lock hospital management, in a station like Ranikhet, depends in greatest measure upon action, taken by the Regimental authorities, to keep their men away from temptation. He supposes that the caste women who will not cohabit with Europeans are " Paturs," a class of women who restrict themselves to cohabitation with high caste Hindus. But 80 Paturs could hardly find a living at Raníkhet. And the Senior Assist- ant Commissioner thinks some of these women may be Mussalmans, against whom the soldier requires protection. 66. The Commissioner thinks this report fully bears out his often expressed opinion that successful lock hospital management depends almost entirely on Regi- mental authority. Another powerful aid to failure is the aimless, self-indulgent, life of the soldier, which Government alone can remedy. (12).( 18 ) Roorkee cases was only 50.0 per 1,000 of strength. Stringent regulations for the discovery of disease amongst the soldiers were in force during the year. Soldiers in the habit of contracting venereal disease had to perform the duties of Military Police, and with good result. The Civil Police aided well, bringing all suspected women for examination. Of women so brought up seven were found seri- ously diseased. The attendance of the women for examination was very regular. Each woman was provided with a history ticket. Very little disease occurred amongst the women ; indeed, the cases recorded are those of women found diseased before registration. The soldiers were less able in 1879 to meet coolie and beggar women by reason of the interest taken in the matter by the Commanding Officer, Cantonment Magis- trate, and the Senior Medical Officer ; and the action of the Civil Police in keeping all vagrant women out of cantonments was an efficient help. The Medical Officer insists on the necessity of a joint general interest in the success of the management by the Commanding Officer, Cantonment Magistrate, and the Medical Officer, otherwise the essential Civil and Military Police regulations will never be carried out, and he complains of the entry, in the returns of relapses, as new cases. 76. The Cantonment Committee forward the report, with an expression of opinion that the lock hospital establishment is on the lowest possible scale consistent with efficiency. 77. The Magistrate of the district forwards the report without remark. 78. The Commissioner notes the favourable results recorded. He calls attention to the Medical Officer's just desire that a relapse of disease, that is a renewed outbreak, and consequent readmission to hospital, of an old case, in a soldier should not be entered in the returns as a new case. (14).( 19 ) 82. The Cantonment Magistrate reports that the working of the lock hospital rules during 1879 has been very successful in preventing venereal disease amongst the soldiers. And specially unregistered prostitution has been prevented. The extension of the limits of the area under lock hospital management, sanctioned during the year, has proved of great value. Formerly the law could not touch women offending just outside the cantonment pillars. The Cantonment Magistrate thinks the restriction might be applied to any place neighbouring cantonments without mention of precise limits of area. Women were punished for illicit prostitution during the year by fine or imprison- ment, but the punishment for this offence should be increased, as eight days impri- sonment, the existing maximum, is not sufficiently deterrent to a hardened offender. The great majority of these women were apprehended by the regimental police, who showed great activity in putting a stop to unlicensed prostitution, and have almost succeeded in putting it down. The Cantonment Magistrate thinks that the registered women would be better placed in twos or threes residing together in different secluded parts of the bazaar, than all together in a brothel or "chukla," as now, because then the soldier would escape the publicity attached to a brothel visit( 20 ) 88. The Medical Officer reports that there has been no change of management during the year. The hospital accommodation was ample. But the assistant's quarters are insufficient and unsuitable, and should be enlarged. Three different assistants have been attached to the hospital during the year. The convalescents arrived on the 11th April, a total 271 men, amongst whom 10 cases of syphilis and five cases of gonorrh( 21 ) The supervision of the Dháis has been satisfactory. 94. The Magistrate of the district reports that the medical charge of the lock hospital is held by an Apothecary, by order of the local Government. Occasionally the Surgeon of the Depot visits the lock hospital. There is no cantonment committee at Muttra. Its functions are exercised by the Officer Commanding the station. As there is no committee, it follows that there is no sub-committee for lock hospital management. It does not appear that the Commanding Officer´s exercise of such func- tions has been authorized by Government; more probably the functions of a canton- ment committee have been allowed to fall gradually into abeyance. 95. The Commissioner called for a statement of the management as above reported. He thinks the management is left almost entirely to the Apothecary in charge, and suggests the issue of orders in the Military and Medical Departments for the proper management of this lock hospital. (17).( 22 ) 257, 223, 231, 286, 254, and 257 per 1,000 of strength respectively. It appears then that the general results have not been quite so good in this as in the preceding year; and, indeed, they have been little better than the results obtained before lock hospitals where established. Then the annual mean ratio of admissions to hospital for venereal disease was 275 per 1,000 of strength, and as above stated the ratio in 1879 was 257 per 1,000. The figures witness to a measure of improvement hardly commensurate with the labour, attention, and expenditure devoted to the prevention of these diseases since the lock hospitals were established. 104. In considering this subject it becomes necessary to dwell forcibly upon the fact that this general unsatisfactory result is not caused by an even continuance of disease prevalence in all the stations influenced. Its cause on the contrary is chiefly due to a prevalence of disease at certain stations, considerably in excess of the pre- valence before lock hospitals were opened, this excessive prevalence almost coun- terbalancing the advantageous result recorded in the stations of decreased prevalence. 105. The stations of decreased prevalence in 1879, as compared with the record of the years before lock hospitals were established, appear in the following list :( 23 ) At Jhánsi it is recorded that a system of regimental police was enforced during the year, to the almost total extinction of unlicensed prostitution (para. 81). 106. The stations of increased prevalence, as compared with the record of the years before lock hospitals were established, are :(24) At Chakráta the cause was the considerable amount of disease contracted by the soldiers on the march to Chakráta. 107. It is worthy of especial remark that in this year's series of reports wherever good results have been obtained, they have been attributed to the active measures enforced by the regimental and cantonment authorities for the suppression of illicit intercourse. And wherever the result has been unfavourable, the cause has been attributed to an absence or failure of such measures. At Chakráta there is this difference that the excess of disease was contracted from unregistered women on the line of march Everywhere else the complaint is of disease contracted from unlicensed women of the station. And in further proof of the correctness of this unanimous opinion, it may be well to notice that where the results have been extraordinarily unfavourable, as at Benares or Naini Tal, there the local authorities record the belief that the suppression of this common cause of ill success is impossible. (paras. 47 and 88, 89). 108. In no former series of reports has this circumstance, as a cause of success or failure, been so unanimously insisted on. As years have passed, ever increasing attention has been given in the reports to it, as a cause of ill success. Now it begins to appears that both success and failure depend upon the effectual or defective suppres- sion of the soldiers intercourse with unlicensed women. Thus the question seems drawn to one point of extreme interest, towards which all efforts, in the hopes of bringing about improved results, should be concentrated. Without doubt it is true that common sense would have dictated from the very first that for the success of the endeavour the soldiers should be restricted to inter- course with the women of the system who are examined and certified to be healthy. During the past year there were a monthly average of 1,286 women on the registers, of whom a monthly average of 278 were detained in hospital as unfit for sexual inter- course. The balance 1,008 women provided almost exactly a ten per cent. average of women to soldiers, who numbered 10,262 in 1879. Experience seems to prove that, with carefully examined women, that average of healthy persons will suffice for the requirements of the scheme in this direction. But I would ask how is it possible that the scheme should provide successful results if the soldier of his free will is able to add an indefinite number of women, may be a thousand or more, quite unexamined, to the list of those from whom disease may be contracted. What seems to happen with regard to these unnumbered persons is, that the soldiers act, to their own detriment, as discoverers of disease in these women, who are then brought to hospital for cure and subsequent registration. 109. It cannot be possible, or is it necessary, to deny that occasionally disease may be contracted from a registered woman. But the infrequency and mild type of such disease bear no sort of comparison to the frequent and severe forms of disease contracted from the numerous unregistered women whom the soldiers, with great injustice, import into the scheme. It is probably quite true, as recorded by the Deputy Surgeon-General- (para. 30), that promiscuous sexual intercouse will result in venereal disease sooner or later, and I suppose it was chiefly by reason of this well established belief that lock hospitals were organized for the benefit of the bachelor soldier who will have sexual intercourse, and can attain to it only in promiscuous fashion. So it was probably hoped that the unavoidable disease would be quickly discovered and eradicated This I believe the lock hospital system has thoroughly effected. Nothing has been more marked, as a
25 feature of the general management, than the extreme care evinced by the medical officers to eradicate all possible causes of disease residing in the registered women. And nowhere has this been effected with greater care than at Lucknow. Yet, in the paragraph last quoted, it is stated, apparently in condemnation of the scheme, that during the year more than half the registered women there, were in a condition fitting them to impart disease. As a fact, the monthly average number of registered women at Luckuow was 119, and the monthly average number in hospital 30, leaving a monthly average balance of 89 women perfectly fit for intercourse. And, indeed, the exact balance was 94. For the average in hospital includes 46 unregistered women, each treated for 39 days, equivalent to a monthly average of five. That an average of 25 women, out of 119, should always be in hospital, may appear discouraging, until it is explained that at least 20 of that average were detained in hospital on account of leucorrhoea and abrasion, which are not diseased conditions likely to affect the soldier. These detentions witness emphatically to the care and reality of the management, as exercised for the benefit of the women, who suffer in undue measure from these comparatively trivial complaints, which can only be cured by rest from their occupation. This rest they find while detained in hospital. I have not the slightest doubt that a considerable average of admissions to hospi- tal amongst the women is inseparable from good management. And I think the quite extraordinary amount of good which has resulted to the women of the system, by the establishment of lock hospitals far outweighs in value the money spent upon them. 110. I believe the hitherto bad result of the scheme have arisen entirely from the soldiers perverseness in continuously introducing the disturbing element of inter- course with unprotected women. A practice hurtful to himself, and hurtful to the registered women. These women submit cheerfully to much inconvenience and per- sonal unpleasantness, in obedience to the requirements of the system, and upon the full understanding that it is for the soldiers benefit. But the soldier as a rule takes no heed of this. Over and over again it has been recorded that soldiers bring disease to the registered women ; that they spend their money on unprotected women to the neglect of the protected, who, for livelihood, are driven to receive the visits of native men. The soldiers do this for various reasons, some from dislike to open visitation of the brothel, some from parsimony, an unprotected woman asking very little. But chief reason of all is the extraordinary opportunity afforded to the soldier to offend against the system in this way. The more I learn of this subject the deeper becomes the conviction that, given the presence of women, the soldier cannot abstain from intercourse with them. 111. The obvious course of action then is to keep the soldier away from places where many women must reside, and to remove the unprotected women from places where the soldiers must live. In this course lie the elements of success, and I have no doubt good general results would have followed, if, during the past year, it could have been reported from all stations, as from Lucknow and Roorkee, that unceasing vigi- lance of the authorities for the prevention of every cause of disease bad been exer- cised, and an active interest of the regimental and cantonment authorities, to the extent of keeping all vagrant women out of cantonments, evinced surely, as against them, vagrant women the regimental authorities might, with extreme justice, exercise great vigilance and a considerable severity. As a rule these women are abandoned, half-starved, utterly forlorn, waifs and strays of humanity, quite unfit for sexual intercourse, and very prone to generate disease. No sensible man would venture to approach such women, and the soldier ought not to be allowed to do it. With undoubted certainty such women ought not to 7
( 26 ) be allowed to approach the soldier. Yet, year after year, these vagrants figure in the reports as the worst of all the great unregistered class by which the system is wrecked. They invade even the barracks and their precincts ; they prowl in nalás, ravines, or fields of cantonments, or their neighbourhood (paras. 11, 17,18, 22, 28, 51, 63, 75, 82, 88, 93). Sometimes arrested, they are found in great majority to be severely diseased. They profess to have no home, or accommodation, cleanliness, or immunity from disease. And tinder such conditions it has been frequently reported that a soldier may expect their services for two pice ; or even a chappati has been once recorded as a sufficient reward. It seems hopeless to expect the soldier to resist temptation costing, at the imme- diate moment, so little. In this year's report it has -been recorded that the officers, of a regiment believed their men would not consort with such women, but were speed- ily undeceived (para. 63). 112. It appears but a sensible and considerate thing to ask of Commanding Offi- cers and cantonment authorities so much of help, for the system, as effectual battle against these women would ensure. They can be found by a resolute man without difficulty, know quite well that they are offenders against decency and the laws of health, and once assured of. the unfailing displeasure and severity of these authorities will soon cease to waylay the soldiers. 113. The suppression of this vagrant, open air, form of prostitution, would, in all probability, suffice to ensure successful results for the lock hospital system,. so far as- comparison with results recorded before the hospitals were opened is concerned. But certainly it would not suffice to ensure results, such as might be provided, if all the great company of unprotected women could be weeded out as the disturbing element of the system.. To hope for perfect protection against unlicensed women li- ving in houses, or against such overwhelming temptation as that recorded in the third clause of para. 22, or against ayahs, or other cleanly sometimes fascinating women, is, I think, inconsiderate, and probably unattainable. The system can, I think, survive their attack, so soon as the prowling, vagrant, habitual disease causers, are put out of count. 114. As incontrovertible proof of the correctness of the almost unanimous opinion that intercourse with unlicensed women ruined the results of the management in 1879, it is only necessary to notice the absence of correlation between the diseases of the re- gistered women and the soldiers. Thus, as regards gonorrh( 27 ) of ''all other expenses." At Cawnpore and Agra the combined increase there was Rs. 629, but for that, the total expenditure would have been less than in 1878. The increase, however, is so small as not to merit much attention. Of the total expenditure, Rs. 14,728 was defrayed by Government and Rs. 21,982 from cantonment funds. The respctive totals in 1878 were Rs. 13,876, paid by Government, and Rs. 22,529, paid from cantonment funds. It appears then that the cost to Government has been more by Rs. 852 in 1879. This has arisen en- tirely from an increased payment by Government at Cawnpore of Rs 989, during the year, owing apparently to a change of system, by which, from the 1st of April, only Rs. 47 a month of the expenditure was charged to the cantonment fund against Rs. 189 per mensem previously. I have no doubt there has been good cause for the change. At the same time I should say that experience points to better general results of the management where the expenditure falls upon the resources of the cantonment authorities. Thus, referring to the table of stations showing good results in 1879 (para. 105), the first six stations of the list defrayed their total expenses of lock hospital manage- ment from cantonment funds. And of the stations of bad results (para. 106) seven out of nine had their lock hospital expenditure defrayed, either in greatest measure or altogether, by Government. Points calling for the especial notice of Government. 116. The points in these reports calling for especial notice are:( 28 ) time if my presence can be useful. But the cause of failure is plainly recorded, and can be remedied only by the action of the military authorities. If it is impossible, as reported, to prevent the soldiers intercourse with the unlicensed women of the popula- tion expenditure for lock hospital purposes is useless at Benares. If, as reported, the lock hospital is not in any measure efficient against the spread of disease amongst the soldiers, the obvious inference is that it ought to be abolished. At present the total annual cost, Rs. 2,674, falls upon Government. X.( 29 ) No. 1.30 No.II( 31 ) No. III.SANITATION DEPT. No. 176 OF 1880. FROM THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, N.-W. PROVINCES AND OUDH, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, HOME, REVENUE, AND AGRICULTURAL DEPT. Dated Naini Tal, the 17th August, 1880. SIR, I AM directed to forward, for the information of His Excellency the Governor-General in Council, the annual report on the working of the lock-hospitals in the North-Western Provinces and Oudh for the year 1879. 2.The following table shows the results of the year at each station in regard to admissions of European soldiers into hospital, as compared with the results of the previous five years and the average of five years preceding the introduction of the present system:( 2 ) Bareilly 338.0 Cawnpore 337.8 Ránikhet 313.12 Muttra 253.8 Chakráta 201.9 In every one of these the ratio of disease in 1879 was greater than the recorded ratio prior to the constitution of the hospitals. On the other hand, the figures for the stations of Lucknow, Fyzabad, Jhánsi, Roorkee, and to a less degree Sitapur, show very much better results, whether comparison is made with the preceding five years, or with the years anterior to the introduction of the present system. 4.The figures for the nine hospitals first named render the general result for the year unfavorable, as owing to them the provincial ratio of admissions was 257.3 in 1879, against a mean ratio of 254.3 in the five preceding years. The figures in para. 103 do not tally with those given in para. 99 of last year's report, but it is assumed that the latter ones are correct. The Sanitary Commissioner will be asked to explain the discrepancy. If the other figures be taken as accurate, the result is still more unsatisfactory : as the ratio for 1879 is in this case 257, against an average of 223.5 in the last five years. Prior to the establishment of lock- hospitals, the five years' average was 275 ; and as the cost of these institutions in 1879 amounted to Rs. 36,711 (against Rs. 36,405 in 1878), it would appear that the improvement of 21 per mille is a poor result for the expenditure incurred. 5.The Lieutenant-Governor and Chief Commissioner is of opinion that the Sanitary Commissioner's review and the district reports have brought out more prominently, and with greater clearness than ever, the fact that the prevalence of disease among the soldiers is due almost entirely to their consorting with unlicensed and unregistered women. If they confined themselves to registered women, disease among them would be very greatly diminished, if it did not entirely cease. When such unregistered women are arrested, they are found almost invariably to be suffering from disease of a bad type. It is to the prevention of such illicit prostitution ; to restriction, where necessary, on the freedom of the soldier ; and to the institution of organised measures for preventing the class of women in question from lurking about cantonments and frequent- ing the places open to the soldiers,( 3 ) vention of illicit prostitution,( 4 ) (3) The necessity of a well at Agra in the hospital enclosure (which seems to be made out) is a local matter, to be decided by the committee in communication with the military authorities. (4) Regarding the alleged irregularity of sub-committee meetings at Agra, it seems to the Lieutenant-Governor and Chief Commissioner useless to insist on meetings when there is no business to be transacted. Considering, however, that Agra shows results that are unsatisfactory, it would appear that there is ample field for the sub-committee's work, and I am to invite attention to the subject. The matter would appear to be one for the president of the cantonment committee to regulate. (5) The question of regimental police (Meerut) is one that entirely concerns the military authorities ; a more efficient police of this kind would seem to be much needed. (6) His Honor has much pleasure in acknowledging the good work performed by Dr. Fairland in connection with the laborious and unplea- sant duty of lock-hospital management. The results of the year are a grati- fying proof of the success with which it has been attended. (7) The distinction between local venereal ulcer and primary syphi- lis seems important enough to warrant the introduction of separation between these forms of disease in the returns. As His Honor under- stands it, the one is simply a local affection ; the other, a blood disease in the system. (8) The provision of quarters for medical subordinates is a matter appertaining to the cantonment authorities in communication with the Military Department. (9) The Benares lock-hospital has proved a melancholy failure; and the authorities, while holding that this is due not to the system or to want of care, but to the peculiar circumstances of the cantonments as affording the best possible chance for unlicensed prostitution, suggest that the Sanitary Commissioner should be deputed to visit the place. It is difficult to see what good results can be expected from this, if (as would seem to be admitted) the evil is of the kind above described. But Dr. Planck will be asked to take an early opportunity of examining the place, and of reporting to Government the results of his inspection. (10) The location of the Moradabad hospital within cantonments, instead of in the city, was alluded to in clause 6, para. 6, of last review. It is a matter for the committee to decide. (11) The Lieutenant-Governer considers that a case of relapse, pure and simple, should not be entered in the returns as a new case. But care would have to be exercised that new cases were not included under relapses, the recovered patient having again contracted the disease. (12) The question of enhancement of penalty for unlicensed prostitu- tion was touched on in para. 4 of last year's review. Since then Act III.
( 5 ) of 1880 has become law, but the maximum penalty (Rs. 50 fine, or eight days' imprisonment) remains the same under section 27, (clause 11). If however a fine is levied and cannot be realised (and this would ordinarily be the case in regard to unregistered women), the offender is liable under section 29 to one month's imprisonment. if action were taken on this provision of the law, the penalty, adjudged would in most cases be more adequate. His Honor has nothing further to add to what was said in the 1878 review on this subject. (13) The medical charge of the Muttra lock-hospital was held in 1879 by an apothecary, and doubts are raised as to the expediency of this arrangement. The Lieutenant-Governor and Chief Commissioner does not see why an apothecary should not, if there be good reasons for the measure, be placed in charge. As a matter of fact, the nominations to medical charge of lock-hospitals are made by the military authorities, confirmation being usually a matter of course. The subject does not appear to call for discussion. (14) New arrivals at a military station should always be inspected, as otherwise a man affected with disease may communicate it to regis- tered women. This is a matter, however, for the military authorities to consider. I have the honor to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, C. ROBERTSON, Secretary to Government, N.-W. Provinces and Oudh. No. 177.

Ip/30/HG, 4. ( 8 ) SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE WORKING OF THE LOCK HOSPITALS IN THE NORTH-WESTERN PROVINCES AND OUDH For the year 1880. PRELIMINARY NOTE. I. Paras. 1 to 82 of this report contain a summary of results and remarks recorded in the Annual Reports and papers submitted to Government by the local authorities con- cerned with the management of the Lock Hospital scheme, the hospitals being arranged in ,order of their importance. II. Paras. 83 to 108 contain the opinions and remarks of the, reporting officer, founded in all cases upon evidence plainly discernible in the reports and papers, and always supported by reference to that evidence. III. Para. 109 contains a record ,of the points in those reports and papers which require the special attention of Government. IV. The report concludes with four tables, into which has been gathered all the available statistical information on the subject in simplest possible form. 1. ( 2 ) 4. The Collector and Magistrate thinks much more satisfactory results have bee n recorded in 1880 than have been possible for several years previously. But he is of opinion that no permanent improvement can be expected until, as recommended in 1879, a large lock hospital is provided in the city and all prostitutes registered. 5. The Commissioner considers the results of the year's endeavour very satis- factory. 2.( 3 ) 8. The Colonel Commanding at Cawnpore records the opinion that the manage- ment of the year was comparatively successful, but that a great measure of success cannot be looked for so long as the villages near cantonments are not brought effec- tually under Lock Hospital Rules. The existence of numerous ravines and nullahs at Cawnpore too greatly facilitates illicit intercourse. 9. The Collector and Magistrate thinks the Medical Officer's report is satisfactory, as it shows that all disease of severe type suffered by the soldiers was contracted from unregistered women. The important requirement is the detection and punishment of the unregistered females who cause this disease. The existing orders on this subject are inadequate. The Magistrate suggests a medical inspection of all women suspected on good grounds of consorting with soldiers. 10. The Commissioner notes the considerable falling off in the number of women registered during the year and thinks this unsatisfactory, viewed in connection with the considerable amount of unlicensed prostitution reported, The unlicensed offenders should be brought on to the register. During the past year the names of 70 women were removed from the register( 4 ) Amongst the registered women there was less disease in 1880 than in 1879. For the improvement of the scheme the Medical Officer recommends improved police arrangements for the check of illicit prostitution, an increase to the number of registered women, and the establishment of a chukla. 13. The Cantonment Magistrate records the satisfaction of the Cantonment Com- mittee at the comparatively favourable results recorded for 1880. To check the increase of disease lately established, a special police force has been appointed for the arrest of unlicensed offenders, the city has been placed out of bounds, and the soldiers restricted to passage on the main roads near the Fort. 14. The Magistrate and Collector states that disease amongst the soldiers was comparatively rare until a large detachment of young soldiers arrived from the front with their pockets full of money. These men were about at all hours, not in the city, but off the roads lying between the Fort and the barracks. These places were placed out of bounds after the close of the year. The Magistrate thinks ordinary city pros- titutes do not permit visits of soldiers. The chamar and coolie women of villages neighbouring the city and canton- ments are the source of the disease complained of. The city registration has been increased. The register ought to have included more names before, but the Assistant Magistrate was weak in accepting excuses. The Military authorities should have communicated with the Magistrate when the city registration was believed to be inefficient. A joint, continuous action of the Civil and Military authorities is essential to success in this matter. 15. The Commissioner is of opinion that, having regard to the great increase of disease at the end of the year, there is not much cause for the satisfaction expressed by the Cantonment Committee, for it is clear that no definite check has been given to the spread of venereal disease amongst the soldiers. As usual, the Medical Officer thinks blame rests upon the Civil authorities on account of insufficient city registra- tion, and the Magistrate thinks blame rests upon the Military authorities on account of imperfect police arrangements. Without doubt a number greater than 25 of the city prostitutes should be registered. Soldiers frequently visited the city before it was put out of bounds, and it is pretty sure they know some of the women there. These women should be registered. The Commissioner thinks a young and inexperienced Civil Officer should not be charged with the work of registration in the city. It would be better done by the Cantonment Magistrate, subject to the control of the Magistrate of the district. The Medical Officer's recommendation in regard to the registration of more attractive women is worthy of consideration. The Sub-Committee should assemble at stated intervals of time, and not only when occasion seemed to require it. 4.( 5 ) Sub-Committee existed throughout the year ; no special measures were adopted for the prevention of disease. The Medical Officer still is of opinion that soldiers cohabit with prostitutes of the city who are unregistered. The attendance of the women for examination has been fairly good. Of 70 cases of absence amongst Cantonment women, all were dealt with by fine in 66 and imprison- ment in 4 cases. The admissions to hospital amongst the women were 148 in 1880 against 192 in 1879. Of 38 women newly registered during the year more than 1/3rd were found diseased on first examination. Amongst the women cases of syphilis and cases of gonorrh( 6 ) The Magistrate thinks good results would follow if it was ruled that a soldier diseased with venereal, and failing to point out the woman who caused his disease, was to be punished by the stoppage of the whole of his pay; while, if the soldier could point out the offending woman, he should lose only a half or a quarter of his pay while in hospital. The Magistrate has no doubt that soldiers consort with low class city prostitutes. The better class of city prostitutes would not consort with soldiers on any terms ; and if pressure is put upon the police to discover the women of the city who receive soldiers' visits, a danger arises lest the police should seize the opportunity for extort- ing money from the better class mentioned, upon consideration of not reporting their receipt of soldiers' visits, which would necessitate registration. Therefore the Superintendent of Police has been asked to employ only very trustworthy men in the enquiry before mentioned. The Magistrate enquires whether any European women( 7 ) In all 8 cases of syphilis and 71 cases of gonorrh( 8 ) Diseases Act is in force in the city, but the disestablishment of the city lock hospital some years ago took away the means for making the Act effectual as against prosti- tutes. At the time, it was proposed to bring the city prostitutes unders the operation of the Cantonment Lock Hospital Rules. But to permit of this, the Contagious Disease Act must be first repealed as regards the city. To this step the Government of India would not consent. Under these circumstances, the Local Government ordered the preparation of rules, to be framed in accordance with the provisions of the Contagious Disease Act. The rules were accordingly framed, giving the Cantonment Magistrate effective control over city prostitutes who receive the visits of European soldiers. As before stated, these rules still remain under consideration. 27. The City Magistrate thinks no great extent of disease could have been con- tracted from city women during the year. The Civil authorities have done their best to secure the registration of prostitutes of the city who live near to cantonments and. receive the visits of soldiers. 28. The Commissioner thinks there can be no doubt that much disease is con- tracted in the city, especially during the past year, by the Artillery stationed in the Fort Machi Bhawan, which adjoins the city. And in further proof of this the marked , decrease of disease prevalence when the city had been placed out of bounds must be noted. Without doubt the city lock hospital was useful as preventing disease amongst the soldiers, but its method. of support (in great measure by fees paid by prostitutes) was disaproved by Government, and it was closed. In proof of the correctness of the Medical Officer's statement that newly-arrived soldiers contracted most disease, the Commissioner records the fact that the 72nd Regiment had 50 admissions to hospital for venereal disease in less than a period of six weeks following their arrival. 6.( 9 ) In all 112 cases of disease are believed to have been contracted from registered women. Chiefly disease comes from unregistered women who patrol the roads at night and induce the soldier, often the worse for liquor, to illicit intercourse. But for the presence of these cheap wanderers the soldiers would visit the registered women only. Shooting excursions also afford an opportunity for dangerous illicit intercourse with women. For the prevention of this illicit intercourse the Medical Officer thinks the " vene- real picquet" useless, excepting as a measure of punishment for men who have con- tracted disease. And punishment by making up arrears of duty is also useless to pre- vent disease. The receipt of a ticket by the soldier from the registered woman visited acts well, chiefly as a means of detecting a diseased woman. All the registered women of cantonments have been examined every second day. The Medical Officer praises the system in force, and thinks nothing more effect- ive against disease could be devised. As long as man is a free agent he cannot be kept within the bounds of an institution, although it may be established for his benefit. 31. The file contains no paper emanating from the Cantonment or Military autho- rities. 32. The Magistrate and Collector has no remark to make or new suggestion to offer. 33. The Commissioner forwards the report and returns. He notes a marked decrease of disease for the year amongst the women, and a great improvement in the health of the soldiers, as shown by the figures of the report. The main cause of disease is intercourse of the soldier with unregistered women. As a rule the registered women are old hags, to whom the soldier will not confine his visits. Amongst the village women there is an enormous amount of venereal disease of very bad type, and these women are ready to gratify the soldier for a mere trifle. On the whole the Commissioner thinks the institution has worked well during the year 1880. 7.( 10 ) The soldiers contracted many of their cases from unregistered women. It was proved that three cases of syphilis were contracted from a woman who came from Lucknow, remained a few days in the station, and then returned to Lucknow. The soldiers often pointed out registered women as the cause of their disease. Most often, on examination, the women so pointed out were found quite free from disease ; yet the Medical Officer thinks many cases of disease were contracted from the registered women. The lock hospital system can be made efficient to decrease the amount and virulence of disease, but it cannot banish disease. Forty-nine registered women live in the city, twenty live in the sudder bazaar, and fourteen in the regimental bazaar. Those who live in cantonments are provided with residences, forming a brothel built on the outskirt of the bazaar. A basin, water, soap, and towel are provided in each room for the use of the soldier. The Cantonment Sub-Committee assembled once in every month of the year. A special police force composed of soldiers recovered from venereal disease has been employed to prevent the visits of men to villages near Cantonments. During the year, of 27 unregistered prostitutes arrested six were found diseased. The Medical Officer is of opinion that all women known to be public prostitutes should be registered. He was of this opinion before, and observation of the working of the Lock Hospital scheme has strengthened that opinion. 36. The Deputy Commissioner of the district thinks the statistics very satisfac- tory. 37. The Commissioner forwards the report without remark. 8. ( 11 ) Disease amongst the soldiers in 1880 was slightly in excess of disease in 1879. Nearly half this disease occurred in the three months of cold weather( 12 ) Benares is not a place pestered by vagrant women. The unregistered women who now cause disease to the soldier all have houses. From the day the men can be got to point out the offending woman the matter will be simplified. For there seems no reason why the women should not be punished under sections 269 and 270 of the Indian Penal Code. A person negligently permit- ting small-pox to be disseminated would assuredly be liable to punishment under these sections ; and syphilis is a more dangerous disease than small-pox. Finally, the Collector recommends sanction for the expenditure necessitated for a subsidy, and the issue of stringent orders to the Military authorities to deal energe- tically with the soldiers. 42. The Commissioner is of opinion that the results of the year's work are most unsatisfactory. That( 13 ) probably less virulent than before the. lock hospital system was introduced ; but the prevalence increases in late years, and this may be due to conditions arising out of the famine prevalence of 1877-78. At Moradabad there is no Cantonment bazaar for prostitutes to live in, and there- fore the soldiers visit the city whenever they like. Now, in a Cantonment bazaar measures may be enforced to check the intercourse of soldiers and unregistered women; but in a city no such measures can have force : there a soldier never knows the class of woman he may consort with. And the Medical Officer thinks better results might follow the establishment of a Cantonment place of residence for the prostitutes who receive visits of soldiers. 45. The Colonel Commanding the Rohilkhand District suggests the establishment of a Cantonment bazaar at Moradabad and the location of the Lock Hospital in Canton- ment. 46. The Collector and Magistrate thinks the results are very discouraging. In fact he thinks it doubtful whether any special benefit to the health of the troops results from the maintenance of the lock hospital. The type of the disease prevalent may have been modified by the existence of lock hospitals, but, as far as soldiers are con- cerned, its prevalence is unmitigated. The registered women all live in the city, and as some time ago the city was placed out of bounds to the soldier because of venereal prevalence, it resulted that the services of the registered women were unavailable( 14 ) Precautions wore taken to prevent the practice, by the women, of measures likely to conceal a diseased condition. Cases of admission to hospital amongst the women were more numerous in 1880 than in 1879. The increase of admissions was due to the recognition of leucorrh( 15 ) disease imported with the troops, the results will appear very favourable. At the close of the year the prevalence of disease amongst the men increased ; and measures were taken to combat this prevalence by extra police vigilance and by the adoption of restrictive measures as regards the liberty of the men. Good results followed, on one occasion during the year, from a restriction of the wandering habits of the men. Many coolie women at Ránikhet employed on buildings offer temptations too great for resistance by the soldier. These women will supply the soldier's want for a copper coin and in private. A visit to a registered woman costs more, and has some- thing of the charcter of openly confessed depravity about it. The prevention of this dangerous, yet popular, intercourse with unregistered women can only be effected by the Commanding Officer. Of 8 unlicensed women arrested during the year all were found diseased. One of these persons was living in the hospital servants' quarters. The Sub-Committee assembled on every Cantonment Committee day throughout the year. 56. The Commissioner forwards the report without remark. 12.( 16 ) 62. The Collector and Magistrate remarks that the hospital was temporarily closed, during the absence of the infantry troops, under orders sanctioned by the Com- mander-in-Chief, and re-opened when those troops returned. Neither the Commissioner nor Magistrate were consulted in the matter. The result was hurtful to the women, as shown by the returns. The Cantonment Magis- trate takes great interest in the efficient working of the scheme and has done all in his power to check unlicensed prostitution. 63. The Commissioner notes the large increase of disease amongst the women owing to the closing of the hospital. The Medical and Cantonment authorities are co- operating cordially for the suppression of illicit prostitution, which is really the point upon which successful management depends. And it is probable that the system will continue to work well at Roorkee. 14.( 17 ) The ratios of admissions to hospital for venereal disease amongst the European garrison for the seven years 1874-80 have been 275, 95, 141, 255, 187, 345, and 293 per 1,000 of daily average strength respectively. 69. The Medical Officer reports the hospital accommodation ample. The Hos- pital Assistant requires better quarters, and the hospital servants have no quarters. The fact has been reported for several years past without result. Two chaprassis, employed as detective police, apprehended four women during the year. They were at once registered. Twenty-seven women were reported to the Magis- trate for absence at inspection. Punishments by fine realized Rs. 3 for the year. Disease amongst the women was less in 1880 than in 1879. The Medical Officer is of opinion that the hospital has answered its purpose well during the past year. Little or no disease suffered by the soldiers was traced to the registered women. Most of that disease was distinctly traceable to unregistered hill women lurking about roads and khuds. As most hill women are prostitutes, the two chaprassis employed cannot suppress this evil, although they do arrest a fair propor- tion of the offending women. The women of the hills appear to be saturated with syphilis, or syphilized so that, though they communicate disease freely, they suffer little themselves. A notable point amongst the men who suffer is the rapidity with which secondary symptoms follow a syphilitic sore : mild symptoms, affecting chiefly the skin and mucous membranes and quickly curable. 70. The Commissioner forwards the report without remark. 16.-MUTTRA. 71. During the year 1880 a monthly average of 13 women remained on the register against 19 in 1879. The results of the management have been unsatisfactory. The ratios of admissions to hospital for venereal disease amongst the European garrison for the seven years 1874-80 have been 190, 127, 132, 96, 223, 254, and 378 per 1,000 of daily average strength respectively. 72. The Medical Officer reports that the accommodation is suitable and in good repair. Unlicensed prostitutes are not admitted to the line. One such woman arrested during the year was found diseased. The arrangements for examination are satisfactory. Disease amongst the women has greatly diminished during the last five months of the year. The registered women reside in brothels( 18 ) 75. The Medical Officer reports the locality and accommodation of the hospital suitable ; it is in the centre of the rudder bazaar. In all 20 cases of disease occurred amongst the soldiers. Of these several were contracted on the march prior to arrival at Chakráta, and two cases originated probably from intercourse with coolie women in a khud. All public prostitutes have lived under police control, and the rules laid down for the prevention of disease strictly enforced. The Sub-Committee assembled once in every month. The regimental police took care to prevent the entry of unlicensed women into the lines. The women were regular in attendance for examination. A matron was employed with satisfactory results. 76. The Cantonment Magistrate reports that only two cases of venereal disease were contracted by the soldiers whilst living at Chakráta during the year. Economy of expenditure was carefully effected. Great vigilance has been exer- cised by the Cantonment police for the prevention of unlicensed prostitution, and no unregistered women have been found in the Cantonments. But difficulties will be in the way, preventing a continuance of these good results, when the garrison is strengthened as proposed. And the Cantonment Magistrate suggests the creation of more efficient control, as already recommended in letter No. 157, dated 17th May, 1879, to Super- intendent of the Dún, and No. 125, dated 18th April, 1879, to the Commissioner of the division. 76½. The Superintendent of the Dún forwards the report without remark. 77. The Commissioner notes the results of the management in 1880 are better than for any of the preceding four years. An average of 9 registered women seems insufficient, viewing the strength of the garrison, 313 men. The letters referred to by the Cantonment Magistrate were for- warded to Government. There is no apparent cause for the marked improvement of results recorded in 1880. No unregistered women were found. There is no proof that the police were unusually vigilant. But the record is satisfactory, whatever may have been the cause. 18.( 19 ) succeeding 9 months. The sadar bazaar was placed out of bounds to the soldiers; but it is believed the order has been disobeyed, and that they still contract disease there, for which they blame the registered women. Careful examination of the accused women has, in every instance, shown the injustice of the blame. The Medical Officer has recommended the establishment of a chukla in the sadar bazaar. The women would gladly live there in care of a head-woman : for then they would be less liable to ill-treatment by the soldiers and would get food and clothing. The Medical Officer has no doubt that the excessive disease amongst the soldiers is contracted from the great number of diseased and unregistered women who prowl in the vicinity of the lines or in the sadar bazaar. 80. The Assistant Magistrate remarks that up to date the working of the system must be considered unsatisfactory at Fatehgarh. But in a newly-established institu- tion perfect arrangements could not be expected. The bad results are for the most part due to a refusal of the Hospital authorities to receive all diseased women for treatment, and to neglect of the rules sanctioned by the Government of India. Two women were discharged from hospital as incurable soon after it had been opened. The Cantonment authorities were asked to keep all diseased women in the hospital for treatment. They answered that their funds were insufficient to meet the charge. The committee however are, it would appear, able to meet the charges for a daily average of 12 inmates, which ought to suffice for considerable improvement in regard to disease prevalence eventually. Action must not, however, be confined to the sadar bazaar, where soldiers are sel- dom seen. Special regimental police should patrol, after nightfall, the roads and nullabs or ravines situated near to the lines. It is there the soldier chiefly contracts disease from coolie women, grass-cutters' wives, and other dirty women, and not from respectable prostitutes, who will not receive the visits of European soldiers. Advantage would result from a curtailment of the liberty the soldiers now enjoy to roam, late in the evening, in fields and villages. Of the 18 women whose names were removed from the register, 12 left the dis- trict rather than submit to medical examination, 4 were found to have discontinued prostitution and became as married women, and 2 had been dismissed from hospital as incurable. The 167 cases of women reported absent from examination were chiefly cases of the women who bad left the district. The same names were sent up weekly until they had been struck off the register. All women object strongly to examination, and the Assistant Magistrate thinks it might be sufficient if those found persistently healthy for six months were examined only twice a month instead of four times as now. Properly worked, the hospital should provide favorable results. But all diseased women must be admitted for treatment and the Lock Hospital Rules fully carried out. 81. The Magistrate and Collector thinks the Assistant Magistrate's explanations are satisfactory. He is of opinion that the Cantonment Committee should be guided in their action entirely by the Lock Hospital Rules, No. 2314A of 13th July, 1866, contained in the printed copy of cantonment regulations. 82. The Commissioner is of opinion that the unfavourable results recorded are due to want of energy on the part of the Cantonment Committee. The registration is defective ; watch has not been kept over the villages and nullahs near the barracks. Thoroughly diseased women were discharged from hospital uucured,( 20 ) The Commissioner is of opinion that a medical officer of higher standing than that of Assistant Apothecary should have charge of the hospital. RECORD OF GENERAL RESULTS. 83. During the year 1880 a monthly average of 1,152.3 women remained on the registers of the hospitals, against 1,286.1 in 1879 and 1,350.2 in 1878. The figures may be found in table I., and they evidence a persistent decline in the number of the women brought under control. This decline in 1880 equalled a monthly average of 133.8 women as compared with the average of 1879, and 197.9 as compared with the average of 1878. The total number of women brought under control is by no means in excess of the number required for the effectual working of the system. Indeed, the first essential of success is a liberal supply of registered women, and think it may serve a good purpose to direct attention to the hospitals which Provide the worst results in this respect. 84. These are( 21 ) Also a certain number of women in every year are admitted to hospital and found unfit for registration after cure. The reports and returns do not furnish exact information as to the number of newly-registered women found diseased and treated prior to registration, or the number of women treated who are not afterwards registered. But assuming that they numbered 500 in all in 1880, it follows that 1,384 cases of con- tagious disease occurred amongst the women on the register. And without doubt this is a very serious amount of disease to have to acknowledge to in the persons of the women who are expected, by the scheme, to provide with safety for the soldier's wants. 87. The cause of this great amount of disease is not far to seek. It comes from soldiers who have contracted it from unregistered women, and it comes from native men, whose visits the registered women receive as a means of livelihood whenever the soldiers neglect them (paras. 7, 12, 39, 44, and others). 88. Disease amongst the soldiers has been rather more in 1880 than in 1879. The very unfavourable results at Fatehgarh, where a hospital was newly opened during the year, has caused this unfavourable result (table IV.) Deducting the figures for Fatehgarh, which are eloquent in proof of the necessity of lock hospital management there( 22 ) 91. On the other hand, it is well to consider what the reports say about the causes of success, wherever that has been recorded, taking for examples :( 23 ) From Meerut (pars, 19) :( 24 ) increase continued amongst companies of soldiers living in camp at the rifle range. This disease was virulent and undoubtedly contracted from women of villages neigh- bouring the camp." From Benares (para. 39) :( 25 ) Although unhelped by any lock hospital establishment, for an officer of such merit the lock hospital scheme provides the very reason required to justify punish- ment for disobedience. And so helped, he may realize the very best results attain- able. On the other hand, granted the best lock hospital management in conjunction with indifferent management of the men, and the results will assuredly be unfavour- able. 102. Seeing that this is entirely a medical endeavour in favour of the English soldiers, I think it reasonable to suppose that, under the newly-established medical administrative organization, its management will fall into the hands of the Army Medical Department. If that should happen, and the course seems strictly just, I hope this may be the last occasion upon which annual report concerning it will be required at the hands of an Indian Medical Officer in civil employ. I think better results may come from the direct appeals, strictures, or remarks of a Medical Officer standing in close relation with and holding office in the army ; more especially as the words of a trusted officer of that branch of the service would be likely to reach and move the chief commanders to countenance a control of the soldier's freedom of selection in regard to sexual intercourse. Chiefly from this cause, which strikes at the root of the endeavour, has failure hitherto resulted. 103. One other cause of failure must be mentioned. In all these years with which my reports have been associated, the lock hospital scheme has had to struggle against the blighting influence of short service. Cautious old soldiers have gone away to be replaced by reckless young men, always described in the local reports as fond of unlicensed women and prone to disease. Upon this point in 1880, from Cawnpore it is recorded (para. 7): ( 26 ) maintained. That is not my opinion by any means. Rather I believe that the Rs. 31,768 expended for it in 1880, only Rs. 11,968 of which was charged to Go- vernment, was the best applied sum of money expended in all the year throughout the empire. The returns prove that 50,128 carefully performed medical inspections were effected; 204 suffering women supported in hospital ; 2,930 cases of disease cured, of which 1,884 were contagious in character; and 964 women controlled and in consider- able measure cared for and advised by medical talent generally of a high order. How much of common suffering and pain was thus prevented it is impossible to say, but of certainty the measure was considerable. 106. That the full measure of benefit possible to him was not realized by the soldier has not been owing to bad hospital management. Without doubt the soldiers have contracted disease from the registered women, but never to any very marked extent, as the reports from all stations show. An undoubted source of good to the soldier has arisen from the necessity which arises under the action of the scheme of bringing to light at once any excessive prevalence of disease amongst them. Then steps have been taken to mitigate the prevalence. On this point, from Cawnpore it is reported (para. 7) :( 27 ) POINTS REQUIRING THE ESPECIAL NOTICE OF GOVERNMENT. 109.

I AM directed to forward, for the information of His Excellency the Governor-General in Council, the Annual Report on the working of the Lock Hospitals in the North-Western Provinces and Oudh, for the year 1880. 2. This, which has been prepared as usual by the Sanitary Commis- sioner, Surgeon-Major Planck, is again a record of much to be deplored failure, so far as the prevention of venereal disease amongst British sol- diers is concerned,( 2 ) expenditure was per woman registered, Rs. 27-9-2 ; per woman examined, Rs. 32-15-3 ; per case of disease treated, Rs. 10-14-5. These amounts vary little from last year, when they were Rs. 28-8-4, Rs. 33-1-7, and Rs. 10-9-9, respectively. 5. But the real test of success is the extent to which the spread of disease amongst British soldiers was checked. Statement IV. appended to the report shows the prevalence of venereal disease amongst soldiers of the European garrisons during 1880, also in the previous five years, and for five years before the opening of lock hospitals. The daily aver- age strength of European garrisons at the 17 stations( 3 ) soldiers contract disease not from registered but from unregistered women. 8. As regards the soldiers themselves, the four great causes of failure are summed up by Dr. Planck as follows :( 4 ) exercised.

Looking to the nature of the work, it is not to be wondered at that now that there is a separate Army Medical Department, Dr. Planck expresses his hope that this will be the last time an Indian Medical Officer in civil employ is required to write the report. The Military Department will be asked whether it is desired that the present arrange- ment should continue. 12. There can be no doubt Dr. Planck is quite right when he says (para. 101)( 6 ) No. 132.

The Cantonment Magistrate reports the results as less satisfactory than last year. The infantry suffered more than the artillery. During the months of September and December the admissions to hospital amongst the soldiers was abnormally high; for this no satisfactory reason can be assigned. It cannot be denied that soldiers at Allahabad frequently have intercourse with unregistered women, for the registered women are a most unattractive lot, and live in hovels not fit for a European to enter. But it is easy to understand that the registered women may cause much mischief, as they never of their own free will go to hospital. A registered woman may be examined and found well on Saturday, may contract disease on Sunday, and engage in prostitution for the five succeeding days undetected, and, if much sought after, may do considerable damage in those five days. Dhais are not employed, as they are useless at Allahabad, where the registered women, in varying proportions, reside in not less than 29 different villages, muhallas, or bazaars. Under these circumstances, the women cannot be managed as regards cleanliness of house or person. If the women were brought together, dhais might be of great use for the detection of disease in the interval of examination days. Accom- modation for 25 women exists in the infantry and artillery bazaars, but the women, for some reason, will not inhabit it. The reason given by one woman was, that, whilst residing there, she could not earn her livelihood.

This officer advises that all prostitutes should be registered and classified into( 4 ) The Medical Officer is of opinion that unregistered prostitutes are few in num ber in the cantonments, and the police have exercised a careful scrutiny over them, to the prevention of much unlicensed intercourse with soldiers. But in the city many unregistered prostitutes reside, and against harm in this direction there is no practical remedy. As regards the cantonments the registration is complete, and during the last six months of the year only two unregistered prostitutes were discovered. In June, 1881, the Medical Officer of the lock hospital relieved the Civil Surgeon of the duty of examining the city women, under the orders of the Commander-in-Chief. Disease amongst the registered women in 1881 was considerably less than in 1880, and gener- ally their diseases were mild in character and easily cured. The Medical Officer is of opinion, that the existing plan of keeping the registered women in three separate localities is better, than bringing them all to live in one place, as tending to prevent the disorderly scenes which might arise from the con- gregation, at one place and hour, of men of different corps. He strongly recommends a grant of rent-free quarters to the women, who earn only enough to feed and clothe themselves properly. This concession is greatly required at Cawnpore, where the ox- isting accommodation enjoyed by the women is thoroughly unsatisfactory. 9. The Cantonment Committee consider the result of the year's management satisfactory. They concur with the Medical Officer in thinking the women should be provided with rent-free quarters, which should be located in three separate places far apart. 10. The Magistrate of the District notes that the satisfactory results of the year's management have been due to Dr. Seaman's assiduous attention to his duties as Medical Officer. The Magistrate approves the activity displayed by the police for the prevention of forbidden intercourse. 11. The Commissioner of the Division notes a decrease in the number of registered women, which cannot be considered quite satisfactory, in view of the unlicensed prostitution known to prevail. Special explanation should have been given in regard to the fact, that while 59 names were removed from the register, only 39 were added to it. Without doubt most of the cases of virulent venereal disease affecting the soldiers were communicated to them from unlicensed prostitutes; for, at a period of the year when the soldiers were most diseased, the registered women were entirely free from disease. The Commissioner accords praise to the police for the activity displayed in arresting the unregistered women who had caused this disease amongst the soldiers. He thinks the results of the management witness favourably in regard to the working the system during the period of report. 3.( 5 ) calculation, the daily average strength of the garrison has been taken to be 1,592 The true daily average of strength for the year was 1,114, and the ratio of cases 232 per 1,000.) A large majority of the soldiers' venereal affections must have been contracted from unlicensed women, as out of 56 instances of reported infection by registered women, only in eight were there any grounds for the charge. The Lock Hospital Committee meets whenever there is anything special to bring before it. Measures taken to check unlicensed prostitution met with little success during the year. Twelve men were employed by the regimental authorities as a regi- mental police, but they could be of little use. The unlicensed women do not live in the sadr or regimental bazaars, but lurk after dark about the outskirts of the city and near the fort. It is calculated that more than 1,000 prostitutes live in the city, of whom only 59 were registered. These registered persons are generally old and ugly. A younger and cleaner variety might well be brought on to the register. The registered women are divided into two sets( 6 ) the year. The weekly returns of venereal prevalence amongst the soldiers were regularly received during the year. The results have, the Medical Officer thinks, been most unsatisfactory; the ratio of disease for the year having been 215.9, the mean of the 13 previous years being 103.6 only. The highest ratio was recorded amongst the artillery. Of 310 cases of disease which occurred amongst the soldiers, 259 are recorded as having been con- tracted in unnamed localities of Meerut. Of 65 registered women accused of com- municating disease, only 22 were found diseased on examination. A Sub-Commit- tee was in existence throughout the year. For the prevention of disease, passes were withdrawn from women hawking goods for sale in the artillery lines. A military police, of one non-commissioned officer and four men, had special instructions to prevent strange women from entering or loitering about the barracks. Medical in- spections of all unmarried soldiers were effected at uncertain periods( 7 ) women, who should be registered, escape registration by denying consort with European soldiers. Stringent orders have again been issued to the police on this subject, but until all public women( 8 ) The ratio off admissions to hospital for venereal disease amongst the soldiers was 259.0 per 1,000. (This is the ratio as calculated upon an average strength of 2,502 men. But the daily average strength was 2,489, and the correct ratio 261.1 per 1,000.) Amongst the registered women the prevailing disease was gonorrb( 9 ) 6.( 10 ) garrison, have been 333, 503, 345, 211, 196, 158, 143, and 195 per 1,000 of average daily strength. 32. The Medical Officer reports a sufficient hospital accommodation, but as yet no accommodation at the hospital has been provided for the Hospital Assistant in charge. Amongst the registered women there was a great decrease of disease in 1881 as compared with 1880( 11 ) pean garrison, have been 370, 341, 479, 479, 333, 470,486, and 295 per 1,000 of daily average strength. 37. The Medical Officer reports a slight decrease in the number of women regis- tered during the year, there having been 60 on the register on the 1st January and 49 on the 31st December. Amongst the women 143 cases of disease were detected, chiefly of mild type, and only 22 cases in all of syphilis( 12 ) 9.( 13 ) women As much disease appears to have occurred, when the city was out of bounds, as during the rest of the year. The existence of the lock hospital is beneficial to the general population, but its benefit to the soldiers is doubtful. The establishment of a brothel in cantonments would not probably result in decrease of disease amongst the soldiers. 45. The Commissioner of the Division summarizes the report. He requests attention to the Medical Officer's statements, that considerable disease prevailed amongst the registered women, who receive the visits of natives, but are seldom visited by soldiers, with the exception of the older and less presentable portion of them; and that of 26 unregistered women arrested, 11 were found diseased. The Commissioner is of opinion that the unregistered women, who undoubtedly cause the chief portion of the disease, are not city prostitutes, but poorest village women of low caste, who permit intercourse for a pice or two. City prostitutes demand more than a soldier can give. A lock hospital distant from the cantonments is not likely to be useful, and sol- diers will not visit, old and ugly registered hags, while they can meet younger and better-looking women. 10.( 14 ) was in the hands of the civil authorities during the greater part of the year. The Commissioner is of opinion that the realization of fines, and the expenditure of the money for the use of patients, is irregular. An account should have been rendered by the Medical Officer, and has been called for.* 11.( 15 ) 12.(16) 59. The Lieutenant-General Commanding considers the working of the lock hospital a success, but thinks venereal disease cannot be decreased so long as unlicensed women infest the barracks. The Act, for their suppression, should be at once put in force. 13.( 17 ) 65. The Cantonment Magistrate remarks upon the above, that there was only slight increase of disease amongst the soldiers, and not great increase as stated by the Medical Officer. This slight increase was doubtless due to intercourse with village women, whose identity is difficult of discovery, and who, if discovered, could hardly be treated as public prostitutes. Fines of Rs. 5 each were realized, from two women, for the offence of remaining at Roorkee in the practice of prostitution, after return- ing their registration tickets on plea of taking their departure. 66. The Commissioner of the Division forwards the report with the remarks that a properly-situated hospital building, in lieu of a hired house in the bazaar, is a desideratum at Roorkee. It is obvious that one chaukidar cannot remain always on watch. That there seems to have been rather less disease amongst the soldiers in 1881 than in 1880 ( 18 ) 69. The Commanding Officer forwards the report without remark. 70. The Commissioner of the Division desires to place on record the opinion, that the lock hospital system is not confined, as the Medical Officer appears to think, to the medical treatment of the sufferers from disease, but embraces every means for the prevention of disease and detection of offenders. This can be effected only by the military authorities, including the Medical Officer, and the lock hospital report should include a resumé of all efforts made in this direction. As a remarkable fact, Naini Tal swarmed with hill women, during the season of 1881, employed on protective works( 19 ) diseases. In the five months, June to October, whilst many cases of disease occurred amongst the soldiers, not one case was recorded amongst the registered women. And without doubt, disease was contracted from unregistered women in Jhánsi city or amongst the rocks and ravines of the cantonment neighbourhood. This peculiarity of the site makes detection extremely difficult. 74. The Commissioner of the Division thinks the results of the year's manage- ment are as good as can be expected( 20 ) Amongst the soldiers there was a great amount of disease, in all 257 cases, of which 41 were contracted on the line of march from Jabalpur. This disease was due to the prevalence of illicit prostitution, to the abolishment of punishment for the offence of concealing disease, and to the remissness of the police authorities. The Sub-Committee assembled monthly and the venereal returns were received regularly. All public prostitutes are supposed to be under the control of the police, but irregularities have been discovered. The regimental police have taken care to prevent the entrance, to the lines, of suspicious characters. 81. The Cantonment Magistrate reports, that the extremely unsatisfactory results were due, to the small number of registered women, and to facilities the soldiers have for intercourse with unregistered women outside and also within the canton- ments( 21 ) 84. Further, the file is increased by a letter addressed to the Surgeon-General, North- Western Provinces and Oudh, by the Medical Officer, under date the 26th March, 1882. This letter reports, for earnest and earliest consideration, the disgraceful over- crowding existent in the lock hospital, and its entire unsuitability for its intended purpose. At date of writing the hospital contained 20 patients (some having young children) locked in a room 33 x 9 or 10 feet, without sufficient light, or air. The conservancy-accommodation imperfectly provided in a small attached room, 18 x 9 feet. Stench and dirt beyond description result from this overcrowding. This state of affairs has been frequently reported, and still the matter of improvement is in abeyance. The Medical Officer points out that until 1874 the lock hospital at Chakráta was of the 2nd class, in charge of a Medical Officer at Rs. 50 per mensem. It was then reduced to the position of 3rd class in charge of a medical subordinate at Rs. 20 per mensem. On the 7th August, 1881, the General Commanding the Division directed the Staff Surgeon to take over charge, on account of the great increase of venereal disease reported by the Deputy Surgeon-General. But at the same time no steps were taken to ensure a return of the hospital to the 2nd grade, with increased charge pay. As a result, from the date in question, the Medical Officer has received only Rs. 20 per mensem for the charge, and has not enjoyed the assistance of an Hospital Assistant( 22 ) 89. The Magistrate of the District thinks the results satisfactory. During the year a careful enquiry was instituted with a view to ensuring that every public prostitute of the sudder bazaar should be registered, and the Magistrate thinks that only one or two really unregistered public prostitutes now live there. He questions the accuracy of the Medical Officer's statement, to the effect, that the soldiers' disease is chiefly due to their consort with unregistered women of the sudder bazaar. The women who cause the mischief may belong to the regimental bazaar or even to Farukhabad city. Further, it is probable that disease is contracted from coolie and other women, who cannot be deemed prostitutes, or brought under the rules. And the Magistrate protests against the custom of attributing disease prevalence to neglect on the part of the civil authorities. 90. The Commissioner of the Division notes that the report is not accompanied by the usual statistical statements, and contains no mention of a sub-committee or its work. It also appears that an Hospital Assistant was in charge. This inefficient arrangement was complained of last year. The Commissioner is of opinion that a properly qualified Medical Officer should have charge of a lock hospital, otherwise efficient management will not result. The work, being distasteful, will not be properly performed by a subordinate officer. There appears to have been an improvement in results, as regards decrease of disease amongst the soldiers, during the year. The Commissioner calls attention to the Magistrate's record of endeavour to exercise efficient control over the sudder bazaar women. RECORD OF GENERAL RESULTS. 91. During the year 1881 a monthly average of 1,145 women remained on the registers. For the four years, 1878-81, the averages have been 1,350, 1,286, 1,152, and, as above, 1,145. The record witnesses to a persistent decline in the number of registered women, and this decline, as regards the year 1881, becomes still more marked from a consideration of the fact that 18 lock hospitals were open in that year, against 17 in the previous years of the series. Deducting the 53 newly-registered women at Sitapur, the average for the 17 remaining hospitals falls to 1,092. 92. The first element of success in this endeavour is undoubtedly a full supply of presentable registered women. I think, the women should at least equal in number a ratio of ten per cent. of the European garrison. The European garrison of the N.-W. P. and Oudh in 1881 was 14,372, and ten per cent. of that strength is 1,437. The average of women in 1881 was 1,145, a number therefore very much below the efficient requirement. Looked at in that light, indeed, it is necessary to make a deduction of the average number of women in hospital, if the real figure of efficient force is required. This number in 1881 was 221, leaving 924 monthly average of efficient women. This persistent decline, in the strength of registered women, is becoming a serious element of hindrance to the expectation of success, in regard to this scheme of disease prevention. And it is necessary for me to direct attention to the localities of its chief incidence. This may be done briefly and emphatically in form of table record as below:( 23 ) 93. Further, I should mention that the reports contain evidence, favouring the opinion, that in some instances this gradually decreasing force of women are becoming the residue, of unpresentable persons, remaining after the departure of the better- looking class. In para. 3 they are described as a "most unattractive lot."( 24 ) 97. And here it seems necessary I should point out, that the cure of diseased registered women is only one feature of this management, and that by no means the most important. Hitherto I have supposed that this was well understood, but in this year's series of reports, there comes proof, that the knowledge is not universal. From Naini Tal (para. 68) there arises a complaint that I have, in saying it was not satisfactory, unfairly judged the management there for the year 1880. As a matter of fact, I do not judge anything in this report, or desire in any statement to award praise or blame to any person. The statements of the report rest upon the proof of facts and figures reported( 25 ) In all stations, the ratio of contagious disease prevalence amongst the registered women was high. I select a few for special record:- Station. Monthly average of women. Cases of contagious disease. Ratio per cent. Allahabad 137 334 295.5 Cawnpore 108 203 178.7 Meerut 94 249 264.8 Benares 56 125 223.2 Moradabad 67 168 250.7 Sháhjahánpur 42 135 321.4 Roorkee 34 132 388.2 Chakráta 19 53 289.4 101. In every year, this serious prevalence of disease, amongst the registered women, is seen to prevail. And I bring the fact more prominently to notice, this year, to illustrate the extraordinary disease perils of this class of women, and to empha- size the necessity of frequent examination, as the only safe means of disease preven- tion. Para. 20 contains an influential opinion, favouring the less frequent examina- tion of the women, as a means of encouragement to registration. Para. 3 records an opinion, favouring the more frequent examination of the women by matrons, as a means of disease prevention. Of these conflicting opinions, I can only say, expe- rience supports that last expressed. Managed as the scheme now is( 26 ) 105. It will serve no good purpose to quote the paragraphs proving the existence of this great source of disease, as any reader, of the summaries the report contains, will find, that wherever the cause of the soldiers' disease is discussed, chief position is given to this potent factor of disturbance. Generals, Commissioners, Commanding Officers, Magistrates, Doctors( 27 ) evil, the services of steady men of high character are required, and this is not likely to be, generally, the status of soldiers who have suffered from venereal disease. 109. The expenditure on account of the lock hospitals in 1881 exceeded that for 1880 by Rs. 3,985. This increase was due chiefly to the facts,( 28 ) II.( 29 ) No. 1.( 30 ) No. II.( 31 ) No. Ill.No. 96 OF 1882. FROM THE OFFG. SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, N.W.

SIR, I AM directed to forward, for the information of His Excellency the Governor-General in Council, the Annual Report on the working of the Lock Hospitals in the North-Western Provinces and Ondh, for the year 1881, together with the following remarks. 2. The number of lock hospitals open during the year was 18, the same as in 1880. Of these, eight were of the first class, six of the second class, and four of the third class. The total number of prostitutes registered in the lock hospitals was 1,756, as compared with 1,785 in 1880, or a decrease of 29 ; while 670 removed their names, died or absconded during the year, against 693 last year. The monthly average of prostitutes on the registers was 1,145, as compared with 1,152 in 1880 ; and the monthly average attending for periodical examinations was 981 against 964. The total number of cases reported to the Magis- trate for non-attendance in the year was 993 against 875 ; and the total number of cases of disease discovered and retained for treatment in the year was 3,1.77, as compared with 2,952 in 1880. The number of cases treated for non-venereal, leucorrh( 2 ) that the cost of treatment slightly increased. The causes of the increased expenditure are explained in para. 109 of the report; and except in so far as lessened economy is said to be one of them, they seem to be satisfac- tory. *Average daily strength of European garrison in 1880 ... 9,954 Ditto ditto in 1881 ... 14,411 4. Statement No. IV. shows the prevalence of venereal disease amongst soldiers of the European garrisons during 1881, its prevalence in the previous five years during which lock hospitals were in operation, and for five years before the opening of the lock hospitals.

Lucknow and Chakráta are most conspicuous for falling off; while Moradabad and Sitapur, as before mentioned, show the worst actual results of all. 6. The general results of' the year's working of the lock hospital system in the North-Western Provinces and Oudh are reviewed by the Sanitary Commissioner in paragraphs 90-109 of his report. He calls atten- tion to the fact that there has been a persistent falling off during the last four years in the number of registered women. This number he thinks ought at least to equal 10 per cent. of the European garrison of the provin- ces. The strength of the garrison in 1881 was 14,372; consequently there should have been 1,437 registered women attached to the lock hospitals, whereas there were 1,145 only. The falling off in 1881 was the more serious, because the strength of the European garrison rose from 9,954 to 14,411. Further, the Sanitary Commissioner remarks that, although from his own observation he is of opinion that the personal unattractive- ness of the registered women is not so great as reports would indicate, yet in some cantonments the registered women are undoubtedly becoming the residue of unpresentable persons remaining after the departure of the better-looking class. He reports that during 1881 a greater amount of venereal disease was discovered among the registered women than in any previous year. Reasons for this have not been given. But as regards the prevalence of disease among the European garrison of these provinces, the portion of it quartered at Moradabad and Sitapur excepted, the year's management has been, as already remarked, comparatively somewhat successful. The Sanitary Commissioner is satisfied that the medical officers in charge of the hospitals apply themselves earnestly to the detection and cure of disease among the registered women. Nevertheless, care in selecting and encouraging the registered women, and strictness in examination and skill in their treatment when diseased, will not prevent the occurrence of disease among the soldiers, unless some means be devised of removing opportunities for its being contracted by the soldiers from unregistered women, and communicated by them and by men of the general public to the registered women. Admitting that some portion of the disease among the soldiers is derived from registered women, there cannot be any doubt that by far the greater part of it is due to intercourse with unregistered women. The Sanitary Commissioner remarks that the results of the management of the lock hospital system are governed by
( 4 ) its working as a whole ; and he points out that, in addition to the control of the registered women, two chief points in the lock hospital scheme, if it is to be successful, are the reasonable control of the soldiers, and the management of the unregistered women with whom they consort. 7. The essentials then to the better prevention of disease amongst soldiers seem to be( 5 ) to appoint a joint committee of civil, military, and medical officers to examine and report on the causes of comparative failure, and to consider what measures should be adopted to remove them. The subject requires to be dealt with as a whole, and not merely in connection with the special circumstances of any particular cantonment; and the question of the dis- ciplinary measures to be enforced towards the soldier is one with which the civil authorities are not competent to deal. 9. In paragraph 110 the Sanitary Commissioner again urges that the management of lock hospitals, and the duty of reporting on them should be transferred to the Army Medical Department. In this view the Lieutenant-Governor and Chief Commissioner is disposed to concur. Reference was made to this point in paragraph 11 of the review on the last report, and I am to enquire whether it is desired that the present arrangement should continue. 10. The points requiring the special notice of the Government are stated by the Sanitary Commissioner in paragraph 111 of the report. Some of them have been noticed in previous years, and the Lieutenant-Governor and Chief Commissioner regrets that so little notice seems to have been taken of the suggestions and recommendations made regarding them. In so far as want of available funds has prevented compliance with recom- mendations which were made, it would appear to be for the Military Department to consider whether additional funds ought to be, or can be, supplied.

Dated Naini Tal, the 4th August, 1883. SIR, I AM directed to forward, for the information of His Excellency the Governor-General in Council, the annual report on the working of the lock hospitals in the North-Western Provinces and Oudh for the year 1882, together with the following remarks. 2. There were, as in 1881, 18 lock hospitals open during the year, of which eight were of the first class, six of the second class, and four of the third class. The results of their working during the year, and the opinions expressed by the local authorities, are commented on in detail in section I. of the report, and the results are also tabulated in the four statements appended to it. The total expenditure on lock hospitals during the year was slightly less than last year, having been Rs. 35,583 as compared with Rs. 35,853. Towards this expenditure Government con- tributed Rs. 8,988, and cantonment funds Rs. 26,595. The Jhánsi and Cawnpore Cantonment funds, which last year received assistance from. Government, bore the whole of the charges this year without such aid. The fines realised amounted to Rs: 262. According to statement III. the average cost per woman registered, per woman examined, and per case of disease, was respectively Rs. 32-11-3, Rs. 37-11-8, and Rs. 12-4-0, compared with Rs. 31-5-0, Rs. 36-8-8, and Rs. 11-4-6 in 1881. The apparent increase in the cost of treatment is explained as due to the diminution in the number of registered prostitutes. In Benares, where the average number of women on the register is very much less than at any other lock hospital of the first class, the average cost was very high, and Dr. Planck proposes that Ránikhet, which has a much larger num- ber of women on the register, should change places in the grading with Benares. The proposal appears to be reasonable, and might be acted upon. 3. Statement No. IV., showing the prevalence of venereal diseases amongst the soldiers of the European garrisons during 1882, brings out somewhat unsatisfactory results. With a smaller number of troops than last year, there is a decided increase in the number of admissions to hospital for venereal diseases. The results attained varied considerably at the different hospitals, and while the management of some was fairly satisfactory, that of others was apparently productive of little or no good. The daily average strength of the European garrison in these provinces in 1881 and 1882 was 14,411 and 13,291 respectively, while the number of admissions to hospital for venereal diseases was 3,340 and 3,506, and
(2) the ratio of admissions per 1,000 of strength was respectively 232 and 264. The mean ratio of the preceding five years was 255. The past year then compares unfavourably not only with an exceptionally successful year like 1881, but with the normal results of several years past. During the five years previous to the opening of the lock hospitals the mean ratio was 278, which is exceeded this year in eight out of the 18 stations at which there are lock hospitals. The year 1881 was described by the Sanitary Commissioner as "the first year of success as regards results of lock hospital management." But in 1882 the success has not been main- tained, and in paragraph 104 of his report he says, "a certain and very real amount of good has resulted from the expenditure entailed, in that a vast amount of venereal disease amongst the women has been cured. But apparently no appreciable good has resulted as regards the preven- tion of disease amongst the soldiers. It is for Government to determine whether under these circumstances the expenditure involved should con- tinue." The report brings clearly into view the causes of this failure, and these have been so often referred to in former reports without elicit- ing remark or action from the authorities to whom these reports are submitted, that it is unnecessary to allude to them at length again. 4. The causes of the success attained or failure incurred in the vari- ous lock hospitals are made sufficiently clear in the local reports. Success was due to the keeping up of a good supply of registered women, to the Provision of adequate accommodation for them, to efficient police arrange- ments preventing intercourse with unregistered women, or to a combination of these. Failure, on the other hand, resulted from a scanty supply of regis- tered women, want of suitable accommodation, or ineffective police arrangements and inability to prevent the soldiers having intercourse with unregistered women. The control of the soldier is a matter for the military authorities; but Dr. Planck again urges that the provision of free quarters in cantonments for the women, who now live scattered about in bazaars, would, besides bringing them more under control, probably induce a larger number to register themselves, and secure a better and more attractive class of women. He states, however, that any measures of this kind have now been rendered impossible by the order of the Gov- ernment of India in the Military Department, No. 772S.-C., dated 25th August, 1882, to the effect that "it has been decided to allow the con- tinuance of the lock hospital system on the understanding that no more outlay is to be incurred in the construction of buildings for such institu- tions." This order had not been previously communicated to this Govern- ment, so that the Lieutenant-Governor and Chief Commissioner is not aware of its precise scope and intention; but if, as Dr. Planck seems to assume, no more expenditure is to be incurred in providing suitable accommodation at lock hospitals, many of them had probably better be closed at once. 5. The essentials to the success of the lock hospital system were fully dealt with in the 6th and 7th paragraphs of the review of last year's report, and in the 8th paragraph the appointment of a joint committee of civil, military, and medical officers was recommended to consider, the measures necessary for securing the efficient working of the system. It was also recommended that the management of lock
(3) hospitals, and the duty of reporting on them, should be transferred to the Army Medical Department. No orders have been received in regard to these suggestions ; and the Lieutenant-Governor does not now press the recommendation for a committee, unless the Government of India are distinctly resolved that the system needs a change, and that the change shall be made. In regard to the proposed transfer of management, it seems very expedient that general management should follow financial control, as the Local Government can hardly undertake responsibility for the working of the lock hospitals if the buildings are not to be kept in decent repair. It is much better that the Army Medical Department should manage the hospitals, with the co-operation of the Civil Govern- ment, but under the direction of the Military authorities.

( 5 ) The Commissioner thinks it is to be regretted that timely intimation of the movement of troops into camp was not communicated to the Magistrate; as then precautionary measures would have been taken to prevent the access of diseased women to the soldiers. It is a notorious fact that whenever soldiers have access to. unregis- tered women disease becomes rife, as in this case of 20 soldiers found diseased after return from camp. With regard to rent-free accommodation for the women, the Commissioner has no doubt that by this step the women would be made more comfortable and perhaps more attractive. But he doubts the realization of beneficial results from this step, because of the soldier's decided preference for unregistered women, who are the princi- pal source of his disease. 3.( 6 ) The city inspection room was closed from 1st January, 1883, under orders received through the Quartermaster-General. It cost Rs. 516 per annum, paid from cantonment funds. And the Municipal authorities have been invited to re-establish it in the interests of the general population and of the soldiers who protect the city. It does not appear likely that the proposal will meet with assent. In the meanwhile the city registered women were directed to attend the cantonment lock hospital for examination. Probably because of the distance to be traversed, from 1½ to 2 miles, many absented themselves. In consideration of the comparative nearness of the city to the fort and the barracks, and the great number of the resident prostitutes, the Cantonment Com- mittee think the regular examination of all city prostitutes suspected of consort with soldiers is of the last importance. And they view the abolition of the city inspection room with considerable misgiving. They think, indeed, that the number of city registered women ought to be largely increased, and that the Cantonment Magistrate should supervise the work. But the question of jurisdiction may bar the way to this supervision. With reference to the remarks of the Government in the report for 1881, encourag- ing the grant of free quarters to the registered women, the Cantonment Magistrate reports that at Agra, so far as the women attached to the infantry regiment are con- cerned, good and suitable quarters exist, yet not rent-free. But the greater portion of the registered women reside in scattered houses in the bazaars, and their proper supervision is well nigh impossible. The committee would gladly provide the free quarters in question, if so permitted. With reference to the water-supply of the hospital, it is explained that the water of a well immediately adjacent to the hospital building is brackish, and that of necessity drinking water must be brought from the sweet water well in the can- tonment gardens. 14. The Magistrate of the district confesses to inexperience of the subject hin- dering useful comment. He considers the closing of the city inspection room is to be regretted, as likely to have prejudicial results upon the health of the troops during the present year. The question of re-establishing the inspection room was laid before the municipal committee who unhesitatingly rejected it. Native public opinion is by no means in favour of the Contagious Diseases Act. The municipal committee read the orders of Government extending the Act to Agra, as expressing that the extension is with a view to prevent venereal disease amongst the soldiers, and they are therefore of opinion that the necessary expenditure should fall upon the Military Department. The question of jurisdiction will be considered hereafter. 15. The Commissioner remarks that the results of the management, for 1881 and 1882, appear to be about the same. The monthly meeting of the sub-committee is satisfactory, especially as in former years this important point had been neglected. The frequent change of Medical Officers in charge of the hospital is to be regretted as not tending to efficient supervision. Without doubt soldiers at Agra, as elsewhere, take disease from unregistered women, and however difficult it may be it is absolutely necessary, for the prevention of disease, to supervise these women. The Commis- sioner thinks the abolishment of the city inspection room is a retrograde step, likely to be attended with bad results. And he sympathizes with .the Municipal Committee, in their refusal to re-establish the room, for a purpose which militates against the prejudices of many of the members. The Commissioner remarks that; nothing is said, in the-report; as-to the registra- tion of a better class of women than. formerly. Although this is an important point, if the soldier is to restrict himself to registered women.
( 7 ) He concurs in the opinion that some good has been effected by lock hospitals, but thinks a great deal more remains to be done; if perfect efficiency is aimed at. And remarks that so much cannot be achieved, without increased expenditure, which should fall legitimately upon the Military Department. 4.( 8 ) avoiding her And, moreover, by handing the woman over to the police, the soldiers would. be acting in their own interests. For it is from this unlicensed class of women that soldiers chiefly contract disease, and then infect the registered women. The greater control of the soldiers, and the more vigilant management of the unregistered women of the place, are the chief points requiring attention. A more attractive class of women than now should be registered. The military police should prevent intercourse with unregistered women. The soldier should. be punished, for contracting disease, by having to perform extra duty after discharge from hospital. Many of the diseased soldiers enjoy the idleness of their hospital life, Com- fortable free quarters for the women are also recommended. This measure might induce more women to register themselves. In 1882 the ratio of registered women was only 4.6 per cent, of the soldiers: it should be 10.0 per cent. But the main difficulty to be overcome is the improvement of the soldier, so that he shall become a self-denying, temperate, careful man. The Medical Officer regrets that favourable results have not attended the efforts of the local authorities to check disease in 1882. 18. The Cantonment Committee, considering the report, resolve to forward it to the Lock Hospital Sub-Committee for further report. 19. The Sub-Committee report that no efforts have been wanting to check the increase of disease. And that until soldiers are punished for contracting disease, better results are not be expected. 20. The Cantonment Magistrate reports that the sub-committee assembled with great regularity, during the year, to watch the working of the rules and improve it where necessary. Thirteen women were apprehended for practising without a ticket. Nine of them were found diseased. There were three convictions for breach of rules. Two were punished by simple imprisonment of 15 and 8 days respectively;, one fined Rs. 4. 21. The Magistrate of the district notes the great increase of disease recorded, and considers it a startling contrast to previous better experience. The increased disease amongst the artillerymen is particularly surprising as, in Cawnpore, artil- lerymen were shown to be most free of any soldiers from disease, at a former period of the Magistrate's experience. For better results the soldier requires "control from within," that is, control of discipline and punishment. Until the soldier is punished for contracting disease, the best arrangements as regards the registered women will effect no good, In the city doubtless many women escape registration who ought to be registered, but it is difficult to prove that they have consorted with soldiers, and impossible to register all the city prostitutes. The chief evil, indeed, does not come from prostitutes at all, but from coolie women who hang about the barracks. Their exclusion is a matter of regi- mental police. The Magistrate thinks a better class of women cannot be registered because the. soldier cannot afford to pay the price such women can demand from other men. He thinks it difficult to acquiesce in. the suggestion, that Government should provide registered women with quarters. The falling off in the numbers of the registered women is proof that it does not pay prostitutes to encourage soldiers' visits, and that soldiers prefer the unregistered women. In addition to the three convictions reported by the Cantonment Magistrate, the district courts disposed of four cases. Nine women were brought on the register and fined Rs. 100. But the fines of two women were remitted by the Magistrate. 22. The Commissioner notes that the report tells a tale of failure greater than that of last year, notwithstanding the efforts of the authorities. Remedy appears to reside first in the greater control of the soldiers, second in the more vigilant management of unregistered women. The first is a matter for the consideration of the military authorities. The second, so far as the city is concerned,
( 9 ) is a matter for the consideration of the civil authorities. And the Commissioner thinks the city registration is inadequate. That all the women who reside there and receive the visits of soldiers could be pointed out and ought to be registered Yet with care to prevent the extraction of money from the upper ranks of prostitutes. However, the Commissioner believes no real progress will be made, and no suc- cessful results obtained, until the matter is inquired into, as a whole, by the com- mittee mentioned in para. 8 of the Government remarks upon the lock hospital report of 1881. 5.( 10 ) The powers of the Contagious Diseases Act should be extended to the city and bazaars. Soldiers might justly be punished for contracting disease. If the soldiers were occasionally inspected they could not conceal disease to escape punishment, or could be punished if found to have concealed it. Such measures might be effective to prevent excessive disease. And soldiers should not be admitted to the canteen for 14 days after discharge from hospital for venereal disease. In consideration of the extraordinary disease prevalence of the year of report, the Medical Officer thinks the strong measure of placing the city out of bounds perma- nently to the soldier should be enforced. The Sub-Committee assembled once a month throughout the year. The expen- diture for the year was less by Rs. 236-10-0 than in 1881( 11 ) the women, by frequent unexpected examination. Even at night time, in many cases, the registered women have been, roused from their beds for examination, so that it might be impossible for them to hide disease by the practice of ablution before exa- mination. And the women were examined every second day as a rule. Amongst the soldiers there was more disease than in 1881. This was due in some measure to the fact that one battery of artillery, which remained only 16 days in the station, provided seven cases of disease. The artillery encamped at Kicha for practice contracted less disease than usual, because registered women were sent to camp with them. Consort with unregistered women met upon the roads in the dusk is the great source of the soldiers' disease( 12 ) In regard to the complaint against the police, the Commissioner is of opinion that the duty of preventing unlicensed intercourse about barracks and cantonments per- tains solely to the regimental police. In regard to the punishment of the women, the Commissioner is of opinion that the reformatory proposal of the Cantonment Magistrate is untenable : its action would be illegal and entail great hardship. Further, the Cantonment Magistrate has recommended a more perfect observance of the regulation forbidding the employment of women for building purposes, or as sellers of milk or other articles, in the neighbourhood of barracks. In regard to this point the Commissioner records the opinion, that it is the Cantonment Magistrate's duty to ensure the proper observance of such rules. 7.( 13 ) 8.( 4 ) an enormous city. Ticca-garri hire is cheap, and a soldier can ride for four miles in any direction he pleases for two annas. The police can prevent the-lurking of suspicious characters on the outskirts of cantonments and prevent the residence of prostitutes in surrounding villages. But they cannot interfere with the carriage excursions of the soldiers. When decent houses and decent women have been provided, and unregistered, women are kept out of cantonments and its vicinity, the civil authorities have done, all they can do ; the rest remains in the hands of the military authorities. And disease prevalence will remain as now, unless the military authorities act energeti- cally, by punishing men who have contracted disease( 15 ) admissions for the year was only 19 per 1,000 of strength, against 385 per 1,000 amongst the European soldiers. The cause of the difference seems to be, that Native soldiers are careful as to the women with whom they consort. The attendance of the registered women for examination was regular. They were medically examined three times in every month. In all 62 cases of venereal disease were discovered amongst them, against 168 in 1881. In all 28 women were newly registered in the year, and of these 11 were found diseased on first examination. The. Native Doctor, Durga Singh, has given entire satisfaction. The Medical Officer is sorry to say not one of the recommendations made last year has been carried out. Again he recommends the erection of a suitable lock hospital building in cantonments, and the provision of places of residence for the registered women. At present these women live scattered in the city, and therefore. cannot be properly managed. 48. The Commanding Officer reports that instructions have been lately received from the military authorities for the submission of a proposal to hire a bungalow in cantonments for a lock hospital. But, unless a brothel for the women is also pro- vided, the soldiers will gain nothing by this change. The necessity which exists for the attendance of the City Magistrate at the monthly meetings of the Lock Hospital Sub-Committee has been brought to the notice of the Magistrate of the district. The lock hospital management is entirely in the hands of the civil authorities at Mora- dabad. 49. Thé Magistrate of the district remarks upon the unsatisfactory results, and thinks the high percentage of disease amongst the European soldiers, and the low percentage amongst the Native soldiers, remarkable as conicident circumstances. The City Magistrate has been directed to attend the monthly meetings of the Sub-Committee, and the police will be made to do their work in this matter. But the cantonment authorities should more carefully prevent the loitering of women about the barracks. The Magistrate forwards a memorandum upon this subject prepared by the City Magistrate. 50. The Commissioner notes the very unsatisfactory results. This may be due to the want of a properly situated lock hospital at Moradabad. But is more likely to be due to a want of cordiality of action between the Sub-Committee and the civil authorities. The first possible cause will be remedied when the proposed bungalow is occupied as a lock hospital in cantonments. But, a brothel for the women must be established if good results are to be expected. Without doubt disease is contracted by the soldiers from unregistered women( 16 ) The results of the management have been satisfactory. For the eight years, 1875-82, the ratios of admission to hospital for venereal disease, amongst the European garrison, have been 263, 224, 305, 333, 344, 345, 201, and 208 per 1,000 of daily average strength. 52. The Medical Officer reports that, up to date, the situation of the hospital is unchanged. But it has been decided to build a new lock hospital, to accommodate 20 patients, in a much more suitable situation. The medical charge of the hospital changed hands no less than six times during the year. The disease prevalence amongst the soldiers was about the same in 1882 and in 1881. But in 1882 the admissions to hospital for venereal were increased by the fact that a regiment, on march to Peshawar, left their sick in the Sháhjahánpur hospital. Of the 77 cases admitted during the year, 16 were not contracted at Shájahánpur. . The registered women were examined weekly with great carefulness, and oftener if suspicion of disease arose. They had less disease than in 1881. Sixteen unregis- tered women, brought for examination, were all found badly diseased. 53. The Magistrate of the district notes the satisfactory results, quoting the figures in support of that opinion. 54. The Commissioner notes that fines realized, during the year, were credited to a special fund for adding to the comfort of women in hospital. He thinks the result of the management are on the whole satisfactory, quoting the necessary figures. But believes the frequent change of Medical Officer cannot have been to the advantage of the hospital. 11.( 17 ) If the soldier could be punished for contracting disease from an unregistered woman by stoppoge of pay during stay in hospital and extra guard duty afterwards, a considerable good effect would result( 18 ) The Medical Officer's report that 24 unregistered women were arrested is incor rect. Only one was arrested and sentenced to imprisonment, and she was not regis tered after release. 62. The Deputy Commissioner of the district remarks, that the ratio of disease amongst the soldiers fell to an extraordinary extent in 1882, as compared with 1881. Notwithstanding an increase of garrison, the demand for the services of registered women decreased, and their numbers lessened monthly, until at the end of the year they were fewer by one-third than at the beginning. Upon this point the Cantonment Magistrate reports as above. It is of course impossible to prevent the departure of women without notice, and it seems unnecessary to trace them out. As touching upon the point of the possible advantage of registering only attrac- tive women, the Deputy Commissioner remarks, that during the year of report a registered woman, on account of age and ailments other than venereal, was removed from the register. But to her prostitution meant livelihood, and she refused to leave cantonments. To deal with such cases it seems necessary that, after report from the Medical Officer, and revoking of the license, the Cantonment Magistrate should com- pel the women to leave cantonments. The results show a vastly improved management in 1882. 63. The Commissioner notes the very satisfactory results. Not only was disease less, but its type was milder. The ratio of disease amongst the registered women seems high, and points to the conclusion that they are too few. And the Commissioner observes that, whereas the return records the registration of only 24 new women, the Cantonment Magistrate puts the number at 32. The discrepancy will be inquired into. 13.ROORKEE. 64. During the year 1882 a monthly average of 28 women remained on the register, against 34 in 1881. The results of the management have been very unsatisfactory. For the nine years, 1874-82, the ratios of admissions to hospital for venereal disease, amongst the European garrison, have been 198, 146, 124, 66, 262, 132, 178, 177, and 307 per 1,000 of daily average strength. 65. The Medical Officer reports that a new lock hospital building has been sanctioned ; plan, estimate, and site settled. But, during the year of report, the old hospital was occupied at a rental of Rs. 8 per mensem. The registered women were examined twice a week during the early part of the year afterwards only once. No disease could escape detection, and all cases of disease were effectually cured in hospital. Several of the women were accused of having caused disease, but not in a single instance did the result of examination uphold the accusation. The soldiers, without doubt, contracted their diseases from unregistered coolie women outside the station. As an especial measure of protection, a registered woman visited by a soldier is examined by the matron before consort is permitted. If found healthy the woman's ticket is shown to the soldier. If found unhealthy the ticket is withheld, and the soldier warned against the possible con- sequence of consort. There were only 28 registered women in 1882, against 34 in 1881 An additional matron was employed during the year. A total of 84 cases of disease occurred amongst the women, 64 of which were venereal. The usual of management was carefully carried out ; the hospital was carefully guarded, so that no woman could leave it without permission. Since the report was written orders have been received, from Government, for- bidding the construction of the proposed new hospital.
( 19 ) 66. The Cantonment Magistrate offers the remark that the Medical Officer's opinion as to the source of the soldier's disease is correct, The rules were carefully carried out with satisfactory results. Three registered women were punished by fines, aggregating Rs. 7, for the offence of removing their names from the register and yet continuing their business of prostitution at Roorkee. 67. The Magistrate of the district summarises the report, quoting necessary facts and figures. He cannot agree with the Cantonment Magistrate in thinking the results satis- factory ; for the ratio of disease amongst the soldiers was as high as 302 per 1,000 of daily average strengh. Judged by this only efficient test, the result was deplorable, when compared with the better results of previous years. The unsuitable situation of the hospital is generally admitted. But if access to it is carefully prevented, the position of the hospital, within the bazaar, is a matter of minor consideration. The cause of failure here Must be looked for in another direction. Probably failure was due to two causes, the insufficient number of registered women, and the consort of soldiers with unregistered women. It may be that the registered women were unattractive. It is certain they numbered only 23 of available average, whilst 40 appears to be the average which should have existed. It is quite impossible that direct steps should be taken to increase the number of registered women. Registration involves many annoyances and doubtless pecuniary loss. These annoyances may be inevitable, and as a set off against them, it might be advantageous to allow the women rent-free quarters. Experience shows conclusively that soldiers do consort with unregistered women, and so contract loathsome disease, notwithstanding the offer to them of women able to satisfy their desires with safety. And the reason for this has yet to be discovered. Its discovery merits careful consideration on the part of military authorities. Possibly the present system fails, by reason of its elimination, of all romantic element, from the business of inter- course. If the reasons were known( 20 ) 70. The Medical Officer reports that the hospital accommodation remained as in 1881. But the hospital assistant is to reside at the Gurkha hospital, and his .former quarters are to be given to the servants of the lock hospital as a place of residence. The medical charge changed hands four times during the year. The hospital assistant gives every satisfaction. On arrival from the plains 16 soldiers were admitted into hospital with venereal disease, and 68 cases were contracted at Naini Tal( 21 ) The regimental police system, for preventing unlicensed intercourse, has been strictly carried out. No women offenders were arrested. The women were regular in their attendance for examination. One absentee was fined Re. 1, and one struck off the register. The examinations were effected weekly. The womens' diseases were of mild type. 74. The Deputy Commissioner of the district notes the extremely satisfactory results, and this notwithstanding the unfavourable nature of the locality( 22 ) The results of the manngement have been very unsatisfactory. For the nine years, 1874-82, the ratios of admissions to hospital for venereal disease, amongst the Euro- pean garrison, have been 59, 58, 112, 98, 162, 202, 64, 290, and 367 per 1,000 of daily average strength. 81 The Medical Officer reports that no steps. have been taken to improve the locality or accommodation of the hospital, so forcibly denounced last year. The medical charge changed hands three times during the year. The venereal returns have been regularly received. The Sub-Committee assembled monthly while the troops remained at the station. The registered women were examined weekly at least. A matron has been em- ployed, and the dispensary native doctor has attended for the treatment of diseased women, but has received no extra pay for this duty, although entitled to Rs. 10 per mensem for it. The registered women were more in nnmber and their diseases more than in 1881. Some of these diseases were of very virulent character. And one woman more espe- cially has bad prolonged disease, due in some measure to the insanitary conditions of the hospital. The Medical Officer strongly advises the building of a new hospital. The exist- ing accommodation consists of one ill-ventilated ward. Venereal disease at Chakráta is very virulent in character, certainly more virulent than in the plains. The diseased soldiers have suffered severely. Secondary disease has in some cases quickly followed the primary affection, making the men unfit for duty for a long time. 82. The Cantonment Magistrate reports that the results have been most unsa- tisfactory. For the realization of improved results, he recommends an increase to the number of registered women, who should be young, and provided with suitable accom- modation at the expense of Government. Then they could be properly supervised. As things now are, the soldiers leave their palatial quarters, to visit a totally inade- quate number of women residing in filthy dens, and thus court disease. Further, he urges a more efficient regimental control and discipline in regard to the prevention of illicit intercourse. The entry into the lines of native women cooks, soldiers' ayahs, or female work-people should be strictly forbidden. And power should be given, to the Commanding Officer, to banish from Cantonment all women reasonably suspected to be of evil repute. The Cantonment Magistrate grants that to add to the number of registered women will be a difficult matter because prostitutes of the plains dislike hill residence as being expensive, the climate too cold, the general population too scanty. Perhaps the grant of free quarters might attract them, perhaps the employment of an ener- getic procuress might be helpful in this direction. Certainly a better hospital should be provided, the existing accommodation being justly describable as disgraceful. A site and plan were provided ; estimates were submitted for a new building. But the scheme fell through under the operation of Government of India order No. 772S.-C., in the Military Department, dated 25th August, 1882, which ruled that no outlay would be sanctioned for lock hospital buildings. In view of this order, the Commander-in-Chief desired the improvement of the existing accommodation, or the hiring of a new house. Measures found to be impracticable, as reported by the Commanding Officer( 23 ) but owing to the considerable number of patients, the expenses for diet have far exceeded the estimate. The excess, disallowed by the paymaster, has been paid from the Cantonment Fund, and the fact reported for the information of the Commander­in- Chief. 18.( 24 ) some women sent up for punishment were acquitted. This naturally weakened the efficient working of the rules. Indeed, the cantonment authorities have been work- ing on rules published in the North-Western Provinces Gazette of 15th August, 1866, which however were superseded by rules materially different, published in the North-Western Provinces Gazette of 10th October, 1866. In the Magistrate's opinion disease is contracted from women who find their way to the neighbourhood of cantonments. And, well knowing the soldiers' favourite walks, meet them thereon. For the soldiers are allowed to go out for long distances, so it is next to impossible to check this evil. Considering the success achieved, the Magistrate sees no cause for complaint with the management. The expense of a brothel, in the sadr bazaar, would fall upon the Cantonment Committee, whose financial position prevents the entertainment of such a question. 88. The Commissioner is of opinion that the management has been satisfactory. But remarks, for the third time, upon the impropriety of giving the medical charge to a Hospital assistant, when it should be held at least by a Surgeon. The Magistrate evidently desires to give every possible help towards good manage- ment, but it is unreasonable to expect the municipality to bear the cost of a brothel in the sadr bazaar. SECTION II. RECORD OF GENERAL RESULTS. 89. During the year 1882, a monthly average of 1,087 women remained on the registers. For the five years 1878-82, the averages have been 1,350, 1,286, 1,152, 1,145, and 1,087. The figures witness to a continuous decline in the all-important element of suc- cess( 25 ) long as they live in recognized abodes, always under control, and open only to the advances of soldiers. As the result of last year's report, a justifiable hope was raised that collected, rent-free, abodes would be provided for the women. From several stations it was recommended, and the local Government encouraged this view. But its realization was entirely overthrown by the order of the Government of India in the Military Department, No. 772S./C., dated 25th August, 1882. To the effect, that " it had been decided to allow the continuance of the lock hospital system, upon the understanding that no more outlay is to be incurred in the construction of buildings for such institutions." As the provision of rent-free quarters must necessitate a reasonable expenditure, I need scarcely say that all expectation of getting them for the women( 26 ) recorded, favouring the belief that the endeavour is unworthy of encouragement( 27 ) At Cawnpore, it is reported (para. 7) that much of the good result recorded arose, out of the good work done by the police( 28 ) cantonments. This disease was contracted from women met in the roads, nálas, and park of the neighbourhood. Afterwards these soldiers imparted disease to the registered women. At Naini Tal, it is reported (para. 70) that the excessive disease was contracted, chiefly, from unregistered coolie women met by the soldiers in their walks ( 29 ) is carried to the stations. Mark the records of any hill station, in regard to venereal prevalence. Year after year the evil increases. Until now in 1882, we have, for Rani- khet a ratio of 378.5, against 153.0 before lock hospitals were opened. And for Chak­ ráta a ratio of 366.6 against 142.0. It is not likely that the women of the hills were absent when the soldiers first arrived. At Sitapur (para. 60) appears the record, that fully a third of all the soldiers disease of the year is admitted in one month. In explanation, it appears, that this arose out of the coming from England of a new regiment, the men of which brought disease, chiefly contracted at Deolali and on the line of march. At Naini Tal it appears (para. 70) that out of 286 men who joined the depôt at the commencement of the season, 16 came with veneral disease established. 104. Experience has shown that until, of a certainty, soldiers can be hindered from taking disease from the unregistered women of the country, and the registered women can be hindered from taking disease from the native men of the country, the lock hospital scheme cannot prosper. A certain and very real amount of good, has resulted from the expenditure entailed, in that a vast amount of venereal disease amongst the women has been cured. But apparently no appreciable good has resulted as regards the prevention of disease amongst the soldiers. It is for Government to determine whether under these circumstances the expenditure involved should con- ­tinue. Already the order has gone forth forbidding the provision of absolutely neces- ­sary accommodation. Under these circumstances it seems reasonable to suppose that the best course would be to abandon the scheme altogether. And to make the Com- ­manding Officer, and the Medical Officer, of the regiment responsible for the preven- ­tion of excessive venereal disease amongst the soldiers, as in the days before the lock hospitals were opened. 105. The measures recommended for the improved working of the scheme in the reports of the year 1882 may be summed up as follows :( 30 ) mittee be appointed, I shall be very glad to aid,. to the best of my ability, its arrival at a just comprehension of all that has gone before in regard to this subject( 31 ) Funds, and Rs. 25,184-2-10 from Cantonment Funds. It therefore appears that the total of expenditure was less by Rs. 270-9-3 in 1882. The very considerable decrease in the share paid from Imperial Funds, in 1882, arose out of the fact, that the total expenditure, at Cawnpore and Jhánsi, was met from Cantonment Funds in that year. 111. The average cost of each woman registered, of each woman examined, and of each case of disease treated, was greater in every instance in 1882. So long as the number of women continues to decrease the average cost is likely to increase. The largest averages are at Benares ; and in view of the figures recorded against that sta- tion in form III,, it seems doubtful whether in justice it ought not to change places with Ranikhet on the class list. 112.

Form I.( 2 ) considerable decrease in the number of registered women; indeed, only 72 women remained on the register at the end of the year( 3 ) 5. The Magistrate of the district submits the report, with the remark, that a most satisfactory diminution of disease amongst the soldiers has characterized the year's management( 4 ) At the end of the year only 82 names remained on the register, against 100 at the beginning of the year. The decrease being almost entirely due to the large number of city women who have taken their names off the register, on pretence of marriage. The registered women attended regularly for examination; most cases of absence arose out of illness. Amongst the women disease decreased in most satisfactory manner in 1883. For the three years 1881-83 the admissions have been 273, 160 and 122. And of these 122 admissions to hospital in 1883, only 54 were on account of venereal disease, and that disease of very mild type. The hospital expenditure in 1883 was less by Rs. 1,100 than in 1882. The Medical Officer again recommends the grant of free quarters to the women. Now they are very badly housed at exorbitant rents, for the payment of which, two or even three women are obliged to share one house, in many cases a positively indecent arrangement. A panchayat, assembled to enquire into this circumstance, reported that the women paid treble the proper rent for their rooms, yet the owners could not be in- duced to lower the rents. And the Medical Officer hopes the efforts of the committee, in the direction of purchasing houses for the women, will be successful. 9. The Cantonment Committee consider the results of the management very satisfactory, and recommend the provision of free quarters for the women, as soon as funds are available. Of the 10 houses now occupied, for only 5 is the rent higher than that assessed by the panchayat. 10. The Magistrate of the district forwards the report, with expression of satis- faction at the results recorded. He notes the activity of the police in preventing the presence of unregistered women near to the barracks, and records the opinion that disease is chiefly contracted from that class of women. With reference to the difficulty of registering city women, and the facilities the registered women have for taking their names off the register, the Magistrate explains that until it can be proved that a city woman receives soldiers' visits she is not liable to registration, and that if evidence of marriage is tendered, it is almost impossible to prevent the removal of the name of the woman concerned. Enquiry will be made in regard to the circumstan- ces of women who removed their names last year. But it seems worthy of satisfac- tory notice, that the diminution in the number of registered women has been coincident with a diminution of disease. 11. The Commissioner summarises the results, which he considers very satisfactory. And notes that more than 50 per cent. of the disease recorded amongst the soldiers happened when they were out in camp( 5 ) 13. The Medical Officer reports favourably as regards the hospital accommodation. Water-supply, sanitation, and ventilation have been well cared for during the past year. Three separate Medical Officers have held charge of the hospital at different periods of the year. Amongst the European troops there has been a considerable increase of venereal disease, as compared with the prevalence of 1882. And of this disease the largest pro- portion must have been contracted from unlicensed women: for of 145 instances in which the registered women were reported by soldiers as having communicated disease, in only 24 could disease be detected in the accused woman. The sub-committee assembled monthly for the transaction of business. The efforts made to check unlicensed prostitution met with little success. A military police, consisting of from 14 to 18 soldiers, gave little assistance in preventing it, or in arrest- ing the offending women, who do not live in the cantonment bazars, but lurk about the outskirts of cantonments and the neighbourhood of the fort and city. Of the esti- mated total of 1,000 prostitutes living in Agra city, only 46 were registered, and amongst these 46 women, as many as 64 cases of venereal complaint were treated in the year. It may therefore be assumed that a large number of the unregistered women must be diseased. Of 38 unregistered women arrested during the year, 34 were found to be diseased. The cantonment registered women have been fairly regular in their attendance for examination. But the city registered women were most irregular, as many as 691 cases of absence from the weekly inspections having been reported. Amongst the registered women, there was increase of disease amongst those registered in the city, but the cantonment women had less disease than last year. The Medical Officer thinks the amount of venereal disease amongst the soldiers at Agra might diminish if the registration included more city women, and he strongly recommends action in that direction. The city inspection-house was given up at the commencement of 1883, and now all registered women of the city come to the lock hospital in cantonments for examination. During the year of report the cantonment registered women have been provided with suitable quarters in the sadr and regimental bazars. 14. The Cantonment Magistrate reports that the returns for the past year compare very unfavourably with those for 1882, and of the 370 cases of disease which occurred amongst the soldiers 42 per cent. were cases of syphilis. This excessive prevalence of disease may have been due, in some measure, to the arrival of a new regiment, the men of which provided 45 cases of disease in the first month of their arrival. Also in the last three months of the year disease was un- usually prevalent, and at that period several thousands of rupees, in re-engagement boun- ty, were distributed amongst the soldiers. The Cantonment Committee think some of the money may have been utilized to procure intercourse with unregistered women, who caused the disease which prevailed. During the months of November and December, special police were employed for the prevention of this illicit intercourse, and 36 unlicensed women were arrested. Upon examination, 33 were found diseased. Thirty of these women were punished by imprisonment for eight days each. There can be no doubt that the serious prevalence of disease reported was due to intercourse with unregistered women: for amongst the registered women there was less disease in 1883 than in 1882. The special police force has done much to check this illicit prostitution and the maintenance of that force is advisable. 2
( 6 ) In compliance with suggestions received from the Quarter-Master-General's De- partment (Circular No. 7, dated 14th February, 1883), suitable accommodation has been provided, at the expense of the cantonment funds, for 27 registered women in the sadr bazar, and 33 registered women in the European Infantry bazar. In each case the accommodation consists of a walled enclosure with one entrance. In this enclosure each woman has a separate well-ventilated quarter 13 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 10 feet high; general Cook-rooms, ablution-rooms, dry-earth latrines and urinals, are pro- vided in both places. The cost to date has been Rs. 3,000, and only a small further grant will be required. Sanction has been asked for the entertainment of a bhisti and sweeper for each block, and the committee hope that all these advantages will result in the registration of a better class of women. 15. The Magistrate of the district records his regret for the large increase of venereal disease which has distinguished the year, but is not surprised at its occur- rence, in view of the causes for it reported by the Cantonment Magistrate. To these causes the Magistrate would add another( 7 ) In Meerut the locality of infection is thus recorded :( 8 ) a rule they were cases of freshly contracted disease. (Yet the Medical Officer has deducted all these cases, together with all the cases contracted at the placés named other than Meerut, from the total of admissions to hospital recorded, and from the figures of remainder, contrasted with the mean strength, calculates that the ratio of admissions to hospital for the year was 82·77 per 1,000 ; and, judged by this stand- ard, he thinks the result of the mangement is most satisfactory, which it no doubt is. But for comparison with the results in other stations, it is absolutely necessary to calculate the ratio of prevalence from the figures of actual admissions and of daily average strength for the 365 days of the year. So calculated( 9 ) This indicates the large amount of disease which exists among the unregistered class of prostitutes. Amongst the registered women there was less disease than in 1882, but as regards syphilis the prevalence was equal in both years. The medical exami- nations were effected twice in every week. The attendance has been generally good. Amongst the soldiers there was very much less disease than in 1882, the admissions to hospital having been 394, for comparison with 772 in 1882. Indeed, there was much less disease in 1883 than is usual at Lucknow. In 1883 disease was more prevalent amongst the artillery and cavalry than amongst the infantry, but no reason can be given for this. The men of all corps and drafts on arrival in the station are at once medically inspected. Regimental police are instructed to prevent the entrance of unregistered prostitutes to the lines, but owing to the extent of cantonments it is difficult to effect this. The native police do all in their powerto prevent the consort of soldiers with unregistered women, but they cannot interfere outside cantonments, and so do not effect much good. The Medical Officer is of opinion that, until the Contagious Diseases Act is enforc- ed. in the city and bazars, much reduction in the venereal prevalence should not be expected. During the year, owing to the prevalence of small-pox and for other reasons, the city was placed out of bounds to the soldier for a longer period than usual, the orders being more strictly carried out than usual. To this much of the decrease of disease is attributable. And the Medical Officer would again suggest that the city and all bazars out of cantonments should be permanently placed out of bounds. The result, he believes, would be most favourable. He also suggests that the rule which forbids entry to the canteen, to a soldier, for 14 days after his discharge from hospi- tal cured of venereal disease, should be strictly enforced. For many of the admissions to hospital are due to relapses of gonorrh( 10 ) forbidden. to go down the Mall road into the Residency, or into the Machi Bhawan; or the Wingfield Park. Certainly they think the lock hospital rules should be enforced for a certain distance outside the cantonment limits. 29.The Commissioner thinks that of the remedies, (1) to bring under the operation of the Act a larger area( 11 ) 33. The Commissioner remarks that the sub-committee assembled monthly 70 supervise the working of the rules. But no record is before the Commissioner to show what recommendations were made by the committee, or that the Medical Offi- cer's annual report has been scrutinized by its members. The summary, closing that report, is rather an essay on the benefits of the system, than a report on the working of the hospital. On the whole, the working of the hospital has been satisfactory. And it is satisfactory to find, from the Magistrate's report, that there has been less disease in 1883, than in any of the last five years. And both the Magistrate and the Surgeon in charge agree as regards the aid given by the police to the prevention of unlicensed prostitution.* 7.( 12 ) women more attractive than those registered : consequently they suffered very much from venereal affection. The great difficulty has been, to prevent a continuance of the disease, from the soldier's consort with unregistered women. The Medical Officer has no reason to believe that the registered women contracted disease except from soldiers, at all events the half of them who live in cantonments. 36. The Cantonment Magistrate agrees with the Medical Officer that a good deal of venereal disease was imported to the station by in-coming regiments. In addition to those mentioned in the report, several cases were brought in by the regiment which returned from Lucknow at the beginning of the year. Some soldiers have stated that they had contracted disease from women met during shooting excursions or walks. The police were ordered to search for and ap- prehend such women offenders. Nine were convicted and registered. The native police cannot be charged with the entire prevention of intercourse between soldiers and unregistered women, or to do more than prevent public solicitation, and this they seem to do. If illicit intercourse is carried on in the immediate vicinity of cantonments as alleged, the regimental police ought to be able to apprehend the women con- cerned. 37. The Colonel Commanding at Fyzabad remarks that the police are not keen enough in detecting unregistered women offenders. For reports are constantly received to the effect that soldiers contract disease from these women, who are picked up all round cantonments. Yet very few of them are caught and punished. And the Colo- nel would recommend that dhais should be provided, to act as spies, and hunt down these unregistered women. The Colonel thinks the working of the system, as it now exists, is most creditable to all the officers concerned. 38. The Deputy Commissioner of the district would be sorry to see the police directed to make more use of their inquisitional powers than they already do, and thinks the recommendation of the Colonel Commanding might be given a trial. 39. The Commissioner records the opinion that, as in Lucknow and elsewhere, so in Fyzabad, the difficulty to overcome, is the prevention of the soldier's association with unregistered women. He agrees with the Deputy Commissioner in thinking that the recommendation of the Colonel Commanding might be tried as an experiment, and remarks that the officers charged with carrying out the present system have done their duty well. 8.( 13 ) There was little disease amongst the soldiers, and that of mild type ; also very few cases of secondary syphilis occurred. At the musketry camp far less disease, than usual, was contracted in 1883, because of more stringent regime( 14 ) soldiers affected by disease in 1882, and in 1883, was the same. This seems to prove that the soldiers' diseases are contracted, as often from registered, as from unre- gistered women. Although the visits of native men to the registered women should be forbid- den, every registered woman should be allowed access to her fancy-man, or she will not keep her name on the register. The good results of the year's management are mainly attributable to the stringent measures taken to prevent the visits of native men to the registered women. And to this stringency, the decrease in the number of registered women may also be attributed. The failure, in regard to the expected gain from a grant of rent-free quarters, has been due to the fact that access to native men is forbidden there. Therefore the registered women refuse to live there. The Magis- trate commends the dhai plan of management recommended by the Cantonment Ma- gistrate. 45. The Commissioner submits the report with the remark, that the results have been satisfactory. He is at a loss to understand why the provision of rent-free quar- ters proved a failure. At Fyzabad the plan worked well. The failure at Benares may be attributed to the mistaken arrangement, of making the houses to open into one common yard. Each house should have been detached, with a separate yard and entrance. There is, probably, truth in the statement, that most of the soldier's disease comes from the registered women. But the Commissioner can testify to the fact, that soldiers at Benares still patronize coolie-women who hang about the outskirts of cantonments. It is probably impossible to secure the services of a good class of women willing to reserve themselves for soldiers only, for the soldiers cannot meet the just expecta- tions of such women in regard to payment. The Commissioner thinks the expendi- ture at the Benares lock hospital is, altogether, disproportionate to the record of work performed there. 9.( 15 ) 10.( 16 ) paper tickets now given to the registered women, which soon become soiled and use- less, the Medical Officer recommends the issue of small cards secured and protected in leathern bags( 17 ) 61. The Station Staff Officer, forwards the report, which has not apparently been submitted to the Deputy Commissioner, or to the Commissioner. 13.( 18 ) 67. The Medical Officer reports that the hospital accommodation consists of one large ward accommodating 12 patients, one end of the ward being screened off to form an inspection-room. The greatest number of patients at one time has been 5. The medical charge has passed into the hands of four different Medical Officers during the year, but the permanent medical subordinate has been efficient. The monthly average of soldiers for the year has been 254. The greatest number at any one time, 400. Six soldiers arrived from the plains already diseased, and 70 cases of disease were contracted at Naini Tal. The soldiers concerned generally stated that they had contracted disease from unregistered women, numbers of whom frequent the neighbourhood and are not controlled in any way, Though the European and native police are instructed to report any woman employed in the business of prostitution without registration. The attendance of the registered women for examination has been good. Forty- six cases of disease were discovered amongst them, of which 15 were venereal. There was decided comparative decrease of disease amongst the soldiers and the registered women in 1883. But the Medical Officer cannot offer an opinion, as to the efficiency of the management to control the spread of venereal disease in Naini Tal. 68. The Officer Commanding countersigns the report without remark. 69. The Commissioner forwards the report for disposal. 15 .( 19 ) 16.( 20 ) regiment was present. But when a detachment only was present they were examined only twice a month. The women have been regular in attendance for examination. The Native Doctor of the dispensary has been employed at the lock hospital without extra pay. The sub-committee referred the question to the Quarter Master General( 21 ) Amongst the soldiers there was increase of disease in 1883, as compared with 1882. In most instances they stated that disease had been contracted from unregistered women, met after dark in ravines. Some registered women were accused of causing disease, and taken at once to the station hospital for examination. Not one of them was found diseased. The Medical Officer again recommends the establishment of a brothel in the sadr bazar, and urges that the police should be more vigilant to catch the unregistered women Who prowl after dark in the ravines. That the registered women should be obliged to present themselves regularly for weekly examinations. That the number of registered women should be increased. During the year of report, the Magistrate ordered the removal from the register of 15 women's names, on the grounds that they had ceased to be prostitutes, or had become mistresses, or had changed their places of residence to beyond the recognized area of lock hospital management. 83. The Cantonment Committee are of opinion that the working of the lock hospi- tal for 1883 was satisfactory, but consider that a stricter registration of the prosti- tutes would lead to even better results. It is believed that many prostitutes get their names taken off the register on plea of giving up prostitution with soldiers, and yet continue that business. 84. The Commanding Officer thinks the lock hospital building is not sufficiently enclosed to prevent the patients going out when they like. With reference to the objection taken by the Commissioner to the holding of the medical charge by a hospital assistant( 22 ) to virtue. Assuming that number to be one-third of the total strength, it follows that, as the scheme worked in 1883, it provided one woman for the requirements of 8 or 9 men( 23 ) 91. During the year of report very little has been done to improve the lock hospital accommodation at Chakráta, Roorkee, or Allahabad( 24 ) 94. Disease prevalence amongst the women in 1883 was decidedly less than it has been for some years past. Compared with the results for 1882, the following figures appear for consideration:( 25 ) From Sháhjahánpur (paragraph 52)( 26 ) Taking the cases of failure first( 27 ) that is so, it seems reasonable to conclude that the registered women should be nu- merous, and fairly attractive( 28 ) year. It seems just that the Native Doctor should be paid as desired, more especially as the paid services of a Native Doctor are allowed in 15 other lock hospitals. 104. At Fatehgarh it is recommended that a recognized place of residence for the registered women should be established. And there cannot be a doubt that a cluster of village-like huts, conveniently situated, should be provided for this purpose. Also the necessity, of providing a hospital inclosure wall, is proved at paragraph 84. 105. The recommendations described in paragraphs 97 to 102 are the features of the report which require the attention and decision of the Government. And it can- not but be right, to ask attention to the extremely favourable record of paragraph 2, in regard to the conduct and abilities of Hospital Assistant Hira Lal. And to the favour- able record of paragraph 31, in regard to Native Doctor Karim Baksh. 106. The expenditure on account of lock hospitals for the year 1883 is shown in the appendix, Forms Nos. II. and III. And it appears that a sum of Rs. 4,203-2-0 was expended from Imperial funds, and Rs. 26,892-9-0 from Cantonment funds. Total Rs. 31,095-11-0; In 1882, the total expenditure was Rs. 35,583-5-1. Of which Rs. 6,898-15-4 was drawn from Imperial funds, and Rs. 28,684-5-9 from Cantonment funds. The figures therefore warrant a report that, for 1883, there was the considerable decrease in expenditure of Rs. 4,487-10-1. The decrease of expenditure from Imperial funds is most commendable, as there cannot be a doubt that the Cantonment authorities are more likely to give heed to the management, When the ,provision of the necessary funds falls to their lot. The Benares and Naini Tal lock hospitals are the only institutions of this class wholly supported by Government. And at Benares the average expenditure for each woman registered was Rs. 67-8-2( 29 ) amongst the soldiers and the registered women. So that secondary results are, it appears, by consensus of opinion, becoming rare in this province(30) No. 1.( 31 ) II.- Annual return of expenditure incurred in the Lock Hospitals of the North-Western Provinces and Ouch, for the year 1883.

The Lieutenant-Governor and Chief Commissioner is pleased to be able to observe that the administration of those rules during the year 1883 has been unattended with any instances of hardship or oppression, has called forth no complaints, and has not in itself incurred for them any general unpopularity.
