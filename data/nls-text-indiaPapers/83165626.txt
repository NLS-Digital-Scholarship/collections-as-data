No. 3881. Office OF THE Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Assam, Shillong. Dated Shillong, the 5th May 1934. From To Colonel J. P. CAMERON, C.S.I., C.I.E., V.H.S., I.M.S., INSPECTOR-GENERAL OF CIVIL. HOSPITALS, ASSAM, THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OP ASSAM, TRANSFERREP DEPARTMENTS. Sir, I have the honour to submit my Annual Report on the working of the Assam Mental Hospital, Tezpur, for the year 1933. Lieut.-Colonel H. L. Batra, m.c, i.m.s., was in charge of the Provincial Mental Hospital at Tezpur from the 1st to the 23rd January introductory. 1933 and Br ^ N&lt; 0howdhury&gt; A.MS. (Senior), from the 21th January to the end of the year. Dr. Chowdhury underwent special training for 6 months at the Ranchi Mental Hospital prior to assuming charge as whole-time Medical Superintendent of the Tezpur Mental Hospital. The Civil Surgeon, Darrang, now acts as consultant to the Hospital. Khan Sahib Dr. Mokhtar Hussain, Sub-Assistant Surgeon, held charge as Deputy Superintendent throughout the year. The general staff remained the same as in 1932, except that the temporary establishment of 6 male and 2 female keepers was made permanent and 2 more female keepers were entertained during the year under report. The appointment of an Assistant Matron was sanctioned during the year, and a suitable candidate has since been entertained. 2. The number of inmates remaining at the end of the year 1932 was G28, of .&laquo;,.-.'. whom 523 were males and 105 females. During the year Statement No. 1, Admission. ^^ ^.^ ^ patiQnts (134 mftles and l9 females) were admitted, including 8 re-admissions, all of whom were males.

Thirty-nine cases were admitted during the year, including 3 re-admissions, and 2 cases were carried forward from the previous year.
Of these 41, 26 were certified insane and admitted for safe custody and treatment, 1 was certified and released under section 14 of the Indian Lunacy Act IV of 1912, 7 were released as uncertifiable and 7 remained under observation at the end of the year. 7.

Of this number, 19 were discharged and 2 died leaving 255 at the end of the year. The daily average strength was 250*76 against 234-38 in 1932. Statement 1N0. IllReligion, Sex and Residences. 8. Out of a total of 145 new admissions classified by religion, 115 were Hindus, 17 Mohammedans, 5 Indian Christians and 8 of other castes. Of these, 85 were natives of the province and 60 natives of other provinces ; but most of the latter were domiciled. Statement occupation. No. ivPrevious & Cultivators and tea garden coolies furnished the largest number of admissions. 10. As usual the majority of cases on admission were found to be between 20 and 40 years of age. 11.

Total 293 29! 245
3 (c) The statement below shows the percentage of inmates admitted in good, indifferent and bad health during the past three years :4 The principal item of expenditure was the cost of " Diet" which amounted to Rs. 40,985-13-0, against Rs. 48,658-12-9 in 1932. The average cost per head was Rs. 62-15-5, against Rs. 79-13-4 in 1932. The decrease was due to the fall in prices of dietary articles. The receipts from paying patients were Rs. 1,232-9-0, against Rs. 1,116-8-0 in 1932. MISCELLANEOUS. Employment of patients. 15. (a) Male patients are employed on cultivation of vegetables and sugar- cane, manufacture of gur, jute, fencing of garden land, cane and bamboo works, carpentry, masonry and the usual domestic services. Females are employed on paddy husking, preparation of spices, mending clothes and other household works. Weaving is done by both male and female patients. Special methods of treatment. (b) The special methods of treatment adopted were5 Buildings. 16. There is no special accommodation for lepers, and a separate ward in each of the male and female enclosures is required for segre- gating such cases, providing accommodation for 10 male and 5 female inmates. General remarks. 17. The health of the inmates was satisfactory during the year and the sick and mortality rates compare favourably with those of the previous year. The usual prophylactic measures were adopted against Small-pox, Dysentery and Cholera. The Superintendent has again put forward proposals for additional establish- ment. One temporary clerk has been sanctioned recently, but the request for additional keepers (10 males and 3 females) has not been sanctioned. To avoid recourse to mechanical restraint it is essential for this additional establishment to be provided. The Institution was successfully managed during the year by Dr. Chowdhury and his staff, and the health statistics go to show that the medical supervision was very satisfactory. I am disappointed, however, in the garden and manufactory profits which I had hoped would be considerably increased under a whole-time Superintendent. This is under further investigation. Khan Sahib Dr. Mukhtar Hussain continued to take a keen interest in his work as Deputy Superintendent ; and I am indebted to the Civil Surgeon, Darrang, for his services as Consultant to the Institution.

To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF ASSAM, TRANSFERRED DEPARTMENTS. Dated Shillong, the 11th April 1936. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit my Annual Report on the working of the Assam Mental Hospital, Tezpur, for the year 1935. Introductory. Dr. S. N. Choudhury, A.M.S. (Senior) held charge of the Provincial Mental Hospital at Tezpur throughout the year. The Civil Surgeon, Darrang, acts as consultant to the Hospital. Khan Sahib Dr. Mokhtar Hussain, Selection Grade Sub-Assistant Surgeon, was the Deputy Superintendent throughout the year. The general staff remained the same as in 1934. Statement No. I. 2. The number of inmates remaining at the end of the year 1934 was 685 of whom 560 were males and 125 females. During the year under review 172 patients (153 males and 19 females) were admitted including 9 re-admissions (all males). The total number of patients treated during the year was, therefore, 857 (713 males and 144 females) as against 841 (697 males and 144 females) in 1934. Of this number, 69 were discharged " cured ", 12 discharged " Improved " 8 discharged " Not improved ", 4 discharged " Otherwise " and 91 died leaving 673 at the end of the year. The percentage of recoveries calculated on the daily average strength was 10.24 against 17.60 in 1934. Re-admission. 3. There were 9 re-admissions agaist 21 of the previous year. The interval from the date of discharge varied from 3 months 12 days to 14 years 8 months 22 days. Escapes. 4. There were 2 escapes from the Tubercle Section of this Hospital during the year under review. They were recaptured within 24 hours. Keepers responsible for the escapes were adequately punished. Daily average strength. 5. The daily average strength was 673.93 against 687.36 in 1934. Birth. 6. One pregnant female patient admitted in this Hospital gave birth to a male child on the 21st January 1935 who was disposed of through the Committing Magistrate on 8th Septem- ber 1935. Statement II. 7. This is the revision of Statement No. IA. This statement deals with observation cases for alleged lunacy. Forty-three cases were admitted during the year including 2 re-admissions and 4 cases were carried forward from the previous year. Of these 47, 28 were certified insane and admitted for safe custody and treat- ment, 2 certified and discharged under section 14 of the Indian Lunacy Act IV of 1912, Amendment Act XXXII of 1923, 15 were released as " uncertifiable " and 2 remained under observation at the end of the year. Statement III. 8. This is the revision of Statement No. II. This statement deals with criminal mental patients. The year opened with 256 criminal mental patients and 38 (including 3 re-admissions) were admitted during the year. Of this number, 22 were discharged and 29 died leaving 243 at the end of the year. The daily average strength was 249.85 against 258.58 in 1934.
2 A statement showing the classes of criminal lunatics is given below :3 (c) The statement below shows the percentage of inmates admitted in good indifferent and bad health during the past three years,4 Excluding Public Works Department charges, repairs and maintenance charges, rates and taxes, receipts from paying patients and profits on manufactures, the average cost per inmate worked out to Rs. 147-10-1 against Rs. 140-13-10 in 1934. (b) The profits in the manufactory department were Rs. 6,086-1-3 against Rs. 7,283-11-7 or an average of Rs. 87-14-4 per head of inmates employed on manufactures against Rs. 132-8-7 in 1934. The fall in profit was due to (i) fall in price of articles and (ii) fall in the yield of milk owing to foot-and-mouth disease of cows. The principal item of expenditure was the cost of "Diet" which amounted to Rs. 40,981-6-9 against Rs. 40,564-5-9 in 1934. Average cost per head was Rs. 60-7-10 against Rs. 58-12-9 in 1934. MISCELLANEOUS. Employment of patients. 15. (a) Male patients are employed in cultivation of vegetables, sugar-cane, jute, manufacture of gur, fencing of garden land, cane and bamboo works, carpentry, masonry, tailoring, dairy work and the usual domestic services. Females are employed on paddy husking, preparation of spices, mending clothes and other household works. Weaving is done both by male and female patients. (b) The special methods of treatment adopted were Hydrotheraphy, special dieting including artificial feeding in cases exhibiting active refusal of food, and occupational therapy. Garden. (c) The hospital garden continued to do well, yielding some profit and an use- ful addition to the dietary. Accommodation. (d) Accommodation available at the end of the year including all types of wards, cells and infirmaries, was 566 for males and 124 for females or a total of 690. The maximum number confined on any one night during the year was 690 against 704 in 1934. Conservancy. (e) Night soil is trenched in a selected site on the garden land and infected stools are incinerated outside the enclosure. Water-supply (f) Insufficiency of water in the male section still continues. The inadequacy of the water-supply has now reached a dangerous point and it is essential to provide necessary funds. A scheme is under consideration for making the hospital self-sufficient at a cost of approximately Rs. 16,000 and I trust that action will not be delayed much longer. Dairy. (g) Live-stock of Upper-Shillong Farm's cattle are a follows :5 (h) Fresh eggs were supplied from the Hospital Farm for the patients throughout the year. Poultry. Cleanliness. (i) Great care was taken in the difficult matter of personal cleanliness of inmates. Their clothing was boiled and washed weekly. Clothing. (j) Good and sufficient. Discipline. (k) Good. Amusement and recreation. (l) Mental patients were kept amused with music and games. Literate in- mates were provided with books and newspapers. Inspection. (m) The hospital was visited during the year by the Hon'ble the Judicial Mem- ber, Assam, once, the Commissioner of Assam Valley Division, once, and the Inspector General of Civil Hospitals, Assam, once. Meetings. (n) The Board of Visitors held 12 meetings during the year and individual members of the Board paid 10 additional visits including 2 of the Sessions Judge, Assam Valley Districts. The female section of the Hospital was visited on two occasions by the Lady Visitor, Sreejukta Hirabati Gohain Baruani. The whole population was regularly treated with vermifuge and vermicide for hook worms and other intestinal parasites. Skin diseases and cases of pyorrhoea alveolaris were regularly attended to. The whole population was protected with prophylactic dysentery bili-vaccine but the results do not appear to have justified the expenditure and issue will be discontinued. New admissions were always regularly vaccinated against small-pox and inoculated with cholera vaccine as a prophylactic measure. During the year under report 178 blood specimens (serum) were sent to the Provincial Laboratory, Shillong, for Wassermann test of which 11 were positive and they were given antisyphilitic treatment. In addition, the following were also sent to the Provincial Laboratory, Shillong : 6 The average number accommodated in 1935 was 673.93 as against 687.36 in 1934STATEMENTS.

ANNUAL REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE ASSAM MENTAL HOSPITAL, TEZPUR, FOR THE YEAR 1945. Introductory.2 The following analysis of the 8 Non-Criminal cases shows the benefit of early treatment : Discharged cured within 6 months ... ... ... ... ... ... 1 Ditto ditto 3 Statement No. V.4 Year after year the prevailing high rate of Mortality and Morbidity of this Institution has been telling its own tales. The inadequate and insufficient water supply problem of this Institution still remains as it was nearly two decades ago and thus this process of insidious undermining of the health of the inmates has been continuing. The provision of a segregated isolation ward for housing the Dysentery cases, which are now accommodated in the General Infirmary along with other patients is a pressing need. Statement below shows the causes of deaths during the last 3 years5 The increase in profit was due to higher prices of the articles and to increased productions. The daily average number employed was 38.32 against 40.00 in the previous year. Paragraph 5.6 Diet.Statement
