Something may be done, and is being done, but in many cases entire reconstruction alone will meet the requirements of the case. " The old mud hut, with flat or tiled or thatched roof and mud wall enclosure, without light or ventilation, except what it receives through the door, is still the typical residence of the sepoy and his family. " The sepoy huts himself; he is not hutted, as I believe he ought to be, by Government, and as he must be if ever huts and lines are to be constructed on sanitary principles. He keeps his hut in repair, which is all he is able to do, for he has no margin of funds for improvements or for sanitary arrangements properly so called. Nothing is so expensive as disease, and Govern- -ment would be the gainers in the end were they to hut their Native troops as they house their European soldiers. The new lines being erected for the 36th Regiment N. I. at Bangalore show what may be done in this direction. The site is an admirable one, its slope gives facilities for drainage, the drainage arrangements, when completed, will be good; the huts are well planned, the domestic conveniences are suitable and the regimental latrines nearly perfect. The expenditure, however, has been too great, and the earlier erected portions of the lines are probably less substantial than those more recently built. In the several reports from executive medical officers, attention has been called to the condition of the lines and various improvements suggested. In many cases the sites are bad, in other unhealthy, in many the lines are overcrowded, and in most the huts are badly ventilated, the drainage defective, and the soil polluted.

The 12th Regiment N.I. moved from Vizianagrum on the 12th and reached Cuttack on the 25th March; the journey having been performed by steamer from Bimlipatam, viâ False Point to Saldundah, and thence by land to Cuttack. b . The 41st Regiment N.I. proceeded from Cuttack to Vizianagrum in March 1876. c. Three companies of this corps were sent to the Bustar country, and absent between the 8th and 25th April from head-quarters. d. The 7th Regiment N.I., during the disturbance in Buster, furnished in March a detachment to that tract of country; but when it reached Manapoorum, information having been received that the disturbance was quelled, it was ordered to return to Vizagapatam, and reached head-quarters on the 1st April 1876. e. Orders again having been received on the 2nd April, another detachment, a whole Wing in fact, was sent on the 4th, which, after the completion of its duty, returned to Vizagapatam about the end of April. f. A third detachment was sent to Cocanada in December to suppress rice riots, and it is still at that port. g. A Wing of the 41st Regiment N.I. proceeded to the Godavery and Kistna districts on the 21st November 1876. Huts and lines. Huts and lines.28 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF MADRAS. There are no independent drains leading from each hut into the larger drains running between the rows of lines, and on account of this all the sewage and impurities must naturally percolate into the loose sandy soil on which the huts are built. "The sanitary condition of the vicinity of the lines is not very satisfactory; on account of there being no public latrine near, the people of the neighboring villages resort to a piece of ground situated close to the lines, which they make use of as a latrine." Surgeon Warder, of the 41st Regiment N.I., states:NORTHERN DISTRICT. 29 The medical officers at Sumbulpore, Cuttack, Berhampore, Vizagapatam and Vizia- nagrum reiterate their complaints of defects in the lines, in which the huts are to a great extent overcrowded, and their drainage imperfect and inefficient. Surgeon Boalth deprecates any attempt to improve the present lines as certain to be futile, but urges their removal to a different and eligible locality. The desolation wrought by last cyclone in the lines of the 7th Regiment N. I. at Vizagapatam presented a good but neglected opportunity for their removal to another and better site, so that they continue where they were. Surgeon Dalgairns reports that the hospital of the European Artillery Veteran Company at Vizagapatam is at last undergoing much and long-needed repairs; while Surgeon Boalth, in Berhampore, intimates that trenches are being excavated for the foundations of a new, in lieu of the former small and ill-ventilated, latrine. Surgeon-Major Parker at Cuttack solicits attention to the imperfect, because insufficient, accommodation of the hospital for the sick of a whole regiment, and wisely recommends filling up two tanks in front of the hospital with earth. 2 nd Regiment Native Infantry.

The site is not a healthy one.

The health condition of the European Commissioned, Warrant and Non-Commissioned Officers has been on the whole, unsatisfactory. One death occurred amongst the Commissioned Officers on the Division Staff in the person of Deputy Surgeon-General L. W. Stewart, from sunstroke at Trichinopoly, induced by protracted tour of inspection in the Malabar district and Wynaad, and consequent exhaustion, at a time when sickness of every kind was very prevalent in that part of the circle of medical administration. The civil population suffered considerably from cholera epidemics, the mortality being very high amongst them. A strict quarantine resulted in a great immunity of the prisoners in the Central Jail at Trichinopoly, whilst the convicts of the District Jail were sent into camp five miles distant from Trichinopoly. There were, however, 3 cases in the Central and 8 in the District Jails; the whole of the former recovered, while 4 cases in the latter proved fatal. Cholera may be said to have prevailed throughout the whole of this circle epidemically during the year under report. Comparing the year under review with the preceding one, the admissions into hospital, were cholera and dengue excluded, would have been smaller, but as it stands, the admissions have increased by 25, while the mortality remains the same as in the past year. No recommendations have been found necessary to offer, further than maintaining the sanitary condition of every part of the head-quarter station, which, under municipal direction, is, on the whole, satisfactory. The year under review has followed the course of the preceding one, 1875. Cholera prevailed epidemically throughout the circle, and the rainfall has been totally deficient owing to the complete failure of the north-east monsoon. At Trichinopoly, which is the head-quarter station of the circle, there was a deficiency in the rainfall to the extent of 15 inches as compared with the previous year. To this deficiency of rain may be attributed the shortness of the cold weather and the intense heat of the summer months. The state of cholera within this circle has been as under:SOUTHERN DISTRICT. 39 The following return shows the rates of sickness, deaths, and invaliding, as contrasted with previous years:40 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF MADRAS. 32nd Regiment Native Infantry.

The rainfall at Bellary has been less of late years that it was formerly, and probably a large part of the Ceded Districts suffers in the same way, which opens a wide question as to the causes which are in operation and under which the face of this part of India is slowly changing. Both monsoons were equally deficient in 1876. The season is reported by the medical officers (without referring to the meteorological statistics) as one of dry heat and the cold weather more marked than usual. At the French Rocks the rainfall was deficient, and the thermometer has shown a much higher degree of temperature for a longer time than is usual at this station. At Mysore there was a great deficiency of rain during the year, only 22 inches and 80¾ cents having fallen; the average rainfall is about 30 inches per annum. At Mercara in Coorg the climate is reported to have been milder than that of the two previous years. Sanitary. Sanitary.

In both military divisions the admissions and average daily sick have been less than in the preceding year, but the mortality was somewhat greater. The total loss from all causes of the troops in both military commands during the past year has been 202, viz., 59 deaths and 143 pensioned and discharged, being at the rate of 42.45 per 1,000 of strength. In the Mysore Division the decrement was 111, or at the rate of 34.31 per mille of strength. In the Ceded Districts it was 91, or at the rate of 59.86 per mille of strength. In the preceding year the loss was 216, namely, 37 deaths and 179 pensioned and discharged. In the Mysore Division, the admissions have been at the rate of 559 per thousand, and the mortality both in and out of hospital 12.67. In the Ceded Districts the admissions have been 586.50 per thousand and the deaths in and out 11.82. Statement No. II exhibits in two tables the same facts as they occurred in the different regiments in the two military divisions. From these, it appears that the highest ratio of admissions, excluding the garrison of Bangalore, whose average annual strength was only 12.59, occurred in the 23rd Regiment Light Infantry at Bangalore. Taking the admissions into hospital as the measure of the degree of unhealthiness of the different regiments, they may be ranged in the following order, omitting the garrisons of Banga- lore and Bellary, which consist of a few superannuated pensioners.

N.I. 721.59 4th Light Cavalry 699.86 27th Regiment N.I. 698.16 30th do. ,, 516.72 21st do. ,, 382.82 36th do. ,, 271.94 Although the numbers in the first four indicate a high rate of sickness, it is less (with the exception of the cavalry corps) than in the previous year; and the improvement in the case of the 28th Native Infantry at Mercara is very marked, the admissions having been at the rate of 10.86 per mille in the preceding year. The improvement is doubtless due to the men being better housed and also in some degree to their becoming acclimatized. The high sick rate of the 27th at Bellary and the 23rd at Bangalore must be ascribed in the former to its antecedent history, and in the latter partly to the same cause, and partly to the faulty position of the regimental lines. If ranged in the order of mortality in each corps, they will stand as follows:58 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF MADRAS. STATEMENT No. III. Divisions. Years. Ratio per 1,000.

From this it appears that the admis- sions into hospital, the average daily sick, and the number invalided, have been less in the Mysore Division during the year 1876 than in any of the preceding four years; but that the mortality has been somewhat higher. In the Ceded Districts the admissions and average daily sick, though lower than the year 1875, have been higher than in the three antecedent years, but the mortality and invaliding have been greater than in any of the four preceding years.

Debility, though often feigned, is very often also real, and is the result of insufficient nourishment, the sepoy often having as many as six or eight people dependent upon him. STATEMENT No. VIII.

Not only is this true of the aggregate mortality, but also of that of each corps in the entire administrative circle, with the single exception of the 21st Native Infantry at Bellary. In 1875 the ratio of deaths per 1,000 of strength was 30.14. In the year 1876 it was 33.43. The highest mortality occurred in the 28th Regiment at Mercara, and the lowest in the 21st at Bellary. The 23rd Regiment at Bangalore and the 27th at Bellary show the next highest rate of mortality in the order in which they have been named. The 4th Light Cavalry comes next. The ratio of mortality in this last-mentioned regiment was just double that of the previous year. As the families of sepoys live under better hygienic conditions than the general population of the country, the mortality amongst them may be safely taken to be less than that of the latter, and consequently the mortuary returns, which give an average mortality of 26.51 per 1,000 during the past year for the general population of Mysore and the Ceded Districts, must be very defective. In the 28th Regiment at Mercara the deaths were 79; 31 of which among adults and 48 children. In the 23rd Regiment at Bangalore 14 were adults and 53 children. In the 27th at Bellary they were in the proportion of 23 to 24. This table shows that the health of the families corresponds pretty accurately with that of the sepoys, as might be expected, for both are exposed to the same influences of climate and locality. The families, however, suffer more from such influences when they are injurious than do the sepoys, for they consist of weaker members, and are less directly under the paternal care of the State.

Accommodation .66 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF MADRAS. The return from Bellary is less satisfactory in more than one point of view. It is unsatisfactory as being incorrect, and it would be equally unsatisfactory if correct. The 'period of occupation' of the European troops has been taken to mean the entire period at the station, instead of the period included in the year 1876, and as the average strength and number of admissions profess to be calculated for the same period, they must be vitiated by the original error, and are therefore unreliable. According to the statement forwarded by Surgeon-Major Cleveland, the ratio of admissions for venereal diseases among the European troops at Bellary was 252.83 per 1,000 of strength. For primary syphilis the admissions were at the rate of 153.94, and secondary syphilis 16.85 per 1,000 respectively. The Lock Hospital Committee at Bangalore is composed ofMYSORE DIVISION. 67 68 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF MADRAS. working of the Contagious Diseases' Act must be attributed to causes which are beyond the sphere of the Medical Officer's duties. The limitation of the operation of the Act to women who are known to consort with European soldiers is one of the principal causes of the comparative failure of the detective agency, for it is a most difficult thing to prove legally, even when there can be no moral doubt of the fact, that a particular woman receives the visits of European soldiers for an immoral purpose. Until all women who practise prostitution in a military station, whether with Natives or Europeans, are brought under the operation of the law on this subject, the rôle of the lock hospitals will be limited, as at present, to the compara- tively modest one of curtailing the number of diseased women who are at large, and so extenuating the evil which it was hoped, rather too sanguinely, they would altogether exterminate.

Apart from the different opinions that exist as to the beneficial results of quarantine, and which would probably prevent any such arrangement being carried out unless all the authorities concerned, Political, Military, Civil and Medical, not only m Secunderabad and Chudderghaut but also in the " city " of Hyderabad itself, were all of one mind. There is the fact that Hyderabad is nearly always in a chronic state of cholera, and that a quarantine has never been established here, the reason being perhaps its utter impracticability owing to the open situation of the cantonment, its accessibility from all sides not being confined to roads, and the constant stream of intercourse between the three mentioned places. Small-pox. Small-pox was the cause of one admission into the hospital of the 3rd Light Infantry; the patient made a good recovery, though as a sequel he suffered from interstitial corneitis of both eyes. He had been twice vaccinated unsuccessfully some years ago. Six cases were admitted into the hospital of the 40th Native Infantry. All these cases had been previously successfully vaccinated; the disease was of a modified type; all made good recoveries. Vaccination, regimental. Vaccination, regimental.

At "Aberdeen" there are three barracks, precisely similar to each other; they are about 70 feet above sea level, built of teak on 8 feet angle iron piles. They were quite clean and venti- lated by two doors 7' 3" × 3' 10" each and twenty-two windows 3' 10" square and eave ventilation. Each barrack has likewise four corner-rooms for Native officers and a verandah on each side 12 feet wide. Lighting is effected by two lamps in each barrack at night. Each barrack accommodates forty men and is 110' × 20' × 13=28,600 cubic feet and 2,200 square feet, giving an average of 715 cubic feet and 55 square feet to each man during the year. Each corner-room has one door 7'-5" × 3' 10" and three windows 3' 10" square. Each room is occupied by one Native or Non-commissioned officer and lighted by one lamp. There is a fourth barrack not yet quite completed, precisely similar to the others, but half as large again. The drainage is both artificial and natural, but is insufficient, as the soil is non-absorbent and, during the monsoon like a quagmire. There should be deep subsoil drains like those used to drain wet lands in England.

They were occupied by the 39th last year, but are empty now as the 39th have left and the wing of the 4th has not yet arrived. Each barrack runs east and west, and is built of wood on piles varying from 4 to 6 feet high, and has a shingled roof. They are all very old buildings and have been condemned. New ones will be built, I understand, when funds are available. They are all similar in construction in every respect. They are clean, and ventilated by eight doers each 7' x 4' and thirty-two windows each 3'3" x 3'. The skirting board is raised on hinges all round and there is likewise ridge ventilation. Each barrack is lighted by three oil lamps at night and measures 201' x 21' x 16'= 4,221 square feet and 67,536 cubic feet. A board at the end of each barrack indicates. that it affords accommodation for 100 men, but during the past year each man enjoyed an average of 70 square feet and 1,125 cubic feet. At the corners of each barrack is a room, but on a lower level 22' x 11', for native and non-commissioned officers. It has a door and three windows of above dimensions. These corner-rooms project, and the roof of each barrack projects also to a similar extent, so that a broad covered verandah or passage is formed the whole length of the barrack on each side. Each barrack is entered from this verandah by 4 ladders. The barracks are built on a gentle slope, so that the site is favorable to drainage, which is assisted by superficial earth-drains.
