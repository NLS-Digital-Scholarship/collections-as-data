No. 1113. FROM THE SURGEON-GENERAL, INDIAN MEDICAL DEPARTMENT, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, MILITARY DEPARTMENT. Fort William, the 21st November 1876. SIR, I HAVE the honor to forward, for submission to the Right Hon'ble the Governor-General in Council, the Medical and Sanitary Report of the na- tive army of the Bengal Presidency for the year 1875, the compilation of which has been conducted, under my superintendence, by Surgeon-Major J. Browne, M.D., who officiates as my Secretary, during the absence on fur- lough of Surgeon K. McLeod, M.D. Compilation of report. 2. While trying to avoid all useless repetitions, I have again found how difficult it is to condense or abbreviate the sanitary reports of medical officers, inasmuch as they contain a vast amount of information of a special kind, relating to the varying sanitary and climatic conditions under which the native army has been placed in this presidency; and I am, moreover, of opinion, that any attempt at a more complete abridgment, would only tend to lessen that wholesome spirit of emulation which helps to stimulate the interest taken by most medical officers in the preparation and compilation of these reports.

In statement No. I is shown the strength of the Native Army in the Bengal Presidency, in- cluding the Madras troops serving within it, as compiled from the weekly and annual re- turns of every. regi- ment and battery com- posing, it. In this statement, the strength of the army is shown as sub-divided into "pre- sent" and "absent:" the former gives the numbers which sup- plied the admissions into hospital, while the latter shows the numbers absent on furlough, sick leave, &c., and those small detachments from which no statis- tical returns" were received, as they were not under the charge of any special medical officer, or subordinate. The strength of the Bengal native troops in this presidency during 1875. was in excess of that of 1874 by 304 men while the Madras troops were less by 151. The ratio of absentees in the Bengal army was 14.6 per cent. of total strength, and Of the Madras troops 5.6. Such Strength of the army. Strength sub- divided into "present " and "absent.' 1
ii a marked difference in the numbers absent is in a great measure owing, I pre- sume, to the Madras sepoys having their families with them, as well as to the distance of their present stations in Bengal from their homes in Madras.

Number in- effective from sickness. Sick leave. The ratio of admis- sions and daily sick of both the Bengal and Madras troops was less than in 1874, but that of mortality,has been slightly higher; and this excess was mainly dependent on the death-rate of the men of the Punjab Frontier Force, which was.81 per cent. higher than in 1874. The ratios of the Madras troops, while again contrasting favorably with those of the Bengal army as a whole, do not vary much from those of the Central India Force, a fact tending to prove that an equable climate, in which the range of temperature is not excessive, is conducive to the preservation of health. The Punjab Frontier Force still continues to be the least healthy portion of the Bengal army; but yet its ratio of sickness and mortality has not been at all excessive, not higher than might have been expected to result from service in a climate in which extreme ranges of temperature prevail, as well as from duties which occasionally were of a very arduous nature, and entailed no small amount of exposure on those employed on them. The re- gular army ranked next as regards sickness and mortality. The Central India Force, while slightly in excess of the Madras troops as regards sickness, was also somewhat under them in the death-rate. But on the whole, and perhaps for the reasons already mentioned, the statistics of the latter are the most favorable. The number of men constantly in hospital, whose services were therefore lost to the Government, was 2,166, or equal to 3.02 battalions of 715 men against 3.27 in 1874. Each case spent an average of 11.02 days in hos- pital, and each sepoy of the entire army 13.03, against 11.2 and 13 in 1874. In addition also, 1,267 men, or 2.02 per cent. of strength, proceeded on sick leave against 1.6, 2.08, 2.4, 2.10, and 1.91 in the preceding five years. The number of days spent by these men on sick leave was 164,862, which gives an average of 451.6 men constantly absent on this account, or equal to.63 of a battalion. It is thus brought out that there were 2,617.6 men continually ineffective from sickness, or 4.88 per cent. of strength (present)iii STATEMENT No. III. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 UNDER 25.

In Statement No. VI, the statistics of the native army (excluding the Madras troops) for 1875 are compared with those of the ten preceding years. The statistics for the year 1865 refer to the regular army only, but the remain- der include those of the entire native army. The comparison is very favorable to the statis- tics of 1875, inasmuch as the rates of sickness and mortality were be- low the average of the preceding decennial period. The year 1875 was, however, not re- markable for any un- usual sickness; but the native army has seldom suffered from disease in a severe epidemic form. *For the regular army only.

Deaths per cent. of Strength. 1* 2viii. 19. Having concluded a brief review of the effect which climate and locality of stations exerted on the sickness and mortality of the native army, I shall now consider how far these two factors (climate and locality) were influenced by other and most important sanitary conditions, such as ventilation of buildings, over-crowding, drainage, water-supply, diet, clothing, &c. 20. That the conditions just enumerated exert an all-important influence, whether for good or evil, on the health of every community, has for some years past been an acknowledged fact; and I feel great pleasure in being able to re- port to Government, that the regimental medical officers of Her Majesty's Indian Army are not only particularly well informed on all such sanitary details, but that the attention they have individually bestowed on every question relating to the health of the men under their charge, and the cordial co-operation accorded by commanding officers of regiments, to their generally sound and practical recommendations, have together, in no small degree, contributed to exert a most beneficial influence on the health of the sepoys. 21. A general knowledge of the laws of health is the outcome of observa- tion and good common sense, rather than of any very profound medical or chemical education; and it is no small matter that every man in a regiment, from the commanding officer downwards, has the opportunity for becoming more or less conversant with the more ordinary, though none the less important, subjects of hygiene, from having a medical officer associated with them, who, himself well acquainted with the rules for preserving health, is able, both by example and teaching, to impress those around him with their importance. Benefits resulting from camp life and marching. 22. Every one of Indian experience is aware of the benefit which accrues to health from marching and camp life in the North-Western Provinces, Oudh, and the Punjab during the cold weather; and the opinions recorded in the several sanitary reports, as to the good effects which camp life exerted on the health of the men (some of whom were much debilitated as a result of duty in unhealthy stations) fully corroborate this belief. Medical officers agree as to the good effects of camp life. 23. All the medical officers agree that the marches in ordinary course of relief were attended by good results, while some (whose regiments had been previously very unhealthy) bear the most unqualified testimony to the decided improvement which the march and residence afterwards at the camp of exer- cise effected in the health of the men; thus, of the 4th Regiment, Bengal Cavalry, we are told that the health of the men improved, and this though they were sometimes as many as eight and nine hours in the saddle. The medical officer of the 28th Regiment, Bengal Infantry, writes that when the regiment commenced the march from Cawnpore to Delhi it was very weakly, and at one time there were 70 men on the convalescent list; but the march and the exercise at the camp had a wonderful and most gratifying result on the health of the men. The sowars of the 11th Bengal Cavalry had suffered a good deal from intermittent fever while at Meean Meer, but they improved in health and strength during the six weeks they were encamped at Delhi. Relief and service in 1857. 24. The following regiments were moved in course of relief, or were at the camp of exercise at Delhi, during 1875, viz., 12 regiments of Bengal Cavalry, 4 companies of Sappers and Miners, and 18 regiments of Bengal Infantry, in course of ordinary relief; and 8 regiments of Bengal Cavalry, the head-quarters and 6 companies of the Sappers and Miners, and 15 regi- ments of Bengal Infantry were at the camp of exercise at Delhi. The remarks in the preceding paragraph tend to prove the beneficial effect which marching and camp life exerted on the health of the men so employed, and is amply confirmatory of former experience on this point. Topography of stations. 25. I have, with few exceptions, omitted the topographical descriptions of stations from this report, for the simple reason that they have been mostly supplied in previous years, and therefore valuable space would be taken up by a useless repetition; however, those which have been submitted appear to be carefully prepared, and evince an anxiety on the part of medical officers to become acquainted not only with the peculiarities of the stations in which they were serving, but also with those of the district generally. Meteorology. 26. Meteorological observations I have also in a great measure omitted, as regimental hospitals are not supplied with instruments with which observa- tions of any practical value can be made. At the same time, however, as I
ix believe there is a very intimate connexion between certain meteorological phenomena and the outbreak of cholera in an epidemic form, as well as of malarious fevers, I am glad to see all the large military cantonments being supplied with a complete set of instruments, with which correct and valuable observations are made by a properly qualified observer. 27. Notwithstanding the widening and deepening of the Aboo Nullah at Meerut, the subsoil water of that station is said to have risen steadily during the past year. The influence, if any, which the rise of the subsoil water may have exerted on the increase or decline of malarious fevers, is not very con- vincingly proved, nor has it been incontrovertibly shown that those diseases, which now-a-days are generally attributed to a damp subsoil, have become strikingly more prevalent. The widening and deepening of the Aboo Nullah at Meerut. 28. The cultivation and planting of trees in cantonments and regimental lines seem to be very properly increasing in favor. It is now understood that trees (planted with certain precautions), instead of proving causes of sickness, will on the contrary act most beneficially by preserving the purity and increas- ing the moisture of the atmosphere, as well as by protecting us from extremes of temperature, likewise affording a grateful shade by their foliage at those seasons when shade is most required and most highly appreciated. Cultivation and planting of trees. 29. Very little requires to be said regarding the huts or barracks in which the sepoys were located. The barracks are generally reported on as having been well ventilated and not overcrowded, and they will for many reasons most probably prove to be the buildings best suited for the requirements of the unmarried soldiers of the native army. During the past year, eight new barracks were built in the native infantry lines at Bareilly, and on a plan uniform with those previously existing. Each man in these barracks has now 50 square feet of superficial room, and 480 cubic feet of breathing space. At Dehra, also, twenty new barracks (each one for two families) were completed for the married men of the 2nd Goorkhas; and it is reported that they are well raised, and that in them the ventilation, breathing space, and superficial room are all that can be desired. Barracks and huts. 30. A good many medical officers consider the ventilation of the regi- mental huts to have been defective; but taking their construction into account, I am not prepared to admit that it has been so in all stations. That the huts are small, low, badly lighted, and, according to our ideas, afford but indifferent accommodation for their inmates, cannot be doubted, but from the fact of their being roofed (in some stations) with a single layer of tiles, through the inter- stices of which there must always be a free circulation of air; and besides, being either without doors or else provided with very badly fitting ones, it does not appear probable that there has been a deficiency of ventilation in them, nor do the reports bring forward any evidence sufficiently conclusive, from which the opinion can be formed that sickness has been caused through defective ventilation. I find that cooking was in some cases carried on inside the huts or barracks, and that the floors of the huts of a regiment serving in Peshawar were dug out below the level of the surrounding ground, in order, it is said, to allow of the men standing upright in them. It may be almost unnecessary to remark that such proceedings are objectionable. Ventilation of huts considered defective. 31. I have long been of opinion that the drainage (surface and subsoil) of many military cantonments is defective, and that it has been one, if not the principal, of the causes on which outbreaks of cholera and of malarious fever were dependent. It would take up too much valuable space, and would extend this report much beyond its proper limits, if I attempted to explain the reasons from which I have arrived at the above conclusions; but to settle the question definitely, to what extent defective surface and subsoil drainage may be considered as the causes of cholera and of malarious fevers, I should like to see any one station of known unhealthiness thoroughly drained; the result might be worth the outlay. That the drainage of a good number of regimental lines was not efficient, there is evidence in the sanitary reports; thus, in the lines of the 10th Regiment, Bengal Infantry, at Barrackpore, it is reported that, at certain seasons, the drains serve as inlets for the river water and that from tanks. They thus become reservoirs for the surface filth of the station, and give off most offensive odours when drying up. Of the Sappers Drainage. 3
x and Miners' lines at Roorkee, it is stated that there is a great deal of solar evaporation when silt or badly constructed culverts choke the out-fall. Whether the heavy rain which occurred on the 10th of May, and the after evaporation. under a powerful sun, may have tended to cause the cholera which broke out on the 14th of the same month, and continued for 10 days, is a point worthy of consideration, though the medical officer considers there was no connexion between the disease and those electrical storms. At Gauhati, the lines are situated in the centre of a low swampy tract of ground, from which there is no natural drainage, and the artifical substitute for it is described as being as imperfect as can well be imagined. The subsoil water throughout the station is at no greater depth than one or two feet from the surface. The medical officer of the 25th Regiment, Bengal Infantry, at Meean Meer, considers that the sickness in the regiment was caused by the heavy rainfall of October, November, and early part of December, conjoined with defective drainage. Wet encamping grounds along the line of march of the 4th Goorkhas to the Delhi camp were, along with the effects of climate, considered to have been the cause of a good deal of sickness in the regiment. The fever cases which occurred in the 5th Regiment, Bengal Light Infantry, at Meerut, were considered to have been caused by the swampy condition of some ground close by the lines after the rains. The lines of the 17th Native Infantry at Morar, situated between the confluence of the Morar and Biswas rivers, are considered to be unhealthy. Conservancy. Horse litter. 32. All the reports tend to show that the conservancy of cantonments and regimental lines was carefully attend to; this is what might be expected, as, independently of the interest which commanding officers take in the neat appearance and general cleanliness of their lines, all matters that require removal by the conservancy establishment generally attract notice. The horse litter in cavalry regiments can, as a rule, be disposed of to zemindars for manure; but where this cannot be done, it should, as is the practice in some stations, be burned. Nullahs. Nullahs in or near cantonments generally become the receptacles for filth of all kinds; their sides are overgrown with jungle, and except in very dry weather, or in very dry climates, they generally contain a greater or smaller quantity of stagnant and very filthy water; these nullahs on this account require constant supervision, otherwise they may, in all probability, become causes of sickness.

The conservancy of latrines appears to have been very carefully attended to, but still a great deal remains to be done in this direction. It appears from the reports that in many of the stations in the North-West and North-East Frontiers, in Central and perhaps here and there in stations occupied by the line regiments, the men follow the primitive system of visiting the adjacent jungle or cultivation for necessary purposes; and though restrictions may have been imposed on them as to the distance they should go to, and the locality they should frequent, yet the following extracts will tend to prove that this primitive system, which still has many supporters, is, to say the least of it, a most objectionable one, if it may not be also prejudicial. The medical officer of the 3rd Punjab Infantry, stationed at Edwardesabad, reports that the men have to resort to the cultivated fields which come to within 50 yards of the fort; these emit a constant stench, generally more per- ceptible in the evening, and it is considered that the station cannot become even tolerably healthy "so long as it continues to lie in an atmosphere of fxi. such effects upon all constitutions under its influence, as to render them more prone to disease and less amenable to treatment." The difficulty which, on the first introduction of the trench system, was experienced in getting the sepoys, who are very conservative of old customs, to resort to the latrines, appears to be gradually declining; but still these arrangements are not quite in accordance with native ideas; thus the latrines may be at an inconvenient distance from the lines, or they may not afford sufficient privacy, and segregation according to caste, while in wet weather the ground inside of them is, without doubt, both disgusting and offensive. Difficulty in getting sepoys to use latrines is gradually being over- come. It is nevertheless probable that the "trench system," with certain improvements in the construction of the screens, and with a sufficient staff of sweepers in attendance, is perhaps the most economical and suitable for the requirements of a large body of men; while permanent latrines, on the "dry- earth" system, with a plentiful supply of the dry deodorizing material, under constant and careful supervision, in order to ensure the immediate removal of the excreta and the cleansing of the floors in case of defilement, have also been found to answer very well for hospital use. At all events the effective working of either system can only be ensured by keeping up a sufficient number of sweepers under due supervision. The "trench system." "Dry-earth" system. The disposal of the sewage of Fort William, regarding which there has been a great difference of opinion, is likely to be finally and satisfactorily arranged for by connecting the drains with the municipal sewers. If this scheme is carried out, the pollution of the river, and the deposit of sewage mud along its foreshore, both above and below the point of discharge, will be prevented; but it will remain to be seen whether the diversion of the Fort sewage from the river will lessen the number of cholera cases amongst the shipping population. My conviction is that it will be an unimportant factor. Disposal of the sewage of Fort William. The latrine used by the men of the 4th Bengal Cavalry, at Meerut, was divided into sections for the different castes, and by this means, it is said that its unpopularity as a regimental institution was lessened. The trench latrine system has been introduced for the first time in the station of Dibrugarh, and promises to be a great sanitary success. Latrine of the 4th B. C. 34. The water-supply in general use by the native army may be considered to have been of fairly good quality and abundant; and, with few exceptions, there is no evidence to prove that sickness resulted from its use. The principle seems to be now fairly established that the best water should be preserved for drinking purposes; that all chances of its defilement from outside sources should be avoided; and that, in any doubtful cases of its purity, it should be treated by filtration or boiling before being used for drinking purposes. Water-supply During the latter half of the year, the regiments at Barrackpore were supplied with pipe water, and this was a great sanitary improvement, as the tank water which had been previously consumed was considered to be of very doubtful purity. In the 28th Regiment, Punjab Native Infantry, at Alipore, and the 39th Regiment, Native Infantry, at Barrackpore, the medical officers consi- dered that diarrhxii Under-feed- ing, bad re- sults of. Under-feeding is always, sooner or later, followed by a steady deterioration of the health of those men who, for the sake of saving a few rupees monthly, follow the practice; but in unhealthy climates (such as is the relaxing and malarious one of Lower Bengal for natives from the upper provinces) under- feeding means something more, and aids the climate in rapidly bringing on a condition which some medical officers consider to be true scurvy, while others consider it to be merely a state of malarious cachexia. There is no doubt, however, that this deterioration in health, the result of the combined effect of unfavorable climatic conditions and the use of insufficient or im- proper food, renders the men quite unfit for active service of any kind, and for its cure, change of air and proper dietary are essential. In less severe cases, a complete exemption from duty with a generous diet, of which animal food and a spirit ration should form a part, may suffice to restore health. Vege- tables were generally readily procurable in all stations, though occasionally they were expensive and thus beyond the sepoys' means. Troop-mess- ing in the 7th Bengal Cavalry. A system of troop-messing has been introduced into the 7th Regiment, Bengal Cavalry, and is reported to have worked well. The men of all the troops, except the 4th, which is composed of high-class Hindoos, eat in a body, and the advantages claimed for this system are a saving of labor and a saving of expense, as there is no waste; it is also a check against under-feeding, as each member of the mess has to pay an equal share of the expenses. Although, on account of caste prejudices, it may be a difficult, or perhaps an impossible, matter to interfere in any appreciable way with the dieting of the sepoy, still the subject is one of most pressing importance, when it is considered how great is the influence which a sufficiency of good food exerts on his proper effectiveness. On these grounds it might be worthy of consideration whether stringent and definite orders, issued regimentally, might not be enforced, which would compel the native soldier to consume a full ration daily. It appears from the reports that commanding end medical officers have done all in their power to secure the issue of supplies of the best quality, and to prevent under-feeding in their regiments. Uniform. 36. All the reports tend to prove that the uniform of the native army was considered to have been well suited for the climate and for the duties the men had to perform; but it is the opinion of medical officers that the recruits, and occasionally the sepoys, have not got a proper supply of suitable undress clothing, the result being that chest and bowel diseases were more prevalent among such men. The following extracts prove the importance of bestowing attention on this subject, viz., the medical officer of the 35th Regiment, Native Infantry, considers that the good health of the men under his charge was in a great measure attributable to the care bestowed on their clothing. It is stated that the men of the 2nd Regiment, Native Infantry, were not provided with a suffi- cient amount of bedding, and that from this cause, chiefly, several cases of rheuma- tism occurred during the march from Dinapore. The men of the 29th Regiment, Native Infantry, at Peshawar, were supplied with "posteens," and it was con- sidered with the effect of lessening the general sickness and the number of chest diseases. A "posteen" was issued to each recruit of the 27th Regiment, Native Infantry, and it is said there was a sufficiency of these garments in the quarter-master's store with which to supply each man when mounting guard at night. Cases of pneumonia might possibly be lessened by a sufficiency of warm undress clothing. 37. It is well known how prevalent and how fatal pneumonia has been in regiments at stations in Northern India, and at those along the North-West- ern Frontier. Medical officers do not appear to be quite agreed as to the etiology of this disease, nor have I any intention of discussing it in this report; but, considering the seasons, and the meteorological conditions existing when these attacks are most prevalent, I consider that if greater attention was paid to the undress clothing of the men, the result would be a diminution of such cases, and of the mortality resulting from them. Exemption of the Guide Corps from pneumonia. The medical officer of the Guide Corps, when remarking on the freedom of the regiment from pneumonia during the past year, states that he attributes it to the capital clothing and the care that was taken to ensure the men when off duty being warmly clad; and his experience, gained during some years' service on the North-Western Frontier, leads him to look on neglect, in respect of warm undress clothing, as the principal, if not the only, cause of pneumonia.
xiii I consider the principle is all but universally applicable. Insufficiency of the diet and scanty supply of warm under-clothing are the chief agents in the production of the bulk of the diseases from which sepoys suffer. I have written somewhat at length on this subject, because having due regard to every matter within my province, which will increase the efficiency of the native army and prevent sickness amongst its members, I have felt it to be my duty to bring prominently to notice the fact of the sepoys beingxiv interesting account of the expedition, written by Deputy Surgeon-General Tyrell Ross, was published as an appendix to last year's report; and the medical officers whose regiments were employed there have supplied all further necessary information in their sanitary reports. Medical his- tory of the 1st Goorkha Regiment on service in the Malay Peninsula. 41. This year I publish, as an appendix, a very capital report written by Surgeon C. F. Oldham, 1st Goorkha Regiment, which contains a complete, practical, and interesting account of the medical and sanitary history of the regiment while employed on service, from 26th November 1875 to 31st March 1876, in the Malay Peninsula. Gymnasia. 42. The training the sepoys now undergo in station and regimental gymnasia seems, wherever reported on, to have been highly useful in setting them up, and in developing their muscles and general physique; and is, moreover, quite in keeping with the natural direction of the sepoys' inclinations. Hospitals. 43. The hospitals may be considered to have generally afforded ample accommodation for the sick, and to have been liberally supplied with medicines and the surgical appliances necessary for their proper treatment. There was a deficiency in some places of such minor articles as chicks, door-mats, &c., matters which, taken separately, may be of trifling importance, yet, when considered collectively, tend to add to the comfort of the sick very materi- ally. However, great improvements in the equipment of hospitals of native regiments are being gradually introduced. As the new hospital for the sick of the 2nd Goorkhas at Dehra was not likely to be completed for another year, a temporary one was erected under regimental arrangements, with the result of adding materially to the comfort of the sick and the convenience of the men in the regiment. It was considered necessary too, on sanitary grounds, that the old hospital, which was a long way from the new cantonments, and whose walls and floors must have been saturated with the impure exhalations of 40 years' occupancy, should be abandoned, since, by doing so, all communi- cation with Dehra could, in case of any epidemic disease, be completely shut off. On the completion of the new hospital, this temporary one will be made over for the accommodation of the sick women and children of the regiment. Bath-rooms in hospitals. 44. The patients, most probably on account of caste prejudices, do not seem to have generally made much use of the hospital bath-rooms; but it was of no small assistance to the medical officers to have had the means at hand for the immediate preparation of baths of the required temperature in the treatment of any cases requiring them. Hospitals in Rawal Pindi Circle, and in North-West- ern Frontier stations. 45. The hospitals in the Rawal Pindi Circle are described as being very cold and draughty, and on this account to be but badly suited for the proper treatment of the sick during the cold season (particularly of those suffering from chest and bowel diseases), even though they are provided with doors, purdahs, and fires. I do not consider it necessary to dwell upon these state- ments, because I consider it impossible that any one building can ever, quite successfully, meet the requirements of seasons differing so widely from one another; and, moreover, it is proper, where no emergency exists, to press for improvement with moderation and judgment. In some hospitals, windows or glazed doors still remain a want, and in these, on occasions of cold wind or rain, when the doors are shut, the patients must, for the time being, remain in almost total darkness. Here and there also accommodation, according to the authorized scale, has not been provided for the medical subordinates and hospital establishment, but the representations made regarding them will no doubt be acted on. Recruits. 46. In some regiments, the recruits were considered by the administrative medical officers who inspected them to have been judiciously selected, while in others (particularly in the Rawal Pindi Circle) a rather large proportion of them were reported to be either of inferior physique or too old. Instruction of Duffadars in 16th Bengal Cavalry in some details of minor surgery. 47. Dr. Tuson has instructed some of the duffadars of his regiment, the 16th Bengal Cavalry, in the details of minor surgery; he considers that they are quite competent to detect and put up a fracture on an emergency, when the services of a medical officer or subordinate might not be available; they are also said to be acquainted with the various means for controlling hæmorrhage, and may, on field service, be turned to very good account. Dr. Tuson reports that the duffadars were most willing to learn, and that in this undertaking he received the entire approval and co-operation of his
XV commanding officer. This idea has originated with the Surgeon-Major, and may perhaps commend itself to other medical officers who might thus usefully occupy a portion of their own leisure and reap solid advantages from the assistance, in actual operations in war, of the men to whom they had imparted the instruction. 48.

Medical officers do not seem to be quite agreed as to the etiology of the pneumonia which generally proves so fatal along the Punjab frontier, but it will be gathered from paragraphs 36 and 37 that cold, acting on men insufficiently clothed when off duty, is most probably the exciting cause of pneumonia and other chest affections which, with the exception of pleuritis, were in excess of the numbers recorded in 1874.

Such a large number of patients continuing in this condition without improvement, caused further enquiries to be made concerning the nature of food in use, and checks were introduced in order to ascertain the nature and quantity of food brought into hospital. It was found that patients for whom certain articles of food were ordered, and for whom advances were obtained, did not purchase the articles considered necessary for them, but retained the money for other purposes. After this discovery, any extra dieting in hospital was taken entirely out of the hands of the patients, and each man was furnished with his extra diet in the form of a ration. A considerable improvement followed on this, and the numbers in hospital rapidly diminished. A very large number of men in the regiment have, however, got their constitutions so irretrievably damaged, that it is questionable if ever they will become fit again for military service, and this is most notably the case among the recruits. X. Clothing.8 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BENGAL. The only tangible cause operating to produce such a high sick and mortality rate in the past year, was that detailed in paragraph IX . Probably some unknown causes may have been in operation in the production of so much sickness, as also mental depression. All the men in the regiment suffered from extreme depression mentally, and a large number of them were very anxious to leave the regiment, not caring to have further service in Bengal. The only conclusion I can arrive at is, that much, if not the greater proportion, of the sickness was due to malarial poison acting on men in a weak bodily condition and suffering from great mental depression. What I think supports this view is the fact, that the poor and badly nourished inhabi- tants of the district suffered in the same manner as the sepoys of the regiment. Principal causes of sickness.

He reports that the lines were the same as those occupied by the regiment in 1874; one-half of the barracks and huts were kept in a fair state of repair, but the other half were in a dilapidated and leaky condition, and were not repaired until towards the latter end of the rains: there was no overcrowd- ing of the men in the barracks or huts. Tank water had been used for drinking and cooking purposes until the month of April, when the Calcutta municipal water was laid to the lines, and was apparently duly appreciated by all who used it. water-supply. The drainage, conservancy, and latrines are reported to have been in a satisfactory condition. Drainage, &c. The hospital afforded good accommodation for 119 sick; and when this number was exceeded, the patients were treated in tents pitched in the com- pound; all the hospital arrangements were satisfactory, and. the medicines and instruments were carefully kept. Hospital. On the morning of his inspection, Mr. Cockburn inspected all the men of the regiment who were off duty, and they were considered by him to be, as a rule, sickly looking and badly nourished; and four-fifths of the men in hospital were found to have more or less enlargement of the spleen, and a large propor- tion also were suffering from scorbutic symptoms. The excessive amount of sickness during the year was chiefly due to malarious poisoning, accompanied by a scorbutic taint, due, no doubt, to the want of a sufficiently varied dietary, and to abstention from fresh vegetable food; the general debility and emaciation of the men went on increasing to such an extent, that in July last the medical officer found it necessary to recommend a reduction. in the numbers of parades, which were accordingly reduced to one a week for sepoys, and one daily for recruits, but without any beneficial result; and eventually it became necessary to relieve the men from all duties which could be dispensed with. At this time, 50 per cent. of the men Were in hospital, where they were treated with lime juice, stimulants, quinine, and a diet roll was introduced, by means of which each man's daily food consumed was carefully scrutinized. under this system, a marked improvement in the health of the men became visible, and the Deputy Surgeon-General entirely agrees with the opinion expressed by Surgeon Duncan, that a large proportion of the sickness was due to malarial influences acting on men in a low state of bodily health, consequent on a deficient and badly regulated diet, and one in which the anti-scorbutic elements of food were markedly absent.

During the year 1875, the 10th Regiment Native Infantry stationed at Barrackpore supplied this detachment of an average strength of 111 men, and the men were located in sheds formerly used by the Artillery, which afforded them very fair and ample accommodation.

Conolly, Her Majesty's 40th Regiment, and Station Staff Surgeon, was in charge of this detachment.

M., it is believed that some of the men do not use it, but draw their water-supply from tanks. The "trench system" of latrine with movable screens is in use, and is reported on as working well, and as free from any offensive smell.

The water is stated to be of good quality and abundant, is Considered to be free from any organic contamination, but contains a large quantity of lime. Food. Throughout the year the supply of food of good quality was abundant, and no case of under-feeding has been noticed by the medical officer. Clothing. The clothing is described as being well suited to the climate, and to the duties the men have to perform. Boots. As reported last year, the men wear boots of the ammunition pattern, these boots are of native manufacture, and are much too heavy; they also fit badly, and in this way cause foot sores, thus rendering many men ineffi- cient. On this point Mr. Palmer thus expresses himself: "I am of opinion that the boot is quite unsuited for the native soldier, who cannot afford to buy socks." Clothing of recruits. The recruits on joining are provided with a warm coat, and both recruits and sepoys are obliged to provide themselves with good warm rezais; the medical officer considers the head dress to be neither ornamental nor useful, as it leaves the most important part of the head quite unprotected. Duty. The duty during the year consisted of the ordinary drills and parades, and was not excessive. The number of nights in bed is not stated. Marches. Beyond the marches made by the right wing to Nya Doomka, and by a detachment to Bankipore, the regiment did not move during the year. Hospital. The hospital has been previously described, and is now reported on as being in good repair and affording ample accommodation for the sick of the regiment under ordinary circumstances.

This defect in the latrines is owing to the cantonment funds which will not admit of a larger supply of screens. Hospital. A new hospital on the standard plan is in course of construction, and is much needed, as the present buildings can only afford very inferior accom- madation for 26 patients. The servants' houses at the hospital were not in a satisfactory condition, as they were not in the list of buildings to be kept in repair by the Department Public Works. Physique. Cholera The physique and general health of the men were excellent, and the recruits appeared to have been judiciously selected. On the occasion of Dr. Walker's first inspection, there were two cases of cholera under treatment, and the entire regiment was ordered out into camp in consequence. All the hospital details for the care and treatment of the sick were in good working order. Detachment, 13th Regi- ment Native Infantry, at Berhampore.

He reports that the lines were as usual very clean; trees which were planted in 1874 were growing nicely; nearly all the streets had stone-paved drains, which in a great measure removes the great defect in all the other regimental lines in his circle, viz ., the soakage of the sewage from the court- yards into the ground; these drains were swept twice daily, and were flushed by hand twice a week. The drainage was very good; conservancy well carried out. There were latrines which were mat enclosures, and one was placed on the flank of each line. Foot sores were pretty frequent, and were caused by ill-fitting boots.

There has been no unusual outbreak of sickness, except cholera. A troublesome and rather obstinate ulcer, appearing chiefly at the ankle or heel, attacked some 15 or 16 of the men during the rainy season. In most instances the ulcer seemed to originate from a boot or shoe rub, or abrasion from accident on parade or otherwise. In some few no apparent cause could be traced. The ulcer of circular form and elevated edges, with a flabby, unhealthy centre, was difficult to manage; strapping, blisters, and stimulating applications were in turn tried, and all, in some few cases, seemed to fail; for the cases lingered on until the regiment marched towards Lucknow, when the change of air acted most beneficially. The mortality in the whole regiment during the past year has been very low, only one case of death, and that one from cholera in hospital. Seventeen men were invalided. Cholera. XVI.

Two enclosed verandahs on either side of the ward, each 113'×10'×11' mean height, superficial area 1,130, cubic space 12,430. They are separated from the ward by kutcha walls 15 feet high, reaching to the roof, and each communicates with the ward by 15 archways, 8 of which on both sides are closed by a wall reaching to a height of 5 feet from the floor. They each communicate with the external air by seven latticed doors 7' 3"×4' 6" placed opposite to the seven open archways. A portion of each end of the hospital is allotted to entrances, offices and store-rooms; at the northern end are two rooms (10'×10'), in one, hospital bedding and necessaries are kept, in the other, firewood and old timber. At the southern end are two rooms (10'×10'), one used as an office-room, the other for dispensing medicines in. One end of the left-hand side verandah has been walled off for use as a bath-room. The ward contains 30 beds; the verandah could be used as wards on an emergency, and would be capable of holding 15 beds each.

Notwithstanding it is capable of further improvement, proper lines would reduce the percentage and prevent a considerable loss of service. Principal causes of sick- ness. Principal causes of sickness .RAJPOOTANA. 65 for instance, lithotomy is done by the chumars, something after the old way of "cutting on the gripe", the calculus being squeezed out through the incision or extracted by a hook, and is said to be very successful especially in children. Dr. Moore, in a number of the Indian Annals for 1873, shows how they tear away the tunica vaginalis in hydrocele. The actual cautery seems a panacea for almost every disease. I have seen subjects mottled by the scars from it. In one instance it was applied in an infant for congenital hernia. They bear operations extremely well. In one case of comminuted compound fracture of the femur involving the knee joint, the frag- ments, according to Stromeyer's recommendation, were allowed to remain with good result; in another case, after extracting the eye I was obliged to remove a great part of the orbital plate of the frontal bone and portions of the bones forming the internal angle of the orbit on account of malignant growth, and the patient made an uninterrupted recovery. With a little assistance, a useful dispensary could be established, as the district is far removed from European aid. The above remarks will not be considered inappropriate to the present report when it is taken into consideration that the corps being principally local in every way, its health is conditioned and influenced to a considerable degree by the same causes which affect the civil population. The Cavalry is recruited from the Punjab, nearly all being Sikhs, with a few Musalmans. The Infantry is almost entirely drawn from the aborigines with a few Rajpoots and Poorbeas. Thirty-three recruits were entertained in 1875, all eligible and fair specimens of their respective races. CENTRAL INDIA.

CENTRAL INDIA. 67 commenting upon the practice of treating slight cases as line sick, and the inaccuracy thereby caused on the statistics, he proceeds in an elaborate table to add all the out-patients of previous years to the number returned as sick in hospital, and deduces therefrom that the regiment, far from having been, as a rule, one of the most healthy in India, has stood high in the order of unhealthiness, with the practical corollary that the existing hospital accommoda- tion is utterly inadequate, and must be trebled or quadrupled in order to become sufficient. Central India has always been reported a healthy country, and that Surgeon Edis's inferences to the contrary are incorrect, is, I think, proved by this year's returns. It does not appear to have been an unusually healthy year, save that there was, perhaps, less fever than usual after the rains; yet, as shewn by the following extension of Mr. Edis's table, though the average number of daily sick in hospital has been nearly doubled by the admission of cases which would formerly have been treated as out-patients, the total number of men treated has been much smaller than in any previous year.

The generally trivial nature of very many of the cases is shown by the fact that 5 cases spent only one day, 24 two, 34 three, and 28 four days in hospital; by the absence of any fatal case, and by the fact that only three cases were severe enough to require to be detailed in the case book; and I think I am entitled to say that the climate of Central India is sufficiently vindicated, and that the 1st Central India Horse has been singularly healthy during the year under review, as it has always been since I joined it in 1872.

He was taken into hospital there, where he remained about three weeks, and eventually they sent him on here. When he arrived, about one month after the receipt of the injury, his leg was in a dreadful state, the knee-joint being full of pus. Amputation was performed at middle third of thigh on 9th June; the stump did well at first, but about three weeks after the operation, the bone became diseased, and sinases formed in every direction. A second operation was performed on 26th July, and the femur removed from just below the trochanters. The man remained in a very critical state for many days, as deep and extensive sloughing occurred in the stump, but he eventually made a good recovery. Inspection.

Hospital. XIV. Hospital .CENTRAL INDIA. 75 I will content myself with noting here that guinea-worm, as heretofore (though only tak- ing about the third place as regards the number of admissions), from the tedious nature of the processes by which the worm is gradually extracted, and the extensive suppuration which it almost invariably excites, contributes a large share of the number of days in hospital. For example, during the past year the total number of days in hospital for 414 total treated has been 3,759; whilst the total number for 52 treated for guinea-worn was 677, much less, however, than the usual average. A free use of the knife would, in many cases, very much accelerate the progress of the disease; but the Bheel sepoy has so great a dislike to " cold steel" in the form of surgery, that one of my predecessors, finding that the men were beginning to desert rather than go to hospital, was obliged to revert to the old " expectant" system of treatment. Their dislike to operative surgery is clearly evidenced by the statistics of the little dispensary at Khairwara, in which no more than two or three capital operations are performed in any one year; though it is so popular in other respects, that the number of new cases treated during 1875 by far exceed the total population of the station. The causation of guinea-worm has been touched on by me in connection with the water-supply in my return for 1874, and I have no original information now to communicate. For the great difference between the statistics of disease at head-quarters, and those of the Kotra detachment, I would also refer to my return for the past year (1874), as well as to suggest that the greater rain-fall of the latter place may be, more or less, responsible for the greater prevalence of fevers, rheumatism and chest diseases.

Meteorology and climate .CENTRAL INDIA. 77 The circumstances of the corps remaining the same, the causes to which disease is ascribable remain as described in the report for 1874. From the above tabular statement it will be seen that the rate per cent of admissions has been considerably higher for 1875 than for 1874 and the average of the five immediately preceding years; this increase is most marked in the case of fevers and conjunctivitis. I believe it is not due to the year being exceptionally unhealthy, but is in consequence of the amount of fatigue duty causing men to report themselves sick for slight ailments who would not otherwise have come to hospital. It will be seen that the daily average number of sick per cent of strength at head-quarters is only a small fraction over the average. There has not been a single admission for syphilis or other venereal affection throughout the year. Nine men were invalided for discharge, eight on account of general debility, generally the result of age, and one for obesity, rendering him unfit for active duty. XVll.

Governor General; the particulars of this outbreak will, no doubt, be given with greater accu- racy than I can give them by the Indore Residency Surgeon, under whose notice it came, the detachment being in medical charge of an hospital assistant. It appears that the detach- -ment was encamped on what is said to have been a very dirty piece of ground, running near which was a nullah, the water of which was drunk by the men, and which, there is reason to believe, was contaminated by sewage matter. The first case was attacked on the evening of the 6th November, and died on the morning of the 7th. On this latter date three more cases occurred and one death. The camp was moved a few miles out of Indore, on the Sehore road. On the 8th two more cases occurred, and the camp made another move. On the 9th the seventh and last case occurred, and one death, and two more deaths took place on the 10th and 12th, respectively. The detachment returned to Indore, performed the duty for which it was sent there, and returned to Sehore on 19th November, in good health. Vaccination. XIX.

A strong proof that the state of the atmosphere was the great determining cause of the spread of the disease is to be found in the fact that in both visitations it appeared and dis- appeared from the city of Lucknow pretty much about the same time as it did amongst the troops, whether the latter were in camp or cantonments. The reason, I believe, why the mortality is greatest in the early part of most èpidemics is not merely the greater number of persons susceptible of attack, but that the systems of those who have survived the first onset have had time to adapt themselves to the altered condition of atmosphere, and hence they are not again exposed to so rude a shock. That this law obtains in epidemics of other diseases as well as cholera, is, to my mind, a proof of how much atmospheric changes have to do with their prevalence. If there be any truth in the views here expressed, as we cannot expect to alter materially the state of the atmosphere during cholera epidemics, it is evident that our main hope in the way of prevention must be in the improved sanitary condition of the people, as regards local surroundings, habits and mode of life, and the temporary removal from the area in which the disease is prevailing of those whose vital condition from any cause is depressed.

During the time the epidemic of cholera was prevalent, the men were prohibited from going to any of the bazars or any place else from which reports of the existence of the disease had been received. The detachments of the regiment on their return from escort duty with any of the European cholera camps were put into tents pitched some distance from the lines, and were thus kept in quarantine for a full period of seven days before they were allowed to rejoin. XIX. Vaccination.92 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BENGAL. Statistics. During 1875, 569 prostitutes were borne on the register, and the daily number of in-door patients for the year was 49.19, or at the rate of 8.64 per cent. of those registered. The Deputy Surgeon-General reports that everything in connection with the management and establishment was in good order, and the periodical examination of the prostitutes was most carefully conducted. It seems that a question had been raised by the Local Government as to whether, since the abolition of the practice of taking fees from the registered women in August last, the institution is of sufficient importance in arresting the spread of venereal disease among the civil population for the municipality to incur the entire expense of keeping it up. On this point the Deputy Surgeon- General thus expresses himself: "We spend thousands on drainage and con- servancy and other sanitary arrangements, and why should not the municipality spend some of its money in treating and arresting one of the most loathsome and formidable diseases that can be spread amongst any community ?"

It is also a check to men under-feeding themselves, as a kind of caterer is appointed by themselves who charges each member of the mess an equal share of the expenses. The cooks are of the caste of the men composing the troop. The above arrangement was only rendered possible by the men of the regiment having been re-distributed in their troops, each class being in its own troop: viz., 1st and 2nd troops are Hindoo-Mahomedans, 3rd, Northern men, 4th, Hindoos, and 5th and 6th, Sikhs.

The disease passed through the stages of collapse, with suppression of urine, and re-action, and terminated fatally by secondary fever and uræmic poisoning. The next case among the men occurred on the 15th; the attack also commencing in the early morning, and passing rapidly into collapse, from which there was no rally, death taking place in 8 hours after admission. From the 12th to the 21st September, 9 cases occurred among the camp-followers of the regiment, and of these, 3 died and 6 re- covered. They were treated by the Staff Surgeon in a temporary hut erected for the emergency. Most of these cases, including the two sowars who died, having occurred in the 6th troop, this troop was placed in tents on the neighbouring maidan, and its lines thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. Altogether, throughout the outbreak, 1,023 deaths took place in the city and district of Meerut, 15 admissions with 10 deaths occurred in the Artillery, 2 admissions in the 15th Hussars, 1 admission in the 85th Regiment, and 11 admissions with 5 deaths in the 4th Bengal Cavalry. The 5th Native Infantry had a complete immunity, no case having occurred in this regiment.

Under these circumstances, I recommended to the commanding officer, that as there was no probability of the new hospital being ready for occupation for at least another year, that a temporary hospital should he built in the new cantonment, and when completed, that we should desert the Dehra hospital entirely; so that in case of future epidemics, all communication with Dehra could be completely shut off. A site was selected between the bazaar and lines. The matter met with the approval of the commanding officer and the Deputy Surgeon-General of the circle, and the building was commenced in June; but on account of the rains it was not completed till the beginning of the cold weather, and then was not considered quite dry enough to be safely occupied. This hospital consists of two long wards, and a verandah all round. It is built on a raised plinth of about 2 feet; mud walls and thatched roof, one end verandah being divided off at the corners for a dispensary and office: a room will be required for the hos- pital assistants. It is calculated that sufficient accommodation will be given for the usual number of sick. The ventilation is good, and it will be much cooler than the old Dehra hos- pital, whose floor and walls must be saturated with impure exhalations of forty years' occupancy. On the return of the regiment to the Doon, the sick will be moved into this building, and on the completion of the Government building, it will be used as the hospital for the women and child- ren of the regiment. The hospital accommodation then for the whole regiment will be most perfect. Its vicinity to the Government hospital new building, will enable the hospital assist- ants to attend to the patients in it with little extra trouble, and its nearness to the lines will be a great inducement for the families to reside in it when really ill. The great distance of the old hospital in Dehra, almost shuts off the families from applying for aid, as they could not afford the time to go to and fro and leave their cooking and domestic affairs in the lines. All will be now changed. New hospital clothing has been provided regimentally, and all the char- poys have been condemned and replaced by new ones. The bath-room is regularly used by the patients. The hospital has been whitewashed inside and out during the year, and also after the cholera epidemic, and the building is in as good repair as its nature admits of.

The remaining four cases were not in any way attributable to camp influences. One case of pneumonia proved fatal in the regimental hospital tent; the man having become too ill to be moved after the general hospital was ready for the reception of patients. For slight ailments, such as blisters of the feet, the men were not admitted into hospital, but were employed on light duties in the camp, while under treatment. Eleven cases were transferred to the general hospital; and 7 of them were still under treatment at the end of the year. Pneumonia. XIV.

Leprosy. treatment as practised by Dr. Dougall. Ram Chunder Khundka, Naik, H Company, 3rd Goorkhas, was admitted into hospital on the 25th March. He complained of numbness and impaired sensation of the fingers and toes, also of the skin covering the prominences of the cheek bones, and lobes of the ears, which were also indurated and thickened. The color of the skin all over the body is peculiar: it is of a purple hue, and has a coarse, wrinkled, glassy appearance, especially where exposed to the air. He commenced the treatment at about the end of March last. The gurjun oil and lime-water, in the proportion of 1 to 3, was rubbed over the whole body in the morning, and a dose of 1 drachm gurjun oil to 1 drachm of castor oil was taken internally. In the evening the same dose was administered internally, while a bath of soap and water was taken. This treatment was continued pretty steadily for nearly 4 months, at the end of which time not only had sensation been completely restored, but the induration of the skin covering the cheek bones and lobes of the ears had almost disappeared. In order to give the patient the full benefit of' all advantages in favour of permanent cure after this course of treatment, I recommended him change of air, and sent him to his home in Nepaul, and upon his return his former symptoms have in no way returned; it is to be hoped the cure is a permanent one. This case shall be watched and reported upon again, as, should the cure remain permanent, it cannot but be one of the deepest interest to the profession, as con- firming the value of Dr. Dougall's treatment of leprosy when employed in the early stage of that disease.

After a heavy rainfall the surface water occasionally stands for some time before it can run off, but he considers the drainage to be generally good. Two kinds of latrine were in use, viz., the "trench system" with matting screens and trench, and the trench method by means of the movable box on wheels. The ground is subsequently ploughed up and cultivated. The hospital is built on the standard plan, and affords ample accommo- dation for 24 men in the main wards, and for as many more, if necessary, in the verandahs.

The length of the hospital is 175 feet, width 45, and the height 20 feet; it contains 57 beds and affords to 57 inmates, 2,763 cubic and 138 superficial feet per man; there are 57 cots, or over 8 per cent. The size of the cots is satisfactory. Ventilation is efficiently carried out; numerous doorways exist, which have good doors. The out-offices are scanty in accommodation; they consist of seven rooms for hospital establishment, two cook-rooms, and one privy; the cooking houses are used as dwell- ings for the hospital assistants, as no houses for the latter exist here. A cook-room is impro- vised out of one of the servants' houses. The state of repair of the hospital and out-offices is good; the site is desirable, with the exception that a deep nullah intervenes between it (the hospital) and the lines; in the rains all transit to and from the lines takes place over a wooden bridge; the hospital is also half a mile from the lines. There has been no overcrowding in the hospital, the building is sufficiently warm and well lighted, and the bedding, clothing, &c., is quite suitable. When, in the opinion of the medical officer, a man coming into hospital has not suffi- cient clothing, a suitable supply is immediately obtained for him through the orderly officer of the day. XV.

On the 16th July 1875, Surgeon-Major Raddock recommended to the Cantonment Ma- gistrate that the ground within 200 yards of the hospital should not be broken up for cul- tivation. The recommendation was attended to. Cutting of grass and grazing of bullocks close to the hospital. On the 28th September 1875, I recommended to the officer commanding Her Majesty's 32nd Pioneers that grass should not be cut in the immediate vicinity of the hospital, and that bullocks should not be allowed to graze too close to the building, as they both disturbed the patients and seriously damaged the young trees which were planted near the hospital. Orders were issued and the necessary steps taken. Defects still existing.137 SIRHIND DIVISION. Station Staff Hospital, Umballa.138 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BENGAL.

The bed of kunkur, which interferes with the sub-soil drainage, is usually considered to be the main cause of the excessive unhealthiness of Meean Meer. Extensive drains are now being made in the European lines through the kunkur; it remains to be seen whether they will effect the object they are being made for. The regiment marched for the Camp of Exercise at Delhi early in No- vember, and arrived there on the 6th December, remaining until the end of the year. The huts at Meean Meer are stated to have been badly ventilated; the drainage is said to be imperfect; the water-supply was from wells, but was dis- liked by the men, being brackish; the supply of food was abundant.

The two next cases proving fatal were (1) a lad of 17 that had been rejected as unfit to be enlisted as a sepoy on account of badly formed chest, but subsequently passed as a bugler, died of double pneumonia on the sixth day; and (2) a very severe case of acute pleurisy, with rapid and extensive effusion of lymph and semi-purulent matter in both pleural cavities. The 4th case that proved fatal was that of a sepoy who had been sent before the Invaliding Committee of 1874 on account of old standing rheumatic affection of the knee with large exostosis from the head of tibia; was rejected and remained 12 months subsequently in hospital; was passed by the Committee of 1875. Immediately on return from Meean Meer he returned to hospital and died of prostration five days after. The 5th case was one purely of Terai fever in a recruit of 18, just joined the regiment, death being result of prostration from persistent recurrences of the paroxysm in spite of treatment. The 6th case was that of a man admitted to hospital in 1873 for scrofula. During the two years he had been in hospital he never became in a condition that would permit of his discharge, and for humanity's sake he had been retained in hospital during his life-time without hope of his recovery, or even of improvement in his condition. Prior to death, the mesenteric glands could be felt beneath the abdominal paricles, each as large as a large clenched fist. XVIII. Epidemics.158 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BENGAL. Topography. Lines. Drainage. Conservancy. Water-supply Diet. Clothing. Duties. A topographical description of the station has been formerly given. Dr. Watson describes the rainfall as having been above the average, and unevenly distributed; very heavy falls late in the season produced floods such as were not known for years. He does not look on Rawal Pindi as a malarious station, but considers that the mild form of autumnal fever met with is dependent more or less on the vicissitudes of temperature acting on constitu- tions already saturated with the materies morbi. The lines are said to have been in a fair state of repair and clean. The ventilation was not considered as good as it might have been; but as there was no overcrowding, the medical officer does not think the men suffered in consequence. The natural drainage in and around the lines is very good: the drains were frequently cleaned out, and no water lay stagnant at any time. The "dry-earth" system was carried out in the latrines, the walls of which were in a dilapidated state. The conservancy of the latrines was not what it should have been, as the medical officer reports that the "floor has become saturated with urine, and is somewhat offensive." Many of the men, too, preferred to resort to the nullas in the neighbourhood for necessary purposes. The water-supply was from wells, and was abundant and of good quality. The various articles of food have been uniformly good, plentiful and cheap, and the bazaar has been clean and well ordered. The Jâts in this regiment have messes of their own, and live well. They partake liberally of milk, vegetables, and many of them use flesh of all kinds, with the exception of beef: they also indulge in stimulants in moderation, rum being their favorite liquor. In consequence of the way they live, the men are in a high state of physical development, and under- feeding has been unknown. The clothing is of the same kind as formerly described, and is well adapted to the climate and duties the men have to perform. The duties were in no way excessive, and the men had from 6 to 10 nights in 11. Hospital. XIV. Hospital .RAWAL PINDI DIVISION. 159 XVII.

All the cases, with few exceptions, yielded easily to treatment, and no bad effects were left afterwards. I have been much struck with the marked improvement in the general health of the men and how much more rapidly they recover now than when in Peshawar, and this will be shown by the great diminution in the numbers admitted under "debility," and those who were so admitted Were chiefly old soldiers who had suffered from repeated attacks of fever during their service; but even among these men, rest for a short time in hospital with general tonic treatment soon enabled them to recover their health, and the fact that only one man required sick leave during the year will of itself speak for the general health of the corps.

Principal causes of mortality.166 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BENGAL. The year, on the whole, has been a healthy one; and though the returns show an increase in the number of admissions over 1874 of 134, the cases have for the most part been slight and of short duration, and the health of the regiment has really been better. The increase over last year is due principally to a larger number of cases of intermittent fever, which disease during September, October and November, was very prevalent, but a few cases excepted, of no severity and uncomplicated, a marked feature being the absence of pneumonic complication, in former years so noticeable and so fatal. The average daily sick has been nearly the same, viz., 14.27, as against 13.12 of 1874, and would have been less but for the detachment at Attock, whose percentage of admissions rose to 213.93 against a percentage at head-quarters of 118.16 during the same period. Last year only four deaths occurred, and this year the mortality is even smaller, viz., 3, of which number one man died in hospital and two out. Twenty-two men were invalided in 1875 against 34 of previous year. Principal causes of sickness. XVI. Principal causes of sickness.

The English pattern boot was worn on all duties at the camp, and the number of cases ad mitted for foot-bite was comparatively small; but with respect to this point, it needs be stated that only such lesions as actually disabled from duty were received into hospital, the milder cases being disposed of by giving the sufferers a few days rest in the lines till they were reported fit for duty by the native officers, and as regards these no estimate can be formed. Before commencing the march from Talagang in carrying out the annual relief, Colonel Ruggles caused the young men to go through a preliminary seasoning of their feet by wearing the ammunition boot on all duties for several weeks.

Mr. Banister states that everything was in perfect order. There were no deficiencies among the supplies, and the patients, 12 in number, were receiving every possible attention. The out-offices afforded very good accommodation for the whole of the establishment. The recruits, 22 in num- ber, were all considered to be more or less eligible. This regiment left for Umballa in October, in course of relief, after a residence of four years at Nowshera. The men were not, perhaps, so strong and vigorous as they were on their first arrival, but they were certainly in average health. 27th (Punjab) Regiment, Native Infantry192 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BENGAL. south. The drainage is entirely surface, and there being a gentle slope towards the north and west, there is no lodging of water after rain. The huts are built of mud, well "leeped;" they have flat roofs; their capacity is 11,799 cubic feet, and they are kept in excellent repair. On account of so many men being constantly absent, and a considerable number more being occa- sionally absent, there is no possibility of overcrowding. Drainage. VI.

The latrine, in which the dry-earth system is enforced, is situated to the south of it, and the excreta are carried away in a conservancy cart twice daily. The hospital is a pucka building, made of stone and brick, and the roof is tiled. Its extreme length outside 175 feet, breadth 43 feet 6 inches; at each corner is a small ward. 12 feet x 12 feet, used respectively as (1), an office; (2), the dispensary; (3), the ablution-room; (4), a store-room. There are two verandahs, one on the east side and one on the west, 8 feet wide, which run nearly the whole length of the building, being bounded at either end by the small wards just mentioned. The wards for the reception of the patients are two in number, slightly unequal in size, one being 78 feet x 20 feet, the other 72 feet x 20 feet, the larger being intended to accommodate 26 patients, the smaller 24 patients (total 50 patients). They communicate by an arched doorway about 10 feet high. There is a separate building, in which are two distinct wards, also to the south of the hospital (the latrine being between them), which is intended for the reception of such cases as it might be advisable to treat apart from the other patients; and a dead-house is in course of construction. The quarters for the hospital assistants and medical pupils and for the hospital establishment are on the west side of the hospital, about 20 yards distant, and the cook-houses are facing the north end. The capacity of the larger ward is 26,910 cubic feet, and that of the smaller is 24,840 cubic feet, total 51,750 cubic feet, which would give to each man, supposing the entire hospital to be occupied, 924 cubic feet. The ventilation could hardly be improved upon, there being in the length of the two wards 12 doors and 14 windows, besides a door at each end. The 12 doors and 14 windows can be closed or opened at will, and when all are closed there is abundance of light, for all the windows are glazed. The building is in very good repair, but it is not able to keep out heavy and continued rain. It has been a little shaken by the recent earthquakes; but I do not think that it leaks more in consequence. I think the warming arrangements are not good, consisting merely of a small iron stove in each ward, which throws out but little heat and is not of much use; but I believe that fire-places will soon be substituted for the stoves. The sepoys bring their own bedding with them, and are always well supplied; but there is some difficulty about the recruits, for in truth they have very little clothing, as a rule, when they join the regiment. There has been, I am very glad to say, no overcrowding in the hospital during the year. The maximum number of patients who were under treatment on any one day was 36, and no case required to be segregated during the year under consider- ation. XV.

The number of cases of fever of all kinds admitted this year falls nearly 50 short of the number admitted in 1874. This may be due possibly to the greater healthiness of Kohat over Edwardesabad, where the regiment was stationed in 1874, and to the removal of the regiment from the frontier during the last three months of the year.

There was an increase of bowel complaints, which chiefly occurred in the detachment employed in the Duffla Expedition. There were 92 cases of blistered feet; but the medical officer observes that from the peculiar urgency with which the Naga Expedition was conducted, with continued forced marches in the plains at an advanced period of the year, blistered feet were inevitable.

There are several old men in the regiment getting near their full service, and there are also a few young and weakly men who have not quite sufficient service to entitle them to any pension. Of the four men sent on sick leave, three died. I have now almost set my face against granting sick leave from this station; the difficulties of the journey to Calcutta are too great for a man in a weak state even with a man to attend him.

APPENDIX. Medical history of the 1st Goorkha Light Infantry while employed on service in the Malay Peninsula, from the 26th of November 1875 to the 31st of March 1876. BY SURGEON-MAJOR C. F. OLDHAM, IN MEDICAL CHARGE OF THE REGIMENT. European officers 10 Native officers 10 Non-commissioned officers and sepoys 457 TOTAL 477 1. The regiment, of the strength marginally noted, left Dhurmsala on 30th October en route for the camp of exercise at Delhi. At Umballa, on 16th November, orders were received to prepare for foreign service and to proceed at once by rail to Calcutta. Steps were immediately taken to weed out sick and weakly men, and to make up the hospital establishment to its full strength, a portion having been left behind with the regimental depôt. The regiment reached Calcutta on 20th November, and was encamped on the glacis of Fort William. Strength. 2. The men received a free kit consisting of266 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BENGAL. Medical arrangements. Arrival at Malacca. One hundred men despatch- ed to Rassa. Lieutenant-Colonel Story's party, I detailed a hospital assistant. There were several medical officers with the European portion of the force, of which this detachment formed a part. On 8th December, the Malda reached Malacca, which was found to be in no apparent danger: but as it was feared that a small detachment of Her Majesty's 10th Foot, at Rassa, in the adjoining State of Sungie Yujong, would be overpowered, the force was ordered to proceed at once to its relief. A detachment of 100 men of 1st Goorkhas, under Captain Rankin, remained at Malacca, and with them I left Surgeon Bomford and a medical pupil. The same night the remainder of the force sailed in the Malda for the mouth of the Lukut river, some 30 miles north of Malacca. In the morning, 100 men were despatched under Lieutenant-Colonel Hill, by river 2 miles and jungle-path 16 miles, to Rassa. As coolies were not available, this party took nothing but their arms and ammunition, and, at my recommendation, their water-proof sheets. They reached Rassa the same night, after a severe march. Advance up the Lukut river. Next morning, a number of coolies having been collected, the rest of the troops, with the smallest possible quantity of baggage, left the Malda in boats, which were towed by a small steamer up the Lukut river. This stream is about 150 yards wide at the month, but narrow above, and is only navigable as far as LukutaAPPENDIX268 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BENGAL. with a gun and rocket boat, went up the river in support. The force advanced through alter- nate paddy fields and forest to Ingha, where some shots were fired by the enemy, who were hidden in gardens; a number of them, however, being seen from the gun-boats, some shells and rockets were sent amongst them, when they disappeared. The village was fired, and the force bivouacked in the neighbourhood. The night was very damp and chilly, with a very heavy dew, and a thick fog enveloped the place in the morning. Many cases of dysentery and fever were the result of this night's exposure. March to Prek and its de- struction. Next morning, leaving 50 men at Ingha, the remainder of the force marched to Prek. About half way, Where the path wound round the foot of a forest covered hill, we were received with a volley by the enemy, who were concealed in the thick jungle only a few yards off. Fortunately, little harm was done. Lieutenant-Colonel Hill was struck by a bullet on the leg, but it did not penetrate his gaiter; and one of the sepoys had his rifle sling shot through, while another bullet struck his pouch and flattened itself amongst his ammunition. A party was at once sent into the jungle, and the enemy retreated, firing a few shots as they went. At Prek there was a slight resistance, but no casualty. The village was destroyed, and the troops returned to Qualla Kangsa. Increase in temperature. Nostalgia Rain fall. The heat now became much greater. Little or no rain had fallen for three weeks. The Perak fell rapidly, till it became easily fordable. The maximum thermometer showed 96°-97°F. in the Officers' bungalows, and in the sun 135°F. and upwards. Dysentery and fevers were very prevalent. Nostalgia now began to affect the sepoys, and was increased by rumours that the regiment was to be kept in the country for another year. The men made no com- plaints but fell into low spirits, and fancied they should all die away from home. At last, on 25th February, rain fell, and from that time heavy showers occurred every evening. The heat became less trying, and the thermometer fell to 93°F. and soon after to 91°F.; the sick- ness then rapidly diminished. Orders to return to India, and embarkation of the force. 23. On 8th March, orders were received for the troops to return to India, and I was directed to proceed with all the native sick on board the transport Czarewitch lying off the Larut river. Wounds 1 Fevers 21 Dysentery 20 Boils, &c. 1 Other diseases 12 TOTAL 55 On 10th, I embarked with 55 sick, as per margin. On 19th, the whole force having embarked on board the steam ships Himalayah and Arabia and the store ship Czarewitch, sailed for India. On the voyage most of the sick improved, but sea-sickness interfered very much with their recovery, by preventing the weakly men from gaining strength. On 21st March a sepoy died of chronic dysentery and was buried at sea. On 31st the sick, immediately on their arrival in Calcutta, were sent off by rail from Howrah. After landing, almost all the sick, and weakly men rapidly recovered their health; but several cases of fever occurred during the journey, especially at Meerut, where the night was very chilly. On the march from Jullundur to Dhurmsala heavy rain fell, and several cases of fever and dysentery, and one of pneumonia, were the result. On 15th April the regiment reached Dhurmsala. Since their return to India, several of the men who suffered from fever and dysentery in the Malay Peninsula, have had a return of these complaints; and some, who were well throughout the compaign, have since been attacked by these diseases. Good results from the expe- dition being formed in the healthiest season of the year. 24. It was most fortunate that the operations commenced at the best and healthiest time of the year. The troops landed in Sungie Yujong on 10th December, and in Perak a few days earlier. The weather was then at its coolest, showers occurred daily, and the sky was fre- quently cloudy for the greater part of the twenty-four hours. The atmosphere was almost satu- rated with moisture, and violent exercise caused profuse perspiration; but when cloudy it was possible to march considerable distances without exhaustion. Not only was there very little sickness, but the wounded men, both of Her Majesty's 10th Foot and of the Arab auxiliaries, made unusually good recoveries. When the sun was not obscured by clouds, the solar heat was great, and marching was very fatiguing, especially as the paths were generally obstructed by fallen trees, or disappeared in swamps. So far as I could ascertain, this cloudy, showery weather lasts usually from early in November till the middle of January. From this time until the setting in of the south-west monsoon, late in March, rain falls but seldom, the heat increases, and the difference between daily and nightly temperature becomes much greater. At this time the nights become chilly, dews heavy, and, near rivers and swamps, dense night fogs are common. It is then dangerous to health for troops to bivouac in the open. During the interval, between the ending of the south-west, and setting in of the north-east, monsoon, the climate is hot and comparatively dry. Near the coast, the climate is always more equable than in the interior, and fogs are rare. Here, too, the neighbourhood of swamps appears to be comparatively free from danger at all times. Malacca, surrounded on three sides by marshes and paddy-fields, is a very healthy place; and Mattang, the port of Larut, which is built in a mangrove swamp, is said by the officials resident there not to be unhealthy. Certainly few if any, cases of fever originated there amongst the troops. Climate of the Malay Peninsula. 25. Although the climate of the Malay Peninsula is a comparatively healthy one for the tropics, Europeans who have lived there for some time are generally pallid and anæmic; and medical men of experience in the country consider that immediate change to a cooler climate is necessary when any serious illness occurs. Even amongst the sepoys, those who had suffered from fever or dysentery gained strength very slowly, and were very subject to relapses. The Goorkhas appeared to feel the climate almost as much as their European Officers,
APPENDIX270 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY BENGAL. Supply of medicines, &c.,wasample. The supplies of medicines and hospital requirements were ample, and I was able to supply the wants of the European and auxiliary troops attached to the Malacca column. Some of the packages were rather large and heavy for coolie carriage in a country without roads. Water- tight cases of tin or zinc petarrahs are best adapted for such a climate; nothing else will keep out the drenching rain. The panniers and field companions were very convenient for detach- ments and for use in the field. The condensed milk was most useful, 30. As milk was not procurable, it was at first difficult to provide nourishing food for the sick sepoys, especially for those suffering from dysentery; but they soon took a great fancy to the condensed milk in tins. The supply of this was, of course, limited; but I believe that its use saved several lives. I would suggest that a moderate supply be allowed in expeditions to. countries where, as in the Malay Peninsula and China, fresh milk is not obtainable. Report on medical estab- lishment. 31. Surgeon G. Bomford, who was attached to the force, was everything that I could wish. He was always active, cheerful under hardships, and careful of the sick. All the hospital establishment behaved very well indeed; and, owing to the number of detachments, the subordinates were often placed in responsible positions. Statistics. Of the 10 European Officers attached to the regiment, 2 were invalided (one for dysenteric diarrhoea, and the other for hepatitic congestion), both of whom have returned to duty. A third Officer; who suffered from hepatitis and dysentery, is still in a very bad state of health. The sickness and mortality in the 1st Goorkhas, while absent from India, from 26th November 1875 to 31st March 1876, wasMEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BENGAL FOR THE YEAR 1875.
