SIR, I have the honour to submit the second volume of my report on ' Surra.' This includes an account of Surra in Equines, Bovines, Buffaloes and Canines, together with an account of experiments conducted with a view to reproduce the disease in animals by means of soiled blood containing the trypanosoma obtained from rats (Mus decumanus), bandicoots (Mus nesokia giganleus), and different species of Indian freshwater fish. The majority of the experiments recorded in this work were conducted during 1891EXPLANATION OF TERMS, &c. The first day of the disease is that upon which the Surra hæmatozoon is present in the blood, either when contracted naturally, or as the result of inoculation.

In almost every district a different vernacular name is given to this disease, for instance in Rájpu- tána the disease in camels is known by three distinct names, viz. "Tebersa" meaning "three years duration," "Sukul" and "Galtia" from the fact that one of the symptoms is rapid wasting, "drying up" or "melting away" of the animal's body. The following is a list of the vernacular names of this disease in different parts of the country, as far as at present ascertained.' In addition English equivalents have been added, with a view to convey an idea as to the literal meaning of the native terms. The inhabitants all over India generally name a disease after the most prominent symptom of the malady observed in their locality, but it is by no means easy at times to find the corresponding word in the English language so as to exactly convey the correct meaning expressed by the vernacular term :2 Cachar and Assam. It was also reported from the Persian Gulf, Persia and Tonquin. There were also strong reasons for believing that animals have succumbed to this disease in Abysinnia, the Zambesi, East Africa, Australia, North America, Brazil and Southern Europe. Since the publication of the above report numerous fresh centres have been brought to light. Out of the thirty-one districts in the Punjab, Surra has been found up to the present to be enzootic in twenty-two, the worst being the Karnal District. In the North-Western Provinces the disease has been observed in the Saharanpur, Muzzafarnagar, Meerut, Bulandshahar, Gaziabad and Fyzabad Dis- tricts ; in the north-east portion of the Jalpaiguri District, Bengal. In addition widespread out- breaks have occurred in the Ahmedabad, Baroda and neighbouring localities which have carried off thousands of equines. Spontaneous cases of Surra have also been recognized in Lower Burmah, Rájpu- tána and Bikanir. One horse also arrived in Bombay from the Persian Gulf suffering from Surra. In other parts of the world the trypanosoma has been reported from Algeria (Equines), France (Bovines), Korea (Equines and Bovines), Egypt and Syria (Equines), while in Zululand a trypanosoma has been observed in the blood of equines, bovines and canines, which is indistinguishable microscopi- cally from the flagellated protozoon found in the circulation of animals in India. SECTION III. OUTBREAKS OF SURRA. A.3 of the district, and notably the Tárorú tableland, and the high plain of Palwal and the east of Nuh and Firozpur, used to be very healthy; but fever has come with the Agra Canal into the villages along its course in the high plain. Fever is the chief cause of mortality. Firozpur Tahsil4 67 feet ; down the centre of the district from the town of Rohtak to Gwálesan the depth is 67 feet also; at a distance of 7 to 9 miles from the western border, the water is 80 feet below the surface, and along the western boundary of the Rohtak Tahsil 115 feet."5 " Pheta" (Surra) caused its ravages during the rains of 1895 in 72 villages visited by Veterinary- Captain Pease. The disease occurred in many other villages, especially in those in the Khadar (132 in number) and Naili (64 in number) where it is said to occur annually ; but as so few horses are kept, the donkey and ponies belonging to the Kumhárs (potters) only are attacked, and their loss does not attract much attention. The losses from Surra in sixteen (16) villages in the above tahsil, when statistics were forthcoming, were 48 per cent. horses, 40 per cent mules and 44 per cent. asses. Many of the villages lost, in addition, a great number of their dogs from this disease ; in some there was scarcely one remaining. The canines appear to have contracted the malady through eating diseased carcasses. It was thought to be more than likely that the villages in the Indri and Pipli Tahsils, sustained severe losses from the same causes as the above mentioned6 TABLE I.

The Ambala District comprises two detached blocks of country lying between the Jumna and the Sutlej, and is divided into six tahsils, of which four (Ambala, Naraingarh, Jagadhri, and Pipli) are included in the larger block, covering the southern and eastern portions of the district, the re- maining two (Kharar and Rupar) running up to the Sutlej in the extreme north-west. It includes an area of 2,412 square miles and has a population of 1,033,427 souls. The height above sea-level ranges from 800' to 1,000' and the district is usually described as sub- montane, which is correct as regards the Rupar, Kharar, Naraingarh and Jagadhri tahsils ; but in the southern portion of the district, including the greater part of the Pipli Tahsil, and a large part of Ambala, the hills are low, bleak and generally devoid of vegetation other than rough scrub. The soil is chiefly stiff clay, and the face of the country is broken with huge tracts of dhak jungle, and the depth of water below the surface varies from 9' to 24 feet, in the Khadir 9', Bet Markanda 18', and Bangar 24'. Irrigation is carried out in Pipli from the Western Jumna Canal, wells, and kacha tanks, but as a whole the district is essentially dependent on the rain for its crops, the normal amount for the Pipli Tahsil being 24 inches. The rainfall is, however, very irregular, the crops in the southern dis- trict, especially, being frequently liable to excessive moisture and floods. The Márkanda is the second largest stream in the district, and enters the Pipli Tahsil near Sháha- bad, passing through in a south-westerly direction. In the rainy season it is extremely liable to floods, the water spreading over the face of the country far and wide and depositing silt and sand in all directions. The Jumna on the east and the Sutlej on the north-west also flood a large extent of country near their course, and some damage is done by the water-logging of the soil through the low banks of the Western Jumna Canal. The climate of Ambala is fairly good, but the changes of temperature are severe. During the rains the country becomes saturated, and fever is common everywhere, the mortality from this cause in years of excessive floods being very high indeed. The cold weather comes on suddenly in November or December before the people have recovered their strength after an epidemic of fever, and the result is much further loss of life from pneumonia. The southern half of the Pipli Tahsil is a specially unhealthy tract, as much land there remains under water for a long time in years of excessive rainfall, owing to the formation of the country and the way in which it is traversed by petty channels which cannot carry off the drainage poured into them. Pipli Tahsil.8 Cases may, however, occur higher up, but from my enquiries I should say that they are not very common. There is a very considerable difference in the conditions in the upper part of the district, although it is all more or less subject to inundation and flooding in the rainy season. The soil is, however, lighter and the river beds sandy, whilst also the water runs very fast in them. The worst part of the country here appears to be between the Jumna Canal and the river in the south-east corner, where, owing to the increase in the amount of water passing through the canal, the whole of the villages in the vicinity are badly water-logged and very unhealthy. Almost every village in this line was attacked last year and the losses were very severe. The continuation of this line in Karnal is also very bad indeed, as has been already mentioned. I do not think that this tract is at all likely to improve as the evil seems to be a growing one, and it is not worth while to bother about horses in these villages. It is quite possible that the disease will increase in the Karnal Depôt as it appears to have done in the villages in the neighbourhood; however time will show." Ludhiana District. Ludhiana is the most western of the three districts of the Umballa Division, and has for its northern boundary the river Sutlej for a distance of nearly 60 miles. It comprises an area of 1,375 acres, and has a population of 618,835 souls. The district is divided into three tahsils9 The people try no remedy now. They used to apply a hot iron across the loins, but when the disease is recognised, they know that there is no hope for the animal, and so resort to charms or leave the case to chance ".10 Along these two rivers are strips of rich alluvial land, composed of sand and loam, over which the waters spread when in flood. Between the town of Dasuah and the Biás there extends a long tract of marsh land, known by the name of " Chhamb," and which is the most unhealthy part of the district. The flooding of the Chhamb commences in June or July and the land remains under water until September, after which it gradually dries up. The plain portion of the district is of alluvial formation throughout, and was formed from the deposit of silt carried by the hill torrents or chohs, which pour down into the plain in the rainy season at almost every mile. There are a few small canals in the north of the district, taking their rise in the Biás, some of which are liable to flooding the surrounding country in the rains. The average rainfall of each tahsil is Hoshiarpur 36", Garshankar 32", Dasuah 35", and Una 37". The climate of the district is generally healthy, the soil is sandy, and the water has no tendency to collect or stagnate, except in the Chhamb District in Dasuah, where the health of the population is not so good. The commonest forms of illness are fevers of different kinds, and bowel complaints. Goitre is com- monly met with in the hilly tracts, and in the northern plain of Dasuah, where there is much canal irrigation. Cattle, sheep and goats are kept by the villagers, but few horses, camels, or donkeys. Dasuah Tahsil.11 Ferozepore, and Moga lie above it. Moga lies entirely away from the river ; Zira occupies the angle opposite the Biás confluence, followed by Ferozepur, which extends down to the point where the district is narrowest ; while Mukatsar and Fálzilka have limited river frontages but great depths towards the interior. The surface of the district slopes very gently from the north-east towards the south-west at the rate of about 1½ feet in the mile. It is all of an alluvial formation, and contains no hills, and indeed not a rock or stone. On closer acquaintance it is found to be divided into three broad plateaux raised slightly one above the other, the edges of which, in the form of two broken and shelving banks, run nearly parallel to the course of the river. The highest of these three tracts contains nearly all the Moga Tahsil, a few villages in the south of Zira, the extreme south-east corner of Ferozepur and about half of the Mukatsar and Fazilka tahsils. It might be conveniently distinguished as the Kot- Kapura plateau, the pargana so named (now in Faridkot territory) being near its centre and forming a link between the Moga and Mukatsar portions. Its surface is extremely smooth. The soil is rather sandy loam of reddish-brown colour, broken only by the lines of old water-courses, along which sand- drifts are always to be found. The plain comprising the southern half of the Zira Tahsil (excepting a few villages above mentioned), the eastern half of the Ferozepur Tahsil, and all the north-west of Mukatsar and Fazilka, except a strip along the present course of the river, might be called the Mudki plain, from the name of the well-known town and battle-field, which is situated midway in its length. A leading characteristic of this tract is the brackishness of the wells, which increases towards the south- west until the water is undrinkable. Below the Mudki plain is the river side tract, sometimes called the Bet. Between Zira and the confluence of the Sutlej and Biás the Bet has a width of 12 miles, elsewhere it is not generally more than about 6 miles wide. Its soil is a dark-grey clay intermixed with strata of sand. The rainfall is very uncertain, the rainy season sometimes beginning in the end of June and some- times being delayed until the end of July, and the period of its termination is equally uncertain. Feroze- pur is proverbial for dust-storms. The average rainfall at Tahsil stations from 1873-74 to 1888-89, was : Ferozepur 22.3, Zira 25.1, Moga 20.9, Mukatsar 13.7, Fazilka 12.3 inches. No systematic thermometrical record has ever been maintained in the district. Private observa- tions, however, show that in December and January the temperature ranges in houses between 40° and 70°, whilst during June and July (with closed doors) its range in houses not artificially cooled is from 92° to 97°. There are two distinct varieties of horses bred in the district12 Amritsar District. This district comprises 1,558 square miles and is a section of the tract known as the Bári Doáb, or country lying between the Ravi and Biás rivers. It is bounded on the north-west by the Ravi, and on the south-east by the Biás. It is divided into three tahsils, Amritsar, Tarn Taran, and Ajnala, the last named occupying all that portion which fronts the Ravi, and the two former abutting on the Biás. The district is small, compact, and thickly populated, the total population in 1891 being 992,697. It has the appearance of a continuous level plain, unbroken by hill or valley, and sparsely wooded, except near villages and irrigation wells and canals. The formation is distinctly alluvial, and the prevailing soil is a light reddish yellow loam (Maira), which stiffens into rohi or clay, where the surface drainage collects on its way down the Doáb from the hills. In Amritsar, the usual depth of the water from the surface is 30 to 40 feet, except in the high- lands on the banks of the Biás, where it is from 40 to even 60 feet. In Taran Tarn the depth is ordinarily from 40 to 60 feet, except in the " Bet ", where it comes to within 12 or 13 feet of the surface. In the Ajnala Tahsil the ordinary depth is from 20 to 30 feet, but under 20 feet in the ' Sailab' and Sakki lands. The Biás river takes its rise in the Kulu valley, and passsing through the Kangra District enters the sandy valley, which divides the Amritsar District from Kapurthala. On the right the Biás valley is bounded by an abrupt cliff of from 24 to 30 feet. At the foot of this, between it and the cold wea- ther bed of the river, lies a strip of alluvial land "Bet", which, at some points, is as much as two miles broad. The left bank, on the other hand, is uniformly low, and on the Kapurthala side there is a stretch of moist alluvial land running back for several miles into the interior, which is fertile, well wooded, and liable to inundation. The river itself carries an immense body of water in the rainy season, and in flood time is often a mile in width. The Ravi is a river of different character. Both banks are, for the most part, of equal height, and the river in flood time encroaches impartially on either side. The Sakki Nála is the only other perennial stream found in the district, and this winds in a deep tortuous bed between abrupt banks, and damage from floods is slight. There are other minor drainage lines forming quite a net-work in the southern part of Ajnala, and these often take the shape of a chain of swamps or chhambs, the principal of which are found at Bhalapind, Bagga, and Jastarwal. The rainfall is fairly certain, an annual fall of about 20 inches may be expected in that half of the district which is nearest Lahore, and one of about 25 inches in the northern half nearest the hills. The Amritsar District is not a very healthy one, owing to the net-work of canals and distributaries made in the Tarn Taran Tahsil. Fever is often terribly prevalent throughout the district in the autumn months, when a hot sun in the day succeeds cold and heavy dews at night. The enfeebled and poorly clad victims of malarial fever succumb easily to pneumonia and dysentery in winter. Cattle are largely kept, and buffaloes are almost a speciality in the district. Horses and ponies too are numerous. Sheep and goats are kept by village menials, chiefly Barais, and mules and donkeys are largely used in the carrying trade as pack animals. Camels are few, as there is little suitable grazing ground for them, and these are solely used as beasts of burden. Ajnala Tahsil.13 the disease is caused by the animals eating a species of grass called Naree, which grows abundantly in low-lying and water-logged land. They state, with probably little truth, that this grass has only re- cently appeared in the neighbourhood. In all likelihood the knowledge of the disease has only recently been acquired, and this grass is supposed to be the cause of it." " It also appeared among the solipeds at Chakmakund, and out of 12 horses, 2 mules and 25 donkeys, 7 horses, 2 mules and 11 donkeys succumbed to the disease." " The villages Jagatpur, Serai Amantkhan and Kotesayan also suffered from the disease in 1895." Lahore District. The total area of the district is 3,602 square miles and has a population of 1,075,379 souls. Of this area about one-fourth lies on the right bank of the Ravi, forming part of what is known as the Rechna Doáb between the Ravi and Chenáb rivers ; the remainder is on the left bank or near side of the Ravi between it and the Sutlej. The Rechna Doáb or Trans-Ravi tract is mostly lowland that has in times past been under the influence of river water. There are four tahsils in this district, viz. Lahore, Kasur, Chunian and Sharakpur. The surface of the district is in the main level throughout. The valleys of the three rivers Biás Ravi and Degh and the ridges between them constitute the principal physical features of the district. The broad and high upland between the Sutlej and Ravi is fairly cultivated towards the north, but contracting towards the south, and as it contracts, assuming the appearance of a barren steppe covered with low bushes giving forage to camels and in favourable seasons, with long grass used as pasturage for cattle. This tract is the celebrated Munjha. The lowlands which lie to the south of Munjha are known as the Hithár, derived from the verna- cular term het (below). The high bank which runs nearly due east and west from the Sutlej, forms the southern boundary of the Munjha. The district is wanting in fertility, except on the banks of rivers and in the canal tracts, but it appears that water is of the greatest necessity. The average rainfall from 1868 to 1892 was as follows in each tahsil :14 Kasur Tahsil.15 montane region merges into a waterless, almost rain-less, and therefore sterile plain, unculturable save by irrigation. The southern half of the district and a small portion of the west-central portion are supplied with water for irrigation purposes by a canal, which branches from the river Chenáb at Khanki in the Wazirabad Tahsil, but wells are the mainstay of the agriculture of the district. The average rainfall from 1873 to 1892 was about 22 inches. The district enjoys a healthy reputation, notwithstanding the fact that the variation of temperature is very great, viz. from a maximum shade temperature of 108° F. in the hot to 29° F. in the cold season. Very large numbers of bovines and equines as well as sheep and goats are to be found in this dis- trict. Camels are also fairly numerous. Wazirabad Tahsil.16 Sialkot, Zafarwal and Pasror Tahsils.17 being conveyed over the adjoining districts by numerous canals and cuts. Below Nowshera the land on either side is, for many months, completely saturated with moisture, the stream in ordinary flood sea- sons flowing on a level with its banks. Water is therefore everywhere close to the surface, and in parts considerable tracts of bog or marsh are formed, which do not completely dry up at any season of the year. There are no lakes in the district, but owing to extensive percolation from the rivers, large marshes are fórmed in many low-lying tracts in the neighbourhood of the Swát and Kábul and a large one exists near Peshawar. The rainfall varies in the different tahsils, being on an average of four years :18 The average rainfall in the different tahsils is :19 northern portion of the Chenáb low-lands and central plateau ; that of Mailsi the eastern riverain of the Sutlej and the south-eastern part of the plateau ; and that of Lodhran the western riverain of the Sutlej and the angle at the junction of that river with the Chenáb ; while the Multan and Shujabad tahsils, of which the former lies to the north and the latter to the south, include the median low-lands of the Chenáb, the Multan Tahsil also stretching away from the river into the centre of the district. The whole of this tract is an alluvial plain sloping gently from the north-east to the south-west. It is all of comparatively and much of it of very recent formation. The general aspect of the district is as follows. Starting from the present banks of the rivers Chenáb and Sutlej, we find first of all a strip of land subject to Sailáb or the annual overflow of the rivers during the rains. This strip extends in- land about three miles on the Sutlej, and rather further on the Chenáb and Ravi. These lands form the low chaks or assessment circles of the regular and present settlements; they are traversed by the canals, but do not generally receive much canal water. Beyond these comes a belt of higher land where wells can be made without difficulty, the water being from 20 to 30 feet below the surface, and on which canal irrigation is generally plentiful. The depth of this belt depends chiefly on the canals. Where there are none, as in most parts of Sarai Sidhu, it is not more than four or five miles; along the Chenáb, where canals run almost parallel with the river, it is six or seven miles ; and along the Sutlej, where they strike more inland, it is more than ten miles. Multan is celebrated for its heat, but it is doubtful whether it is really much hotter than most other districts in the plains. The hottest month is June, in which the mean temperature of the air in the shade stands at 95.73° F. and January is the coolest, in which it is registered 54.70° F. The average rainfall from 1873-74 to 1877-78 of each tahsil in tenths of an inch was: Multan 65, Shujabad 41, Lodhran 61, Mailsi 19, Sarai Sidhu 41. The district is certainly a healthy one. The prevailing sickness is fever, which is very general from August to the end of October. It is very difficult to shake off entirely, but is not often fatal. Lodhran Tahsil.20 The surface of the country has a general slope from north to south, and in the north-east of the district this is combined with a slope towards the south-east. Irrigation is carried on extensively from wells, tanks and canals, two-ninths of the total cultivated area of the district being so watered. Owing to excessive percolation from the canals numerous jhils or swamps were formed, but these by suitable drainage have now been reclaimed. The rains usually set in towards the close of June, and last until the middle of September, or sometimes a month later. Irregularities in their occurrence are surely followed or accompanied by disease, generally in the form of fever. The average total rainfall, according to seasons, for the whole district, varies from 18.9 to 56.6 inches, with a mean for 11 years of 35.7 inches. The minimum temperature observed by Dr. Royle was 37° in January, the maximum 105° or 107°. The temperature rises rapidly from the beginning of March, and by the middle of June the maximum is attained. There is no local breed of cattle in the district. The breed of horses in the southern part of the district called the Katha is considered very good, and it was partly on that account that a stud depôt was established at Saharanpur in the year 1842. Nakur Tahsil.21 and that at the time of death one pound of blood frequently contains a minimum of 2,358,629,000 hæmatozoa, and the natural habitat of this protozoon is water), here then is a ready source by which the disease may have been transmitted ; and the astonishing point is that more animals did not succumb at this chowki. It will be seen on reference to Appendix No. III that the average total rainfall in the Mohand Pass during 1893 was 95.88 inches, and from the commencement of the month of May until the first death took place on July 30th, 46.39 inches. This latter average in 1893 is in excess to the extent of 28.27 inches over the average for 1890, 1891, and 1892. 5. History of outbreak of 1894.22 period different forms of disease have prevailed, in many instances little has been done to eradicate their spores. When death overtakes these animals either in the stables or working on the road, the same thing practically happens. The carcass is simply dragged a few yards from the line of route or perhaps into the immediate jungle, and there becomes a prey of wild beasts and birds. The ground, which has been soiled with the blood and some fluids of the body, probably becomes the seat of the resting form or spores of the disease, which during the next rains again light up and become, if oppor- tunity offers, the means by which other animals eating the grass therefrom receive the contagium into their system. Wild animals, viz., hyenas, jackals, &c., may also be the means of disseminating the virus. On 24th September 1894, I saw a horse lying dead within 5 yards of the road between Mohand and Ganeshpur. In 1893, Smith and Rodwell's Manager shot two hyenas and several jackals which were feeding on the carcass of a horse just dead of Surra. 11. Mode of communication of disease.23 TABLE III.

It is bounded on the north by the Muzaffarnagar District, on the east by the Ganges, on the west by the Jumna and on the south by the Bulandshahr District. It comprises an area of about 2,353 square miles, with a population of 1,273,914 souls, or 541 to the square mile. It is divided into 6 tahsils, viz., Meerut, Hapur, Ghaziabad, Bagpat, Sardhana, and Mawana. The whole district presents a level alluvial plain, without any hills or even eminences of any magnitude, the elevation ranging from 690 feet in the south to 770 feet in the north. The average rainfall for 9 years was 27.53 inches, but it varies in different years from 17 to 37 inches. There are no usar plains in the district, and the comparative absence of the saline efflorescence ' reh ' is very marked. The Ganges Khádir is very wide and some eight to ten thousand cattle are occasionally grazed on it during the year, but not in the rainy season. The principal rivers of the district are the Ganges, Jumna and Hindan, and there are three main lines of canals, the eastern Jumna, the main branch of the Ganges, and Anúpshahr branch of the Ganges canal. The district is not subjected to floods to any great extent and is one of the healthiest in India. The average rainfall varies from 17.3 to 37.96 inches, with a mean of 26.5 inches, for the years 1844-45 to 1871-72. Cattle, buffaloes, sheep, goats, horses and donkeys are the domestic animals kept in this district. The breed of horses has wonderfully improved during the last fifteen years. Several zamindárs have fine horses by Arab stallions out of Katha mares and by the stallions of the Government Hápur Stud out of country-bred mares. Gaziabad Tahsil.25 The stud extends its operation to this district, but horse-breeding is not so popular here as in Saharanpur, though some fair animals may be found in the Rájput chaubisi in the north-west of the district on the Saharanpur border. Shamli Tahsil.26 inundates the country up to the cavalry lines in the rains. The disease is said to have first appeared in a squadron of horses which were out on duty during the rainy season in the Azamgarh District at Jhajman. The large marshes and lakes that dot the surface of the land are the most prominent objects in the landscape of the Azamgarh District. Many of the horses died, and the disease also appeared in those of the remainder of the regiment. One hundred and fifty (150) horses succumbed to the disease. Surra is said to have also caused considerable loss in 1894. The probable reason the horses which had been out on duty in 1893 were first attacked is, that they were weakened by exposure to the climate in the rains, and so fell victims to the disease earlier than the others. KUMAON DIVISION. R. and K. Railway Tonga Service. Kathgodam.27 up the ghat. The grass, instead of being obtained from the plains, has for years been collected during the cold season of the year (November to January) from the high-lands at an altitude of 4,500 to 5,500 feet; all corn and grain has been carefully cleaned and screened at Kathgodam (in order to avoid the presence of rat excrement *) before being conveyed to the stages, and the creeper (Bel) has not been utilized during the past two rainy seasons as fodder, as is the case on the Simla Dâk service. It has been before mentioned that ' Surra' on this Dâk line usually appears first amongst the animals standing at Bhugiaghat, some four miles from Kathgodam, on the Naini Tal Road ; the stables being surrounded on three sides by fairly thick jungle, which, during the wet season, is filled with dense vegetation. Annually, soon after the setting in of the monsoon, the exact date varying in different years, fever makes its appearance in the animals at this stable, and later at Kathgodam; most of these cases of fever turning out to be 'Surra'. In 1896 all the animals, some twelve in number, succumbed to this disase at Bhugiaghat, and subsequently these buildings were closed for the season. In previous years the worst cases of fever only have been removed to the upper hills, but during the past one, for the first time, a stringent system has been introduced. On an animal being observed to be the subject of fever, its removal to a stable at an elevation of 4,500 to 5,500 feet has forthwith taken place, far away from the chaukis containing any of the other Tonga horses. Three animals have only been transferred during 1897, two of which, later, were found to be suffering from Surra, but no animals at any of the other stages have shown signs of sickness, although in 1896, 92 per cent. of the equines succumbed to this disease. The small number of animals attacked this year may, on the other hand, prove to be a mere coincidence; this year being what we term a non-Surra year. But in previous reports we have pointed out that, according to statistics furnished 28 Commissariat mules working between Bareilly and Ranikhet. On the 6th October 1894, ninety-six Government transport mules left Bareilly for Kathgodam, consisting of forty-eight pack and forty-eight draft animals. The distance between Bareilly and Kathgodam is sixty-six miles, and was completed in six marches. The animals, before leaving for the journey, presented a healthy appearance. At the second halting place, Danranian, two marches from Bareilly, one mule died ; at the third stage, four; at the fifth, one; and one at the sixth. On the arrival of the animals at Kathgodam, Veterinary-Captain E. Taylor was ordered from Lucknow to report upon the outbreak. He found the disease to be Surra, and shot four animals, and eleven died. Twenty animals were despatched to Naini Tal, and these returned to Bareilly without showing any signs of disease. Of the remainder, eleven were sent back to head-quarters, and the rest were taken to Ranikhet, viâ Bhowali, where one succumbed, and eleven were destroyed between the17th and 23rd October, and one animal succumbed at Bumsaon on the return journey to Kathgodam. During the monsoon of 1894 very heavy rain fell, in all some 163 inches at Naini Tal and a trifle less at Kathgodam. The death-rate amongst the horses of the Tonga service was sixty-three out of a total of 128 or 49.22 per cent. It is needless to mention that the animals which left Bareilly on the 6th October apparently in good health, had Surra amongst them previous to starting on the march, for, one died at the second halting place and four at the third. It is a well known experimental fact that if a large quantity of soiled blood containing 300,000 Surra organisms in each one c.cm. be subcutaneously injected into a healthy horse, the parasite will not be detected in the circulation of the inoculated animal until the 4th to the 6th day, and, with the exception of the usual symptoms of fever, no other signs of Surra will be detected for some days, unless a few petechiæ invade the conjunctival membranes. When the Surra hæmatozoon was given in water to a healthy horse, the time occupied between the last administration and the appearance of the organism in the blood was seventy-five days (vide Surra Report, Vol. I, Horse No. XX). Therefore the animals which left Bareilly in apparently good health must have contracted Surra at least several weeks before starting on their march to Kathgodam. BOMBAY PRESIDENCY. AHMEDABAD and BARODA, &c., DISTRICTS. In 1893, a large number of horses and donkeys died all over these districts. The city of Ahmedabad appears to have been spared this visitation, and also Dhandhuka, but it swept over all the rest of the district and the Gáikwári country to the north. A Resolution of Government postponed the Horse Show at Ahmedabad for two years. It is not known whether Surra occurred in 1892, but probably it did. There is no doubt, however, that the excessive rainfall of 1893, the bulk of which fell during the month of July, in each year, was answerable for the disease appearing at the end of September, as the hæmatozoon thrives in a wet, warm and muggy climate. On reference to Vol. I it will be seen that Horse No. XX contracted the disease seventy-five days after imbibing the Surra hæmatozoon in water. TABLE V.

Mean for five years, 188929 village in the affected district largely contributing to the mortality. The outbreak made its appearance about the beginning of October, and in six to eight weeks the affected animals were reduced to skeletons, and were in the last stages of the disease. From Patan in Northern Gùjarát all the villages or the route to Kharaghoda were visited, and in nearly all the disease had destroyed a large number of the horses, donkeys and camels. In the Varavali Táluka of the Gaikwar Territory, which comprises about one hundred and fifty (150) villages, some fifty (50) were more or less affected centres, losing the majority of their animals from Surra. As a rule, wherever donkeys died in their wanderings the carcasses were allowed to remain and decompose, and to be the possible means of contamination of other places. In the Viramgám District the disease was reported at Sinaj, Anandpur, Chanear and in the Cheemul Táluka. As affecting the movement of the Battery from Ahmedabad, outbreaks were reported at Sánand, Goria, Patri and Kharaghoda. Further, disease was known to exist south of Viramgám, between Dholka and Dhandhuka Táluka. Throughout the whole district under observation the rainfall for the year was very excessive, and a good deal of the country of Viramgám and Kharaghoda had been under water, conditions especially favourable for the development of this disease. The rainfall for the year is shown in the following statement, the outbreak being favoured pro- bably by the very heavy rainfall in the month of July :30 TABLE. VII.

37 SOME NOTES ON SURRA IN BURMAH.* Outbreak amongst Military Police Ponies at Mandalay, July 1896. A number of ponies, Mounted Infantry and Transport, of the Yamethin Battery, arrived at Mandalay from Yamethin on the 26th April 1896. On the 1st of June a pony was found to be suffering from fever, and also showing suspicious symptoms of Surra ; he was promptly segregated, and treated with Arsenic. This animal died on the 23rd June. No microscopic examination of the blood was made. This pony had been to Zagobin and May-myo; he is supposed to have contracted the disease on the road. Case 2.38 came on two of the cases referred to, and in which, no less than three quarters of the cuticular surface was involved. The animals from which these stomachs were taken were destroyed, as they were suffering from Surra; neither were in bad condition, and were taking food up to the very last moment. Though the cuticular coat is invariably involved, the lesions undoubtedly do in some cases extend to the villous portion. The anatomical differences, however, naturally, to some extent, alter the appearances of the ulcers, which are often seen with a smoother flat surface, and surrounded by a ring of swollen mucous membrane. I am of opinion that in all cases of death from Chronic Surra, or in animals that have been destroy- ed after the disease has been in existence for some time, that ulceration of the stomach, more or less extensive, will be seen post-mortem. The deep yellow pigmentation is not constant, but in nearly all cases there is a distinct yellowish tinge about the cuticular coat. The villous portion often is in parts, owing to degenerative changes, denuded of its epithelial lining. In some cases a large portion of the cuticular coat may be pigmented. The colour is a bright yellow, which shows up beautifully alongside of the whiteness of the normal epithelium. Parasites (Spiroptera microstoma) are constantly found, especially in the stomachs of mules, embedded in the gelatinous mucus on the villous coat, but, as you are well aware, have nothing to do with the disease. Bots are frequently met with, and this year 1 met with a case where the bots had attached themselves to the mucous membrane of the duodenum ; there were quite one hundred. Spiroptera nests are sometimes seen in the stomach. I think more frequently in mules, but they are rare. Last month I was present at forty-one post-mortems, but did not observe a single nest. I have heard it stated that feeding on unbruised paddy might cause gastric ulceration ; if this was the case I am certain that I would have noticed it in post-mortems on animals that had not succumbed to Surra. In Lower Burmah the people rarely give their animals anything else (Rangoon not included). I always feed my Burman ponies on paddy and never think of crushing it. I have never observed ulceration of the small intestines, but have noticed circumscribed local con- gestions. In a few cases extensive mucous congestion was noted. The intestines often contain a quantity of a very yellow fluid. Nothing remarkable to note about condition of the large intestines. In advanced cases the spleen is generally enlarged ; there is, as a rule, an excess of pulp, so that it pits on pressure. The structure is at times disorganised. The liver is usually very healthy ; cases of congestion, softening, may be met with ; miliary cal- careous deposits are often seen. In some cases the organ is much enlarged. I have noticed flukes in the livers of some cases. Kidneys.39 Prevention of Surra. From what I know of this malady I am convinced that it is impossible to prevent its occurrence in tracts where the disease is endemic. As Government transport have to pass through such tracts every season carrying rations to stations in the Chin Hills, Bernardmyo and Kengtung, I am of opinion that much can be done towards reducing the terrible annual mortality. To begin with, now that there are permanent camping grounds on the roads to the Chin Hills and Bernardmyo, and the date on which the rationing will commence is known for some time previous, I see no reason why a certain number of muleteers under good non-commissioned officers should not be sent off a month before the animals are expected to arrive to each of the suspicious camping grounds. During this period grass could be collected, dried, stacked in sheds at a trifling cost. Ten men working at each camp ought to collect 15,000 to 18,000 lbs. of grass in a month. In places where paddy straw is pro- curable it might also be stacked and used as chaff. I would recommend that these grass-cutting parties be permanently employed during the working season. Good fodder can be procured during the months of October, November, December, and part of January. If this suggestion is carried out sufficient fodder could be collected to carry the animals through the remaining months of the open season. All men selected or volunteering for this employment should be subjected to strict medical examination, ánd only those who are strong and who have not been subjected to fever be allowed to proceed. In order to prevent mules grazing while on the march, I would suggest that a muzzle be provided for each animal ; they should be put on before the mules leave their standings, and on no account removed till they are tied up at their pickets at the next camp. As matters now stand, it is impossible to condemn a day's grass supply, no matter how bad it may be, as the animals would have to go without. Water-supply.40 as there are defects in the feeding, watering and general care of transport, so long will the animals suffer severely from enzootic diseases. While at head-quarters the greatest care is taken to see that the animals get good dry grass, excellent water, that they are properly and regularly groomed, and that the stables, standings and vicinity are kept in a sanitary condition, yet when these same animals are called ùpon to perform severe work, and require, if possible, even more care than when in cantonments, they are handed over practically to the tender mercies of transport jemadars and muleteers. These men are very willing, and, when looked after, excellent men for the work which should be required of them. Two points which I wish to bring particularly to your notice are :- (a) the urgent necessity of providing ample European supervision with Government transport ; and (b) the desirability of getting the rationing over as early as possible, even if extra animals have to be employed. Hired Transport.41 favourably with the special " fly tracts " of any other country. In Burma they are particularly bad after the first few thunder-storms, i.e. the end of April and early part of May. Indeed they are so troublesome that Burmans when obliged to take carts, &c., through them, take the precaution of making torches of strips of bark of one of the wood-oil trees, I think the Dipterocarpus L42 TABLE XIII.

Lieutenant Berkley took up with him to Manipur a ' Turkoman' gelding, 4 years of age. From the time of its purchase in Calcutta at the beginning of June 1890, during its seven month's residence in Manipur and eighteen months in Shillong (Assam) the animal was perfectly fit. Its rations consisted of paddy and Muthi-Kalai, 3 pounds, Kala-Nammik (sulphur and salt ½ ounce of each) mixed with the corn. This animal stabled by itself and was never allowed to go near to the transport lines. The syces in attendance on the transport animals during the time they resided at Mnipur suffered more or less continuously from intermittent fever and occasionally dysentery. Naga Hills. Kay-Lees, in December 1881, was ordered to proceed to the Naga Hills, to investigate a disease which had broken out amongst the transport animals. The Naga Bills are situated to the north-east of Assam, and Kohima forms the furthermost post on the north-east frontier of India. Nichuguard, the head transport office on the line of communication, lay some seven days' march through dense jungle. The author states " the jungle was so dense and enclosed at some parts that, combined with the gases given off from decaying vegetable matter, it interfered with free respiration." " The rains commenced about the 15th March and continued until the middle of June, during which time extensive inundations took place, converting large tracts into swamps. The climate was hot and moist, and at least 25 per cent. of the establishment were down with fever, dysentery " &c. " The disease appears to have been most fatal amongst the mules and ponies between March and June.45 Kay Lees evidently did not examine the blood of these animals, for he states, after giving the fullest details with regard to the symptoms of Surra : " I was unable to trace any history of Anthrax, Surra or Bursati, &c., which could account for this mortality." The suggestions which this officer made with a view to stopping the disease were acted upon, and two years later had the effect of " almost entirely eradicating the pest." The chief suggestions were as follows :46 Autopsy.47 fine oxen by its bite. We watched the animals carefully, and believe that not a score of flies were ever upon them. " A most remarkable feature in the bite of the Tse-tse is its perfect harmlessness in man and wild animals, and even calves so long as they continue to suck the cows. We never experienced the slightest injury from them ourselves, personally, although we lived two months in their habitat, which was in this case as sharply defined as in many others, for the south bank of the Chobe was infested by them, and the northern bank, where our cattle were placed, only fifty yards distant, contained not a single specimen. This was the more remarkable, as we often saw natives carrying over raw meat to the opposite bank with many Tse-tse settled upon it. "The poison does not seem to be injected by a sting, or by ova placed beneath the skin, for, when one is allowed to feed freely on the hand, it is seen to insert the middle prong of three portions, into which the proboscis divides, somewhat deeply into the true skin ; it then draws it out a little way, and it assumes a crimson colour as the mandibles come into brisk operation. The previously shrunken belly swells out, and, if loft undisturbed, the fly quietly departs when it is full. A light itching irritation follows, but not more than in the bite of a mosquito. In the ox this same bite produces no more immediate effects than in man. It does not startle him as the gad-fly does; but a few days afterwards the following symptoms supervene : the eye and nose begin to run, the coat stares as if the animal were cold, a swelling appears under the jaw, and sometimes at the navel ; and, though the animal continues to graze, emaciation commences, accompanied with a peculiar flaccidity of the muscles, and this proceeds unchecked until, perhaps months afterwards, purging comes on, and the animal, no longer able to graze, perishes in a state of extreme exhaustion. Those which are in good condition often perish soon after the bite is inflicted with staggering and blindness, as if the brain were affected by it. Sudden changes of temperature produced by falls of rain seem to hasten the progress of the complaint ; but in general the emaciation goes on uninterruptedly for months, and, do what we will, the poor ani- mals perish miserably. " When opened, the cellular tissue on the surface of the body beneath the skin is seen to be injected with air, as if a quantity of soap-bubbles were scattered over it, or a dishonest awkward butcher had been trying to make it look fat. The fat is of a greenish-yellow colour and of an oily consistence. All the muscles are flabby, and the heart often so soft that the fingers may be made to meet through it. The lungs and liver partake of disease. The stomach and bowels are pale and empty, and the gall-bladder is distended with bile. "These symptoms seem to indicate, what is probably the case, a poison in the blood ; the germ of which enters when the proboscis is inserted to draw blood. The poison-germ, contained in a bulb at the root of the proboscis, seems capable, although very minute in quantity, of reproducing itself, for the blood after death by Tse-tse is very small in quantity, and scarcely stains the hands in dissection. I shall have by and by to mention another insect, which by the same operation produces in the human subject both vomiting and purging. " The mule, ass and goat enjoy the same immunity from the Tse-tse as man and the game. Many large tribes on the Zambesi can keep no domestic animals except the goat, in consequence of the scourge existing in their country. Our children were frequently bitten, yet suffered no harm; and we saw around us numbers of zebras, buffaloes, pigs, pallahs and other antelopes feeding quietly in the very habitat of the Tse-tse, yet as undisturbed by its bite as oxen are when they first receive the fatal poison. There is not so much difference in the natures of the horse and zebra, the buffaloe and ox, the sheep and antelope, as to afford any satisfactory explanation of the phenomenon. Is a man not as much a domestic animal as a dog ? The curious feature in the case, that dogs perish though fed on milk, whereas the calves escape so long as they continue sucking, made us imagine that the mischief might be produced by some plant in the locality, and not by Tse-tse ; but Major Vardon, of the Madras Army, settled that point by riding a horse up to a small hill infested by the insect without allowing him time to graze, and, though he only remained long enough to take a view of the country and catch some specimens of Tse-tse on the animal, in ten days afterwards the horse was dead. " The well-known disgust which the Tse-tse shows to animal excreta. as exhibited when a village is placed in its habitat, has been observed and turned to account by some of the doctors. They mix droppings of animals, human milk, and some medicines together, and smear the animals that are about to pass through a Tse-tse district, but this, though it proves a preventive at the time, is not permanent. There is no cure yet known for the disease. A careless herdsman, allowing a large number of cattle to wander into a Tse-tse district, loses all except the calves ; and Sebituane once lost nearly the entire cattle of his tribe48 Zululand.

State on admis- sion.56 again the Surra organism made its appearance in the blood, and remained with one exception, 9th, from the 5th to the 10th of April. At this period of the case (April 8th) the animal assumed the recumbent position, and when placed in slings fell forward, so after several unsuccessful attempts to get it to stand, further trials were abandoned. It was recognised that if the animal was left in this condition, death would ensue after 24 or 36 hours of severe struggling, consequently a novel treatment was resorted to, viz., the subcutaneous injection of glycerine extracts of the spleen and testicles of the sheep, 2. c.c. of each. On the morning of 9th, the animal assumed the erect position without assistance. Further injections were made of spleen 2.5 c.c. alone on the 10th, spleen and testicle combined, 2.5 c.c. of each on the 12th and 14th April. Death took place on the 24th April, the 148th day of the disease, but during the interval of 16 days until the evening of the 23rd April the animal was able to lie down and get up, without any assistance. In all 814 grains of Arsenic were administered during the 136 days the animal was under treatment. The temperature varied between a maximum of 40.2°C. (104.3 °F.) and a minimum of 37.1°C. (98.8°F.). Autopsy.-Body somewhat emaciated, slight swelling and 57 declined from 40.5°C. to 37.4°C., the evening reading then gradually rose until 38.9°C. was registered on the 19th January, again the temperature gradually rose from 37.8°C. on the evening of 2nd February to 39.2°C. on the day previous to death.

In this case the latent period of the disease was not lengthened, but the organisms only attained to very numerous between 20 and 50 in a field of the microscope on four occasions during a period of 51 days the case lasted. Great difficulty was experienced in getting the animal to take the drug, so that although gastric symptoms appeared, the full physiological effect of the Arsenic was never produced. Preliminary Treatment by Arsenic. CII.60 its blood, and remained present until death on the morning of the 1st August. It was the intention to have continued the drugs for some time longer previous to the subsequent injection of soiled blood being made, but as accidental inoculation took place by a fly or flies it is supposed from a Surra horse standing some yards away, the experiment came to an end prematurely, showing that a mean of 35.8 c.c. of the Double Iodides, persisted in for thirty days, has no destructive effect upon the Trypano- soma. Autopsy.61 they are helped up, but go on eating all the grass they get and much of the corn until they die." Again Steele remarks : "The appetite is excessive throughout the attack; it is remarkable how the animal in a state of semi-coma will continue to eat grass almost without ceasing......Some patients stand and feed to the very last, and then drop dead." Exceptions to this rule, however, must occur, for in September 1896, the water-famine year, I was asked to investigate a new disease which was carrying off a number of horses belonging to the Rohil- khund and Kamaon Railway Company, the most marked symptoms of which were loss of appetite, fever, emaciation, &c. On remarking that it must be the old disease the animals were succumbing to, for it was then September, the height of the Surra season in that part of India, I was definitely informed by the Superintendent, a man with 40 years' experience of horses in this country, that the malady from which the animals suffered was a totally new disease. The reason assigned being that the first symptom noted was loss of appetite followed by fever; " every one knew that a Surra horse never left off feeding, but that his appetite increased rather than diminished as the disease progressed." Within a period of 24 hours after my arrival, the blood of all the horses on the Dák line had been examined microscopically, and 33 found to contain the Surra hæmatozoon in varying numbers. Out of a total of 101 horses, 92 succumbed to Surra. From the instance above cited it will be seen that occasionally Anorexia may be a marked symptom of this disease instead of the ravenous appetite frequently observed. SECTION VI.

This gives one an idea of the deterrent effect produced on the immature form of the Surra hæmatozoon, and its great tenacity of life, for in or dinary cases of Surra the intermissions between the paroxysms, rarely if ever, exceed a maximum duration of seven days. No. CXV, a Persian Gulf entire horse, aged 4 years, belonging to the Bombay Mounted Police It was seized with fever (temperature 105°F.) in the middle of October 1894. This animal was pur- chased on the 16th July 1894, and Surra was diagnosed on the 23rd November 1894; there is, there- fore, no doubt that the disease was contracted in Bombay. The horse was sent to the Poona Labora. tory on November 29th, and the same evening the Arsenical Treatment was commenced, i.e., the 2lst day of the disease, just at the termination of an intermission, probably the second. The hæmatozoon was present in the blood whilst under observation from the 22nd to the 25th day of the disease, but after the latter day did not recur; but two days later an urticarial eruption, involving the under- surface of the abdomen and thighs, appeared and persisted for 24 hours. In all 455 grains of Arsenic were administered in sixty-three days, after which Sodium Iodide in two-drachm doses was continued twice daily for seventy-two hours. The animal made an uninterrupted recovery, and was returned from Poona to the Mounted Police, Bombay, on 9th March 1895, cured. Two days later a Board there examined and reported 'that the animal was sound and healthy, and certified it fit for duty' A letter received from the Commissioner of Police, Bombay, 3rd January 1898, states ' that the horse is still alive, and in good health and condition,' three years and two months after the attack of Surra.

An Australian Gelding, the subject of Surra in December 1893, was cured of this disease by the administration of Arsenic and Iodide of Arsenic and Mercury. Between March and October 1894 the animal gained 235.75 lbs. in weight, and was in a perfect state of health and condition. Fifteen months after the date of the previous attack, and twelve months after the cure was effected, the animal was inoculated with a minute drop of Surra blood, a mere trace of soiled blood being smeared over a scratch on the muzzle, in order to ascertain whether any im- munity had been conferred by the previous attack. The latent period of the second attack occupied seven days. The progress of the disease was marked, as usual, by paroxysms of fever and intermissions lasting 52 days. There were three paroxysms occupying 5, 20 and 22 days, and two intermissions last- ing 3 and 2 days respectively. From this it will be observed that the lengths of the 2nd and 3rd paroxysms were considerably modified, while the presence of the hæmatozoon in the periods was most erratic; one day, on examination of the blood, one in a field of the microscope would be found, whereas on the next day probably only one in a cover-glass preparation. Death took place on the 53rd day of the disease, clearly proving that one attack of Surra is unable to protect against a second attack. Notes for guidance in the treatment of Surra in Equines. Only animals in good or in fairly good condition are suitable to undergo treatment for Surra. It will be found impracticable to attempt to cure ill-preserved animals, such as Tonga-ponies, towards the end of a heavy and hard-worked season. 2. It is of the utmost importance for the successful treatment of Surra that the disease be re- cognized, and the animal subjected to the drug with the least possible delay. 3. The weight of the animal should be ascertained frequently when practicable, so that the maximum dose of Arsenic to be administered during the treatment may be regulated. 4. Arsenic should be given in the form of Liquor Arsenicalis (Fowler's solution). Arsenious Acid (in powder) ... ... ... ... ... 87 grains.

When once the organism of Surra has vanished for some days from the circulation of the animal under treatment, gentle exercise commencing with five hundred (500) yards, and gradually increasing to one mile, morning and evening, may be allowed. But if the temperature becomes ele- vated, all exercise must be stopped, until the former again registers within normal limits. 11. The exudation of semi-solid material (70 (v) Stables should be erected on high ground, and not, as so frequently happens, in a hollow bordering on the bed of a river. It is well known that Surra, when untreated, is an absolutely fatal malady ; the disease taking an unusually rapid course in the case of overworked animals. When once the disease is diagnosed the animal is useless. Isolation and subsequent destruction, therefore, would entail no hardship to owners; and power to enable officers to enforce it, and the burning of all diseased carcasses would be a great step towards the limitation of outbreaks. The question of the introduction of an Act to limit the spread of Surra, as in the case of Glanders, is an important one. It would be useless, however, to bring one class of animals (tonga ponies) under an Act, unless the other (ekka ponies) were likewise included; for, at present, the former only are under compulsory registration, although the latter are quite as numerous. No Government official can interfere with animals the subjects of Surra; consequently, only advice can be given to the owners as to the best means of prevention against the spread of the disease. II.71 The latent period of the disease was in no way altered by the administration of 150 grains of each of the Iodides of Mercury and Arsenic, but the course of the paroxysms was undoubtedly modified to a marked degree72 Horse Number.

(A).74 Again on the Saharanpur-Mussoorie Dâk line 77 animals died of Surra, at stations in the Mohand Pass, during the rains of 1894, when the rainfall was in considerable excess of the normal. In 1895, during the rains which were heavy, Surra caused its ravages in over 200 villages in the Karnal District, Punjáb. The losses among equines in sixteen villages in the above tahsil, where statis- tics were forthcoming, were 253 out of 556 kept or 45.50 per cent. During the same period 53 villages in the Saharanpur District, North-West Provinces, lost 909 out of a total of 1,590 or 57.10 per cent. Let us now consider the outbreaks which occur annually at the foot of the outer Himalayas at Kathgodám in the Kumaon Bhabar. At my request meteorological observations were commenced at this station in 1896, and the following table shows the information we require, but for the past two years only:75 of the disease. The distribution of this malady seems to be entirely influenced by the physical aspect of the country. It appears to be chiefly brought about by the occurrence of floods and inundations, being far more prevalent in those parts of the country where these occur than in the higher and drier portions. It is far more common in the vicinity of the rivers and canals than in portions of the country where water is scarce. It is not usual for the natives of India to make any provision for the maintenance of their animals in the form of hay or dried grass. The usual custom is either to graze their cattle where grass is to be found, or to cut it from the jungles and wastes as it is required. Towards the end of the hot season grass on the higher lands has become burnt up ; at lower levels, especially at the bottoms of nálas, swamps, and ponds, where water has been lying till a much later period, an abundant supply can generally be found, and it is from these sources that it is procured. Similar conditions operate at intervals during the wet season, or directly the rains have ceased, especially in those parts of this country where the temperature is high at this time of the year. The lands bordering on rivers and streams, or those which are low-lying, become flooded, the herbage is covered with water, which, in some cases, when the land has a clayey sub-soil, disappears almost entirely by gradual evaporation, and such places are favourable for the development of low forms of life, and possibly for the Trypanosoma. Animals, therefore, which daily consume grass and drink water from such localities run a risk of taking into their systems the contagium of this disease. In confirmation of these statements we may mention one example from many collected. The inhabitants of a village "Naoni" in the Ghaziabad Tahsil of the Meerut District, visited by Veterinary-Captain Pease in 1895, informed him that some forty out of sixty camels attacked had died out of a herd of 250. The people now drive the camels away to the Bangar or higher lying grounds during the rains, and water those animals which remain in the lowlands from wells only, in order to escape the disease. They attribute the disease to stagnant water, and do not allow their camels to drink at open places until the water has stood for a considerable time and become "pakka" (wholesome). On the other hand, Veterinary Captain G. H. Evans* reported the case of a pony which contracted Surra in a compound in Rangoon ; the grass was obtained by its attendant from any source available, while the water supplied to the animal came from the municipal supply pipes. This was the first case of Surra acquired in that city observed by the above officer during a residence of some 6 or 7 years. (III).76 (IV).77 Walker includes Hippoboscidæ under the Eproboscidæ. Loew and Sacken objected to uniting under the head of Brachycera all those families which cannot be referred to the Nemocera, especially to the union of the Hipposcidæ with the other Brachycera, since both the history of their development and their internal and external anatomy essentially differ from them. These authorities include them under a third section, Coriacea, co-ordinate to the Nemocera and Brachycera, and having the same systematic value. "The species of this family pass their egg-like and larva state in the body of the mother, and when born are pupæ or larvæ just ready to assume the pupa state, as is proved by their size, which nearly equals that of the parent fly, by their slight motion when first extruded, by spiraculiform points which run down each side of them, and by their changing into perfect flies. Each female produces a single egg. The proboscis consists of a pair of hairy coriaceous valves, which include a very slender rigid tube or siphuncle, the instrument of suction, which is formed by the union of two setiform pieces."78 The Tse-tse-fly, Glossina morsitans, is a member of this family. It is allied to Stomoxys, the species of which bite very sharply. In 1885 Railliet gave the following resumé of the history of this insect:79 and demonstrated at the Poona Laboratory in 1890. We have before pointed to the fact that when once the disease exists, its further development in other animals is frequently due to the bite of flies, which carry the soiled blood on their piercing organs. The chief question which presented itself for solution was whether the trypanosoma is ever to be found in the body fluids of flies and ticks, (i) during the hot season of the year, when it is very ex- ceptional to find a case of the disease, (ii) during the early part of the rains before the disease has manifested itself in animals. In order to elucidate the above problems it was necessary to visit the localities known to be Surra centres, during the hot season, but just before the rains usually commence at the end of May and beginning of June ; and a second time about the end of August and beginning of September, the middle of the rains, on each occasion to systematically make a very large number of microscopical observations of the different fluids to be examined. With this object in view (i) in the hot season, numerous specimens of the thoracic and abdominal fluids of the following species of Diptera were submitted to microscopical examination. (a) Large green-headed fly.80 SURRA IN BOVINES AND BUFFALOES. Surra as it affects bovines and buffaloes will be treated of under the following headings :81 most remarkable feature is the perfect harmlessness of the bite in man and wild animals, and even calves, so long as they continue to suck the cows, though it is no protection to the dog to feed on milk......... In the ox the immediate effects are no greater than in man; but, a few days after, the eyes and nose begin to run, the coat stares, a swelling appears under the jaw and sometimes at the navel, and though the poor creature continues to live and graze, emaciation commences, accompanied by a pecu- liar flaccidity of the muscles. This proceeds unchecked until perhaps, afterwards, purging comes on, and the patient dies in a state of exhaustion." To show the great ravages caused by this disease the author mentions that "Lehlunane once lost nearly the entire cattle of his tribe, amounting to many thousands, by intruding unwillingly upon the haunts of this murderous insect." Bruce states that with regard to the Tse-tse fly disease or Nagana in Zululand, that it is invariably fatal in the horse, donkey and dog, but a small percentage of cattle recover. The African disease is characterised by the constant occurrence in the blood of an infusorial parasite, either identical with or closely resembling the Trypanosoma evansi. (b).82 several cover-glass specimens of it were examined every day. Consequently two more Guinea Pigs were inoculated. These were distinguished as No. III and No. IV and each received 0.2 c.c. of blood from the bull on the 163rd day after its inoculation. Nos. III and IV Guinea Pigs both developed hæmatozoa on the 10th day, and the organisms remained almost constantly present in their blood until the day of the death, 24th October and 14th December respectively. On the 13th November 1891, that is, 234 days after the inoculation of the bull, two Guinea Pigs Nos. V and VI were inoculated with 0.2 c.c. of blood from that animal, but as no hæmatozoa, were found during the next 32 days, they were re-inoculated on the 16th December 1891, 267 days after the inocu- lation of the bull, but with negative results a second time. Between the latter date, 16th December 1891 and March 14th, 1892, the bull appeared to be enjoying good health and putting on flesh. On this latter date, that is, 356 days from the time of inoculation, two new Guinea Pigs Nos. VII and VIII were inoculated as previously with 0.2 c.c. of blood from the bull, but this experiment was also followed by negative results. Since 24th March the bull has been in very fine condition, and as it is desirable to ascertain whether animals of the bovine species are liable to a second attack of Surra, it was resolved to re-inoculate this animal with a more virulent type of Surra, obtained by passing the hæma- tozoon of the rat (Mus decumanus) through the horse and donkey. This second inoculation was per- formed on 22nd August 1892, when 1.0 c.c. of blood drawn from the jugular vein of the donkey was subcutaneously injected over the left scapular region, the blood at the time containing very numerous and active hæmatozoa. No swelling and 83 No swelling or 84 (ii) Will a calf suckling its mother, under such conditions, contract the disease ? A cow, with a calf three weeks old at her side, contracted Surra.* The blood of the mother was found to contain the hæmatozoon for a period of 120 hours. The calf was allowed to suckle three times in the 24 hours, and the milk from each teat was daily examined microscopically for the presence of the organism; but this was never discovered. On the 38th day from the appearance of the hæmatozoon in the circulation of the mother, it appeared in the blood of the offspring, which up to that date had been free. The organism remained in the circulation for 24 hours only, and had not re-appeared 123 days later. Blood in small quantities must have become mixed with the milk, owing to rupture of some small mammary vessels and by this means the hæmato- zoon entered the digestive tract of: the calf. On February 9th, 1893, the calf having grown considerably and being in good condition, it was decided to re-inoculate it, with a view to ascertain whether the animal had received any protection from the presence of the Trypanosoma in its circulation. Consequently, the same evening the calf received subcutaneously 1.0 c.c. of blood taken from the jugular vein of Horse No. LXXXIV immediately after death. No local manifestation followed the injection at the seat of the injection. The latent period occupied a little over 3 days, the hæmatozoon being present for two days, February 13th and 14th and again for one day (18th) after an intermission lasting 72 .hours. From the 18th February until September 30th, 1893, a period of 224 days, the organism was present in the blood once and then only for a few hours, viz., on the 22nd June, 123 days after its last appearance. The animal contracted rinderpest, the first symptom appearing on the 28th, and succumbed to that disease on 30th September 1893. A similar experiment with the same end in view, as in the case of its offspring, was initiated in the cow. It was re-inoculated on the 9th February 1893, with 2.0 c.c. of blood containing numerous hæmatozoa taken from the jugular vein of Horse No. LXXXIV immediately after death. The latent period occupied 8½ days, no local manifestations being observed at the seat of the injection. From the first appearance of the organism in the blood, on the 18th February 1893, until 31st May 1894, 6 paroxysms, each lasting 1 or 2 days, occurred, the hæmatozoon never exceeding two in a field of the microscope. The length of the intermissions was 10, 29, 70, 9 and 128 days, but as the examination of the blood was discontinued on May 31st, 1894, 214 days since the last appearance of the organism in the blood, it is very unlikely that the hæmatozoon would have again appeared in the circulation. On this latter date the animal was in good health and in very fair condition. SECTION III. Buffalo Surra following inoculation, including the case of Bull No. V at an elevation of 7,500 feet. Up to the time these experiments were undertaken there was no evidence forthcoming to show whether buffaloes are susceptible to the organism of Surra or not, although it was surmised that if bovines were capable of contracting the disease buffaloes would not be exempt. We had previously shown that bovines passed through an attack of Surra, and if the disease was uncomplicated with any other, the animals always survived, even when re-inoculation was resorted to after varying periods. In our previous researches, the experiments were conducted more or less in the plains ; consequently when these investigations were initiated on buffaloes in the hills, at an elevation of 7,500 feet, it was decided to ascertain concurrently what effect, if any, was produced on bovines by the change of tempera- ture, &c. The opportunity was also taken of working out certain physiological and pathological problems as far as circumstances would permit, on very much the same lines as those adopted in the case of equines, a précis of which was included in the last Report for 1895-96. In order to make this enquiry in bovines and buffaloes, the quantity and composition of the ingesta and egesta have been ascertained during a period of observation previous to inoculation, the incubatory period of the disease, and the paroxysms and intermissions until death. The following data were recorded, viz :85 7th day of the disease when it registered 37.5° C. It again rose to 40.5° C. on the 9th and remained at that point until the evening of the 10th day, when it fell to 37.4° C. The pyrexia since March 11th has been characterized by morning remissions and evening exacerbations especially on the 42nd, 49th, 58th, 102nd, 116th, and 125th day of the disease. During the months of May, June and July this animal became greatly emaciated but by during August commenced to put on flesh and fill out again. The following Table shows the length of the paroxysms and intermissions registered during the case, together with variation in numbers of hæmatozoa recorded in the paroxysms and temperature during each period.:86 Heart. 87 Left Ventricle.TABLE XXVII.

Gros * observed minute worms (vermicules) in the blood of a field-mouse (mulót) which were so numerous as to cause the blood to present an animated appearance; and that the blood of the mole was often found to be in a similar condition. The vermicules were barely visible when magnified 400 diameters. Chaussat 92 when carefully watched; the plasma constituting the thicker portion of their substance may be seen suddenly to swell out at certain places, sometimes so as to divide the body into two parts. At other times two or three such constrictions and dilatations may be detected, the dilatations being possibly observable only on one side, at other times they assume an arrow-shaped aspect. Occasionally something like granularity may be observed before their disappearance, but not a trace of them is left after their disintegration : it seems as though they had been dissolved in the serum in which they were found. The width of the anterior half or body portion averages .008 to .001 m.m. and its length from .020 to .030 m.m. or an average of .025 m.m. The flagellum, so much of it as is visible, is somewhat of the same length, so that the total length of the organism equals about .050 m.m. or 1/500". The last, however, may be considerably longer than this, as the slope from the body portion is very gradual, and when the eye follows it to the bounds of visibility, an impression is conveyed that there may be still more of it, beyond the power of either Ross 1/12" or Powell and Lealand's 1/16" to reveal. Wittich* described similar organisms in the blood of badgers in Germany. Wittich's observations coincided with Lewis' as regards their being found in the blood of apparently perfectly healthy animals, though Koch93 organism. I, like Dr. Lewis, gained the impression that it commonly advanced ; yet it is certain that when more tranquilly performed, progression is really with the flagellate extremity in front, as is usual in the other infusorial monads.

Bull No. IV102 cutaneously inoculated with 1.0 c.c. of blood, containing very numerous hæmatozoa, taken from the rat (Mus decumanus) immediately after death. A swelling, tense and tender on manipulation, was noticed at the seat of inoculation, which gradually subsided in the course of ten days. During the period of obser- vation, the temperature varied between a maximum of 39.8° and a minimum of 35.4°C. From the time of inoculation until death, which occurred on the 5th May 1893, the temperatures varied between 39.4° and 35°C.; and during the last twenty days of life it became of a markedly intermittent type, the morning and evening registration showing a difference of from 3 to 3.5 degrees Centigrade (5.4 to 6.3°F.). Although the blood of this animal was submitted twice daily to microscopical examination, the hæmatozoon was never discovered, moreover, no symptom in any way pointing to the existence of such a disease became manifest during the course of the case. Two Guinea Pigs, however, were each inoculated with 0.5 c. c. of blood, taken from the heart of the donkey, at 11-30 A.M. on the 5th May 1893, three hours and 45 minutes after death, in which no organisms could be found. No. (i) Guinea Pig.103 No. II was inoculated subcutaneously on the 7th December 1890, with 0.2 c.c. of blood from a similar source to No. I. No symptom of any kind was noticed until 8th March 1891, when the animal presented a muco-purulent discharge running from both nostrils, and the eyelids glued together caused by the drying of the purulent secretion coming from them. Several peculiar-shaped bodies were observed in the blood on the 12th April, but the hæmatozoon was never discovered in it. The animal eventually regained its normal health. Result negative.

Description of Experimental Researches, and Results of the same obtained at Poona. In 1890, as no statistics were forthcoming with regard to the percentage of rats which contained the 'Trypanosoma' in their blood, it was determined to make a careful microscopical examination of the blood of as many of these animals as possible. The results arrived at were as follows. From November 1890 to May 1892, the blood of 349 rats was examined microscopically, hæmato- zoa were found present in 106, and absent in 234, giving a percentage of 30.37 present, 69.63 absent. At a later date the elucidation of further details was required, especially with regard to the num- ber of organisms present in the circulation of each individual animal. Naturally, when the number of organisms had to be determined, the easiest way would have been to use one of the Hæmocytometers for that purpose, but in practice it was found to be useless, for when very few parasites were present in the circulation of an animal, it frequently happened that although several could be observed in cover-glass preparations of blood, none could be found in the small quan- tity used for examination with the Hæmocytometer. Consequently, the number of parasites present in the samples of blood examined were expressed in terms of few (1 in a specimen to 5 in each field of the microscope with Zeiss Ocular IV, and Objective D), numerous (5 to 20), very numerous (20 to 50) and swarming over 50 in each field. The Trypanosoma in several fields of the microscope were counted and the mean taken. In this way from June 1892 to July 1894, the blood of 758 rats was submitted to examination with the following results:113 Month. Absent. Few. Nume- rous. Very nume- rous. Swarm- ing. Absent.

July to October inclusive, and during the remaining months the percentage gradually decreased until April was reached. The difference between the maximum 46.78, and the minimum 23.47, percentages in July and April respectively, is 23.31 or nearly half (50 per cent.) B 2204114 TABLE XXXII.

From our observations, the spleen attains its maximum size towards the end of the rains, and from that period the size of the organ gradually diminishes during the dry and hot season, until the advent of the following monsoon, unless occasional heavy rain falls between Nov- ember and May. It has been observed during the middle of the hot and dry season that when rain suddenly falls after a long period of drought (4 months), the percentage of animals in which the hæmatozoon is found increases rapidly in the first few days (7) following the fall. The percentage then rapidly falls, and a second maximum is reached during the fourth week. The increase of percentage in the first week was found to be 7.5, while the maximum in the fourth week was 11.0 per cent. The presence in varying numbers of the hæmatozoon in the circulation of rats does not appear to produce any noticeable symptoms in the great majority of them. But some few rats, whose blood swarmed with the hæmatozoon, have succumbed to leucocytosis, with extravasations of blood, containing the organism, into the anterior chamber and vitrous humours of the eye, opacity of the cornea, enlarged spleens, and extravasations of blood, or in some cases ulceration of the mucous membrane of the stomach. Several observers have stated that rats in whose blood, the hæmatozoon is found, do not appear to show any pathological changes, as a consequence of the presence of such organism in their circulation. There is no doubt, however, that a considerable increase in the size of the liver and spleen takes place and frequently a certain degree of fatty degeneration of the former. The following table shows the ratio found to exist in the different classes between the weight of the spleen and that of the body, in a total of 2,126 rats examined:115 It will be seen from the above table that the ratio of the spleen to body weight increased, from a minimum in the absent cases, in regular gradation, according to the number of hæmatozoa present in the circulation of the rats. The percentage increase in weight of the spleen in males and females under 60 grammes with the hæmatozoon in their blood was 60 per cent, while in those over 60 grammes it was 73 per cent., above the average weight of the spleen in rats, whose circulation was free from the organism. About 60 per cent. of young rats from two to four months old, weighing up to 60 grammes, have the hæmatozoon present in their circulation, and usually in large numbers. The hæmatozoon of the rat appears and disappears from the circulation at irregular intervals, thus producing paroxysms and intermissions, as is the case with the Surra Trypanosoma in equines, bovines and other animals.

Immediately, however, a slight wound of the mucous membrane of the mouth was made, the organisms were discovered in varying numbers according to the amount of blood mixed with the saliva. The hæmatozoon was always found absent from the urine of rats, although swarming in the circula- tion at the time of collection. It has been observed in a considerable number of cases that although the hæmatozoon may be present in vast numbers in the blood of pregnant rats, in no case has the organism been discovered in the circulation of the f116 I.117 (i) Horse Surra is enzootic in Bombay with an average rainfall of 72.7 inches, and mean yearly humidity of 81 per cent. of saturation; but the reverse is the case in Poona, on the Deccan plateau at an elevation of 1,857 feet, with an average rainfall of 27.6 inches, and mean yearly humidity of 53 per cent, of saturation. (ii) It is a well ascertained fact, and the statistics in this and Volume I, furnish the proof, that in Bombay the deaths from Surra as a rule commence in August or September, and new cases practically cease at the end of December. Consequently, this experiment was undertaken at too late a period of the year, and any future experiment in this line should be undertaken in Bombay, or at all events below the ghâts, towards the end of the hot weather, and continued through the rain, if necessary. (iii) Another point which has been noticed in animals submitted to inoculation with rat's blood is that the hæmatozoon in the blood of rats (kept for any time in captivity, and fed on clean corn, &c.) appears to lose in virulence. The positive cases which have been recorded in horses in this report were inoculated with blood taken from rats which had been caught only a few hours previous to their blood being used for the pur- pose of inoculation. Some species of rats are very clean feeders, viz., Nesokia providens, but the Mus decumanus of this country is not so, and eats any food which is procurable; when no grain is obtainable, it having recourse to offal and fæcal matter. For the above reasons, it was deemed advisable to make further experiments with the same end in view118 SECTION IV. REMARKS ON SOME SYMPTOMS OF SURRA IN ANIMALS, FOLLOWING INOCULATION OF SOILED RAT'S BLOOD. ANALYSIS OF THE PRINCIPAL SYMPTOMS. (a).119 days. The temperature varied between 37.2°C. and 40.4°C. A second invasion of the eruption occurred between the 34th and 44th day of the disease. At first the rash was confined to the thighs, but later appeared over the whole body. The animal had been subjected to treatment with Arsenic, and the first appearance of the second attack coincided with the first day of the second paroxysm. For the first two days the temperature was high, 40.2°C., but for the last eight, the thermometer recorded a maximum of 37.6°C. A third attack of urticaria was noticed on the 82nd and 83rd days of the disease. On this occasion the eruption selected the chest, fore-limbs and thighs, and the temperature remained very low, viz., 36.2°C., maximum 37.4°C. A fourth time the rash made its appearance on the 99th and 100th day of the disease, two days before a paroxysm, but it faded immediately the hæmatozoon made its appearance in the blood. The temperature varied between 38.2° and 39.4°C. We found that the urticarial eruption in the two naturally acquired cases of Horse Surra previously reported occurred on the first day of the disease, and was of the form known as ' urticaria evanida.' In the experimental cases of the same disease the conclusion arrived at was that the rash might show itself any time from 18 hours after inoculation until the 22nd day after the appearance of the organism in the blood. In the observations conducted with the rat trypanosoma we find that in the three animals, two of which Nos. LXII and IX contracted the disease by the subcutaneous inoculation of soiled blood, in the former the eruption appeared concurrently with the hæmatozoon on the first day of the disease, and in the latter on the 3rd day of the disease. In horse No. XCI, fed on rat excrement mixed with the ration of corn, the urticarial eruption was the first symptom which drew attention to the animal's condition; on this occasion it persisted for eight days, but returned for a period of ten days between the 34th and 44th days and again for 48 hours on the 82nd and 83rd days and yet again on the 99th and 100th days of the disease. In both horses LVIII and LXIX the eruption remained visible for 12 hours in each case, on the second day of the disease, and in horse XIII it broke out on the fourth day for 12 hours, and again remained patent for 72 hours between the 15th and 18th days of disease. Out of the first 55 cases of Horse Surra under observation the urticarial eruption appeared in 12 or 21.81 per cent, while in the 19 cases now recorded in equines, directly or indirectly derived from the rat, it showed itself in 6 or 31.58 per cent.

Massing the returns under their respective headings, we find that in the case of the former the ratio of spleen to body-weight is as 1 : 208 ; while in the case of the latter, it is 1: 272. That is, the average weight of the spleen in bandicoots which have the Trypanosoma present in their circulation is 23.53 per cent. heavier than in animals of the same species whose blood is healthy. In individual cases the spleen has been found to be 9 or 10 times the normal size. For a shorter period, the statistics with regard to the ratio of liver to body-weight have been fur- nished for 47 bandicoots in which the hæmatozoa were present in 17, and absent in 30 animals. In the former the ratio was as 1: 22.5, and in the latter as 1 : 24.6, or a difference of 8.54 per cent. SECTION VI. INJECTION OF BANDICOOT SERUM INTO SMALL ANIMALS WITH A VIEW TO PRODUCING A RESISTANCE TO THE INOCULATED TRYPANOSOMA OF HORSE SURRA. Experiments were conducted with a view to determine whether repeated injections of bandicoot serum subcutaneously would have any deterrent effect upon the presence and growth of the ha3matozoon of Surra in the circulation of Rabbits and Guinea Pigs. For this purpose small animals were inocu- B 2204134 lated with the soiled blood of Surra horses, and on the day following inoculation, bandicoot was subcutaneously injected, and the doses repeated at varying intervals of 24 to 72 hours. The serum was collected from old and full-grown bandicoots, as it was recognised that during their life these animals pass through repeated periods, during which several varieties of hæmatozoa are present in their circula- tion. Consequently full-grown bandicoots with hæmatozoa were kept under observation until the organisms had disappeared from their blood. They were then killed, and the blood collected, the serum being allowed to separate. The following cases in the Rabbit and Guinea Pig are typical of the results produced :135 TABLE XLII.

The difficulty of obtaining bandicoots was considerable, and out of 15 caught in December, 1894, only two presented the hæmatozoon in their circulation :137 TABLE XLIV.

PART V. SURRA AS OBSERVED IN SPONTANEOUS CASES AND AFTER INOCULATION IN THE BANDICOTE.
141 For a number of years past, imported English dogs, especially Fox-hounds and Fox-terriers, have been found to contract disease and succumb to it, during the first twelve months' residence in this country. The island of Bombay and that portion of the Presidency below the Gháts has proved a hot- bed of this disease, but other localities inland have not been free, for at Poona, elevation 1,849 ft., Mhow, 2,019 ft., and Ootacamund, at an elevation of 8,000 feet, several severe epidemics among hounds have occurred. SECTION I. HISTORY OF PREVIOUS OUTBREAKS OF SPONTANEOUS OR ACQUIRED SURRA. The first records of heavy mortality in imported Fox-hounds are those of the Ootacamund Kennels in 1869-70. The chief symptoms then noticed were142 TABLE XLV. Showing certain details concerning a number of hounds which contracted Surra at and around Bandora during the commencement of 1893. Number. Name.

Five dogs (four hounds and a fox-terrier) were bitten by a hyæna, during a run on the 8th January 1893. All the five went blind between the 7th and 26th March (the 58th and 77th days), and their several deaths took place between the 12th March and 16th April (63rd to 98th day following the bite). Although the huntsman thought the hyæna bites of some importance, there is no doubt, the deaths were post hoc and not propter hoc. The animals hunted were foxes, jackals, and hyænas. A point of consider- able interest with regard to the way in which the animals contracted the disease was contributed by one hound, which always took part in the runs, but absolutely refused to join in the kills. This animal re- mained in perfect health, and was alive and in good health sixteen months later (July 1894). On March 18th, 1893, eight couple of hounds, which on that date appeared in perfect health, were despatched from the Kennels to Ootakamund by sea viâ Calicut, in order to try the effect of the cool atmosphere of the Hills. The results were, however, disastrous, for one died during the journey, two became blind on the journey and died a few days after their arrival, three died on the 16th and two on the 21st April, and four succumbed during the next few weeks. So that, out of sixteen hounds sent to Ootakamund, twelve died, and out of the whole pack three only remained healthy. Probably some jackals and foxes suffer from Surra, for in 1893, several of the former appeared in- capable of running far, and when put up by the hounds, were caught within ten minutes, their bodies being afterwards devoured. A certain amount of carrion was picked up by the hounds during their runs; and one animal left the pack and returned to the Kennels during the following night, gorged with carrion. This animal was the first to present Surra symptoms, and died after an illness lasting 31 days. In February 1894, Surra broke out in the Mhow pack ; and several hounds were shot, after mi- croscopical examination of their blood had been made for diagnostic purposes. The remainder of the pack were then sent down to Bombay, on the 15th February, and shipped the same evening to Calicut, en route for Ootakamund. Two of them, however, succumbed to the disease on the way from Bombay ; the rest survived. In 1894, Veterinary Captain G. H. Evans stated that a large number of Pariah dogs were destroy- ed in the city of Mandalay on account of Surra, Veterinary Captain H. T. Pease, during his 1895-96 tour in the Punjáb, found that many of the villages in the Karnal District had lost a great number of their dogs from Surra, in addition to equines. In some villages, in fact, there was scarcely one remaining. The Canines appear to have contracted the malady through eating diseased carcasses. SECTION II. A.143 The symptoms noted were paroxysmal fever, temperature running up to 106.5° F., accompanied by the usual symptoms of fever; in some few cases opacity of the cornea, and more rarely extravasation of blood into the anterior chamber of the eye supervened late in the course of the disease. The blood was mi- croscopically examined daily, but the Surra organism was never discovered. These animals suffered, shortly before death, from a gangrenous condition of the integuments of the feet; and the emaciated condition of their bodies is difficult to describe. Early in 1893, and during the before-mentioned epidemic among the Bombay Fox-hounds and Fox-terriers, I was requested to visit the Kennels at Bandora, in order to investigate the disease on the spot. The symptoms noted in their sequence were, paroxysmal fever, anorexia ; at a later date, swelling of the integument about the head and throat ; injection of the conjunctival membranes ; increased lachrymation, in some cases, effusion into the joints, and marked 144 B.145 Autopsy.146 SECTION III.

The maximum temperature 40.5°C. was registered during the third intermission, and the minimum 38.2°C. during the first paroxysm.
