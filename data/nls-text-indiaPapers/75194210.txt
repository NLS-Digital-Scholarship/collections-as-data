171 The left ventricle is contracted. The muscular tissue of the wall measures at its greatest width 1.8 inches and its cavity is almost empty. The internal surface presents numerous sub-endocardial extravasations, somewhat extensive in certain situations, especially involving the tissues lying behind the posterior segment of the mitral valve and the upper por- tions of the musculi-papillares, and there are smaller ones studded over the muscular surface of the cavity. The valves are healthy. The abdominal cavity contains a few ounces of a turbid, orange fluid. The Liver is small and dark in colour. It weighs 7 lbs 6½ ozs. The convex surface of both lobes shows signs of old perihepatitis. On section, the tissue is dark in colour, and dark fluid blood exudes from the cut ends of the vessels. The Spleen is normal in size ; the surfaces are studded with numerous brick-red sub-capsular petechiæ, which present an almost confluent appearance at the free borders. On section, the tissues present a dark purple-red colour. Follicles normal in size. The Kidneys.172 HORSE No. XCI. POSITIVE RESULT. Australian Gelding, aged, in very fine condition, was cast on account of lameness. The question as to how rats could cause the disease in horses was raised ; for the food would rarely, if ever, be soiled with the blood of these animals. It therefore only remained to be tried whether the excreta of rats, in whose blood the infusorian was present at the time of its collection, could cause the disease when mixed with grain. An experiment with this end in view had already been undertaken at Poona, on the Deccan plateau, where the disease is not enzootic, and where the difficulty of producing it was fully recognised, owing to the dryness of the situation at that period of the year (December to February). These experiments as expected proved negative. Consequently it was deemed advisable to make further experiments with the same end in view in Bombay, where the climate is favourable from its humidity, and the disease is enzootic. Two horses (Nos. LXXXIX and XCI) were therefore transported on May 6th, 1893, to Bombay and through the courtesy of Major J. Mills were located at the Veterinary College Hospital. A regular supply of rats was main- tained, principally from the Bandora Kennels, and their blood was examined daily. The rats, in the blood of which the hæmatozoon was discovered, were placed in wire cages over a metal plate, so that the excrement would fall through into the receptacle and be forthcoming when required. Morning and evening the excrement was collected, weighed, and a known quantity mixed with the ration of corn previous to its being given to the animals under experiment. The results of the experiment in the case of Horse No. LXXXIX proved negative. Month and Date. Temperature °C. Pulse. Respiration. Temperature in Shade °F. Humidity. Condition of Blood. REMARKS. A.M.
