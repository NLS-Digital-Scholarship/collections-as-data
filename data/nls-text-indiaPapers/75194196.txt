Report on ' Surra' disease in the Dera Ismail Khan District, November 13th, 1880, Military Depart- ment, No. 4932 The presence of the Infugorian is. not continuous during the whole course of the disease. At first it is usually found in small numbers in the blood, and increases with greater or less rapidity, until having attained a maximum, it dis- appears either gradually or suddenly to re-appear after an interval. The periods during which it is present in, and absent from the blood, are marked by extreme irregularity, varying from one to six days, but the latter number is very unusual. The disease is invariably fatal; death being generally due to exhaustion, but sometimes to concurrent complications. After death no specific lesion is pre- sent, but as a rule there are small sub-pleural and sub-endocardial extravasa- tions, together with enlargement of the liver and spleen, and if death takes place during a paroxysm, the hæmatozoon will be found for a certain time in the blood. SECTION II. NOMENCLATURE. "According to Evans the name ' Surra' is used by the natives to denote anything rotten, and is applied by them to a dry-rot, such as a withered leaf, and to a moist rot, such as a putrid carcass. The name is thus a very comprehensive one, and is applied loosely to all chronic ailments of a lowering character which have not a specific designation. A native will speak of himself as Sur gia (gone rotten), when he has felt for some time in ill-health and does not know what he suffers from. The name ' Surra' is given to this disease among horses as a distinctive designation, because a withering or falling off in condition is a marked feature in its progress without any visible lesion post mortem to account for it." SECTION III. HISTORICAL ACCOUNT OF SURRA. Our first knowledge of this disease was communicated by *Evans, in a report dated November 1880, to the Government of India. The malady, he designated ' Surra,' and defined it as a specific, parasitical, non-inflammatory, enzootic, blood disease, characterized by fever, jaundice, petechiæ of the mucous membrane, especially of the eye and vagina, dropsy, sometimes albumen in the urine, great prostration of strength and rapid wasting, and with a specific parasite in the blood during life ; but no characteristic structural organic lesions are found after death. It may be transmitted by the subcutaneous injection of blood, and by drinking fresh blood containing the live parasites, but is not contagious or infectious in the ordinary way. The average duration of the disease is probably less than two months, but reliable statistics are wanting upon that point. He describes the invasion of the disease acquired in the ordinary way as that com- mon to all low fevers. In a small majority of cases the sub-maxillary gland may be enlarged and tender ; in a large proportion of cases the legs are swollen and 3 There is often much anæmic palpitation of the heart in the last stage, and the membranes become blanched : some animals drop down and die suddenly, perhaps when eating, others become delirious and struggle on the ground, while other animals linger for days after they are helped up, but go on eating grass and corn until they die. Evans noted a certain amount of clear serum in the peritoneal cavity, but no sign of any inflammatory action. In one case the pericardial sac was dis- tended with fluid. He says " that when he first saw the parasite, he thought for a moment, it was some form of Spirillum, but rapidly changed his mind on that point. It has an apparently round body when it is fresh and active, which tapers in front forming a neck, ending in a blunt head, and behind it has a tapering tail from which there extends a long slender lash, so fine that it can seldom be seen. It had two fin-like papillæ on each side, one pair placed near the neck, and one near the tail. He only occasionally saw the four at once, and they always ap- peared to occupy the same relative positions. He describes the parasite as being wonderfully active, and presenting un- dulatory eel-like movements ; it has the power of altering its shape, progressing almost always in the direction of the blunt end, though it is able to go in the reverse manner when pulling a corpuscle. He examined the kidneys, liver, spleen, heart, lungs, and the mucous lining of the stomach and intestines throughout, with great care, and stated positively that this disease is not charac- terized by any structural organic change ; it is purely a disease of the blood. Petechias were noticed on the mucous lining of the intestines in some cases, but in no case was the structure of the liver diseased. The disease is absolutely fatal to horses, mules and camels. There is no evidence to show that the disease is either contagious or infec- tious in the ordinary sense ; the weight of evidence is to the contrary. Seventy- seven horses of the 3rd Panjab Cavalry became affected at Jutta, and were taken to Edwardabad and all died, but did not communicate the disease to others. He considers that when horses are closely packed together, a large fly called " Burradhang " may inoculate healthy animals with the blood of the diseased. Evans submitted a puppy, inoculated with Surra parasites transferred from the horse, to Dr. Lewis for his opinion. Lewis reported that " the parasites appeared to be very closely allied to the flaggellated variety, which were detected by himself in a considerable number of apparently healthy rats, but he could not then venture to express an opinion as to whether they were specifically identical." Major Money, 4th Panjab Cavalry, stated that the disease was common amongst the horses of the 3rd Panjab Cavalry when they obtained the grass from inundated ground near the River Indus, but it ceased when they got grass from higher ground. The outbreak takes place usually in August, but more in September, and continues until January when it suddenly ceases. Treatment.4 differed from it sufficiently to warrant his considering them as local varieties of the same disease. Steele carefully watched and recorded the symptoms of the disease, confirm- ing and adding to those previously described by Evans. He communicated the disease to the mule, pony, dog and monkey, but was unsuccessful in his trials to inoculate bullocks and goats. He found that the size of the parasite varies in different cases ; usually 1/6th the diameter, and 3 to 6 times the length of a red blood corpuscle. In the fresh state it is an eel-like body ; dried and stained it looks like an oxyuris on a small scale, with a thick portion in its body, and a spiral tail. The body portion tapers in either direction ; anteriorly it terminates rather abruptly and is somewhat rigid, and there is apparently a hold-fast organ at the blunt extremity. He describes the movements as being eel-like, lashing and vermiform, less frequently spiral, and believes the parasite to be a form of spirilloid, closely related to the spirillum found in relapsing fever in man. He concludes by defining the disease thus :5 amongst the horses and baggage animals of the 19th Bengal Lancers. These observations were made under the personal supervision of Inspecting Veterinary- Surgeon W. T. Russell, 2nd Circle, at the present time the Principal Veterinary- Officer in India. The outbreak in 1886 commenced on the 3rd July, and terminated on the 22nd December of the same year. During this period 48 animals succumbed to the disease, viz., 25 horses and 23 grass-cutters' ponies, thirteen and six of each respectively having died, the remainder being destroyed. For those animals which died, the average number of days of the disease was for horses 36, and for ponies 6. The outbreak of 1887 extended over 151 days, from September 6th, 1887, to February 4th, 1888, and attacked horses, ponies and mules. Forty-seven in all died or were destroyed. Veterinary-Surgeon Steele happened to be in Meerut at the time of the epidemic, and at once recognised the disease as Surra, organisms having been discovered at a later date in the blood of 15 out of 20 animals examined. It is of interest to notice that seven other animals were discovered suffering from fever, with yellow and petechial condition of the conjunctivae, and a more or less degree of constitutional disturbance, (symptoms frequently recognised by us in Poona, and by G. H. Evans in Burmah), but these animals were not affected with Surra and recovered after a few days. The outbreaks in Meerut as in other localities have occurred only at a- special time of the year, i.e., from the rainy season well into the cold weather, and up to the present time there are no sporadic cases on record as having occurred at this station at other times of the year. The deaths during this period were in September, 10, October, 26, November, 7, December, 2, and January, 2, The average number of days of disease in cases that died, being for horses 52, ponies 30, and mules 19. In this series of cases, the Surra parasite was found in the blood at different periods of the disease in 43 out of the 47 attacked. Veterinary-Surgeon Nuttall apparently experienced the same difficulty in determining the exact commencement of the attacks in animals as has been found by other investigators. All attempts at curative treatment were negative. As regards the post-mortem appearances of the stomach, Mr. Nuttall states " that it may be found in some instances replete with food, in others a little partly digested blood-stained material, fibrinous clots, &c.; and the organ usually the seat of special lesions ; which may be ulceration or erosion either of the cuticular or villous portions, usually confined to the former, extending in some cases to perforation ; the villous portion in places denuded of the epithelial lining, resulting from degenerative changes, and yellow pigmentation of varying intensity is constantly seen." In the appendix to the report, it is stated that gastric lesions were found in the case of 25 horses, 15 ponies and 2 mules. * Ranking published in June 1891 a preliminary report, in which he states his opinion, that Surra is a disease of malarial origin comparable to ague, and that this view of the pathology of " Surra " is borne out both by the period of prevalence of " Surra" which corresponds with that of ague, and also by the results of treatment. Quinine in full doses appears to control the disease, sup- plemented by general measures to combat the anæmia and weakness consequent on prolonged illness, chiefly by milk, iron and arsenic. He believes that the facts put now on record will, if followed as guides to diagnosis, enable the disease to be detected in the earliest stages, when it may be rapidly cured ; the reason why " Surra " has hitherto been so uniformly fatal he believes to be simply because its real nature was not apprehended, and the disease allowed to run on till the vital powers were sapped by the constantly recurring fever. * Ranking George, M.D.6 * Giles investigated several cases which occurred at the latter end of an outbreak in Shillong, which from first to last resulted in the loss of between sixty to seventy animals. The disease described by this observer was certainly not ' Surra,' but was due to the presence of the sclerostomum tetracanthum. As early as 1865, Franck and Fischer working independently published papers dealing with the anæmia, hæmorrhagic enteritis, and fatal colics produced by these nematodes. Lieutenant J. Baldwin, R.A., has given the following information re Surra in Burmah. A section of No. 6 Bombay Mountain Battery left Bhamo in January 1891, and took part in the Wuntha expedition. [Wuntha is noted for the prevalence of Surra.] No deaths occurred during the expedition and the section returned to Bhamo at the beginning of April. In May several of those animals which had had the hardest work during the expedition, i. e. the baggage mules, suffered for two or three days from high fever. They apparently recovered but fell off slightly in condition. In June they had another attack of greater severity. In July the same thing occurred, the animals becoming greatly debi- litated. During this month the attacks came on once a week, and this con- tinued through August ; all the symptoms clearly indicated Surra. In September four of the mules died, in October six, and in November five. This left only seven out of the original twenty-two baggage mules; of these seven mules, three had suffered from intermittent attacks of fever, and four appeared to be quite healthy. These seven mules started on another expedition in December 1891, and seemed at first to be picking up and doing well; however in January 1892, two of them were again attacked with disease in so virulent a form, that in the space of a week they were unable to stand, and had to be destroyed. The third mule had to be destroyed on the 1st April 1892 ; the remaining four mules were never sick, and are still working. It will be seen from the above that " supposing the disease to have been contracted in Wuntha, which appears probable, as no other animals were attacked in Bhamo," the disease in one case lasted at least a year before a fatal termination. On the expedition above referred to, which started in December 1891, the number of animals exceeded 400 ; there were among these only two other fatal cases, one from tetanus, the other from an accident. The same officer also states, that from August 1890 to August 1891 the Chinese traders brought 6,500 mules to Bhamo from Yunnan. Fifteen hundred of these animals died of Surra in Burmah, and five thousand were left to make the return journey. On the return of the traders to Bhamo in the following year, and on their being questioned as to the condition of the animals which made the journey in the previous year to Yunnan, it was elicited that all of the animals, 5,000 in number, succumbed to disease either whilst on the march, or on their arrival in Chinese territory. The traders further stated, that all mules brought by them from Yunnan on their last journey were entirely fresh animals, which had not been over the same ground in a previous expedition.

7 branes,and petechiæ on the conjuntivæ, with rapid loss of condition and occurrence of relapses ; and this is no doubt very frequently confounded with Surra. Evans has often been asked to destroy cases of this description, but from the experience gained in an outbreak in 1890, he was led to discard all other symp- toms as a proof of the existence of Surra, and base his diagnosis solely on the presence of the hæmatozoon in the blood." " In post mortem examinations of Surra-subjects, ulcers in various stages are present in the majority of cases, shallow, deep, or small as the case may be. They present the appearance, which may perhaps be conveyed best by the effect produced by a cockroach eating the surface of a patent leather boot." " Spiroptera nests are by no means invariably found in the stomach ; in fact they appear to be much rarer in Burmah than in the Bombay Presidency." The Panthés, who are great mule-breeders across our Frontiers, state that Surra kills a great number of their mules every season, in the valleys between the Frontier and Yunnan. The same people also state that Surra prevails in certain parts of the North and South Shan States. In Burmah the stations where the greatest mortality has occurred are as follows :8 To sum up the number of horses kept at Parel is less than one-third of that kept at Colába ; the interior sanitary arrangements at the former are superior to those at the latter ; the record of fever cases at the former has up to November last compared most favourably with that at the latter ; the tempera- ture at the former averages 2° lower than at the latter. Notwithstanding all these facts to the credit of Parel, 10 horses have been attacked there during the recent outbreak of Surra against 4 horses attacked at Colába stables. Feed and water-supply.9 plague. The innumerable quantity of those insects in the air indicated some- thing unusual in the climatic conditions, or in the condition of the marshes which skirt Bombay. The weather commenced to get cooler in November, and in the middle of December cold north-east and north-west winds set in, and* have since continued, the former blowing during the night, and the latter during the day. Breed of the Horses attacked.10 watering, or the drainage of their stables which would account for the outbreak. All these conditions, in so far as they affect the horses' health, have been, to the best of our belief, precisely the same these last four months, as during the many past years when " Surra " was unknown to us. We, therefore, seem directed to seek in some special climatic and atmospheric conditions for the explanation of the outbreak. October and November last were notoriously exceptionally unhealthy months in Bombay. Malarial and typhoid fevers were prevalent, and many cases ended fatally. Unusually unhealthy months for human beings, they would appear to have been unusually unhealthy for horses also. The outbreak of " Surra " fever was not confined to the Company's stables. Several horses attacked with it were sent to the Government Veterinary Hospital, and others to the private veterinary establishments in the city. Probably, a far larger number died in their owners' stables. Amongst the cases observed we have not heard of a single recovery. Taking all the above facts into consideration, the opinion we have been led to form is that there was some specially unhealthy influence in the atmospheric conditions this last autumn, which pre- disposed horses to this particular blood-poisoning fever, and that the specific cause which developed the disease into activity in the' horses attacked with it, was getting chilled from exposure to the cold northerly winds, which during the latter half of November and. the month of December blew in the evening and at night. This is the conclusion to which we have been led as the result of our own experience of the disease. In support of this opinion we have the following facts :11 is, in this way, introduced. In other words, the train produces a sort of arti- ficial wind. The track of the G. I. P. Railway passes immediately behind our Parel premises, distant only 75 feet from the stables. About 2,000 feet further to the north the flats commence and are crossed by the trains. In this memo- randum we are anxious to enumerate all possible influences which may have served in the production of the recent outbreak of Surra. It is perhaps worthy of consideration whether the G. I. P.. Railway track, which very shortly after leaving the marshy land of the flats passes our Parel stables on their north- western side, does not act as an air-channel from the one to the other. The line of horses standing next to the railway was the line in which the "Surra" was by far the most prevalent. A conjecture has been put forward by some veterinary authorities in India that there is a connection between "Surra" and rats. A parasite has been found in the intestines of rats, which is similar to the parasite noticed in the blood of horses suffering from Surra. It is suggested that where rats have access to grain, it becomes contaminated with their excreta, and that when used for horses' feed, the parasite may in that way be conveyed into the horses' stomachs. In view of this theory we think it right to mention that although the greater portion of our grain is. kept in paved godowns, and we do our best to. exclude rats, yet, we know that both before and after the grain is received by us rats do frequently get at it. But before our grain is used for horses' feed, it is carefully cleaned both by hand and through a machine. We ourselves cannot, from our own observation, favour the rat infection theory. If the source of the disease is due to grain getting mixed with the excreta of rats, why is the appearance of the fever limited to certain seasons and why should it appear only in certain years. For the past 14 years it has been unknown in our stables and during those years our stocks of grain and hay have been less well- protected from the incursions of rats than they have been the past 12 months. We have now. we think, exhausted all we are in a position to state with regard to our own experience of " Surra " fever. We submit these few remarks on a veterinary subject as proceeding of course from a non-professional pen, and while we trust to be pardoned any mistakes into which we may in consequence have fallen, we hope that our experience may be of value to those who are making this disease a subject of special study. As a large owner of horses this Company is deeply interested in researches which have for their object the discovery of a remedy for this most fatal form of equine fever.

GEOGRAPHICAL RANGE. The geographical range of this disease is much wider than it was once imagined, and is one of the most important diseases affecting equines met with in India. According to Evans, the natives of Dera Ismail Khan on the north- western frontier east of the Indus have known this disease for several genera- tions as an occasional scourge. It has now been recognized all along the low country bordering the Indus. In the seventies at Asni near Rajanpore, one
16 Cavalry regiment (3rd P. 0.) lost 350 horses. In the late war it caused enorm- ous mortality among horses, mules and ponies used in Upper Burma, and according to Steele ninety-eight per cent. died from it, and Komree. Surra is endemic in the island of Bombay, and has been frequently recognized in animals in the low district lying below the western gháts, called the Konkan, and less frequently in other parts of this vast continent, separated from each other by many hundreds of miles, viz., in the Berars, in Meerut, and other parts of the North-Western Provinces, as well as in Assam and Cachar. Blanchard recog- nized this disease in Tonquin among the transport mules belonging to the French Government. In 1876 a disease was pointed out to Haig in Persia, which he was told was invariably fatal, the cause of which the natives ascribed to the animal's drinking impure water. On Haig's return to India he became acquainted with Surra, and then recognized that the Persian animals were affected with all the outward symptoms of that disease. There are reasons for believing that animals have succumbed to this disease in Abyssinia, and probably also in Southern Europe, North America, Brazil, East Africa, and Australia, SECTION V.

Breed.49 At Dera Ismail Khan (elevation 571 feet) and Kohat, both on the North- western Frontier the rainfall is small, about 8 inches, the relative humidity has a mean of about 50, the temperature varying between a mean maximum of 107° F. in June, and 72° in December, But Dera is situated on the banks of the river Indus, which is subject to extensive floods during the rainy season, when the whole neighbourhood becomes one vast lake, and at a later period on the subsidence of the waters, the land is left covered with. mud. And lastly Meerut, with an elevation of 7.37 feet, which has a rainfall of 28.5 inches, with a relative humidity of 57 per cent. and a mean maximum tempe- rature of 112° F. It will thus be seen from the foregoing details, that the localities in which Surra is endemic belong to two distinct kinds of climates, The one with a heavy rainfall, high temperature, and humid, steamy atmosphere ; the other with a dry arid neighbourhood, presenting a great annual range of temperature. But in both classes of localities, inundation of land during the rains leaves the fields covered with mud at a later date, and evaporation and concentration of the water in the tanks during the hot season.* 2. Residence in a locality where the disease is endemic. Table IX shows the length of residence in Bombay of eighty animals, the subjects of Surra, which have been worked out and tabulated from exact details kept by the Tramway Company. From these figures it will be observed, that the residence of the animals attacked ranged over a period of from under one year to thirteen years, and that out of this number the largest proportion, viz., 16.25 per cent. occurred in animals which had only been in the country for varying periods of under one year. Further it will be seen, that sixty-one out of the eighty cases of animals brought forward, or 76.25 per cent. succumbed within the first seven of the fourteen years under observation. TABLE IX.

Months of the year. Table X shows the number of cases of Surra, which have occurred in the Bombay Tramway Stables during the past five years, together with a few cases which have been received at the Laboratory Hospital from other sources, since October 1890. From this it will be seen that out of a total of 85 cases, 84 or 98.8 per cent. occurred during the months of September, October, November and December The remaining case, or 1.17 per cent., originated in May. Other sporadic cases, however, have come under our notice during the remaining months, but they only tend to emphasize the fact, that the disease is chiefly prevalent during the last four months of the year, and as a rule, after the end of January, few cases will be found until the last month of the rains. * Blauford.50 TABLE X.

Eating grass and sedgy vegetation grown on low-lying and marshy ground. It is not usual for the natives of India to make any provision in the form of hay or dried grass for the maintenance of their animals. The general custom is to cut grass from the jungles and wastes as it is required. This being the case it is generally impossible to be certain where it is obtained. Towards the end of the hot weather grass on the higher lands has become burnt up, and it is then impossible in most instances to obtain a sufficient quantity ; at lower levels, however, especially at the bottoms of nullahs, swamps, ponds, &c, where water has been lying till a much later period, an abundant supply can generally be found, and it is from these sources that the grass-cutters procure it. The con- ditions under which the water in these swamps, ponds, &c, gradually evaporates, containing, as they do, large quantities of organic matter, and becoming almost putrid before finally disappearing, are those favourable for the development of Infusoria, and it is most probable that in such situations the " Trypanosoma Evansi" or its resting form finds a suitable habitat. The grass and herbage springing up through this semiputrid water must necessarily bear on its surface numerous forms of organic life, and amongst them doubtless that of the Surra Infusorian. Similar conditions operate during the wet season or immediately following it, especially in those parts of India where the temperature is high immediately after the rains cease. The lands bordering on rivers and streams, or those which are low-lying become flooded, the herbage is covered with water, which in some cases, when the land possesses a clayey subsoil, disappears almost entirely by gradual evaporation, and such places are favourable for the development of low forms of animal life, and possibly for the Surra organism. Animals, there- fore, which daily consume grass from such localities, run a risk of taking into their systems the contagium of this disease. 5. Drinking water from stagnant pools and wells, particularly at certain times of the year. It is a well established fact that numerous Entozoa, &c., gain an entrance into the system of persons drinking impure water, such for instance as the distoma hepaticum, the eggs of which are developed in water, or the ascris lumbricoides, as in Burmah in 1883, when at Moulmein an epidemic form of the disease was assumed during the wet season, by contamination of the shallow wells by surface drainage. The Dochmius duodenalis, according to Griesinger* produced in Egypt in 1854 anaemia, liver disease, and dysentery, when introduced by impure water. The oxyuris vermicularis, probably taken through water (Aitkin)51 It is therefore an easy matter to imagine that Infusoria, which are the natural inhabitants of all streams and tanks, can, and must be taken in by man and beast. As the hot season advances in India, these and other forms of life become densely packed in all stagnant pools and wells, owing to the rapid evaporation and the constant withdrawal of water therefrom, but they neverthe- less scarcely ever cease to increase and multiply. Consequently animals watered at such spots take in repeated doses of the organisms. In support of the question of well water being one of the most important factors in the production of Surra in horses, the following notes on cases Nos. I, II, III, and LXV, are quoted :52 swollen. On June 14th, A was shot, and buried eight feet beneath the surface of the ground. Up to the 15bh June 1892, horses C and D have shown no signs of illness ; also the four or five Sowars' horses, which accompanied the shikár expe- dition to Dharampore between the 26th of April and May 17th, and which were exposed to exactly the same influences of season and climate as A, B, and 0, have remained in good health. This points to the fact, that the disease was con- tracted from the water of the Pali Hill wells between March 17th and April 14th, but unfortunately owing to the fact of heavy rains having fallen, and the wells becoming full, the hæmatozoon could not be found to definitely prove that this was the case, as the previously concentrated water had become so very highly diluted. There can bo no doubt that A's illness commenced on April 15th, and that the first symptom noticed in B's case was the eruption of the skin. The question of the skin eruption as a primary symptom in some cases is dealt with specially elsewhere. The evidence brought forward in the above mentioned oases, as regards the well water being the vehicle of the contagium, which entered the system and produced the disease, is almost conclusive, 6. Overcrowding.53 (a) Of the mouth :54 Previous observers have pointed out, that if "Surra" is contagious, it is not so in the ordinary sense of the word. Evans* found no evidence to show that the disease is either contagious or infectious in the ordinary sense." Steele 55 From the foregoing evidence it would appear that Surra is not com- municable by the sick to healthy animals, except under certain conditions hereafter mentioned. From our present knowledge we should say, that the 'materies morbi' of the disease appears to be governed by the following laws :56 (b) Post mortem. (i) The number of hours that were allowed to elapse between death and the inoculation. (ii) The number of hæmatozoa in the blood just previous to death. V.57 In Horses. Thus horse A drank polluted water between the 17th March and April 14th, 1892. First symptom April 15th 1892. Latent period some time within a period of twenty-nine days. Horse B. (No. LXV) drank polluted water between the 17th March and April 14th, 1892. First symptom, urticarial eruption, May 23rd, 1892. Latent period some time within a period sixty-seven days, but certainly not less than thirty-nine. (II) The latent period, when the contagium is given by the mouth :58 No. XXIII suffering from Surra, but from which the hæmatozoon was absent. were given in a gallon of water. From this date to the 28th June no change was noticed. On the latter date two hundred minims (13.3 c.c.) of blood containing very numerous hæmatozoa were administered in a bucket-full of water. From this date (June 28th) up to September 1st, absolutely no symptom of disease was noticed ; but from the 1st until the 6th of September there was a very slight disturbance of temperature, which however remained normal. On the morning of the 11th September the temperature had risen to 39.4°C. and numerous hæmatozoa were observed in the blood.. Thus it. will be seen, that from the first exhibition to the animal of the soiled Surra blood on May 4th, 1891, until the last on the 28th June, a period of fifty- five days had elapsed ; and from the exhibition of the last two hundred minims, until the first appearance of the hæmatozoon in the blood, seventy-five days, or from first to last one hundred and thirty days. (III) The latent period when the fluid used for inoculation is drawn ante or post mortem from the animal affected with Surra. Ante Mortem. I.59 Post Mortem. I60 Horse No. XLI inoculated with 1.0c.c. of blood taken nine and a half hours post mortem from case No. XL, from which the hæmatozoon was absent, but very numerous ante mortem. Latent period seven days. 61 Post Mortem. I.62 (h.)63 elevated temperature has fallen, and in some oases has attained normal or even sub-normal limits. The visible mucous membranes are clean, and the conjunctival petechias begin to fade; the pulse, however, will be found to be weak and thready in character, but the appetite excellent, and in fact if it were not for the loss of flesh and slight oedema of the extremities, there would be little to show that the animal was ailing. But unfortunately this con- dition does not continue for any length of time, for again the temperature is elevated ; in the course of a few hours the thermometer registers a still higher degree, the animal is dull and dejected, and by the following day the visible mucous membranes present a yellow tinge; large ecchymoses dark in colour appear on the conjunctival membranes ; the action of the heart is irrit- able, the pulse full and quick, or at times intermittent, and regurgitation may be observed in the jugulars; the breathing is quickened, and the individual respirations shallow ; on watching an animal in this condition, it may be noticed that it takes seven to eight very short inspirations, and these are followed by a much more prolonged and sonorous one ; at the same time the breathing is more abdominal, than thoracic in character. On examination of the extremities, it will be found that the swelling and oedema have increased considerably, and that on the under-surface of the abdomen, where it was previously con- fined to the sheath, it has now commenced to spread forward along the subcu- taneous tissue between the skin and the muscles. During the whole of this time the appetite will have varied little, and the evacuations will be only slightly, if at all, altered in character. In the blood a repetition of the previous events takes place, the hæmatozoa make their appearance, and run up to a maximum, and again suddenly or gradually disappear according to the length of the fever period. These periods alternating with and without fever may go on for a considerable time ; the progress of the disease is variable, and greatly depends upon the condition of the animal attacked, the weak ones succumbing very rapidly ; but each bout of the fever brings with it as a rule an increase in the severity of the symptoms. There is augmented yellowness of the membranes, fresh crops of petechias on the conjunctival, a collection of gelatinous material at the inner canthi, which at times becomes red in colour from an admixture of blood, and which on microscopical examination is found to contain a varying number of the Surra hæmatozoa ; increased swelling and oedema of the extremities and abdomen, which now extends between the fore limbs and up the chest. During this time the wasting has been steadily progressive, especially the muscles- of the back and those surrounding the hip joint and the glutei. Towards the termination of the disease, it will be noticed that an animal is disinclined to move, and when made to do so, there will be manifest loss of power over the hind quarters, somewhat similating a slight partial paralysis, and the hind quarters of the animal reel from side to side. In connection with this it may be noted, that there is frequently present paralysis of the sphincter ani, and a dilated condition of the anus. These symptoms taken together, point to some interference with the normal functions of the spinal cord in the lower dorsal and lumbar regions, and is probably due to pressure caused by an exudation within the spinal membranes. In many cases shortly before death the heart's action becomes exceedingly violent, shaking the whole frame at each beat, so that the sound can be heard at some distance from the animal. In some of these cases the animal may suddenly drop dead. In others, the emacia- tion and weakness become so pronounced that the animal falls to the ground, and after a short bout of struggling, succumbs to the disease. In other cases, again, the animal falls to the ground and appears to be suffering from acute pain, struggles violently, sweats bedew the body, and the respirations are very hurried. The struggles soon exhaust the patient's strength, and for a time it lies quiet ; soon however the struggles commence again, and this continues until death occurs. B.64 tion. These conditions continue to increase, until by the fourth day, the tumour may measure three or four inches in one direction, by two or three in the other, and raised to the extent of an inch or inch and a half above the surround- ing tissues, or in some cases present an almost circular form throughout, It will be also found that if the tumour be firmly grasped, it is not fixed, but can be lifted up from the subcutaneous tissue. According to the nature and amount of the inoculated blood, so will these symptoms rapidly present themselves, and either attain a maximum or be retarded, until, varying from the fourth to the thirteenth day, the tumour at the seat of inoculation will be found to have lost a certain amount of its tension and tenderness. From this date the swelling and oedema will gradully begin to grow less, until finally after a period of ten to fourteen days, the only sign left of the former swelling will be a slight thickening of the skin over the point of injection. But at the moment when the tension and tenderness of the parts at the seat of inoculation become suddenly decreased, a symptom, of the utmost importance clinically, takes place, viz., at that moment, the organism of Surra enters the blood of the general circulation. The temperature on the day of inoculation, and in fact for several days afterwards, may remain normal in character, there being only a few points differ- ence between the morning and evening observations. In other cases there may be a slight rise from the first evening, and a gradual progressive rise until the swelling at the seat of inoculation shows signs of reduction in size, when the temperature generally takes a decided rise again, and may attain 40°C. or 41°C. This elevation will last a varying period of from two to six days, and on the day following its onset, the ordinary symptoms of fever will be noticed ; and in addi- tion there will be petechiæ on the conjunctival membranes, lachrymation, a slight mucous discharge from the nose, and in severe cases some oedema of the lower portion of the extremities, and perhaps of the sheath in horses. At the termination of the period of fever, the temperature will be found to have fallen to normal, or nearly so ; the animal will present a brighter aspect, and there is every appearance of its return to health ; but in a few days the animal again appears dull and semi-somnolent; the temperature becomes elevated, and a relapse takes place, and a repetition of all the symptoms in the primary paroxysm including the re-appearance of the hæmatozoon, is observed.

A point of great interest, and a symptom of the greatest clinical value occurs at the time of the organism leaving the seat of the swelling68 39.2°C. to 41.2°C. which it maintains for a brief period ; it then falls quickly or gradually, to a normal or a subnormal minimum, either at the same time, or just previous to the first appearance of the hæmatozoon in the gluteal circulation.

69 of Horses Nos. 472 and 356, as examples of a point brought out by Steele, that "the tracing from the number of pulse beats resembles that from thermometer readings." In nearly every case of Surra, at one period or another, and usually during one of fever, the pulse presents unmistakeable signs of irregularity or intermission. I have noticed from one complete intermission in twelve beats, down to as many as one in four, but in most instances a few hours later, or on the following day, no trace of irregularity existed. During a period of fever the pulse may vary considerably in frequency, according to the elevation of the temperature, with or without intermissions ; the blood vessel during this time feels round, and dilated with a moderate tension, the access of the pulsation is sudden, and of short duration, and its subsidence abrupt, but is fairly easy of compression between the beats, the walls of the vessel feeling smooth and elas- tic. But a marked change appears during an apyrexial period, the frequency is diminished or normal ; in many instances there is some irregularity, or the pulse intermits, the beat is weak and thready, the access being gradual, its duration long, and the subsidence slow, and the vessel feels flat, or at the most only half distended with blood. When the disease has been running on for a variable period, there comes a time, only a few days before death, when continued fever usually accompanied by daily remissions takes the place of the former type. During this period the pulse is increased in frequency, 65 to 72 beats per minute, regular, but bounding, forcible and large, reminding one of the force of the pulse of aortic regurgita- tions, but in Surra the impulse is not visible in the carotids, or in the superficial arteries. At the time of death the frequency of the pulse is greatly increased, and may attain 120 or more beats per minute. 2. Action of the heart.70 pairs on the tip of the tongue, and sometimes a degeneration of the epithelium, which at a later date separates from the deeper part of the membrane, leaving superficial circumscribed ulcers. (ii). The appetite usually ceases with the supervention of fever in the horse, but this disease is an extraordinary exception to the rule. In most cases from the very outset of the disease until death, which may occur weeks or even months later, the animal may never cease to eat all the food placed before it, and in numerous cases under my own observation, the bedding has been devoured during the hours of the night, the temperature at the time being 41.2°C.(106.1°F.) or even as high as 42°C.(107.6°F.). Evans remarks " some cases at last drop down and die suddenly, perhaps when they are eating and enjoying food * * * while other cases linger for days after they are down, too weak to rise or to stand after they are helped up, but go on eating all the grass they get, and much of the corn until they die." " The appetite is excessive throughout the attack ; it is remarkable how the animal in a state of semi-coma will continue to eat grass almost without ceasing * * * Some patients stand and feed to the very last, and then drop dead." (Steele). The following extract from the Report of the London Fever Hospital for 1843, has reference to Relapsing Fever of that year :71 e.72 f.73 cavities. On examination a congested and arborescent condition of the vessels is found, particularly well-marked on the upper part of the nasal septum.

It first involved the fetlocks more especially of the hind limbs, and gradually extended upwards towards the hocks, the most noticeable features being the absence of heat and tenderness on pressure.

II, LVI), whilst, no less than nine inoculated animals (Nos. XIV, XV, VI, XXI, XXIV, LIX, LIV XX) also showed them. The Mesenteric glands.83 the branching and peculiarities of the vessel, which they occupied. The lining membrane of the right auricle and ventricle, and much less frequently the cavi- ties on the left side, are observed to be stained a dusky red or claret colour; but the pathological change, which gauges the gravity of the disease in each indivi- dual case, must be looked for and estimated by the number and extent of the sub-endocardial extravasations. These in cases under treatment, when the hæmatozoon has been absent for some ten days, have been found to be entirely absent; in other cases they may be represented by a few petechiæ, and again in more severe attacks, extensive extravasations of blood may be present. These sub-endocardial changes are usually more frequently present in the right ven- tricle than in the left, and have been noticed in the cavities on the right side of the heart, when they have been entirely absent from the left. They are least frequently found In the left auricle. A common situation for them to occupy is the surface of the musculi papillares, but they may appear on any portion of the muscular wall of the cavity, as well as frequently involving the inner surface of the flaps of the tricuspid and mitral valves. The ventricles occasionally pre- sent well marked signs of fatty degeneration, and although in the human being, the left is the more frequently affected, in these cases the right ventricle has been observed to present the most marked changes, near to the apex of the organ. In cases where the visible mucous membranes have been stained yellow during life, the same colouration of the tissues of the internal surface of the heart has been found well marked. In all the cases the yellow deposit of gela- tinous material was present round the base of the organ. Naturally contracted.84 pleuropneumonia of cattle. In a large majority of horses examined post mortem, the lungs presented calcareous bodies rather superficially situated, or in the depths of the tissues, exactly similar to those found in the liver. These, as in the former case, are due to some cestode, and the changes are of ancient date, considerably before the contraction or inoculation of Surra.

EXPERIMENTAL ENQUIRY INTO THE TREATMENT OF SURRA. Few observers have tried any systematic treatment with regard to ' Surra' cases, and those few who have, unfortunately have only had negative results to record. Evans tried Carbolic Acid in Glycerine (1 in 4) in large doses in four cases, but all succumbed. The late Veterinary Surgeon Steele informed me, that he had made a series of experiments with different drugs, especially mentioning Mer- curic perchloride, but that all his cases in like manner proved fatal. Pottinger experimented with large doses of Sodii. Hyposulphis. and Potass. Nitras. given in drinking water. He also tried Arsenic, Aconite, and Quinin105 the reproduction of Anthrax and other spores; while, 1: 7168 prevented the development of spores in unboiled meat infusion. As the ' materies morbi' of Surra is an infusorian, consisting of differentiated protoplasm, it was hoped that the action of this chemical substance on subcutaneous injection, would at first act upon the hæmatozoa, and that by a more prolonged exhibition of the drug, the resting form might be attacked, and eventually overcome. Case No. VI was the first in which Mercuric Perchloride was tried. The disease was produced artificially by the subcutaneous inoculation of a small quantity of soiled blood. During a period of six days the animal received 2.6 grammes (39 grains) of Mercuric Perchloride, (one cubic centimetre of the inject- ed fluid containing one decigramme of the chemical), without its having produced any apparent effect upon the hæmatozoon. In the course of a few hours after its administration, a raised swelling appeared at the seat of each injection, formed by the exudation into the subcutaneous tissues of a jelly-like material. In the further treatment of this case, Iodine and Iodide of Potassium were substituted for the foregoing drug. In a second case, No. VIII, after the previous experience of the subcuta- neous action of Mercuric Perchloride, it was decided to directly inject the solution containing a large dose of the chemical, into the general circulation, in order if possible to overcome the hæmatozoon at once, and thus to allow the effect of the mercury lasting for a considerable period. For this purpose, 0.6 gramme was mixed with Glycerine and water, and injected into the Jugular Vein. Although very serious symptoms of poisoning were produced by pushing the administra- tion, of the drug thus far, hourly microscopical examination of the blood for the next seven hours failed to detect any diminution in the number or activity of the Trypanosoma, and they continued to be present in the blood for the next three days. Iodine and Iodide of Potassium. Iodine is known to be a powerful antiseptic and oxidising agent, and in addition Koch found that it possesses the power of correcting the movements of protoplasm. The spores of certain organisms were destroyed, and their germi- nation prevented after exposure for 2i hours to a solution of Iodine in water, of the strength of 1 in 7,000. For these reasons it was determined to try its effects upon the Surra hæmatozoon. Hyd.Perchlor. Case No. VI.106 began to rise at once, and by midday attained 89.2°C., and when recorded at 5 P.M., was found to register 39.8°C. On the morning of the 7th the temperature was 41°C., the animal had not lost in condition, and the oedema previously present appeared to have diminished during the treatment, as well as there being an improvement in the gait. The hæmatozoa were still numerous in the blood. The dose was again increased and 7 c.c. were given as before; by five P. M. the thermometer showed a fall of three quarters of a degree Centigrade, and during the night a somewhat sudden fall of 2.5°C. to 37.8°C. took place, and the hæmatozoon in the blood fell in numbers to few. There ap- peared, however, an eruption of urticaria general in character, but not particularly well marked. This was not deemed of sufficient importance to contra-indicate the administration of the drug, and consequently the animal again received a similar amount to that which was the day before injected. During the day and the following night the temperature remained low, and the eruption, which had commenced to fade the evening previously, had now entirely disappeared. On examination of the blood the organism was found to- be again present in large numbers, and as 2.6 grammes (39 grains) had been administered during a period of six days, without producing any apparent action on the hæmatozoon, it was deemed advisable to substitute this by some other form of treatment. It was therefore decided to make use of the following solution in the further treatment of the case : R. Iodum107 when applied in substance or strong solution, it produces no local irritation, but acts as a local anaesthetic. It also prevents the development of giant cells, and may thus prevent morbid tissue growth. Iodoform. Case No. VIII.108 numbers in the blood as found previous to the injection. The animal had quite returned to its normal condition. On the morning of the ninth day of the disease, the organism was absent from the blood, but 109 and sixteenth days, 165 grains (11.0 grammes) were given, the hæmatzoon being few in number in the blood, but on the seventeenth they again became numerous, and the temper- ature registered 38°C., the animal receiving on this occasion 160 grains (10.66 grammes). Cm the morning of the eighteenth day, the temperature was 40.loC. and the hæmatozoon was absent, but by 5 P.M. the thermometer registered 41.8°C. ; during the day the animal received Potass. Bichromate 190 grains (12.66 grammes). On the morning of the nineteenth day, the temperature had fallen to 39.5°C. and the organisms were absent from the blood. Again during the night the temperature fell and next morning registered only 37.8°C., but the hæmatozoon was again present. From the morning of the 20th until the evening of the 24th day of the disease, very large doses of the drug were administered, viz. an average of one hundred and fifty grains (10 grammes) twice a day, or 1,500 grains (100 grammes) in all. The drug was discontinued on account of the ejection by the animal of some blood-stained mucus on coughing, the first symptom observed during the exhibiting of the Bichromate, or of anything referable to its action. The appetite of the animal was good during the whole period of treatment, but as on the nineteenth day of the disease the animal refused to take any water to drink, the treatment was omitted for twenty-four hours. It will be noted that doses of five, seven and a half, and eleven grains injected into the general circulation failed to produce any appreciable symptoms, with the exception of a localized oedema at the seat of inoculation. Further it is a point of great clinical im- portance, that after a course of large doses of the drug, which attained a maximum of 360 grains (24.0 grammes) in the twenty-four hours, and amounted to nineteen hundred grains (126.6 grammes.) in all, the animal should have maintained fairly good health, and the hæmatozoon should have still continued to be numerous in the blood. Mixed Cinchona Alkaloids.110 epithelial casts, and a small number of blood corpuscles in the urine. The large doses of Arsenic and Alkaloids have been persisted in, notwithstanding the intestinal and hepatic derangements, as it was feared that the high temperature indicated the probable return of the Surra hæmatozoon. On the 9th there were symptoms of gastro intestinal catarrh, and taking these complications into consideration, as well as the fact that the hæmatozoa had been absent from the blood for a period of twenty days, it was decided to discontinue the Arsenic and Alkaloids entirely, and a laxative and simple febrifuge was substituted. From the 10th to the 14th all went well, and the animal seemed to improve, the temperature re- mained low, and the animal became much brighter and fed well. On the 15th, however, he was dull and the respiration and pulse had increased in frequency, the visible mucous membranes becoming of a dirty-yellow colour and petechiated. On the 16th although his appearance was brighter, the respirations had risen very high, and the heart's action was irritable; the symptoms of gastro-intestinal catarrh and the kidney disorder had entirely disappeared. On the 17th the animal appeared in much the same condition, but the respira- tions were less although the temperature was a little higher. On this date one "Surra" hæmatozoon was discovered in two cover-glass specimens of blood, and this was the first organism observed during a period of twenty-eight days. The previous treatment of Arsenic and Cinchona Alkaloids was at once resumed. On the 18th the animal had not altered much in appearance, the respirations were greatly improved in character and the pulse in frequency, but the temperature had risen. The blood contained a few hæmatozoa, but not so active in their movements as the one noticed the day before. On the 19th the condition was worse, the hæmatozoa very numerous in the blood and the temperature much elevated, viz., 41°C. On the 20th the appetite was normal, but otherwise the animal did not manifest any im- provement ; only two hæmatozoa were observed in two cover-glass specimens of the blood, and these were exceedingly torpid. On the 21st the hæmatozoa were entirely absent, and from this date the animal appeared to be unable to throw off the effect which the return of the hæmatozoon had given rise to, and he gradually became weaker, and died on the 29th of July, although the hæmatozoa were absent during the last nine days. Acidum Carbolicum.111 administered daring the day. From the 29th the general condition of the animal was un- changed, and. there were few active hæmatozoa in the blood. The amount of the medicine was therefore again increased, the animal receiving Carbolic Acid drachms xxiv, and Iodine drachms viii. On the 30th no effect appeared to have been produced on the health of the animal by the drug, the appetite and general appearance being as before. The only effect noticed being in connection with the urine, which assumed a brownish-black colour, and exhibited an inky line on the. addition of a small quantity of Nitric Acid. On microscopical examination of the blood, the organisms were found to be numerous. The animal received during this day Carbolic Acid drachms xv, and Iodine drachms viijs. On October 1st the animal showed the first symptoms which might be referred to the action of the drugs, appearing slightly uneasy after taking food. On microscopical examination of the blood, no hæmatozoa were detected. Taking into consideration the symptoms evinced by the animal, it was decided to discontinue the administration of the medicine, as it was deemed to have had a fair trial in this case, when it is considered that the administration of pure Carbolic Acid seventy-six drachms, and Iodine thirty-four and a half drachms, produced so little effect on the organisms. It is apparently evident, that their use as remedial agents in this disease is of little practical value. From October 1st to the 4th no organisms were detected in the blood, the uneasiness passed off, and no further effect of the medicine was noticeable. On the morning of the 4th October a few hæmatozoa were discovered in the blood, and it was consequently decided to again adopt treatment with Cinchona Alkaloids and Arsenic. Accordingly Cinchona Alkaloids one and a half Cinchona Alkaloids and Arsenic. drachms, and Arsenic grs. iv were given twice during the day, and these doses were continued until the evening of the 6th, when they were increased to two drachms and five grains respectively, and these doses were continued until the even- ing of the 10th, when they were again increased to two and a half drachms, and six grains respectively, and continued until the evening of the 14th, when they were increased to three drachms, and seven grains, and on the evening of the 16th the Arsenic was increased to eight grains. The disease continued to steadily progress during this time, and very little effect was produced upon the temperature. Case No. LXXL112 be in perfect health, and in splendid condition." On this day the hæmatozoon was absent from the blood, while for the next two days it was swarming ; specific treatment was deferred, a simple febrifuge draught being given to try and reduce the temperature. On the evening of 12th October the organism was only present in small numbers in the blood, and the temperature had decreased considerably; as had also the pulse. It was decided to again attempt the destruction of the hæmatozoon by the exhibition of Cinchona Alkaloids and Arsenic, commencing in this instance with large doses (viz. Alkaloid drs. iij and Arsenic grains iv bis die). The reason why large doses of the former were exhibited was that few hæmatozoa remained in the blood, and in order to decide whether their destruction could be compassed by the drug, the dose was so regulated as to insure its having a fair trial. No marked change took place in the animal's condition, nor in the number of the organisms present, until the 16th instant, when the hæmatozoa became numerous, the temperature rose considerably, respirations were increased in number, and it was noticed that the sheath was swollen ; the treatment was continued, the dose of Arsenic having been gradually raised to six grains. On the 17th the organism had again fallen to few, but the temperature and pulse were still above normal. On this date it was decided to try the effect of full doses of Quinine, as this drug has been said to be of much value when exhibited in this manner. Ranking has stated that " by the employment of full doses of Quinine and Arsenic, he has been able to cure the disease. It appeared from our previous experiments on the use of similar drugs, that it would be futile to attempt the destruction of the hæmatozoon by giving only the full medicinal dose, and we considered it to be advisable therefore to commence with a dose of drs. iv of Quinine, and Arsenic grains xii in the 24 hours, carefully watching its effects, and in case of any untoward symptom appearing, to discontinue its use. At noon on this date therefore drs. iv of Quinine were given, and the horse carefully watched during the day. With the exception of slight dulness no marked symptom followed its use. On the 18th some improvement had taken place, the hæmatozoon was absent from the blood, the temperature had fallen somewhat, as had also the respirations and pulse ; five drachms of Quinine alone were given on that day, and no marked symptoms were produced with the exception of an increase in the number of the respirations, which soon passed off. On the 19th contrary to our expectation the hæmatozoon again appeared in the blood in small numbers, but there was no very marked change in the animal's condition. Quinæ Sulph. increased to drs. vi caused no marked disturbance. On the 20th the animal was bright, but the disease was progressing as witnessed by oedema appearing under the abdomen ; the same quantity of Quinine and Arsenic were administered as on the 19th. On the 21st petechiæ had appeared on the conjunctival membranes, but otherwise there was little change ; medicine continued as before. On the 22nd no change was noticed ; the medicine was again repeated. On the following day the animal presented a dull appearance, but not markedly so. Quinine and Arsenic in large doses have apparently produced no amelioration of the animal's condition, nor the slightest effect upon the vitality of the hæmatozoon, which is as active and numerous as before, and it was hence resolved to abandon the experiment, and to return to the use of Cinchona Alkaloids and Arsenic ; six drachms of the Alkaloids and twelve grains of Arsenic were given. On the 24th the hæmatozoon had disappeared from the blood, but the disease was progressing ; on this day the Arsenic was increased to fourteen grains, On the 25th disease was still progressing, the animal being exceedingly dull, and the oedema increasing, From this date until the morning of the 30th, the medicine consisted of Alkaloids drs. vi, and Arsenic grains xvi per diem, and a gradual improvement in the patient's condition was noted, the oedema on the under-surface of the belly decreasing in amount, and the animal pre- senting a bright appearance, while the temperature kept slightly above the normal range. On the morning of the 30th the animal was very dull, and the visible mucous membranes were injected, but the oedema was reduced in amount, From the evening of this date the dose of Arsenic was decreased to ten grains during the day. On the morning of the 31st the tempe- rature and the pulse were normal, and remained so throughout the day, but there was no further change. From this date until November 7th, the medicine was given twice daily in the same doses, and improvement in the animal's condition was progressive, so much so that on the 5th and subsequent days the animal appeared to be in perfect health, and it would have been impossible for any one to discover that he was the subject of " Surra". On the morning of the 7th, however, the patient was noticed to be dull, and the temperature at midday was slightly above normal ; so the treatment was continued. On the 8th the only change noticed in the morning was the appearance of two petechiæ on the membrana nictitans; the temperature still remaining slightly above normal, and the respirations increased in number. On the 9th animal was dull, the temperature rose steadily throughout the day to 40.3°C, but beyond this there was no apparent change ; on the evening of this day the dose of Cinchona Alka- loids was reduced to two and a half drachms, and that of the Arsenic increased to six grains. On the 10th there was little change excepting that the temperature had fallen to 39.3°C. and the respirations to normal ; the medicine was continued. On the 11th the condition remained absolutely unchanged. On l-2th there was slight improvement, the animal being brighter; treatment discontinued in the evening. On the 13th the animal was somewhat dull, the temperature at midday fell to normal, and only rose slightly in the evening. Medi- cine was omitted in the morning, and Cinchona Alkaloids two drachms, and Arsenic four grains were given in the evening. On the 14th serious symptoms were noticed, the animal.
113 appearing almost somnolent, head hanging, eyes dull and heavy, and the attitude indicative of extreme depression, and 114 Case No. LXXIV.115 try the effect of Liq. Potassæ in large doses on the hæmatozoon, and as the temperature rose the same evening to 40°C., a dose of 3iv was administered. On the morning of the 27th the temperature was 39.1°C., P. 76, R. 20, and the hæmatozoon absent from the blood, but by evening the temperature had again risen to 39.7°C., P. 80, R. 34 ; nine drachms of Liq. Potassæ were given during the twenty-four hours. By the 28th, temperature, pulse and respirations had all fallen considerably, but the organism had again made its appearance in the blood. The urine was found to contain in addition to albumen 1/22nd, and casts, a trace of bile and bile acids. At five P.M. the Temp. was 40.2°C., P. 72, R. 24. Three doses of medicine were administered during the day. On the morning of the 29th, the animal presented a dull appearance, and there was a slight mucous discharge from the nostrils ; the temperature had fallen a degree during the night, but the pulse was dicrotic, and registered the same as on the previous evening, and the hæmatozoa were few in the blood. Three doses of the medicine were repeated. On the 30th, the animal again presented a dull appearance ; the visible mucous membranes were clean, but the conjunctivas peteohiated; there was also considerable oedema of the extremities especially of the hind limbs, and the sheath presented the same condition, but to a more limited extent. Temp. A.M. 39.3°C., P. 72, R. 20. Hæmatozoa few in the blood. Three doses of medicine were repeated. December 1st.116 the morning of the second day registered 36.5°C, the animal presented a brighter appear- ance, and some further absorption of the exudation on the under-surface of the abdomen had taken place, although that of the limbs continued unabated. During the period which elapsed between the 11th of December 1892, and the 4th of January 1893, the Arsenical treatment was continued ; the Surra hæmatozoon was absent from the blood. The maximum dose of grains vii, was again exhibited on the 14th and 15th December, but from the latter date it was gradually reduced by one grain at a time, until the minimum of grains iii, was reached on the 3rd January. On the 16th December, the animal commenced to lose flesh rapidly, although previous to that date it had become to a certain extent emaciated within the limits of health. Prom this date, however, in spite of the amount of food consumed, progressive atrophy of the muscles set in, especially along either side of the spinal column and those surrounding the hip-joints and buttocks.

R. 8. 3rd118 following morning, the 8th, the temperature had fallen over two degrees Centigrade, the organisms were leas numerous in the blood, but the pulse and respirations were only slightly reduced in frequency, and the amount of albumen remained stationary in the urine. The same evening the temperature again became elevated 40.5°C., P. 72, R. 33. Two doses of the medicine were administered. On the morning of the 9th the thermometer registered 39.6°C. in the rectum, P. 60, and the respirations had become reduced to 16 in the minute. The bæmatozoa had also become greatly reduced in numbers, and were now few in the blood, but again the albumen was present in the urine in such quantity, that on boiling, &c. the fluid became almost solid. By midday the temperature had again risen, and registered 40.6°C., and by 5 P.M. was 41.3°C.,P. 72, R. 20. In the morning the dose had been increased to Arsenic grains v. and in the evening was again increased by one grain. Early on the morning of the 10 th, the temperature was found to have fallen to 37°C, 4.3°C., (7.7°F.) during the night. The pulse now registered 44, and the respirations 12, and the hæmatozoon was found to be absent from the blood. At the same time the albumen in the urine was found to have been reduced to ¼. It will thus be seen that from the first exhibition of the drug to the animal, until the disappearance of the hæmatozoon from the general circulation, five doses of the drug had been given, with a total of twenty-three grains. But it must not be forgotten that in the natural course of events, the paroxysm would, in all probability, have lasted only five or six days if untreated; therefore all that we may claim to have accomplished is, to have shortened the period during which the organism was present in the blood.: But from this date until the 22nd December, when death took place, a period of thirteen days, the hæmato- zoon remained absent from the blood. In an untreated case, after an intermission lasting from one to three days, a second paroxysm usually occurs, and on reference to the records of temperature, it will be seen, that on the day a return of the organism to the blood would most likely occur, the morning record was 38.2°C. ; but by the evening it had attained a maximum of 40.3°C., P. 64, R. 16. On the following morning it had again fallen two degrees C, but no sign of the hæmatozoon was found on microscopical examination of the blood, on this or on any subsequent occasion. To what extent the treatment operated in prolonging the life of the animal, it is impos- sible to say ; but it would appear probable that (i) by bringing, down the temperature for some days to within normal limits, (ii) by removing the irritation from the general circulation and so from the nervous system, and lastly (iii) by reducing considerably the amount of albumen excreted to 1/9th, on the 17th December, a beneficial effect was produced,and by this means the fatal termination was delayed for a short period. Arsenic. Case No.119 the membranæ nictitantes, and there was a slight watery discharge from the nostrils accom panied by cough, and a small swelling was discovered, painful on pressure, over the left orbit. By midday on the 19th, the temperature was 39.7°C., but during the following night fell to 37.3°C., the swelling over the left eye had increased in size. Three doses of Arsenic making or. xiv in all were given on the latter date, but notwithstanding the temperature continued to rise until 5 P.M., when it registered 39.8°C., and attained a maximum of 40.1oC. at midday on the 21st, on which day the Arsenic was increased to gr. vss. per dose. The abscess burst in the night, and early on the morning of the 22nd a further quantity of pus was evacuated, and the temperature fell to 38.1°C., but the respirations increased to 20 per minute, the pulse being 64. On the 24th, the animal presented a dull appearance, the ordinary symp- toms of the disease were present, and in addition there was swelling and 120 42nd day. Notwithstanding that the animal's appetite continued to be very good, and that the condition was fairly maintained, it was decided to abandon the. treatment for the fol- lowing reasons:121 No. XVII122 TABLE XVII-continued.

In this first volume of the Surra Report, it is impossible to discuss satis- factorily the whole subject of the disease, owing to the large number of side issues affecting it, and to the fact, that in Volume II the Idiopathic disease as it occurs in rats, dogs, and other animals than horses, has to be treated and dis- cussed, as well as the presence of the Infusorian in certain kinds of fish. The localities, in which the disease occurs, are found generally within a belt, bordered by the 18° and 24° of N. Latitude and are of two kinds : first, those in which the disease is known to be endemic, and second, those in which it has occurred either at intervals of some years, or on one known occasion only. The former are damp and low-lying, possessing a warm, humid and equable climate, exceedingly favourable for the development of Infusorial life ; the latter are also low-lying, but have a climate almost exactly opposite to the other, viz.,. a dry atmosphere for many months of the year, a considerable variation of temperature, and a comparatively small rainfall. The rivers, however, in the latter localities are liable to inundate the surrounding district, and thus contaminate with the Infusorian the herbage employed for feeding purposes. The main point ascertained in this enquiry is, that the Infusorian of Surra can in the first place be made to disappear from the blood of affected animals, by subjecting the latter to a short course of treatment with Arsenic ; and, by a more prolonged administration of the chemical, it can be completely destroyed ; but the extent to which the Arsenic could be administered without injury to the animal is as yet unknown. It is therefore of importance to large horse-owners to consider whether certain preventive steps should not be adopted previous to, and during the period in which outbreaks are usually known to occur, instead of treating the disease on its appearance; and this may be considered under two distinct heads, viz. :HORSE SURRA LIST OF APPENDICES TO THE REPORT.

HORSE SURRA. NATURALLY CONTRACTED. CASES I,II,III. These three cases of Surra marked I, II and III were considerably advanced before they came under observation. The horses were the property of a gentleman, living out at Pali Hill, Bándra, near Bombay, and had all been submitted to the same conditions as regards climate, locality, water and fodder, and although the cases occurred in 1890, Case No. LXV, dated June 1892, may be read at the same time with advantage in connection with them, as the two stables, in which the cases occurred, are only a few hundred yards apart. The water, which is supposed to have been the vehicle by which the contagium was carried in the two outbreaks, was obtained from wells of the same description, the water in which had become low and turbid during the hot weather. This being the case, the notes, which accompany Case LXV, are applicable to the above three. The owner of these horses was conversant with the fact that by supplying his animals with grass grown on low marshy ground he was running a considerable risk of introducing Surra amongst them, and he had, therefore, for sometime previous to this outbreak, taken the precaution of obtaining all the requisite grass from as near the highest point of the surrounding hills as possible. Taking all this into consideration, it appears to be extremely probable that the well-water was the means by which the disease was introduced.

On the evening of June 11th horse B was sent up to the Laboratory for treatment and arrived on the morning of June 12th, 1392. June 12thxiii 20th.xiv 27th.XV Temp. 5 P.M. 39.5°C. P. 52.

On questioning the Syce he says the cough only comes on a few minutes after the above trivial operation. On taking a drop of blood this afternoon, the animal again coughed ; and as nothing was found on auscultation, &c, of the chest, the cough must be the result of reflex irritation.

On microscopical examination the urine presents a few granular casts, striated spheres, dumb-bell (2 forms) crystals of Carbonate of Calcium. Temp. 1 P.M. 40.5°C. xxi The body is in poor condition, bub not so much emaciated as horses generally are when they have succumbed to " Surra." There is no fluid in the pleural cavities, and there are no pleuritic adhesions. The lungs are of a reddish pink colour fully distended with air except at certain spots which are of a dark purple colour ; these are dotted over the apices of both organs, and on examination are found to be the seat of atelectasis. There are no extravasations of blood on the surface of the organs, or caseous nodules lying under the visceral pleura. On section the tissues present a reddish pink colour and appear to be well distended with air. The pericardium contains about 60 c.c. of an orange-coloured fluid, and there are no adhesions. The heart weighs 5 lbs. 15 ozs. after removal of the contained blood and clots. Externally there is nothing pathological to notice. The right auricle contains a small quantity of black semi-fluid blood ; there are no sub-endocardial petechia3. The right ven- tricle contains dark semi-fluid blood and some clots, but no petechiæ ; valves normal. The left auricle contains a small quantity of dark fluid blood ; no petechias. The left ventricle is almost empty, contracted, no petechias ; mitral and aortic valves healthy. The stomach is partially distended with semi-digested food. On section, the cuticular portion is healthy ; the mucous membrane of the villous portion is pale, with the exception of a small patch irregular in outline about two inches in diameter, which lies midway between the cuticular boundary and the pylorus, which presents a very pale pink colour and which is due to slight congestion. There is, however, neither ulceration nor thickening of the mu- cous coat. The small intestine externally appears normal. On section the walls are found coated with mucus and there are several (5) localized patches, made up of small round red coloured spots, each spot being about 1/6th inch in diameter and the patches 1 inch to 1½ in diameter. These are widely separated and there is no solution of continuity of the mucous membrane. No parasites of any kind were observed although their presence was carefully searched for. Cxxii worked hard in the sun between April 26th and May 17th, and during the whole of this period A was unwell, stumbling in action, feverish and losing condition ; she was therefore not worked so hard as the others. On May 17th they were returned to Pali Hill ; A was then feverish and unwell; she was driven a short distance and on her return appeared to be very bad and refused food ; she received some febrifuge medicine. On the 23rd of May B refused his food and an eruption broke out over the whole body accompanied by fever, which continued until the 30th of the month. Between the 4th and 8th of June A and B showed symptoms of " Surra" and on the 9th the Surra hæmatozoon was detected in B's blood, but that of A was free. A's condition continued to get worse and on June 14th she was shot and buried. None of the other horses C, D or the sowárs' animals have shown any symptoms of illness ; this points to the fact that the disease was contracted from the water of the Pali Hill wells between March 17th and April 14th. But unfortunately, owing to the fact of heavy rains having fallen and the wells becoming full, I was unable to find the hæmatozoon and so definitely prove that this was the case, as the previously concentrated water had become so very highly diluted. There can be no doubt that A's illness commenced on April 15th and that the first symptom noticed in B's case was the eruption of the skin. The question of the skin-eruption as a primary symptom in some cases is dealt with specially elsewhere. B was sent to the Laboratory on June 12th and it was decided to attempt curative treat- ment, although it was recognized that the animal had already been suffering from the disease for a period of at least twenty-three days. It was thought advisable to commence the treatment when the number of ha3matozoa in the blood should be on the decline and accordingly on the 14th June the ha3matozoa being few, treatment with Cinchona Alkaloids and Arsenic in large doses was commenced. On the 20bh the hæmatozoa disappeared from the blood, but the temperature and respirations remained above normal. The general symptoms of Surra increased up to the 24th, [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page]

xxix No hæmatozoa were discovered in the blood on microscopical examination, but we were unable to decide whether this absence was the result of the treatment, or whether it was one of the natural phases of the disease. It was, therefore, resolved to continue the medi- cine, and the horse received, during the day, Carbolic Acid 3vi and Iodine 3iii. On the morning of the 28th, the animal looked bright and well, the number of respira- tions had decreased considerably, but a microscopical examination of the blood revealed the presence of a few hæmatozoa. The amount of Carbolic Acid and Iodine was, therefore, increased, twelve of the former and sis and a half drachms of the latter were administered during the day. From the 29th, the general condition of the animal was unchanged and there were few and active hæmatozoa in the blood. The amount of the medicine was, therefore, again increased, the animal receiving Carbolic Acid 3xxiv and Iodine 3viii. On the 30th, no effect appeared to have been produced on the health of the animal by the drug, the appetite and general appearance being as before. The only effect noticed being in connection with the urine, which assumed a brownish-black colour, and exhibited an inky line on the addition of a small quantity of Nitric Acid to it. On microscopical examination of the blood, the organisms were found to be numerous. The animal received, during this day, Carbolic Acid 3xv and Iodine 3viiss. On October 1st, the animal showed the first symptoms which might be referred to the action of the drugs, appearing slightly uneasy after taking food. On microscopical examination of the blood, no hæmatozoa were detected. Taking into consideration the symptoms evinced by the animal, it was decided to discontinue the administration of the medicine, as it was deemed to have had a fair trial in the case; when it is considered that the administration of pure Carbolic Acid seventy-six. drachms and Iodine thirty-two drachms produced so little effect on the organisms, it will appear to be evident that their use as remedical agents in this disease is of little practical value. From October 1st to the 4th no organisms were detected in the blood, the uneasiness passed off, and no further effect of the medicine was noticeable. On the morning of the 4th October, a few hæmatozoa were discovered in the blood, and it was consequently decided to again adopt treatment with Cinchona Alkaloids and Arsenic. Accordingly Cinchona Alkaloids 3iss and Arsenic grs. iv were given twice during the day, and these doses were continued until the evening of the 6th, when they were increased to two drachms and five grains respectively, and these doses were continued until the evening of the 10th, when they were again increased to two and a half drachms and six grains respectively, and continued until the evening of the 14th, when they were increased to three drachms and seven grains, and on the evening of the 16th, the Arsenic was increased to eight grains. The disease continued to steadily progress during this time, and very little effect was produced upon the tempera- ture. The hæmatozoa during the period of the latter course of treatment were few for the first four days, then absent for two days, again being few for four days, numerous for one, again few for one day and then absent for four days from the blood, when death took place.

During this period of twenty-six days, the temperature gradually fell until it attained a maximum of 37.5°C. on the morning of the 3rd November and from that date it gradually rose, attaining a maximum of 40.3°C. on the evening of the 9th November, and again fell to 37°C. on the 14th November and from this date until 20th there were- morning remissions and evening exacerbations, until on. the latter date 41.5°C. was registered by the thermometer, the evening previous to death. The medicines were continued in varying doses so as to accommodate them to the condition presented by the animal until the evening of the 14th November with two exceptions, namely, on the evening of the 12th and morning of the 13th when they were omitted, during which period one hundred and seven drachms of Cinchona Alkaloids and two hundred and forty-one grains of Arsenic in the form of Liquor Arsenicalis were administered.

lxiii Double Iodide of Potassium and Mercury (Iodic-Hydrarg) could be commenced. On the morning of the 16th the, thermometer registered 39.2°C., and the organism was absent for the first time during a period of ten days. Four grains of the drug were administered, followed by a similar dose in the evening, which had the eftect of bringing down the tem- perature on the morning of the 17th, to 38°5C., with the organisms still absent. On the 19th, although Iodic-Hydrarg grains xxxviii had been given, the hæmatozoon had re-appeared in the blood. The thermometer registered 39.2°C, and 39.8°C. by 5 P.M. This treatment was continued until the 21st with unsatisfactory results, as the temperature was 40.3°C. and the organisms numerous in the blood, So after giving another dose of Quinæ Sulph. 3iij an Arsenical treatment was substituted for the Iodic-Hydrarg. On the morning of the 22nd, after the administration to the animal of Arsenic grains x, the organism disappeared from the blood, and on the 25th the temperature fell as low as 36.5°0. But on the 27th, the date of a recurrence in the ordinary course of events, the hæmatozoon was again found in small numbers in the blood for one day. Thus only an abortive paroxysm took place, its further course being frustrated by the effect of the Arsenic. From this date until the morning of the 15th December, on which date death took place, a period of seventeen days, the hæmatozoon was absent from the blood. Unfortunately the presence of albumen in the urine from the very first day previous to the treatment being commenced followed at a later date by numerous blood and granular casts, was a very serious symptom and really contra-indicated the treatment adopted, in view of the serious kidney lesion betokened, but as the disease was rapidly progressive, it was necessary to adopt some form of treatment capable of destroying the hæmatozoon as quickly as possible, so that after giving Santonin a trial, Iodic-Hydrarg was employed but with negative results, so that one was forced to fall back upon Arsenic in the form of Liq.

lxxi again rose in the evening a little over a degree and registered 38°C. on the morning of the 9th, the pulse being 60 and respirations 12, but the hæmatozoon was absent from the blood. It will thus be observed on reference to the chart, that five days and a half had elapsed since the commencement of the Arsenical treatment and during that period, fifty-six grains had been given in the drinking water. For the next two days the dose was increased to fourteen grains per diem, in order to try and effect the destruction of any immature forms of the organism which might be present in the blood. The temperature on the morning of the second day registered 36.5°C, the animal presented a brighter appearance and some further absorption of the exudation on the under-surface of the abdomen had taken place, although that of the limbs continued unabated. During the period which elapsed between the 11th of December 1892 and the 4th January 1893, the Arsenical treatment was con- tinued. The Surra hæmatozoon was absent from the blood. The maximum dose of grains vii was again exhibited on the 14th and loth December, but from the latter date it was gradually reduced by one grain at a time until the minimum of grains iii was reached on the 3rd January. On the 16th December the animal com- menced to lose flesh rapidly, although previous to that date it had become to a certain extent emaciated within the limits of health. From this date, however, in spite of the amount of food consumed, progressive atrophy of the muscles set in, especially along either side of the spinal column and those surrounding the hip-joints and buttocks.

The pulse was hard, frequent 56, and dicrotous, and the respirations were increased in frequency, 24 per minute. On microscopical examination of the blood, numerous hæroatozoa were observed. By mid-day the temperature had risen to 40.3°C., but it had again fallen to 39.1°C. by 5 P.M., and half an hour later an eruption of Urbica,ria was sparsely scattered over the body, which commenced to fade each evening but re- appeared each morning until the 3rd December. On the morning of the 30th the tem- perature had fallen to 38.6°C, P. 52, and the respirations from 28 the previous evening to 12 per minute, the organisms being very numerous in the blood, the urine however was not collected. On this day the animal was placed upon an Arsenical treat- ment consisting of the full physiological dose to begin with, viz., gr. iv bis die. This was continued for two days, when it was increased to gr. v bis die. On the morning of the 7th day of the disease a natural intermission took place most probably, for the hæmatozoon was absent from the blood and remained so until. the 10th day, when a few were found on microscopical examination. This proved but an abortive attempt on the part of the hæmatozoon, for on the following day only a few were again observed, and on the 8th December, the 12th day, none could be seen; thus proving that the Arsenic was taking effect. From this latter date until the evening of January 1st, 1893, the 36th of the disease, the temperature never rose above 38.7°C. and for the greater part of the time was below 38°C. The hæmatozoon had been absent from the general circulation for a period of twenty-five clays and the animal presented a very satisfactory appearance. Conse- quently the treatment was discontinued on that evening, and on the morning of the follow- ing day, but was again exhibited on the evening of the latter day. On the 3rd January, the 38th day, the organism again made its appearance in the blood.

xciii On the day of admission and the day following, the urine only contained a few Carbo- nate and Oxalate crystals, together with a considerable amount of Phosphates. On the 13th December, granular casts and a few red blood corpuscles were discovered, but no albumen. This condition existed until the 22nd, when very numerous granular casts from the wide and narrow tubes were present, together with crystals of Carbonate and Oxalate of Lime, but there was a total absence of albumen and blood. On the 25th, the urine assumed a greenish-orange colour, and a trace of bile pigment was found on examination. Later from the 9th to the 11th of January, a few blood casts, leucocytes and vesical epithelium were noticed ; but from the 13th to the 25th, on which latter date death occurred, only very few granular casts, a trace of bile pigment and the usual crystals were present.

On the morning of the 24th, the temperature fell to 37.7°C. and the hæmatozoa were few, and by the following day the former registered 37.5°C. and the latter was absent from the blood. From this date until the evening of the 28th,- the temperature steadily rose until it attained a maximum of 40.4°C. at 5 P.M., the organisms being present in small numbers in the blood. One hour later the animal suddenly passed some ten ounces of urine, of a dark-red colour, which on microscopical examination was found to contain a few red corpuscles and blood casts. By the morning of the 29th, the temperature had fallen 1.4°C. and continued to do so until 8 A.M. on January 1st, 1893, when it registered 36.8°C. During this period the hæmatozoon was absent from the blood. On the evening of the same day the temperature again rose to 39.4°C. but again fell two degrees by the morning of the 2nd at which time the organism had again appeared in the circulation, and continued present until the 7th.

With this end in view. small quantities of blood mixed with a large hulk of water were to he given at short intervals. Accordingly on the 4th May. four drops of blood swarming with the Surra hæmatozoa. mixed with one gallon of fresh water were given to the animal to drink. Up to the 9th no change at all had taken place in the animal's condition ; and on this date. eight drops of blood containing numerous hærnatozoa were given in the same way. On the 10th and 11th. the animal showed no change. On the 11th six drops of blood containing Surra hæmatozoa were given in a quart of water. On the 12th. a few small petechiæ were noticed on the membranæ nictitantes. Up to the 24th. with the exception of a slight indisposition on the 18th. which rapidly passed off. no symptoms of disease were noticed. On the 24th. he received eight drops of blood containing very numerous hæmatozoa. in two quarts of water ; but no changes of any importance were noticed up to the 6th June; and on this date. the animal received eight drops of blood. containing numerous hæmatozoa. in water. No change was observed till the 14th June. when thirty minims of blood containing very numerous hæmatozoa. were administered in three quarts of water. On the 16th no change having taken place. ten drops of blood swarming with hæmatozoa were given in water. On the 17th June. twenty-five drops containing no hæmatozoa. but taken from Horse No. XXIII suffering from Surra were given in a gallon of water. From this date up to the 28th June. no change was noticed. On the latter date two hundred minims of blood containing very numerous hæmatozoa. were given in a bucket of water. From this date (June 28th) up to the 1st September. absolutely no symptom of disease was noticed; but from this date until the 6th September. there was a very slight disturbance of tempera- ture. which. however. remained normal. On the 11th September the temperature had risen to 39.4°C. in the morning. and numerous Surra hæmatozoa were observed in the blood; the temperature at noon had risen to 40.4°C. and ranged for the next few days between 38.3° C. and 41° C. during which period the hæmatozoa were swarming in the blood.. For the next three days. the 16th. 17th. 18th. the temperature varied between 38.3° C. and 39.6° C. and during this period the hæmatozoa were absent. On the 19th. the temperature was normal. but a slight eruption appeared on the skin of the fore and hind quarters. and the hind limbs became swollen and [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page]

(iv). The fever in this case. as the charts show. was of a well marked relapsing type. and exhibits six distinct relapses. but with no regularity as to the periods during which they lasted. The appearance and increase in numbers of the hæmatozoa in the blood was more or less accompanied by a corresponding rise of the temperature. (V).

The action of the medicine had a marked effect upon the animal; but the hæma- tozoa, after being few in the blood for 3 days and absent during 24 hours, again became numerous, and remained so until the animal's death. The animal did not rally from the effect of the medicine; but the hæmatozoa were apparently unaffected by it. Death occur- red on the 10th January.

ccxxi GUINEA-PIGS Nos. VII and VIII. March 14th, 1892.ccxxii No. VII.[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] BULL NO. 1. INOCULATED WITH HORSE SURRA, 24 MARCH 1891. RE-INOCULATED, 22 AUGT. 1892. PHOTOGRAPHED, 23 NOV. 1892.
ccxxiii mens were examined every day. Consequently two more Guinea-pigs were inoculated. These were distinguished as Nos. III and IV and each received 0.2c.c. of blood drawn from the ear of the Bull, with antiseptic precautions, on the 163rd day after the inoculation of the animal with Surra. No. III developed Surra hæmatozoa in its blood on the tenth day following inoculation, and these were present with few exceptions until the day of its death, October 24th, 1891, fifty-one days after inoculation. No. IV developed Surra hæmatozoa also on the tenth day after inoculation, and they remained almost constantly present in the blood until the day of death on the 14th December 1891, one hundred and two days after inoculation. During the period which elapsed between September 3rd, on which Guinea-pigs III and IV were inoculated, and November 13th, 1891, the morning and evening temperatures of the Bull oscillated as much as two or more degrees ; no hæmatozoa were discovered, although, as before stated, great care was bestowed upon the examination of the blood each day. On November 13th, 1891, that is, 234 days after the inoculation of the Bull, two Guinea- pigs V and VI were inoculated with 0.2c.c. of blood from the Bulls' ear, but as no hæma- toza were found during the next 32 days, they were re-inoculated on the 16th December 1891, 267 days after the inoculation of the Bull, but with negative results a second time. Between the latter date, December 16th, 1891, and March 14th, 1892, the Bull appeared to be enjoying good health and putting on flesh. On this date March 14th, 1892, that is, 356 days from the time of inoculation, two new Guinea-pigs VII and VIII were inoculated as previously described with 0.2c.c. of blood from the ear of the Bull, but these experiments were followed by negative results. Since March 14th, the Bull has been in very fine con- dition, and as it is desirable to ascertain whether animals of the bovine species are liable to a second attack of Surra, it was resolved to re-inoculate this animal with a more virulent type of Surra obtained by passing the hæmatozoon of the rat (Mus decumanus) through the horse and donkey. This second inoculation was performed on August 22nd, 1892, at 11 A.M., 1 c.c. of blood drawn from the Jugular Vein of the donkey being injected subcutaneously over the left shoulder, the blood at the time containing very numerous and active hæmatozoa.

That Guinea-pigs inoculated with the same Bull's blood on the 234th, 267th and 356th day respectively after the inoculation of the animal, should remain healthy and at no time develop hæmatozoa in their blood. That the blood withdrawn from the Bull on the 163rd day after inoculation should prove to be more virulent than that taken on the 85th day, as demonstrated by the second pair of Guinea-pigs dying on the 51st and 102nd day respectively, although the first animals did not succumb until the 117th and 144th day. That the Bull should be able to throw off the disease (Surra) entirely and become strong and fat, is worthy of notice and may prove important in the future treatment of the disease, especially when we recall the absolute fatality observed amongst horses afflicted with this disease. On the 512th day after the appearance of the hæmatozoon in the blood of the animal it was subjected to re-inoculation, this time with blood containing the hæmatozoon of a more virulent type. The fact that the blood of the Bull should, by inoculation, be capable of reproducing the disease 155 days after the last appearance of the hæmatozoon in it, is a very important one from a clinical point of view, showing the length of time during which an animal must be kept under observation, before being pronounced safe. Although the hæmatozoon is capable of growth in the blood of cattle, it nevertheless does not appear to be a very suitable medium for its development, as it apparently loses much of its virulence, producing only a mild form of the disease. This loss of virulence on introduction of the hæmatozoon into the bovine species, rather points to the fact that there may be a possibility of producing some form of immunity in other species of animals, by the introduction, subcutaneously or by intravenous injection, either of the blood itself or of the proteid material obtained from the blood of bovines, some time after their inoculation with Surra. It appears possible that cattle may contract the disease if submitted to the same con- dition as horses, which are supposed to contract Surra by drinking water or grazing on low lands, which have been previously flooded and where the contagium is present. And although suffering from a mild form, may be the means of distributing the virus over a considerable area. This may account for some of the numerous cases of fever in cattle, the nature and causes of which, up to the present, have not been made out.

ccxxvii 1st April 1891-Temp. A.M. 41.1°C. P.M. 41 .7°C. No hæmatozoa observed in the blood. 2nd ccxxviii purulent material from the right nostril. The hæmatozoon was absent from the nasal fluid, but present in that drawn from tunica vaginalis on the same date. It continued however to be absent from the blood. On the 105th day after the re-inoculation, the animal presented symptoms of loss of power on the left side, involving both fore and hind limbs, but it could walk for a short distance without falling. During the whole interval from the first inoculation to the date of death, covering a period of 127 days, the hæmatozoon was never discovered in the blood, although it was found on the 45th day in the fluid from the left tunica vaginalis testis. It is a point of extreme interest that even in the absence of the hæmatozoon, such grave cerebral symptoms presented themselves and were accounted for at the Autopsy by the amount of fluid in the lateral ventricles, especially the right. On the eighteenth day after re-inoculation as the hæmatozoon had not been discovered in the blood, it was de- cided to inoculate two Guinea-pigs with blood from the animal, in order to prove whether the organism existed in any form in the general circulation. This accordingly was done and each animal received subcutaneously .7 c.c. of blood drawn from the ear of the sheep. In the case of one Guinea-pig, the hæmatozoon appeared in the blood in ten, and in the other after an interval of fourteen days. Eventually death took place in the former after 58 days, and in the latter 139 days after inoculation. It is, therefore, clinically a point of supreme importance to bear in mind, that the blood of a sheep previously inoculated with the hæmatozoon of horse Surra, may at a much later period contain, although probably impossible of demonstration, the particulate con- tagium which on being introduced into the circulation of another animal, has the power of reproducing the disease.

ccxlix The time which elapsed from the inoculation of the animal until the first appearance of the organism in the blood, occupied nine days. The organism continued to be present off and on during a period of eighty-eight days, the time which elapsed from the inoculation until death, being ninety-seven.

That when the hæmatozoon had once appeared in the blood, viz., on December 16th, 1890, it should not have continued to increase in numbers, and the disease run the usual course. (iii). That at a later period, after inoculation with horse's blood containing the hæma- tozoon, the organism should appear in the blood, after a period of incubation lasting six days, and be observed microscopically on 107 out of the 113 days during which the animal survived.

cclxvi SUBCUTANEOUS INOCULATION OF SMALL ANIMALS WITH THE URINE OF A HORSE IN AN ADVANCED STAGE OF ' SURRA.' These experiments were undertaken with a double object:cclxvii Remarks. (i). It will thus be observed from the above experiments on a Guinea-pig and a rabbit that during the evolution of the bio-chemical morbid process (Surra), no toxic principles have been found in the urine at an advanced period of the disease. (ii). That during a period of fourteen days after two injections of considerable quan- tities of the suspected urine, no hæmatozoa have been discovered in the blood of the inoculated animals, and that after a period of eleven months, during which time the subjects of inoculation have been under continual observation, they still remain alive and healthy. (iii). Hence, that if the hæmatozoa are excreted through the agency of the kidneys, it would appear to be of no great clinical importance, as they must be either dead or incapable of reproduction.
