CHAPTER I. ADMINISTRATIVE DETAILS. Nov. 7th to Dec. 18th 1900. May 4th to May 31st 1901. The Municipal Commissioner, Mr. W. L. Harvey, I. C.

CHAPTER II. THE COURSE OF THE EPIDEMIC. Population in Bombay. The Imperial Decennial Census was taken on March 1st, and gives the results detailed in the accompanying statement. Though at the time the Census was taken Plague was raging with considerable intensity, there is no reason to suppose that the population was appreciably below the normal, acquiescence in the Plague measures having prevented people from running away, and evacuation having been carried out within the limits of the City. Compared with the previous year there was a marked decrease in the number of famine-stricken immigrants. Statement Showing the Population of the City by Sections on 1st March 1901. Serial No. Wards.

The course of the epidemic is traced below district by district and a review of its effects taken month by month concludes the chapter. A Ward. Upper Colaba section of this ward was practically clear until April 1901, when 5 Plague cases were found amongst the servants and followers of the military, who form a considerable proportion of the population. The Lunatic Asylum had one case for the first time, whilst cases were noted in Dhobi Ghaut and the Cattle Lines in the month of May. The vigilant watch kept by the Military authorities on the sanitary condition of this section prevented the disease from assuming epidemic proportions. In Middle and Lower Colaba there was a slight recrudescence in September. The epidemic proper commenced in January 1901, with many cases in Hamal Street, Thomas Street and Maneekjee Street, and especially in Victoria Bunder. Three Europeans attacked in Colaba Causeway recovered. Plague then spread all over the Section and reached its highest point in the second week in March 1901, after which it slowly declined. Fort, North.-This section is the most thickly populated one in the ward. There was a monsoon recrudescence in September, but the epidemic proper started in December, in Modi Street, Mungesh Senoy Street, Bazaar Gate Street and Hornby Road, where the poorer classes live. The same places were attacked with Plague this year that were attacked last year. Ten cases occurred in the 21st Bombay Infantry and dead rats were found in their lines before the outbreak, but these rodents were not found in such great numbers as in the year past. The epidemic reached
?9 its worst stage in the 3rd week of February from which time it declined gradually. Fort, South.-This locality being full of offices has the smallest population in the ward. Dead rats began to be found in the first week of February mostly around Hummum Street and Elphinstone Circle. This was followed by cases of Plague amongst the servants who slept in the offices at night and amongst syces in stables. Esplanade.-This section was the hunting ground of famine immigrants and destitute beggars, and they were the chief sufferers. They lived on the open maidans and wandered about begging for food and alms in Fort, North. There were cases also in the Municipal chawls at Pultan Road. In January and February there were cases in the lines of the 2nd Bombay Grenadiers. The figures for the year are here given showing by sections the monthly totals of Plague cases and deaths :-It should be noted that a person discovered sick with plague is called a "case," and if he subsequently dies he is not entered again as a death.

10 Communities Attacked.-Lower castes of Hindoos suffered most, but it is noticeable that Mahomedans and the Koli fisher folk escaped infection this year. With regard to beggars, Capt. Lockhart Mure comments as follows:- Beggars.-Beggars have no doubt been a frequent source of infection in the Fort this year. They were very numerous and infested the Fort principally owing, I suppose, to the wealth of the residents there. Natives of India are notoriously charitable and residents must frequently have had infection brought to their houses in this way. This nuisance has now been removed by the use of the Goculdas Tejpal Camp and since the removal of the beggars there, I have noticed that the good houses have ceased having Plague. Rats.-Capt. Lockhart Mure reports as follows concerning rats:- I consider that rats are a sure precursor of Plague, and I have noticed that dead rats invariably herald an outbreak. Could the people be persuaded to at once report the presence of dead rats and to have the house disinfected, I am quite certain that many an outbreak could be prevented. Instant evacuation, till after disinfection, is highly desirable, and should, if possible, be insisted on. I can quote several examples, of the efficacy of disinfecting at once on the appearance of dead rats, but it will perhaps suffice to give the following:- Dead rats were reported in the Commercial Bank. This was disinfected at once and no Plague followed. They were found in Standard Buildings on five or six different occasions within about a fortnight. Thorough disinfection was carried out each time and not a single case has taken place. In Upper Colaba many dead rats have been reported, but there has been no outbreak of Plague though a few sporadic cases have occurred. Last year the epidemic was very severe there, but owing to constant supervision, the prevention of overcrowding in the houses and the immediate reporting of dead rats, there has been hardly any Plague this year. On the other hand a severe outbreak took place in Colaba village. On enquiring I found that the people had noticed dead rats for several days previously, had not reported the fact and had not had the houses disinfected. Hence the outbreak. It is very easy to see the danger that the neighbours run. Rats go from one house to another, carrying the infection with them and often, before the first case of plague takes place and the infected quarter is discovered, many houses have been infected. In fact, you are in the midst of an epidemic before you even know one house is infected. B Ward, South. Mandvi.-There was a severe monsoon recrudescence which having declined by November, broke out into a fierce epidemic in the month of February arriving at its maximum in march when the total mortality for the week ending the 19th was 151, the highest ever experienced. The mortality in Koli Wada, Danabunder Vaigad and Chinchbunder was very great. The first mentioned is a highly insanitary locality and the inhabitants mostly low caste Hindus live in a very overcrowded state. In one of the houses in this locality there were 8 Plague cases in 5 days. Communities Attacked.-The District Officer reports that Ghati Hindus suffered most, Lohanas and Banias somewhat less, while Mahomedans were comparatively free and the Bene-Israelites were hardly affected at all. The poorest people suffered most. Rats.-Lieutenant Shakespeare is a firm believer in the theory that plague is spread by rats but notices that the people prefer to conceal the fact that rats have died of Plague rather than have their rooms dis- infected in anticipation of Plague occurring. The plague staff in this district found no great number of plague-stricken rats. Yet, in this part of the city enormous quantities of grain are stored and rats must be proportionately numerous.
?11 Localities Infected.-The worst infected spots were Coorla Street, Clive Road, Surat Street, Musjid Station Road, DeSouza Street and Bhandari Lane. In these there were cases of Plague ranging in numbers from 10 to 34. In DeSouza Street there were no less than 89 people attacked, the majority of whom died. In Old Bengalpura there were no less than 41 cases ; in Dongri Street 98 ; in Argyle Road 62. The virulence of the epidemic from February 26th to March 19th this year exceeded that of all previous epidemics, but the people bore it with equanimity and resignation. The figures of plague attacks and deaths for each month of the year are given here :- WARD B-SOUTH. Sections. Population. June 1900. July 1900. August 1900. September 1900. October 1900.

There was a recrudescence in the month of September, but the real epidemic commenced in January and attained its height in March 1901, from which time it began to decline. No Streets or sections were entirely free from plague, but Dongri, Samuel and Nishanpada Streets have a much better record than Naoroji Hill and Umarkhadi, due to their being occupied by comparatively wealthy people. In Umarkhadi and Naoroji Hill overcrowding is common and produces conditions undoubtedly favourable to Plague. The District Officer (Lieut. Dalgliesh) urges energetic action against the landlord
?12 Infected Areas.-On the subject of permanent plague centres Lieut. Dalgliesh writes as follows :- As regards infected localities and houses one has only to compare the street circles for the last two years to be struck by the remarkable extent the same houses become re-infected. In every street there are certain notorious houses which are simply hot beds of plague and become re-infected year after year, while the other houses remain comparatively free. I am of opinion that the entire evacuation of such houses at the commencement of an epidemic or when the first case of plague occurs in them, would do good in checking the spread of the disease. The inhabitants might be segregated for a month, and then allowed to live in some other house. The evacuated house meanwhile might be disinfected at regular intervals but not allowed to be re-occupied so long as the prevailing epidemic was in existence. The ground belonging to the Port Trust on both sides of the Elphinstone Bridge Camp, at present occupied by cattle sheds and huts, might be utilised for erecting camps to provide accommodation for people evicted from these houses. The figures of plague cases and deaths month by month throughout the year are as follows :- WARD B-NORTH. Sections. Population. June 1900. July 1900. August 1900. September 1900. October 1900.

This ward includes perhaps the most overcrowded and insanitary portions of Bombay. Market.-There was a slight recrudescence in September, but the epidemic only became general throughout the section in January 1901. The total mortality for the week ending 12th February 1901 was 170, the highest on record. The disease showed a marked preference for particular houses in Antoba Wadi, Patak Wadi, Mahajan Wadi and Otak Wadi. These were houses with mud floors and walls inhabited by the
13 poorer classes. Rats were found dying from the middle of January and are accused by the District Officer and Medical Officer of being the prime agents for dissemination of the disease. Very few cases, however, occurred among beggars and homeless people. Dhobi Talao.-There was a recrudescence in September and October, which commenced severely, but in the month of November plague almost disappeared. The real epidemic began in the following month, reached its climax in about the first week in February and slowly subsided. All parts of the section were attacked simultaneously. Evacuation was large- ly adopted and in the case of 3rd Marine Lines and Mahadev Street with beneficial results. Fanaswadi.-Here also there was a monsoon recrudescence, but the epidemic proper commenced in January 1901 in Anant Wadi and from thence spread southwards, reaching its climax about the third week in March. Rats were found dying in November and December and attacks were numerous in the localities where they died. Nana's Wadi Patras Chawls and Parmanand Wadi were the chief places re-infected this year and the habits of the people combined with the overcrowding in- creased the dangers of infection. Bhuleshwar.-This is the most thickly populated of all the sections. The epidemic commenced in the last week of December 1900. There are a large number of merchants and Bunnias, who though poor, live cleaner lives than other lower caste Hindus, it is quite possible that this has enabled them to escape more easily from plague infection than other castes. In any case the total mortality of the section was lower last year than this year. The epidemic first broke out in the Bhoiwadas and Panjrapole Streets and from thence spread to other parts of the section. Lohars and Kathiawari beggars were the first to fall victims to the disease. Many of them rented small rooms in the Bhoiwadas and thus made the overcrowding a great deal worse. The epidemic was at its worst in March after which it declined gradually. Dead rats were found fully six weeks before the real epidemic com- menced. Kumbharwada Section.-Plague commenced in epidemic proportions at the end of December 1900, rose rapidly through January and February 1901, and reached its maximum in the first week in March; from that time there was a gradual decline. The epidemic commenced in Bhandari Street and then gradually spread over the whole section. In 1st Carpen- ter Street the plague travelled regularly from South to North. Duncan Road, Kumbharwada and Northbrook Street suffered severely. Here are to be found low caste Hindus living in an overcrowded state and on a meagre diet. Increased mortality in Carpenter Street among the better class of Hindus is attributed to delay in evacuation.
14 Rats were found dying as early as October 1900, but the people would never give any information about them for fear of having their houses disinfected or being sent to camp. Disinfection has not given satisfactory results in this section, the strictest supervision having failed to prevent the early re-infection of disinfected houses. It was noticed that almost every street had a rise and then a fall in plague, followed after an interval by a lesser rise and fall. Kumbharwada Street, for instance, was worst in January 1901, then fell in February, and after an interval rose again until it was bad in April. The total plague mortality was much higher than last year's, although it is considered that the population of this section during the present year has been much less.

Smith reports as follows :- Taking the ward as a whole, the plague epidemic may be said to have commenced all over the ward at once. No particular localities were affected first. Dhobi Talao has apparently escaped somewhat, but that is due to a very large number of the inhabitants vacating their houses.
15 This was also done by the inhabitants of New Wadi in Fanaswadi who left their houses and went outside the city as soon as plague became bad in Zaoba's Oart which is close at hand. The result was they escaped epidemic plague, thus pointing to the value of evacuation. Some of the watchmen left to look after the houses died of plague. The examples given by Doctor Bardi in his Bhuleshwar report of rat mortality in epi- demic form preceding that in human beings by a period of about six weeks bears out my conclusions in adopting this view as true in fact. There is no doubt that from what the sectional medical officers report, that rats play a primary and most important part in the dissemination of plague poison and that it is due to them that human beings become infected. It will be noticed also that the poorer classes suffered very severely, indeed, from the plague. This being due to overcrowding insanitary dwellings and, doubtless, also to want of stamina due to the indifferent food they eat and the hard life they lead. As regards re-infection of localities there is no doubt, that localities previously infected become re-infected. But 1 think that sufficient stress is not laid on the fact that these loca- lities are as a rule ones in which the houses have mud floors and soft walls ( i.e., not burnt brick or stone and mortar ). The course of the epidemic this year was not affected appreciably in any way either by famine or famine-stricken refugees. The case of No. 21, 2nd Phophal Wadi in Bhuleshwar, I consider, distinctly points to the extreme efficacy of disinfection in houses in which rats die. During the cholera epidemic C Ward suffered very severely but the people seemed to accept their fate with resignation. Medicines were freely offered and in many cases accepted by the poorer classes. D Ward. Khetwadi.-There was a slight recrudescence in the months of October and November, but the epidemic gathered strength in the last week of January and was in full force throughout February up to the middle of March when there was a fall which continued through May. The present epidemic was more severe than that of last year and ap- pears to have spread into Khetwadi from C Ward. Girgaum.-This section may be said to have escaped a monsoon recrudescence. The epidemic commenced in the second week of January and was at its worst in the third week of March when 84 plague deaths were recorded; but in comparison with last year the disease was less fatal in its effects. Chowpaty.-There was no monsoon recrudescence, but it is import- ant to note that in D Ward the epidemic first started in this section in a locality known as Bhatwady where dead rats were found followed by deaths amongst the inhabitants. This was in the first week in January. Increasing in the second week there was soon after a distinct decrease in the death-rate owing to the whole quarter being evacuated. But infection was carried on to the adjoining lanes and the mortality again increased and reached its maximum in the first week of February. Evacuation continuing, the epidemic declined, but the district remained infected to the end of the year. It is noted that last year the epidemic was at its worst in August and September, whilst this year the section was attacked in February and March. Excepting this year, this section has always been the last to be attacked in the district.
16 Walkeshwar.-This section was practically clear of plague from July up to the end of December. But the epidemic proper commenced in February and was at its worst in the first week of April 1901, when there was a decided fall which was most noticeable in the commencement of May. This year the best quarters were attacked first, and there seems little doubt that infection was brought from Mandvi and Dongri by the servants of some of the wealthier people living in the section. Mahaluxmi was free from plague during July and August, and there was no regular monsoon recrudescence. The epidemic commenced in the third week of December increasing in January and February. It reached its maximum in the second week of March. There was a slow decline in April followed by a rapid one to the close of the year. This year the epidemic was more than twice as bad as last year, the lower caste Hindus appearing to have suffered very much.

17 Infected Areas.-In Girgaum plague attacked a place called Sarkari Tabella in Girgaum Main Road and from this locality in January it spread to Kandewady and Mugbhat, Benham Hall Lane and Bhatwady. Dead rats were reported previous to the people being attacked. In Khetwadi plague commenced in Khetwady Back Road. The Falkland Cross Lanes all became badly infected as happens nearly every year, and in a short time cases were occurring in all parts of the section. Capt. Dunbar Stuart remarks upon the infection of Walkeshwar and Mahaluxmi as follows:- In Walkeshwar and Mahaluxmi it began in January; especially prevalent in Walke- shwar, in Banaganga Temple Compound probably through Sadoos, &c. In Mahaluxmi all the old places were re-infected this year, especially Tardeo Road, Forjett Street, Pedder Road and Warden Road, I should say, through rats. Napean Sea Road got infected all through rats. Communities Attacked.-Capt. Stuart is of opinion that it is the loca- lity which is mainly responsible for infection. That if Brahmins had to live in the same hovels and places as the poorer Hindoos, they would be attacked just the same. Though it is possible, he says, they being of cleaner habits might not suffer as much. Rats.-With regard to rats he says:- I am convinced that rats were and are the cause of all the plague infection, i. e., being the means of carrying it about from street to street. Dead rats were found in Altamount Road after which plague appeared, Napean Sea Road is another example. The appearance of dead rats was always a warning to the people. In Girgaum the inhabitants appreciated this warning and removed themselves into camps at Sion, Dadar and elsewhere. Famine Refugees and Beggars.-This District was not bothered with emigrants or vaga- bonds. There is no place where they can put up. The only places where one comes across common ailments amongst them such as fevers, diarrhoea, &c. are at the two temple compounds- Banaganga and Mahaluxmi. It being a point of honor that all beggars diseased or otherwise can always get food of sorts from the people in attendance there, &c. E Ward, West. Lieut. Ballantyne traces the course of the epidemic as follows.:- Course of the Epidemic.-In the ward the epidemic commenced on the 29th December from which date the mortality steadily increased in Kamatipura and Tardeo sections. In 1st Nagpada plague did not assume the form of an epidemic till about the 19th January. In Kamatipura the highest plague mortality was recorded in the week ending 9th February 1901 when 110 actual plague cases were recorded. In 1st Nagpada the highest plague mortality occurred in week ending 2nd March 1901 when 62 cases were registered. In Tardeo the week ending 2nd March 1901 plague was at its highest when 63 plague cases occurred. Taking Ward E, West as a whole, the highest plague mortality was in week ending 2nd March 1901, when 216 cases were recorded. There was a sudden fall in the month of April but the epidemic continued up to the close of the year. In Kamatipura the epidemic began to diminish in virulence from the week ending 2nd March 1901 when plague cases fell from 109 to 88 in the next week. In 1st Nagpada from 16th March the epidemic began to abate when plague cases fell from 59 to 45. In Tardeo plague commenced to decline in the week ending 9th March, cases falling from 57 to 42.
?18 In Kamatipura the portion most attacked was that between Bazaar Road and Centre Road, mostly occupied by Telegus and Marathas of the poor classes. In Tardeo no particular portion was affected more than another, but the plague was practically confined to Ghattis, Vanjaris, Marathas and Mahars-all poor classes. Influence of Rats.-Dead rats were found in large numbers in this ward, in many cases they were found on the roadside, evidently having been thrown out of the houses in which they were found. In many cases the houses could not be traced but this nearly always occurred in a badly infected street. Practically the same localities were infected, but they were attacked nearly six weeks later than during the last epidemic. There were no famine-stricken people in this ward and very few immigrant vagabonds. The figures for plague attacks and deaths are tabulated below :- WARD E, WEST. Sections. Population. June 1900.

He further states that although sanitary and structural improvements were carried out in some of the chawls in Kamatipura yet they were infected to the same extent as last year, but there were some which were free from the disease this year, though they were infected last year. He remarks as follows on the influence of rats :- Dead rats, in my opinion, play an important part in the propagation of the epidemic, and the appearance of plague cases in general is preceded at least a fortnight or more, by rat mortality. It is almost impossible to give definitely the history of dead rats on account of the ignorance of the people residing in the section, who avoid giving any information and even
19 try to mislead us for fear of plague measures, and hence no reliable data are available, except where well-to-do and intelligent people have vacated their premises and removed to suburbs or health camps at Dadar or Matunga, and on enquiry the cause of their shifting is generally found to be that dead rats were repeatedly found on their premises. In the following examples a definite history was available. 1. R. S. Manaji Ragojee, a volunteer member, vacated his premises in Kamati- pura 3rd Street, No. 99, and went to live at Bandra about the middle of January. Before he left dead rats were repeatedly found, but a Bhaia remained in charge, and a fortnight after, this man was attacked with plague and succumbed. 2. Mr. Gaula, practising in this district, vacated his quarters in Kamatipura 3rd Street, No. 130, about the beginning of April 1901, as several dead rats were found in the chawl. His rooms were disinfected, but the grain dealers residing next door protested, denying that dead rats were ever found on their premises. Their rooms were not disinfected. A week or so after one of the inmates was attacked with plague and died on 18th April 1901. 3. A plague death occurred in Kamatipura 12th Street, No. 67-73 on 6th February 1901. When the place was disinfected several dead rats were found. They were sent to the Parel Laboratory for examination and declared full of plague bacilli. There was another plague death on the 8th and a third on the 9th February, and subsequently the chawl got badly infected, plague cases almost occurring everyday until the inmates were induced to vacate the premises when the chawl was thoroughly disinfected. Dr. Khote, Sectional Medical Officer of Tardeo, states that there was only a slight monsoon recrudescence before the epidemic broke out. During the fifteen weeks the latter lasted it is noticed that the attacks were more numerous, but the deaths were smaller in number than last year. He reports as follows on the localities attacked:- As for localities that were attacked, it may be said that the whole of Tardeo section was infected with the exception of the following parts:-(1) Gilder Street Cross Lanes, (2) Foras Road portion extending from the junction of Gilder Street and Foras Road, and running by the side of Grant Road station, (3) Grant Road portion, (4) Falkland Road portion extending from the Dharamshala to the Arab Lane excluding chawls Nos. 390 and 410. The chawls that were badly infected were Bapty Road No. 227, Gilder Street No. 27, Gilder Street No. 51-53, Gilder Street 1-21, Gilder Street Nos. 108 and 4 Jairajbhai Street Nos. 2 and 3, Foras Road Nos. 49, 79, 84 and 120, Balaram Street Nos. 410 and 3. The people residing in these challs were mostly Mahrattas, Ghatis, Vanjaris and Mahars, who suffered very severely. Remarks on Localities Attacked.-It has been generally found that insanitary and over- crowded chawls are usually infected, and that most of the chawls that were attacked during the previous years had a renewed visitation and infection this year. It should be noted, however, that some of the chawls that were badly infected last year had few attacks this year although no sanitary and structural improvements have been made. Such chawls are Arab Lane No. 3, Suklaji Street No. 40, Suklaji Street No. 120-126, Falkland Road No. 23 Gilder Street No. 42-58. People in these chawls did not leave their rooms during the course of the epidemic. Further, it has been observed that though sanitary improvements were made last year in some parts of the chawls, yet they were again infected this year. These chawls were Balaram Street No. 410 and Foras Road No. 78. E Ward, Wari Bunder District. The decline of the epidemic previous to the one under report may be said to have been completed by the end of June 1900, from which month up to October the district was practically free from Plague. The usual recrudescence was slight and by November its effects had abated to normal conditions.
?20 The epidemic commenced in December attained its zenith in March, and was maintaining an obstinate hold on the district up to the end of the year. The figures for plague cases and deaths for the year are given below: - WARD E-(WARI BUNDER). Sections. Population. June 1900. July 1900. August 1900. September 1900. October 1900. November 1900.

Moore comments on the course of the epidemic as follows :- The epidemic in this ward ( Tarwadi Side ) began in the large chawl situated in Mazagon Road, Houses Nos. 6, 6BB, 6D, and No. 12, Babula Tank Road, early in December. These houses consist of five floors each of 20 rooms and each room-owner "boards" or takes in about 10 "boarders" besides their own family. The "boarders" are Marathas who pay so much per head for their food and sleep in the passages mostly. Practically all are "Dock-labourers and pass down everyday through Ward B, South to the various Docks in B Ward. These chawls are built on sanitary principles, are practically well off as regards ventilation having been greatly improved at the instance of Mr. Lund who did so much for this ward during the year 1900-1901. They are supplied with large central ventilations from top to bottom centre of each block, also large gratings at the end of each passage and good sized windows to each room. Houses are kept very fairly clean and there is actually no room for rats and nothing to attract them. I have been several times to the different "Bunders" in B Ward South to find out how, and where, the disease is picked up, but cannot explain the cause except that large crowds of coolies are daily collected together at these bunders. It is not traceable to any
?21 particular Department as I have traced cases to almost every wharf in the docks. These coolies do their day's work and then are paid off. A man feels sick, he lies down behind a stack of wood or coal or bales of cotton, remains there, perhaps, for a couple of days. He then crawls back to one of the abovementioned boarding houses and is so bad when found that he cannot be removed, and this seems to be the almost invariable history of the cases in this particular centre. These houses have been disinfected by rooms (after cases) and repeatedly by floors but without effect, since they are constantly reinfected by imported cases. From these the epidemic spread North from end to end through Tarwadi, 41 to 45, Nesbit Road, a compound with three large single storied chawls known as the "Cudda." Infection is supposed to be due to dead rats attracted by the filth collected by a rag and hone-merchant. Houses are inhabited by about 450 people mostly low caste Mahars employed at P. & O. Docks and G. I. P. and B. B. & C. 1. Workshops. These places have since been condemned as unfit for human habitation and are now being practically re-built on sanitary principles. Next, No. 8, Hyderalli's chawls. Infection: a beggar from D. Ward who died in the Compound. Then No. 12, Nawab's compound infected by rats. Lastly, Love Lane which was a good deal more free this year than last. A good many respectable houses are in this neighbourhood and improvements in ventilation, &c., are made since last year. Thence the epidemic attacked Bawan's Chawls, Moorgiwalla's Chawls, Dhakji Purbhu's Wadi, Sussex Road, and right on to Kala-Chowki Road at the North end of the section. After this it spread about, odd cases here and there, and certain localities seeming never free, particularly the large boarding houses abovementioned. Mazagon Side.-Early in October Plague started in 14, Belvedere Road, first case im- ported from Mandvi. Then 10 cases occurred in No. 14, Stringent measures were taken, whole house vacated, and moved to Wari Bunder Camp.  One case, however, escaped and spread Plague in No. 43, Wari Bunder Road. Early in January cases occurred in No. 7, Belvedere Road, No. 9, Belvedere Road, Anjirwadi, 2nd Carpenter Street Nos. 23 and 27 particularly, 14 Gurupdeo Road, Ambewadi. There were 36 deaths in this neighbourhood from Plague alone. Then Hussonalli's Chawls and Reay Road at the end of January. Next, 1st Car- Penter Street which was infected till the end of February when voluntary evacuation put a stop to it. In February, 5 & 7, Belvedere Road, Anjirwadi, 31 and 55, De Lima Street, 44, Nowgar village, 18 and 19, Nawab's Tank Road, No. 20, Nawland Street, Ghorupdev, Tank Bunder Huts, Coliwada, Ambewadi, Haji Cassum's Chawls until the beginning of April. 29 and 33, Church Street, Mazagon, Goanese Clubs were very bad. Infection is picked up everywhere and brought to these "clubs." Several cases were traced and disinfected. Most of these people are bakers, tailors, fitters, and waiters in hotels. Towards the end of March, Plague broke out severely in Narielwadi village, and there were 35 deaths amongst 23 small houses and six sheds. Famine immigrants scarcely affected this ward as there was nothing to attract them. Towards the latter part of the epidemic the disease appeared to return and attack Matar- pakhadi village particularly, which till quite lately was red-hot with cases. Rats.-Dead rats were forwarded frequently to Parel Laboratory, alive when possible. They were first noticed in 14, Belvedere Road about the 28th of September 1900, and on examination found full of bacilli. Following were the noteworthy cases of houses escaping- after dead rats appeared-apparently due to disinfection:- No. 9, Muzawarpakhadi Cross Lane, Mr. Head's bungalow.-Dead  rats were found several times supposed to have come from B. 1. S. N. Co.'s store-house.    It was partially disinfected first time, and afterwards completely disinfected. Since then   no dead rats or cases of plague have occurred.
22 Mr. Mackenzie's house, Byculla Saw Mills, in Victoria Road.-Dead rats found at intervals in servants' quarters. Buildings were disinfected three times, and whitewashed. Rat holes were stopped with perchloride of lime at owner's expense. No case of Plague occurred. Mr. Anderson's house, Port Trust Works.-Dead rats were found in servants' quarters and kitchen. All the household were inoculated by Dr. Lamb, and the house disinfected. No case has occurred. P. & O. Workshops.-Dead rats were frequently found full of Plague bacilli. Stores were emptied and the building being very large, a donkey-engine was borrowed from the Health Department to get the building completely flushed. "Cudda", 43-45, Nesbit Road.-Donkey-engine was again borrowed and the place was thoroughly flushed ; since then no dead rats and no more cases. People were brought to Wari Bunder Camp. E Ward, Byculla. This district may be said to have been never quite free from plague in epidemic proportions. There was an appreciable rise in September in the number of deaths due to plague. The epidemic broke into full force in the month of February which was about six weeks later than in the previous year. In March it was at its climax and attained a height never reached before in any other epidemic, viz., in the week ending 19th March 1901, the total mortality rose to 290. After this there was a rapid decline, but the close of the year found the epidemic still raging. Last year there were roughly 300 attacks and 500 deaths less than in the year under report. The figures for plague attacks and deaths are tabulated below:- WARD-E. (BYCULLA). Section. Population. June 1900. July 1900. August 1900. September 1900. October 1900. November 1900.

23 In the last and the present epidemic, Parel Road and Clare Road have remained singularly free of plague. In fact, those houses which were tenanted by the well-to-do classes were exempt this year as they were last year.  But parts of Haines Road, Gilder Street and Chamar Lane were badly infected, the people here being mostly poor and their dwellings overcrowded. Topawani's Chawl at the extreme end of Parel Road was again the only spot there that was infected, its sanitary defects being well known. Rats.-Rats were found but not to any great extent.  Information concerning them was received from the better classes of the people, and in one case the District Officer has no doubt that infection was conveyed by these creatures.  It should be borne in mind that in the first epidemic considerable numbers of rats used to be seen dead in the grain dealers shops in Haines Road, De Lisle Road and Guzri Bazaar. Communities Attacked.-The District Officer points out that in some instances it would appear that the onus of the introduction of plague lies in the habits of the people and cannot be attributed to their dwellings.  He cites a case in which a new house in Kala Chowki Road, only partly occupied, had three cases in a fortnight in it, the tenants being people of very dirty habits. Beggars.-There was no great influx of famine refugees into this district, probably owing to the fact that there was not much money to be collected.  The Hindoos here are mostly of the poorest classes. F and G Wards, The course of the epidemic in F and G Ward is traced by Captain Boileau as follows:- Course of the Epidemic.-This district may again be said to have never been free from Plague.  The last epidemic left us in May with Dharavi still affected, and 7 cases occurred in Dharavi during the month as also 4 Plague cases in Mahim Bazaar.  In July 2 Plague cases were imported into Mahim from Bombay-one from Dhobi Talao and one from a contact from Arthur Road Hospital. In Sion and Sewri in June there were 4 cases which were no doubt connected with the lingering remains of the last epidemic and nothing more occurred there until September. In Parel ( G Ward, Parel ) there were 25 cases, all the remnants of the last epidemic which did not die out until June 25th. From that date onwards there were practically no cases in July or August, but in September Plague broke out again in 478, DeLisle Road. when between the 12th and 15th there were 7 cases. I disinfected this chawl thoroughly in the old style, cleaned the compound and tile-turned the place.  There has been no further case of plague in the chawl, The infection was brought by rats. After that no further cases occurred in any numbers until in November when between the 29th and 7th December 7 cases occurred in various parts of the District. Dadar, Mahim Bazaar, Lalwadi, Sion and Gopi Tank in Mahim showing how irregular was the course of the disease. Like last year the course of the epidemic could be traced by dying rats this year. The rats seem to have come from the South and stayed in the district, and in the same way as last year they have been chiefly instrumental in disseminating plague for the reason that wherever a crop of cases has occurred on any particular site, there dead rats have invariably been discovered and I shall, I think, be able to prove that rat infection is by far the most dangerous.
24 The epidemic proper may be said to have commenced on the 26th December and from that day onwards there were only 3 days on which I had no report of Plague cases or deaths, F & G, (Parel.)-Infection was brought into F and G Ward (Parel) by rats which most probably migrated from the Southern Districts of the city; as at the outset of the epidemic was characterized by finding plague cases and deaths simultaneously with dead rats, that is, in 604, Parel Road, 51-70 and 72, Curry Road from which the epidemic spread northwards to Suparibag Road, 79-67 and 57, and later still to Parel village, Government House, Mounted Police Lines, Governor's Road, Elphinstone Road. Worli.-The same thing happened in Worli when the epidemic began in Haines Road and Dhobighat, whence it spread northwards up to De Lisle Road and Arthur Road into the north of the section. The disease was chiefly (almost entirely in fact) confined to the lower classes (except in the case of Goanese of which a fair number died), and communities attack- ed may be classed as follows:- 1. Marathas. 2. Mochis. 3. Mohammadans and Perdesis. 4. Parsis and Brahmins. 5. Native Christians. The epidemic proper commenced in Parel in January, increased in February, reached its climax in March and declined in April to May. I cannot see that this section was affected to any appreciable extent by famine-stricken people or vagrant people as this class of people seem to wander through the section towards the heart of the City, and do not stay here in any great numbers. Worli, Mahim and Dharari- The Worli and Mahim sections showed a clean bill of health until October when two imported cases were reported, one from Dhobi Talao to Mori Road No. 565, another from Arthur Road Hospital to Custom Road No. 478, and the first local case occurred in a tailor's shop in Mahim Bazaar. In November 1900 only 3 Plague cases occurred in Mahim Bazaar, and then there was none up to 22nd December when Plague broke out in Purbadevi Road from when it spread all over the section. At the same time the disease attacked Worli. The infection was without doubt from rats which were found in quantities dead and dying. From Worli 1st Pacady it worked its way steadily northwards through 2nd and 3rd Pacady (its coming being regularly heralded by news of dead rats,) until it reached Worli Koliwada where it joined the Purbadevi epidemic. From Purbadevi it spread steadily northwards through Mahim Bazaar on the west and Lady Jamsetji Road on the east until it reached the confines of the district. The disease travelled very slowly and constantly harked back to localities through which it had passed and so slowly did it travel that it has only just in May reached Dharavi. This, however, is not unusual, and I think the year under report is very much the same as other years. The communities chiefly attacked were:- 1. Marwaries, Bunias and Marathas. 2. Panchkalsis and Kolis. 3. Parsis and Goanese. I have very little to report as most people from this section leave their houses and go into the fields when Plague breaks out amongst them. Consequently there is little reinfec- tion of localities. In Sion and Sewri sections, the epidemic started with importations from Poona and Nasik in September, but it was not until February that indigenous cases made their appearance in various parts of the sections. These reached their height in March when the epidemic obtained a firm footing. In April and May the epidemic began to decline but very gradually. Communities Attacked.-The disease appears to have attacked all classes alike, but most severely the lower classes of Hindoos. Unlike other parts of the district the epidemic took no regular course but broke out everywhere, Vincent Road, Matunga, Sewri and Sion and Bhoiwada all producing a large crop of cases at the same time.
?25 Rats.---Dead rats were as usual found, wherever a crop of Plague cases were reported. Wherever evacuation could be carried out it was resorted to with excellent results and (asoccurred in Bhoiwada Cross Road) whenever people were foolish enough to stay at home they suffered very severely for it. Re-infection of Localities.-Chawl No. 332, Bhoivada Road, was the only chawl which was re-infected, the re-infection being from dead rats. In Sion and Sewri there were scarcely any cases of plague amongst famines-stricken or vagrant people, and there was also a marked absence of the Small-pox epidemic which occurred last year in this section.

Bhuleshwar, Khara Talao and 2nd Nagpada sections were on the other hand continually infected. With the exception of Chukla there was a general monsoon recrudescence of plague throughout the district during which time Khara Talao and Bhuleshwar suffered most. The first signs of the epidemic were noticed in cases and deaths occurring in Ali Umar Street and Goghari Mohalla in Bhuleshwar and in Mahomed Khan Pakhadi in Umarkhadi. Mahomed Khan Pakhadi is notorious as the starting point for the epidemic, ever since the commencement of plague in this section.
26 Duncan Road was, perhaps, the part of Khara Talao to be first attacked by the epidemic this year, but this is uncertain as the section was already badly infected. In January 1901 from these localities plague spread rapidly to all parts of the district with the exception of Byculla. By the week ending 20th March the epidemic had reached its worst stage, with a total mortality of 420 deaths in this week. The epidemic in Byculla section which had commenced in the end of February broke out in the fiercest manner possible, and so rapidly, that by the end of March it had attained its culminating point. There was a general decline after March which continued to the close of the year. The figures for plague cases and deaths during the year are tabulated below :- CENTRAL DISTRICT. Sections.

?27 Communities Attacked.-The Mahomedans who comprise by far the larger number of the inhabitants of the Central District were the chief sufferers. They continued in their conservative way to accept disinfec- tion with resignation, to object to go to hospital, and to neglect the use of evacuation as a measure. Large numbers of the poorer classes escaped the epidemic this year. Shoemakers who invariably suffered in previous years escaped to a notice- able extent as they did last year. Probably they owed their immunity to their having been inoculated last year. The Jews were also singularly immune this year as they were in pre- vious years. Rats.-The District Officer, Captain Bolton gives his experience about rats as follows:- In Mahomedan quarters there is a difficulty in tracing the origin of dead rats. The Mahomedan unlike the Hindoo will destroy rats himself, or, if he finds dead ones, will throw them to the sweeper and not bother his head any more about them, and it is only by cross-questioning him, that he will remember that a rat was found. Many rats were sent from this district to the Government Laboratory, Parel, for examination. Many instances can be given by which infection was traced to rats. The circumstances in every case were carefully enquired into. On the gang finding rats, they were sent for examination to the Parel Laboratory, the house register was examined to see the state of the house, the people were questioned, and after a careful examination of each case, I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that houses were, in the first instance, infected by rats. Infected Places.-Captain Bolton reports on the way in which certain houses were repeatedly infected despite disinfection as follows:- Of the places disinfected in this district only 21/2 per cent. became re-infected,-a very small proportion. I have found re-infection to be due to rats.  I give two excellent examples. First, 104, Tank Street top floor-Plague kept recurring on this floor, in spite of all our efforts to stop it. The measures as ordered for disinfection in the Government Resolution were strictly carried out. At first I put the re-infection down to the faulty work of the gang, and they had a bad time of it, but after Dr. Fraser and I had personally inspected the work we decided the re-infection must be due to some other cause. The disinfection had been done as high as the hand could reach, in consequence the ceiling had not been touched. Over the flat was a loft which "Dr. Fraser and I decided to inspect. The landlord who was as keen as ourselves, soon opened up a way for us. After our inspection we decided to disinfect the loft, it was a large and difficult undertaking, but it had to be done, and Dr. Fraser, Mr. Guider and myself started on the work with all the available gangs we could get hold of. Such was the state of this loft which had not apparently been visited for many years, with decayed matter, dead rats, &e., that many of the gang men who had taken part in the work, were the next day reported sick with fever. There had been 9 cases of plague on this floor. After the disinfection of the loft no more cases occurred. Second, this was house No. 37-38, Mahomed Khan Pakadi. Plague had occurred and the house had become re-infected. Dr. Fraser and myself went on an inspection of the house. On the top floor under the roof at each end of the staircase, were two closets, filled with building material and rubbish. Although a difficult job we decided to disinfect them. The house has been free since. We found dead rats in the closets, which were without doubt the cause of the re-infection, as, after the disinfection no plague case has occurred in the house. Re-infection has also been traced to bogus isolation and importation from outside.
28 Famine Refugees.-This district was very full of these refugees, and, no doubt, they helped to swell the mortality as also to spread infec- tion.  The houses in which they lived were few, but they rented them by mutual subscription and plague attacked them to a grievous extent. Capt. Bolton states as follows:- From June 1900 to September 1900 this district was full of famine-stricken people mostly people from Kathiawar, but those I have met come from all parts of India, After the rains many left Bombay. A number. however, remained and during the month of Ramzan thousands were to be seen outside the various mosques begging. It is a curious fact, and unlike last year, these wanderers did not suffer very severely from plague. The district is still full of these people who go from mosque to mosque for their daily rations. The Mahomedan Memon in his own way is very charitable, and many beggars find it easier work to go to the mosques for food than to return to their country to work at hard labour in the fields. Review of the public Health and course of the Epidemic during the year. JUNE. In June 1900, whilst plague in its epidemic form was diminishing, small-pox had almost disappeared, but cholera, which proved afterwards to be of a very virulent type, had already caused a few deaths here and there in different parts of the City. It made its first appearance in the Fort, Mandvi, Kamatipura and Worli, and sporadic cases were not long in cropping up in other parts of the city and island. By the end of the month Dongri, most of C. Ward, each section of the Wari Bunder District, Byculla, and Central Dis- trict, had each of them a few cases of cholera. The total mortality figures at this time in the Umarkhadi and Bhuleshwar sections continued high, when the mortality of other sections of the city diminished. JULY. Passing on to July the deaths among famine immigrants continued to occur in the Fort, but lessened in number towards the end of the month. There was a small number of deaths from relapsing fever in F and G Wards. Plague at the opening of the month had given signs of a steady decadence and cholera was increasing in every ward. But in the second week cholera had become epidemic in A Ward, B North, C Ward, D Ward, Wari Bunder, and F and G Wards which last was the worse attacked, whilst Plague was reported to have all but disappeared from it. During the third week plague all over the City had still further diminished, but a choleraic form of plague was in many instances found and reported. Meanwhile measures had been taken to give free medicine to those attacked by Cholera. The medicine used was Dr. Leith's Cholera Mix- ture, of two kinds-with and without opium. The reports received from District Officers show that this mixture was efficacious, especially when taken in the early stages of the attack.
29 By the end of July the total mortality had increased from about 1,000 to 1,500 for the week ending the 25th July. Most of this increase was reported as due to cholera, as indeed it must have been, for, small- pox had disappeared, relapsing fever was almost nil except in Byculla, and plague cases and deaths numbered 442 for the whole month. But it must be remembered that a very large proportion of the deaths were verified by enquiry, and in Wari Bunder after deducting 65 deaths due to cholera, there were 200 per cent. of the deaths stated to be due to ordinary causes which were in excess of the normal mortality of the district. There was also at this time a very heavy mortality amongst infants in the Central District. The places most severely attacked by Cholera were Worli, Ghorup- deo, Dongri, Kumbharwada and Victoria Bunder Chawls in Colaba. AUGUST. The first week in August found Plague stationary with a small diminution in the mortality from cholera. But it was well known that there was considerable concealment of Plague; suffering cases were found only in a few instances. On the other hand cholera had increased in Wari Bunder and F and G Wards. The newspapers at this time criticised the new plague measures which were about to be introduced, and there was considerable discussion of them among the people also. The infant mortality continued to be high.  Mothers were through stress of the times unable to look after and nourish their children, and there were large numbers of beggars especially in the Fort, who died and were reported as roadside deaths from Plague, Cholera, and other causes. The mortality attributed to ordinary causes was very largely in excess of the normal figures. By the third week, mortality amongst rats had been reported from A Ward, Byculla and C Ward. There was as usual a distinct rise in plague which was reported from most quarters of the City. Cholera, however, was stationary except in C Ward and the Central district where there was a large increase. Plague and cholera were often found in the same place. There were two instances in the Fort where plague and cholera cases were taken out of the same house on the same day. There was an extraordinary increase at this time in the number of medical certificates given by private practitioners as it was becoming known that the new measures were not of a compulsory nature. In the week ending the 21st there was an appalling rise in the mortality, the total deaths from all causes numbering 2,200.  Dead rats were found in large numbers in A Ward and E Ward West, and cholera was at its worst in C and F and G Wards. 8
30 The rains had been very heavy and the usual monsoon recrudescence of Plague appeared to be at hand. In the final week, however, the weather changed and there was a rapid improvement; the total mortality figure fell to about 1,600. SEPTEMBER. The first two weeks in September witnessed a great and continued decline in the deaths from Cholera, especially in C, D, and F and G Wards. The last two weeks, however, found Plague on the increase when the monsoon recrudescence reached its height; whilst cholera showed signs of dying out altogether. The increase in plague was accompanied with the usual discovery of a mortality among rats, especially in E Ward West, where there was a decided rise in the mortality from plague. Meanwhile there were rumours of numbers of dead rats being found in C Ward; whilst the District Officer in F and G Wards reported that many people from the city were moving into camps in his district. The new Plague measures were received with signs of approval by the people, whilst the work of verification and disinfection met with closer attention from the Plague staff. OCTOBER. The month of October was characterised by a steady weekly dimi- nution in the mortality from cholera as well as plague. By the end of the month cholera practically disappeared. Plague, however, main- tained its hold, and reports were received of a considerable number of imported cases, especially from Poona. The new rules were working well and in great favour with the people. The number of suffering cases brought to light was increasing. Medical practitioners were beginning to report cases of plague as well as other sickness. A considerable number of roadside cases were met with, There was no doubt that the famine refugees and those out of work were very hard pressed, with the result that the Grant Road Hospital was opened for them. Disinfection met with still greater attention from the District Offi- cers who improved matters in this line, with good results. NOVEMBER. The month of November opened with signs of an abatement of the dire ills which had so long played havoc amongst the people. Cholera had vanished and Plague was reduced to a total for the month of 547 cases and deaths as compared with 964 the total for September when the recrudescence occurred.
31 The total mortality was reduced to the lowest figure yet reached during the past six months (vide chart). The weekly fluctuations in the mortality of the different districts were slight, and on the whole there was neither any appreciable increase nor decrease up to the end of the month either in Plague or in the total motality. Dead rats were found to a small extent in A Ward and B Ward South. In view of a probable advent of the epidemic the people were ap- proached to get themselves inoculated, but since no money was now to be given to those who got themselves inoculated the people would not take to it. The child mortality still kept high, as also did the sickness among beggars. DECEMBER. The first two weeks in December showed an almost imperceptible rise in the total mortality, which, however, was distinctly appreciable in the latter half of the month, and left little doubt that a fresh epidemic was imminent. Here then it may be said commenced the epidemic under report. It started about five weeks later than the previous epidemic judging from the total Mortality Chart. Mortality amongst rats was reported in each succeeding week of the month in A Ward. During the last three weeks in C Ward and E Ward West, there was a noticeable rise in the mortality. In the last two weeks rats were reported in the Central District with a corresponding rise in Plague mortality. The nights were very cold at this time, and in the early part of the month there was a heavy mortality amongst beggars in the Fort and Central District, where they used to be found dead on the roadside. JANUARY. During the Month of January there was a rapid increase in the epi- demic, which fairly pervaded every district. In the first half of the month C Ward, B Ward North and especially A Ward were the worst attacked. The number of cases suffering from plague remaining at home increased very considerably. Reports of attendants on patients being attacked came in from A Ward, B Ward South and C Ward. Rats were found dying in large numbers, and wherever they were discovered Plague was observed to attack the people also. By the end of the month C Ward, Central District, E Ward West and D Ward were still further attacked. The disinfection work had increased very considerably; the want of Staff Corps Officers and English doctors to supervise disinfection was keenly felt owing to the increase in the disinfection staff. In C Ward a coolie employed in disinfecting a room was caught stealing and was arrested, tried, convicted and sentanced to 4 months' rigorous imprisonment. The necessity for European supervision was made very apparent in other ways in disinfection work.
32 During the last week in the month a few Europeans were attacked in Colaba Causeway, and infection was said to be traced to rats, which were found here. There was no doubt that the epidemic was gathering in force. From the middle of December when the epidemic may be said to have started to the end of January, the total weekly mortality had risen from 800 to 1,400, and everything pointed to a severe visitation. For the month of January the total number of cases and deaths discovered in the city was 1,996. FEBRUARY. By February Plague had reached all parts of the city in full epidemic proportions. There was a terrible increase in the mortality from week to week, and this was particularly noticeable in C Ward, E Ward West, Mandvi, and in the last week in D Ward. In all the other districts infection was slowly spreading at first, but every week showed an increase in the number of deaths. Wari Bunder, Byculla and F and G Wards were the most healthy in comparison at this time, but there were unmis- takable signs of the progress of infection into these parts of the island. The mortality rising steadily showed a vast increase from 1,400 in the last week of the previous month to 2,500 by the fourth week of February. MARCH. By the end of February the total number of cases and deaths had risen to 5,119 and by the beginning of March the epidemic had reached its height. The mortality from all causes including plague for the week ending March 5th was just a trifle over 2,600 deaths. The epidemic of the previous year attained its zenith in the last week of February, the deaths numbering about 200 more than in the epidemic under report, considering the abnormal conditions prevailing at the time of the epidemic of 1899-1900, due to famine and the mills being closed, the epidemic under review was not influenced to nearly the same extent, so there seems little doubt that the epidemic of 1900 and 1901 comparatively, was the most severe yet experienced in Bombay. The second week of March found B Ward South suffering such as it had never suffered before from plague; whilst Wari Bunder and espe- cially Byculla and F and G Wards reported a large increase in their mortality returns. The death-rate for the rest of the City showed a wel- come decline. There was a slight check in the fall, however, in the third week, but there was a decrease from 2,500 deaths to 1,950 in the last week. Wari Bunder, Byculla and F and G Wards were having their share of the epidemic at this time, and by the end of the month it was seen that it was moving to the northern extremities of the island and with the exception of Byculla the city was undoubtedly becoming relieved of the worst of the epidemic. The total number of Plague cases and deaths for the month of March were 8,232.
33 APRIL. The month of April commenced with signs of Plague refusing to die an easy death. There was a recrudescence in A and C Wards fol- lowed by Byculla, and by the second week a revival of infection in C Ward, B Ward South, E West and Wari Bunder. The exceptionally hot and vapourous weather at this time was said to be the cause of this rivivication of Plague. The mortality showed a decline by the end of April when the total number of Plague cases and deaths for this month were 3,922. The village of Narielwadi was very severely attacked, and its inhabit- ants, mostly Mahomedans, neglected to evacuate their dwellings although Captain Moore, the District Officer, used every effort to persuade them to go to the Camp at Wari Bunder. Appalled at the rapid death-rate among them, they finally asked for a camp to be made especially, for them at the last moment, but before this could be done the violence of the epidemic had died out. MAY. The decline continued throughout the month of May, but was more gradual. In the first week there was a recurrence of the moist heat which produced effects corresponding to those already reported in the month of April. The increase in the mortality was noticeable in B and C Wards, Wari Bunder and E Ward West-the same localities as in the previous instance. By the last week in May the total mortality had fallen to 1,000, whilst the total number of Plague cases and deaths reported for the whole month were 2,060, showing that though on the decline the epidemic continued to rage to the end of the year under report.
CHAPTER III. MEASURES ADOPTED. New measures for the prevention and suppression of Plague were introduced into Bombay City late in September 1900. They were based upon the Report of the Indian Plague Commission and the Government of India Resolution dated 16th July 1900. The Resolution contained a review of the proposals and measures recommended in the Plague Commission Report, dictated the policy to be pursued towards the people affected by outbreaks of Plague and in- dicated the methods to be employed and measures to be adopted in future Plague administration. The following summary of orders was accordingly issued as being specially applicable to the people of Bombay City. Government con- curred in the views which found expression in these orders and agreed to provide as a minimum staff thirteen Staff Corps officers and five English doctors, to carry them out. Summary of the Orders of Government on Chapters VI, VI-A and VI-B, VI-C and VI-D of the Report of the Indian Plague Commission dealing with measures for the suppression of Plague compiled for the guidance of Officers on Plague Duty in Bombay City. [ Vide Government of India Resolution No. 1789-1804, in the Home Department, Sanitary (Plague), dated 16th July 1900, and Bombay Government Resolution, General Department (Plague), No. 4677-P, dated 1st August 1900.] Introductory-Paragraphs 1 to 6. The high case mortality in plague, combined with the longer continuance of an outbreak, makes it a disease more to be dreaded than cholera in a locality where it has established itself. In India various measures, some successful, some unsuccessful, have been tried, and most absurd rumours as to the objects of Government have obtained currency among the people. These misapprehensions, and the universal experience that the people of infected places can and will evade measures for dealing with plague which are distasteful to them, have established it as an axiom that it is hopeless to carry out any system of plague administration which runs counter to the feelings, susceptibilities and prejudices of the people. The Commission there- fore observe that measures which press with severity upon the inhabitants of an infected place, as a whole, or on the friends and relatives of the patient as dis- tinguished from the patient himself, can never be enforced in the case of a wide- spread epidemic by the staff available in India. Coercion is not a practical policy, but much can be done by persuasion and practical demonstration of the utility of certain measures.
35 Fatalism is with an Oriental a formidable obstacle to the recognition of the utility of any plague measures, but it can be and is overcome. What he does resent, and bitterly, is to be obliged to submit to measures, the use of which he does not understand, and of which he is naturally suspicious. It is most essential to prepare the people before an outbreak by telling them as far as possible what measures they will be required to submit to. In the opinion of the Government of India much may be done by a strong, sympathetic and respected District Officer to remove doubts and suspicions and to secure the co-operation of the leaders of the people. If the popular leaders are hostile or indifferent, the task of convincing the ignorant and suspicious masses will be hopeless. Experience has made it clear that the first principle of all plague measures is to eschew compulsion, except in extra- ordinary circumstances, and the efforts of Government officials should be directed to convincing the people of the utility of particular methods, and to inducing them to carry them out not by force but by exercise of their own free will, and as a conse- quence of their appreciating and understanding the benefits to be anticipated therefrom. Methods of Discovering Cases of Plague during Life. Paragraphs 7 to 15. Government agree with the Commission that the compulsory notification of sickness can only be relied on in the very exceptional cases where the medical establishments employed are sufficient to take advantage of it, and where the obligation to report can be efficiently enforced. Regarding the system of house visitation and house search which has now fallen into general disuse, the strong hostility to it leads the Commission to conclude that with a very strong establishment and with a very limited amount of infection to deal with such a system may result in the detection of nearly every case of plague, and that when such conditions exist the advantages of house searches may possibly more than counterbalance the objections to them. But these conditions will be rarely found, and in other conditions house-to-house searches will be un- productive of good as well as irritating to the people. The Government of India do not absolutely 'prohibit the adoption of this method of endeavouring to discover cases of plague, but consider that it should be employed only when it is clear that it will be effectual in saving the people from disaster, and only when plague exists in small and well defined areas such as an isolated quarter of a town, or a single village in a neighbourhood otherwise completely free from infection. Surveillance over persons arriving from infected areas is essential at places in their neighbourhood or in constant communication with them, but depends for its success upon the active and intelligent co-operation of the people themselves. It is difficult, especially in towns, to maintain an efficient surveillance, but it is one of the most useful means of preventing a healthy place from becoming infected. Government agree with the opinion of the Commission and consider that in towns supplied with special sanitary and medical establishments the duty of supervising the arrangements for surveillance can be entrusted to such establishments, but the actual work of surveillance can best be performed by the people themselves, and the inhabitants of towns and villages threatened with plague should be encouraged and assisted to keep an organized surveillance over persons arriving from infected areas.
36 Government do not regard with much favour the system of granting rewards for information regarding plague cases, but do not altogether prohibit it at the discretion of local Governments. The employment of paid spies and informers should never be adopted. Government fully endorse the view of the Commission that the employment of influential and trustworthy residents of a town to collect information regarding the occurrence of cases of plague must be of material assistance to the authorities. It would be impossible to provide official agencies of sufficient strength in cities like Bombay. Moreover, unless there be an intermediary between the repre- sentative of Government and the people, there is constant danger that the require- ments of the authorities may be misunderstood. The risk of concealment of cases is lessened where people see that the influential residents of the place have ranged themselves on the side of the authorities. Government expect that all adminis- trations will avail themselves of every opportunity of enlisting and utilizing the services of influential and trustworthy gentlemen of the non-official classes in all matters connected with plague administration and particularly in assisting to discover cases of plague. The inspection of villages next referred to does not concern this City. Discovery of Plague after Death.-Paras. 16 to 23. Since it is not possible to find all cases of plague in life, the first object should be to find all cases after death. There is a divergence of opinion in the Commission as to the question of corpse inspection, but they are agreed as to the necessity of the disinfection in towns of every house in which a plague death has occurred. The number of houses in respect of which information will be volunteered judging by past experience will be extremely few. The majority of the Commission propose to discover the remainder by determining that all cases in which the cause of death is not ascertained shall be treated as deaths from plague; the minority propose to ascertain them by requiring every body to be examined. Under both proposals there will be some margin of error. If the proposal of the majority is properly and completely carried out, a certain number of houses in which plague deaths have not occurred will be disinfected; if that of the minority is carried out, a certain number in which plague deaths have occurred will escape disinfection, for it is impossible always to diagnose plague after death. Government agreeing with the majority of the Commission are of opinion that the compulsory examination of dead bodies is a very unpopular measure; that its object is always likely to be defeated by dead bodies being thrown out of houses; and that it could only be effectively carried out, with establishments which it would be impossible to provide, and that even if every dead body were examined this would afford no greater security that every house in which a plague death has occurred would be disinfected, then a system of assuming that every death, the cause of which cannot be established, was due to plague and requiring the house in which it occurred to be disinfected. Government approve of the daily scrutiny of the returns from burning ghauts and burial grounds by strong staffs appointed to different sections of a town who make a careful and patient enquiry into all deaths considered in any way open to suspicion. They direct that compulsory corpse inspection shall not be utilized again in any part of India. The object which it is designed to attain will be effected by treating   during  an   outbreak   of  plague in towns all deaths, the cause of which
37 cannot be determined not to be plague, as deaths from plague and by disinfecting the houses in which they occur. It will of course be open to any persons to volun- tarily submit a dead body to the examination of a medical officer if they wish to avoid the death being treated as due to plague. Applying the principles here laid down to Bombay we find that compulsory notification of sickness has never been enforced, though under the ordinary provisions of the Municipal Act medical practitioners have been and will continue to be bound to report plague or any other dangerous disease which may come to their knowledge. Official house-to-house visitation was long ago discontinued and will not be resumed, though it will continue to be the duty of the staff to visit houses that have been infected with a view to keeping the inmates under observation. The question of surveillance over arrivals from infected areas is hardly applicable to Bombay under present conditions and would be exceedingly difficult to carry into practice. Paid spies and informers are not now employed and must not be employed, nor should rewards be granted for information regarding plague cases unless and until that is sanctioned by the local Government. Every effort should be made to secure the co-operation and assistance of volunteers in collecting information of plague cases which they will continue to do, as now, by making enquiries in localities where they are known and have influence. They will also continue to be of the utmost value in explaining to the people the utility of the measures adopted, and helping to get them carried out without friction. It is recognised that it is not possible to find all cases of plague during life. Compulsory examination of dead bodies has never been adopted in Bombay and is prohibited, but the verification of deaths should continue on the same lines as heretofore; and it should be very distinctly understood and explained to the people that all deaths, the cause of which cannot be determined not to be plague, will be treated as deaths from plague and the house wherein it occurred disinfected accordingly. Still-born deaths from ordinary causes in hospital, deaths certified not to be due to plague by reliable medical practitioners, are not open to suspicion; the people should be encouraged to inform the plague staff of any dangerous illness so that the Sectional Medical Officers may satisfy themselves whether the disease is plague, and in the last resort it will always be possible for the people to avoid disinfection where the death is not due to plague by submitting the dead body for examination. The test whether the District Staff are carrying out these principles efficiently will be found under ordinary conditions in comparing the balance of deaths ascribed to ordinary causes with the normal mortality of the District. Removal of Plague Patients to Hospital.-Paras. 24 to 27. The Commission are of opinion that the strong aversion of the people to hospital leads to the concealment of cases and in Bombay to the removal of the plague-stricken from house to house. They do not think that any steps taken to popularize hospitals will materially affect the attitude of the people, and they consider that the concealment of cases and their secret removal from house to house increase not only the number of houses infected but also the uncertainty as to which houses were actually infected; on the other hand the policy of permitting the sick to be treated in their own houses, as in Calcutta and Mysore City, did not lead to violent outbreaks of plague. 10
38 In dealing with imported cases or early indigenous cases compulsory removal might be advisable, but where the authorities are unable to get the bulk of the cases, the less the sick are interfered with the better. The continual visitation of the sick at home, frequent disinfection of the infected room, and the encouragement of inoculation among the persons left in the houses with the sick, are the points which should be aimed at. Government lay down that the removal of patients to hospital should be com- pulsory only in places and under circumstances where it can be carried out so completely as to render it an effectual precaution, and in the case of persons who are left without any one to look after them, or who have no home: but every effort should be made to induce patients to go voluntarily to hospital, and to lessen the aversion to hospitals by the means enumerated by the Commission. Govern- ment renew their prohibition of the removal of moribund patients. In Bombay there can be no question that the bulk of suffering cases escape detection and the removal of the sick is not an effectual precaution. Removal of the sick will therefore not be compulsory in Bombay, but it will be the business of District Officers and Sectional Medical Officers to do their best to induce patients to go voluntarily to hospital and if, as will generally be the case at any rate for the present, they are unsuccessful, it will be their duty to arrange for the daily visitation of the sick person at home, the frequent disinfection of the infected room, and the encouragement of inoculation among the other inmates of the house. Every effort should also be made to secure isolation of the sick person as far as possible: the disinfection and removal of all superfluous kit: and where the patient has no medical attendant, the Sectional Medical Officer should do his best to save his life by advising and prescribing for him. Patients, who are left without anyone to look after them or who have no home, should be removed to hospital. The removal of moribund cases is again prohibited. Segregation of Contacts.-Paras. 28 to 30. The Commission are of opinion that the figures placed before them do not justify the conclusion that contacts must be regarded from the point of view of the protection of the rest of the community as so dangerous that they ought to be compulsorily removed to a Segregation Camp, and though under very special circumstances the segregation of contacts might be a measure of very great value, it can in urban areas, where infection is widespread, be easily evaded, and has as a matter of fact been quite ineffective for the protection of the community. Government agree with these views and add that if a system of surveillance can be devised which will enable a watch to be kept over the health of contacts without exciting them to evade observation, it will be advantageous, but no such measure will be effective in a large town unless it is carried on with the co-operation of the inhabitants. In Bombay, therefore, all attempt at the segregation of contacts is to be abandoned, but when a case occurs in a house District Officers and Sectional Medical Officers should, with the assistance of volunteers, endeavour to keep an eye upon the health of the other inmates until the likelihood of their develop- ing the disease has passed away, and this should be done in a kindly way, so as to avoid frightening them. Evacuation.-Paras. 31 to 35. In applying the general principles here laid down to Bombay, it may be re- marked in the first place that evacuation on a large scale as contemplated in these paras, is regarded as out of the question in this City (para. 33).
39 Evacuation of the character that has been carried out here during the past 3 years is not discussed, but the remarks made at the conclusion of para. 35 are equally applicable to small areas and large. Experience points to the advisability of agitating the people of a large place as little as possible when infection is widely distributed among the inhabitants so as not to drive them away. Anything drastic in the way of evacuation would undoubtedly agitate the people of Bombay, but with few exceptions evacuation on the lines adopted here has not been greatly objected to, and the private camps along the Kennedy Sea Face, Cruikshank Road, and in F and G Wards bear ample testimony to the appreciation by the more enlightened of the value of eva- cuation. Every encouragement will, therefore, continue to be given to various communities to erect such camps when plague threatens: and as in the past Municipal Camps will be erected when thought desirable in F and G Wards for the accommodation there of those too poor to build their own camps. In these cases, however, the inmates of such camps occupy them during practical- ly the whole period of an epidemic, and they stand on an entirely different footing to the persons who have been evicted in other parts of Bombay and sent for a brief space to health camps. Conditions of space render it absolutely impossible to provide accommodation for lengthened periods for the residents of most parts of the City, and the only advantage they can hope to be gained by their temporary ac- commodation is a temporary freedom from liability to attack owing to their absence for a time from the infected area, coupled with a hope of future immunity owing to the disinfection of that area. Some officers have a high opinion of the value of such temporary evacuation while others point out that plague often breaks out again in chawls that have been temporarily cleared out in this way. The conclusions of the Commission indicate that so brief a period of vacancy as 10 days could not be relied upon for the destruction of infection in a chawl by the ordinary processes of nature, and the inference is that if infection has been destroyed during the 10 days, it has been done by the chemical disinfection which invariably accompanies such evacuation. Now the action of a chemical disinfectant is rapid, and the conclusion is that all the advantages secured by disinfection coupled with 10 days in a health camp would be equally secured by disinfection followed by immediate re-occupation. For these reasons the compulsory evacuation of chawls, &c., for a period of 10 days should now cease, and should be replaced by rigorous disinfection in cases where evacuation would formerly have been resorted to. If in consequence of the inconvenience and dampness attendant upon disin- fection the inmates desire to go to camp for a day or two, they may be permitted to do so, but ordinarily the simplest way to deal with a large chawl would be to take one floor at a time, the people of the floor under treatment finding temporary accommodation on the other floors during the process. Compulsory evacuation should not be resorted to without the express sanction of this office, and District Officers must understand that if complaints of compulsory evacuation are made it will be impossible to support their action. Disinfection.-Paras. 36 to 39. The section of the report of the Indian Plague Commission, dealing with the subject of disinfection is of very great importance, and should be carefully studied by all Plague Officers. The conclusion of the majority of the Commissioners which is accepted by Government is that where skilled and efficient control was exercised chemical disinfection exercised a preponderating influence in destroying infection.
40 On the other hand it has often not been carried out in a way to secure the best results. Imperfect disinfection invokes waste of energy and material, brings discredit on the system by exhibiting unsuccessful results, and invokes a false sense of security with regard to localities which have been incompletely disinfected, and still contain the living germs of plague. 1. The Commission lay down the necessity for employing a strong and capable supervising staff, and consider that the officer in charge of disinfecting operations should possess an elementary knowledge of the chemical and other disinfecting agencies employed. 2. They think the actual burning down of houses should only be resorted to in the case of temporary structures of little or no value, or in the case of houses which are unfit for human habitation. They condemn the practice of digging up floors with a view to kiln burning them owing to the risk of infection from the dust, and they consider the complete unroofing of houses a needlessly drastic measure. Chemical disinfection ought they think to be resorted to wherever possible. Of all measures of disinfection it is the only one which, when effectively carried out, immediately destroys the infective material present in a room, and renders the room at once practically safe for re-occupation. It must, however, be carefully borne in mind, that a disinfected room, though it has been rendered fit for imme- diate re-occupation, is liable to be reinfected by the agency of rats or men. 3. They recommend that disinfection operations should in towns be restricted to the actual houses in which either plague cases have occurred or dead rats have been found: where dead rats have not been found they are of opinion that, in the case of houses containing a number of unconnected families, only the room or rooms which have been occupied by plague patients should be disinfected; while in the case of houses containing only one family, disinfection should be applied to the whole house. They recommend that the disinfectant should be applied in ordinary cases only to the floors and so much of the walls as is in reach of the disinfectors, and to all recesses and places which might have served for the reception of infected clothing. They think it unnecessary to take any measures with regard to the upper parts of walls or to the ceilings and roofs and remark that the impossibility of compassing by artificial means the devitalization of every plague bacillus, and the expediency of committing that devitalisation in all cases where it is safe to do so to the disinfecting agencies of nature, are considerations which ought to be constantly present in the mind of the disinfector. 4. They provisionally recommend an acid solution of perchloride of mercury of a strength of 1 in 1,000, but think that further experiments on the subject of the cheapest and best disinfectant are desirable. 5. They think that a concentrated solution of the disinfectant in acid should be made up by some responsible authority. Clear instructions should be issued as to the quantity of water to be added, and glasses and buckets of a standard size should be used for its dilution. Instead of pumping or throwing the disinfectant over the walls, it should be poured over the floors, and the walls should be vigor- ously brushed down with it, as otherwise it is likely to run rapidly off smooth or greasy walls without effecting their disinfection. Before beginning disinfection, the household effects and furniture should be cleared out and placed in the open. The room itself should be dealt with and then the effects taken in hand. As soon
41 as they are finished they should be replaced, and as soon as the rooms are dry, the inmates should be allowed to return. It is unnecessary to whitewash the rooms or to keep them subsequently vacant. 6. The recommendations contained in their 6th para. do not apply to Bombay City. 7. The aversion of the people towards disinfection of their effects and their practice of secreting or removing clothes, &c., in order to avoid it, have often resulted in the spread of infection. It is therefore of the utmost importance to consult the feelings of the people as much as possible. It is of little use to give compensation for goods destroyed; and the difficulty should be met by proscrib- ing all destructive methods of disinfection: in particular nothing which could by any possibility have any value for its owner should be broken up or destroy- ed by fire. 8. As regards the disinfection of the clothing and effects found in an infected room, the Commission recommend either momentary immersion in boiling water, or steeping in a disinfecting solution. They point out that an acid solution of perchloride of mercury would be injurious to clothing, and if this disinfectant was used a neutral solution would have to be made up as well as the acid solution. Complications of this nature, however, lead to error and confusion unless the work is carried out under the immediate supervision of trustworthy Europeans. 9. The Commission do not recommend the procedure of conveying clothes to a steam sterilizer, because in India it is difficult to secure that intelligent and perfectly trustworthy supervision which is essential for this form of disinfec- tion. 10. With regard to valuable silks and other articles likely to be injured by other form of disinfection, the Commission recommend a prolonged exposure for several days to the direct rays of the sun. 11. Stocks of corn, which may have become infected through the agency of rats, they recommend should be spread out in a thin layer in the sun. 12. This recommendation does not concern Bombay City. 13. The disinfection of drains and cesspits they consider unnecessary as filth disinfects itself by ordinary processes of nature. The case of latrines is different, because there infection might be spread before these processes had time to operate: latrines should therefore continue to be disinfected. The Government of India strongly commend the advice of the Commission summarized above. They call for reports regarding the better training of the disinfecting staff. They support the opinion of the majority of the Commission, that chemical disinfection is a far more efficient measure in towns and places where trained disinfectors can be employed, and efficient supervision exercised over the preparation of the disinfectant and its application. They direct the continuance of experiments as to the cheapest and best disinfectant and draw very particular attention to number 6 of the above recommendations regarding measures which may be taken to lessen the objections of the people to the disinfection of their effects. With regard to number 3 of the above suggestions, however, Government observe that the practice in Calcutta tends to show the advantages of disinfecting not only the house or room actually infected, but also houses adjoining infected ones: and Government are therefore unable to agree with the view that disinfection should be restricted to the houses in which either plague cases have occurred or dead rats have been found. 11
42 The following orders are issued for disinfection operations in Bombay:- Ordinarily in the case of houses containing a number of unconnected families only the room or rooms which have been occupied by plague patients should be disinfected, while in case of houses containing only one family disinfection should be applied to the whole house. When a number of cases occur at short intervals in a house the District Officer will disinfect the whole house or whole floor as may seem necessary, and he will have authority, if he deems it desirable, to disinfect not only the house or room in which either plague cases have occurred, or dead rats have been found, but also adjoining houses or rooms. It is a most important part of a District Officer's duty to guide and supervise his Sectional Medical Officers in deciding what rooms and floors and houses are to be disinfected. The following detailed rules should be observed:- 1. It is of the utmost importance that disinfection should be prompt and thorough. District Officers should therefore see that every gang works under the supervision of an intelligent and trustworthy sub-inspector. He should have a clear idea of the utility of what he is doing, and the District Officer should regularly and carefully supervise his work. It should be the aim of the District Officer to have a gang at work as soon as the disinfec- tion of a place is decided to be necessary. 2. It is of the utmost importance to overcome the aversion of the people to disinfec- tion, and their tendency to remove or secrete their belongings, which is calculated to defeat the objects of disinfection. This can only be done by explaining to them the utility of the measure and consulting their feelings as much as possible. In particular nothing which could by any possibility have any value for its owner should be broken up or destroyed by fire, and the greatest care should be taken to avoid all unnecessary damage. 3. To reduce the inconvenience to the people as much as possible the whole process of disinfection should be carried out at one and the same time and not extended over two days as at present. 4. To avoid hurting the feelings of the people, care should be taken that the disin- fecting gangs are of such caste as will not be objected to by the people among whom they work. 5. In disinfecting a room, first the furniture and effects should be taken out and placed in the open. The room should then be disinfected with the solution of perchloride of mercury. The solution should be poured over the floor, and the walls and ceiling should be thoroughly scrubbed with a brush soaked in the solution. It is not necessary to disinfect any part of the walls or ceiling which are not within reach but all recesses and places which might have served for the reception of infected clothing should be carefully disinfected. Every care should be taken to avoid raising dust during disinfection. 6. Where a steam sterilizer is within easy reach the clothing and household effects should be sent to it for disinfection. But articles, such as boxes or furniture, which cannot be conveniently sterilised in this way, or articles of leather which would be damaged in a steam sterilizer, should be disinfected on the spot with a strong solution of phenyle; and all the effects should be treated in this way if a steam sterilizer is not within easy reach. The solution of perchloride of mercury should not be used for disinfecting clothing, &c., as it is an acid solution and would cause damage. 7. Valuable silks and other articles likely to be injured by other forms of disinfection should be exposed for several days to the direct rays of the sun. Similarly if it is necessary to disinfect stocks of corn, which may have become infected through the agency of rats, they should be spread out in a thin layer in the sun. 8. As soon as the room is disinfected and the furniture, &c., has been dealt with the furniture and effects should be replaced in the room. As soon as the room is dry the inmates should be allowed to return; it is unnecessary to whitewash the room or keep it subsequent- ly vacant.
43 9. Nahanis and the privy-seats of latrines used by the inmates of the rooms disinfected should be carefully cleaned and flushed with the solution of perchloride of mercury. 10. The roofs and walls of houses should not be opened, and floors should not be dug up. 11. A 10 per cent. solution of perchloride of mercury is supplied to the District Officer from the Foras Road laboratory. Each District Officer is provided with measuring glasses containing 6 oz. and with wooden tubs containing when nearly full 380oz. The perchloride solution is intended to be used of a strength of 1 in 760. Five ounces of this 1 in 10 solution contain 1/2 oz. perchloride of mercury and this when made up to 380 oz. with water gives the strength required. In order to give a margin for errors the glasses supplied for measuring have a capacity of 6 oz. but as in practice they are never quite filled approximate- ly 5 oz. are added to each tub of water. Similarly the solution of phenyle should be prepared by adding one glass of phenyle to one tub of water, the glasses and tubs being of the same size as stated above. Government agree with the majority of the Commission that the opening up of the roofs and walls of masonry houses is seldom necessary: when the dwellings are huts of a comparatively poor character, the removal of portions of the roofs can be done with no structural injury and at small cost, and it will be a prudent precaution to unroof such huts and to induce the people to remain away from them for at least 2 months until the process of desiccation is complete. In towns chemical disinfection by trained disinfectors is a far more efficient measure. The Commission point out that Laboratory experiments and practical experi- ence alike tend to show that little danger is to be apprehended of the spread of plague by ordinary articles of merchandize. The only precaution which could be taken would be to insist upon its being thoroughly dry, and this is a point to which merchants themselves attend in their own interests. The Commission are, there- fore, of opinion, and Government agree that it is neither advisable nor necessary to take any steps towards the disinfection of ordinary merchandise. In view of these general recommendations the accompanying instructions for disinfection are laid down in modification of those now in force and printed at pages 55 and 56 of the Municipal Commissioner's plague report for the year ending 31st May 1899. Paras. 40 to 54 dealing with Railway and Sea Inspection and the like do not concern the internal administration of this city. Paras. 55 to 59 contain a recapitulation of points already noticed and a discussion of the principles to be applied in dealing with the varying conditions of different places. Government lay it down that the extent to which measures can be effectively and thoroughly carried out will depend to a great extent upon the tact and influence of the Government officials charged with this duty. No one among the many duties which a District Officer is called on to perform in this country affords greater scope for attaining success by means of personal influence than that of plague administration. His Excellency in Council entirely agrees with the views recently expressed by the Lieutenant-Governor of the N.-W.P. that any rigid system of plague measures is to be deprecated, and he is the most successful plague administrator who is able to gauge the temper of the particular class of people he is dealing with and to suit the rules to the circumstances of the place. A general system or principle must, indeed, be preserved, but success depends mostly on the patience and dexterity of the officer in charge, and his power over the people.            J. H. DUBOULAY, Bombay, 5th September 1900.                     Deputy  Commissioner,     Plague Operations.
44 These Orders speak for themselves. They require greater care, and patience in investigating the causes of death and lay stress on the results to be expected from chemical disinfection by a specially trained staff. The greatest attention has been given to these two points during the year under report with very gratifying results. The publication of the Orders of the Government of India having led to the impression that all plague measures had been abolished the following further summary was translated into Urdu, Marathi and Gujarati and distributed broadcast throughout the City at the end of September. Summary of the Measures to be Adopted in Bombay City Based on the Orders of the Government of India. This summary is issued in order to prevent any misapprehension on the part of the people as to the measures to be taken in dealing with plague in future. It is most necessary therefore that the efforts of Plague Officials, popular leaders and Volunteer helpers should be directed to convincing the people of the utility of the measures which they will be required to submit to, and which have been devised on a clear appreciation of the feelings and susceptibilities of the people. The good feeling that already exists between the people and the gentlemen referred to should render this a matter of: no great difficulty. MEASURES. Under the ordinary provisions of the Municipal Act Medical Practitioners will continue to be bound to report plague or any other dangerous diseases which may come to their knowledge. House-to-house searches have long since been discontinued in Bombay and will not be resumed except in isolated quarters of a ward which is otherwise free from infection. Surveillance over arrivals from infected areas is difficult to enforce in Bombay, but success in this direction may be obtained if the people directly co-operate for their own protection by giving information regarding new comers to the Plague Officers and Volunteers. There will be no compulsory corpse inspection. Removal of the sick is not considered by Government to be an effectual precaution owing to the number of cases that escape detection, hence removal of the sick will not be compulsory in Bombay. But patients who are left without anyone to look after them or who have no home will as usual be removed to hospital. Segregation of contacts will be abandoned in Bombay. Evacuation though generally accepted as a beneficial measure in Bombay will not be compulsory, but the people will be encouraged and assisted as heretofore to erect camps when a plague epidemic is threatened. As in the past also Muni- cipal Camps will be erected if considered desirable in F and G Wards for the accommodation of those too poor to build their own camps. The compulsory evacuation of chawls will cease except with the special sanction of the Municipal Commissioner and will be replaced by rigorous and thorough disinfection, where evacuation would formerly have been resorted to.
45 Disinfection will therefore henceforth be the principal measure, and it will be open to the people to go to Camp if they wish to avoid the inconvenience and dampness attendant on disinfection. Now that all fears regarding removal of patients, segregation, etc., have no longer any grounds for existence, it is expected that Medical Practitioners and the people generally will have no scruples in reporting plague or any other cases of dangerous illness by calling on the Plague Staff and Volunteers to visit them, in order that the verification of deaths may in future be as accurate as possible. In doing so they will secure their own convenience, as in every case of a death the cause of which cannot be accurately ascertained disinfection will take place. It is obviously advisable therefore that people should in their own interest report serious sickness, and have it diagnosed and verified by the Staff on plague duty. It will continue to be the duty of the Plague Staff and Volunteers to visit houses that have been infected with a view to keeping the inmates under observation, also to induce patients to go to hospital and the contacts to get them- selves inoculated. They should see to the frequent disinfection of the rooms and clothing of the people amongst whom cases of plague are found and generally to do their best to save life by advising and if necessary also prescribing for the patient. Disinfection will be most thoroughly carried out as it is a measure of the first importance in all future operations. For this reason and also as its utility has been universally acknowledged the disinfection of rooms, single houses, or adjoining houses as well, will be left entirely to the discretion of the District Officer. 25th October 1900. H. E. PRITCHARD, CAPT., Personal Assistant. The Dis- covery of Plague Cases. The sources of information at the disposal of the plague administra- tion have been the same this year as last, but whereas last year we were largely dependent for our information on Volunteers, our experience this year has been that with the assistance of our paid agencies, chiefly the Sectional Medical Officers and the corps of registration ramosis, and with the information which private practitioners are bound to give us, we have little, if any, need for reports from our volunteers. This is mainly due to the milder measures inaugurated by the Government of India which have largely removed the main incentives to concealment. The volun- teers, however, have proved very useful chiefly in reporting sickness other than plague. They were made aware and the people through them that the reporting of any kind of sickness was useful to all concerned and particularly to the people because in the event of death the Sectional Medical Officer would have already visited the house and there was no risk of disinfection being carried out unless the illness was of an infectious nature. The people generally speedily saw the advantages of this system and where they thought they would not be liable to disinfection made no difficulty about reporting sickness. It is hoped that the practice having thus been started will now continue. It is one which should prove of great value to the Health Department of the City. 12
46 The work of the volunteers in the Central District, C Ward and E Ward West, was exceptionally useful. Many of them attended daily at the district offices, accompanied the sectional medical officers on their rounds, reporting the sickness and assisting the staff in every way. The volunteers in Byculla were just as devoted and reported a considerable amount of sickness. There are only a few gentlemen in this district, but these few worked regularly throughout the year. The work in B Ward North was carried on by the old volunteers who have long served the public interest by their presence with the plague staff on their rounds but the attendance has not been as regular as in former years. In Byculla, Wari Bunder, A Ward and B Ward South, there are only a few working volunteers, they do all that is possible and are always ready when called upon to assist, but there are a few amongst them who are very regular and attend almost daily at the district offices. In F & G Wards and D Ward owing to the conditions prevailing in these districts there are but two or three members who continue to report plague and assist in the plague work of the district. Our best thanks are due to those volunteers who have continued to work. They deserve recognition for the ungrudging way in which they have given their services in a difficult and dangerous task. Most of them are gentlemen who came forward at the commencement of plague in Bombay, and to previous years, one more has now been added to their record, during which they have had to contend with one of the severest epidemics of cholera that this city has ever experienced, besides the recent plague epidemic which was as bad and perhaps more acute than any previous epidemic. A special chapter is devoted to the volunteers and their services are recorded in it. Private Practitioners. The attention of private medical practitioners and the people was drawn to the fact that under the Municipal Act the former were bound to report plague or any other dangerous disease which might come to their notice.  They were also informed that the new orders did not affect the Municipal Act. There was no time lost in impressing upon practitioners, hakims and vaids that since compulsory removal of patients to hospital had been abolished there was now no ground for fearing loss of practice if they reported their cases; that the people had also nothing to fear and their co-operation with the plague officials was specially in- vited. The result has been very fairly successful, the sickness reported being greatly in excess of that of past years, and it is probable that by degrees the people will learn that they have less to fear if they report sickness than if they conceal it. In past years the cause for conceal- ment was directly due to the compulsory removal of patients to hospitals. In the present year it was found they would not report sickness if they thought disinfection would result, but, in a case where there was no doubt about the cause of sickness being not due to plague they had no objection to report it. It was owing then to dis- infection and the inconveniences accompanying this operation that in the
47 majority of cases the people shrank from reporting sickness this year. Most of the medical practitioners who habitually gave information direct to the District Officers continued to do so this year. The following statements show the number of cases of plague and sickness from other causes reported by various doctors. It testifies to a very great increase in the feeling of confidence between themselves and the plague officials in which of course the people, their clients, must also have shared. It is evident that the verification of the cause of death by the sectional medical officers must have been carried out with sufficient thoroughness to have taught the people that if the plague staff were in doubt as to the cause of a death, disinfection would surely follow. In fact, they have been brought into closer contact with the officials in seeing to their own interests.

Surti, Dr. Narielwalla, Dr. Rozario. Many others whose names are not mentioned reported one case of sickness. In A Ward, B Ward South, and C and D Wards where the most advanced communities reside, the number o cases o plague and other sickness reported by practitioners was greater than in other parts o the City. But a glance at the two statements will show with fair ac- curacy the value o the work done by each of the practitioners. It is hoped that next year will see a greater increase in the number o cases reported, since the present measures leave no excuse for not reporting cases, on the contrary they have dispelled fear ; and concealment is useless. Sectional Medical Offi- cers, Staff and Regis- tration Ramosis. The number of cases reported by the Sectional Medical Officers and the staff rose from 6,833 to 14,339, while the Ramosis increased their total from 4,405 to 6,813. These figures are highly satisfactory and show both the efficiency of the paid establishments and the absence of con- cealment on the part of the people. The following statement gives all the figures of Plague cases reported at the various plague offices. As some officers have included suspicious cases and others not, there is some variation in the totals compared with those in the table of Plague Cases and Deaths given at page 5, but the figures are sufficiently accurate for the purpose for which they are intended. 13

52 Removal of Patients to Hospital. The compulsory removal of patients to hospital was the most un- popular of all the old plague measures. Its abolition was consequently hailed by the people with delight. The result, of course, has been that fewer patients have been removed to hospital during the year under re- port, the figures being 3,072 against 8,144 last year and on the other hand the number of known plague cases treated at home has increased from 983 cases to 3,715 cases. Against this it must be remembered that the new measures have removed fear and the tendency to conceal with the consequence that the people have discontinued the old practice of moving sick persons from one house to another in order to avoid their being sent to hospital. The persons actually removed to hospital chiefly belonged to the poorer classes who either themselves went voluntarily or were re- moved when those in attendance found them too difficult to manage as in cases of delirium. Others were driven to the hospital by poverty and lack of friends. Segregation of Contacts. It will be noticed that the number of contacts sent this year to the various health camps and hospitals is less than a fourth of those sent under compulsion last year to hospitals and camps. Nevertheless it reaches the total of 6,346. The bulk of these were the friends or relations of patients who accompanied them to hospital. It is the opinion of many of the District Officers that the abandon- ment of the policy of segregating contacts has resulted in the spread of infection but against this it must be remembered that now the people remain in their houses and make no general attempt to evade observation. This renders it easier to keep an eye on their health. Isolation of Patients. The isolation of patients who refused to go to hospital cannot be described as satisfactory except in the comparatively few cases which occurred in the houses of the well-to-do. Ordinarily the patient was kept in the room in which he became ill, his family having nowhere else to go remained with him and he was visited in the ordinary manner by many of his friends. The plague staff did their best to induce the people to take precautions, but their efforts met with little or no success. They carried out such disinfection as was possible, had all clothing sterilised as often as they could, but beyond that had to be content with watching the health of the remaining members of the family. Capt. Lockhart Mure discusses the subject of segregation of patients in private quarters as follows:- Though in theory it would be very nice if a private house were transferred into practically a private hospital yet in practice you will find that no matter what you do there is constant communication going on. Disinfectants are freely supplied but you cannot prevent the constant going and coming of visitors into what is generally an infected, badly lighted and badly ventilated house. Doubtless this causes contact cases among the friends and to a certain extent neighbours may also suffer, but at the same time I think it is questionable whether the few extra cases are not amply compensated for by the absence of concealment. The people will not hide cases or move them about from one place to another when they quite understand that there is no object in their doing so.
53 There was a fair proportion of recoveries amongst those who were segregated in their homes in B Ward North. Lieut. Dalgliesh states the conditions under which this happened as follows:- The total number of suffering cases found during the year was 406 out of which 162 were removed to Hospital, 127 were left in their houses being in a moribund condition and 117 were isolated. Out of the 117 isolated 75 recovered. Isolation as far as the majority of the people living in this district is concerned, is purely imaginary. When one considers that a family of 9 or 10 persons live in one small room it is apparent that isolation of sick people is not possible. Isolation, therefore, in this district was practically another name for non- removal to Hospital. I regret that no records have been kept as to what effect isolation has had in spreading the plague among the family of the patient, but according to my own impressions, the spread of infection has not been very noticeable. The people have become so indifferent to plague that no difficulty is experienced in finding contacts. In B Ward South there were 376 patients segregated in private quarters. Concerning these Lieut. Shakespeare states that 264 died and 104 recovered; of the 264 there were 103 who died within 24 hours of the case coming to the knowledge of the staff. Lieut. Shakespeare comments on the precautions taken in cases not removed to hospital. He states as follows:- The precautions taken consist of supplying disinfectants to the tenants, showing them their use; removal of all bedding and kit at least once a week for sterilization disinfection of the room, if possible; continual visits by the plague staff. Even with all these measures it appears impossible to secure isolation. The word isolation has been generally used with reference to those who have been left in their dwellings and must not be considered to mean all that isolation means in its proper sense. Dr. Matthai of B Ward South gives several instances of contacts who were in attendance on patients, catching the infection from which they afterwards died. He says:- I mention two instances (1) In De Souza Street a child of 7 years died of Plague; just before her death the mother was attacked; 2 days after her sister was attacked. (2) In Samuel Street No 77, a girl was attacked with Plague; a day after her death, her father and only sister went to Matoonga where the father was attacked and died in 4 days' time. The sister returned to the same house in Samuel Street soon after the father's death. On the very day she reached the house she got fever and died of Plague on the 4th day.  All these cases were Bubonic type. I can give more instances, if necessary, to show the danger of isolating cases in houses. 14
54 In D Ward there were 190 patients segregated at home and Capt. Stuart, the District Officer, reports that 48 recovered. He holds that although the staff carried out the orders with regard to them, yet it would be absurd to imagine that segregation proper could be carried out among the people in his district. He says that it was impossible to pre- vent the healthy from mixing with the sick. As regards those who were removed to hospital, one or two contacts invariably accompanied the sick, but the remainder could not be persuad- ed to go to camp. Lieut. Ballantyne, District Officer of E Ward West, states that there were 134 recoveries out of a total of 482 isolated cases. Capt. Morris reports with regard to Byculla district that no less than 117 plague cases were found in a moribund condition, and that there were scarcely a dozen recoveries amongst those isolated in their homes. The mass of the people in this district are poor and live in a state of overcrowdedness. He states with regard to contacts:-"Easy to find them, but they have very quickly learnt that the District Plague Officer has no power to enforce segregation." Capt. Boileau District Officer, F & G Wards, reports that 45 per cent. of the cases isolated recovered in the Parel section of this district, but 86 per cent. died in Mahim and Worli sections.  For the whole district he states there were 126 recoveries out of a total of 508 persons segre- gated. Dr. De Costa, Sectional Medical Officer for Parel section, states as follows with regard to infection being conveyed from man to man:- For 104 cases isolated I can count on at least 312 contacts. Of these not more than 7 have contracted plague, and these were attacked within a very short period of the time the cases were attacked. So that it cannot be positively asserted that they were not at all infected from the original cause. In fact, man to man infection may be said to be very much smaller than is supposed and the possibility of man infecting man (excluding wound infection) seems to be infinitely small as compared with infection by rats (either directly or indirectly through the soil.) In cases where rats have been found dead a crop of cases has always been found; whereas where single cases are found no report of rats has come to hand. Imported cases and isolated cases do not appear to spread infection at all (or if so to a very small extent) and I should like to give it as my opinion that I consider isolation to have had the very best results during the year under report. Capt. Bolton, District Officer for the Central District, states his views as follows regarding the segregation of plague patients in their homes:- Isolation if carried out properly should be beneficial to the patient and of no great danger to the inmates of the house; but the bogus isolation as carried out in Bombay is undoubtedly a source of great danger to the people. It causes an un-
55 necessary amount of annoyance to the other inhabitants of the building. By repeated disinfections, it causes waste of solution, unnecessary hard work on the staff, and disheartens the District Officer. In my opinion the isolation of a case should be left entirely to the discretion of the District Officer who is an officer and a gentleman. To lay down a regulation indiscriminately and say it must be carried out, with- out limitation, is a measure of the worst kind and so isolation has proved to Bombay. The conditions of the people are generally such that isolation becomes a farce. Take for instance a chawl like 389, Duncan Road, a large barrack, some 60 feet by 30 feet without any partition walls, latrines, at one end, and wash house at the other. Some 20 families live in this chawl; no privacy whatever. They live like a pack of hounds in a kennel, though not half so clean. A case of plague takes place in the centre. You induce the friends to send the patient to hospital. They refuse.  How are you going to isolate the patient ? You cannot turn the people into the street; you cannot put them into another room, as there is no room to put them in; you cannot send them to camp, as they refuse to go. What are you to do ? All you can do is to place the patient as far from those surrounding him as possible and disinfect the house, knowing full well that as soon as your back is turned they will go back and crowd around him: Dr. Fazl Ahmed has had the best success with isolated patients, but his patients have been well-to-do people, having their own medical attendants who carry out instructions, and see that orders are obeyed.  Under such circumstances isolation is a benefit, otherwise a curse. I will quote a few instances in which isolation has been one of the means of spreading plague throughout my district although every endeavour to carry out the orders of Government on the subject were complied with. The following particulars of plague cases in which the isolation of the patients was effected will show that isolation is inefficacious, and that it is practically im- possible to prevent the relatives of the patients from coming in close contact with the patients, and thus obviating the danger of infection:- A case of plague which was of the bubonic type occurred in a Dhobi family consisting of five members, on the 6th of January 1901, at No. 6, Packmodia Street ground floor, which house has presented a clean bill of health from the first outbreak of plague in Bombay. It was not known how the deceased caught the infection, but it was believed that he might have caught the plague from the infected clothing which he had to wash, as he was a washerman. This Dhobi died, and it was the death-memo which brought the case to notice.  On the 7th of the January two other persons, who were in close attendance on the deceased, con- tracted symptoms of plague. I disinfected a room in another house, No. 24, Packmodia Street, and isolated them in it. In the meantime, No. 6, Packmodia Street was disinfected. The relations about two hours after brought the patients back to the original house without my knowledge. One of them died on the same day, while the other survived till the 12th. The fourth and fifth, who, as a matter of necessity, were in attendance on the deceased, got virulent attacks of plague, and died on the 14th and 15th January respectively. Thus by isolation the whole family was destroyed. A patient was isolated in house No. 252, Ghellabhai Street, as he did not wish to be sent to hospital. He was one of the leaders of Ghellabhai Street Mahomedan faction. He was attended by his nephew who resided at house No. 244, Ghella- bhai Street. While in attendance he also became attacked. He was brought home to 244, Ghellabhai Street where he died. During his illness the inmates in spite of remonstrances from me used to go and visit him as soon as our backs were turned. This started the epidemic and 24 cases occurred within a month, and was only stopped by the house being disinfected from top to bottom.
56 Capt. Smith sums up his views regarding home isolation as follows:- It will be seen from the reports of the Sectional Medical Officers attached that where the sick can be kept apart from the rest of the people in the house and can be looked after properly, and where all sanitary precautions are taken there is no doubt that home isolation has very few objectionable features. On the contrary where the people are poor and ignorant and are overcrowded and do not take any precautions and refuse to allow the sick to be removed to hospital there is no doubt that the so called home isolation is most harmful and dangerous to all contacts and neighbours, and tends to spread the disease to a very great extent indeed. Allowing home isolation has not in any way tended to increase the number of cases reported by the people. Concealment is still practised amongst the people and very extensively indeed amongst the well to do and richer classes. It will also be seen from the Sectional Medical Officer's reports that a very small number of cases were removed to hospital. This also applies to the private and caste hospitals also.  There is no doubt in my mind, but that the sterilization of the clothes, etc., in these cases, and the disinfection of the rooms after the recovery or death of patients has undoubtedly  prevented the disease spreading as it would otherwise un- doubtedly have done. The reports of the Sectional Medical Officers of C Ward are full of examples of cases which  support the correctness of the deductions made by Capt. Smith, the District Officer.  In the Market section there were 269 patients segregated of whom 97 recovered and the remainder died. There were 211 voluntary removals to hospitals. Dr. Britto in charge of the Market section remarks as follows:- Under the circumstances the patient was allowed to remain in the same room along with others. Besides, in chawls where rooms are about 10' x 8', and inhabited by the poor class, where in all cases there is overcrowding, "home isolation" is a misnomer. The effect of this rule has proved drastic to the poor class, as it helped to spread the disease. The people being poor and unable to afford proper medical aid, died for want of same. Many cases have come under notice, where some of the people were treated by home remedies and so called specifics, while others were kept without any treatment. Other cases have come under notice where all the members of the family have been found sick with plague and no person to look after them. They were kept locked up in their rooms by friends who did not care to remove them to hospital. A notable instance of this kind came under observation at house No. 13, Carnac 2nd Cross Lane. A  family consisting of mother and son were lying side by side suffering from plague and in a state of delirium. They were locked in the room by some friends and were accidentally found, while on my rounds. Another instance of this kind was noted in No. 51, Sheikh Memon Street. The head of the family died of plague on 9th January 1901. Four other members of the family were lying very ill with fever of a suspicious type. They were with difficulty induced to go to hospital, where it was found they were suffering from relapsing fever.  All of them recovered under treatment. These were Kathiawari refugees. Besides the ignorance and apathy of the people as to the risk they incur from close contact with people suffering from the disease adds another factor to the spread of the disease.
57 It is difficult to say definitely in cases in which whole families have been attacked, how far rat infection has played its part and how much of the infection is due to personal contact with patients. At house No. 109, Kalbadevi Road, a whole family of 7 persons was attacked with plague, out of which all died. Four people were found sick by me on 29th Janu- ary 1901. The history given was that the uncle was attacked four days previously, and his son was attacked three days after, and on the 29th idem the two nephews were attacked, i.e., fully 7 days after. There was a death in the same room on 27th idem. On 9th February 1901, another relative who had attended on these people, was attacked. On the 10th February 1901 the brother of the first deceased died of the same disease; and on 13th February 1901 the remaining relative was attacked with plague. Both these were in attendance on their relatives. Another instance of this kind was noted at No. 46, Kitchen Garden. A woman sickened with plague on 23rd January 1901 and died on the 28th idem. Her hus- band and two children sickened on the 29th idem. The father died on the 30th and the two children were then removed to hospital. On 3rd February three other relatives got plague and were removed to hospital. The remaining two relatives sickened on the 4th February 1901 and were removed to hospital. Dr. Gimi, in charge of Dhobi Talao section, states that out of 120 patients segregated, 49 recovered and the remainder died, while there were 126 removed to hospital during the year. Dr. Bardi, the Sectional Medical Officer for Fanaswadi and Bhulesh- war sections, states his views as follows:- Isolation in the true sense of the word was impossible in a majority of cases. How many a time have I seen healthy persons in the same bed with a plague stricken-relative and dissuaded them against such a practice, but all to no purpose. As far as I was able I always advised them to throw their excreta into the nahnis and pour over the excreta some antiseptic solution, which could be easily obtained from us, or even hot water, and to keep the patients alone in separate beds, but this advice was never acted on in the majority of cases. The following is a very good case in point as regards incidence of plague in a house in which cases are isolated. It must, however, be borne in mind that all necessary precautions were neglected, as they were in this case. A servant of a naikin living in No. 58-62, Fanaswadi got plague on 22nd January 1901, and he was isolated in the house under the treatment of Dr. P. J. de Souza, on the 2nd floor. The other persons in the family occupied the 1st floor. The patient died on 27th January 1901. Only the room in which the patient had been was disinfected.  The naikin who had moved to No. 18, Fanaswadi, got plague the same day that the servant died, i.e., 27th January 1901. This woman recovered subsequently after a sloughing bubo.  I was then informed that another member of the same household got plague in another part of the town and died there. I think, that one good point about the present system of home isolation is that it is the means of bringing almost all cases of plague to our notice, and as such it has been decidedly successful though there is still a good deal of conceal- ment, as is proved by the large number of plague deaths which are reported after death, and of which no information was received during life. And this after making due allowance for all those cases in which the disease has run a very rapid course. Moreover, it must be remembered that the diagnosis is anything but easy, and the patients die before there is time for a report to be made. 15
58 Looking to the popular tendencies and the results so far achieved I think isolation as a measure is one in the right direction especially if we compare the recoveries and deaths in those isolated:- For Fanaswadi. 48 deaths. 24 recoveries. 3 absconded. 2 hospital. 77 For Bhuleshwar. 86 deaths. 29 recoveries. 3 hospital. 118 The following will give some idea of the experiences met with in enquiries into the cause of death and the difficulties in tracing the inci- dence of plague amongst those in contact with plague patients, they are given by Dr. Bardi:- A Koli child, male, died in No. 6 (sub No. 4), Khunderao wadi on the evening of 1st January 1901. When I went the next day to verify the death I found two females in the room, who produced a bottle of medicine, and asked me to read the name of the doctor who had been treating the child. As the name on the bottle was a female one, my suspicions were aroused and on a light being produced I saw a female lying on a bed with a big bubo in her right arm pit, high fever and a very bad pulse. She was isolated in the house. The child's death was taken as one due to plague. The same day a Koli male living in the next room went voluntarily to the Hindu Fever Hospital. I did not hear of this case until I received a memo, from the H. F. Hospital. The next day, i. e., 2nd January 1901, the father of the child and husband of the woman was down with plague and was isolated in another room, but he was subse- quently removed to the Hindu Fever Hospital where he died two days after. About this time all the tenants of the 1st floor had left, except a poor Brahmin widow, who worked out the whole day, but slept in the house, with her son aged 12 years. This woman was found to be suffering from plague by the D. P. O. C Ward in the middle of the day. I saw her in the evening in company with Dr. Vamanrao Mahadavrao, a medical practitioner and also a volunteer. She was in a dangerous condition. Dr. Mahadavrao undertook to treat her gratis. This woman recovered and a month and half later went to her native country cured of the plague, but with a facial paralysis and partial loss of speech. On 23rd January 1901 a case of plague was reported in No. 348, Kalbadevi Road, and on going there I learnt that the patient, a boy, died the same day, and that he was the son of the brother-in-law of the abovementioned Brahmin widow and that he and his parents had lived in No. 6, Khanderao Wadi but had left it as above mentioned. On 25th January 1901 i.e., two days after, the father of the boy got plague and died two days after. From inquiry I ascertained that the widow and her son used to visit the house in Kalbadevi Road, and that the last two deceased ( father and son ) used to nurse the widow occasionally during her illness.
59 Dr. Cama, Sectional Medical Offiicer for Kumbharwada section of C Ward, states that out of 136 patients segregated at home, 29 recovered, but points out the conditions pertaining in his section as follows:- The number of suffering cases was 321, of these 114 were removed to Hospital *  178 were isolated at home 29 were found in a moribund condition. 321 *  29 recovered; 5 absconded. Home isolation was not practicable in this section as about 80 per cent. of such cases were isolated in rooms not more than 8' x 6' in size with a window (put in more for appearance sake than use) often with 12 to 18 people living and sleeping in the same room as the patient. Although persuasion was tried the people did not like sending sick persons to hospital and paid no attention to any advice as regards how to treat the patients or the excreta, etc.; in fact, they neglected all sanitary precautions. The effects of this so called isolation on the people living in the same room as the patients was most harmful indeed. 47. 1st Carpenter Street.-First case occurred on 24th February 1901. On 25th February 1901 three deaths from plague occurred in the same room. They were all related to one another. The first was taken ill about 10 days before, the 2nd about 5 days before, and the 3rd and 4th about 3 days before death. A great many more instances can be given, and they point very clearly to the fact that keeping the sick under these conditions has spread the disease to a very large extent indeed amongst contacts. The following is an example:- 159, Northbrook Street.-This is a very large house, 4 stories high. On the ground floor there are 11 rooms of which 5 were empty as improvements were being made in the house. There were approximately 50 people, and there were 12 deaths from plague amongst them in a month. All these cases were treated as home isolation cases. People frequently asked for prescriptions which were always supplied. The people in this section have very primitive ideas as to the treatment of plague.  In one case two bottles of tonic were administered, and in another some Bass' beer was given. The people were greatly disappointed at the failure of these remedies. As regards well-to-do people in this section the privilege of home isolation has undoubtedly increased the chances of patients, in fact, made them equal to those of people sent to hospital, as they are nursed and looked after at home and efficient medical aid is engaged. If required many instances can be quoted of the recovery of cases under the above conditions. The total number isolated under such circumstances was about 20 and out of these 8 recovered. In the case of infected houses 12 more recovered as the patients were kept separate in well ventilated rooms.
60 Evacuation. The policy pursued this year with regard to evacuation is generally indicated in the Summary of Orders for District Officers. (See page 38.) While therefore private health camps were encouraged in every way, there was a reduction rather than an increase in the provision made at public expense for the general population The opinion of the district officers is that it would be well if more semi-permanent camps could be formed for the reception of the inhabitants of the worst infected houses and localities. Greater efforts will probably be made next year in that direction. Lieut. Dalgliesh in charge of B Ward North had the control of an excellent camp near Elphinstone Bridge, and yet he found he had to use persuasion to induce the people to evacuate their infected quarters and take refuge in the camp which was close at hand. He states :- From time to time I succeeded in getting the tenants of some of the worst infected houses to go to camp, and the results so far as checking the plague among them were successful in every case. When they returned to the same houses again, plague nearly always once more broke out after a lapse of time varying from fifteen days to two months from the date of re-occupation. One great advantage in removing contacts and evicts to segregation camp lies in the fact that a sick person can be removed straight to hospital from camp, whereas one cannot do so in their own houses unless they are willing to go. The following among many others tend to shew that evacuation of infected houses is a good preventive measure. 12-14, 2nd. Nowroji Hill, Smith.-This was a small house inhabited by 50 or 60 people. Six deaths from plague and 1 suspicious occurred between 8th January 1901 and 22nd January 1901. The house was vacated on the 23rd January 1901 and re-occupied again on 11th February 1901, having been disinfected in the meanwhile. No more cases of plague have occurred in the house up to date. 9, 1st Nowroji Hill, North, 3rd Cross Lane.-Two deaths from plague occurred on the ground-floor of this house, which was one with a very bad previous record, on the 8th February 1901 and 9th February 1901. The ground-floor was vacated on 10th February 1901 and re-occupied on 1st March 1901. Two suffering cases were removed to hospital from the camp on 10th February 1901 and on 12th February 1901. No cases occurred in the house on re-occupation. Lieut. Shakespeare gives the following statement of the experience gathered by watching the results of evacuation and re-occupation of infected houses in B Ward, South :- Street Address.

?61 Captain Smith gives his opinions on evacuation in C Ward as follows:- This year no houses were evacuated by the Plague Department. A certain amount of voluntary evacuation has been carried out by the different communities in this ward. Where it was done by the people themselves they went out into camp or to the suburbs and benefited to the extent of practically escaping the ravages of plague.  An excellent instance of what happens when evacuation is not practised is given in the case of 1st Carpenter Street, Kumbharwada, where the people suffered severely this year; because they stayed too long and neglected to go to camp in time. Dr. Bardi reports that in Dhobichi Wadi and Kadiachi Wadi the people living in these houses evacuated them of their own accord and put up matting shelters for themselves in the compound only a few yards away from their houses. He says:- "That the people are quite willing to vacate their houses, provided camp "accommodation is available, is proved by the numerous requests made to "me and the District Officer for camp accommodation. They did not avail "themselves of the accommodation in the Goculdass Tejpal camp, as the "limit of time for which they could stay was only 10 days." Antoba Wadi is a good instance of the result of non-evacuation, the plague having been very bad this year, whilst in former years its ravages were stopped by timely evacuation. There was very little evacuation carried out in D Ward, Capt. Stuart gives his views and experience on the subject as follows:- I am perfectly convinced had some of the well known chawls been forcibly evacuated there would not have been a continuance of plague in those places. Both Dr. Contractor and Mr. Pednekar are of the same opinion. The better class of natives went of their own accord into camps when they found the place was badly in- fected. The Marine Lines camp was made use of. Others who could afford it went off to Dadar and elsewhere, and erected sheds of their own accord. If some of the others had had some place where they could have gone to they would have done the same; but being poor they could not afford to erect sheds or go out of Bombay. They object to being huddled up with all sorts and conditions of men. Had sheds been set apart for them, I am sure, they would have availed themselves of the secu- rity. As for the lower classes it is absolutely impossible to get them to go-they will not. Forcible ejection and evacuation seems the only remedy, and it does not allow them to travel from chawl to chawl carrying infection. I will quote just some instances where evacuation has had a beneficial effect. Mr. Pednekar on account of number of cases and deaths in 32, Khetwadi 6th Lane; 23, Khetwadi 6th Lane; and 9, Falkland 5th Cross Lane persuaded the people to evacuate for a short time-only about a month. The result was the people took the hint and the ground floor of 32, Khetwady 6th Lane became vacated. 23, Khetwadi 6th Lane was wholly vacated and the grater portion of 9, Falkland 5th Cross Lane was also vacated. Disinfection was carefully and thoroughly carried out. So that since there have been hardly any cases in these places. Dr. Contractor persuaded the people in Bhatwady which was badly infected to vacate. Some erected temporary huts in the compound. Others went to Grant Road Health Camp, the result being plague was at once checked, and since then very few cases have occurred there. 16
62 In Girgaum exists a better class of people of course, and they removed to private camps on the seaside ( Marine Lines ), the result being that there has been less mortality this year from plague. Now, I will mention an instance of a place where had it been evacuated immediately the loss of life would not have been so heavy. On the flats at Tardeo the sweepers of the Health Department had sheds. Plague broke out there and in 3 days 30 cases occurred, and before evacuation a total of 60 was reached. The place was eventually evacuated and the people sent to Arthur Road Hospital camp. Had this been done at the commencement there would never have been sixty. It would have been also impossible to isolate cases as there were no less than 6 persons in each room. Another instance of the good effect of evacuation. In No. 169, Girgaum Back Road a woman was attacked with plague and died on the 28th February. Her daughter fell sick and died also of plague on the 5th March. The people in the adjoining rooms were advised to evacuate which they did and returned after a month. No more cases or deaths have taken place in that house. Captain Moore's report on the evacuation carried out in Wari Bunder district is interesting. The case of the Narielwadi villagers who neglected the opportunity offered them to camp out will probably be a lesson to these people. He states :- In my opinion, and in my Sectional Medical Officer's, evacuation, combined of course with disinfection, is indisputably the most efficacious measure. Every facility was offered but in the case of the Narielwadi villagers they refused to have a camp until it was too late to build one such as would suit them. The following were the most notable places evacuated some at the occupants own suggestions, and others after days, and even weeks of persuasion :- 14, Belvedere Road to Wari Bunder Camp, not a large house, 15 plague, 5 cholera and 5 other causes between 1st June 1900 and 6th October 1900 ; not a single death after removal to Camp. Dhakji Purbhu's Wadi.-Private camp, no more cases. Bowan's Chawls-Private camp, no more cases ; 1 and 2, Gurup Deo Road-Private camp, 2 more cases ; Mugal's Chawl-Private camp, no case ; 4, and 32, Parel Road-Private camp, no case ; Sussex Road,-Private camp, no case; Coliwada, Reay Road,-Private camp, no case. "Khadda" 41-15, Nesbit Road between 31st January 1901 and 26th February 1901 ; 26 cases and 25 deaths; eventually pursuaded to come to Wari Bunder camp; no more cases. 31, De Lima Street.-Parsis, Five plague cases in one family ; came to Wari Bunder camp ; after that no fresh cases. Ambewadi-Private camp; after which no more cases. The people in the following localities neglected to use the camp provided for them:-   Cases. Deaths. Narielwadi Village 38 38 20, Babula Tank Road 17 15 12, Byramji Hall Lane 33 31 6, Mazagon Road 83 77 6, B B Mazagon Road 25 21 6, D Mazagon Road 39 32 5, Belvedere Road 14 13 7, Belvedere Road 21 20 Haji Cassum's Chawls 22 21
63 In the case of Narielwadi Village the large Municipal camp on the spot into which the village turned out yearly was half burnt down in October last. As this ground was paying heavy rent and the camp was unused, I recommended it should be pulled down. At the same time these people were offered a good sized camp and hospital to be built just across the road and within 10 yards of the village if they would promise to use it, and the plan was actually drawn out. They are all Mahomedans and a queer tempered lot, and after taking three weeks to talk it over, said they would not use it. About the end of March plague broke out badly. The Kotwal then begged for a piece of ground close to the village. I forwarded this application and suggested a piece of ground. But after much correspondance no ground being available as they would not come to Wari Bunder Camp they had to remain in their houses. The result was that there were 38 cases and 38 deaths between 23 small houses and 6 huts. Captain Moore was most successful in inducing the tenants of many houses possessed of compounds to build huts for themselves and remain outside their houses whilst the epidemic lasted. Here the means adopted to induce optional evacuation were simply persuasive arguments and were attended with the best results.  The people escaped almost unscathed though the epidemic was raging around them. The same steps were taken in C Ward but to. a smaller extent. Captain Boileau reports as follows with regard to F and G Wards :- This measure has, with the exception of Parel, been carried out wholesale in my ward and with very good results. The numbers in the camp this year were not so large as last year, but the numbers of the people from my own district were just as many as in the year before. Most of the well-to-do people left the district when plague broke out and went to live outside the confines of the houses and three full trains used to go out and come in morning and evening. Many people went to live in the fields the moment they found dead rats in their houses, and amongst these there was very little plague. It is a pity that there were no camps for the poorer class, such as I advocated early in the year. Had I had any place to send them to I could have evacuated many chawls and saved many lives. What I would like to do would be to build one or two large camps in and about Parel where there is plenty of open ground and into which I could send the inmates of chawls as they became infected. There would be no opposition to this-rather the opposite-and the camps would always be crowded. For the rest of the district people prefer their own huts, and I have no difficulty in getting them to evacuate when their homes become infected. At the present stage of our knowledge, I consider evacuation to be one of the most important measures to be adopted for the prevention of plague, and the abolition of this measure in its compulsory form has had bad results in the year under report. I trust that next year we shall be allowed more discretionary powers in this direction. There is a great deal of open ground in this district which if properly utilized could be the means of saving many lives and those who have seen the results of evacuation in this district are well aware of its enormous value. All the ground to the north, east and west of Matunga, an old station, has never been camped on. It is capable of accommodating, 40,000 people if properly laid out. There would be difficulty for drainage and water which I think could be overcome by proper arrangements and the site is near the railway.
64 Captain Bolton, reporting on the evacuation carried out in the Central District, states as follows :- Up to the end of August the District Officer, could, if he thought it necessary, evacuate a house. It generally meant in this district that should three or more cases of plague take place in a house within a short period of time, that house was evacuated. Compulsory evacuation was given up in August, and special sanction had to be asked for to carry out this measure. The people could evacuate a house of their own free will, if they desired to do so, but no compulsion was to be used, two instances are here given of voluntary evacuation proving the benefits of evacuation. Dr. Munshi states :-A case of plague occurred in House No. 255, Duncan Road, on the 9th January and another on the 14th January. A third occurred on the 1st of February, and between that date and 19th February, five more cases occurred. By impressing upon the occupants the necessity for evacuation and the very encouraging results afforded thereby to this very house last year, I succeeded in getting them to come and live in the Northbrook Garden Camp. This was on the 19th February. The house was thoroughly disinfected. In the camp I detected three more cases of plague on the 25th February. These were removed to hospital. These three had evidently absorbed the poison while living in the infected house, and the germs were in a state of incubation. No more cases occurred and since the return of the people to their homes, the house has been free from plague. Mr. Samuel states :-No 1, Agripada was voluntarily evacuated. The tenants of the house made up their minds to go to camp instead of living in a damp and infected house. In this small house 5 cases of plague occurred within a month. The evacuation took place on the 4th January 1901, and the house was thoroughly disinfected throughout in the meantime. The people were allowed to return after 10 days, and no more cases of plague occurred in the house for 7 weeks. The bad effects of the abolition of evacuating houses may be seen from the history of a house given below:- In 244, Ghellabhai Street, Part I, 24 cases of plague occurred in a month and had I been able to vacate the house shortly after the outbreak, I do not believe the people would have suffered so severely. Inoculation. In the year previous to the one under report inoculation was pushed with much energy and 158,000 persons were inoculated at a cost to Municipal Funds of Rs. 42,000. Special fees were paid to Sectional Medical Officers, touts were given half an anna for every person they brought up, and four annas were paid to each person treated. In cases of subsequent prostration monetary assistance was given from the Discretional Relief Fund. During the year under report this system was changed.  First of all, in view of the decline in the epidemic money payments were discon- tinued as an inducement, and the four anna dole was only given to those contacts and evicts who underwent the operation; in other words, inocu- lation became limited to those only who lived in localities whence the disease had not disappeared.  These localities gradually became very few and in September the system became modified still further by the receipt of orders from the Government of Bombay dated September 4th 1900 limiting the cases in which expenditure might be incurred from
?65 the Discretional Relief Fund, and by the receipt of the new plague regulations issued in the same month. These regulations, by abolishing compulsory segregation and evacuation removed the main inducement which led to inoculation, and all that could be done to encourage it was the opening of fixed stations where doctors attended at stated hours, furnishing the necessary instruments and serum and giving every facility for having the operation performed, the Sectional Medical Officers attending patients at their own houses if so desired. The payment of money from Municipal funds was discontinued. No change was made in the system of recording inoculations, but to ensure that they were genuine no certificate of inoculation was allowed to be issued without the knowledge and approval of the District Officer. The stations mentioned below were opened in November for purposes of inoculation and were maintained throughout the year. Dr. A. G. Viegas, Dr. P. J. DeSouza, Dr. Trilokekar and a few other private medical practitioners also opened stations and assisted in inoculation work throughout the year.    List of Inoculation Stations. Inoculation Station.

?66 The total number of persons inoculated was roughly 7,000, a figure which shows clearly how little previous experience has taught the masses to believe in the efficacy of the operation.

Moore reports as follows regarding inoculation :- Inoculation is practically a dead letter in E Ward East Wari Bunder. All the staff are inoculated as well as a few outside people mostly respectable well to do people-Portuguese and Parsees. There are 2 volunteers in the district neither of whom have been inoculated. I have made many attempts to get people inoculated and have been well backed up by the Sectional Medical Officers but we are always met with the same reply, " It is no good. It stops our work. How much will you give us. " One disinfection coolie who had been inoculated got plague and recovered in six days. Dr. Dalal in Mazagaon was supplied with all the necessary instruments and offered free inoculations in Mazagaon but could not get a single person to allow it and so gave it up. Here is an instance of good effect of inoculation, " Khudda," 24-45, Nesbit Road, occupied by about 360 people-all Mahars-working in P. & O., G. I. P., B. B. & C. I. Railway Shops. In 1899-1900 most were inoculated. There were no cases amongst the inoculated and only 6 cases amongst the non-inoculated. This year they steadily refused inoculation without compensation. Plague began on 1st February and there was one death per day till they were all eventually persuaded to come into Wari Bunder Camp on 28th February. From 1st February to 28th February there occurred 28 plague deaths with 3 suspicious cases and 2 were removed to hospital. There was no case amongst the inoculated in this ward. Captain Smith makes the following remarks :- Inoculation as a plague measure is to all intents and purposes as far as this ward is concerned non-existent. In the beginning of the year under report a certain amount of inoculation was done as at that time compulsory removal to hospital in the case of sick people and compulsory removal to camps in the case of contacts were the chief measures. A large number of people accepted inoculation in preference to going to camp as the lesser evil of the two. Since the above measures were done away with and moral suasion was recommended as a means to inducing the people to be inoculated, and when in addition to this the dole of rice and gratuity of annas four per person inoculated was done away with and replaced by a gratuity of annas two only, and that only when it could be ascertained that the person inoculated had suffered loss of wages, etc., inoculation stopped practically.
68 As far as the poorer classes are concerned inoculation will not succeed as they all live a hand to mouth existence and being inoculated means that they cannot work and so have to rest content with empty stomachs. This matter has been already fully dealt with in former reports. As far as the well-to-do are concerned, the only ones that get inoculated with few exceptions are those people who have business in or are going to reside in the Hyderabad State. In this state people are subjected to various restrictions, etc., if not inoculated and consequently they get inoculated to save themselves a lot of worry and trouble. As regards the future of inoculation I have one or two suggestions to make. One is that the people as regards the poorer classes should be treated a great deal more liberally than at present is the case. I would advocate reverting to the old system of giving annas four per person inoculated, but this payment should be restricted to the poorer classes who undoubtedly suffer great hardship from being inoculated. I would not, however, follow the old system of having fixed inoculation stations for the poorer classes ; but would suggest that when any inoculations are done they should be done there and then in the dwellings of the people inoculated. Similar to the way inoculation was carried out amongst the badly infected houses in Kumbharwada last year by Lieut. H. E. Browne A. D. O., and Doctor Cama, S. M. O. In this way not only would the people living in all badly infected chawls, etc., be rendered, a comparatively speaking immune to plague, but at the same time a large waste of money would not occur as the landlords would be asked to assist the plague authorities. Of course, there is one thing that would have to be guarded against, and that is, that all concerned in the work should be plainly made to understand that inoculation should not be indiscriminate, as it apparently was last year, and that only people living actually in badly infect- ed localities should be pressed as far as possible to submit themselves to inoculation. Another proposal I have to make is similar to what I made in one of my weekly reports. The benefits of inoculation being undoubtedly very great for a limited period, I wish to suggest that in places like Bombay where evacuation cannot be carried out properly or effectively, inoculation should be made compulsory on all residents of the place. As the periodical interval of time at which plague recurs is known, being about thirteen months, I consider every body should be obliged to get themselves inoculated about six weeks previous to the expected outbreak of plague in epidemic form. Travellers and others who are only remain- ing for a very short period of time would not be required to be inoculated. No one should be obliged to be inoculated with plague prophylactic more than once a year. I think this combined with thorough disinfection and, if possible, evacuation on as large a scale as possible, would make a most distinct and marked impression on the plague mortality in future epidemics. This year I have been informed by Dr. A. G. Viegas, J. P., and Khan Sahib Bhicaji Ruttonji Rana, his secretary, who has invariably assisted him that a certain number of poor people came and asked to be inoculated, but when they were told that they would not get annas four for each person inoculated they went away without being inoculated. I think this shows that a good many of the poorer classes would come forward if they were paid four annas for being inoculated.
69 I might mention one fact that may also have some bearing on the objection many people have to being inoculated and that is that the doses of prophylactic for inoculation have increased up to 10 c. c. in some brews. This is a very large amount and some practitioners have asked me, when I could only supply serum of 10 c. c. dosage, if it was not possible to get some serum of say 5. c. c. dosage as their patients objected strongly to having such a large quantity injected into them. At the end of the year Dr. P. J. de Souza of New Hanuman Lane was practically the only one doing any inoculation in this ward, and the only people he gets are those I have already mentioned as having some connection with Hyderabad. Inoculation certificates have a regular market value, I have been informed and I forget the exact rates, but I believe as far as I can remember they go from Rupees five and upwards. Some well-to-do persons, I have every reason to believe, are prepared to pay very highly for inoculation certificates, provided they themselves are not inoculated. In view of the fact that forged inoculation certificates were put into circulation, I have made the following arrangements to have a check on certi- ficates. As soon as any person has been inoculated by a practitioner in this ward the certificate book is sent to me, and I countersign and initial foil and counter-foil at the same time ; I see that all particulars are filled in; and that the left thumb impression is a good one. None of the staff of this ward were inoculated. I am not in a position to give any instances of deaths having occurred amongst inoculated people. As far as I could ascertain the general attitude of the richer classes was quite antagonistic to this measure. This was also the case with a large proportion of the poorer classes. As I have pointed out a certain number would have got themselves inoculated, but for the fact that no money compensation was given as well. The boom in inoculation was last year. This year no meetings were held in this ward. Volunteers and others did not give any special assistance this year. Great difficulty was experienced in ascertaining whether persons who died from or were attacked with plague had previously been inocu- lated or not; but it is safe to say that the vast majority of those attacked had not been inoculated within the previous 8 months.
CHAPTER IV. DISINFECTION. The Government of India in their Resolution on the Report of the Indian Plague Commission emphasized the results to be expected from chemical disinfection by a specially trained staff, and placed this measure at the head of their recommendations. It was further pointed out that to apply one method efficiently and thoroughly was better than to apply a number of methods with an inadequate and insufficiently trained staff, and in large towns where plague was constantly recurring chemical disinfection was the chief measure to be relied upon. Chemical disinfection was accordingly adopted as the principal measure in plague operations this year. The question of the staff to be employed was considered, and it was found that the minimum establishment necessary to maintain efficiency in plague operations in the City should be fixed at thirteen Staff Corps officers and five English doctors.  This estimate was accepted and approved by Government. About the commencement of the year the required number of English doctors were obtained and on arrival they were appointed as Personal Assistants to the District Officers, and the training and supervision of the staff employed on disinfection became their most important duty.  The steam sterilizers were placed under their control at the same time. The subordinate staff employed heretofore was retained, but their training has undergone very considerable improvement.  Every sub- inspector in charge of a disinfection gang was in possession of a written copy of instructions and orders for guidance in disinfection work.  The greatest stress was laid upon these orders which the staff were required to carry out in their daily work as fully and completely as possible. The closest attention was paid to the mixing of the acidulated solution and phenyle with the correct quantity of water. Every bucket and measure glass was carefully marked off to ensure that the solutions used should be of the right strength. Frequent surprise visits were paid while the gangs were at work disinfecting, and samples collected of the solution in use which were afterwards analysed and tested at the Central Labora- tory, and in only a few instances was the solution found to be of a strength differing from that ordered for use. The District officers and Medical officers threw themselves heartily into the work, moving about from gang to gang to see that orders were properly carried out, and exercised the very closest supervision over the sub-inspectors in charge of gangs. Attention was given to minute
71 details in the modus operandi of disinfecting the various kinds of in- fected houses and dwellings met with in the course of plague work. The officers did not confine themselves to precept but taught also by example, showing the workman how to go to work and infusing him with a belief in the utility of his labours. It was soon found that considerable improvement had been made in the methods of disinfection. As disinfection was becoming to be appre- ciated in some parts of the city, the District officers arranged for those who asked, being provided with disinfectants and paraphernalia for use, in cases where patients had not been removed to hospitals; and this was done under the supervision of the plague staff, who saw that the disinfectants were properly applied. District officers resorted freely to general disinfection of houses where rats were found or where several plague or suspicious cases occurred. It was found advisable to instruct the gangs not to disinfect walls and roofs out of a man's reach except places that may have served for the reception of infected materials. Brushes were introduced for the first time and the method of using them to the greatest advantage was carefully studied and acted upon. Goa brooms were used for soft mud floors and walls. In the majority of cases the people preferred to wait until the disinfection of their dwellings had been completed and to re-occupy them at once in place of going to camp. In this they studied their own convenience. The promptitude with which disinfection has been carried out is a noticeable feature amongst the improvements effected in disinfection this year. Only a very small proportion of houses were disinfected as late as 24 hours after death. The causes of delay were one by one examined, steps were taken to overcome them, and the endeavours made in this direction met with very considerable success. There will always remain, however, some causes of delay which cannot be helped. District and Medical officers were instructed to watch and report upon the causes of re-infection of places that had been disinfected. In such a matter the difficulty of finding reliable evidence was very great. Dwellings were found re-infected shortly after disinfection owing to importation of fresh cases of plague. This was a common experience in boarding houses and of constant oc- currence in Wari Bunder district, where there are a large number of such houses. The delays in disinfection of the houses of Parsis and Mahomedans alluded to in former annual reports have been to a considerable extent minimised by the efforts of the District officers, more especially in A Ward and the Central District. The Secretary of the Parsee Pun- chayat Mr. Modi has given invaluable assistance in this direction, and Parsee houses are now disinfected within 24 hours of death. In the Central District the sectional Medical officers and the handful of volunteers who still continued to work nobly aided the District officers in their successful efforts to introduce early disinfection in place of the delays
72 which had been for so long countenanced with regard to the Ziarat and other religious ceremonies. Great credit is due to all concerned in the successful accomplishment of this difficult work. As in the previous year so in the present the District officers de- voted attention to the disinfection of empty houses as well as of those with notoriously bad records before the epidemic proper commenced. In many cases the people showed they believed in this precautionary measure of disinfection. Very little tile-turning was done in the City proper, but in F and G Wards and Wari Bunder where single storied or only ground floor structures were met with, a certain amount was done. There is a consensus of opinion amongst the officers that disinfection of a whole house gives better results than disinfection merely of the case room or adjoining rooms. In large chawls, too, disinfection of one or more flats is held to be more worthy of adoption than disinfection of single rooms. There are numerous examples showing that the results of whole house or whole floor disinfection are such as to justify the opinions held on the subject-in the case of badly infected houses. In the course of disinfection work rats were frequently found. They were sent to the Government Research Laboratory and in nearly every case where it was possible to make an examination of the body, plague bacilli were discovered in the corpses of these rodents. Some- times they were found in the mattresses or bed clothes, at others lying dead in the cooking utensils. Numbers were discovered in lofts and in the kitchens of the better class of houses; also in many parts of the City on the roads and gullies. It is almost needless to say that wherever dead rats were found the people suffered from plague. In reviewing the disinfection work during the late epidemic it may be said that the District officers and special Medical officers devoted them- selves to attaining the utmost thoroughness and efficiency in the work as well as to improving and training the staff engaged upon it, and that their endeavours met with very considerable success, but it was felt that more Staff Corps Officers were wanted for supervising the disinfection work. The measure was pushed rigorously and every dwelling place where a death had occurred, the cause of which could not be determined, not to be due to plague was disinfected with a promptitude and efficiency hitherto unknown and under the closest possible supervision, the necessity for which became more and more apparent as the work increased. Disin- fection was on the whole unpopular, but this was due mostly to the incon- venience it caused to the people whose houses had to be disinfected and their clothing collected and despatched to the sterilizers. The belief in the utility of the measure has certainly increased, mainly owing to the tact, patience and ability which the District officers have shown in con- vincing the people and inducing them to carry out this measure, by the exercise of their own free will and as a consequence of their appreciating
73 and understanding the benefits to be anticipated therefrom. The resistance to the measure was of a passive kind and the ensuing friction of the mildest possible type, in comparison with the experience of past years; and with the advent of the District officer accompanied perhaps by a trustworthy volunteer all trouble ceased and the inevitable orders would be accepted with good will. Dr. Cayley was in charge of the Central Laboratory for the manu- facture of the Perchloride of Mercury Solution, which continued to be used in disinfection work. He reports as follows:- To THE PERSONAL ASSISTANT TO THE MUNICIPAL COMMISSIONER. SIR,-I have the honor to forward my report on the Administration of the Laboratory for the preparation of the Perchloride of Mercury Solution during the year ending 31st May 1901. For the first 8 months of the year, namely from June 1st 1900 to January 31st 1901, no alteration was made in the strength of the disinfectant from that in use during the preceding two years. Since February 1st 1901, the strength of the concentrated solution prepared at Foras Road has been reduced, so that, while the same measures and buckets are being used, diluted solutions have now a strength of 1 in 950 instead of 1 in 760. The quantities of Perchloride of Mercury, etc., used in the preparation of the original concentrated solution and of the weaker concentrated solution, as at present prepared, are given below:- (a) Original solution.- To each jar having a nominal capacity of 2\1/2\ gallons, i.e., 20 pint were added- 2\1/2\ lbs. of Perchloride of Mercury. 4 pints of Hydrochloric Acid. 2  gallons of Water. Each jar of this concentrated solution had a strength of 1 part of Perchloride of Mercury in 10, and the diluted solutions as used in the districts had a theore- tical strength of 1 in 760. (b) Solution as prepared since February 1st 1901.- To each jar having a nominal capacity of 2\1/2\ gallons, i.e., 20 pints are added- 2lbs. of Perchloride of Mercury. 3 pints of Hydrochloric Acid. 21/8 gallons of Water. This solution has a strength of 1 in 121/2 of Perchloride of Mercury, and the diluted solution as used in the Districts has a theoretical strength of 1 in 950. To both these concentrated solutions a sufficient quantity of a watery solu- tion of Methylene Blue is added to give it a distinct blue colour. Thus, each jar of the reduced solution contains 1/2lb. of Perchloride of Mercury and 1 pint of Hydro- 19
74 chloric Acid less than was contained in each jar of the original solution. This has effected a considerable reduction in the cost of the disinfectants, as will be seen from the following figures. The average cost of the Perchloride of Mercury was Rs. 2-4-0 per lb; and of the Hydrochloric Acid As. 4 per pint. Thus, on each jar there is a saving of Rs. 1-2-0 on the Perchloride and of As. 4 on the Hydrochloric Acid used, making a total of Rs. 1-6-0 on each jar. In the month of March 911 jars were supplied to the different districts and the saving in this month alone was Rs. 1,251. During the year 107 cwt. of Perchloride of Mercury were supplied at a cost of Rs. 25,982 and 1,006 jars of Hydrochloric Acid, at a cost of Rs. 5,520. Total Cost-Perchloride of Mercury. Rs. 25,982 Hydrochloric Acid. " 5,520  " 31,502 5,503 jars of the concentrated solution were supplied during the year, thus the cost of the Perchloride and Hydrochloric Acid in each jar was Rs. 5-11-2. To this must be added the cost of the Methylene Blue, labels, etc., so that the cost of each jar was practically Rs. 6. The wages of the staff employed for the year came to Rs. 2,383. The cost of the 5,503 jars at Rs. 6 each amounted to Rs. 33,018. Total Wages Rs. 2,383 Jars " 33,018  " 35,401 which has approximately been the cost of the preparation of the Disinfectant for the 12 months ending May 31st, 1901. During the year samples of the diluted solutions used in the districts were analysed on several occasions. As a rule, these samples were found to be of full strength. In the few cases where they were found to be below strength the District officers concerned were communicated with, and the necessary inquiries were made. During the year the instructions which had been drawn up to prevent mercurial poisoning were rigidly carried out, and as a result only one cooly had to go on sick leave from this cause, and he was only absent for fourteen days. Most of the coolies had at one time or another to be put on outdoor work such as carrying messages, and were stopped from working with the Perchloride, as they had begun to shew symptoms of mercurial poisoning. These steps produced the desired results and the men recovered without having to go on sick leave. Several of the coolies suffered from inflamed eyes and sore throats from the acid fumes, but the Chlorate of Potash Gargle and Astringent Eye Lotions provided for their use prevented the symptoms from being severe. At the end of the year the health of all the employes was good. Tables are attached showing the number of jars of the concentrated solution supplied to each District during the year and the number of jars issued in each month.

?76 Sterilizers. The Sterilizers of which there are four in the City are located at Modikhana, Babulla Tank, Northbrook Gardens and the Arthur Road Hospital. It was one of the chief duties of sub-inspectors to attend to the collecting and despatching of infected clothing to the nearest sterilizers. The people passively resisted this measure and used to hide their kit whenever they could, it was not therefore easy in every case to gather from the people all the clothing that should have been sent. Experience showed in this instance as in so many others the absolute necessity for efficient supervision over disinfection work. The amount of clothing sent to the sterilisers during the year has of course exceeded in quantity any sent in previous years. The North- brook Gardens Sterilizer which was in the heart of the City bore the brunt of the work. This machine was practically in use from morning till nightfall from day to day without a stop except for cleanings and repairings which took place periodically. The process of disinfection at the steam sterilizers received the careful attention of the District officers and the special Medical officers, who paid frequent and constant visits to see that the operation was correctly performed. The thermometers supplied were used to check the process and to see that steam was kept at a temperature of not less than 230 F. The clothing, bedding, and other articles sent for disinfection were received at the sterilizing station by a subordinate who issued a receipt for the number of bundles received. The hand cart or open ambulance frame which was used to convey the clothing was there and then disinfected in every case before the return journey was made with the disinfected kit. The subjoined statement shows the amount of clothing disinfected at the Northbrook Gardens sterilizer which was opened for work on the 25th January 1900.

?77 It will be seen from the statement, how the amount of clothing sterilized, increased in the month of September 1900 due to the fact that orders were issued making disinfection the measure of primary importance just at that time. The registers kept at the other three sterilizers give corresponding results. Every effort was made by persuasion and tact to overcome the prejudices of the people with regard to the sterilizers and besides to popularize disinfection as far as possible. They were taught the necessity for prompt disinfection, their wishes were consulted, their customs respected, and for any losses incurred they were fully recompensed. It may be said that on the whole disinfection has been carried out in strictest conformity with the orders, and that very little room remains for improvement except in the direction of European supervision; the more there is of this, the greater the efficiency. It is impossible to shut one's eyes to the fact that the subordinates employed are open to temptations of all kinds, to bribery, to theft, etc., which they might find irresistible in the absence of supervising officers. Mr. Hewett, Assistant Executive Engineer, Mechanical Branch, reports upon the steam sterilizers as follows:- So far as my observations go the process is carried out with a fair amount of efficiency, but I am still of opinion that the operation, to make it absolutely reliable, should be performed under the close personal supervision of a subordinate Medical officer. This was my opinion at the beginning of operations, but it was objected to on the score of expense. The whole question resolves itself into this-Has steam at a temperature of not less than 230 F. enveloped every fibre of the articles placed in the chamber ? A thermometer is reliable for ascertaining whether this has been the case only when intelligently used. For instance, I have seen one placed with its stem carefully embedded in the clothing, while the bulb was placed outwards with scarcely any covering at all. A really intelligent supervisor would only require a thermometer to occasionally check his powers of observation, for he would very soon become acquainted with the time required to thoroughly sterilize different classes of materials. Once that knowledge is gained, he would, by carefully noting what was put into cradles and seeing that they were packed as loosely as possible, be practically sure of the results. With regard to the "Bowman" sterilizer as used at the Babula Tank and Arthur Road Hospital Mr. Hewett goes on to point out, that "the means adopted to ensure a thorough circulation of steam were defective and that to obtain reliable results the articles to be sterilized must remain in contact with the steam for a long period." On the "Equifex" sterilizers, now in use at the Northbrook Gardens and Modikhana, his opinion is that it is " undoubtedly a very reliable apparatus when properly used." Mr. Hewett concludes by saying that he thinks "a large measure of success is obtained even with unskilled supervision." These sterilizers as already stated were placed in charge of English Medical officers who have given attention to essential points, but as they have to supervise all disinfection work it was necessary to commit the working of the steriliz- 20
78 ers to laymen who have been taught to supervise in their absence. The excellent arrangements made by Mr. Hewett enabled the work of disin- fection at the sterilizers to be carried out without a stop or hitch. Capt. Smith, District Officer, C Ward, gives his experience of the work of disinfection in his Ward, which was very heavy indeed, in the following report:- At the beginning of this year this measure was not what might be called one of the measures of primary importance in fighting the plague as compared with inoculation, removal of sick to hospital, evacuation of houses, and segregation of contacts and evicts. Since the alteration and modification in plague measures it has become the most important measure of all. Moreover, the way in which disinfection was carried out was completely altered. The previous method was to pump or throw dilute solution of Perchloride of Mercury all over the floor walls and ceilings, cupboards, etc. of the place that was being disinfected. This method was replaced by the following:-The walls were wetted with dilute Perchoride of Mercury solution and were well brushed by the coolies of the disinfecting gang as high as they could reach. The walls were then well flushed with dilute solution. The floor was also scrubbed in a similar manner and all lofts, cupboards and places which might have held infected materials, etc., were also done. The above is the general outline of the procedure followed. The disinfection, in my openion, was faulty in some respects and did not go far enough. The ceilings and upper part of the walls were left undone and this was, I consider, a most serious defect in the present method. I think that the present method of disinfection with brushes should be continued but that the ceilings and the whole of the walls of rooms, etc., should be well flushed with the Perchloride of Mercury solution. There is no doubt that rats, etc., crawl about in the ceilings and on the walls, and leave a great deal of the plague poison about these places, and as they are not touched by the present method of disinfection there is no doubt in my mind but that a very large amount of infectious matter is left in rooms that have been thoroughly disin- fected according to present methods. I consider disinfection on the lines I have proposed a measure of the very greatest importance as the Perchloride solution undoubtedly destroys all plague poison within its reach and so in cases of infected rooms, etc., removes the cause of infection. I would point out in connection with this subject that the majority of the people in this Ward sleep on the ground; and the ground naturally is the place where rats, etc., run about, and they also crawl about over the beddings, clothes, etc. of the people. Consequently the people are very liable to catch the disease from their close proximity to the infected ground, and also from the way they have of wrapping themselves up in their infected cloth- ing and breathing air which has chiefly filtered through their infected bed clothes such as blankets, rezais, etc. Disinfection by Perchloride of mercury undoubtedly reduces the chances of infection from the ground to a minimum if it does not altogether destroy the plague poison; and the disinfection of beddings, clothes, etc., through the agency of the sterilizers effectually destroys any plague poison that may have lodged in them. The present system of disinfection, I have reason to believe, does not meet with ap- proval in certain quarters, but I think, on the whole, nobody can possibly expect the absolute scientific accuracy, etc. of the laboratory, hospital, etc., in measures which are on such a very large and extensive scale, and where the cost of the aforesaid measures is an item that enters into the calculation. In one direction as regards disinfection, an improvement could be made so as to ensure the best results, and that is, in future epidemics, it will be absolutely necessary to have at least
79 four if not five assistant district officers attached to this Ward to supervise the disin- fection work only, as the sub-inspectors in charge of the disinfecting gangs require a great deal of supervision to see that they carry out their orders properly. During the last epidemic I was left by myself for a long time, and later only had one assistant and between us we were not able to exercise proper supervision over all the gangs. A great many of these sub-inspectors are of the rolling stone variety and considering the small amount of pay that they receive it is not to be wondered at if they succumb to the various temptations they are exposed to while at work. There is no doubt whatsoever that they are offered a great deal of money by the people at large, especially amongst the better classes, who do this so as to escape having their houses, etc., disinfected. It is for this reason I consider that there should be so many extra Staff Corps officers appointed to this Ward as soon as the plague commences in epidemic form. I might mention that I personally was offered rupees five by a man (well-to-do) living in Kalbadevie Road if I would leave one small room alone and not disinfect it. If they would do it to me it stands to reason that they would not be so backward in dealing with men who, as a rule, are very hard-up and who would perhaps have very few scruples in accepting something to augment their pay. They require a great deal of close supervision, and if this is done I have no doubt whatsoever but that the results of disinfection will greatly improve. Disinfection in this Ward has been carried out as carefully as possible and I have been constantly on the move amongst the gangs and also the rooms that had already been done. In cases where the work was not done to my satisfaction it was done again. Amongst the richer classes a certain amount of difficulty was encountered. As a rule, friends and neighbours used to come round and try and persuade us that no plague deaths had occurred in the places put down for disinfection. They also come and interfere with the gangs and say they are not to do this or that, etc. On a few occasions the people have assaulted the gangs when they first went to disinfect houses, and also while they were at work. The disinfecting staff are quite at the mercy of the people as the only remedy they have is to charge their opponents with common assault, as any one assaulting any of the plague staff excepting gazetted officers and permanent Municipal servants cannot be charged with assaulting a "public officer" in the execution of his duty. I certainly consider that the subordinate plague staff ought to have some protection against such assaults Amongst the lower classes of Hindus there was very little difficulty in carrying out disinfection. Very great care was taken in selecting men for the disinfecting gangs so as to avoid having men of low caste, whose presence in their rooms the people objected to very much. They consist chiefly of Pardesi Brahmins, Marathas and a few Mahomedans. The latter are not used in Hindu houses and usually look after the cart outside while operations are in progress. I might mention that to the present time in spite of all precautions to have only good caste men in the gangs a great many Hindus object to the gangs going into their rooms on the score that they are all low caste men. When, however, matters are explained to them regarding the castes of the men employed they usually allow disinfection to proceed without further objection. In some cases, but not many, the people have asked to be allowed to carry out the disinfection with their own men and this has always been allowed with the result that the disinfection is promptly carried out. At other times the gangs are requested to come at a parti- cular time and their wishes are always met in this respect, too. For instance, the proprietor of a shop who carried on business all day long and to whom it would have meant a very serious loss if the place had been disinfected when the gang
80 went round in the day-time, was allowed to have his premises disinfected at 21 o'clock (9 p.m.) the same evening. It has been the custom in this Ward to meet the wishes of the people as far as it was consistent with carrying out the rules properly. The result has been that every thing has worked most uncommonly, smoothly and practically no complaints have been received. Amongst the difficulties encountered in carrying out disinfection properly the following reported by Dr. Cama, Kumbharwada section, are interesting and throw a side light showing why in many cases ordi- nary methods of disinfection do not show good results:- A few difficulties were met with in this section which necessitated action as regards disinfection being suspended. Whole house disinfection was not carried out owing to the great strain of work thrown on the staff-at a time it would have been most beneficial. In most cases, however, action was taken within 24 hours, but it had to be deferred when a certificate was promised and action was taken when the people failed to produce it. Sometimes great delay took place owing to the certificate having been sent to the Health Officer or Municipal Com- missioner, and some times inquiry into the case so as to verify it correctly delayed disinfection. In this section, in houses in which patients were left for treatment, action had almost invariably to be delayed, as it was quite impossible for the people to find another room to live in, and to allow the patient to remain isolated in the room. Owing to the relatives, etc., living in the same room as the patient or patients there is no doubt but that a great many people were infected in conse- quence. They, however, almost invariably moved their kit to other rooms and there was nothing to prevent them and their friends and neighbours going in and out of the patient's room. It is very difficult to put any restrictions on this and the only thing has been to take all the kit from all the adjoining rooms or often all the rooms on the floor and send it to be sterilized, and order all the rooms to be disinfected. Even this often could not be wholly done as the gangs very often found sick people in the rooms put down for disinfection so action had to be deferred in these cases. In 159, Northbrook Street when the first case occurred the relatives removed all the kit from this room to the adjoining one. Within three or four days cases occurred in other rooms. Kits from all these rooms were sterilized and the rooms free from cases were disinfected. When the patients thus isolated either recovered or died and the gangs came to disinfect these rooms other sick persons were found in the rooms that had been previously disinfected. This kind of thing was repeated during the epidemic. Houses like this require to be disinfected from roof to floor and most thoroughly too. Very few instances of whole house disinfection occurred in this Ward owing to the very great stress of work and the very rapid increase in the figures of the people attacked. Dr. Britto remarks as follows:- Owing to constantly recurring cases in houses and rooms in the Market sec- tion in spite of frequent disinfection, certain experimental disinfections were carried out with a stronger solution of Perchloride of Mercury at my recom- mendation. Hence the most infected houses in which plague may be said to be endemic were chosen for this experimental disinfection. The solution used was of double the standard strength. The first house was Patackwady Dookergally No. 1-7-The plague history of the house during the epidemic was as follows:-Plague cases occurred on 12th, 16th, 19th, 21st, 22nd, 23rd, 25th, 30th January 1901. I asked the
81 District Officer, Captain Smith, to disinfect the whole house with a solution of Perchloride of Mercury, 1 in 500. The house was fully disinfected with this solution on 2nd February and completed on 12th idem. In all, twenty- nine rooms were disinfected. The people were induced to go to camp; but only a few availed themselves of camp accommodation, while the rest preferred to re-occupy the house after disinfection. No cases were observed in that house until the 13th March, that is, twenty-eight days after disinfection. After this, though the house was tenanted, no cases showed themselves. A death from plague was reported as having occurred in this house on 21st March. From inquiry it was found out that the case was imported into this house from Parel; but no more cases were noted until 1st April. This case occurred in the same room in which the case of 13th March took place, the woman being the step-mother. Then on 7th April there were 2 cases of mother and child. The child was removed to Dongri, where she died. These people had been living on the ground floor since the particular disinfection. Here we have an instance in which the child was first attacked and the mother was in attendance. Four days after, the mother con- tracted the disease and died. The Second House which was similarly treated was Picquet Road, No. 35-1.- The plague history was as follows :-Plague deaths occurred on 15th October 4th, and 13th November 1900, 23rd, 26th and 28th January 1901. Owing to the constant recurring of cases, the house was vacated on 28th January and the people removed to camp. A few people, about 3 families, remained in the house. Ten cases occurred in camp between the 31st January and 9th February, sufficiently indicating that they were infected prior to being removed to camp. This may afford an illustration of the necessity of vacation of badly infected houses. At first individual rooms were disinfected with solution of Perchloride of Mercury, 1 in 1,000. On the 18th February one of the persons yet resident in the house died of plague. It was then suggested by me to the District Officer, Captain Smith, that this house be taken up for experimental disinfection with a solution of 1 in 500. The remaining people were advised to take camp accommoda- tion. Two families did not go into camp. The whole house, twenty-eight rooms in all, was thoroughly disinfected on 19th February. Special precautions were taken in this house to completely and thoroughly saturate the partitions and floors as they were of dung. It is a notable fact that in houses with wattle and daub partitions and thickly laid dung floors a large quantity of solution is needed before any impression can be made on them. At the same time it must also be remem- bered that the solution is acted upon by contact with dung floors and partitions. No cases were observed in this house until 17th March, when a case was brought to this house from house No. 23, Picquet Road. On the 19th March the house was again fully re-occupied. The first case after re-occupation occurred on the 2nd April and the next on the 4th idem. After this, there were two cases on the 13th May, one on 15th and one on 19th idem. The third house similarly experimented on, was 155/1, Lohar Street- The plague history is as follows :-Plague cases occurred on 10th October 1900; 25th and 27th January; 3rd, 4th, 6th, 7th, 9th, 10th, 13th, and 17th February, and 1st March 1901. The disinfection in this instance was carried out personally by the District Officer, Assistant District Officer and myself, the solution being made up by the District Officer and the Assistant District Officer. The whole house was deserted with the exception of four families, who were turned out of their rooms, and put into other rooms until disinfection of their rooms were completed. The solution used was 1 in 500. The disinfection was commenced on 23rd March and completed on 25th March, except a few locked 21
82 rooms, which were left disinfected until the occupants were sent for. The locked rooms were disinfected on 2nd April. The total number of rooms disinfected was eighty-six. It may be noted that in all these cases, the whole room, in addition to being brushed, was swelled out with the solution. No cases have occurred in this house, though it is now fully tenanted. The fourth house which was taken up for experimental disinfection was house No. 23/25, Patackwadi Dooker Gully.-The plague history of the house is as foll- ows:-Cases occurred on 19th September, and 19th October 1900; 22nd and 31st January; 4th, 5th, 13th, 17th, and 18th February; 5th and 17th March 1901. The solution used was 1 in 500. The mixing of the solution and the disin- fection was done under the personal supervision of the District Officer and Assistant District Officer. I was also present to see details. The disinfection commenced on 22nd March, continued on 25th idem, and the locked rooms were finished on 11th April. The tenants of the house in some cases left it, others took camp accommodation, while some of them occupied a few rooms. In all thirty-eight rooms were thoroughly scrubbed and swelled out. While the ground floor was being disinfected a number of dead rats in a state of dessication were found lying in a corner near the staircase. This probably explains the recurrence of plague in this house. No cases of plague have occurred, since the house was re-occupied in April. The results obtained from this disinfection have been encouraging and proved conclusively that a double strength solution is desirable if any appreciable result is to be obtained. In all these houses which were of the worst type, and in which the plague history in previous years has been very bad, this disinfection with a double strength solution was able to stay the progress of the disease for a period of 28 and 30 days respectively. In deducing conclusions, it must be borne in mind that there are certain points which require careful observation and further elucidation. These are infection from the surroundings by means of human agency and re-infection of houses by infected rats. It must be borne in mind however that it is quite probable the good results of the disinfection above mentioned were due to the particular attention devoted to these special cases of disinfection by the District Officers and Medical staff who were present and who collectively super- vised the work. Capt. Smith goes on to say:- As regards difficulties experienced in the case of Parsis three days have to be given on account of religious ceremonies in the room in which the case occurred. They will as a rule allow disinfectants to be used in the room except in the space where the body has been lying. But as a rule the proper thorough disinfection is not carried out until three days after the death has occurred. An exception to this rule is in the cases of families who carry out the necessary religious ceremonies in the fire temple. These cases are done about 24 hours afterwards. As regards the Mahomedans where a house is occupied they almost invariably claim what they call a three days' "Ziarat. " I really cannot imagine how they were ever allowed in the first instance to start such a custom as this which means the deferring of disinfection for three days. The real meaning of the "Ziarat" is the prayers read on the morning of the third day after the death, and there is as far as I know no real objection to the disinfection being carried out within 24 hours of death. I might mention that in Aden the houses and rooms are used to be
83 done within few hours of death. Aden being a town inhabited almost entirely by Mahomedans such as Somalis, Arabs, etc., no objections were ever raised there that I know of. In Abdul Rehman Street, No. 36, there is a Jamatkhana and this was used as a sort of hospital and dumping ground for all cases in which the relatives did not want their houses known. Whenever a patient died, etc., there was always trouble about the disinfection, as various loafers used to come and make themselves very objectionable and often used to push up against and even strike the sub-ins- pectors and men of the gangs. On one occasion one man was more than usually violent and at the request of the sub-inspector, Mr. Haji Kassum Yusuf, J. P., intervened and stopped all further riotous behaviour on the part of these loafers. Locked houses and rooms also delayed disinfection in a great many cases. When I first came we could always get policemen on requisition who used to stand by while the houses were opened and disinfected. A most remarkable fact was that the presence of a policeman at the door seemed to act as a sort of lodestone to the occupants. For when the gangs used to go to these rooms in the first instance they were always told that the occupants had gone off to their native country, but as soon as a policeman appeared on the spot the occupants used to turn up in a most mysterious way and open the door of the room. The use of police, however, was stopped by the Police Commissioner with the result that the number of locked houses increased, and great difficulty was experienced in gett- ing these rooms done. As a careful watch was always kept and as soon as the gang was seen coming towards the house the owners used to lock the rooms and go off into the next room, house or another floor. Finally we had to resort to the system in vogue in Central District and A Ward of putting our own locks on, so that the people could not get into their rooms without coming to us first. The sterilizers have been used to a very large extent indeed. All articles of bedding, blankets, clothes, etc., were sent to them for sterilization. All clothing, bedding, etc., from the rooms in which sick people were kept were sent to the ste- rilizers every other day and this undoubtedly contributed to the prevention of the spread of infection amongst the people living with and tending the sick. The use of sterilizers has minimised the trouble and opposition formerly expe- rienced in carrying out disinfecting operations as the people now a days have to a very large extent got over their fear that all their kit was going to be destroyed and damaged. I have endeavoured as far as I could to always get one or more of the males of the family to whom the kit belonged to accompany the things to the sterilizer and back again, and this has resulted in the people now entrusting their things without any great objection to the members of the disinfecting staff. This is a great step forward I consider. Also to a certain extent some of the people owing to our staff constantly impressing on them the benefits of the sterilizers have begun to realize the benefits of clothes, etc., being disinfected in this way and the staff have often been assisted by neighbours coming forward and asking the parties concerned why they were objecting as no harm would be done to their things. There is no doubt whatsoever but that these sterilizers have been a very great boon to the city and have assisted enormously in arresting the spread of plague. One of the greatest benefits of disinfection is that not only are the rooms, etc., well disinfected, but the rooms are thoroughly cleaned in the process and there is no doubt that there is less chance of plague germs flourishing in thoroughly cleaned rooms than in dirty, filthy rooms. As this process is going on constantly there is no doubt that the houses in the city are on the whole
84 being kept very much cleaner than formerly. I might mention that while I was in charge of A Ward in March 1901 it was reported to me that some Goanese in Frere Road had said to the subordinate staff "You, give us some bother but you do clean our rooms well for us." Disinfection as carried out now in Bombay under the careful supervision of Staff Corps officers is a most effective measure, but I doubt, much of it would be so effective if handed over to non-military control. Dr. Fazl Ahmad reports upon the disinfection work carried out amongst the Mahomedans of Umarkhadi and Chukla sections as follows:- All orders on the subject of disinfection were complied with without a single excep- tion. Every endeavour was made to take prompt action and secure ready disinfection. This could easily be done in Hindoo houses which were almost all flushed within 24 hours. Ziarat Ceremony-The disinfection of Mahomedan houses was not an easy one. The "Ziarat" ceremony came in the way of prompt action being taken in these houses and we had to wait for three days before the disinfection could be taken in hand the "Ziarat" being a religious ceremony, observed throughout the Mahomedan world, was unavoidably recognised by the Plague Authorities in the last three epidemics. Accordingly three days' time was allowed in case of every Mahomedan house to complete the ceremony, and then the disinfection was carried out. This had become an established rule of practice in our dealings with the Maho- medan houses, and Mahomedans looked on this allowance as a right. An attempt has of late been made to restrict the time-honoured practice, though not to eliminate it altogether. Conservatism as is generally admitted reigns no where perhaps more supremely than among the Indian Mussalmans and the religious susceptibilities of these people are very acute, over and above this, their staunch belief in fate and weakness of human devices make the interfer- ence in the Ziarat still more serious. Taking all these circumstances into consideration the question appeared to be delicate and one that required very skilful handling. Any rashness in this matter may defeat the purpose in view, and might be the cause of serious disturbance. We have been able to carry out the disinfection of some of the Mahomedan houses within 24 hours in the last two months. In every case the best and most benevolent intentions of the Government were fully explained, and it was plainly made known to the parties concerned that it was in the interest of their own welfare that an early disinfection was proposed. The progress in this direction would be gradual, and slow, and in time we may be able to disinfect more and more of Mahomedan houses soon after the occurrence of deaths, but an immediate disinfection of respectable and Parda-houses will ever remain a difficulty. Many improve- ments were introduced in the procedure and details of disinfection during the year under report. The disinfection of kit by steam sterilization was very freely done. This part of the disinfection received its due importance in this year for the first time. In order to avoid disinfection the people tried every sort of trick, they could think of, and did their best to secrete the kit. The work was very hard in the beginning, but the steady and judicious way in which the District Officer pushed this work on, week after week and the persuasive policy pursued throughout, smoothed the way to a large extent. In consequence the number of bundles disinfected in this year exceeded those in the past 3 years put together. Considerable attention has been paid to the minute details and the modus operandi of the process of disinfection, especially, since the arrival of Dr. Fraser in this District. The process has been divided into a number of stages and instructions and lines of action definitely and distinctly laid down for the various steps and stages. These were fully explained and practically demonstrated to the gangs of our sections by the Doctor himself. Thus the disinfection became methodical and more like a scientific operation than it used to be. The use of phenyle and carbolic powder was very much objected to in several instances. Most of the very ignorant people have been given to understand that the odour of phenyle or carbolic powder is in itself a source of many diseases. Some of them hated the smell of these
85 substances. They objected to allowing the disinfection on the ground that phenyle would be surely used and would certainly do them harm. In all these cases they were satisfied, that no phenyle or carbolic or any other deodorant would be made use of in disinfection of their houses. The objection, slight, as it appears was at times very serious. It is a remnant of the earliest mis-representations about the aims and objects of the plague measures by self- interested practitioners and misguided leaders. It had taken such a strong hold on the minds of ignorant masses, that although every endeavour has been made during the last three years to eradicate it complete success has not yet been achieved. These difficulties themselves presented chiefly in Mahomedan houses, and as is well known the Central district is the great Mahomedan district in Bombay, the Hindoos form only a small minority. They also share the feelings and opinions of their neighbours the Mahomedans. Hindoos also came forward with similar objections in a few instances, but they were much more easily satisfied. Captain Lockhart Mure explains how delay in disinfecting Parsee houses was overcome with the assistance of the Parsee Punchayat, and there is no doubt that the Secretary of the Punchayat has once again afforded very valuable aid in removing the few difficulties that have beset disinfection operations in A Ward he states:- I have never had any difficulty in carrying out the standing orders with regard to disinfection, quite the reverse. Many people have asked me to disinfect more than was necessary. My procedure has generally been to get one of the residents to be present during the disinfection, and when they see that no damage has been done they are very often not only willing but eager to have the whole place done. When I took over charge of the district I found that houses, in which Parsi deaths had taken place, were not disinfected for four days afterwards. I thought this was a most dangerous proceeding and did away entirely with the value of disinfection as after four days if no case has taken place, I do not think any likely to occur. I consulted the Parsi Punchayat as to what means they could devise to remedy this evil, at the same time pointing out that I in no way wished to interfere with their religious observances. As a result, the Punchayat placed the services of two Parsi disinfectors at my disposal and since then the houses have been disinfected at once and the danger consequently removed. I place this on record as I consider that the Punchayat deserve the greatest of praise for the liberal-minded view they took of the question, and also for the prompt manner in which they overcame the difficulty. Another question that arose was with regard to the Mahomedans at Colaba. They wished to postpone disinfection for three days on account of their " Ziarat" but with the assistance of Khan Saheb Farid-ud-din this difficulty was at once bridged over. I have found that the people have been very good in giving up kit to be sterilized, and I do not think that much was secreted. Capt. Boileau comments on the disinfection of dwellings with the results attendant thereon as follows:- Disinfection as a means of arresting plague would, I have no doubt could it be carried out to perfection, have an excellent effect but the people-all classes alike (and the higher the class the greater the dislike)-have the greatest abhorrence of disinfection and will put themselves and their friends to the greatest inconvenience and resort to all kinds of sub- terfuge to escape from it. At the same time the resistance offered is passive and takes the form of in most cases clearing the room completely of all important articles belonging to the patient and leaving only one or two old rags, etc., which are only fit to be burnt. They usually place the clothing, bedding, etc., in an adjoining or in the opposite room-whence they extract it after much cross-questioning and threats of disinfection of the adjoining rooms. Of course this is not always the case, but it certainly occurs very frequently and no doubt, a lot of clothing escapes sterilizing. There is no doubt, however, that in the cases of rat disin- 22
86 fection where there is a crop of cases-and where as ofoldone was able to clear out a chawl and thoroughly cleanse it-disinfection plays a distinct part in checking plague and is most efficacious. Take the case of 478, Delisle Road, where seven cases occurred in the com- mencement of the epidemic within three days. I cleared out the people and thoroughly disinfected the place and tile turned it, and have not had a single case of plague in it since. Similar results were obtained in 1243, Parel village, 67 and 57, Suparibag Road, 52 and 72, Curry Road. As to the efficacy of individual disinfection of rooms such as refers to imported cases and cases occurring singly, I am unable to say whether it has in any way checked or altered the course of epidemic-there is no proof either way. In isolated cases the disinfection is postponed until recovery or death of patient and this means some times (generally in fact) a long period extending often over 15 days in which the tenement remains undisinfected and yet it is a fact, out of 491 such isolated cases only 39 contacts out of the many people who see the patient, were discovered to have contracted plague. Lieut. Shakespeare states that disinfection was always carried out according to the standing orders which have been found to work well and smoothly. He goes on to say:- Disinfection as at present carried out shows the best results. When a house, in which four or five cases have occurred in rapid succession, is taken in hand and disinfected from top to bottom. Very seldom does plague assume epidemic proportions in any house thus treated; whereas the process of disinfecting single rooms as cases occur is endless and means that the people dodge in and out of the various rooms spreading the disease. The necessity for the closest supervision of disinfection work in particular is made apparent in the subjoined report of the late Lieut. Carpenter who was in charge of the district. He states:- It may be of interest to mention that last week an attempt was made to bribe me. A death had occurred in a room used for business purposes by Mahomedans on the first floor (front) of 19-21, Nagdevi Street. I heard it was plague. Anticipating possible trouble, I went with a sub-inspector and gang to the house. As usual in such rooms, the floor was practi- cally covered with mattresses and pillows on which men sat to write and transact business. Every article of kit was taken by me. The owners, though quite quiet, were very unwilling to let the kit go, and repeatedly asked for 'Mehrbani.' They then told me that the man had died in the adjoining room, which communicated, as a reason for my not taking their kits. Eventually one man, after consultation with the others, approached me with a view to a little quiet conversation outside. I saw by his gestures what he meant, but told him to say what he had to say in the room, and explained clearly that those games would not pay him. The matter was then dropped. From a short conversation I had with an old Mahomedan and another downstairs, both evidently connected with the men upstairs, it transpired that they thought I was an "Inspector." I told them I was from a 'Pultan' and they seemed somewhat surprised. This belief of theirs might explain their behaviour. Had I not been present it is quite possible they might have tried the same thing on the inspector. To my own knowledge, one of my sub-inspectors was once offered Re. 1 when disinfect- ing a house. To induce him not to tell me that in a certain box I had overlooked there were a number of sarees (for sale). He reported the incident to me. The sarees in this case were not sterilized, as there was a possibility of their getting harm from the process. Lieut. Dalgliesh reports as follows:- No difficulty of any consequence was experienced in carrying out disinfection according to standing orders. I found that disinfection of entire houses was of use in checking plague, but in most cases breaking out again a month or two after the disinfec- tion had taken place. Many instances could be given from the office records where
87 disinfection has done good, but its effects only seem to be temporary. It was generally carried out within 12 hours of death, unless in the case of Mahomedans a delay of three days for performance of funeral ceremony was asked for. Examples where disinfection had good results:- 110/112, 1st Nowroji Hill, North.-Six cases of plague occurred on 15th and 16th February 1901;the whole house was disinfected on 16th idem. Two more cases occurred on 17th and 19th of the same month and the two floors on which they occurred were disinfected; since when no plague has occurred and only one death. 48/50, 1st Nowroji Hill, North.-Eight cases of plague occurred between 3rd and 9th March 1901. The whole house was disinfected on 12th idem; since when no cases have occurred. Many such examples could be quoted, but on the other hand a good many examples can be shown where disinfection has not had any good results:- 95/97, 1st Nowroji Hill, North.-There were twelve cases of plague between 29th January and 16th February. The house was disinfected on 16th February. Four more cases occurred between 17th and 27th February. The whole house was disinfected on 9th March. Another plague death occurred on 11th March, and still one more on 4th April 1901. 110, 2nd Nowroji Hill, North.-Two plague deaths occurred on 8th and 9th February. The whole house was disinfected on 9th February. Another plague death occur- red on 11th March, and three more subsequently on 7th and 10th April and 13th May 1901. I think that disinfection in combination with segregation is most effectual, but by it- self the effect is only temporary. Dr. Fraser, Special Medical Officer, Central District, makes the following report:- To increase the value of disinfection 1 was of opinion that certain changes were necessary for improvements in the general method of carrying out the actual work of disinfec- tion, such as the employment of lamps in dark ill-lit or unlit rooms while carrying out the disinfection of the same;the adoption of a definite method in the disinfection of places whereby not even a square inch of surface which ought to be disinfected would be missed; the accurate marking of all glasses and buckets used in disinfection so that the proper standard of strength (no more and no less) should be invariably main- tained; the duly impressing on those concerned that the two disinfectants used by us are different in constitution, that each has its own uses and that they are not to be used indifferently. The substitution of wooden for zinc buckets removed one very prolific source of error and difficulty in this matter. Finally thoroughness in the work itself was looked for. Another point which struck me as being essential was the training of an adequate staff of disinfectors to our improved methods of work, and the constant supervision by superior European officers of the work carried out by them both while they were in process of training and throughout the epidemic. The generality of those in immediate supervision over gangs seem unable to create around themselves an atmosphere of association in which a man shirking or scamping his work cannot live. The influence which (sub-inspectors) by constant personal supervision of those under them and which by laying down for themselves as well as for their men a high standard of conduct in the performance of their duties, they should exert over their gangs, seems to me to be only too frequently absent with the consequent result that superior officers have to be constantly on the move supervising them. Their standard of work is now much higher than it was at one time, but one feels that they must not be trusted to themselves.
88 With regard to the disinfection of the whole or portions of infected houses it must be borne in mind that in connection with the persistent infection of particular floors or houses the primary source of the mischief was very often not in the particular room or rooms in which plague cases occurred. We had a notable example of this latter in the case of the top floor of 104, Tank Street where a virulent epidemic refused to give way to the disinfection of single rooms but which completely disappeared when a boarded- up uninhabited loft over the site of the affected floor and from which dust found its way into the rooms below was taken in hand and thoroughly disinfected. From the boarded-up loft were moved twenty-six dead rats and a large quantity of bedding and clothing left behind by persons who had either fled from or died during previous epidemics in the same house. Dr. Fraser considers that single-room disinfection or the disinfection of a room with adjoining room where a death has occurred from plague, prevents or checks the spread of plague. He states that the propor- tion of disinfected rooms re-infected in the Central District, is about 21/2%, and this in a total sufficiently large to base the general conclusion that single-room disinfection limits the spread of plague. He gives an example of a family of five living in one room in No. 6, Packmodia Street when between January 6th and 15th 1901, all were attacked, successively, and died of pneumonic plague. After complete and thorough disinfection following on the last death, the room was immediately occupied by another family, but no cases have occurred there since. He then goes on to say:- On the other hand it will be obvious that, in a house in which the primary source of the mischief is in some part of the house untouched by our disinfectants for the reason that no case has occurred there practically no good is got from the system of single-room disinfection for the reason that you do not touch the fons et origo mali. Then again in a house in which the disease is generally disseminated little good is to be obtained by following out the system of single-room disinfection. And this has long since been apparent from a study of house-registers. The following facts will serve to bear out my contention that a system of whole house disinfection will limit or actually stop an epidemic in a house in which a large number of cases have occurred. It is to be remembered that no other influence combative to plague was evoked (such as evacuation) either before, during or after these disinfections. Some of the instances about to be cited will further bear out the fact that disinfection renders certain houses more healthy to live in and will further serve to show that in such an un- healthy house an epidemic may be nipped in the bud, although if things were left to run their ordinary course we should expect a considerable number of deaths in the house. To illustrate how disinfection of a house in its entirety nips an epidemic in the bud, let us put forward as an example 20-22, Mahomed Khan Pakhadi where between the first and 4th of February we discovered no less than seven cases of plague. The result of complete disinfection of the house has been that only one death (not from plague) has taken place in the building up to the date of this report. There has been no further case of plague. As illustrating the fact that complete disinfection of a house renders it more healthy while at the same time stopping an epidemic of plague we will put forward 540, Nagdevi Road, where after four deaths between the 6th and 26th of June last year the building was vacated on the 3rd of July of the same year. I note from the register that a death took place in the house on the 30th of July (presumably after re-occupation) and between then and the date of complete disinfection of this house (17th April), a period of little more than seven and a half months twenty-two deaths took place in this house. Since the date of disinfection up to to-day (24th June) a period of over two months only
?89 one death has occurred in the house in question: that is stated to have been from ordinary causes and it took place on the 4th of May. The reason of our whole house disinfection programme being put in force in this house was the occurrence of six deaths within the month immediately preceding disinfection. Another such case is 512, Memonwada Road in which twenty-one deaths have taken place between the 29th of June 1900 and the 31st of March 1901 (a period of eight months)- five of them at short intervals in the last twenty-six days of March 1901. As a method of putting a stop to the epidemic of which these five cases were the start we decided on whole house disinfection. The result is that up to the date of writing (the 24th of June) only two deaths have taken place in the building-one on the 11th of May not due to plague, and one on the 19th of June suspicious of plague. To illustrate the fact that whole house disinfection can nip an epidemic in the bud while the neglect of that measure enables the disease to continue in a house next door, I will put in evidence the two houses, 15 and 13, Memonwada Cross Lane. In No. 15, four deaths occurred at short intervals from the 1st to the 18th of February. In No. 13, four deaths occurred at intervals between these same dates, No. 15 was then disinfected in its entirety with the result that from then to the time of report only one death has taken place in it from ordinary causes and there has been no recurrence of plague. No. 13 was not so treated and it took until the 17th or 18th of March (a whole month longer) for the lessons of No. 15 to reach the intelligence of those left in No. 13, by which time another seven deaths had been added to their previous four. We were enabled to disinfect the place on the 18th of March but two deaths followed a few days later, said not to be due to plague but much more likely to be cases incubating or actually suffering while disinfection was being carried out. That this thorough type of disinfection now under discussion is both essential and plays a successful rle where you have the primary source of the disease not in the places where the deaths or cases occur is evidenced by the case of 104, Tank Street already cited, where a very severe epidemic, indeed, was put a stop to (after claiming a large number of victims) by its adoption to the extent of thoroughly disinfecting and clearing out a boarded-up and unoccupied loft (over the rooms in which the plague was continually occurring) and in which a large number of dead rats and abandoned bedding from old plague patients were found. Its adoption, too, in the case of a house in Mahomedkhan Pakhadi resulted in the putting a stop to recurring cases of plague therein due to the fact that dead rats and infected clothing were stored in a room in the affected floor. An interesting house in connection with this style of disinfection is 244, Ghellabhai Street. It illustrates the fact that an epidemic can be stopped by chemical disinfection while in the close neighbourhood the disease is making strong headway. It will first be necessary to give an idea of the configuration of the house which consists of two long parallelograms united by a bridge at the level of the first floor. Part I consists of a ground floor and two upper floors while Part II consists of a ground and an upper floor which have access to each other only by way of an outer stair leading to the bridge which unites Part I and II at the level of their first floors. In Part I from the 14th of December 1900 to the 13th of April 1901 thirty-two deaths took place-twenty-five of them in the last thirty days of the period mentioned- to such an extent, had the disease made headway, that the Assistant District Officer actually wrote proposing evacuation of the whole building as disinfection on the ordinary lines was apparently powerless to stop the disease. The parallelogram (Part I) in which all these deaths took place was, however, thoroughly disinfected in its entirety by myself on the 12th and 13th of April. The last death or case of disease which had occurred in this part of the building occurred on the day on which disinfection was finished. Since then the building so far as this disinfected part goes has been quite free from disease. 23
90 It may be put forward that this occurred because the disease had spent itself, but controverting the statement we have the fact that between the 22nd and 30th of the same month four cases of plague cropped up on the ground floor of Part II (non-disinfected). It was then considered to put the same process in action against a continuance of the disease on this floor to prevent the disease assuming the fearful pro- portions it had in Part I. The whole of this ground floor of part II was accordingly disinfected with the result that it has shown a clean bill of health from then to now. It was then decided to disinfect in the same way the first floor of Part II, the only part of the building not disinfected. Disinfection of this portion of Part II was started on the 6th of May and in the course of our operations we discovered a case which on the 7th of May died and this was followed by another on the following morning. A death from causes other than plague took place in this first floor on the 26th of May. Other- wise the whole house, Parts I and II, has shown a clean bill of health up to date. As further evidence of the efficacy of whole house disinfection and as showing the fact that plague uncontrolled by it in the above house would have been expected to have con- tinued and that further there was plague in the close neighbourhood of the house quoted. I may put in No. 221, Ghellabhai Street, close by. Here in the month corresponding to the one in which twenty-five cases occurred in 244, Ghellabhai Street (Part I), we had six cases of plague which died. Whole house disinfection was not tried with the result that in the twenty-two days succeeding the date of disinfection of Part I of No. 244 (in which no further cases occurred) we had in No. 221 six cases of death from plague. We were then enabled to disinfect the building in its entirety since when it has shown a clean bill of health. This house (No. 221) shows that plague was prevalent in the neighbour- hood of No. 244 when we disinfected Part I of the same and from the fact of six cases occurring within its walls in the twenty-two days immediately succeeding the day on which disinfection was finished, in the neighbouring No. 244 that plague was not on the downgrade in the neighbourhood, it further shows that the system of whole house disinfection stayed the disease in itself as until that measure was adopted the disease continued. We also deduce with an added certainty from the circums- tances attaching to it that the same measure stopped the epidemic in No. 244. It now remains for me to summarise the results of disinfection as carried out in the Central District of Bombay. We have shown:- That thorough and complete disinfection of a house in its entirety (a) Prevents the continuance of an epidemic in that house even after the disease has attained epidemic proportions. (b) Obviates the occurrence of an epidemic in a house in which several cases have occurred and in which house it is reasonable to suppose that these cases are the starting point of a house epidemic by reason of the previous bad plague history of that house, and as a result has an effect on the disease generally. That disinfection in general by destroying plague bacilli wherever carried out has an effect on the number of deaths ascribable to an epidemic both during its rise and its fall. That thorough and systematic disinfection as carried out in the Central District is superior in its results to a combination of the measures carried out during the previous epidemics, viz., Evacuation. Inoculation. Haphazard and careless disinfection,
?91 I would further suggest that it is deducible from the above main conclusions that disinfection is likely to prolong the period quiescence of the disease by reason of the large destruction of plague bacilli that must have taken place in the past six months. That the epidemic of next year, if combated by chemical disinfection alone (including sterilization of clothes, &c.) on these lines, starting at a later date is likely to last over a shorter period in its upward progress to maximum point, claiming a smaller number of victims and reaching at its acm a lower level; and that its fall to normal is more than probable to be hastened. To still further limit its duration and its magnitude the following measures should be adopted. i. A proper system of death registration and of notification of plague (among other infectious diseases) as carried out at Home. ii. Measures such as putting the more notoriously overcrowded houses under an Act approximating in its provisions and objects to the Lodging House Act of England having for its object the prevention of overcrowding and the apportioning a reasonable amount of cubic space (suitable to this country) to those residing in or lodging in large chawls. This would involve diminution in the expense and improvement in the methods of human transit in and out of the Island of Bombay as well as a building programme. iii. Improvements in the sanitary condition of insanitary houses and the adoption of a rule that all ground floors should be 'pucca'; structural changes for the admission of air and light to houses that are bad in this respect. iv. The adoption and encouragement of voluntary evacuation in the case of certain houses, involving as it does the adequate provision (over a certain period) for the housing in comfort of those displaced from their homes. v. The encouragement of inoculation, though this measure in a city like Bombay must always take a place secondary to disinfection for the reason that few avail themselves of it, and that it does not strike at the root of the trouble. vi. A most determined crusade against rats. This is a measure I lay a very large amount of stress on, and I will discuss the matter at greater length later on in this report. vii. The starting of hospitals for the clinical study of plague as well as for the treatment of the same. The hospitals should be under the immediate supervision of European Medical officers who could in this way throw a large amount of light on the disease, a thing which up to now seems to have been only carried out with a moderate amount of success for the reason apparently that few men with the necessary knowledge or ability have been in charge of such hospitals. I now proceed to discuss the proposed crusade against rats at length. The intimate connection between the rat and plague admits of no doubt and that the rat plays a most important part in the dissemination of the disease is a fact borne out by too many observations to be for a moment doubted, in fact in the Island of Bombay, we have a wide and general distribution of the disease or the reverse in proportion to the number of rats affected. Since it is an impossibility to disinfect the holes and burrows and runs of these rodents, it behoves us to ask the question is there any other way of obtaining in a measure the same results. And the answer is yes, by a great diminution in the number of rats in the Island of Bombay. Rats flourish in badly made drains and wherever filth and garbage ac- cumulate and their multiplication is due to human neglect-if there were no waste products for them to devour they would not be present in such formidable numbers. So that by directing our attention to those causes such as the accumulation of garbage, &c., to the faulty character of drains, &c., we will do an amount of good commensurate with the diminution in the number of rats therefrom. But this is not enough. It will be necessary to take measures for the actual destruction of rats. This brings us to the consideration of how to deal with them in this connection; and our mode of dealing with them will depend on (a) Whether the rats are primarily affected and act as carriers of infection. to man or; (b) Whether man is primarily affected and acts as a vehicle of infection to rats.
92 In the first case we have the most common of creatures parasitic on human trade and industry and finding a home in the insanitary surroundings of certain parts of Bombay by their secretions, by their droppings, by their deaths and in the course of their movements infecting floors, dress, articles of food as well as by their parasites. In such a case as this the only way to deal with them is to trap them as other methods of destruction such as poisoning them or fumigating their runs or the drains or sewers of a town simply extends the area of their infection by driving them from one location to another until they have over-run the whole town sowing a crop of plague in their train. This state of things appears to me to be brought about in Bombay city each year, the determining cause which decides the rat migration which takes place during an epidemic from one area to another being fear or panic on the part of the rats-panic which drives them to seek healthier surroundings where they won't see their brethren dying in vast numbers. In this way the whole of the Island becomes infected every year. Where you have primary human infection it appears to me to be even more necessary to drive rats from the theatre of infection, for you thereby prevent infection from man to rat-a mode of infection easily understood-when we consider that the rat is parasitic on human kind to the extent of his food and lodging and when at the same time it is borne in mind that all the secretions of the human body (with the exception of sweat) have been shown to contain plague bacilli. In this way you eliminate an important factor in the spread of the disease. In this connection the hospital system where you can by vigorous action keep the immediate area round a hospital clear of these "carriers of infection" appears to tend towards a diminution in the spread of the disease; that is, if the hospital is under proper control and so situate as to render it an easy matter to keep it clear of rats. A consideration of the foregoing facts would appear to lead one to the conclusion that now when plague is practically non-existent in Bombay is the time for a most vigorous crusade against these rodents which constitute the greatest agency of all in the spread of plague, as now we have them in a healthy condition (and when their migration will result in no harm), when the driving of an enormous number of them out of Bombay by fumigating their habitations, or their destruction by poison (with the almost necessarily certain migration following on such action) will considerably curtail their powers of future harm in proportion to the diminution of their numbers in Bombay city. Such action taken now and kept up continuously until the start of the rat epidemic, which one would look for next November or so, will, I feel sure, do much towards limiting the invasion of plague in Bombay city next year. To prevent the stocking of Bombay sewers, gullies, drains, &c., with a new rodent population from the ships in Bombay Harbour, each ship berthing in Bombay Docks should when discharged of cargo be taken out into the stream and there thoroughly fumigated so as to destroy every rat on board. This measure would be of special importance when plague was epidemic in Bombay for it is then that an invasion of healthy rats from the ships to infected Bombay would be of special danger. The continuous driving out or destruction of rats up to the start of the next rat infection and the prevention of the re-stocking of Bombay with rats from ships in Bombay Docks will, I feel sure, be a measure which will bring great good in its train. It will further be remembered that such a measure is a preventive one and its results ought to bear out the old adage that "prevention is better than cure." Dr. O'Brien, Special Medical Officer, E Ward, reports as follows:- The disinfectants used in this ward are Perchloride of Mercury and Phenyle. It is claimed for the former that it is one of the most powerful of disinfectants known; and that a solution of 1 in 5,000 is capable of destroying plag ue germs after one minute's contact. The strength of the solution used in this Ward stands at 1 in 950; so that it would appear un- likely that the strength of the solution is faulty. This great augmentation in strength was rendered necessary owing to the large amount of organic and mineral matter present in cow- dung. In the Agricultural Ledger No. 3 of 1894 Voelker and Ledger showed a percentage composition of 35.7 organic, 27.7 mineral matter, and 36.6 moisture, in six samples analyses of Indian cattle dung.
93 Although cow-dung is present in most of the houses in this Ward there are a large number of houses whose interior lining is of wood, koba or cement, corrugated iron. These substances do not require to be treated with the same strength of the solution. The plague organism has feebly resistant powers to weak solutions of the Perchloride. Provided that these materials are well scrubbed of all superficial dirt, a weak solution would serve every purpose of disinfection. I would therefore advise a dilution of the present original solution when it is applied to substances other than cow-dung, earth and bamboo. Cow-dung is known to possess a fair amount of albuminous coagulable material which gives it that resistant and adherent property when spread over earth and dried. When the sublimate is poured over a cow-dung floor, a tough resistant coagulate is formed as a pro- tective covering to any further action of the germicide, on the material beneath. But the very germicidal action of Perchloride of Mercury depends on its power to precipitate albumea. By coagulating the protoplasm of the plague microbe, it kills the organism. As the Hydrochloric Acid is the solution used it acts as a disintegrator and pulverizor, it is important to use sufficient solution for the quantity of cow-dung to be acted upon. Thus, in order to efficiently disinfect cow-dung it is necessary to bring every part of it into close and intimate connection with the solution. To effect this a superabundance of the solution should be constantly used. Further, it has been shown by experiment, that 10 cubic centimetres of a 1 in 725 acid solution effectively disinfects against plague 0.7 gramme of cow-dung, as 0.7 gramme of cow-dung is the amount that can generally be recovered from four square inches of a floor of a native dwelling, it follows that the floor of a room measuring 10 ft. by 10 ft. ( a very small room ) would require 8 gallons of the same solution. 8 gallons is over 3 bucket fulls. The disinfection of a floor of a room of that size is manifestly costly. Re-infection is by far the most frequent in cowdunged earthen floored houses, for where- ever cow-dung is found, there also are the following. (1) Badly constructed houses, with ill ventilation, insufficient sunlight, improper drain- age, and overcrowding. (2) Abject poverty bringing filth and dirt in its train. (3) Low caste people, who seem to be more susceptible to plague and have less powers of resistance. (4) Rats-With earthen floors, rats gain ready admission, and become free boarders. They act in their turn as the hosts of (5) Flea and vermin. Cow-dung when old becomes very dry, and cracks, and fissures make their appearance. From one of these about 21/2 ft. long I turned out what appeared like several families of the pedicule of course, one does not need to dig to find them, for they are as readily found some- where much nearer within their hosts. But, while clothes, &c., are constantly being sub- jected to the action of sunlight and water, the fissures in cowdunged earthen floors harbour old and permanent guests, whose hosts are both man and rat. It is well known that diseased rats are often literally covered with vermin. I believe that plague bacilli have been found in the intestines of a plague infected flea, and a bite from one of these would be followed with just as certain results as would be expected from an actual artificial ino- culation. It would be a wise measure to compel all huts to be floored with koba or even some kind of rough cement. Such a measure is practicable, and I am confident, that when it is established in Bombay, our disinfection would be more rapid, easier, cheaper and more certain. Bamboo comes next in importance as regards liability to harbour dirt and filth. It is a cheap article and is therefore always found in improperly constructed dwellings. It is used chiefly in the construction of partitions of rooms and in the flooring of attics. It is now a well recognised fact, that ground floors and attics have constantly shown a greater 24
?94 disposition to disinfection than any other part of a building. Bamboo is known to harbour vermin more than any other material, and occupants have learnt from experience that unless bamboos receive a periodical application of fresh mud or cow-dung, they would expect an escape of their little prisoners. Lime is now more commonly used. There seems to be only one remedy and that is limewashing or the native method which has been found by experience to prove the best. If either of these methods do not suit, I would suggest a complete demolition of partitions, which have bamboo in their con- struction, and a substitution of brick or koba or cement. Planks of wood are easily cleaned and proved satisfactory. As I have already remarked, koba, cement or chunam are by far the best for flooring and partitions. It may here be stated, that all these substances get often coated with a thin layer of cow-dung, but they do not present the same difficulty in cleaning, nor act disadvantageously in being as liable to infection as cowdunged earth. Dr. Nerurker, Mazagaon district, has given me a list of thirteen houses which had been disinfected throughout within 12 hours and in which no re-infection had occurred upto date. In nine of these houses, the floors and walls are of chunam and brick, one of wood and brick, and 3 of cow-dung, wood and bamboo. It is a common experience in this Ward to find the solution swept out immediately after the withdrawal of the disinfecting gangs. I would therefore suggest that power be given to district officers to make it impossible for a room to be occupied for at least 2 hours after disinfection has been completed. All floors should be thoroughly scraped, so as to bring every available part into close relation with the solution. I have noticed the solution lying in small puddles, while elevated portions of the floor are comparatively dry. A small wooden rake or hoe would be a useful adjunct to the disinfecting paraphernalia. Very often it is inadvisable to scrape mud of wooden floors, as in many old houses, the solution is apt to trickle through large cracks to the rooms beneath. As soon as all furniture, &c., was removed from a room, Perchloride solution was generally applied to all parts. We had, however, to keep within orders of Government and did not disinfect higher than what an ordinary man could reach. In a few instances, this rule was not adhered to where a loft imperfectly divides a room into an upper and lower space, the room was disinfected throughout. Phenyle was used when corrugated iron formed any portion of the room, as the iron by its precipitating the mercury in the solution, rendered the solution inert. Brushes were of great service, they had the disadvantage of readily getting clogged up with mud. The pump was of service in reaching inaccessible parts; they were constantly in need of repair, owing to the metal being corroded by the solution. Rat holes were filled with pitch. Dr. O'Brien makes the following remarks on his experiences in the supervision of the disinfection work in A Ward, B Ward, North, and B Ward, South:- As regards the actual disinfection of rooms, I should like to draw attention to the utmost importance of thoroughly clearing out and disinfecting the lofts which are to be found in so many of the rooms in this city. They usually contain heaps of rubbish ; dead rats are often found in them, and altogether they are the places most likely to contain infective material. I find that in many rooms, the walls and floors are covered with a coating of cowdung which has become quite hard, which cannot be removed by our brushes, and which is almost impermeable to the Perchloride solution. When this is the case, the room can scarcely be thoroughly disinfected without removing the cow-dung coating. I should advise that some iron scrapers be used for this purpose-an iron spoon, or an old knife, if large enough will do very well. As regards the disinfection of earthen floors he continues:- I should advise that the solution used for disinfecting earthen floors should be double strength (i.e., 1 in 380) or even stronger. The report of the Plague Commission states
95 that a strength of 1 in 1,000 is probably sufficient, but it presupposes the plague germs to lie on the surface of the floor. Seeing, however, the porous nature of the material of which it is composed and the possibility of infective material being carried by insects or otherwise some distance into its substance, and in view of the fact that it has been found necessary, on occasion to use Perchloride solution of a strength of 1 in 75 to kill all the germs in an earthen floor, I would much prefer that the double strength solution be used. I may say in this connection that it has been found that re-infection has been found to occur much oftener in houses with earthen floors than in those with stone or wooden floors. Dr. O'Brien then recounts the method of disinfection work generally:- Our practice has been to disinfect the room or group of rooms inhabited by the family of which the plague patient was a member, and all rooms directly communicating with them. The results of this method of working have been generally good so far as the rooms actually disinfected are concerned. They have, as a rule, remained free from infection for a consider- able time after disinfection, with the exception of the cases which have occurred within ten days and which we may regard as having imbibed the poison before the rooms were disin- fected. However, the fact remains that we have met with some houses in which plague has persisted in spite of repeated disinfections of rooms or groups of rooms. The cause of this persistence of the disease in certain houses, it is difficult to be certain of. In my opinion it is due to a variety of causes, chief of which are: (1) The fact that they are infested by rats, which carry the infection to the different rooms: (2) the dirty condition of the houses; (3) I think it has often occurred that infective material has reached many different rooms of the same house at or about the same time, but has not caused the disease in the inmates of all the infected rooms at the same time. Latterly our method of dealing with these houses in which the disease has persisted for some time has been to thoroughly disinfect them from top to bottom and the results have been very good indeed. He gives instances showing the good results obtained by disinfection of entire houses when they are found to be very badly infected. Accord- ingly he argues that the worst infected houses, since they are well known to have become so in every epidemic in the past, should be thoroughly disinfected from top to bottom before the next epidemic sets in as a precautionary measure. As examples of the good effect of this method of working, I may mention the following:- (1) In house No. 20, 1st Nowroji Hill, North (B Ward, North), 12 cases of plague occurred between the 1st and 17th March this year. On the 18th of that month it was disinfected from top to bottom. No case of plague had occurred in it from that date upto 15th April which is the last date on which I have seen its record. (2) In house No. 45, Coorla Street, 11 cases of plague occurred between 1st and 22nd March. It was evacuated and disinfected from top to bottom on 23rd of that month. It was re-occupied on 2nd April. One suspicious death occurred on 6th of that month, and no other cases up to the end of April, beyond which date I have not seen the records. In house No. 65, De Souza Street, 8 cases of plague occurred between 1st and 27th February. Three floors of the house were thoroughly disinfected on 28th February. No cases have occurred in it up to the end of April. Equally good results have been obtained in the case of several other houses which it is not necessary to mention. As a rule we have found that a house, which has been disinfected from top to bottom, remains free from infection for a subsequent period of two months. In
96 the case of a very badly infected house we have generally persuaded the inmates to evacuate it before disinfection and have kept them away for ten days if possible. Our reason for doing this has been to prevent re-infection of the house by persons in whom the disease might be incubating at the time of disinfection. Seeing the good which results from this system of working, it is not difficult to say that the plan of operations ought to be when the next epidemic breaks out. At the very commencement of the outbreak, the houses which have been notoriously badly infected in previous years (and there are many such), ought to be, in my opinion, well dis- infected from top to bottom, even before any case of plague has been discovered in them. I do not advise that any attempt be made to evacuate those houses (except perhaps for two or three days while they are drying), as the accommodation in the camps is limited and may be wanted for other people whose houses it may be thought much more desirable to eva- cuate. The kit found in these houses, had better, I think, be let alone, with the exception of such articles as bundles of dirty rags which might be opened out and spread in the sun, or better disinfected. Rat holes, of course, will be dealt with, as at present, by flushing with Perchloride solution and tarring. It may be said that it would be better to keep a care- ful watch on these houses, and according as a case of plague is discovered in any one of them, to thoroughly disinfect that one immediately, but I should much prefer the plan of disinfecting the lot of them at the start for the following reasons: (1) These houses have become badly infected every time or nearly every time plague has become epidemic in the city and it is reasonable to suppose that they will continue to become infected in future epidemics. After complete disinfection, they as a rule remain free from infection for two months. Therefore by disinfecting them every two months we can keep most of them free from infection for the whole epidemic. (2.) When the first case is discovered in one of these houses it is very likely that several of the other inmates will have the germs of the disease (in the incubation stage) in their systems. These when their own house is being disinfected, may go elsewhere, develop the disease, and so infect fresh houses, or they may re-infect their own houses. That an epidemic of plague is found among rats before it attacks human beings, is a coincidence has not escaped the notice of Dr. O'Brien and he points out that when rats are found to be dying, it will be then the proper time to commence the disinfection of the worst infected houses of the kind just mentioned. He remarks as follows:- I may allude here to the very interesting fact, that rats are generally found to be dying in large numbers some six weeks or two months before the plague becomes epidemic in human beings. This occurrence, which has, I think, been noticed every time an epidemic of plague has broken out in Bombay, would seem to show that the germ of plague, after it has passed through the system of the rat, takes some time to reach a stage in which it can develop the disease in human beings, and ought to have an important bearing on our preventive measures in future years. It furnishes additional evidence of the necessity of disinfecting houses with a bad history before any case of plague is discovered in them. With regard to houses that are found to be not so badly infected he advises that where plague rats are found and the occupants have been attacked, it is best to disinfect whole floors or if possible the whole house. "Rats would shift their quarters to other parts of the house to escape the wetting they would get from the solution, and so spread the disease to the other floors, hence the necessity of disinfecting the entire house." Dr. O'Brien states in conclusion thus:- That nothing has been so well impressed on me during my experience of the disinfection carried out in Bombay this year, than the necessity for constant supervision of the subordi- nate staff.
97 Dr. Patrick sums up his views on disinfection as follows:- My belief is that not only is disinfection useless in Bombay but that it is actually harmful inasmuch as it withdraws the attention of the public and of the executive from the possibility of adopting measures of permanent value for the sanitary state of the city. Disinfecting Bombay by means of chemical solutions is an impossibility. Until the city be so reconstructed that into all its streets and through all its houses sunlight may enter freely and with it fresh air, the conditions favourable to the continuance and spread of plague will remain. Temporary measures have been carried out for the last five years at great expense to Government and to the Municipality with no resultant permanent benefit to the health of the community and no apparent effect upon the course of the plague epidemic in any one year or from one year to another. I would confidently offer the opinion that if all plague measures as such were abandoned and attention given to the sanitation of the city, actual and potential, by strengthening the hands of the city Health Officer in every direction great expense would be saved, and results as good nay better because more permanent would be obtained. 25

The corresponding figure last year was about 1,10,000 people. These figures illustrate the action of the new measures very clearly. Owing to the abolition of compulsory removal to hospitals the numbers of contacts and evicts sent to hospital camps, either public or private have markedly fallen off. 26
102 In the same way the people unless they are made to evacuate by compul- sion do not care to go to camp as a temporary measure, as the figures conclusively show. Public Camps. There is a general feeling however, that the people would go to camp if they were provided with free quarter and permitted to remain for the epidemic period, say about four or five months. It is well known that once they are lodged under such circumstance they endeavour to remain in these huts as long as they possibly can, and are only turned out after considerable difficulty. With regard to Municipal camps the following camps in different parts of the city were either repaired or strengthened during the year. 1. Camps at Victoria Bunder. 2. Vithal Sayana Camp. 3. Arthur Crawford Market Camp. 4. Goculdas Hospital Camp. 5. Elphinstone Bridge Camp. 6. Wari Bunder Camp. 7. Northbrook Garden Camp. 8. Babula Tank Camp. 9. Mahim Hospital Camps. The following camps were maintained during the rains, but pulled down before 31st May 1901:- 1. Vital Sayana Camp. 2. Piru Lane Camp. 3. Grant Road Camp. 4. Narielwadi Health Camp. 5. Gilder Street Camp. Some of these were pulled down, as they stood on low-lying ground likely to be under water during the rains and others being old and in- capable of being strengthened. It was not thought necessary to maintain these camps, in future. Some of the materials of the camps so pulled down were utilized in repairing and strengthening other camps and in erecting sheds for beggars at Goculdas Health Camp and at the Arthur Road Hospital. About 89,372 sq. yards of ground at Vincent Road was placed at the disposal of the Municipality by the City Improvement Trust for the erection of sheds by the public during the plague. One hundred and thirteen temporary sheds were erected on this ground including the Parsi Punchayet and the Times of India sheds. One hundred and ninety- one sheds were also erected on private ground at Matunga. Thirteen stand-pipes were put up on Municipal and private grounds and seven blocks (5 seated) of public latrines were put up on Municipal and private grounds with the necessary drainage arrangements (open channels carried into cesspools). All these sheds have been removed, except those belonging to the Parsi Punchayet and the Times of India.
103 The plague administration continue to be indebted to Sir Dinshaw Maneckji Petit for the loan of the site of the Maratha Hospital. He indeed offered to present the site to the Municipality for use as a General Hospital for epidemic diseases but died, before the terms of settlement could be effected. The Colaba Land and Mill Company have again for another year generously lent their ground at the Victoria Bunder Chawls, for use as a plague camp. Besides the above, there were several other gentlemen who gave the free use of their property in F and G Wards and elsewhere during the year. Government land was occupied rent free. The Port Trust conti- nued to charge 3/16 of the ordinary rates for land let out to the Municipality for plague purposes and the Improvement Trust charged out of pocket expenses or such rent as they would otherwise have secured. The camps were managed on the same lines as described in last year's report. The camps in the North of the Island were under the control of Captain Boileau, District Officer, F & G Wards. Their manage- ment left nothing to be desired. The people were contented and no complaints were received. Captain Boileau reports as follows:- There were no Municipal camps erected during the past epidemic and as compared with 1900 there were few people in the fields who were outsiders to my district. Those who did come from Bombay were accommodated in much the same way as in 1900. Latrines and water were given to all communities numbering over 100 souls and to the very poor people who were unable to pay for water connection. 58 stand-pipes and 22 latrines were erected. The total number of people in camp taken on the 25th March was 19,000. They were mostly Brahmins, Lohanas and Marathas with a sprinkling of Goanese. There were no Mahomedans in the camps. The camps were extended from Dadar station, G. I. P. Ry. and Vincent Road on the south up to Sion and Mahim on the north, and in addition large numbers of people were evacuated from Sewri Koliwada, Sion and Dharavi. There were also a few people in camp between Elphinstone Road station B. B. & C. I. Ry., and Dadar, B. B. & C. I. Ry., on the west of the Railway line. With the exception of one camp (Mr. Chapwalla's) situated to the west and north of new Matunga station, all the camps enjoyed the best of health, and there were com- paratively few cases of plague. Mr. Chapwalla's camp, however, became badly infected, the reason being, that although orders to the contrary being given, some people returned to their homes in Bombay during the day and caught infection there, which was developed in camp, and gave rise to several fatal cases. The community then decided to break up the camp and shifted it to another site more easternly when plague was at once arrested. The camps were administered by Mr. Patel, Camp Master who had under him six Registration Ramosis, and the work of the detection of sickness was efficiently carried out by him. Altogether 56 plague cases and plague deaths were reported by him, the deaths from all causes being 61. Halalkhore arrangements were made as before under the direction of the Divisional Health Officer, Dr. Sorab C. Hormusjee and were excellently rendered. The water-supply was plentiful and good, and the stand-pipes were promptly erected where ordered by Messrs. Pinto and Rodrigues, the Water Inspectors of F and G Wards.
104 Captain Smith offers the following remarks on the subject of camps:- A number of private camps were erected on the Kennedy Sea Face. These camps were placed in charge of the District Plague Office, A Ward, and consequently I am not in a position to report on them. I would, however, suggest that in future years that these camps should not be given over to well-to-do communities, but that the camps should be erected at Municipal expense, and poorer classes from the slums and badly infected houses and quarters of C Ward should be made to compulsorily vacate their very wretched hovels and be made to live in these camps, and the chawls, etc., that they vacate should be compulsorily closed. The only camp belonging to C Ward was the Goculdas Tejpal. This camp was originally built to hold over 1,700 persons, but since compulsory evacuation has ceased the capacity of the camp has been reduced to about 600. At first the old rules were in force and contacts and evicts were sent to the camp, and it used to be kept pretty well full. Nowadays however, it has remained very empty comparatively speaking. The reasons amongst many, that this camp was not used so much as it might have been was the fact that in accordance with the rules for the use of Plague Officials in Bombay City laid down that it would be only allowable to let the people whose houses were being disinfected remain in camp two or three days. I, however, used to allow them at least ten days, and I would never guarantee more. In many cases where the people came from highly-infected houses, localities, etc., I also allowed the people to remain more than a month. The people would not move into camp for such short periods as ten days as they said that it was too much trouble to go out for so short a time and then have to return to their houses. They were quite willing to go into camp if they could go two or more months. Many persons during the past year have come and asked the Sectional Medical Officers and myself whether they could not have camp accommodation as they were living in a locality in which rats were dying in large numbers and plague cases were occurring in the surrounding houses. They were always very disappointed when I told them the short period for which I could give accommodation. I have at different times been asked by people of various classes why I did not remove or allow the poorer people to go into camp and so save them from the infection. One or two very badly infected houses were very nearly completely evacuated and the people induced to go to camp. Some of the people were quite willing to go but they refused to quit their dark hovels unless they had a promise from the landlord that on their return from camp they would be allowed to re-occupy those they were then in. In the case of 35-1, Picket Road it was not until the landlord's representative had promised this that we could induce the occupants to go to camp. Even then one or two families remained in the house and would not move out. This house was very badly infected. The people went out on 28th January, and between 31st January and 9th February 1901 no less than twelve of these people developed plague and were removed to hospital. In previous years, this chawl which has a very bad history used to be compulsorily evacuated as soon as plague showed itself in it. People from Takwadi, No. 19, were induced to go to camp, but they would not go until very many of them had succumbed to plague. In fact, the last family to go had previ- ously absolutely refused to move out and did not do so until one of them was attacked. Plague was arrested in Nos. 8 and 9, Bhangwadi amongst a number of Brahmins by inducing them to go to camp. Rao Saheb Purshotum Odhavji assisted me very greatly in inducing these people to go out. As regards Camps Dr. Britto writes as follows:-" The people themselves have learned to appreciate the good effects of removing from infected houses, as in all instances where the houses were badly infected, they asked for accommodation in camp. Many availed themselves of the concession, while others were obliged to stay in the houses as the time allowed in camps was limited to ten days. Under the circumstances they found it difficult to leave their houses on the off chance of securing other quarters at the expiration of ten days. It is a generally known fact that people from infected houses and localities are refused house accommodation in other and better localities and houses."
105 I consider for future epidemics camps should be erected on the Kennedy Sea Face by the Municipality and the Goculdas Tejpal camp should be enlarged, and these camps should be set apart solely for the use of people from all the badly infected quarters in C Ward and other wards if necessary. These camps should be utilized only for the poor people who should be made to compulsorily evacuate very badly infected houses. The history of all houses is now well-known and these houses should be emptied previous to the outbreak of plague in epidemic form. These people should be given camp accommodation for the whole period of the epidemic and when plague had subsided, they should then be allowed to return to their houses which should be well disinfected before they return. Dr. Cama has suggested with reference to his own section that a health camp should be built in North-Brook Gardens for the purpose of housing the poor from Kumbharwada section, and that during the epidemic a hospital should be opened in the Grant Road Hospital so as to enable the people to go and see their sick relatives, friends, etc. I think this suggestion might be followed as regards the proposed Kennedy Sea-Face camps as the Hindu Fever Hospital is there. 1 think this measure would be most popular with the masses at large, and would tend very largely to reduce plague mortality in the crowded parts of the city. The compulsorily vacated houses should be closed and not re-occupied until the plague subsided. Private Camps. The Kennedy Sea Face and Modikhana were again utilized by various communities for camping out during the open season of the year under report. The camps were placed under the supervision of a Superintendent with a staff of scavengers, halalkhores, &c. As in the past so in the present year, the Pathare Prabhu Camp was the best managed, though it was run very close by the Dakshni Brahmin, Christian and Parsee Health Camps. The Pathare Prabhu Health Camps. The Honorary Secretary of the Pathare Prabhu Health Camp Rao Bahadur Dhakji Cassinathji has been foremost in the work connected with his camp, while he took a keen interest in the welfare of the other camps as well. He reports as follows:- Introduction.-The leaders of the Pathare Prabhu community had been keenly watch- ing the results of the various efforts which were being made by Government, at enormous cost, and under the advice of acknowledged experts. It has been amply proved by the ex- perience gained by me as Chairman of the Volunteer Committee, Market Section, Ward C and as Secretary of the Pathare Prabhu Health Camps, that the only remedy against plague is to shift in time from the affected localities and that too for the season, and not for ten or fifteen days, a period at one time thought to be sufficient. I found that houses though thoroughly disinfected were not free from plague germs, and my conviction was so strong that at one time I insisted upon the District Plague Officer sending back to the segregation camp persons who were removed from a highly affected house and returned after a short period. Under my advice these persons willingly consented to remain at the camps for a longer time. In my humble opinion, Government would do well if they spent more money in provid- ing health camps for the poor, and aiding private health camps by contributing towards the cost of erection of huts, for, as is the case with us, generally most of the occupants are poor, and would have to be provided for in Government or Municipal camps if there were no private health camps. I would, however, in consideration of such con- cession, insist upon the strict observance of sanitary rules by the inmates of private health Camps, as a neglect of the rules at any one camp does harm not only to the inmates of that camp, but also to those of the adjacent camps. 27
106 Since the opening of our Health Camps the mortality in our community from plague has been considerably reduced and the work at our Fever Hospital lessened. The cases that do occur are directly traceable to the families having stayed in their houses even after the rat mortality was discovered. The delay in some instances was due to a show of foolish courage in disregarding Nature's warning, while in others simply to unavoidable causes. The space allotted to us on the Kennedy Sea Face is limited while the number of applicants for accommodation is increasing year by year, owing to the people's inability to bear the expenditure incidental to removal to the suburbs every year. I had therefore to encroach upon the open space in our camps hitherto reserved for recreation purposes to provide additional accommodation. Last year it was the intention of our community to erect huts in our Health Camps of a semi-permanent character to avoid the large recurring annual expenditure and in com- pliance with my request the Municipal Commissioner kindly obtained the consent of the Chairman of the City Improvement Trust and intimated to me that the Municipality also had no objection to my proposal. But before this intimation was received the camps had to be erected and therefore they were constructed on the old lines and no further action was taken in the matter. Visits of their Excellencies Lord and Lady Northcote to the Health Camps.-His Excellency Lord Northcote, the Governor of Bombay, visited our Fever Hospital and Health Camps on Thursday the 7th March last. His Excellency was received by Rao Bahadur Dhakji Kashinathji, the Honorary Secretary, Mr. Nanu Narayen Kothare, Mr. Anandrao Harishankar and Drs. Atmaram V. Velkar, Vinayek S. Trilokekar and Anandrao P. Kothare, Members of the Pathare Prabhu Health Camps and Fever Hospital Committees. His Excellency, having honored the whole community by his visit to the Health Camps, to see personally the arrangements made for the shelter and comforts of the poor, who the Chairman assured His Excellency, felt grateful to him for the sympathy thus shown to them in such calamitous times. His Excellency then thanked the community for the hearty and loyal welcome given him and expressed his satisfaction with the arrangement of the Health Camp. This year the community was very fortunate, for their Health Camp was visited also by Her Excellency Lady Northcote. On the 12th March last Her Excellency was received at the entrance by Rao Bahadur Dhakji Kashinathji, Mr. Nanu Narayen Kothare, Mr. Anandrao Harishankar and Drs. Govindrao B. Prabhaker, Atmaram V. Velkar, Vinayek S. Trilokekar and Anandrao P. Kothare. and Messrs. Jagannath N. Desai and Laxuman V. Jayakar, managers. On entering the compound, Her Excellency was received by Miss Kamlabai Prabhakar and Miss Kirtikar who conducted her to a specially prepared seat where a large number of the ladies residing at the camp had already assembled, and who on her arrival rose to their feet and offered to Her Ladyship a very cordial welcome. Her Excellency while being conducted round the camp by Rao Bahadur Dhakji, the Honorary Secretary, made minute inquiries about the erection, maintenance and management of the camp and after a careful inspection left amidst the cheers of the people. Sites.-With the permission of the Municipal Commissioner our Camp No. I was erected on the Kennedy Sea Face and Camp No. II near the Hindu Gymkhana. This year several private health camps which were elsewhere before, were allowed to be put up on the Kennedy Sea Face without leaving sufficient open spaces between the several camps, and thus there was somewhat overcrowding which might be avoided in future. Municipal Help.-The Municipal Commissioner was, as usual, kind enough to pro- vide latrines, washing places, water taps, tubs for cook-room waste water and lights, also conservancy establishment and Police Ramosis. For all these concessions our community is thankful to that officer. I would, however, request him to re-consider the question of water- supply and drainage. The want of an adequate supply of water in Camp No. 1 was almost intolerable, and this fact was acknowledged by the Officers concerned. It is evident that unless water-connection is given direct from the main on the road, our want in this respect will not be met. This
107 year there was almost a water famine. Some people in despair, went to their highly-infected houses in the City, whilst others went on the other side of the Queen's Road and somehow opened the plugs of the tanks near the Night-soil Dept and public latrines at Sonapur, and obtained water from there. The authorities subsequently put a separate tap to the tanks referred to to permit our people taking water from there. The consequences of a short supply of water are serious, as the residents are compelled to go to their houses in the infected areas for bathing, washing, clothing and even for preparing food. Indeed, some plague cases discovered in the Camps were attributable to this action. Medical Inspection.-The undermentioned Medical gentlemen on the Committee under- took this year the daily Medical inspection of the residents of the Camps:- Dr. G. B. Prabhakar. Dr. A. V. Velkar. Dr. V. S. Trilokekar. Dr. A. P. Kothare. The result of the inspection was recorded in a book which was kept open in the Camp Office room for the Officials and others to see at any time the daily state of the Camps. Any case found suspicious was at once separated and kept under observation and eventually transferred to our Fever Hospital if it became a confirmed plague case. In my last year's report the honorary services of the Medical gentlemen named above were strongly recommended for recognition. It was also suggested that Dr. A. V. Velkar, Dr. V. S. Trilokekar and Dr. A. P. Kothare be appointed Justices of the Peace. I trust this recommendation will not be lost sight of at the ensuing opportunity. It is needless for me to mention that it would have been impossible to keep the camps in the healthy condition they were in, without the able and willing assistance of these Doctors who also worked at our Fever Hospital at great personal sacrifice. Control and Management.-The general control, as before, was exercised by a Com- mittee consisting of- Chairman. Mr. Nanu Narayen Kothare, J. P. Members. Rao Bahadur Dhakji Kashinathji, J. P. (Honorary Secretary). Mr. Anandrao Harishankar (Honorary Treasurer). Dr. Govindrao Bhau Prabhakar. ,, Atmaram Vasudev Velkar. ,, Vinayek Sokarji Trilokekar. ,, Anandrao Putoba Kothare. Mr. Vinayekrao Meghasham Navalkar. The Honorary Secretary, Rao Bahadur Dhakji Kashinathji, J. P., had the general charge and management of the Camps and he was very ably supported by- Honorary Members. Mr. Jaganath Anandrao Desai. Mr. Luxuman Vinayekrao Jayakar. Rao Bahadur Dhakjee Kashinathjee in his interesting report on this camp gives the following information about those who were attacked with plague. It accentuates the necessity for early evacuation of infected quarters and removal to camp and shows the danger of return- ing to infected dwellings so long as the epidemic has not declined. He states:- It was thought that there would be no plague this year, and if any, it would be of a very mild type, but it did come and with increased virulence. Those who shifted early were provided for in Camp No. 1 and those who came late, in Camp No. 2. The fact that
108 only one case of plague was found in Camp No. 1 and that too under the circumstances stated furtheron, and three in camp No. 2 proves that those who came to Camp No. 2 did so after their houses had been highly charged with infection. The plague case removed from Camp No. 1 was that of Gajanan Gunputrao. He came to the Camp on 26th December 1900 and against our remonstrances removed on 20th February 1901 to a house, on Borebhat Naka, which was vacated by the owner owing to the rat mortality. He went there to perform the marriage of his niece and returned to the Camp on 24th February. On the 26th idem, he became ill and was removed to the Hospital having been declared to be a plague case. Thus, it is evident that but for this indiscreet action there would have been no plague case in Camp No. 1. The three cases removed from Camp No. 2 were as under: -   1   Ahiliabai   Members of one family. 2. Esabai    Arrived at the Camp on 9th January 1901 and removed to the Hospital on the 13th idem. There had been plague cases in their houses in New Line Street prior to their shifting to the Camp.   3.   Moreshwar Vasantrao.  Arrived at the Camp on 17th February from Pallow Road and was sent to the Hospital on 27th March 1901. It is difficult to say where he caught the infection, but it was found that this boy, besides going to his house, often went to play to the adjacent Sonar Camp where a plague case was discovered. There was no death from plague in our camps.  Parsi Private Health Camps.

109 The Camp at DeLisle Road was kept in readiness for use, but it was not availed of. Materials for the erection of a Camp at Matunga also were ready, but it was not found necessary to erect the Camp. The Trustees offer their cordial thanks to the Municipal Commissioner and to the owners and Trustees of the several plots of ground for their kindness in placing their land and the "Wadi" at the disposal of the community, and to the medical gentlemen for their kindness in volunteering to look after the health of the different camps. All the Camps were managed by camp-masters, assisted by a staff of ramosees and other servants. The accommodation in the Camps at the Marine Lines and at Churney Road was most under requisition, owing to the proximity of these Camps to the business quarters of the town. Permission to occupy the Camps was at first given for one month only, but that period was extended when the localities, from which the inmates originally came, continued to be affected. The following table gives the districts from which the occupants of the Camps were drawn, and the number of families and of persons that had removed to them. Districts. No. of families.

About 26,000 square feet of ground on the Kennedy Sea Face was provided for 370 people belonging to the Portuguese community, mostly of the class of Government and mercantile clerks. Mr. Godinho was the Secretary and General Manager of the Camp. 28
110 The people commenced to move into Camp in the month of January. Bamboo sheds were built with mat walls and palmyra palm roofs at an average cost of Rs. 70 each. Dr. J. Lobo attended volun- tarily to the health of the people, who enjoyed very good health. No fatal case occurred either from plague or any other cause whilst they were encamped. Their Excellencies Lord and Lady Northcote visited the Camp, an honour which was deeply appreciated by the people. Mr. Godinho on behalf of the community gave expression to their gratitude for the kindly interest taken in their welfare by Their Excellencies. Mr. Godinho reports that the occupants of the Camp felt quite con- fident of their safety and freedom from the plague and that they enjoyed a very peaceful and happy time accordingly. The Pathare Prabhu Bhagvantrao Health Camp. Mr. R. V. Kothare submits the following interesting report of the Pathare Prabhu Bhagvantrao Health Camp. Season.-13th December 1900 to 3rd June 1901. Indications of the recrudescence of the plague having manifested themselves once more the Secretary, by direction of the Managing Committee of this Camp, applied to the Municipal authorities on the 9th October 1900 for the plot of ground allotted last year for the purposes of the Camp. Sanction having been accorded on the 29th November 1900, the work of erecting the sheds was completed on the 27th December 1900. 2. The Camp was occupied by 198 souls. 3. The cost of construction was distributed equally between the Residents according to the number of rooms occupied by them. 4. The Managing Committee continued the same as last year viz.: - President. Mr. Bhagvantrao Dwarkanath. Members. Mr. Narayan L. Manker. B.A. Mr. Harischandra S. Trilokekar (since died). Mr. Laxuman R. Agaskar. Mr. Ramrao A. Kirtikar. Mr. Mothabhai M. Jayakar. Mr. Ballaram V. Sanjit, B.A. Secretary. Mr. R. V. Kothare. Superintendent. Mr. M. V. Kothare. Medical Supervisions. Dr. A. V. Velkar, L.M.&S. Dr. V. S. Trilokekar, L.M.&S. Dr. A. P. Kothare, L.M.&S. Dr. N. L. Mankar, L.R.C.P.&S. (Edin.) 5. The Managing Committee, on behalf of themselves and the residents of the Camp, beg to express their sincere gratitude to the Medical gentlemen of their community above- noted, who volunteered their services and visited the Camp regularly by turns, during the period under report. Like last year a Diary was kept in which the Medical gentlemen noted all cases of illness in the Camp.
?111 6. Cases of Illness.-During the period under report there was no illness in the Camp with the exception of the following cases:- Pneumonia,-Two cases, both boys under ten years, who got over the illness after a fort- night. Anmia.-One case, patient aged 52 years, admitted in a bad state of health, rallied for some time since admission into the Camp, but got worse and succumbed to the disease about three months after admission. Plague.-A lady in room No. 12 was found by the doctor, on his usual round of in- spection, suffering from plague. She was immediately removed to P. P. Fever Hospital, where she died on the 2nd day of her admission. There is good ground for believing that as she constantly went to her house in the town, which was highly affected, she caught the infection there. 7. Fire.-On the 6th March at about 4-30 A. M. a cry of fire was raised, and it was discovered that the rear of rooms Nos. 16 & 17 was on fire which was extinguished almost immediately afterwards. In this connection the Managing Committee beg to place on record the valuable services rendered by Mr. N. V. Ranjit in promptly extinguishing the fire. The cause of the fire yet remains a mystery; but bearing in mind the fact that on the said morning when the fire broke out there was no camp-resident awake and that no light was burning in the kitchen, the Managing Committee are or opinion that some person or persons mischievously inclined towards the camp-residents set fire, and that it cannot be attributed to accident or beedy smoking. The Municipal authorities after this occurrence desired the Secretary to furnish the Camp with fire-precautions, such as ladders, hooks, tubs full of water, buckets, etc., which was duly done. 8. The Gorernor's Visit.-His Excellency Lord Northcote was graciously pleased to pay a visit to the Camp on the 30th March 1901 and was received by the President and the Secretary and was garlanded. 9. Lady Northcote's Visit.-Her Excellency Lady Northcote was graciously pleased to pay the Camp a visit on the morning of the 12th March 1901. Her Excellency was re- ceived by the ladies of the Camp. A small address of welcome was read in English by Miss Naik and songs were sung in English and Marathi by some ladies. Her Excellency was garlanded and presented with a bouquet. Messrs. Gomes & Co., Photographers, kindly photographed the group of Her Excellency and the ladies of the Camp. It appears that they sent the photo to England. It has appeared in the Illustrated London News and some other Magazines. 10. Thanks-giving Prayers to the Almighty.-All the residents of the Camp gathered on the 18th May 1901 and performed Shree Satya Narayan Pooja ( worship) and offered prayers to the Almighty for having saved them from the dire disease and for the long life and prosperity of the King-Emperor and Captains Pritchard and Lockhart-Mure and other Municipal Officers who gave the Camp every facility regarding conservancy and other arrangements and who were always very courteous to all concerned for which act of kindness the residents are profoundly grateful to them. 11. The work of dismantling the sheds commenced on the 1st June 1901 and was brought to a close on the 8th idem. Dr. P. J. De Souza, who took honorary medical charge of some of the Health Camps on the Kennedy Sea Face and whose work was much appreciated, gives the following brief report:- I was asked by Capt. Pritchard the Personal Assistant to the Municipal Commissioner, if I would take honorary medical charge of some of the Health Camps at Kennedy Sea Face. I consented to do so. I found the different camps in good condition and the arrangements working smoothly. The system observed this year was, to select some one
?112 responsible person in each camp who would act as headman and give me prompt intimation of any cases of illness or death that might occur in the group of huts or sheds placed in his charge. I then called at the particular hut reported to me as containing a case and satisfied myself as to the nature and duration of the illness or cause of death. In addition, I went round the camps daily on a general visit of inspection. The mortality is unusually low considering the total number of individuals that were passed through the camp and especially the insanitary surroundings from which they came in. The tabular statement appended shews that during the five months in which the camps were under my observation, there were three cases of plague attacks and two of plague deaths. I proceed to deal with these one after another:- Plague Attack No. 1.-This was a Purdesi who took ill at Mahaluxmi and was in that condition brought down into the Camp. His presence was detected on the second day after his arrival and even then with difficulty. It was only after much persuasion that he con- sented to go to hospital. Plague Attack No. 2.-This woman came into camp from a highly infected house on the 26th of February 1901. She was found to be with plague on the 9th of March, but had been ailing for two days previously. In my opinion she came infected and the disease declared itself within the period of incubation. Plague Attack No. 3.-This was a boy living in hut No. 1 in the Daivadnya No. 2 Camp. A few days previously a person from Revdanda had died of plague in the adjoining hut No. 2, and this lad in all likelihood caught the contagion from that case. He had been living in Camp for two or three months previously and had been enjoying good health. I had some difficulty in seeing this case as the parents put all kinds of obstacles in the way of my doing so. Plague Death No. 1.-No information was given to me of the illness in this case. The first I knew of it was when after cremation of the corpse I was asked for a certificate as to the cause of death. I declined to certify and from the circumstances thought, the man had died of plague. The Sectional Medical Officer also put it down as a plague case. Plague Death No. 2.-This was the case of the man from Revdanda to which reference has been made above. He came down on the evening of the 15th from Revdanda to live with some of his relatives in the camp and died of plague on the 16th. It seemed to be a clear case of imported plague as his surroundings in Camp were quite healthy. I would note that in all the above cases of plague attacks and deaths, the respective huts were completely disinfected and the roofs removed to allow of through ventilation and these prompt measures probably saved the Camp from further infection. Secretariat Camp.-This is a permanent set of hutments put up for the use of Secre- tariat Peons. It consists of 4 rows of sheds, each row being divided into 3 blocks. The middle block in each row contains 4 huts and each side block 5. There are thus 56 huts in all. In addition to these there is a small block to the South of this Camp occupied by a havildar of the Improvement Trust Office. At present the occupants are served by a set of water-taps placed near the railway railing and thus in bringing water to and fro and in using it much of it is splashed about and a good deal of damp created. To obviate this I would suggest that two nnees be put up between each set of two rows at each corner for the convenience of those who occupy the latter. Both nnees might be connected by an open drain emptying into the main. This seems to me the only way to prevent excessive mois- ture and to keep the soil from becoming unhealthily damp. On the whole, the camps have conduced greatly to the good health of their occupants who realize that they form the pleasantest means available for avoiding the plague. Experience has shown them how to minimize any inconveniences that might have existed when these camps were merely a tentative measure and altogether matters have proceeded comfortably and harmoniously under the careful and considerate supervision of Captains Pritchard and Lockhart-Mure to whom the best thanks of the camp inmates are due.

114 The following is the report of Mr. Ekins, Superintendent of Private Health Camps, regarding the other private camps in his charge. His duties were to visit all the camps and see that they were clean and well kept; to see that the halalkhore and scavenger staff carried out their duties properly; to carry out disinfection in case of plague; and to make sure that every case of sickness was promptly reported to him. Bhatia Segregation camp, Cruikshank Road. This Camp was opened on 29th January 1901. It was managed by a Committee of the Bhatia community from the Mahajan funds. Mr. Khimjee Jairam Narainjee is the Secretary and Rao Saheb Hurjiwan Soonderdass the Manager, There was accom- modation for 150 persons, but the maximum number who availed themselves of it this year was 57. It was provided with one halalkhore and two water-taps at Municipal expense. One ramosi, six lamps, and four latrines were provided by the community. There were no deaths in Camp; the residents were not permanent; they remained in camp only for a week or fortnight at a time, and were succeeded by others. The camp was closed on 22nd May 1901. Parsi Camp No. 1. This Camp was opened on 31st January 1901. It consisted of tents for the inmates and cudjan huts for kitchens and nahanis the same as last year.

Modi, Those who could afford to pay were charged a nominal rent of Rs, 4 per mensem, the poorer people being accommodated free. There were two imported cases of plague which were removed to hospital where the patients died. There were no deaths in Camp from any cause. Two coolies, one halalkhore and six water-taps were supplied at Municipal expense. The lighting, latrines, and one ramosi were supplied by the Punchayet. Dr. K. M. Gimi was the inspecting Medical officer. The camp was closed on 27th May 1901. Dakshani Brahmin Camp No. 1. This Camp was opened on 23rd December 1900. Accommodation was provided for about 400 persons, the maximum number who availed themselves of it being 386. The majority of the huts were erected by the tenants themselves, and the rest from the funds of the community from the materials at hand from last year. The managing committee con- sisted of 20 gentlemen of the community or one to represent each block of huts; the whole presided over by Rao Bahadur Narayen Trimbuck Vaidya, J. P., with Mr. W. B. Gokhale as Secretary. The internal management of this camp was complete in every respect under the able and energetic supervision of the President, who resided in camp himself at consider- able personal inconvenience to encourage his people. A system of open masonry drains run- ning from west to east behind the huts built at the expense of the community to carry off waste water from nahanis and kitchens was a very satisfactory sanitary arrangement, necessitating the employment of one cooly only at Municipal expense, for a community of nearly 400 persons. Three plague cases occurred, 1 dying in camp, the other two after removal to Hospital. There were four deaths from ordinary causes. One cooly, one halal- khore and one ramosi were supplied at Municipal expense, also eight water-taps, twelve privy seats and ten night lamps. The Medical Officer was Dr. K. N. Gokhale, who was also a resident of the camp. The Camp was vacated on 20th May 1901. Somavanshi Kshatrya Camp. This Camp was opened on 31st December 1900.

Water-Supply.-The water-supply was found to be sufficient, the total number of water-taps provided being 80. Besides these, one tap was supplied from the Chandanwadi Cross Lane Road watering supply tanks for the use of the Pathare Prabhu community in case of scarcity. Four taps were laid on, two in each of the Dakshini Brahmin Camps at the expense of the community for their personal convenience. Latrines:-The Municipality supplied 110 latrines.

Disinfectants were supplied by the Municipality, the latrines and urinals being washed out twice daily and oftener if necessary with a solution of phenyle, after which they were sprinkled with Sanitas powder. 30
?118 Lighting:-Night lamps were supplied by the Municipality in all the lanes between the huts and between Camps, at a cost of Rs. 2-8-0 per lamp per month. The total number of lamps supplied was 87 ; the Parsi and Bhatia Camps supplying their own which are not included in this total. Precaution against fire: -Precautions against fire were taken by each community storing water in tubs which were placed in some conspicuous places, and laying in a supply of buckets and fire hooks which were kept ready at hand. The Pathare Prabhu and Dakshini Brahmin Camps were the best supplied in this respect. No fires of any importance occurred in the Camps. Medical Inspection. -A system of Medical inspection was carried out, the Secretary or Manager of each Camp being requested to report all cases of illness to the Inspecting Medical Officer at his daily visit, and to the Superintendent of the Camps who took steps to have the patient removed to hospital and the necessary disinfection carried out in all cases of plague where the patient was not too ill to be removed. If too ill, the disinfection was carried out after recovery or death of the patient. In Pathare Prabhu and Dakshini Brahmin Camps no persuasion was necessary as they very sensibly gave every help in this respect. Drainage. -The Camps situated near the Marine Lines Station were provided with an open masonry drain near the water taps to carry off the waste water from the washing places. This was not the case in those camps situated near the Charni Road Station, they being provided with pipe-drains which frequently became choked and caused some inconvenience and extra labour on the Drainage Department. For the waste water from the kitchens and private nahanis tubs and drums were supplied which were emptied by the coolies supplied by the Municipality, and phenyle solution put into them ;  except in the Dakshini Brahmin camps where open masonry drains leading into the main were constructed at the expense of the community. The latter system was more effective, sanitary and economical than the system of tubs and drums. Statistics: -The health of the residents of the Camps was exceptionally good, the total number of deaths from ordinary causes being only 30, plague attacks 26, and plague deaths in Camps 10. The majority of the plague cases were imported and developed after a few days residence in camp, sometimes on the day of arrival ; or occurred in persons who were residents of the camps, but were in the habit of frequenting highly infected quarters of the town. The maximum number of residents in the Camps for each month was as follows: - December 1900 405 January 1901 1,720 February  3,531 March  4,055 April  3,830 May  2,457 Total  15,998  Average number of residents 26,66.33     ordinary deaths        1.87 per thousand.    plague cases        1.62

122                             CHAPTER VI.                     DISCRETIONAL RELIEF.        The origin of the Discretional Relief Fund, its purposes and the methods of its distribution have been very fully described in previous annual reports.        The decrease in the total amount of expenditure on Discretional Re- lief this year can only be accounted for by the abolition of compulsory measures.  Mr. Lund's   Report.        Mr. Lund most kindly continued to look after the distribution of the  fund in the  three  principal hospitals-the Arthur Road, Mahratta and  Modikhana--and his report is given below: -                             Total for Three Hospitals.       Convalescents   Rs.1,632    4 0 Contacts     "  49       15 3 Clothing, Biscuits, Fruits, etc.     "  1,935     3 0                                                             Rs.3,617     6 3                                                                            I have dispensed the Fund upon the same lines as in previous years by which much distress has been relieved and the lot of the unfortunate sufferers greatly alleviated.      Typical cases of severe distress have again come under notice which it is not necessary to recapitulate in detail.      Contacts have not been sent to the hospital camps since February last, and removal to hospital no longer being compulsory there has been much less demand upon the Fund this year.     Voluntary admissions still continue numerous.     The supply of clothing, biscuits, fruits, etc., and the money given on leaving, to provide the means of obtaining immediate food and shelter are very greatly appreciated.     Having been a constant visitor to the hospitals for more than 2 years, I may be permitted perhaps to bear testimony to the devotion and zeal in the discharge of their duties, and great kindness which the nurses show to the patients.     This also in a great measure no doubt contributes to removing the prejudice against hospitals, which is to a great extent dying out.                                                          GEORGE LUND,                                                Official Plague Hospital Visitor.

Khan Saheb Bhimjibhoy Rustomji Ashburner has always been active and energetic and has done real good work and never misses a day. He has worked for the past four years and in March last he caught plague and was confined to bed from 15th March to 8th April very nearly dead. I visited him repeatedly during his illness and only the best of nursing and medical attendance saved his life. He is gone on leave and will be a great loss to the Ward.

This does not include the Special Medical Officer or his Assistant, the Deputy Commissioner, the Military Officers, or the Lady Nurses, who are all paid by Government. The District Officers are unanimous in their opinion of the good work done by the Sectional Medical Officers during the year under report. They refer to the willing manner in which it was carried out, and to the tact displayed by them in their complex and varied duties. The staff en- gaged on disinfection work cheerfully responded to the heavy calls made upon them, readily adopted improved methods of disinfection, showed promptitude in execution of orders and thoroughness in the actual work itself. The great improvement which was noticed in verification and disin- fection though largely assisted by the removal of compulsory measures must also in great part be attributed to the energy, tact, and sympathy evinced by the plague staff generally in all its dealings with the people. Misconduct was rare. One Sub-inspector was dismissed for dis- honesty in B Ward, South. Another inspector was removed from F & G Wards, his services being dispensed with for irregular conduct and neglect of duty. When the epidemic commenced to rage the work of disinfection was exceedingly heavy and extra gangs and inspectors had to be engaged at very short notice, a considerable number of the latter were found unsuitable for the work and their services had to be dispensed with after a short probation. In C Ward there were 2 or 3 cases of coolies . who attempted theft but owing to the close supervision exercised were caught red-handed and dealt with by the Police and the Magistrates. Conspicuous amongst the staff for zeal and thoroughness were the inspectors of disinfection in C Ward, Central District, Wari Bunder and A Ward. The clerical staff worked specially well in Central District, C Ward, A Ward and Byculla District. Some of the registration ramosis were removed for neglect of duty, but as a body they did very good work indeed. A few ambulance coolies were punished for neglecting to obey orders in the transport of patients to hospitals, but no complaints were made against them by the people. A considerable number   of the plague staff had been inoculated and there are no reliable instances,   of  any one having caught plague within     the period during which the serum is considered to be efficacious. There were two deaths amongst inspectors and 14 amongst the coolies on the staff due to plague. Of the latter class there were about a dozen attacked with plague who recovered. The labours of the staff were not limited to plague. They assisted equally in the heavy small-pox and cholera epidemics with which the season was marked. They helped those attacked with medicines and advice, and carefully removed them to hospitals. They disinfected the infected rooms exactly as in plague, and undertook this extra work without a murmur.    33

139      CHAPTER IX.   __________MISCELLANEOUS. MISCELLANEOUS.    Attitude of the People.         The plague staff met with no actual opposition in the course of their work, although in a few instances, objections were raised to disinfection.       Verification of the cause of death was carried out strictly in accord- ance with the orders and every death the cause of which could not be determined not to be due to plague was treated as such and the place disinfected.  This measure met with a certain amount of obstruction and wordy warfare, but in every case the orders were carried out and the people resigned themselves to the inevitable disinfection.       In other ways the plague staff maintained cordial relations with the people who no longer bore any feelings of mistrust and dislike towards them. In many cases the people have shown that they appreciate the measures of disinfection and evacuation,-the former they have applied for and even carried out themselves and the latter is becoming yearly more popular.    Those who can afford to do so now leave their homes on the approach of the epidemic season and proceed to live in the suburbs until the decline of plague sets in, when they return.       Owing to the regular annual recurrence of the epidemic the people have grown so accustomed to plague that there is absolutely no panic of any kind, business, work, pleasure all proceed just as in ordinary course, but the abolition of compulsory measures has in considerable degree help- ed to bring about these beneficial results, and drawn off from     plague generally the attention which was at one time so keenly rivetted on it.       The supervision of the staff employed on plague duty by Staff Corps officers who understand the people, their language and customs has been the chief cause, perhaps, for promoting the feelings of good will and sympathy now existing between the people and themselves.    History of some Badly   Infected   Houses.         A     WARD.-The following are the worst infected houses :-      No. 24, Goa Street.-Inhabitants are low caste Hindus. Ground-floor is damp, due to over-flow of water where the people bathe and wash their clothes.  Grain and tobacco are sold on the ground floor.     No. 40, Goa Street.-Inhabitants are poor Hindus, Marathas and Barots. The house has been built on a good plinth, the ground floor is dry and well ventilated. The Barots who work in the docks probably catch infection there, and their filthy mode of living is the probable cause for the bad reputation this house has for plague.     No. 92, Cochin Street.-Inhabitants are Mahars and Mangs, who get their living by begging or prostitution. The house is built on a good plinth but the open gutters for waste water are not properly cemented and this is the cause of the damp condition of the ground floor, where most of the plague cases occur.     87, Frere Road.-Inhabitants are low caste poor Hindus. The ground-floor is damp and not properly cemented, and the ventilation is very bad. The passages and latrines are usually filthy and the open space at the back is full of street refuse and the stench at times is almost unbearable.
140 No. 22, C. Frere Road.-Inhabitants are low caste people,-Mahomedans, Mahars and Marathas. They comprise barbers, dhobies, domestic servants and boatmen. The house is a fairly gcod one, but cases are frequently found, and it is presumed that the infection is caught outside and imported into the house.  No. 32, Carwar Street.-Inhabitants are poor Marathas and Purdesis, mostly employed as cart drivers. The grcund-floor is damp, and is on a level with the road, being neither paved nor cemented. The top floor has a low roof without windows and no ventilation. There are four shops on the ground-floor occupied by grain dealers.  No. 5, Chawl, Victoria Bunder, was built in 1900 and only about half of it remains occupied. Inhabitants are Ghatis who live a hand to mouth existence. The chawl is well built, the latrines are outside and perhaps as they are a little distance off, the tenants do not care to use them but defile their bathing places and the ground outside. The place is badly overcrowded owing to the high rents charged.  No. 3, Chawl, Victoria Bunder, is similar in all respects to No. 5, Chawl.  No. 65-67, Thomas Street.-Inhabitants are Ghatis and Fishermen who though poor can earn their living. There are many small rooms, plastered with cow-dung. Most of the cases occur on the ground floor and top floor. Many of the inhabitants sleep on cots, but the sanitary arrangements are bad.  No. 7, Thomas Street.-This is a wretched house, low built and badly ventilated and dark. It has, however, been pulled down.  No. 45, Thomas Street.-This house was condemned in 1899, and although it was re- built in 1900 it is quite one of the worst houses. The latrines are so placed that all the air entering this house first passes through them and the ground-floor rooms are dark and ill ventilated. The vicinity of the house is always filthy.  No. 201, Pilot Bunder, has had a very bad record in the past, but not so last year.  B WARD, SOUTH.-- Dr. Matthai, the Sectional Medical Officer of this district, reports as follows :-  Coorla. Street, No. 45.-This is a three-storied house built in two blocks. Total deaths from all causes since June 1st 1899 up to date were 87 of which 54 were plague and suspicious. The total number of inhabitants usually living in the house is about 300, and they are very poor working people of the Maratha caste. The house is not built on a plinth, the ground floor is very low and on a level with the street and is used for grain shops, etc., and for godowns. The inhabitants without any exception sleep on the floor. The people are cart drivers and coolies. The house is very insanitary. The drains are open and produce offensive odours. The rooms are overcrowded and ill ventilated. The house was vacated more than once, and the people were sent to the Dana Bunder Segregation Camp without any difficulty. As there were repeated attacks of plague after evacuation a report was sent to the Health Officer remarking on the insanitary condi- tion of the house and suggesting certain changes.  Surat Street, No. 66.-Total deaths from all causes since June 1st 1899 up to date were 85 ; of which 51 were plague. The total number of inhabitants usually living in the house is about 276 and they are working classes of the Maratha caste. The house is built on a plinth, about 2 ft. from the street level. The ground floor is not inhabited but used as a gum godown, where every day a dozen coolies are engaged in cleaning the gum. The inmates being poor sleep on the ground. The rooms except those facing the street on one side are dark and ill ventilated but every room without any exception is over crowded. This house was partly vacated on 3rd April 1901 and after that there were no plague cases on that floor; but on the other hand there were several deaths on the other floors.

WARI BUNDER.-Dr.Nerurkar, Sectional Medical Officer, reports on some of the worst infected houses as follows : Mazagon-37, Narielwady Village.-One floored-house with a simple big loft running over all the rooms. Total number of deaths from 1st June 1899 to 1st June 1901 was 19, out of which 12 occurred during the year under report. The total number of inhabitants is about 50, being poor Mahomedans, working in the docks. The house is built on plinth, The floor is made of cow-dung and the walls are of bricks, planks being used in some places. The rooms stand back to back; and there is absolutely no ventilation. in some rooms, and the loft is quite without light.
143 Tarwadi-41-45, Nesbit Lane.-These consist of three big chawls with the rooms standing back to back. Total number of deaths from 1st June 1899t o 1st June 1901, was 91, out of which 48 occurred during the year under report. Total number of inhabitants is about 400 poor Mahars working as dock labourers. Thev are not built on plinth and are below the level of the road; floors made of cow-dung and the partitions (which are incomplete) of bamboos and mud. The rooms are ill ventilated and dark.      12, Byramjee Hall Lane.-This is a big chawl with 5 floors. Total number of deaths  from June 1899 to 1st June 1901 was 53, out of which 49 occurred during the year under  report. Total number of inhabitants is about 500, mostly pcor Hindus of the Maratha  caste, who work as dock labourers and mill bands. It is built on plinth, floors being made  of chunam and the partitions of bricks. In some places partitions are of corrugated iron.  Rooms are well ventilated and properly lighted.       32, Parel Road.-This consists of seven small one-floored houses. Total number of  deaths from June 1899 to 1st June 1901 was 53, out of which 37 occurred during the year  under report. Total number of inhabitants about 300, poor Hindus of the Maratha caste,  working as mill hands. They are built on plinth; floors being made of cow-dung and  partitions of bricks.  In some places partitions are made of Bamboos.  Rooms are  damp, dirty and ill ventilated.  The open plot of ground, close to these houses, is  kept very filthy.       Mazagon-39, Ambewady.-This is a small house with two floors. Total number of deaths from June 1899 to 1st June 1901 was 36, out of which 29 occurred during the year under report. Total number of inhabitants is about 150, poor Marathas, mostly mill hands. It is built on plinth; floor being of cow-dung and partitions of planks. The rooms on the ground floor are very badly lighted. The rooms on the second floor are only 4 ft. in height and are not properly lighted.        Capt. Moore remarks as follows with regard to three        houses in this  (Wari Bunder) district:-      House No, 37, Narelwadi Village and No. 61, Matharpakhady belonging to Mrs. Mis-  quitta consist of ground-floor and one story reached by a ladder; floors being of mud, and  partitions bamboo plastered with cow-dung, There are ten small rooms, none of which fulfill  in any way the regulations of the Health Department regarding light, size, ventilation,  height, &c. Between 15th April and 9th May there have been 18 cases of plague in this  house, in spite of repeated disinfection, among about 50 people. These houses are now  completely vacated and have been thoroughly disinfected and locked up, I have suggested  they should be pulled down, also the hovel standing next to it.       31, De Lima Street, Parsee house.-This is a three-storied building, with healthy sorroundings. It is built on a plinth with walls of brick, and chunam floor. Ventilation is good in front rooms, but not so good at back. Family consists of 10, including children and servants.  Plague death occurred on 3rd February, 1901. Disinfection was delayed for " Chaharum" Ceremony for three days. Second death occurred on 6th February, 1901. Disinfection in the room where deaths had occurred was carried out by Fakirji Rustomji Camp-master, and Sub-inspector Bhandara, both Parsees, in order to avoid delay. Third plague death took place on 8th February 1901. The inhabitants were removed to camp on the 8th and the whole house was completely disinfected on the 10th. Out of contacts one man developed severe pneumonic plague and died within a few hours being too ill to remove to Hospital. One girl developed bubonic plague the same day, but reco- vered, being kept in camp by special permission,         F & G WARDS.-In        Parel Section the worst infected houses are       Nos. 59, 69, 70 and 72, Curry Road; 7 and 8, Lalwadi; No. 8, Tulsiram Pada; No.  355, Arthur Road; Nos. 5 and 31, Kalachowki Road; No. 20, Chor Gully; No. 3, Curry  Road; Nos. 326, 328, 188 and 189, De Lisle Road; and No. 158, Arthur Road.
144       These houses. are all inhabited by poor people, the flooring mostly of mud and cow-dung and noted for faulty drainage, want of ventilation, darkness, and dampness. Overcrowding is the worst feature of all the places mentioned which are inhabited mostly by mill.hands.        CENTRAL DISTRICT.-There are some notorious Plague houses in this district and amongst the worst the following take a foremost place       Umarkhadi and Chuckla Section:-No. 2-12/244, 2nd Donted Nos. 52 and 54, Narayan Dhuroo Street; No. 13, Memonwada Cross Lane; No. 4 Nos. 22 and 24, Mahomed Khan Pakhadi 1st Cross Lane; Nos. 21 and 23, Old Nagpada Street; No. 524, Nagdevi Road.       These houses are mostly inhabited by Ghatis and one or two by poor Mahomedans.  Their occupation is hawking, daily labour and the Mahomedans are weavers.        In  2nd Nagpada the worst houses are reported upon by    Mr. Jen.  nings, the Sectional Medical Officer as follows :-       No. 104,  Tank Street.-A four storied house occupied by Julahis and Mahomedan  Hindustanis was badly infected in the early part of February 1901.  What was strange  about it was that the epidemic was confined to the fourth floor only, and in two weeks  there were more than 22 cases. The method of disinfection at present in vogue was tried  but without success.  Above the fourth floor was a wooden loft, in which dust, the ac-  cumulation of nine years, was collected. On the 20th February Dr. Fraser, the C. M. O.  of the District with two gangs under Inspectors Jennings and Ferozdeen, thoroughly  disinfected the loft and first floor. While removing the dust and dirt twenty-six dead rats  were found. Every inch of the loft and ceiling was most carefully done under the direct  supervision of Dr. Fraser, the gangs working without intermission from  7 a.m. to 7 p.m.  This house has had no recrudescence since. The fourth floor was partly vacated during  the outbreak.        177, Grant Road.-Its history from  1st June 1899 to 31st 1900.-The House   Register shows 12 attacks and 12 deaths from plague. The population of the chawl was   about 3 times as many as it is to-day, and 9/10ths were inoculated. From 1st June 1900 to   6th March 1901   there were 7 attacks and 8 deaths ; of the former 5 were removed to   hospital and recovered (they were all inoculated) ; the 8 deaths were amongst new comers.   only. The house was vacated on two occasions, 1st on the 16th January 1899 and second   on the 19th March 1900.        The attached history of the epidemic from the 7th March 1901 speaks for itself, and   to the merits of inoculation and isolation. 38 contacts were removed to the Umerkhadi Camp   on the morning of the 18th March and one old woman died the same evening. In the morn-   ing she was well and only arrived from her country the day before. In one room out of the   sixteen persons 5 died. The great difficulty was to disinfect the place; in every room some one   was isolated. I could only manage to send one man to hospital. I reported the matter   and asked for permission to resort to our former method and anticipating the sanction   had the Municipal reel in on the 15th and 16th and washed the whole chawl out from   ceiling to base two days in succession and then had it thoroughly disinfected with   the mercurial solution.         60-62, Huzria Mohla.-This house was badly infected, in the second week in January    1901. There were no less than 6 cases in two days, 5 of which succumbed and one    recovered. The vicinity adjoining this house was immediately attacked and the plague    epidemic after passing through Huzria Mohla went on to Temker and Telly Mohlas. This    was the real commencement of the last epidemic in the section. The houses are two storied,    ill ventilated and in a dilapidated condition. The ground floors are occupied by Hindu    Mochies and the upper floor by Mahomedans. The ground floors were vacated and the    house thoroughly disinfected and kept vacant for about a month, and only allowed to be    re-occupied after sundry repairs being completed.
145      529, Duncan Road.-This is the largest chawl in the section with a population vary- ing from 1,000 to 1,400 souls. The occupants are of every caste and creed. The chawl is a double one, the front portion being occupied by a better class than the rear one. This chawl with its low caste Hindu population contributed largest number of deaths towards the epidemic from the time of its outbreak in 1896. It was seriously affected both by the cholera and small-pox epidemic which raged during the early part of the year. The total mortality in this chawl for the year was 147, 66 of which were plague cases but out of the latter number only 8 recovered.       The reports on the worst infected houses show         that amongst other working people, barbers suffer considerably, from plague. Another noti- ceable point is that houses situated close to buffalo stables and sheds appear to be singularly open to plague infection.    Roadside   Cases.         The following table shows the number of roadside cases removed to hospitals and the number of deaths amongst them from plague and from causes other than plague.  The greatest number it will be seen occurred in the Central District, where beggars and destitutes wandered about in search of alms and food. Starvation, cholera, diarrha and dysentery were the chief causes to which the mortality amongst them was due.       Only occasionally it was found that people sick with plague had been turned out of their houses. Before the Grant Road Hospital was opened great difficulty was found in accommodating patients removed to hospitals as most of these were full. The greater portion of these cases occurred among beggars and homeless people,-famine immigrants-who came chiefly from Kathiawar, Gujerat and the Konkan.

Captain Smith gives his opinion as follows regarding plague marks on houses in C Ward:-     The marks on houses have many advantages. They are an instant guide to the plague staff in ascertaining houses that are badly infected and they are of the very greatest assistance to District Officers and other Supervising Officers when going their rounds checking and overlooking disinfection operations.     37
146       Intelligent people as a rule avoid, if possible, taking lodgings in houses or floors, etc., that have got plague marks on them.       The landlords are well aware of this and invariably take the first opportunity to wash out these marks and so give their houses an appearance of having been free from plague.       Landlords knowing the preference people have to living in houses free from plague or former bad plague history charge very much higher rents for these houses.       Moreover, they will not take in people who have come from infected houses. These marks are very useful and enable the S. M. O.'s to keep in touch with the rooms in which suffering cases are kept.       As most of the houses inhabited by the poorer classes have had plague at some time  or another they do not appear to take very much notice of these marks. Though doubtless  if they were in a position to do so they would probably prefer to live in non-infected quarters.       There is a belief amongst the intelligent classes that a room once infected is always infected and that in a room, etc., in which cases have occurred one year, cases may be ex- pected in future years.      I think, on the whole, that the system  of marking the houses should be continued, although there is no way or rule, etc., in force with which they can be prevented from rubbing out or effacing these marks.    The Verifi- cation Work.          Lieut. Shakespeare      reports   on   the  verification   work which was exceedingly heavy in his Ward            and was carried    out most thoroughly by Dr. Matthai.       He also comments upon         the attitude of the people towards plague     measures and the effect of         plague marks on      houses as follows :-      Verification in this district has always been carried out very rapidly and is reliable. Every death not verified by a recognised practitioner, is treated as suspicious, unless seen by the Sectional Medical Officer either before or after death. Delay was only due in a few cases where a certificate was promised and not brought for a few days. In the cases of still- born infants, the Sectional Medical Officer nearly always examined the mother, to prevent any deception practised in this way.       The people as a rule are afraid of asking aid from the plague doctor, being under the impression that he will put down every sick person as suffering from  plague and will then disinfect. In this district, however, they have come round to the view that the doctor will treat them for other diseases as well as plague, and that gratis, which is an undoubted advantage in the average native mind.       There is no doubt that the people of this district have realized and appreciate the advantages of reporting their cases of sickness to the Sectional Medical Officer and this, of course, is due to the efforts of the Sectional Medical Officer himself. Needless to say that all the plague staff when sick call upon him for treatment.       The attitude of the people towards plague measures appears to be resignation, rather  than anything else. They help by reporting cases, also occasionally attempt to conceal  cases, but when disinfection has been ordered, they accept it without much opposition and  with the air of making the most of a bad job.       Plague marks on the walls of houses, in the opinion of most volunteers do not affect  the rent. They say rents have risen all over Bombay without any difference between infected  and non-infected houses. Sometimes a plague mark is whitewashed over; but it would  make but little difference if they were all whitewashed over. The marks are supposed to be  for the use of the plague staff; but the staff invariably refers to the house registers if  anything is required about a particular house. In fact, the plague mark is only an. un-  necessary expenditure of paint and money.
147    Bandora Slaughter   Houses.          Dr. Fazl    Ahmed reports as follows upon            plague at the Bandora Slaughter Houses, and his remarks about the great assistance                 rendered by   Khan    Bahadur Abdul Razak           and   the  other volunteers are     fully justified :-       The population of the compound according to the last Census is 518. The bulk of the population is made up of Mahomedan butchers working in the Slaughter House.  They live in barracks built for them in the compound. These people are very rude, ignorant, very excitable and turbulent.  Their habits are very dirty and their mode of living very unhygenic.       Notwithstanding all these disadvantages, the year under report has been a very lucky one, as far as the health of the population is concerned. The total mortality for the year was 18.   There occurred 5 plague cases this year of which 3 ended fatally, one recovered and one is suffering still. He is on a fair way to recover, and is making a slow but steady improvement.       The disease has hitherto confined itself to the butchers only and has not attacked the  chawls of the Begaris, who are Hindoos of low castes, Dhers, and Mahars.  As the habits  of these people are very dirty and as they walk about naked and insufficiently clad, they  present almost unlimited opportunities for the entrance into their tissues of the plague  poison by inoculation through cuts and abrasions.  Over and above this, their dwellings are  very insanitary and overcrowded and consequently the disease spreads with alarming speed  when once imported. Fortunately the disease did not attack the chawls of these people  this year.        Great attention was paid to improve the barracks, during the year under report.  People were advised time after time to keep their houses clean and let the fresh air in.  The  danger of the disease breaking out as an epidemic was imminent and grew every day more  and more, as the plague was raging in the town of Bandora and especially in a locality of  the town known as Wadi where the relations of the butchers are living.  Precautionary  measures were adopted and the population kept under strict observation.       The butchers objected very strongly against the removal of their patients to the Hos-  pital and hence they were allowed to keep them   at their houses, on condition that they  vacated the adjoining rooms.  The rooms were thoroughly disinfected including the kit and  household effects, before the inmates were allowed to re-occupy their rooms.  The measure  proved very effectual as there occurred not a single case of re-infection in these houses.        The work is not easy among these people who look upon all our measures as ridiculous   and the disinfection as an uncalled for annoyance.  Difficult, as the work really was, it was   considerably facilitated by the timely and the materially useful help given by the volunteers,   Messrs. Alikhan Shahabuddin and Mahomed Kasum. They helped on every occasion,   and their influence and popularity smoothed the path and action could be taken completely   peacefully and quietly.  Their services require a special recognition.        Khan Bahadur Abdul Razak bin Kurtas, the Chairman of the  Bandora Slaughter   House Volunteer Commitee, deserves much credit, as through his tact and skill, he kept   the volunteers in union with each other and constantly drew their attention towards their   duties. Though living at Bombay, he showed a deep interest in the welfare of the people   in the Slaughter House and kept himself well informed of the state of afairs throughout the   year. He paid a visit to the place whenever required.

152 (3) Since the abolition of compulsory removal of plague cases to hospitals, the admissions into the Community Hospitals have fallen off considerably, and a large number of those which were open last year did not admit any cases during the year under report. The Municipal Hospitals, however, retained their popularity, and the returns show a large amount of good work performed. (4) The principal Municipal Hospitals were the Arthur Road Hospital under Khan Bahadur Dr. N. H. Choksey, the Maratha Hospital under Dr. Dhargalkar, the Modikhana Hospital under Dr. Turkhad, and the Mahin Hospital under Dr. Dady Burjor. The Municipality also maintained some wards for Mahrattas in the Hindu Fever Hospital for the whole of the period under report, and the Sunni Julahi and General Mohamedan Hospitals (Madanpura and Northbrook Gardens respectively) for a part of that period. The two last were closed at the end of January 1901, and the patients, with some of the establishments and the equipment, were sent to the Maratha Hospital, which had been converted into a General Plague Hospital, and, in which, ample facilities existed for providing separate accommodation for different communities. The scheme of in-corporating these three hospitals into one worked satisfactorily. (5) 2,400 plague cases were admitted into the four principal Municipal Hospitals during the year, and besides these, 2,170 cases of Relapsing Fever and 785 cases of Cholera. In addition, the Arthur Road Hospital admitted 95 cases of Small-pox, 10 of Measles and 74 of Chicken-pox. (6) Appended below are condensed summaries of the reports of each of the Medical Officers in charge of the Municipal and private hospitals, together with tables furnishing Statistical details regarding the cases admitted into each. For the purposes of this report, however, the statistical points in the following paragraph are taken from the returns of the four principal Municipal hospitals only, as they show the largest amount of regular work done, and are more generally reliable in detail than those from many of the others, some of which were not wholly in charge of fully qualified Medical men. (7) The case mortality from Plague was 74.48 per cent.; the percentage of mortality among males 63.17, among females 59.98 and among children 51.46; that among infants below 1 year of age 28.87; among persons in each successive decade up to 40 years of age 55.84, 70.27, 70.74 and 68.12; and among persons above 40 years of age 77.71; that in Pneumonic Plague 98.07; and that in Bubonic Plague complicated by secondary Pneumonia 75.66. (8) We are not in a much better position to judge, further, regarding the effects of Professor Lustig's Curative Serum this year than we were last year, wing to the fact that only a limited number of experiments was possible during the period under report. This was on account of a dearth of serum owing partly to unavoidable delay in the construction of a suitable venesection jacket for new and restive horses and the procuring of some necessary apparatus from Europe, and, partly, to the fact that the unusual virulence in the type of the disease during this epidemic, rendered it necessary that at least three times the quantity of serum as was found to be sufficient for each case last year was required this year before any visible result could be obtained. As will be seen from the details in the summaries of the reports of the Arthur Road and Maratha Hospitals below, the treatment gave better results than other methods of treatment, but the advantage gained was less than in previous years, being only 1.53 per cent. at the Arthur Road, and 4.59 per cent. at the Maratha Hospital. These results, however, are not to be despised, especially when it is remembered that the advantage gained at the Maratha Hospital was at a time when the percentage of mortality among cases treated by other methods was 88.8. The treatment acts best in cases where there are not
153 multiple buboes, and which are not septicmic in character on admission. During the year under report 43 per cent. of the cases in the serum group at the Arthur Road Hospital were septicmic in character, and the number of cases with multiple buboes was over four times as great as the average number of such cases in preceding epidemics. Although the percentage of cases, however, in which death was averted by the serum was less than in previous years, yet the clinical histories show that, in many of the fatal cases in the serum group, life was pro- longed and acute symptoms ameliorated to a considerable extent. A detailed report by Dr. Chokesy together with a note from Dr. Polverini is appended to this report. (9) Two cases in the Maratha Hospital were treated by Terni and Bandi's serum, a specimen of which was sent for trial through Government. The cases were selected in consultation with Major Bannerman, Capt. Lamb and Mons. Haffkine, but both proved fatal. (10) 7 cases of plague were treated with Iodine Terchloride in the Mahim Hospital, but all died, 2 in the Parsee Fever Hospital both of which died, 6 in the Maratha Hospital all of which died, 34 in F and G Wards of which 28 died, 62 at the Arthur Road Hospital of which 40 died, and 151 in the Hindu Fever Hospital of which 110 died. (11) Drs. Velkar, Turkhad, Choksey, Dhargalkar and Dady Burjor draw attention in their reports to points of clinical interest which have been observed by them. These points will be found in the summaries of their reports below. (12) Much of the success in the Hospitals, as well as their continued popularity, was due to the untiring efforts of the Medical Officers in charge and their Assistants especially those of Drs. Choksey, Turkhad, Dhargalkar, Dady Burjor, Velkar and Trilokekar; Messrs. Divatia, Samuel Benjamin and Suntoji Ramji; Hospital Assistants Bhikabhai Haribhai and Maganlal Motilal Shah; Messrs. DeSilva and Shankar Waman, Hakim Din Mohamad Rahiman and K. S. Abdulla Hiptoola Misri and Vaidya Gungaram Dharmaji. (13) The assistance rendered by Dr. E. S. Winter when the work was very heavy at the Maratha Hospital was most valuable, and was undertaken by him in addition to his own duties which, at the time, required most of his attention. (14) Of the Nursing Staff unstinted praise is due to Miss Green, the Lady Superintendent, to the Misses Tanner, Boyd, Richardson, Rait, Steer, Massey, Aukett, Hodgson, Reddick, Poole, Johnstone, Jessop, Coulson, Marshall, Goldney, Smith, Crowdy, Duff, Hare Scott, MacIntosh, Corchane, Rose, Krkham, Platts, Robourgh, Corbett, Gray, Warrack, A. Boyd, Kendall, Winscome, Goodall and to Mrs. Barr and Mrs. Baker. Their untiring devotion to duty, combined with their cheerfulness and tactfulness, won for them the confidence of their patients, and the esteem of all others with whom they worked. Mrs. Barr, in addition to nursing work, dispensed European medicines at the Sunni Julahi Hospital, under the direction of the Special and Sectional Medical Officers, to members of the Julahi Community, and with that Community she became deservedly very popular, and was transferred with the Sunni Julahi Hospital to the Maratha Hospital. (15) By their generosity and exertions, Rao Bahadurs Dhakji Kashinatji and Narayen Trimbak Vaidya and the late Sirdar Oomar Jamal Vayani contributed much to the success of the measures in the Pathare Prabhu, Hindu Fever and Sunni Julahi Hospitals respectively. (16) As in past years Sirdar Mir Abdul All Khan Bahadur spent most of his leisure time in organising and supervising improvements at the Maratha Hospital, and beautifying the garden. By his exertions all the temporary wards have been rebuilt, serviceable roads and paths made, and swampy ground raised above storm level at a mere nominal cost to the Municipality. 39
154 (17) I would take this opportunity of thanking Capt. Pritchard and all the District Officers for their hearty co-operation and the interest taken by them in the hospitals and the welfare of the patients; and at the same time express my indebtedness to Mr. Waite, the Chief Accountant, for much valuable assistance. (18) The assistance rendered by Drs. Polverini and Mayr in some of the hospitals calls for grateful acknowledgment and, in conclusion, I would place on record my high appreciation of the valuable work of Mr. A. K. Pai, B.A., my Head Clerk and Accountant. By his energy and efforts all the clerical and statistical work of the office has been kept rigidly up to date even during a time when he was in very poor health. W. E. JENNING , M. B. C.

Summaries of Reports of Medical Officers in charge of Hospitals with Tables giving Statistical Details of Cases Admitted. No. 1. Arthur Road Hospital. This hospital is a permanent Municipal Institution and was, for the whole of the period under report, under Khan Bahadur Dr. N. H. Choksey assisted for five months by Dr. D. C. Setllna. Establishment.-The permanent Health Department Establishment not being sufficient to meet the demands caused by plague and relapsing fever, extra establishment had to be provided, and the following strength was maintained when the epidemic of 1900-1901 was at its highest, viz.:- Chief Medical Officer ... ... 1 Lady Nurses ...... ...             3 Local Nurses ... ... ...           4 Hospital Assistants ... ...     3 Store-keeper .........              1 Clerks ... ... ... ...                  2 Compounder ... ... ...          1 Engine-Driver (for Steam Steri- lizer) . ... ... ...                       1 Ward Boys ... ......               39 Ayahs ... ... ...                      12 Cooks ... ... ......                     3 Dhobis ... ... ... ..                   3   Mali ... ... . ....                        1 Bhisti ... .. ... ...                      1 Dispensary Servant ... ...      1 Ambulance Men ... ...          4 Ramosis (for Steam Sterilizer) ... 4 Coolies ...... ....                              2 Sweepers (male and female) ...    23 Accommodation.--The permanent accommodation remained as in previous years but all the temporary wards, with one exception, collapsed and were not rebuilt. There was sufficient accommodation for 200 patients all through the period under report, and this was found to be ample. Disnfection, &c.-Disinfection, Conservancy and Mortuary arrangements remained the same as in previous years. Admissions and Results.-Of 1,970 admissions, 473 (with 360 deaths) proved to be cases of plague, the remainder, 1,497 in number (with 762 deaths), being cases of relapsing fever (625), Cholera (576), Small-pox (95), Chicken-pox (74), Measles (10) and other diseases (117).
155 Sickness and Mortality among Staff. (a) Plague.-3 ward boys were attacked with plague of whom 2 recovered and 1 died. (b) Relapsing Fever.- 1 ward boy and 1 sweeper contracted this disease, but both recovered. (c) Cholera.-1 ward boy was attacked and died Special Treatment.-Iodine Terchloride was used in 62 cases of plague, Of these 40 died, and 22 recovered. A series of experiments was again tried with Professor Lustig's Anti-plague Serum, every alternate one of 206 consecutive admissions being placed in the serum group, the results among the remainder, treated on general principles, serving for comparison. Out of the serum group (of 104) there were 23 recoveries and 81 deaths, and out of the control group (of 102) there were 21 recoveries and 81 deaths. This gives a percentage in favour of the serum treatment of 1.53. This is less than the advantage obtained in previous years, but the type of plague was much more severe this year (a large proportion of the cases being septicemic in character on admission and over 60 per cent. having multiple buboes against an average of about 13 per cent. in previous epidemics), and it was found that at least 3 times the quantity of serum as was found to be sufficient for each case last year was required this year before any visible result was obtained. Clinical Observations.-In his report Dr. Choksey, draws attention to the fact that views expressed by him in a previous report, regarding the unfavourable influence of prophylactic inoculation during the incubation stage of plague, have received further confirmation in a report on plague measures at Ahmadnagar drawn up by Major Sarkies, I. M. S., from which he quotes as follows :-" The mortality from plague among persons inoculated during the incubation stage is higher the sooner after inoculation the disease shows itself. In persons attacked one or two days after inoculation, the chances of recovery are less than those attacked later." During the year Dr. Choksey, with a view of attempting to confer immediate immunity, injected into about 20 persons, belonging to families of plague patients, 20 C. C. each of Curative Serum, and in not one of these did plague subsequently appear. He reports having made close observations regarding the alleged association of relapsing fever with buboes and gives, as his opinion, that the association is not so common as to classify buboes even among the occasional symptoms of relapsing fever. He has observed a hypersthetic condition of the skin which causes patients to wince when pressed in the groins and axill, giving the impression of tenderness over glands, but does not associate this condition with the glands. He admits that parotitis complicates relapsing fever in about 2 or 3 per cent. of the cases, but is of opinion that other glands which are sometimes found inflamed and suppurating, in relapsing fever patients, are merely chronically enlarged glands undergoing such a change in consequence of secondary infection (Streptococens or staphylococcus) following upon a lowered state of vitality. Post Mortem Examiniations.-Several of these were performed during the year, and in cases in which the buboes had been multiple, it was found that the intra abdominal and intra thoracic glands were largely involved, a phenomenon not commonly observed in past epidemics. Statistics.-The following tables furnish statistical information regarding the cases admitted.

This Hospital was opened on the 21st January 1898 by a Committee appointed  by the Maratha Community and Khan Bahadur Sirdar Mir Abdul Alli, and was  originally intended for the use of the Maratha people. The maintenance of the  hospital was subsequently handed over to the late Bombay Plague Committee, and  then to the Bombay Municipality and all classes are now admitted. The situation               of  the hospital, the accommodation, the conservancy, disinfection and mortuary             arrange-  ments have been fully described in the Reports for 1898-1899 and 1899-1900.   Several of the old temporary wards have been rebuilt this year by Sirdar Mir  Abdul Alli, and the permanent and temporary wards now afford accommodation for  550 patients.   Staff.-Throughout the period under report Dr. L. B. Dhargalkar was in  charge of this hospital. For about a month when the pressure of work was very  heavy, Dr. E. S. Winter was given charge of the observation wards to relieve  Dr. Dhargalkar. Eleven English Nursing Sisters, viz., Misses Richardson, Corbett,  Gray, Johnstone, Rait, Marshall, Poole, Steer, Platts, Hodgson and Boyd and one
165 Local Nurse, Mrs. Barr, worked here during the year. Mr. Suntoji Ramji was the House Surgeon, Messrs. Rahiman and Din Mohamad the Hakims, and Mr. G. Dharmaji the Vaidya. In addition to the above there were, when the staff was at its maximum, 2 Hospital Assistants, 3 Compounders, 1 Vaidva's Assistant, 1 Ha- kim's Assistant, 1 Office Peon, 1 Store Boy, 3 Cooks, 1 Poultice Boy, 2 Corpse Bearers, 1 Masal, 1 Bhisti,3 Dhobies, 27 Ward Boys, 18 Ayahs, 29 Sweepers, 2 Ramosis, 36 Coolies, 1 Store Clerk and 1 Telephone and Registering Clerk. Inoculated Cases.-There were no inoculated cases among the plague cases admitted into the hospital during the year under report. Sickness and Mortality among Members of the Staff-Eleven of the Staff fell ill during the year under report. 3 with Plague, 3 with Relapsing fever, 2 with Cholera, 1 with Peurperal fever, 1 with Remittent fever and 1 with Lobular Pneu- mnonia. Of these 6 died, viz., .3 Plague cases, 1 Peurperal fever case, 1 Remittent fever case and 1 Pnenumonia case. Chages during the Year.-The General Mohamedan Hospital, Northbrook Gardens, and the Sunni Julahi Mohamedan Hospital, Ripon Road, were incorporated with this hospital on the 1st of February 1901, when 4 Plague, 1 Relapsing fever and 8 Observation cases were sent from the General Mohamedan Hospital, and 17 Plague, 1 Relapsing fever and 11 Observation cases from the Sunni Julahi Mohamedan Hospital. These patients were permitted to have native treatment if they desired it, and were accommodated separately from Hindus and other castes.  Orphans.-During the period under report 20 unclaimed orphans remained in the hospital, either on account of the death of their parents, or by their parents or guardians deserting them. One died, 11 were sent to the Lady Northcote Orphan- age, and enquiries were still being made about 8 at the end of the period under report. Admisions and Results.-The total number of admissions during the year under review was 3,599 against 4,722 in the previous year. Of these 3,599 cases, 2,71 2 were sent by District Officers and other Plague Authorities (including 51 from His Majesty's Common Prison) and 887 came of their own accord. 71 patients were sent for observation from the Modilkhant Segregation Camp by the Port Health Officer, of which, 4 turned out to e Plague, 3 Cholera and 14 Relapsing fever. Of 185 persons sent as contacts, 9 developed Plague and 1 Cholera. Out of the total number of admissions 1,277 proved to be Plague cases, and of these 999 proved fatal. Among the remainder there were 995 cases of Relapsing fever, 1 of Small-pox, 3 of Chicken-pox, 1 of Measles and 130 of Cholera. Of the Plague cases, 105 were under the treatment of the Native Vaidya attached to the hospital. and 174 under that of the Hakim. Of the former, 11, and of the latter, 53 recovered. Clinical Obserrtions.-Among Clinical Observations submitted by the Medical Officer in charge. he records the case of one pregnant female who suffered from plague, and was discharged cured, her gestation proceeding uninterruptedly till the full term. There were only 7 other pregnant plague cases and they all aborted. He observes that cases with left axillav buboes are very fatal, as are also cases complicated by persistent vomiting. He records 34 cases of Plague Pneumo- nia and 106 Bubonic cases complicated by Pneumonia. This form during the period under report, appears to have been most common in February. Hmorrhage was observed in 27 of his cases, all of which proved fatal. In 2 of these there were petechi on the shoulders and back. In three instances he found plague complicated by relapsing fever. Treatment.-The main treatment adopted Was the stimulant form and complications were treated according to indications. 42
?166 Lustig's Curative Serum Treatment.-A small number of experiments with Lustig's serum was tried at this hospital, 38 cases in all being treated during the months of November and December 1900, and January 1901. Owing, however, to the quantity of serum being limited, and the fact that the Chief Medical Officer was so busy, as to be unable to devote sufficient personal attention to ensure that the experiments were being conducted scientifically, it was decided to abandon them for a while at this hospital. Details of the cases treated, with charts, are appended to this report, and the Chief Medical Officer sums up the results of the experiments as compared with cases treated on the stimulant plan as follows :- Percentage of mortality   among    serum  cases   8421.   Do. do. stimulant cases 888. These results, judging from the high mortality in both groups, and especially in the Non Serum group, serve to indicate that the type of the plague in those months must have been extremely virulent, notwithstanding which, the serum group shows a higher recovery rate by 44 per cent. than the Stimulant or Control group. Two cases were treated by Terni and Bandi's serum, a specimen of which was sent for trial through Government. The cases were selected in consultation with Major Bannerman, Capt. Lamb and Mons. Haffkine but both, proved fatal. Other Special Treatment.-Iodine Terchloride was tried in 6 cases. The cases chosen were all acute and had well developed buboes and all died within 4 days. Statistics.-The following tables furnish statistical details of the cases admitted-appended to the report is a statement giving details of cases treated with Lustig's Curative Serum with 38 clinical charts of these cases.

The necessary clothing, &c., was supplied as usual from their funds, and Mr. Jiwanjee Jamshedji Mody, the Secretary of the Panchayet, always took a keen interest in the Parsee patients. Messrs. Kanga and Company supplied rated waters to the Parsee Ward free of charge. Cholera Ward.-A Cholera Ward was opened on the 22nd July 1900, and kept open until the 27th September. 44 cases of Cholera were treated during the period.

? 176  Disinfection.-The floors of all the Wards were disinfected with phenyle and the ward clothing was disinfected as in previous years in the Modikhana Steam Sterilizer every morning before being handed over to the Dhobies for being- washed. Disposal of the Dead.-The method of the disposal of the dead was the same as in previous years. Inoculated Cases.-The following table gives all the important particulars as regards the cases that had been inoculated with the Plague Prophylactic and were subsequently admitted into this hospital suffering either from Plague or other diseases.

?177 It will be seen from this that out of the 14 cases admitted seven were found to be suffering from Plague, and the rest from various other diseases. Out of the seven admitted for Plague six died, and one was discharged cured. Out of the six that died the exact date of inoculation could not be ascertained in two cases, while the remaining four had been inoculated more than 8 months before admission. Clinical Notes.-Among clinical points of interest, Dr. Turkhud records two phyctenular cases, both of which ended fatally. He had one case of Pneumonic Plague in which hmoptysis was absent, and he observes that when hmoptysis occurs in the Secondary Pneumonia of Relapsing fever it is more profuse than in Plague hmoptysis. Of three pregnant females attacked with plague, two aborted and died, but the third made a good recovery from the Plague in spite of miscarriage in the eighth month ; unfortunately, however, when about to be discharged, she caught a chill, which in her weak state, led to Pneumonia which ended fatally. Her chart is appended to this report. Lustig's Serum.-Two cases were treated during the year with this serum one of which died, and one recovered. The charts of the cases are appended to this report.

The District Officer (Central District) considered the move an unpopular one because of the greater distance of            the Maratha Hospital from the locality than of the old Hospital, but up to the end   of the period under report the wards reserved for this community remained full, and patients were allowed to have native treatment if they desired it. Staff.-Throughout the period the Hospital was in charge of Hakim Din Mahomed, who employed native methods of treatment, and Nurse Barr, who, under supervision of the Special Medical and Sectional Medical Officers, dispensed European medicines. They were assisted by 6 Ward boys, 3 Ayahs, one Cook and 4 Sweepers. Accommodation, &c. - The accommodation and the conservancy, disinfection and mortuary arrangements remained the same as in previous years. Throughout the period the late Sirdar Oomer Jamal contributed largely towards the popularity of the institution by his generosity. Admissions and Results. - 487 cases in all were admitted, of these 169 (with 82 deaths) were returned as Plague cases, but it is more than probable that the number returned was in excess of the actual number. Diagnosis had, in many cases, to rest with the Hakim or Nurse and several cases (more particularly those returned as pneumonic) were most likely not Plague cases at all, though in some respects resembling them.

This hospital intended for Mohamedans only, was kept open during the period under report from the 1st of June 1900 to the 31st of January 1901 and maintained by the Municipality. Patients only received native treatment. The institution was closed on the 31st of January 1901 and the remaining patients removed to the Maratha Hospital (where special wards were set apart for them ) and permitted to have native treatment if they desired it. Accommodation, &c.-The accommodation and the disinfection, mortuary and conservancy arrangements remained the same as in previous years. Staff.-Hakim Rahiman remained in charge throughout the time the hospital was open, and was assisted by a staff consisting of 1 Compounder, 1 Clerk, 3 Ward Boys, 2 Ayahs, 1 Cook, 1 Office Peon, 1 Dhobi and 3 Bhangis. Admissions and Results.-The total number of admissions was 253. Of these, 92 were returned as Plague, with 49 deaths. It is very probable, however, that the number returned as Plague is in excess of the number of actual Plague cases, as they include 58 cases said to be Pneumonic Plague. Most of these were most likely only ordinary cases of Pneumonia, seeing that more than half recovered. The Hakim not being a qualified Medical man, and not able to make Bacteriolo- gical Examinations, was not in a position to determine exactly how many, if any, of them were plague cases, and so he classified them all as Plague.

Recovered No. Died. Recovered. XXXIII      12 (1st bleeding) 1 0 1 1 1 0 XXXIV      9 (2nd ") 7 5 2 7 6 1  Total      8 5 3 8 7 1 3. Thus out of the 8 Serum eases, 5 died and 3 recovered, whereas of the Control, 7 died and 1 recovered. 4. The former included 3 moribunds and the latter 4. 5. Tables giving the details of the cases treated with the Serum have  been appended to the report as usual. I have, &c., N. H. CHOKSEY, M.D., Special Assistant Health Officer. 58

?233 I have the honour to submit the following report on cases of plague treated with Professor Lustig's Curative Serum at the Arthur Road Hospital during July 1900 :- 1.    There were only 9 admissions during the month ; 4 were treated with the Serum alternately with an equal number by ordinary treatment. One case could not be diagnosed during life time. 2.    Of the former, 1 died and 3 recovered, whereas the latter had 3 deaths and 1 recovery only. 3.    The serum cases included one convalescent patient ; the controls had 2 moribunds. 4.

?234 I have the honour to submit the following report on cases of plague treated with Professor Lustig's Serum at the Arthur Road Hospital from August to December 1900 :- 1. The alternate system of treatment, which had been adopted since May 1899, in order to test the efficacy of the Serum on a statistical basis, was continued up to the end of July 1900. During this period 484 cases were treated with the serum alternately with an equal number treated by ordinary methods. The recovery rate of the serum cases was 32.03 per cent. as against 20.46 per cent. in the non-serum cases. The difference, therefore, in favour of the former was 11.57 per cent. which is equivalent to an increase in the recovery rate by 56 per cent., or to put it in another way, if out of a given number of plague patients 100 recover under ordinary treatment, the same number if treated with the serum would give 156 recoveries. 2. On the completion of the above observations instructions were issued by the Municipal Commissioner to abandon the alternate method and to use the serum in suitable cases only. But as the number of admissions was limited, during the period covered by the present report, it was not found feasible to select the cases, and during some months all the patients admitted were placed under the serum treatment. 3. There were 37 admissions only ; 26 of whom were treated with the serum, and 11 by ordinary methods ; of the former 19 died and 7 recovered, whereas there was not a single recovery in the latter. 4. The following table gives the particulars  for the period month by month :-    Total. Serum Cases. Non-Serum Cases. 1900. Admissions. No. Died. Recovered. No. Died.

?237 I have the honour to submit the following report on cases of plague treated with Professor Lustig's Serum at the Arthur Road Hospital during January 1901:- 1. Just about the end of last year a certain number of cases that were observed in this hospital, as well as outside, gave indications of a decided change for the worse in the virulence of plague, and as cases began to be admitted during the month, it became at once evident that we had to deal with a graver and more intensely virulent type of plague than hitherto. A systematic examination of the blood of all the cases undergoing the serum treatment was therefore begun, and microscopic as well as culture examina- tions showed that the cases were septicmic having begun in them much earlier and before the serum treatment was commenced. The cases resolved themselves into two types. In the one, there apparently existed a small single bubo, situated in the groin, neck or axilla, varying in size from a pea to a small marble which remained in much the same state during the life-time of the patient or even became smaller. The general symptoms were much more acute than in ordinary cases of the bubonic type, and high fever, rapidly failing pulse, intense and violent delirium, persistent vomiting of food and medicines, coffee-grounds vomiting, &c., &c., characterised it. Death usually supervened within 36 to 48 hours of the onset of initial symptoms. In the other type were found a triple set of buboes involving the femoral inguinal and superfinal and deep iliac glands varying in size from a pigeon's egg to a full size cricket ball and with or without extensive perigland or infiltration in the subcutaneous connective tissue. The general symptoms were just as grave as in the first type, and the patient succumbed within 3 to 4 days. In almost all these cases, blood examination showed septicmia, and examination after death revealed the fact that the intense gravity and virulence of these cases was due to blood septicmia coupled with a rapid extension of the infection to the deep glands of the pelvis, the ili and lumbar glands and other lymphatic glands along the blood vessels in the abdomen. It was also noticed that in many cases where only a single bubo was evident on the surface and yet an apparently mild case had proved fatal in spite of the serum treatment and that a large number of deep-seated buboes also existed which could not be felt during the life-time of the patient and the existence of which was not even suspected before death. It is not implied from the above that such cases did not exist in the previous epidemics. All that is contended here is that whereas in former epidemics they were fewer in number and were observed during the height of the epidemic only, they have appeared now in large numbers-in fact constitute the bulk of the admissions-and at the beginning of the present epidemic. And again fresh arrivals in the City seem to have been greatly susceptible to these virulent types. 2. It was under these circumstances that the serum treatment was resumed in January 1901, and in spite of its being of the same, if not somewhat greater potency than last year, not much impression could be made in septicmic cases. Much larger doses of the serum were injected subcutaneously without any appreciable results 60
238 and even intravenous injection had but a temporary effect.    So rapid was the multiplication of the plague bacilli in the blood that even to intravenous injections within eight hours could barely check their enormous growth. The blood stream in these cases became virtually a huge culture medium, propagating the bacilli indefinitely -a process in which no amount of serum could overtake the rapidity of their multiplication. And some idea of the nature of this blood infection can be formed when it is stated that from a single drop of blood as many as 300 colonies of plague bacilli were grown, each colony consisting of thousands of such germs. The number of such colonies varied in different cases from 3 or 4 to 300 in a single drop of blood. The serum-treated cases  having demonstrated the above facts, a systematic blood examination of all cases has been undertaken subsequently, and at the  date of writing  this report no change in the type of cases can be reported. In concluding this part of the report I must express my obligations to Drs. Mayr and Berestueff for their cordial co-operation and assistance not only in the examinations of the blood but also in making intravenous injections and other observations in the hospital wards. 3. The number of patients admitted during the month was 48. Lustig's serum was used in 21 cases. As we had a stock of Roux's serum (from the Pasteur Institute, Paris) it was considered advisable to treat a few cases with it in order to compare its efficacy with the former, and hence three cases were injected. Professor Gajjar's Liq. Iodi. Terchloride was applied in 4 cases. Of the rest, 4 patients were admitted in a convalescent or semi-convalescent condition and required no specific treatment and 16 were either moribund or semi-moribund in whom life was prolonged by cordial and other stimulants. 4. The following table shows in detail the results in these cases :-   Number Died. Recovered. Lustig's serum ......  ...  ....... Roux's serum     Professor Gajjar's Liq. lodi. Terchlor.     Convalescent and semi-convalescent  Moribund and semi-moribund 21 3 4 4 16 12 1 3 ... 16 9 2 1 4 ... Total   ...  48 32 16                   5. (a) Lustig's Serum.-Of the 21 cases treated with Lustig's serum, 12 died and 9 recovered. There were 9 septicmic cases amongst those that died, and only one case became septicmic during treatment amongst those that recovered, but he ultimately pulled through. There were thus only 3 deaths amongst the 12 non- septicmic cases treated with the serum. The average quantity of serum used in the cases that recovered was 400 c. c. and in those that succumbed 360 c. c. This average is nearly double that of last year and confirms what has been stated above as regards the virulence of plague during the present epidemic, and were it not for such large doses it would not have been possible to check their septicmia and to save those that recovered.
?239 (b) Roux's Serum.-Three cases were treated with Roux's serum, of whom 1 died and 2 recovered. None of them were septicmic, when injected and the former became septicmic only two or three days before death. This patient's life was prolonged for 13 days during the course of which he received 900 c. c. of Roux's serum and when the supply became exhausted, 600 c. c. of Lustig's. Examination after death revealed that it was only the enormous quantity (1,500 c. c.) of serum put in that prolonged his life from day to day, as he had multiple buboes in the groin, pelvis and abdomen, and multiple plague abscesses in these as well as in the liver and lungs. The two cases that recovered received 650 c. c. in one case and 430 c. c. plus 30 c. c. of Lustig's in the other. (c) Professor Gajjar's Liq. Iodi. Terchl.-This preparation was used in 4 cases only; it had to be suspended in one case as the patient could take nothing by the mouth, and out of the three that received full doses, 2 died and 1 recovered. 6. A table showing the details of the cases treated with the serum has been appended as usual:-

?252 Note on the Experiments with Professor Lustig's Serum in 1900-1901 by Dr. Polverini. Having satisfied themselves from the results of the alternate treat- ment with Prof. Lustig's serum during 1900, that there was no doubt about its curative properties, the Special Medical Officer, Plague Operations, Col. J. S. Wilkins, D. S. O., suggested, and the late Municipal Commissioner, Mr. Harvey, decided its preparation on a still larger scale, sanctioning the purchase of 15 more horses and the necessary apparatus, which latter had to be ordered from Europe. Unfortunately they did not arrive until 17th January 1901. So the immunisation could not be proceeded with as vigorously as it was desired and a good number of the new horses could not be taken in hand pro- perly before the date abovementioned. It was intended to immunise the horses over a longer period than hitherto in order to get a stronger serum, but the necessity of meeting the demand for the serum did not permit of the carrying out of this intention, as the serum derived from the old horses had to be used in 3 to 4 times larger closes than in the previous epidemic and got exhausted much quicker than expected. Al- ready in the months from August to December 1900, it was noticed at the Arthur Road Hospital, that the serum treatment did not give the expected reduction of the mortality although the experiments on animals showed a satisfactory increase in strength due to the prolonged immu- nisation of the old horses. The clinical observation and bacteriological examination soon revealed the cause of the lesser efficacy of the serum. The type of the cases of plague admitted to the hospital had undergone a considerable change, which but for the serum treatment might have escaped detection for a much longer time, the admissions being so few. The type was characterised by the preponderance of triple buboes, i. e., femoral, inguinal and iliacal buboes, the frequency of septicmia, 45% of the patients showing this almost absolutely fatal complication already on admission, and of relapses. The proportion of the patients with triple buboes to those with single buboes was reversed 2:1 instead of 1:2 as formerly. That alone could account for the less satisfactory results ob- tained with the serum which had never shown decided curative effects in patients with contiguous buboes. (Vide the report for the epidemic of 1899-1900, page 376.) It might be said that the increased doses should have compensated the multiplicity of the foci of infection. Against that it must be re- membered that the cures effected by a serum treatment and for the matter of that, by any kind of treatment, is only within certain limits, a mere question of quantity. This was experimentally proved for the virus of and serum against typhoid fever. Whereas 0001 cc. of typhoid fever serum was able to protect a guinea-pig against 0002 gr. of a living culture. 0003 cc. of the serum was unable to do so against 0006gr. of the culture.
?253 It is of interest to inquire into the reasons for  the change of the proportion of the types of plague as it was observed in hospitals. Although triple buboes were no doubt oftener met with, also in early cases it is hardly admissible to explain their preponderance in hospitals, by this fact alone claiming thus the distinction of a special type of plague for triple buboes. Triple buboes no doubt develop very often from single buboes and correspond to a more advanced stage of the disease. I am in- clined to believe that patients were generally brought later to the hospitals than in the previous years when hospital treatment was compulsory for plague. It is more than probable that under the new rules the patients were kept at home until they had got bad enough for being sent to the hospital, the infection having either spread to the neighbouring glands or become generalised. This would help to explain the change of the propor- tion of the types of plague admitted to the hospital which change affected also the number of convalescents who were fewer than in previous years. Also the number of patients with plague pneumonia and such dying few hours after admission were less no doubt, because patients in very bad condition were not exposed to the hardships of the transport. Therefore the disheartening uniform severity of the patients collecting in the hospitals in whom the serum treatment was commenced not with the confidence of recovery, as in previous years, but simply in order "to give the patient a chance." The serum was used at the Arthur Road Hospital, the Maratha Hospital and in private practice. From 1st of August until the 1st of February the patients were selected at the Arthur Road Hospital; out of 85 admissions 50 were treated with the serum. The total recovery rate was 27%. In February no serum was available. From 1st March until 31st of May the patients were treated alternately, 104 with and 102 without serum. The recovery rate was 22% and 20.5% respectively. The analysis of the cases shows that the recovery rate for single buboes was a good deal higher under the serum treatment and that the serum patients generally lived considerably longer than the others. It shows also that the serum side was at a disadvantage, as it had more patients with triple buboes and more cases of septicmia amongst the single buboes. If the serum treatment could have been continued during Febru- ary when the largest number of patients was admitted, these disadvantages would have most probably been compensated and a more substantial difference in favour of the serum been obtained. It has already been pointed out in the previous reports that the results of the alternate treatment are reliable only if a large number of cases is dealt with. It is therefore clear that the results obtained during this epidemic, although not satisfactory, can in no way shake the evidence obtained in the previous epidemic from a five times larger number of observations. 64
?254 At the Maratha Hospital the serum was used in selected patients from the 13th of November until 18th of January. In the beginning the selection was made by Dr. Mayr, later on by the Medical Officer of the hospital or his assistant who made also the injections except few intraven- ous ones. 65 patients were admitted during the period given above. 37 received the serum treatment and had 6 recoveries, 28 were excluded from it, some being under native treatment and had one recovery, a boy who did not receive the serum because it was considered he would recover without it. The number of recoveries under the serum treatment would have been 9 but for the fact that 3 patients died in full convalescence from avoidable complications. A woman died on the 30th day of illness from exhaustion due to crysipelas following the incision of the bubo; a girl on the 10th day from tetanus originating from the seat of the last injection; and a man on the 17th day of the collapse following an attack of cholera form diarrha. Others in which the serum had admittedly proved beneficial died from unavoidable complication, so a girl on the 13th day, mother objecting to the further treatment when improvement had set in. Three patients died from bronchitis, peritonitis and croupous pneumonia respectively on the 8th, 9th and 13th day of illness. Those not treated with the serum died all within 4 days after admission except two who lived 6 days. There was only one mild case amongst all admis- sions which recovered on the control side, and no convalescent case. The type of the disease was exceedingly severe, the total mortality amongst the 65 admissions being 89.5%. Triple buboes although usually put down as single on the charts of temperature, and septicmia were preponderant as at the Arthur Road Hospital. The severity of the disease  can further be judged by the fact that out of 30 cases admitted during January after the discontinuance of the serum treatment only 3 recovered, two of them being convalescent with buboes ready for opening, so that in fact, out of 28 acute cases only one recovered after a very prolonged illness. Probably even, the late Medical Officer of the Maratha Hospital with all his vast clinical experience of plague will hardly claim that he was able to select for the serum treatment all those who would have recovered by nature alone. And few, as the recoveries were, they were practically all on the serum side and give unmistakable evidence that the serum treatment was not a "complete failure" at the Maratha Hospital, in which it had to contend also against difficulties not originating in the disease, not the least of which was the selection of the patients by some body who had no experience of the serum treatment. The records received from the private practitioners show that 16 patients recovered amongst 38 treated. From this short resume it will be seen why the serum could not be prepared in the quantity intended and why the results did not correspond to those obtained previously. Still ample evidence of the efficacy of the serum was obtained in many instances even in the most advanced cases and much valuable information was gained by the preparation and the application of the serum. On the other hand it can not be denied that the experience of the last epidemic
255 indicates clearly that even large doses of a strong serum will have only very limited life-saving effects in the patients as they are admitted at present in our hospitals. In order to get the expected and possible benefit from the serum treatment, it will be necessary, apart from the perfection of the serum, to try to induce the patients to resort earlier to the hospital and to encourage the use of the serum in private practice. The first step for this purpose seems to convince the public that there is a reliable remedy against the disease if applied in proper time. Once such a conviction has taken root, there is no doubt that the patients will come to the hospital as soon as possible and that the serum will be used more extensively in private practice; but with the authorities themselves in part reluctant to acknowledge the results of the serum treatment, it will be very difficult to create that conviction.
