PREFACE. THE Secretary of State for India having required that the Statistics of the Native Armies and Jails of the Minor Presidencies shall be incorporated in the Annual Series of Tables appended to the Report of the Sanitary Com- missioner with the Government of India, the series for 1877 will include, in a uniform shape, the Statistics of the European. and Native Armies and the Jail Population of India. The introduction of this change makes it expedient to close with the returns of 1876 the series of annual compilations having reference to the Bengal Presidency only; and the volume containing the statistics of the six years from 1871 to 1876 is issued along with these commentaries. Since 1871, the Statistics of the European Army of the Three Presidencies have been placed in my hands, and the results have been published annually. The statistics of a series or years are required adequately to illustrate many questions of importance relating to the medical history of the British Soldier in India, and the First Section of this Report gives for the period the illustra- tions required to supplement the tables which have reference to sickness and mortality generally. The statistics of localities and the influence of seasonal changes I shall reserve for a future opportunity, when it may be possible to contrast the experi- ence of the ten years from 1871 to 1880 with that of the decennial period 1860-69, already framed and published as a standard of comparison. Reference to the Table of Contents will show the subjects which I propose to take up for consideration in the meantime. In the Second Section, relating to the Native Army of Bengal, the Statis- tics of the Ten Years from 1867 to 1876 are reviewed, and a Standard for the Ten Years, in a series of forty-nine tables, is appended. The Statistics of the Sta- tions of the Presidency for the period are printed. in detail for twelve stations only, which may be taken as representative of areas; but the same Statistics of locality have been made up in detail for each Cantonment of the Presidency, and are available for reference. The Third Section reviews the Jail Mortality of the Presidency over a period of Eighteen Years. The statistics are arranged in two series, having reference to the eighteen years from 1859 to 1876, and to the ten years from 1867 to 1876. The reason for this will appear when the contents of these tables are discussed. The latter series is drawn up as a Ten-year Standard, uniform with that for the Native Army of Bengal; but, by desire of the Secre- tary of State for India, the figures of the ten years have been adapted so as to represent the different Jail Administrations of the Presidency. The Ten-year standard consists of fifty-six tables; and this is, I believe, the first time that
iv PREFACE. the Statistics of the Prisoners of the Presidency have been brought together for a series of years, and reviewed on an adequate basis. The chapters on the forms which destructive disease assumes in jails, and on epidemic fevers, contagious and non-contagious, open up for study subjects of world-wide importance. The Fourth Section continues the history of Epidemic Cholera in Hindostan from 1873 to the close of 1876, taking up the narrative from the date at which my report of 1872 closed. It teaches how, when cholera has disappeared, its renewal over the different provinces of India may be expected to occur; and in the successive advances throughout 1875 and 1876, phenomena so striking in their character as to be appreciable by any educated observer, have come forward in every month, and from one end of India to the other, to demonstrate that the distribution of cholera is brought about by the same natural agencies which have been in operation through the past sixty years.

The results for the five years 1867-71 were summarised in the Annual Report of the Sanitary Commissioner for 1871, pages 49-52, and as they seemed consistent, it was deemed unnecessary to continue the enquiry. The general statistics of the Three Presidencies contrasted on the re- sults of the period 1871-76. In the two tables which conclude this chapter, the results for the Army of India are aggre- gated and the ratios shown year by year, as well as for the period; and the results of the period for the Armies of the Three Presi- dencies are placed side by side, to contrast the ratios of disease and death as these are manifested in Northern, Western and Southern India. With the highest death-rate and daily sick-rate, Madras gives the lowest admission-rate. The meaning of this is, that in the climate of Southern India, while dysentery and hepatitis come forward in an excessive ratio, the climatic fevers of Northern and Western India compara- tively disappear; and, indeed, to show to the full the contrast of the fever ratio it is necessary to exclude the statistics of Kamptee, which, as regards liability to fever, is associated naturally and geographically with Bengal and Bombay, and not with Madras. The ratio for enteric fever is as high in Madras as in Bengal or Bombay; and it is not in the cases of fevers returned as "continued" or "remittent" that the contrast is chiefly marked, although for such fevers Bengal shows an admission-rate of 175 per 1,000 as con- trasted with a ratio of 111 for Madras. In the years 1871-76, Kamptee gave more than the half of the admissions of the Madras Presidency attributed to intermittent fevers14 STATISTICS OF THE BRITISH ARMY IN INDIA FROM 1871 TO 1876. [Section I. Composition of 100 deaths in the Armies of the Three Presidencies. It necessarily follows that the liability to death from hepatitis and dysentery is doubled in Madras, while the chances of death from fevers other than enteric are small, compared to what they are in the other presi- dencies. This is the comparative expectation, reckoning liability at 100Chapter I.] GENERAL STATISTICS OF THE ARMY FOR THE SIX YEARS. 15 The characteristic distinction is maintained in the Invaliding of Madras; out of each 100 cases invalided, 32 were attributed to dysentery or liver affection, against 20 in Bengal and 18 in Bombay. On the average of the six years 1871-76, 100 cases of invaliding from the Three Presidencies were constituted thus:16 STATISTICS OF THE BRITISH ARMY IN INDIA FROM 1871 TO 1876. [Section I.

[Section I. The invaliding ratios of young, mature and old soldiers and their details compared. I have shown that 34 is the age up to which a large proportion of the Army continues efficient for service in India. On the average of the last six years, I find no increase on the invaliding ratio in the five- year age period 30 to 34, as compared with the five years 25 to 29. The ratio is 36 per 1,000 at the former and 38 per 1,000 at the younger age; nor do the details differ in any essential particular. In the tables which follow, I have therefore made the distinction in three age periods, namely, below 25, from 25 to 34, and 35 upwards, representing approximately the young, mature and old soldiers as far as invaliding is concerned. I have reckoned in relation to length of service the soldier as young in the first four years, mature in the three years succeeding, and old after seven years residence in India. The approximate accuracy of this arrangement as regards both age and length of service, is strikingly demonstrated by comparing together the details of these two statements, which show how 100 cases of invaliding are made up at the different ages, and at three periods of residence in India. Composition of 100 cases of Invaliding among young soldiers, mature soldiers and old soldiers.

In 1876 there were but 1,185 lads under 20 in the Army of India. In former years, for purposes of comparison, we reckoned lads under 20 as a class, but it is evidently inexpedient to give this small body the same position when diminished to its present minimum. Taking all under 25 as a class, and retaining the sub-divisions adopted in former reports, the ratios in which the British soldier died in relation to Age in the six years from 1871 to 1876, were as under:40 STATISTICS OF THE BRITISH ARMY IN INDIA FROM 1871 TO 1876.

The facts contained in the preceding Chapter demonstrate the truth that a very large number of men break down in the early years of their Indian service. In several of my pre- vious reports, I have tried to show how important it is that the fact should be apprehended, and that regiments new to India should be specially cared for and placed, as far as the contingen- cies of the service will admit, in a position where they are likely to encounter the climatic influences, inseparably connected with residence in India, under the most advantageous conditions.

Making, allowance for the peculiarities of certain years, we may assume that climatic agencies will not materially differ in their effects in different years, as regards bodies of the same constitution stationed in the same locality. It is therefore important to keep up a local record to serve as an index of the localities which experience has shown to be adapted for, or unsuited to, the requirements of newly-arrived troops. Umballa, and Bareilly are the two stations of Bengal which appear to most advantage in the following statement. Umballa owes its small death-rate in some measure to the removal to the hills of the young men of new regiments; its proximity to the hill stations affords the opportunity, and the withdrawal of a large number of lads during the hot months is generally considered expedient. Hazaribagh, Lucknow, Fyzabad, and Agra have afforded the highest death-rates of the period; but even in the best stations, it is rare to find a new regiment showing a death-rate below 17 per 1,000. In the Bombay and Madras Presidencies, Poona, Bellary, and Bangalore show lower death- rates than any station of Bengal, excepting Umballa in 1877.

We expect to find in the statistics of the same body of men after 12 months' residence in India, a considerable decrease in the diseases which show themselves in an exaggerated form in the first hot season. These are the severer class of fevers, heat apoplexy and bowel complaints; and the death-rates for these diseases may be expected to show a corresponding diminution. This expectation is borne out in the figures which follow. Among the admission-rates, enteric fever goes down from 13 in the first year to 5 in the second; remittent and continued fevers from 315 to 150; heat apoplexy from 5 to 1·7; and bowel complaints from 156 to 112. Excluding cholera and violent deaths, the death-rate per 1,000 diminishes from 19.34 to 11.55,56 STATISTICS OF THE BRITISH ARMY IN INDIA FROM 1871 TO 1876.

[Section I. Demonstration of the truth of the assertion made in previous reports that Enteric Fever is the one disease peculiar to the young soldier in- dia. In previous reports I have made the very plain statement, that this Enteric Fever is the one disease above all others from which the young soldier dies. I can give no better answer to those who have thought fit on theoretical grounds to deny the correctness of my assertion, than to produce here the figures for the period 1871-76, which thoroughly bear out my deduction:Chapter III.] MEDICAL HISTORY OF REGIMENTS AT DIFFERENT PERIODS OF SERVICE. 61 Under 20, 48 per cent. of all deaths are shown to have been due to it, and 41 per cent. of all deaths at the age of 21; it contributed one-third of all deaths at the age of 22, and more than a fourth of the total at the ages of 23 and 24. In the six years, taking all deaths below 25, the lowest percentage contributed by Enteric Fever deaths to the total was 28; in 1876, it was 45; in 1873, 39; in 1874, 34; in 1871, 33; and in 1872, 30. These figures give no exaggerated picture; on the contrary, we know that the fact is under- rated in this statement. Under the heads Remittent and Continued Fevers, Apoplexy, Menin- gitis, Pneumonia, Peritonitis and Enteritis many deaths appear, which would have appeared as Enteric Fever had the diagnosis been more accurate. Its nature and natural alliances may be inferred from the various phases in which I have exhibited the statistics, as related to age, to acclimatisation, to season, and to locality. In a physiological aspect, the infarction which appears to determine the character and duration of the fever is one and the same phenomenon, under whatever circumstances the fever may occur. The cause of the infarction need not necessarily be one and the same. I am prepared to find in India manifestations of the fever susceptible of different explanations as to their origin; and the exclusive views now popular in England are not such as commend themselves to the Indian observer; who, while admitting that the observation of home authorities may be correct, does not feel himself bound down to the limits which seem to have been prescribed, and is compelled to conclude that, when so restricted, the mark is overshot and many eases of Enteric Fever represented as attributable to purely local causes on insufficient grounds. To complete the table showing the causes of death in the young and unacclimatised, I append the details of the deaths entered above under the head "All other Diseases." Deaths under 25, entered above under the heading "All other Diseases."

Numbers required to make good the Loss in Five Years by death and invaliding. To make good the loss by death and invaliding, I showed in a former report that in five years after landing in India, recruits equal to 36 per cent. of the original strength had been required to maintain the body of 13,000 men whose statistics were available. Out of a strength maintained approximately at 13,361, 1,923 died and 2,822 were invalided in five years of Indian Service. Thirteen regiments which came to India in 1869, 1870, 1871 and 1872 maintained during the first five years a strength of 11,507. They lost in all 3,086 men, 963 by death and 2,123 by invaliding. Recruits, equal in number to 27 per cent., were required to keep up these regiments at the full strength. The proportion of deaths to invaliding was in the first period 15 to 21; out of the 36 lost, 15 died and 21 were invalided. In the second period, out of a loss of 26.9, 8.4 were deaths and 18.5 were men invalided. The great diminution in the number of deaths from cholera is one of the chief causes of the improvement in the death-ratio which characterises the statistics of the later years. Loss varies much with circum Stances and locality. Illustration. Taking the regiments individually, the loss fluctuates greatly. It is determined at one time to a minimum by favourable location and a succession of healthy years; and at another to a maximum., by the prevalence of epi- demic influences, or by the occupation of a bad station, or by both combined, as very frequently happens. I need not show the details year by year for these regiments. The tables which follow, giving the ratios of mortality throughout the course of their Indian service for regiments which have served out their time, sufficiently illustrate this point. Aggregating the statistics of the five years, these are the results. The loss varies from 13 to upwards of 30, the good influences of Poona and Ferozepore helping chiefly to deter- mine the smaller ratio, and the evil influences of Cawnpore, Lucknow, and Peshawar the latter.

LOSS IN THE COURSE OF A TOUR OF INDIAN SERVICE AMONG THE MEN WHO LANDED WITH THEIR REGIMENTS. The number lost by death and in- validing among the men who landed in India with their Regiments, illustrated by 42 examples. Such is the loss which Regiments maintained at an efficient strength experience. If Regiments were not recruited, and if the men who came from England diminished in number year by year by death and invaliding, the proportion of the original body likely to be removed during the tour of Indian service is indicated in this
Chapter III.] MEDICAL HISTORY OF REGIMENTS AT DIFFERENT PERIODS OF SERVICE. 65 statement, which gives the experience of 42 Regiments whose tour of Indian service extended over a period of from 8 to 14 years. For Regiments over 10 years' service, the loss shown is 48 per cent., which seems a normal average. In some of the old Indian Regiments the loss shown is much in excess of this; the increased ratio is probably owing to all the men present, and who had already served for a longer or shorter period when these Regiments were reorganized, being reckoned as the original soldiers of the Regiment, many of whom were in the natural course of events early removed.

SECTION II. TEN-YEAR STANDARD FOR THE NATIVE ARMY OF THE BENGAL PRESIDENCY, BASED ON THE STATISTICS OF THE YEARS FROM 1867 TO 1876. The statistics of the European and Native Armies compared, as related to season. In contrasting the mortality of the European and Native Armies, the first point that strikes the observer is, that the relation of mortality to season is reversed in the case of these two bodies. Climatic influences predominate in the case of the European in the hot and rainy months; but with the setting in of the cold season mortality declines steadily, and rises again only with the heat of April. With the Native soldier this does not hold. The mortality, which is high in October, increases during November, December and January, and the effects of cold on the debilitated constitution tell even in February and March. In the previous section, I have called attention to the decrease of mortality in the last quarter of the year in the case of the European Army, as indicative of a great change for the better in all the arrangements affecting the health of British troops, and instanced the steady progress throughout the months from October onwards, as the chief contrasting feature between the statistics of recent and former periods of observation. The case is very different with the Native soldier. Climatic influences, from which the European readily recovers, leave lasting effects on his weakly frame; and while the European. regains health and energy in the cold months, the Native under exposure develops fatal disease. In former years, at the close of bad epidemic seasons, the mortality among the Europeans prostrated and beyond the power of healthy reaction, was in many instances excessive. In 1869, universally an epidemic year, the tendency to death from the long continuance of severe sickness was in several cases developed. As an example, Her Majesty's 58th Regiment, stationed at Allahabad, lost 20 men from dysentery and hepatitis in the last months of the year. But such a case as this, which is not to be compared with the great outbreaks of for- mer years, is in these times to be quoted as rare and exceptional. The parallel phenomenon which, in former years, so gravely affected the statistics of our hill stations, has also been noticed in reviewing the statistics of the European Army. Some time since, having occasion to contrast the statistics of the Native Army of Bengal for the ten-year period 1864 to 1873 with the standard for the European Army of 1860 to 1869, I was much struck with the illustration of the point in question afforded by the general ratios of the two armies. The relation of the mortality to months in the European and Native Armies stands thus:82 TEN-YEAR STANDARD FOR THE NATIVE ARMY OF BENGAL, 1867 TO 1876. [Section II. April; and 80 per cent. of all deaths from respiratory diseases are shown in the same months. The fact that nearly 200 men have died on the march in the cold season within the last ten years from fever or pneumonia, in the great majority of cases synonymous terms, demonstrates how exposure tells on the debilitated sepoy, and indicates the necessity for avoiding night marching in every case where a regiment has suffered severely in the previous months. In the Frontier Force 80 per cent. of all deaths from respiratory diseases are included within these months, and 63 per cent. of all deaths from fevers. "These are the figures on which the preceding remarks are based:- Died per cent. of the total in each month from the chief causes of mortality affecting the Native Army-Results of 1864-73.

"The difference in the character of the fevers of the Native and the European is shown by this, that in the months from May to October 70 per cent. of all fever deaths occur in the European Army, and 30 per cent. from November to April; while in the Native army, 60 per cent. occur in the cold months, and 40 in the six hot months of the year. Respiratory disease represents 20 per cent. of the mortality of the Native, and 5 per cent of that of the European. But, on the other hand, hepatitis, which causes 1.59 per cent. of the Native mortality, brings about 17 out of every hundred deaths of Europeans; heat apoplexy is shown with a ratio of 11.51, as compared with 1.88 in the case of the Native; and heart disease is responsible for 5.27 per cent. of the deaths of European soldiers, and for less than 2 per cent. of the total Native mortality." In the ten years ending 1876, after excluding cholera, 64 per cent. of the total mortality of the Native Army took place between November and April, and 36 per cent. between May and October. In the European Army of Bengal, for the same ten-year period, 60 per cent. of the total mortality occurred from May to October, and 40 per cent. from November to April. Components of the Death-rates of the Native and European Armies of 1867-76 compared. The components of the death-rate were very nearly the same as represented above. Fevers, dysentery and the allied diseases, and respiratory diseases made up 77 per cent. of the total; and the remaining 23 per cent. was nearly identical in its composition.

Section II.] GENERAL DEDUCTIONS FROM THE STATISTICS OF THE PERIOD. 83 In the European Army the ratio for dysentery is much diminished, and that for heart disease increased in the later of the two periods above shown. In other respects there is little alteration, and the two statements may fairly be used to indicate the features in which the death-rates of the European and Native soldier diverge. Etiological distinction between the fevers of the European and Native Armies. By the coincidence of the number of fever deaths being nearly the same in both armies for the ten years 186784 TEN-YEAR STANDARD FOR THE NATIVE ARMY OF BENGAL, 1867 TO 1876. [Section II.

The decay of Native regiments in Eastern Bengal illustrated. The pneumonia of Northern India takes the place of the dysentery of Eastern Bengal. The death-rate per 1,000 of 1867-1876 for the two classes of disease combined is in Bengal Proper 5.57, and in the Punjab 5.67. But in the north the ratio for respiratory disease is 3.94, while in the east it is 1.77; and 3.80 die of bowel com- plaints in Bengal, against 1.73 who die from these affections in the Punjab. This is another very perfect illustration, showing how the human system sympathises with the special climatic conditions afforded to it. It must not be inferred from this that pneumonia is rare in Lower Bengal. The tendency for the lungs to fill up is always present when the system is anæmic; and in the cold weather pneumonia is always apt to be developed, although less frequently in Bengal than in Northern India. How a Native Army employed in an unhealthy climate may melt away was shown in the Bhootan campaign of 1865. Our Table II of 1865 gives the statistics month by month of the Native regiments which served with the Bhootan force. The force was 7,000 strong in March 1865, and before October, upwards of 2,000 men had been removed by death, or had been sent to their homes. In the field, 520 men died; and in the year following, 169 deaths were noted among the men sent sick to their homes. The whole force passed through the hospital nearly four times, and the number daily sick from May to October was never less than one-fifth of the total strength. What happened to nearly all may be illustrated by the loss in a single regiment of the force. In the two years 1865 and 1866, the 12th Native Infantry lost 105 men by death, 101 by invaliding, and 96 by taking their discharge or by being recommended for discharge by the medical officer. The total loss was 302, or nearly one-half of the strength of the corps; and yet the men were well rationed and well cared for in every respect. The following are examples of the loss by death and invaliding during a tour of service in Lower and Eastern Bengal. The 10th Native Infantry stationed in Lower Bengal from 1872 to 1876, and averaging 677 strong, lost in the five years 375 men, of whom 205 were discharged invalided, and 170 died. The loss was equal to 554 per 1,000, of which 303 was due to invaliding and 251 to deaths. As a contrast, in the same five-year period, the 16th Native Infantry, also stationed. in Lower and Eastern Bengal, lost in all 180 men out of an average strength of 716,86 TEN-YEAR STANDARD FOR THE NATIVE ARMY OF BENGAL, 1867 TO 1876.

It need not be inferred that the original disease affecting these men was the pneumonic typhus which we know as a specific disease; but to many who have considered the subject, it has occurred to suggest, that the asthenic pneumonia generated in such a case as this, and under such circumstances, may become contagious, and may be propagated from man to man as a contagious disease which falls by preference on the lungs.* Deaths from Fever and Pneumonia.

While it is possible that pneumonia of an asthenic type may become contagious, the parallel development of pneumonia over the entire Northern Punjab, and among Europeans although in a minor degree, points to the effects of a general influence. The epidemic fever of the later months of 1869, shown as under among our types over this area, left in every case persistent evil effects behind it, which were continued into the cold season, when chest diseases naturally prevail:88 TEN-YEAR STANDARD FOR THE NATIVE ARMY OF BENGAL, 1867 TO 1876. [Section II. In the ratio for cholera and violent deaths, the excess against the European is at least 4 per 1,000; and if this be considered, the ratios for climatic disease will be found to approximate very nearly, although differing in their details, as above shown.

[Section II. at length or in summary. With the publication of the tenth volume of the series at the close of 1877, an opportunity will occur for reviewing on a basis of ten years' ex- perience all matters relating to the medical history of the Native Army. Fluctuation in Strength of the Native Army in the ten years. The chief causes of fluctuation. For each station of the Presidency for the ten years, 1867-1876, the statistics of the Native Army have been arranged in a form similar to that in which the statistics of the British Troops are set forth for the ten years from 1860 to 1869. I have, however, considered it unnecessary to print these tables as a whole, and I have selected twelve typical examples for detailed illustration, and printed in summary only, the ten years' ratios for the principal stations. The examples given may be compared with the results for the provincial areas; and where the summarised ratios correspond closely with the stational or provincial type, it may be concluded that the items, of which they are the product, are not very dissimilar. In conclusion, I may observe that a very large number of men are annually removed from the rolls of the Native Army for reasons which have no relation to the health of the soldier. The Native Army of Bengal is a body in which great fluctuations occur. In these ten years, a strength equivalent to that of the whole army has disappeared, 58,000 men of the Regular Army and of the Punjab Frontier Force having in this time been removed from the rolls of their regiments. In the accompanying statement, Transfers account for 808 removals, Deaths for 10,047, and Invaliding for 15,271; while for non-medical reasons 31,839 men were sent away or took their discharge,Secion II.] GENERAL DEDUCTIONS FROM THE STATISTICS OF THE PERIOD. 91 Gain and Loss in Strength of the Native Army of the Bengal Presidency during the Ten Years from 1867 to 1876. 1867. 1868. 1869. 1870. 1871. 1872. 1873. 1874. 1875. 1876. 186792 TEN-YEAR STANDARD FOR THE NATIVE ARMY OF BENGAL, 1867 TO 1876.

THE GENERAL STATISTICS OF THE JAIL POPULATION OF THE BENGAL PRESIDENCY FROM 1859 TO 1876. In this report the statistics of the various Provinces are arranged ac- cording to Administrations. The statistics of the Jails of Bengal, published annually and appended to the report of the Sanitary Commissioner, are assimilated as regards geographical distribution to the provincial areas into which it has been found convenient to sub-divide the Bengal Presidency when illustrating the effects of locality in the case of the European and Native Armies. The Secretary of State for India has suggested that it might be convenient that our com- pilations should exhibit also the statistics of the jail population as related to Provincial Admi- nistration; and I have taken this opportunity of re-arranging the results of Administrations in a general manner for the period of 18 years, and for a ten-year period ending with 1876 in a form parallel with that given for the Native Army in the preceding section, and for the Euro- pean Army of Bengal in the Statistical Standard of 1860154 STATISTICS OF THE JAIL POPULATION OF BENGAL FROM 1859 TO 1876 [Section III. certain principles in connection with its history, it is because I know that the very same objec- tions and doubts will certainly be brought up again, and lead to not less disastrous consequences than have followed the assertion of erroneous individual opinions in our time. Taken province by province the improvement in the health of the prisoners is consistently observed. It is not only in the statistics of the prison population as a body that the improvement is evident. Taken province by province the history is consistent. In Bengal Proper, which has no typhus, the diminution of the ratio in the two nine-year periods, is from 90 to 70; in Oudh, from 83 to 22; in the North-Western Provinces from 72 to 36; in the Central Provinces from 64 to 39; and in the Punjab from 46 to 33. Both in epidemic disease and in the diseases of debility which charac- terise the death-rates of prisoners progress is evident and satisfactory. It is in the ratio for cholera, fever, and dysentery that the diminution is most apparent.

These areas are in some instances made up of sub-divisions which can be recognised as natural; and the statistics of these I have thought it worth while to show separ- ately. Again, some jails are healthy, and others are unhealthy; some are typical, and some have special characteristics which necessitate special illustration. On this account, I have selected for permanent record a few jails whose statistics teach something which it is important to recognise, and every one of these cases will be found of sufficient interest to justify the selection. The standard is made up of a series of fifty-six tables, and the general scheme may be comprehended by a perusal of the Table of Contents prefixed. Distribution of jail mortality by months. Special diseases as related to the monthly mortality. The phenomenon so strikingly illustrated in the case of the Native Army is here repeated; the prison population remains healthy up to August, and be- tween August and January 65 per cent. of the total mortality occurs. October, November and December tell upon the health of those who are old, or debilitated by the influences of the monsoon season; and it is the effect of cold which immediately determines the high death- rates of these months. In August, fevers, dysentery and diseases of anæmia begin to prevail; and towards the and of October, pneumonia comes in to carry on to a fatal termination what has been in progress during the three unhealthy months preceding. This is shown in the statistics of the ten years by these proportionate ratios:Chapter I.] GENERAL STATISTICS OF THE EIGHTEEN YEARS FROM 1859 TO 1876. 161 Bengal Proper. Oudh. N.-W. Provinces. Central Provinces. Punjab. Dysentery and Diarrh162 STATISTICS OF THE JAIL POPULATION OF BENGAL FROM 1859 TO 1876. [Section III July, and 59 between August and January. This disparity is related to the special climatic conditions in regard to which Lower Bengal differs from the provinces of Upper India. The parallel manifestation by months of dysentery and respiratory diseases and fevers, illustrated from the deaths of the jails of the Pun- jab. It is not necessary that the results of the general climatic influences which prevail during the rains and cold season should be manifested at Meerut as dysentery and at Lahore as pneumonia. Taking the Punjab as a province and the entire of the deaths of the ten years, the parallel rise and fall of all diseases of debility is typically shown. Some would call this general influence malaria and speak of these diseases as malarious. I note them now simply as following on the agencies normal to these months in Northern India: Died in the Jails of the Punjab, 1867Chapter I.] GENERAL STATISTICS OF THE EIGHTEEN YEARS FROM 1859 TO 1876. 163 of other outbreaks which probably were not etiologically related to the same epidemic, will be studied in the third chapter of this section. Fluctuation of mortality in the Great Jails of Upper India. The significance of the concluding table, and its importance as an index. I have placed here a general statement to show how mor- tality may fluctuate in the Great Jails of Upper India. Such a statement shows how much can be done to prevent prisoners from dying; and it stands as a warning, telling us how life may be sacrificed. Hence the necessity for comprehending clearly how and why prisoners die, and how destructive disease invades or originates in a prison community. This table teaches that large bodies of men may be kept together for years in a perfect state of health, the death-rates falling to a wonderful minimum. But between these very ratios are too often interposed others, which record disasters in which 10, 20 or 30 per cent. of the prison population has been swept away. At one time it is cholera that causes these terrible results, although of late years this cause of mortality has greatly diminished. At another time it is contagious fever; erysipelas, sloughing ulcers, contagious sore-throat, and pneumonic typhus come forward in single jails or in a group of jails by the interchange of prisoners; and evil endemic causes may bring about effects almost as bad, in the shape of asthenic dysen- tery and general cachexy. We may congratulate ourselves on general improvement in the health of the prisoners. But it is useless to ignore the fact that, in former years, in many individual jails an excel- lent sanitary condition was maintained for a long series of years164 STATISTICS OF THE JAIL POPULATION OF BENGAL FROM 1859 TO 1876.

CHAPTER II. THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS IN WHICH DESTRUCTIVE DISEASE IN JAILS SHOWS ITSELF. No record of contagious fevers in the jails of Bengal Proper. This is evident from the fever statistics. In the jails of Bengal Proper typhus is unknown, as far as is shown in the history of these 15 years. In the spring of 1860, when gangs were removed from the jails of the Upper Provinces where this fever was in progress, for transportation to the Andamans, the disease was introduced into the Alipore jail, and 28 deaths resulted. Beyond this there is no record of typhus in the province. Looking at the statistics of fever-deaths the fact is apparent. Out of a body steadily averaging from 18,000 to 19,000, the largest number of fever-deaths in any year has been 99; the minimum has been 54, and the average 77, taken over the period of 18 years. Out of 23,394 deaths, 1,379 only were attributed to fever. Taking the figures over all these years, I find, with the exception above noticed, that one jail only has ever shown above 10 fever-deaths in any annual return; and this showed 12. On five occasions, 10 deaths from fever have been returned; but the general fever mortality is made up of units from every jail of the Province. The limited fluctuation in the number of deaths from fever in Bengal Proper is shown by these actuals; the maximum of 99 deaths in 1860 includes the 28 deaths in Alipore jail due to the importation of contagious fever.

The Benares Central Jail as a typical example. I have chosen the Benares Jail (Table XXXIII), as typical for the jails of the Gangetic Provinces. This jail has reduced its death-rate from 76 to 30. The proportion which the different causes of mortality bore to the total in the two periods is shown below: Dysentery and DiarrhChapter II.] ASPECTS IN WHICH THE DESTRUCTIVE DISEASES OF JAILS APPEAR. 169 Exceptional mortality: epidemic of the Benares jails of 1855. Its nature and natural alliances. I have selected the Benares jail for another reason. In the three months170 STATISTICS OF THE JAIL POPULATION OF BENGAL FROM 1859 TO 1876. [Section III. 47 years there have been many sickly seasons in Benares, and if this record of sickness is applicable to one year only of this long period, then a special agency in promoting the epidemic must be looked for. The special agency was the contagion conveyed from man to man; a contagion developed in the prison community from the causes assigned, and when originated, propagating itself in the forms observed. The alliance of such a disease is not with typhus; and it occurred at a season when typhus is in abeyance. It is related in its nature to hospital gangrene; and like hospital gangrene it spreads by association. While this contagious cachexy was not a typhus, the same train of symp- toms may be manifested in connec- tion with a contagious fever allied to typhus. Contagious fever of 1855 on the North-Western Frontier. On the North-Western Frontier, and in no way epidemically related to the sickness of these jails, an outbreak in many respects similar was going on simultaneously. The Civil Surgeon of Dera Ghazee Khan sums up the effects in a single sentence: "The type has always been low, no matter what may have been the class of the disease; and certain forms of disease recognisable by the pro- fessional mind as peculiarly typical of a low and depressed state of the constitutional powers, have more than usually prevailed. These diseases are ulceration and sloughing of the cornea, night blindness, amaurosis from debility, latent pneumonia, and unhealthy inflammation and ulceration of the cellular tissue." This jail had 176 cases of fever and 32 deaths. All but 13 of the fever cases were of a low typhoid type. In Dera Ismail Khan Jail 34 cases proved fatal out of 165 admitted; and the Civil Surgeon and four Native Doctors passed through the fever, which was virulently contagious. I place these cases of the Gangetic Valley and Punjab Frontier together, to show the association of contagious fever with the same train of general symptoms. But I do not adduce the latter example as implying that the contagious fever was set up purely as a consequence of pre-existing conditions. The question involved will be taken up further on. Jail at Lucknow shown in two aspects, as one of the most unhealthy, and subsequently one of the most healthy, jails of India. Contagious fevers of 1860 and 1866. For Oudh I have selected the Lucknow Central Jail as typical (Table XXXIX). It is a most interesting illustration, showing what may be accomplished in keeping large bodies of prisoners free from fatal disease. The highest death-rate reached in the last 10 years has been 35, the lowest 8 per 1,000, and the average 21. In the 8 years, from 1859 to 1866 the minimum death-rate was 102, the highest 357, and the average 155. Twice this jail has localised contagious fever. It suffered along with many others of the jails of the North-West in 1860; and again the fever appeared towards the end of 1865. The parallelism in season and development between these two outbreaks was striking:Chapter II.] ASPECTS IN WHICH THE DESTRUCTIVE DISEASES OF JAILS APPEAR. 171 Mortality in the Lucknow Jail, 1859172 STATISTICS OF THE JAIL POPULATION OF BENGAL FROM 1859 TO 1876.

The general unhealthy conditions have been common to Meerut and the adjoining districts of the North-Western Provinces in these years. Within the jail the state of matters is thus described:174 STATISTICS OF THE JAIL POPULATION OF BENGAL FROM 1859 TO 1876. [Section III. typhus was re-introduced from the jails of the North-Western Provinces; and although this last was limited to the eastern circle of jails, the jail mortality for the province rose to 82. From 1861 onwards to the present, perhaps not a single year has passed without the appear- ance of contagious fever in some shape. In the first years many jails suffered in common; but of late, two or three jails only have brought forward contagious disease in each year. The alliance of certain respir- atory diseases with erysipelas and diphtheria: Lahore Central Jail 1873-74. I shall contrast the respiratory diseases of the Lahore Central Jail, dividing the 6 years 1869-74 into two periods. The object is to show the associa- tion of contagious disease occurring simultaneously with the increase in mortality observed in the two last years. In Oc- tober and November 1873 erysipelas and diphtheria appeared; 106 cases, and 10 deaths occurred from erysipelas before the disease ceased in July 1874, and 154 cases and 22 deaths from diphtheria took place in the same months. Now, these very same diseases we find frequently associated with the prevalence of contagious fevers and typhoid pneumonia, either in jails or epidemic among the free popula- tion; and the simultaneous appearance and general association suggests the extreme probability that in some jail outbreaks the pneumonic disease which has so enormously increased of late is a manifestation of a contagion introduced from without. In some instances I find that pneumonia and diphtheria were present in the same case; and in one case I observe that fatal erysipelas supervened on diphtheria. Nearly all these cases of diphtheria proved fatal within two days. The post mortem condition was the same in all, showing the throat and upper part of the larynx and trachea covered with a jelly-like white or ash-coloured exudation, while the lungs were in most cases free from actual disease.

The relation of these contagious fevers to season is defined by the figures given below:178 STATISTICS OF THE JAIL POPULATION OF BENGAL FROM 1859 TO 1871. [Section III. comes again into activity with the cold weather. This fever finally culminates in February 1871, and is at an end in May. These three outbreaks I regard as hanging together, the chain of contagious diseases being linked on over a period of two years and a half. From June 1871 to January 1873, no contagious disease appears in the Rawalpindi Jail; in 1872, 14 prisoners in all died out of an average of 1,025 prisoners. In January 1873, 2 prisoners die from erysipelas. A fever described as pure typhus succeeds, cutting off 42 prisoners, and dying as usual in June. When the typhus season comes round, in the fourth quarter of 1873, the prisoners begin again to die from contagious fever. But the type of fever is changed; and with it come fatal erysipelas and sore-throat. The contagious fever, erysipelas, fatal jaundice and sore-throat continue till June 1874; and the second series of outbreaks, spread over 18 months, ends. The simultaneous affection of the Peshawar and other jails points to the probability of renewed introduction of contagious disease from without, probably towards the end of 1872. The lesson taught by this history is, that the dying down of an outbreak of contagious disease in June, is not to be regarded as necessarily denoting its extinction; and all clothing or covering used during a spring outbreak should be destroyed, or, if returned into store, thorough- ly disinfected; and the former is to be recommended, as more certain to ensure immunity to the prisoners from contagious disease in the next cold season. The typhus of Northern India is not necessarily a relapsing fever; nor is scurvy among the general popula- tion essential for its development. I have already remarked on the coincidence of contagious fever with other low forms of disease on the Punjab Frontier in the spring of 1855.*This seems to have been a continued, and not a relapsing contagious fever. Regarding this fever at Bunnoo, the Civil Surgeon expressly remarks, that relapses were not observed. The Dera Ismail Jail lost 24 per cent. of its strength, and the Bunnoo Jail, 30 per cent. The Inspector of Jails says that on his visit to the Frontier he found scurvy very preva- lent in some of the towns and large villages, which the natives attributed to the want of rain. Several medical officers have been of opinion that scurvy could be detected in all cases where contagious fevers have broken out. But this conclusion is erroneous. Scurvy is certainly premonitary of typhus, and no condition affords so suitable a nidus for the operation of the typhus poison. We may go even further, and say that a scorbutic community with overcrowd- ing and bad ventilation, will readily develop contagious typhus.Chapter III.] EPIDEMIC FEVERS OF INDIA AND THEIR RELATION TO JAIL MORTALITY. 179 CHAPTER III. EPIDEMIC FEVERS IN RELATION TO JAIL MORTALITY. Epidemic fevers180 STATISTICS OF THE JAIL POPULATION OF BENGAL FROM 1859 TO 1876. [Section III. cholera. Its manifestations are, however, less definitely marked; and hence the difficulty of appreciating the natural history of the malaria miasm, as read in its manifestations, is far greater than in the ease of cholera, since the fact of the presence of cholera can never be misapprehended. Primarily, malarious epidemic fever is not contagious, and mistakes may arise by assuming the contrary. Many of the most deadly epidemics of India have been caused by fevers purely mala- rious. When the deadly remittent type of this fever is general over an area, the inexperienced constantly ask, whether so viru- lent a fever is not being propagated from man to man; and inferences entirely at variance with facts are deduced from a mistaken view of the nature of the prevailing fever. Another very common misapprehension is, that, for example in a jail community, the ordinary fevers of August and September degenerate into a typhus in the end of the year. In several eases I have noted the true history as very different. As a rule, these jails have been infected by typhus in April and May, when the typhus season was coming to an end; the germ of contagion was lost sight of from June to October, although all this time continuing to infect the community, and ensuring a deadly outbreak lasting from November till June of the year following. Importance of distinguishing the difirent varieties of yellow fevers. The extreme importance of apprehending correctly the natural history of fevers in general, and of yellow fevers in particular, cannot be too strongly urged. Copland insists on the same thing in the very comprehensive sentence which follows:Chapter III.] EPIDEMIC FEVERS OF INDIA AND THEIR RELATION TO JAIL MORTALITY. 181 The succession of epidemics of malarious fevers. Epidemic of 1809. The earliest visitation is traditional, for little was known of Upper India at this time. I take this, reasoning back from modern data, to have been the mani- festation in Upper India of the epidemic fever of Chota Nag- pore of the end of 1807, of which I find an account in the Records of the Medical Board in 1808. The fever commenced in August, and was at its height in September, which fact alone shows it to have been a malarious fever, notwithstanding the severity of the symptoms. The Board were of the same opinion. On 18th April 1808, addressing Government, they write:182 STATISTICS OF THE JAIL POPULATION OF BENGAL FROM 1859 TO 1876. [Section III. the influence of the canal, although all are ready to admit the benefits that it otherwise confers upon the place and people." Epidemic of 1834. In 1834, writes Dr. Garden, fever was again terribly prevalent. The fever of this epoch is the epidemic which I associate with the typhus which for years after prevailed over Upper India. This fever of 1834 was also provinciallly distributed. It raged over Western Rajpootana (Ranken, p. 39), and I find that 179 deaths occurred among the native troops in Nusseerabad, Neemuch and Mhow. The Superintending Surgeon of Neemuch says, that the fever began in August at Nusseerabad and rapidly extended over Rajpootana, and the influence was partially felt as far south as Mhow. At Nusseerabad and Neemuch the sick of some corps exceeded one-third of the strength. In November, with the setting-in of the cold weather, the disease declined. What was called scurvy, was universal over the same tract in 1833-35, and the Pali plague appeared in 1836. The great famine of 1837 followed in the North-West, and from 1836 to 1838 there is a continuous record of the existence of typhus and relapsing fevers. Judging from parallel history, I take this to be the manifestation in Upper India of the deadly remittent of Twining and Martin, so fatal to the European community of Calcutta in 1833. Epidemic of 1844. The fever of 1843-44 was universal over Northern India. In Southern Scinde it did not prevail in power; for we are told expressly that the 78th reached Sukker from Kurrachee in good health on 25th October 1844, and that the regiment remained healthy until the beginning of Novem- ber, when the fever burst forth with unheard-of violence. General Napier, in his review of the Administration of Sir C. Napier in Scinde, writes: "Sir C. Napier arrived at Sukker on the 19th December. But no joyful state of affairs greeted his arrival. The pestilence was abroad, the European Artillery was entirely disabled, two hundred of the 78th dead, and others daily falling into their graves that seemed destined to swallow all. With anguish of mind their General was compelled to send the survivors to Hyderabad, instead of leading the whole, as he had hoped, to a glorious service. Nor did even this save them, and nearly as many more perished ere the sickness ceased."*Sir Charles Napier, writing on 19th December, says: "I have lost the 78th; that beautiful regiment arrived here in high health, and every other part of ScindeChapter III.] EPIDEMIC FEVERS OF INDIA AND THEIR RELATION TO JAIL MORTALITY. 183 edly be the case, the local source of the malaria in the East may be looked for. I can only indicate generally the fact that the malaria miasm has an abode in the same region from which we recognise that the cholera miasm issues, as we know by the manifestations which have deso- lated so many tracts of Lower Bengal in the past ten years. I believe that every epidemic invading Northern and Western India previously affects the Gangetic provinces or Chota Nagpore. In 1808, as in 1866, the epidemic is found crossing the Hazareebaugh plateau; the Calcutta fever of 1833 precedes the epidemic of 1834 in Western and Upper India; the Gangetic valley, as far east as Patna, is occupied by the epidemic of 1816; the fever of 1844 affects the Europeans at Ghazeepore as well as in Scinde and the Punjab; the fever of 1859, repressed out of Northern India by the famine meteorology until 1861, had its base in Raj- mehal, Rajshahye, and Purneah; the great malaria of Agra and Northern India of 1856 was preceded by the epidemic year 1855 in the East; the 80th Regiment was decimated by yellow malarious fever at Dinapore in 1849, and the 1st Fusiliers at Lahore, by the advance of the same epidemic in 1850. The sequence I hold to be natural, and not fortuitous. Localisation of epidemic malaria in Upper India. The subject illus- trated. The localities which malaria prefers are the same chosen by cholera. Naturally dry stations, such as Meean Meer or Nusseerabad, are stricken by malaria and by cholera as a moving epidemic. They suffer for a certain number of days or weeks from both epidemics, and into this short period much suffering may be compressed, although no true localisation has taken place. But many districts of Northern India invite both malaria and cholera to settle, and afford to both the opportunity of renewing their manifestations for months afterwards. The localisation of malaria is a point of very great interest. Moist tracts of Upper India have of late years retained the miasm as effectually as similar tracts within the endemic area in Lower Bengal. For the past ten years, these fevers have run a parallel course with those of Lower Bengal. They have formed the subject of many memoirs addressed to Government, called for in consequence of the deadly results which they have caused in the tract affected in the different years. Even before the mutiny, we had a notable example of the localisation of the epidemic fever of 1856. It settled in a portion of the Allyghur district, which was covered also by the great cholera of 1856. It died with the setting in of the cold season, after having in a few months cut off 34,000 persons. The bad fevers of Bolundshuhur, Allyghur or Mozuffernuggur are identical with those of Burdwan, Hooghly, or Nuddea; they appear, run their course and die out, and continue absent for a long series of years, and no one can say that the local conditions are different from what they were when the invasion took place. The entire disappearance of the terrible fever of Lower Bengal, last manifested as the Burdwan fever, is a case in point. The following are extracts from Mr. Cutcliffe's report to the Government of the North- Western Provinces on the fever of 1866-67, localised in the Saharunpore and Mozuffernuggur districts:184 STATISTICS OF THE JAIL POPULATION OF BENGAL FROM 1859 TO 1876. [Section III. fevers known to be enteric; the fever was not attended by the characteristic eruption, and bowel affections did not complicate the course of the fever. In my Cholera Report of 1868, I noticed a parallel case, that of Her Majesty's 79th Regi- ment in 1866-67, well illustrating the effects of a localised malaria. It throws light on the case of the 85th; and no suggestion was made that this outbreak was enteric in its nature, or resulted from the use of impure water. It was attributed, probably with reason, to early marching and the damp of an unhealthy camping ground. Nine men died from the fever. As a sequel to the fever, phthisis was in some cases developed, and 14 men died or were invalided on this account; and, also as sequelæ, there were 230 admissions on account of rheumatism and 54 from orchitis.

The former corps is stated to have had 519 in hospital at once, and to have buried 21 persons, including women and children, in one day, and upwards of 90 of its number within a mouth. This is a degree of mortality far exceeding anything on record in the medical annals of Bengal." This sickness, I find, went on up to the end of the year, when it abated. In November, the 66th Regiment lost 55 men, and the other three regiments 45 between them. Delhi and Saharunpore in those days represented our North-Western Frontier, but from an incidental observation contained in the Bombay reports, the usual provincial distribution much further to the west, may be inferred. In the same month, November 1816, it is stated that at Hyderabad in Scinde the population were then dying at the rate of sixty and seventy a day. The fever, no doubt of the same epidemic, progressing on the southern epidemic tract, seems to have reached Guzerat in the year before. The history of Cawnpore is repeated at Surat. Dr. Kennedy writes:186 STATISTICS OF THE JAIL POPULATION OF BENGAL FROM 1859 TO 1876.

As late as the spring of 1819, I find a record of relapsing fever in the Allahabad Jail. Ninety-eight prisoners, out of an average of 800, died between January and June. The disease is described as typhus mitior, a yellow fever with relapses. In the month of April, the Civil Surgeon writes:Chapter III.] EPIDEMIC FEVERS OF INDIA AND THEIR RELATION TO JAIL MORTALITY. 187 grew more prominent, and became soft and soon assumed a spongy hæmorrhagic appearance. The mouth and tongue got pallid, and the breath emitted a heavy sickening odour.

These sites got tumified, exceedingly tense and non-elastic, and having the skin over them of a colour un- naturally dark. They were more or less diffused, sometimes occupying the whole circumference and extent of the limb, which would have a shining polished appearance.

From the report of the Deputy Commissioner I think it may fairly be con- cluded that the fever affecting the district generally was purely a malarious fever. It is quite possible, however, that Dr.Rice did see typhus in Saugor early in 1859. In the Raipore Jail of the Central Provinces, I find that in the end of March a deadly fever broke out. Of nine cases in this month eight were fatal, and 21 prisoners in all died. The Civil Surgeon, writing in April, says, that although fever was very prevalent, the cases in the civil hospital did not take on the same severe character. except in the case of two or three pilgrims. The relapsing fever of 1859192 STATISTICS OF THE JAIL POPULATION OF BENGAL FROM 1859 TO 1876. [Section III was very hot and dry, emitting a most powerful and offensive odour. The whole body was more or less coloured by jaundice, and the conjunctivæ were deeply stained. He rapidly sank. The following morning the body was immensely swollen and discoloured, and so putrid as to render it impossible to make a post-mortem examination." The germ of such a fever as this, which naturally terminates in June, might survive in an aborted form to become the origin of a great outbreak of relapsing typhus, beginning when the season normal for the re-appearance of typhus came round. As an instance, in the end of November 1864, true relapsing typhus burst out in the native jail at Jeypore, and 189 prisoners died.*The medical officer says expressly, that the peculiarity of the fever of 1864-65 was, that it assumed the recurring type: "No less than 85 patients were attacked three times, out of which number 19 died." This outbreak was the re-development in a milder form, of a deadly yellow continued fever which prevailed in the year previous. Its severity may be judged of by one sentence from the Jail Report of 1863:Chapter III. ] EPIDEMIC FEVERS OF INDIA AND THEIR RELATION TO JAIL MORTALITY. 193 (rarely more than half an ounce) of florid blood in small coagula, is expectorated.

Native reports mention, that at Rampore the people attacked threw up blood almost at the first onset of the disease, and died a few hours afterwards. If this account can be depended on, then we have here the description of the "black death," or worst form of plague, described by Hecker in his" Epidemics of the Middle Ages."* Surgeon-Major Tresidder, Jhansi, April 1865. "A severe and mortal disease is prevalent among the natives. A shivering fit is succeeded by a hot skin, and then hæmorrhage from the nose and vomit- ing of dark-coloured blood takes place, and death rapidly supervenes. I have examined this disease, and am of opinion that it is a severe form of fever occurring in patients who have scurvy, in whom the mucous membrane allows the blood to pass through during the hot stage. This state of scurvy is now very common, and I think it is owing to the poor not having had their usual and neces- sary supply of green vegetable food in consequence of the very dry season which has passed.

In several instances, within a few hours, the pulse sunk so as to be barely perceptible; and the features became dark and sombre, and of a cadaveric appearance. On these symptoms followed subsultus of the tendons, tremors of the tongue, hiccough, incessant vomiting of a bilious watery fluid, and occasionally attacks of sudden and severe epistaxis. In other cases again, the fever continued from day to day with barely a trace of remission; the tongue was dry and parched; there was continued vomiting, and the heat of the skin was intense. The pulse was small and feeble; and it gradually became tremulous and indistinct, and extremely quick; and with this, the patient would be seized with sudden and acute pneumonia or bron- chitis. In another series of cases, the attack was exceedingly sudden. The patient was seized all at once while in the performance of some duty. For example, a man in most robust health, was attacked whilst drawing water from a well; another who on the previous evening was able to perform his duties as a soldier, was seized in the morning and before night was a corpse, and this man was considered one of the strongest in the regiment. "The rigour which in such instances marked the onset of the disease, was rapidly followed by intense and ardent heat of skin, severe pains in the limbs and loins, frontal headache with vivid flushing of the face, suffusion of the eyes, throbbing of the carotids, extreme thirst, and exceedingly rapid pulse. Soon to these symptons were added vomiting of a bitter watery fluid, evidently in some cases containing bile. The vomiting in some cases was so frequent as greatly to harass the patient; and it was accompanied by extreme tenderness on pressure, both in the epigastrium and right hypochondrium. Gradually jaundice ensued, first faintly traceable in the conjunctivæ, but afterwards suffusing the entire surface of the body. "For the most part the febrile action never entirely intermitted, though in nearly all the eases a remission occurred about 4 o'clock every morning, and continued about two hours. This remission was followed by an exacerbation of all the symptoms. "From day to day the patient lost strength; the pulse became weaker, and more and more quick; the tongue lost its moisture and became brown and fissured; sordes formed upon the teeth; the jaundice deepened; the burning heat of skin rather increased than diminished; the vomiting grew more urgent; tenderness and enlargement of the liver and spleen continued; the bowels remained constipated, and the loss of appetite amounted to absolute loathing of food. "Sometimes this downward progress was so extremely quick as to afford little or no opportunity for the intervention of medicine. For, as above stated, one man died of the disease certainly within 36 hours after the attack; and in another man, three days sufficed to bring the disease to a fatal termination." "But a remarkable feature of the disease, not however constantly exhibited, was a spon- taneous subsidence of all the symptoms on certain days; which after a time, I began to regard as critical days, namely, the 5th, 7th, 9th, 14th, and 21st. The patient expressed himself as quite well, though feeling weak. But while the patient would apparently be convalescing in the most satisfactory manner the symptoms of the disease would return without any cause, and continue, though much less severe than during the primary attack. These secondary attacks likewise terminated within 7, 9, 14, or 21 days; ordinarily, however, they lasted no more than 5 days. "I should remark that the spontaneous resolution of the disease was generally accom- panied by profuse sweating. It was further characterised by a remarkable coldness of the skin; which seemed to the touch as if the body had just been removed after a long immersion in very cold water. With this, the pulse fell so as to be about 50 per minute, and it was so feeble and flickering as to excite the greatest alarm for weak subjects; and the countenance also was expressive of extreme exhaustion. In fatal cases not the faintest trace of perspiration was perceptible during the course of the disease; and, what was very remarkable, the burning heat of skin continued when the pulse at the wrist had ceased, and for some little time after death. In one case there was delirium with great restlessness and jactitation; in another, the deli- rium was followed by sleepnessness, and the patient remained without ever closing the eyelids, for upwards of 72 hours. The same man was obstinately silent, and endeavoured constantly to get out of bed, and he refused to take anything except from my hands. That he was con- scious was shown by his ready obedience to my orders, and by his invariably selecting me when I came to his bedside.*" The fever simultaneously going on in the same cantonment is referred to by the Surgeon of the 7th Fusiliers, in these terms: 7th Fusiliers, Ferozepore 1864, Surgeon Hendley. "After the arrival of the Regiment at Ferozepore and until the weather began to get hot the cases of fever were in no way peculiar. But towards the end of May, the fevers were observed to be much more obstinate, and to present unusual symptoms denoting great constitutional debility. In the cases of remittent fever the symptoms were the most serious. Such fever commenced as intermittent, and became remittent after a few days. From the time of admission the pulse was very feeble, and the bodily strength entirely prostrated. The heat of the body was *Compare the case of Herophon, as given by Hippocrates: "He was seized with an acute fever, aggravated on the 5th day and attended with distension of the hypochondrium and spleen, and by constipation. He was delirious and deaf. "On the 9th day he sweated; the crisis took place, and the fever ceased. "On the 5th day afterwards the fever relapsed, and the spleen became swollen. On the evening of the 3rd day after- wards be sweated, and the spleen diminished; and finally the crisis took place on the 17th day, He had no disorder of the senses during the relapse."

" In some of the worst of these cases, there were regular symptoms of scurvy after the fever had gone; spongy and bleeding gums, ecchymosis, and anasarca of the lower extremities, and hæmorrhage from the nose and bowels. " Recovery was very tardy. Twelve of the sufferers were only capable of performing light duty six months after their first attack, and a few are even yet unfit for duty of any kind, and so they are likely to continue for some time to come. "There was a great tendency to congestive inflammation of the lungs, liver, and spleen, and to neuralgic affections: for months after the fever had disappeared, patients continued to suffer from sciatica, and even now on the occurrence of any slight ailment, the tendency becomes developed. " In remittent cases quinine seemed to do more harm than good. It seemed that the fever wore itself out, and the evident indication was to support the strength. "In bad cases when the strength was gradually failing and symptoms of congestion of the lungs were becoming daily more apparent, permission was obtained to send the patients to Kasauli; and although they travelled in the middle of June all ultimately recovered. " In all four deaths resulted from this disease; one fatal case is shown in the return as remittent fever; the other three patients relapsed after convalescence, and as they presented marked symptoms of pneumonia, their cases were returned under that heading." Pneumonic typhus of the 38th Regiment. The same variety in jails. Another British regiment was similarly affected, while relapsing fever prevailed among the native troops and in the jail; Her Majesty's 38th Regi- ment suffered at Delhi from this fever. The fever is described as of malarious origin, the symptoms being regarded as those of remittent or continued fever. The report, however, proceeds to allude to the lung complication as something not usually seen in the course of a malarious fever, in these terms: " A very bad symptom, and one which I never before observed at any station in India, namely, atonic inflammation of the lungs, appeared in many cases of this malarious fever, and nearly all the fatal cases were consequent upon this complication. The symptoms in each case were similar. A color sergeant aged 26, of most temperate habits, on the 5th day after admission from simple febrile symptoms, was attacked by general pleuro-pneumonia. Four days afterwards symptoms of typhus set in, delirium, sordes on the teeth, retention of urine, and involuntary evacuations; and he died on the 21st day from admission." The appearance of the lungs as seen after death, is described, and the report concludes:196 STATISTICS OF THE JAIL POPULATION OF BENGAL FROM 1859 TO 1876. [Section III. Week ending 21st August. "Twelve cases of acute dysentery (typhoid) remained from last week, and ten were admitted into hospital during this week: of the former five have since proved fatal. Four of those were men admitted during the present epidemic, and one was a patient attacked in hospital. Week ending 28th August. " Four cases of dysentery have been attacked with symptoms of acute hepatitis during the week. Three of these cases suffered from the epidemic form of the disease, and were convalescent when attacked. The patients who do get over the acute symptoms are so reduced that their convalescence is very slow. Week ending 4th September. " Two men have died during the week returned under the head of Hepatitis. In both cases a large abscess was found in the left lobe of the liver. The type of the epidemic has undergone a marked change during last week. The alvine discharges containing more feculent matter and less blood. The great prostration of strength and insomnolency formerly dwelt on, is now seldom observed, and all the cases at present under treatment are doing well. " The possible significance of con- tagious dysentery. The objection which naturally suggests itself is not altogether inconsistent with the possi- bility of typhus poisoning in this instance. Change of type might be anticipated with manifestation at an abnormal season; just as the pneumonic type predominates in the spring in Northern. India, so in the season normal for the development of bowel complaints, we should not be surprised to see the typhusChapter III. EPIDEMIC FEVERS OF INDIA AND THEIR RELATION TO JAIL MORTALITY. 197 "Sometimes these cases have merged into hæmorrhagic dysentery. The stools are large and watery, of a brick-dust red colour, and finally assume a darker hue with black sloughs floating on the surface. No patient has recovered in whom these gangrenous sloughs have persisted for any time. "Some of the patients have never suffered from intermittent fever." Contagious dysentery of former times not now met with. Dysentery of Dinapore of 1849-50. The possibility of dysentery, whether due to a typhus source or not, becoming contagious, is apt to be overlooked in these days when all is so much changed, and, therefore, I add the following to impress the fact:198 STATISTICS OF THE JAIL POPULATION OF BENGAL FROM 1859 TO 1876. [ Section III. The loss of life caused by the transfer of prisoners already infected into healthy jails has been enormous; indeed, I may safely affirm that not in a single instance has true relapsing fever appeared in a jail unless introduced from without. I have spoken of the introduction of this fever into the Alipore Jail in 1860. In the Gya Jail report, I trace the history of this gang on its way down the Trunk Road. Forty- five prisoners were left behind at Shergotty, and were brought over to Gya in carts. Of these only 14 survived. How contagious fever may be introduced by new prisoners is instructively set forth in the following narrative by Dr. Kilkelly, of Allyghur, who saved his jail by the precautions taken. This case occurred at the time when typhus was so prevalent over Central India in 1865. As I have already said, quarantine wards are now recognised as a necessity:Chapter III.] EPIDEMIC FEVERS OF INDIA AND THEIR RELATION TO JAIL MORTALITY. 199 (Delhi) at the time 100 prisoners left here for Umballa, on the 1st of April last year.* On or about the 15th April my predecessor records a suspicious case or two, and from that time till the end of June it prevailed. It was relapsing fever, and jaundice occurred in a good many cases. It was in no respect typhus or typhoid. It was infectious beyond all doubt, and deadly to a degree.' This was Dr. Penny's answer. Dr. Newton, Civil Surgeon of Kurnaul, writes, dating 4th February 1865: "I recollect very well the two prisoners left here to die from the gang which left Delhi for Umballa on 1st April last. They were admitted into jail on 14th April 1864, one with decided jaundice and remittent fever, and the other had symptoms nearly the same. Neither had typhus eruption. "The Umballa jail was in fair healthy condition up to the time of the arrival of this Delhi gang. The Delhi gang started off the remittent fever, which continued till it merged into the relapsing fever. The epidemic broke out in the rainy season, or just at its close. The prisoners at this time were sleeping very close together, and from the depressing effects of the rains were physically at the minimum of ability to resist the epidemic influence. Their air was humid and stagnant. To sum up: the Umballa jail sickness of 1864 notably increased on the arrival of the Delhi gang, two of whose original number had died on the way of a yellow remittent fever; about the time these two were dying, relapsing fever had commenced at the place they came from; the first three cases of remittent fever here in 1864 were from this Delhi gang, and the remittent fever never ceased up to its merging into relapsing fever. From all this I come to the conclusion, that the specific disease was brought by the Delhi gang, and the foul air of the dormitories during the sultry humid August was the propagating medium." In the outbreak 123 prisoners died. The germ of an outbreak introduc- ed months before is apt to be over- looked in consequence of the tempo- rary decay of the typhus poison. The Lahore jail outbreak of 1863-64, in which 335 prisoners were lost, illustrates typically the method of working of the zymotic agent. This outbreak was looked on as due to the degeneration of a malari- ous remittent prevalent during the rains. 200 STATISTICS OF THE JAIL POPULATION OF BENGAL FROM 1859 TO 1876. [Section III. "Mr. Whyte remarked that every case admitted into his hospital had the symptoms of pneumonia. "At the end of the season the disease wore the form of a mild continued fever. "The resemblance which some cases shown and of others described to me, bore to the West Indian fever struck me very forcibly." Typhus in vessels leaving Calcutta during typhus periods. Typhus of Réunion. The typhus fever of 1864 was introduced into the Demerara emigration depet at the end of the year. Six vessels left Calcutta between 18th November and 15th March, carrying 2,700 souls. Out of these, 868 died during the voyage or in hospitals after landing. The disease was typhus. There was no overcrowding to account for the outbreak, and enquiry failed to show that the fever originated on board spontaneously. The Sanitary Commissioner investigated the history of this calamity with the greatest care (Proceedings, February 1866, pages 100-127). Only 258 emigrants were from Lower Bengal; the rest were from Upper India where typhus was raging, and they were in the depet a few days only before embarkation. Men of the same gang who had not sailed, died in the depôt at the date at which the fever appeared on board the ships that had left. The fact put forward, that contagious fevers might originate on board ship, only served to obscure the great truth, that in this instance they did not so originate, and that the subtile nature of the typhus poison prevented the recognition of this fever before embarka- tion. In the same year (1865), I was asked by the French Consul for information regarding this fever, which had made great havock in Réunion, and was said to have been imported with coolies from Calcutta. Acknowledging the information sent, the chief medical officer writes, dating Saint Denis, December 5th: "I fear the fever will recommence in 1866, although now extinct. * * * In the course of the epidemic the disease has varied much; in some cases it was not to be distinguished from yellow fever. One location has lost 64 out of 400 employed. The disease is the same described by Dr. Walker (whose report was forwarded). It is eminently contagious, and three medical officers have died." In the early months of 1865, the same fever seems to have broken out among the emigrants to Assam, although the depôt agents did not recognise it in Calcutta.

Table showing the Deaths from Contagious Fevers, typhus and relapsing, which have occurred in the more important outbreaks between 1859 and 1873, and the relation of the outbreaks to the influences prevalent at the different seasons of the year Chapter III.] EPIDEMIC FEVERS OF INDIA AND THEIR RELATION TO JAIL MORTALITY. 205 The mortality following the intro- duction of relapsing fever into jails, and the season of its prevalence illustrated. Fifty-one outbreaks are here figured; but many of these are double, presenting the spring outbreak, the decay, and the renewal, often with extreme virulence, with the setting in of the cold season. The story told throughout is absolutely consistent, if we except the mortality of the Meerut jail in 1861, the correct history of which we do not know. At any time during the typhus season the fever may be brought into a jail; but whether introduced early or late in the typhus season, decay or extinction occurs in May and June. Persistence in a state of decay through July, August, and September implies generally a deadly outbreak to follow in the cold season. Grouped as a body, the deaths of fifty outbreaks (excluding the Meerut jail mortality). show the relation to season thus:206 STATISTICS OF THE JAIL POPULATION OF BENGAL FROM 1859 TO 1876. [Section III. spark thrown in from without. The tendency has been to exaggerate these in order that the erroneous theory may be borne out. As I have already clearly shown, it is in healthy jail communities that these fevers have been developed, and not as the rule among prisoners suffering from want or pre-existing disease. The theory is not the less dangerous for being based on the fact that contagious fevers may, under certain conditions, arise without the inter- vention of the specific typhus poison. The treacherous nature of the poison, which holds out the promise of amendment and of the disappearance of the fever, has led many astray; the epidemic is surely on the advance, while the observer stops to speculate as to whether the condition of his prisoners is due to scurvy and under-feeding, to defective ventilation and overcrowding, or to the fever which he expects every autumn to find in his jail, just as among the free population. Good dieting will not prevent the spread of typhus, if typhus be present; robust health may delay, but will not ward off the attack of typhus; nor will the absence of overcrowding, however it may conduce to a comparatively favourable result, cause the outbreak to die. The nature of the zymotic poison must be apprehended, and the measures taken must recognise the natural history of the object whose death these measures are designed to bring about. In the jail at Umballa, in 1864, 237 men died from this fever; a partition wall cutting off the lock-up and female prisoners from the others, prevented in a single instance the spread beyond the infected squares. To define the stage or stages in which this fever is capable of propagation from man to man is of supreme importance. It seems impossible to account for the wonderfully increasing ratio of attack month by month, occurring in spite of all precautions, unless by the supposition that there is a stage antecedent to the actual onset, in which typhus will spread among a closely- packed body of men. The suspicion naturally occurs that, while the poison is circulating in the system, and before the fever stage is reached, those already stricken are passing on the contagion to others shut up with them, and occupying the same dormitories. The character- istic absence of all premonitory signs before the actual attack, renders this all the more probable; and daily weeding out from among the apparently healthy of those attacked has not availed to bring the outbreak to a termination. I might have impressed the facts here set forth by many further illustrations. But it has been my wish to shorten the paper as much as possible, and, therefore, I have selected typical examples only, which bear on the main points to be illustrated. While the medical history of these eighteen years is in many respects a sad one, the diminution of mortality by one-half in the last half of the period, holds out good promise for the future; and the progress made we trust to see interrupted by few great disasters, such as those which have left their stamp on the statistics of these years.

SECTION IV. THE CHOLERA HISTORY OF 1875 AND 1876, ILLUSTRATING HOW THE AREA OF HINDOSTAN WHEN UNOCCUPIED IS RE-INVADED BY EPIDEMIC CHOLERA. CHAPTER I. THE DYING OUT OF CHOLERA OVER HINDOSTAN IN 1873 AND 1874, AND THE MINIMUM REACHED. The succession of epidemics is in India a recognised fact. The fact should be recognised in countries in- vaded from India. The history of cholera in India is written naturally in the record of individual epidemics, which come on in succession at intervals of years. The cholera of one epidemic is not the cholera of the epidemic which suc- ceeds. This is the conclusion to which every careful observer in India has arrived; and in the case of every appearance of cholera beyond the boundaries of Hindostan, it is essential that the local recorder should recog- nise each successive epidemic as it shows itself in India as a possible origin of the mani- festation. All statements which tell of cholera beyond India being prolonged for an indefinite number of years must be weighed with reference to the results of observation in India continued. year by year; for no foreign observer is in a position, from his personal experience alone or from local tradition, to form a just estimate of the epidemic relations of a cholera which has sprung up around him. Individual opinions formed from inadequate data cannot be entertained when antagonistic to a universally accepted generalisation based on the widest knowledge of facts; and no one would venture to say that the laws regulating successive manifestations of cholera have been more carefully studied and appreciated in the semi-barbarous countries to which these remarks chiefly refer, than by the large staff of highly educated officers who in this country are ever on the watch for the first traces of a threatened epidemic. The succession of epidemics in India is not caused by the local re-development of a dormant cholera, revived by the recurrence of physical conditions favourable to life and growth. The re-appearance of cholera after several successive seasons of decay or disappearance implies in Northern and Western and Southern India, the movement of a new body of cholera, out of Eastern Bengal, pro- gressing on aërial highways, and occupying, in obedience to definite laws, the geographical areas into which the great continent of India is subdivided by natural characteristics. Secondary manifestations, subsequent to the occupation of natural areas, follow also known parallels, and are controlled by the influences proper to the area within which the cholera of invasion finds itself. The rapid recurrence of epidemics is one of the characteristics of the cholera of our times. Geography of the successive epi- demics of the past eleven years, and its significance in each case. In the past eleven years five new epidemics have moved on. Northern India, namely, the cholera of 1864-65, 1866-67, 1868-69. 1872 and 1875. Every one of these epidemics has had some distinguishing geographical feature. The first, which desolated the Central Provinces and Western India, was in Northern India a shadow merely. The second, abandoning the route leading to the Central Provinces and Western. India, was diverted entirely into Northern India, leaving the area occupied by the epidemic of 1864-65 untouched. The third, pursuing both routes, occupied Central, Western, and Northern. India, from the mountains to the Indian Ocean. The epidemic of 1872 covered Northern India and a great part of Western India, and left the eastern districts of the Central Provinces untouched. All of this has been mapped out definitely and clearly. The facts of distribution are absolute, and cannot be set aside. The legitimate deduction seems to be, that the materies of any epidemic is at the disposal of natural meteorological agencies which cause it to play the part which it does in relation to space. Assuming the presence of a body of cholera in the East, we cannot predict its future course. It may occupy the southern epidemic highway alone; it may show itself solely on the northern epidemic highway; or both may be occupied at the same or different dates, during the progress of epidemic invasion. The phenomena of advance these different routes have Leen carefully studied in my previous reports. Decay of cholera throughout 1873 and 1874. The year 1873 passed over without any indication of renewed invasion; and throughout the year the invading cholera of 1872 was rapidly going to decay. A large proportion of the material of the epidemic of 1872 had also been removed out of the area of Hindostan, as we know by the circumstance that the cholera of that year prevailed simultaneously over Northern. India and in distant provinces of Central Asia. In August 1873, replying to an enquiry from the Government of India as to the chance of our cantonments in Upper India becoming affected by cholera before the close of the year, I made the following remarks:274 EPIDEMIC CHOLERA OF INDIA OF 1875 AND 1876. [Section IV. which is almost certain to occur should the epidemic advance be arrested anywhere in the con- tinent of India." The minimum which was reached in 1874. This deduction, which was again borne out in the epidemic history of 1875 and 1876, as will be subsequently shown, was verified; and the mini- mum reached in 1873 dwindled in nearly every district of the epidemic area to nothing, so that the registration of cholera deaths in 1874 was, from north to south and from east to west, almost a blank throughout the three Presidencies of India. The Bombay Presidency registered 37 cholera deaths in all. In Ganjam, which gets its cholera in common with Orissa, 243 deaths were registered. Leaving out this tract, the whole area of the Madras Presidency gave 70 deaths, of which the greater number were probably erroneously returned. In the Berars two deaths only were returned out of the entire population. In the Central Provinces two deaths were recorded. I except twelve, which occurred in Sum- bulpore, a district associated as regards its cholera with Bengal Proper and Orissa. The Punjab shows a total of 79 cholera deaths. Rajpootana reported four deaths only. Oudh, one of the worst cholera fields in India, had but 68 deaths. Goruckpore and the districts adjoining suffered from epidemic cholera, and had upwards of 5,000 deaths. But leaving out these, the mortality for the whole of the remaining area of the North-Western Provinces was under 1,100. The following statement shows how the cholera of 1872 ran down throughout 1873 and 1874 in the epidemic area of India.:Chapter I.] THE DYING OUT OP CHOLERA OVER HINDOSTAN IN 1873 AND 1874. 275 recorded in the six months. But in the latter six months 5,000 people were carried off in these two districts. This cholera was almost entirely localised. Azimgurh, lying next to Goruckpore, was slightly affected, losing 250; and the Fyzabad district of Oudh, bounding the cholera tract on the west, had 16 deaths in November and December, which I should attribute to a new epidemic distribution of cholera late in 1874. Leaving out these 16 deaths, the province of Oudh had 3 deaths only during the time that the adjoining districts were affected; and Jaunpore immediately to the south had only 2 deaths amongst its population. In the districts lying between Oudh and the Central Provinces, 52 deaths only appear in the registers of 1874:276 EPIDEMIC CHOLERA OF INDIA OF 1875 AND 1876. [Section IV. inclined to associate with that which caused the 267 deaths of August and September of Wardah, in the Godavery district of the Central Provinces, and striking out the deaths from January to June, there remain in Southern India 207 cholera deaths only to be accounted for of the total registered in 1872. Death at cholera in the Bombay Presidency in March 1873. While the Madras cholera of 1872 was dying out in March 1873, it was dying out also in Bombay except in Bombay city, which registered 40 deaths from April to December, and which were probably attributed to cholera by error. Not a single death from cholera was registered throughout the Presidency after March in any district south of the Tapti. In the four southern districts in which it survived during the three first months of 1873 the disappearance was simultaneous. The phenomena of invasion, decay and re-appearance, in the different provinces are perfectly exhibited in the registration tables for the series of years 1873 to 1876, which bear conspicuously on their face the stamp which nature alone can impress.
Chapter II.] RE-OCCUPATION OF THE EPIDEMIC AREA IN THE SPRING OF 1875.277 CHAPTER II. THE RE-APPEARANCE OF CHOLERA WITHIN THE UNOCCUPIED AREA IN THE SPRING OF 1875. The cholera of the spring of 1875 did not re-appear over India follow- ing human intercourse. How it did appear, and parallel occurrences as illustrative of the phenomena. Whether human intercourse was the cause of the first appearance of the new epidemic from the Himalayas to Southern India in the spring of 1875, need not be discussed. The local observers are content to admit that it did not appear by any such agency, and local reports only sug- gest the possible effects of human agency subsequent to the re-appearance of cholera in their districts. Three propositions may be offered as explanatory of the phenomena of re-appearance278 EPIDEMIC CHOLERA OF INDIA OF 1875 AND 1876. [Section IV. two cholera deaths only had been registered, and in the same period two deaths only in the Jhansi district adjoining. At Lullutpore, on the 28th October 1874, a native officer of the 28th Native Infantry was struck down with cholera in the morning, and he died in the after- noon. There was no cholera reported in the district at the time, and none appeared throughout the epidemic of 1875. This solitary case of cholera I consider to have been a true index of movement, and this I represented to the Sanitary Commissioner as soon as I recorded the death. And early in the spring, when the very first symptoms of the re-awakening of cholera showed themselves, I represented to the Quarter Master General of the Army that the material of an epidemic had already been distributed, against which it was necessary to be prepared, seeing that manifestation was certain to occur at the proper date. What, under such conditions, is the geographical area already covered no one but an empiric would profess to say; manifesta- tion alone can declare the course followed and the limit reached. Dates at which the spring cholera of 1875 was manifested over India. Leaving out of consideration meantime the debateable pointsChapter II.] RE-OCCUPATION OF THE EPIDEMIC AREA IN THE SPRING OF 1875. 279 In the first quarter of 1875, 30 cholera deaths only were registered in the entire Presi- dency of Madras. The deaths of April in the Tinnevelly and Tanjore districts, which furnished 74 out of the 84 cholera deaths of the Presidency, were the true indices of the commencing epidemic. Cholera broke out in Tinnevelly on 14th April, and in Tanjore on 17th April. Trichinopoly was attacked in May, the cholera commencing on the 18th. Cholera had been epidemic in the sea-coast districts of Ceylon for three months before, and about 400 deaths had occurred-16 in January, 70 in February, and 281 in March, when this cholera culminated, the numbers in April running down to 102. The Officiating Sanitary Commissioner writes: "I do not intend to express any opinion upon the origin of the epidemic which began in April 1875." In the next sentence, however, he proceeds to make a very decided theoretical statement: "It is obvious," he says, "that our epidemic of 1875 did not come from the north, but from the south-east;" and the inference he leaves to be drawn is, that the cholera of the Madras Presidency, which cut off nearly 100,000 of the population in 1875, was imported from Ceylon into the districts affected in the spring, having previously been imported from somewhere else into Ceylon. Ceylon exempted in1874, as well as the Continent of India. The Island of Ceylon registered only two cholera deaths from September to December 1874, and eleven in all during the year; in short, Ceylon enjoyed in 1874 the same immunity from cholera as the Continent of India. I have no record to show or suggest where the cholera of Ceylon did come from. Theoretically, when I trace as one and the same phenomenon the re-appearance of cholera from the Himalayas to the extreme south-west of the Bombay Presidency, I look for the extension of the margin of the fan, and I find its extremity in Ceylon, and I associate the appearance of cholera in February and March with the homologous reproduction of cholera in Oudh and the eastern districts of our North-Western Provinces in the same weeks; and the occurrence of the first cholera in Madras on 14th and 17th April cannot be passed over without at least calling attention to the fact that these very days saw the Bombay Presidency covered simultaneously in many districts. In the face of the picture which I have drawn, I cannot adopt the suggestion unless backed by the actual facts of importation. No do I find the statement that, from the districts affected in the spring, cholera spread gradually into every district, borne out by the statistical facts. The method of the filling-in of the area mapped out by the spring cholera of 1875, is a subject which cannot be treated in so general a manner, and will again be reverted to in studying the behaviour of the same cholera in Madras during the monsoon season of 1875. First appearance of cholera in the Berars. Berars.280 EPIDEMIC CHOLERA OF INDIA OF 1875 AND 1876. [Section IV. First appearance of cholera in Rajpootana. "The year 1875 was again an epidemic season. The first intimation of cholera was in the end of April, from Bhurtpore, and on May 10th some cases occurred at Sookait in Holkar's territory." Again Dr. Moore writes:Chapter II.] RE-OCCUPATION OF THE EPIDEMIC AREA IN THE SPRING OF 1875. 281 Just as at Nasik, and in the same week, an outbreak occurred at Jaleysur in the Agra district, in anticipation of the cholera due three weeks later; and between the 12th and 15th April, the indices showing the existence of the repressed cholera appeared, Saint Peter's College, which suffered in the preceding epidemic, again showing the earliest predisposition to the attack. Area of repression in the Central Provinces. In the Central Provinces with the exception of the Tapti and Western Nerbudda districts on the west, and in the Raipur and Bilaspur districts in the east which are naturally associated with the cholera of Bengal, up to the end of May the cholera registration was nearly a blank: Jubbulpore gave 2 deaths, Murwara, in the Vindhyan tract, 18; and Betul 12. This cholera spread neither in Jubbulpore nor Murwara, and Betul did not register another case until July. Jubbulpore, the great railway centre, tapping the cholera-stricken Nerbudda Valley on the one hand and the cholera stricken Gangetic Valley on the other, returned for the whole of 1875, 11 deaths only out of a resident population of 383,000, and this not as a consequence of the inability of cholera to localise itself, for this same district lost nearly 8,000 of its population in the epidemic of 1868-69. Repression in four districts of the Berara. While the Nerbudda and Tapti districts immediately to the north suffered throughout April and May, the cholera of May affected two only of the six districts of the Berars, and these the most westerly. Not a single death was registered in the four remaining districts lying to the east282 EPIDEMIC CHOLERA. OF INDIA OF 1875 AND 1876. [Section IV. The cholera which appeared in Oudh ran parallel with the revitalisation of the cholera of Goruckpore and Busti in 1875, after taking into account that 50 deaths, out of 56 registered in February, occurred in the extreme south of the province*:283 Chapter III.] RE-OCCUPATION OF THE EPIDEMIC AREA IN THE SPRING OF 1875. CHAPTER III. THE GENERAL PHENOMENA ATTENDING THE OCCUPATION OF THE CHOLERA AREA OF THE SPRING OF 1875. The cholera of the spring of 1875 was neither introduced by human intercourse, nor locally grown from pre-existing germs. The field to be occupied was a vacant one, and all experience has taught us that in any area of India unoccupied for two years in succession, invasion from without, and invasion only, will cause the re-appearance of cholera. It is from within the endemic area in Eastern Bengal that this cholera of invasion comes,284 EPIDEMIC CHOLERA OF INDIA OF 1875 AND 1876. [Section IV. The following is the memorandum:Chapter III.] PHENOMENA ATTENDING THE RE-APPEARANCE OF CHOLERA IN 1875. 285 revives. But I see nothing improbable in the suggestion that cholera may be distributed in its dormant state as well as in its vital condition." These were the circumstances which induced me to attach so great an importance to the first case in our types that showed itself in the epidemic area of Upper India in succession to the epidemic of 1872; and to report to the Sanitary Commissioner that I associated the occur- rence of this undoubted case of cholera, which, as before mentioned, occurred at Lullutpore on 28th October 1874, with renewed epidemic distribution, the extent of which was to be determined only by the spring manifestations of 1875. The cholera of the endemic area preceding and accompanying the new cholera of 1874-75. Was there evidence of the presence of a body of cholera epidemic within the endemic area sufficient to account for an overflow involving Western and Northern India ? These figures show that in the last ten days of October, the exact date at which endemic cholera is due to come forward after its annual disappearance, a great epidemic commenced; and 60,000 deaths were registered in Bengal Proper before the middle of 1875, and 116,606 in all before the end of the year, against a total of 57,000 in 1874. The culmination in Lower Bengal of the spring cholera of March and April I take to be the homologue of the simultaneous culmination in the Gangetic Provinces and in Oudh already shown, the cholera being of one and the same growth. And I take it to have been the very same material which became evident in Ceylon in January, February and March, and in Southern, Western and Northern India in the middle of April; which, over certain areas, was fostered into epidemic strength in May, and was in others anchored down until set free with the advent of the monsoon after 20th June.

In its own breeding grounds cholera has the power of manifestation in October, November and December; beyond the endemic area this power of mani- festation is lost or impaired. And although cholera may be epidemically spread in October as well as in spring or during the monsoon season, the material so diffused is inert or comparatively inert, until certain in- fluences cause it to come into manifest life, earlier or later according to the situation occupied, but at dates fixed and normal for each province and locality. And the inference we draw is, that the great fan-shaped area, of which Eastern Bengal is the handle, and the line occupied by the spring cholera of 1875 the circumference, was covered in the last months of 1874 by a cholera which lay dormant until 15th April. Over the area marked out by the spring cholera, after the middle of October blows from Northern and Eastern Bengal, the north-east monsoon. As I write, on 20th October 1877, its burst for the year is announced. In his report for 1875, the Sanitary Commissioner for the Central Provinces writes: "The wind changed to the north, and in the third and fourth weeks of October rain fell generally over the province. Through October, November, and December the prevailing wind was from the north-east, which is the normal direction at that season of the year." And the report for the last weeks of October 1874286 EPIDEMIC CHOLERA OF INDIA OF 1875 AND 1876. [Section IV. CHAPTER IV. THE CHOLERA OF THE MONSOON OF 1875. Meteorology of the third week of June over Central and Upper India. In the third week of June the south-west monsoon set in fairly over the Central Provinces and Upper India. Regarding the Central Provinces, Dr. Townsend writes: "In many of the districts north of the Satpuras, no rain fell either in March, April or May. The monsoon rains commenced in the second week of June. In that week south-westerly winds, with heavy falls of rain prevailed over the districts south and east of the Satpuras, but it was not until the following week that heavy rain fell in the northern districts." As regards Bengal Proper, it is remarked that in May the easterly direction of the wind was much more strongly marked than usual, and this feature was accompanied by a rainfall much in excess of the average; and the reporter for the north-west notes, that easterly winds brought many showers during May. At the end of the first week of June the monsoon current began to set in from the east, although up to the end of the month the distribution was still partial. The monsoon in Northern India was good and normal. Mr. Planck observes:Chapter IV.] THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE MONSOON CHOLERA OF 1875. 287 In the Himalayas288 EPIDEMIC CHOLERA OF INDIA OF 1875 AND 1876. [Section IV. Chanda registered its first case on 1st August, and Warora, the circle of Chanda, which lost in the month 127 out of 167 cases, showed cholera first on 6th August.

This cholera of Cuddapah culminated in three additional circles before the middle of July, thus showing a special occupation of this area. It is from the 15th July onwards that the invasion of monsoon cholera must be reckoned. Now, Bellary, Kurnool, half of Cuddapah, Nellore, North Arcot, Madras, Chingleput,*Mysore, the Neilgherries and Hyderabad first showed cholera. Excluding the three circles of Cuddapah, 88 circles were entered, and these were the dates:293 Chapter IV.] THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE MONSOON CHOLERA OF 1875. registered only 52 deaths in all, and most of these towards the end of the year when renewed invasion from the north might have been looked for. The deaths of Malabar, 10 in number, spread over the first six months of 1875, may also be excluded, since they are in all probability due to error in registration. From January to the end of May four districts of the Madras Presidency were affected, Tanjore, Tinnevelly, Trichinopoly and South Arcot. Tanjore registered 1,667 deaths, and the remaining three districts 64 deaths only between them. All the remaining area of the Presidency was absolutely free from cholera. In June four new districts got cholera294 EPIDEMIC CHOLERA OF INDIA OF 1875 AND 1876. [ Section IV. July; and Rajahmundry, 10th July. On 8th July, troops marching to Hyderabad were attack- ed on the banks of the Godavery. In 1818, the advance subsequent to 20th July occupied a definite area on the east coast; Guntoor got its cholera on 30th July, and on 2nd August the northern villages of Nellore were entered. Ongole got its cholera on 14th, the same day on which Dharwar, Hoobly and Badamy in Bombay became affected. And here the cholera of the east coast stopped; and even Nellore, 70 miles to the south, got no cholera before the secondary movement late in Sep- tember. To the north and west of the line there was no limit. From Hyderabad to Bombay, and from Dharwar to Nusseerabad cholera was universal between 20th July and 14th August 1818. When Madras City was occupied in 1818, these were the dates as given by Scot. They in- dicate the covering of a great area in this week295 Chapter IV.] THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE MONSOON CHOLERA OF 1875. The material adapted for invasion is not wanting in these years of exemption; we find cholera in full epidemic vigour in the areas occupied in the spring, and taking up as much of new ground as is permitted to it. The vehicle may be wanting, and without a vehicle cholera does not move; or the body of cholera may already have been diverted elsewhere, and the sweep of the monsoon over a tract from which cholera has been so removed conveys no material for an epidemic to regions beyond. Every epidemic movement during the course of advance lessens the chance of attack in a special locality. In 1869, Meean Meer had not a single cholera admission; and in 1875 an attempt of cholera to establish itself on 20th October was abortive. In my report of 1872 the subject is thus alluded to: "It is more than remarkable to find that in three great epidemics the outbreak at Meean Meer should have commenced almost on the same day, the 7th August in 1856, the 6th August in 1861, and the 5th August in 1872. These facts show that, on empirical grounds alone, the Sanitary Commissioner was warranted in representing to Government, as he did in June 1869, that the occurrence of a single case of cholera in Meean Meer in the last week of July or first week of August, such as occurred this year on 1st August, should be followed by the immediate evacuation of the cantonment." In August 1875, as in August 1869, the Government of India asked my opinion as to the course which the cholera in active progress over Northern India was likely to follow. My note on the subject, handed to Government on 17th August, I shall quote afterwards. The cholera of 1875 failed to strike Meean Meer, and failed to occupy Lahore; this great city registered but 37 deaths in all, and the mortality commenced on 27th August, a date on which a fresh appearance of cholera occurred over a wide tract. But the shadow was not want- ing. On 1st, 3rd, and 4th August, the Civil Surgeon notes the fact that four cases of true cholera did occur in the city, and that a clear interval of 22 days elapsed before the cholera again showed itself. The shadow at Lahore was represented by a substantial movement affecting Amritsar. This cholera began at Amritsar on 21st July, and 800 people died before the close of the epi- demic in October. While Meean Meer to the west escaped, the Umballa cantonment in the east of the Pun- jab became affected on 3rd August, perhaps for the very reason that the cholera which under other conditions would have expended itself 120 miles to the west in the same week was here stopped short in its westward course. The first case in cantonments occurred on 30th July, and the outbreak in the Rifle Brigade, which had 33 cases of cholera, culminated on 5th August. The movement of 20th June, affecting the Himalayas from Kangra to Ghurwal, had ap- propriated much of the material, which, but for this movement, would in August have affected some at least of the districts which I have noted as escaping in 1875. This Himalayan cholera could not make a retrograde movement on the Punjab, and, therefore, it was expended on the districts already occupied. What became of this Punjab cholera of 1875 I shall show in the next Chapter. The homologous phenomenon of the affection of the British Soldier taken as a type, in the Armies of the tree Presidencies. The Umballa outbreak was representative of the vast movement which we have traced from Amritsar to Madras City; the cholera of this week, mov- ing over Madras, Bombay, the Berars, the Central Provinces and Upper India was in homological relation one and the same. We read the fact, even when taking as a type our few Europeans Troops dispersed over the great continent of India. These are the dates of the commencement of outbreaks296 EPIDEMIC CHOLERA OF INDIA OF 1875 AND 1876. [Section IV. districts registered no cholera deaths in November. In December, the total mortality for the province was 58, Raipore giving 34 out of this total. In the Berars, 52 deaths appear in November, and these were confined to two districts; the last occurred on 18th November. No death was registered in December. In Bombay, Dharwar gave 477 out of 819 deaths from the Presidency in December; and in January 1876, the same district gave 640 out of a total of 900. Elsewhere the cholera was dormant or at a minimum. As in 1818, the Madras Presidency shows in its registration an increase, and not a decline, in the last quarter of 1875; and most districts which at this season retained it, carried cholera into and throughout 1876. The deaths of November and December were more numerous than those of any month of 1875, as may be seen by reference to the registration table. The same natural phenomenon is shown in the registration for the same quarter of 1876 when the deaths rose from 3,280 in October to 31,183 in December, an aspect of cholera which leads us back to the facies shown in the home of endemic cholera at sea-level in Eastern Bengal.
Section IV. EPIDEMIC CHOLERA OF INDIA OF 1875 AND 1876. 297 CHAPTER V. LEADING FEATURES OF THE CHOLERA OF 1876. I regard it as most important that this inquiry into the method of which the area embracing the whole of Hindostan is occupied by an invading cholera should be complicated as little as possible by secondary questions. I prefer, therefore, to leave for consideration at some future time the behaviour of cholera in Bombay and Madras in 1876; and all the more that I am as yet unacquainted with more than the outline of its history. The great famine of 1876-77 we know to have been rendered more terrible by the ravages of cholera; and a study of the aspect in which cholera specially manifests itself in a famine- stricken population, where predisposition is so palpable, may do something towards increasing our knowledge of the means by which the diffusion of cholera occurs in other communities. Great development of cholera in the endemic area in the end of 1876. Was there any fresh distribu- tion of cholera over India coincident with this manifestation? But in case the local observers in Southern India should allow the special object of their research to be obscured by the generally prevailing mortality, and should overlook the possibility that, in 1877, they have to deal, not with the cholera of 1875, but with the cholera of a new invasion, I take the opportunity to call attention to certain features in the cholera of 1876 which seem to me to demand notice. The submergence by the cyclone-wave of 31st October, of the great cholera-breeding tract of Eastern Bengal, in the very week when it was prepared to throw off its cholera, made it almost certain that an epidemic would follow over the submerged tract and the adjoining dis- tricts: and these were the deaths registered in the last quarter of 1876: October. November. December. Backergunge, Noakholly, Chittagong and Jes- sore. 514 10,936 31,232 Five districts of Eastern Bengal, affected in a minor degree 1,776 7,622 8,128 Eight districts lying to the north of these. 256 702 1,210 These figures show that little extension took place towards the north. No abnormal in- crease of cholera appeared in Behar, Chota Nagpore, the Sonthal Country or Orissa, at this time; and Calcutta, Nuddea and the districts west of the Hooghly sympathised little with the affected eastern districts. The cholera deaths of the last quarter of 1876 of Bengal Proper, may be tabulated thus:298 EPIDEMIC CHOLERA OF INDIA OF 1875 AND 1876. Section IV. The increase over Madras at this time may have been only that nor- mal for the season, and related to a cholera already present. The north-eastern districts,299 Chapter V.] ASPECTS OF EPIDEMIC CHOLERA IN INDIA IN 1876. 48,000 deaths were registered among the general population within the same area. It is the rule, and not the exception, that when cholera is in movement, its presence is manifested in our types; and we expect to find the manifestation. But in 1876, with the report of the presence of cholera in every district, our types in a great measure failed to show it; and this, because the cholera was localised or limited in its movement. The deaths in the European army of Bengal of 1876 are naturally grouped in two classes. Out of 115 deaths, 80 were caused by the onward movement of cholera towards the frontier; 5 occurred within the endemic area; and the remaining 30 deaths were spread over 10 stations, showing how trifling was the tendency to severe outbreaks with this cholera of the second year. The province of Oudh lost 22,000, and suffered generally, although the chief loss fell on the three districts300 EPIDEMIC CHOLERA OF INDIA OF 1875 AND 1876. [ Section IV. How the anticipations formed were realised. This simple statement was realised in all its leading features. Ferozepore, Meean Meer, and Jullundur absolutely escaped throughout the monsoon season, with this exception, that at Ferozepore three cases of cholera did occur on 23rd, 24th and 26th August, an ex- traordinary fact, when we consider that out of half a million of inhabitants, only one death from cholera was recorded in 1875. The cholera knew its limit behind the Jhelum and kept it; it moved on Cashmere and filled the valley with the material of the epidemic of 1876; on 9th April 1876 we find it in epidemic life beyond the Frontier, in the Bolan Pass and in Candahar; Murree was attacked with the monsoon of 1876; and the Peshawar Valley was entered, and retained its cholera up to the very same week as in 1858 and 1862. These contingencies for 1876 were discussed in detail before leaving India in October 1875; and also with several authorities in England in the spring, before the events of the year had begun to declare themselves. Let me then show what did occur in 1876, and the meaning of the different occurrences. In 1856 and 1861, we had not the deaths of the general population to show us plainly and visibly the geography of the abruptly defined cholera line at the north-western limit. This is supplied in the registration of 1875; and the contrast showing the distribution of the morta- lity in the two years 1875 and 1876 gives the illustration in perfection, and I trust the lesson which it teaches may nevr be forgotten. The limitation in the north-west; the aerial wall which retained the cholera. Illustration of what is meant by an aerial wall. This is what it teaches: The advance of cholera in 1875 up to a certain limit, which was the same reached in 1856 and 1861; the exemption of all dis- tricts to the south, where the six districts bordering on the desert registered in all 5 deaths in 1875; the exemption of every district beyond Gujranwala, 8 deaths being the total for the entire tract beyond; the aborted attempt, clearly enough shadowed out, to revive in the districts west of Delhi in the spring of 1876; the actual commencement of the cholera of 1876 at the aerial wall; the continued exemption in 1876 of the tract to the south exempted in 1875; the occupation of every district from Lahore northwards; and the absolute failure of the cholera to assume a retrograde movement over the districts occupied in 1875, affording a crucial example of the truth, that epidemic cholera in India does not radiate.

302 EPIDEMIC CHOLERA OF INDIA OF 1875 AND 1876. [Section IV Contrast with this statement the registration of 1872 and 1873 in the preceding epidemic In this epidemic, as in 1869, natural influences determined that there should be no aerial wall in the north-west; and, accordingly, the cholera swept the Punjab in the year from Delhi to the frontier. The material was taken up and removed beyond the frontier as completely as if a flight of locusts or of birds, had taken their departure from their resting place of the previous year. In 1873, there was no rise behind an aërial wall, no reappearance of cholera in Lahore, Sialkot and Gujranwala as a base of departure. As in 1876, the seed sown in the canal districts west of Delhi, tried abortively to come forward into life. But the whole of the Punjab failed to register more than 149 deaths in 1873, of which these Delhi districts gave 112. Cholera of the Bolan Pass of 9th April 1876. Probably an invading cholera of November 1875. Whence came the cholera of the spring of the last week of March 1876, which attacked our men with such severity in the Bolan Pass on 9th April? Beyond the Jhelum, only a single cholera death was registered in the first five months of 1876; throughout Scinde not a case of cholera was registered in 1876. The practical mind naturally enquires, if cholera advances by human agency how can we have cholera widely epidemic over Central Asia, which we know to have come from India, when it is certain that there is no con- necting link and a vacant gap many hundreds of miles wide between. In a case like this, no one can assume that a cholera dormant for a long series of years has come to life. New distribution has taken place, whatever be the theory employed to account for the fact. My belief is, that this, which was certainly a cholera of re-vitalisation, was distributed late in 1875. In the very week to which I have so often alluded, and after cholera had died out almost entirely over Northern India, our indices called upon us to recognise that something new was happening. Meean Meer, as I have said, had not a single case of cholera throughout the monsoon season; but on 20th October cholera appeared, and between the 20th and 24th, 7 cases occurred in the European regiment. And this is to be noted, that no such occurrence had happened since Meean Meer was made a cantonment. I have said that the general population of the Ferozepore district registered only one death in 1875, and that, notwithstanding this, our cantonment gave 3 admissions in August. On October 7th, a fourth case showed itself. And then, coincidently with the outbreak at Meean Meer, cholera appeared in the regiment and battery, and among the native population of the Cantonment. In the regiment it appeared on 27th October, among the natives on 1st Novem- ber, and in the battery on 6th November. After the great epidemic of the monsoon season of 1856, a case occurred illustrating the same phenomenon of advance beyond the epidemic limit of the year in Northern India, in the last week of October. In this week a Sikh Regiment, marching from Hazara to Dera Ismael Khan was attacked; and neither before nor after was cholera reported north of the Jhelum. Parallel of the Cashmere cholera of April 1876, invading in the end of 1875. It was probably at this time that movement into Cashmere occurred; and here the cholera was fostered into life very early in the low-lying tracts, cases having appeared even in the last days of December. This cholera lasted throughout 1876 up to October, and the registra- tion by the native authorities gave 5,580 deaths. On 15th April, Major Henderson wrote, reporting that cholera was epidemic in the valley of Cashmere. Up to the 7th, 5 deaths had occurred in Srinagar; and on that day 13 seizures occurred. And beyond the city also cholera was appearing, and 121 deaths had been reported from outlying districts. Major Henderson continues: "It appears to be a bad feature in the present outbreak that the disease has appeared in all parts of the valley almost simultaneously." He adds: "There has been a good deal of rain all over Cashmere till within the last three or four days." Afterwards followed the interval preceding the monsoon burst. Dr. Bellew writes: "In Srinagar it raged till May, when it gradually declined, and it seems to have remained quies- cent during June. In July it burst out fresh, and continued with unabated deadliness up to the middle of October." With the monsoon revitalisation, extension occurred. Dr. Cunningham, of the 15th Sikhs, deputed to Jummoo to assist during the cholera, writes: "The first decided case of cholera occurred on 4th August, and the epidemic reached its maximum about the middle of the month. Previous to this outbreak there was no cholera in the surrounding villages, or on the route between Srinagar and Jummoo. In Jummoo 600 people were attacked. On 23rd August, with a change of wind from east to west, and a change in the atmosphere quite appreciable even at Sialkot, a sudden and great diminution of this cholera of Jummoo took place." The significance of the April cho- lera of the frontier of 1876, illustrat- ed by the epidemic phenomena of April 1875. This movement subsequent to 20th October resulting in re-vitalisation in the first week of April in the year following, I take to be the homologue of the phenomena attending the movement of cholera from the east upon Western India between 20th October and 10th November studied in the previous chapters, which is revitalised before the middle of April. In this light, I reckon that the cholera of Candahar of 9th April, and of Cashmere of 7th April, was the homological equivalent of the cholera of the same day of 1875, amongst the railway labourers at Indore, a true re-vitalisation of a cholera distributed months before.
Chapter V.] ASPECTS OF EPIDEMIC CHOLERA IN INDIA IN 1876. 303 The following is the homologue in one of our types in 1876. From Cawnpore to the frontier one solitary case of cholera showed itself in the spring of 1876, from January to May, in the European Army. Delhi was the locality; the date 10th April. The medical officer says regarding it: "The first point to be specially noted, is the total absence of even a rumour of cholera in the district at the time of the occurrence of this case. The last case happened on the 10th Novem- ber of last year; that case also was a solitary one, a native, who was attacked and died after the fort had been apparently free from cholera since the 10th September 1875. There were no premonitions of any kind, such as general malaise, among the men, nor, so far as is known, were there any unusual or important local sanitary defects likely to prove injurious to the health of the men." Parallel on the frontier in April 1862. It was in this very week of April that cholera first appeared in the Bannu district, beyond the epidemic limit of 1861, heralding the great advance which occurred three months later. The same may be expected in future epidemics, and in this aspect the occurrence is brought about by natural causes and not by chance importation. Advance on Northern India with the monsoon of 1876. The Murree cholera of July. It is, as a rule, with the setting in of the monsoon that cholera appears in the Murree Hills. Murree has suffered in 1858, 1867, 1872 and 1876; and ex- cept in 1857, when two fatal cases were observed on 17th and 28th May, the outbreak has occurred after the middle of June. I believe, however, that here, as elsewhere in the hills, forerun- ners indicative of cholera will, in years like 1858 and 1862 and 1876, be found in May, and early in June; and Dr. Bellew justly regards as cholera a few deaths of May and June 1876, attributed to other causes. Dr. Bellew concludes that "the disease, or its cause, was not imported into Murree, but originated there independently." By this it is meant, I presume, that human agency was not the cause of its introduction. The first cases in Murree occurred on 13th and 15th July; and the depôt was attacked on 24th. The working parties at Camp Gharial were attacked on 8th August. General advance over Northern India in 1876 in the same week in which the general advance over so many tracts of India in 1875 occurred. In Rawalpindi, the same regiment which furnished these parties was attacked on 5th August, the first case in the city having occurred on 27th July. In Hazara, the first case was recorded in 3 circles304 EPIDEMIC CHOLERA OF INDIA OF 1875 AND 1876. [Section IV. that could be spared from Peshawar was marched to Nowshera on 4th August; and with the large detachments at Cherat, the British garrison was reduced to a minimum. Cherat and Nowshera were again remarkable for their immunity from the epidemic, and no cases occurred in either place, notwithstanding the fact that cholera was actually brought into the latter cantonment." Invasion of the Peshawar valley in 1876. Aspect of the invasion. The aspect of cholera in the Peshawar valley in 1876 differed in no respect from that of former years. On 10th August, when the districts lying to the east began to tell that cholera was approaching or had moved upon the tract then occupied, the shadow appeared in the Peshawar cantonment, where a single fatal case was noticed; just as in 1869, when a single case, on 14th August, foretold that cholera might be expected. There is no certainty as to the date at which the Peshawar valley may be entered in the monsoon season: in 1862, it was in the first week of July; in 1869, it was in the first week of September; in 1876, it was on 27th September; and in 1858 and 1872, it was in the first week of October. No credence is therefore to be attached to any statement which professes to predict the date at which Peshawar shall be attacked. As on all other occasions, in 1876 the outburst was simultaneous in the cantonment. In the city a single death was reported on 13th September; and from 16th to 20th September, 17 cases and 8 deaths showed that cholera was existing. In my report of 1869 I have tried to trace the period for which a cholera thus showing its existence, incubates in the valley, before causing a general and simultaneous outbreak. Reckoning the 16th to 20th as the date of appearance, the parallel seems to hold very exactly. A period of eleven or twelve days appears to be normal, and the possibility of employing this previous opportunity in moving out of the valley indicates that this nterval should be recorded in every epidemic, if it should be found. The case is stated thus in my report for 1869: "The first case of cholera recognised in Peshawar city was on 1st September, and on the 13th 92 persons died. "On the 11th September the area of the Peshawar valley occupied by the cantonment was visibly affected, and suddenly on the 18th every corps in cantonment and in camp was struck by cholera. The General Commanding reports: 'It burst as a storm over the station.' I have shown how in Scinde, far to the south, the cholera of the same invasion culminated on the very same day. This is, I think, an instance of what I have described under the figure of the sprouting of the cholera seed, and a parallel to what occurred in the Peshawar valley in the first week of June 1867, following the invasion of 19th May. The cholera of the invasion of the 19th May 1867 descended in force on the city and cantonment and was repro- duced in power in the first week of June; in 1869 cholera descended upon the valley in the first week of September, and, after the same interval as in 1867, there came the sudden and universal onset of the 18th." Following on this shadowed cholera of the 16th September 1876, eleven days later the cantonment was attacked, thus:Chapter V.] ASPECTS OF EPIDEMIC CHOLERA IN INDIA IN 1876. 305 PESHAWAR306 EPIDEMIC CHOLERA OF INDIA OF 1875 AND 1876. [ Section IV. Many stations, however, exhibited this increase of malarious fevers which gave no sign of the presence of cholera. These are the fever admissions of the native troops:307 Chapter V.] ASPECTS OF EPIDEMIC CHOLERA IN INDIA IN 1876. which does not recognise this. All reasoning as to secondary phenomena must follow on the recognition, and this principle will be found lying at the root of the present and all my other reports on cholera. Months and years before cholera reached the north-western frontier in the course of these epidemics, we watched its deliberate advance from Eastern Bengal, noting in each epi- demic the acceleration or retardation of its progress by natural influences; and the aspect under which the appearance occurred on each occasion, forbids me to believe that the material of the outbreak was lying in the Peshawar valley, ready for manifestation with a combination of epidemic conditions hitherto undetermined. Whether cholera has in India a perennial habitat beyond the endemic area can be answered. It is a mere problem in Natural History, capable of solution by the application to the enquiry of appreciable facts.
308 EPIDEMIC CHOLERA OF INDIA OF 1875 AND 1376. [Section IV. CHAPTER VI. GENERAL CONCLUSIONS SUGGESTED BY THE STUDY OF THE CHOLERA OF 1875 AND 1876. Question of the importation of cholera in this epidemic and its spread by human agency. Fifteen districts of the Punjab registered between them 13 deaths in 1875, in a year when cholera was epidemic over half the province, less than one death to each district. It is in an area so divided that the question of the importation of cholera can be fairly worked out. Cholera. is imported and then it spreads, is the assertion; and it is easy, with some show of truth, to assert that cholera has sprung from such a focus when it is seen blazing up subsequent to the arrival of passengers from infected tracts. The assertion really amounts to this: the Punjab is divided into 32 districts; cholera was introduced into 17 of these districts in 1875, and therefore it spread; cholera was not introduced in 15 districts, and therefore did not appear, or if it was introduced influences of which we know nothing stopped its propagation in these districts. Unknown causes prevailing in the one-half of the area, are presumed to influence the human system so that it is capable of receiving cholera, and in the other to act universally as an antidote even to a cholera poison when introduced. This is what is offered as antagonistic to the theory which asserts that cholera is air-borne and is as far- flying as are the limits of natural areas. Primarily, these theories cannot be reconciled; the one or the other is false. If cholera is spread only by the human being, the theory which shows cholera to be air-conveyed is untrue; if cholera is spread solely as an aerial miasm, then the theory which recognises only the effects of human intercourse is unfounded. The most that is admitted by the advocates of the human theory is, that the subjection of cholera to meteorological agencies is absolute, and that these influences can and do operate so as to do away altogether with the effects of the poison, although imported. They do not recognise the entity minus the human being. The antagonistic theory, while holding as opposed to demonstrable fact the statement that cholera moves only by human agency, may, if necessary, be extended in its scope so as to em- brace the other; that is to say, the enquiry is left open as to whether or not the cholera entity, after being aerially distributed, may be subsequently propagated or spread by man. In the theory which connects cholera solely with man there is no such extensibility. Human intercourse must explain every fact of spread and propagation, and nothing is left to the play of natural agencies. Human intercourse, giving the widest scope to the signification of the term, cannot pretend to account for any fundamental phenomenon displayed during the progress of epidemic cholera; and, therefore, I assert the theory to be radically untrue as applied to the behaviour of cholera in India. I do not say that the above statement will hold true all over the world; and, even as applied to India, the theory does not preclude the possibility that cholera may be conveyed by the human being. Naturally, the recoil is to the opposite extreme. The bold statement that cholera is never spread over an area unless human agency intervene, is apt to be met by the equally dogmatic statement that cholera is as pure a miasm as malaria, and as little amenable to the control of man. Such a history as that which I have been writing, gives great scope for such dogmatism, and it should be our earnest endeavour to throw into the scale against it whatever may be advanced as proving incontestably that man can and does disseminate and propagate cholera. The effects of sanitary conditions as influencing the propagation of cholera. I should leave a very false impression on the reader were it to be inferred that I under- rated the influence of sanitation in arresting the progress of cholera in communities, or making its effects less felt. The same causes which have reduced the general death- rate have equally influenced the cholera-rate. The fact may be appreciated from these statements:Chapter VI.] CONCLUSIONS SUGGESTED BY THE STUDY OF THE CHOLERA OF 1875-76. 309 Central Jails of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh,1867-76.

It is very certain that prison communities, shut up daily at sunset, enjoy a most remarkable immunity from cholera as well as from malarious fevers, probably due to this very cause. But yet, again, how shall we, on these grounds merely, reconcile these results with the experience of the previous decade? Against these 57 deaths, 1,147 deaths from cholera appear in the records of the same seven jails in the ten years preceding.

North of Benares there was in the mutiny year no prison population which furnished returns; and substituting the mortality of 1856 for that of 1857, we find that this year gave 449 deaths in six jails occupied. Such a statement should make us pause and reflect, that, while it is right and legitimate to contend that the theoretical history of cholera shall be fought out on its scientific merits, the vitally important question for the study of the sanitary officer is, what is meant by the localisation of cholera, not geographically, but in communities; why, for example, these jail communities localised the cholera of the epidemics of 1856, 1859, 1861, 1863, and failed to localise those of 1867, 1869, 1872 and 1875. Taking this case as it stands, it would seem that conditions brought into existence since 1863 have saved nearly 1,550 lives in these seven jails alone, and that a return to the conditions previously existing would be again attended with a corresponding mortality. One series of propositions seems clear and demonstrable: cholera in India occupies vast areas in successive epidemic leaps, and many communities are simultaneously attacked: cholera in India does not overstep epidemic limits: knowing beforehand that certain tracts fail to localise cholera, we can in such cases place our troops so as to ensure their immunity when epidemic advance does occur: local conditions cannot prolong beyond the period for which it is created the cholera of any general or local manifestation: enquiry into individual outbreaks fails to show that cholera is imported: those brought in contact with patients suffering from cholera are not attacked in appreciably greater numbers than those around them, and in all Indian epi- demics the exemption of medical officers from the attack of cholera has been an observed fact. Taking all this for granted, we have still to account for the striking disparity which would seem to be attributable to local influences for evil. Defect of sanitary arrangements in the eleven years preceding 1867, may in the case of these jails have implied such insanitary conditions as these: overcrowding and allowing a foul, stagnant and moisture-laden air to accumulate over the sleeping prisoners; a system of con- servancy which did not recognise the danger of the growth and spread of cholera when once introduced; a neglected water-supply, selected for its temporary habitat by a cholera air-borne or propagated in the human being within the jail walls; or the absence of quarantine, which allowed infected individuals or gangs to mix unrestrained with the other prisoners. We do not yet know the whole truth regarding the propagation of cholera in communities; and we have not as yet marked down the special point to be attacked. We know the outworks; that much can be done has been made evident, and much has been done. Removal from a locality likely to be infected has already proved successful, and the advance and behaviour of cholera being now intelligently apprehended, it will do more in the future; and such histories as are attached to the occupation of Cherat and Nowshera, from scientific as well as empirical motives, show that something has been attained, and make brighter a prospect that at first sight seemed very dark. Results of investigations regarding the importation of cholera in 1875. The Sanitary Commissioner with the Government of India has investigated the facts in 67 communities affected by cholera in 1875, and he comes to the conclusion, that in no case was there evidence of the importa- tion of the cholera, or of attack due to communication with the sick. Such investigations as those of the Sanitary Commissioner in the epidemics of 1872 and 1875 tend to show this, if nothing more, that in communities which we can observe and in which there is every opportunity of knowing the actual facts, there is little, if any, tendency of the disease which we call cholera, and which we assert primarily to show the effects on the system of an air-borne miasm, to spread from one man to another by mere contact. On a wider scale and equally appreciable, is the fact here illustrated, that a non-invaded area remains free from cholera, the miasm, which we assert to be air-borne, refusing to be introduced into new tracts by human agency, or to overstep by a mile the limits prescribed to the invading epidemic by natural agencies. 4 F
310 EPIDEMIC CHOLERA OF INDIA OF 1875 AND 1876. [Section IV. In the cholera history of the province, which we have been studying as typical, we find counterstatements made such as the following: Inadequate theory is always apt to lead on to erroneous deduction. The Hurdwar pilgrims carried cholera into Mooltan in 1867; and the circumstance that Mooltan has become a great railway terminus is certain to destroy the known immunity which Mooltan has enjoyed for half a century. The answer is, that from January 1868 to December 1875, a period of eight years, out of a population exceeding one million in Mooltan, Mozuffergarh, and Dera Ghazi Khan, the districts reached by the railway communications, 17 deaths from cholera were registered, the Punjab having been invaded by epidemic cholera in 1869, 1872 and 1875. In the epidemic of 1869 cholera became localised in Amritsar, and 3,041 people died in the city; the entire Lahore district in the same period registered under 300 deaths. Panic suggested that here were evident local conditions, such as would cause Amritsar to become a local centre from which cholera would in the future radiate by human agency. In the immediately suc- ceeding epidemic of 1872, Amritsar City registered 7 cholera deaths out of a population of 134,000. In 1867, the Meean Meer cantonment suffered heavily; in the great epidemic of 1869 it escaped altogether. The inference was made, that the water-supply had been so secured from contamination that the outbreak of cholera in the future was not to be dreaded. The very next epidemic of 1872 swept down on the cantonment, and 185 cases occurred in a strength of 1,300, of which 123 were fatal. In the epidemic of 1869, the Lahore Lunatic Asylum lost 33 out of a strength of 200 inmates. No other community at Lahore suffered in any such ratio. The conclusion arrived at was, that the sand through which the drinking-water of the lunatics passed had been impregnated with cholera evacuations. Among the very first to suffer in the epidemic of 1872 were these same lunatics. Out of a strength of 273, 39 were attacked and 25 died. None of the attendants on the sick were attacked. In the epidemic of 1875 the city of Lahore registered 37 deaths from cholera in all. Out of a strength of 275 lunatics in the asylum, there were 27 cases and 19 deaths. Out of 27 keepers, none were attacked. It is not likely that the contingency of sand-poisoning should have occurred in three successive epidemics; and the Sanitary Commissioner for the Punjab does not urge this theory in writing of the outbreak of 1875. It is not expedient to continue these illustrations, or else I might refer to the experience of Simla in 1875, and many other examples, to show how vain is prediction based on inade- quate theory, and how sanitary effects, good and laudable in themselves, may avail but little when the one proposition is overlooked, that in dealing with a moving cholera, sanitation must be directed against the inevitable. Sound theory must be superadded to the highest local efforts. It is however essential that I should not allow to pass without notice the remarks which Dr. DeRenzy has thought it necessary to introduce as a preamble to his "Report on the Punjab Cholera of 1875." These show a steady persistence in denying what I deem it of prime importance to promulgate. Dr. DeRenzy writes: "In former days it was not at all uncommon to hear of cholera unexpectedly sweeping down on places with the swiftness of a hurricane, and causing all at once wide-spread mortality. There were no such cases in the late epidemic, the reason being, I imagine, because the pro- gress of the disease is now more correctly traced and recorded, and the early beginnings of epidemics, which in former days were entirely overlooked, are now at once brought to notice. Cholera is now seen to resemble other communicable diseases in beginning its career in a place on a very small scale, and then extending the sphere of its operations slowly or rapidly according to the facilities afforded to it for diffusion, and, after attaining its climax of develop- ment like other communicable diseases, from some unknown cause it languishes and dies. It will be seen at a glance that there was no wave-like progress of the disease, no simultaneous advance, climax and retreat. Cholera in the Punjab is essentially a disease of the hot weather, and the months of August and September are the periods when it thrives best; but so far as the history of the last four epidemics shows, it never evinces that steady progress in a particular direction that has been ascribed to it." In these sentences two distinct things are mixed upChapter IV.] CONCLUSIONS SUGGESTED BY THE STUDY OF THE CHOLERA OF 1875-76. 311 It is quite possible that the aspect of cholera is double; one aspect pre- dominating in India, and the other in countries beyond Hindostan. As seen by different observers and in other countries, cholera may present an aspect very different from that familiar to us in India, and while this is not recognised, the field remains open for controversy which is not legitimate, and which must necessarily be unending. When occurring in Russia, Germany, or America, cholera is represented to us as a typhus, propagated by contagion and directly communicated from those already affected; and we are asked to shape our conception of cholera as an epidemic to the facts observed out of India. Cholera, which in India cannot prolong its existence for a week beyond the date at which it is due to die, is represented as regardless of meteorological phe- nomena, a circumstance possibly consistent with its natural history as a typhus, but which. withdraws it from the category of malarious diseases. If there be these two aspects of cholera, criticism which does not admit the possibility is likely to be unsatisfactory. I do not reply to such observation that, being inconsistent with observed facts in this country, it is necessarily erroneous. No one has a right to deny, unless for good and sound reasons, the conclusions of a careful and truthful observer; and, therefore, on purely scientific grounds, I do not dissent from the proposition that epidemic cholera may be due to a malarious miasm in India, while beyond India it may from time to time be propagated as a typhus,*or as a disease with some such natural alliance. The failure to recognise this was probably the cause which led Copland to speak in terms of disparagement of Jameson's conclusions, although based upon facts every one of which can be verified at the present day. It is very interesting to find Copland writing of cholera under two distinct heads312 EPIDEMIC CHOLERA OF INDIA OF 1875 AND 1876. [Section IV. cholera patients, which was accidentally left in a bed-room. If the shield have these two aspects,Chapter IV.] CONCLUSIONS SUGGESTED BY THE STUDY OF THE CHOLERA OF 1875-76. 313 smaller towns and villages. It is to be feared that before this reaches you it will have escaped the boundaries of this province, and then no one can predict its future course." The Lancet of 14th August also states that, by accounts just received, cholera is fearfully prevalent in Damascus, as many as 400 cases a day being reported. On 8th December the possible origin of this cholera was discussed by the Epidemiological Society of London, but with no result. CONCLUSION. This is the story which the cholera of 1875 tells for itself. It is written by the finger of nature, and her finger is not guided nor controlled by the opinion of any individual. Nature writes for every observer, and he who chooses to study what is thus written will not finally err. The Statistical Officer is responsible to every local observer who contributes to his totals and his generalisations. I accept the responsibility for errors, and I make no profession that my generalisations are beyond dispute. I thoroughly recognise that they are subject to modification with further expe- rience. Any one who knows my work personally is aware that I am so far above prejudice in this matter, and that I should not hesitate to demolish the structure which I have built, and reconstruct anew upon a healthier theory, the vast accumulation of truths which now stand recorded, and which I have tried to make common property. To any one who for a love of the truth suggests the possible error arising from defective registration, I answer, that our well-observed types and our imperfect general registration are sufficient to show and prove satisfactorily what will be more perfectly exhibited as the defects in registration are amended. The aggregate of the facts of 1875-76, here given, is the aggregate as far as I know it. To me, claiming to be a competent observer, it appeals as a harmony; and it is, I believe, competent to any one with these facts before him to come to the same conclusion. What he will accept or what lie will refuse, each individual must, however, choose for himself, and be guided by his own capacity; and for myself, I assert no infallibility as far as the interpretation of facts goes. I must repeat once more, that to discriminate what are the primary truths regarding epidemic cholera and what are secondary, is essential to the study of the natural history of cholera. A writer professing to ignore this distinction, and to criticise my writings without a distinct recognition of this truth, might as well leave his task alone. All must end in a mere see-saw of asseveration and denial, and will profit nothing towards a consistent narrative or a finished study. What such critics reckon to be the whole truth, I take to be much less than the half, as applied to Indian cholera; for I can, if necessary, consistently incorporate in my system all that is insisted on, and still leave intact the whole series of propositions which go to demonstrate the primary truths: the reverse has no such resource. Once acknowledge as true that cholera has no existence except in relation to man, and the natural history of cholera in India is an untruth; and this no one now-a-days will assert who is acquainted with the facts. Into this study nature will intrude, however roughly she may be pitchforked aside. I have written to little purpose, if it be deemed a sufficient answer to the great generalisations set forth in this paper, that a gang of prisoners of the Central Jail at Poona were poisoned by drinking impure water. However true and important in its practical bearing may be the state- ment that cholera may be propagated and diffused in water, the alleged fact is secondary, and it does not fall into the natural class of primary truths. It has been necessary for me all through these reports to illustrate the truth that cholera in India is a moisture-loving miasm; and my prejudices are naturally in favour of the doctrine which holds that cholera may be propa- gated in water and subsequently diffused throughout a community in the same vehicle. But the deduction speciously drawn from the illustration, that wherever exhaustive enquiry has been made in India the results have been the same as obtained in England, is untenable; for, admitting the illustration in question to be proved, the far broader truth comes in to outweigh the significance of the deduction, the truth that no aggregate of outbreaks is the equivalent of an epidemic of cholera in India. Over and over again we have heard, that, were the history of the epidemic of 1818 to be written in the light thrown upon cholera by research in Europe and America as well as India, the account would be very different from that given by Scot or Jameson. The facts of 1875 we know to be facts. Not less true were Scot's delineations of 1818. The facts are visibly and conspicuously true to any naturalist, looking at their mere aspect; and I did not hesitate in Scot's defence to repudiate the suggestion that Scot's dates did not represent the whole truth. The exact facts of 1818 repeated themselves in 1875, and the coincidence was allowed to pass without notice. A reviewer has remarked, and with reason, that a woven web, such as that which I have constructed in my various reports on cholera, implies the expression of the grandest scientific truths, or else a wonderful skill in pleading for what is false. I accept the alternative. I can make no statement which implies a higher scientific standard than that which I have made many times before, and offered for acceptance. It is this, that every epidemic manifest- ation, every outbreak, and every case of cholera to be met with in India, shall take its place in a system314 EPIDEMIC CHOLERA OP INDIA OF 1875 AND 1876. [Section IV. word, the experience of every month and every week and every year, is called on to confirm or refute the theory thus enunciated. And when I state that what is recorded year by year is appreciably true, every scientific observer throughout India has the right to come forward and say that such generalisations are contrary to the facts observed, if such be the case, or that the facts as they stand admit of an interpretation different from that which I have placed upon them. Every page in this Report tells how essential for the direction of practical sanitary mea- sures is a system of statistics such as that which I have tried to shape out from the medical history of the past twenty years. Statistics are the Sibylline Books of modern times; and when they are the outcome of a true registration, when they are deduced from an adequate aggreate, arranged in a natural order, and grouped in accordance with their real significance they are an unerring guide for the future. The constitution of such a system is permanent. It may be susceptible of improvement in many ways; but as the structure grows year by year the tendency is to solidity and perfection.
POSTSCRIPT. RENEWED MOVEMENT OF EPIDEMIC CHOLERA IN 1877-78. The issue of this Report having been unavoidably delayed, I am enabled once again to illustrate the phenomenon of the diffusion of Cholera in the third quarter of the year, its repression and its reappearance in spring over an extensive and defined area. Since the close of the monsoon season of 1877, we have been anxiously watching the progress of a cholera which began to move in the first week of October. Cholera indicated its presence south of the Jumna as early as April, and culminated in July in Banda, Jalaon, and Hamirpur, the districts to which I have so many times referred as affording the evidence that invading cholera has moved westward out of the Gangetic tract. But I am not prepared to say that this was the same cholera which moved on Central and Western India in October; previous history would suggest, that direct invasion from Lower Bengal may have occurred at the date when general movement was observed. There is nothing in the cholera registration of Upper India of the first nine months of 1877 to indicate the progress of a serious epidemic. The registration of Oudh and the North- Western Provinces has a very normal facies; and as regards the tract west of 80° East Longitude, we may make the broad assertion that epidemic cholera had no existence before October, and that then it was confined to the Agra and Muttra districts.

The 31 deaths of the Punjab of 1877, may, probably without exception, be put down to error in registration; and it is specially to be noted, that in the fourth quarter, when cholera covered so extensive a tract, three deaths only were registered in the province. As in October 1874, Lullutpore was the first district that showed to us the new movement of October 1877; and Agra, Muttra, and Gwalior were simultaneously affected. Jhansi did not register a single cholera death from October to December; which shows that importation, which was supposed to have carried the cholera from Lullutpore to Malwa and through Saugor into the Nerbudda valley, had really no influence on the movement. Nor was this cholera conveyed into the districts north of the Jumma. For from October to December, Etah, Etawah, Allyghur, Mynpoorie, Meerut, Bolundshahr, Saharunpore, Mozuffernuggur and Dehra returned for the entire area only three deaths which were attributed to cholera. Even at the time of movement it was evident that a geographical line drawn from the Jumna westward to Western Malwa, was not transgressed; and I had no difficulty in identifying this as a natural line parallel to that delineated on our map of 1868, and which has limited many other epidemic movements, such as those of 1863-64 or 1859-60. As I write nearly eight months after the occurrence, cholera has not yet appeared in any district to the north of this line, which may possibly mean that, as in 1863, the cholera in motion was diverted as a body to the south and west. In 1864, a deadly cholera year in the west and south, Upper India entirely escaped; but should Northern India again suffer later on in 1878, we shall at least have evidence of further movement antecedent to or accompanying the manifestation. The enormous extent of the geographical area first affected in October, may be judged of from these cases which appeared among our troops at a season when cholera has scarcely the power to assert its existence. I refer now to the Bengal Presidency only; but, in geographi- cal continuation, the Panch Mahal, Kaira and Ahmedabad districts of Bombay simultaneously exhibited the invasion of epidemic cholera: Agra, October 3rd, 5th, 6th, and 25th. Four fatal cases in 4316 EPIDEMIC CHOLERA OF INDIA OF 1875 AND 1876, [ Section IV. On 23rd November, a woman of the Battery at Neemuch died, and shortly afterwards a severe outbreak occurred among the labourers employed in constructing the railway near Neemuch. In Western Malwa, the escort of the Political Agent was attacked while marching, and 5 cases occurred from 8th to 11th December. This case recalls the attack of the Governor General's escort in Rajpootana in December 1860. On 12th, 14th, and 15th December, three fatal cases in men belonging to Her Majesty's 2-12th, 34th, and 70th Regiments, occurred on the line of railway between Jubbulpore and Bombay, showing that the Nerbudda valley was affected. It was at this time that cholera broke out in Arabia, and the coincidence is worthy of record. The same occurred early in 1856, in anticipation of the great cholera of India of that year. In the spring of 1878, this cholera has re-appeared over this natural area, earlier or later according to the local conditions afforded; for example, in March in Malwa, and in May at Gwalior. On 2nd and 3rd May a mother and child died in the Fort at Agra, and on the same day cholera was reported in the Lushkur at Gwalior. This is the homologue of the appearance of cholera on 4th May in 1875, illustrated in the second chapter of the cholera section of this report. In 1869, cholera broke out virulently on 22nd April at Morar. In this year, the first case appeared on 7th May, and up to date upwards of 30 European soldiers have died. And one of the most fatal outbreaks recorded of late years which has just ceased, has caused 55 deaths, out of 113 cases of cholera in a treasure escort of Native troops, 379 strong, on the road between Agra and Gwalior, which was attacked on the evening of the 12th May. In Jhansi, Bundelkhund, and Rewah, which lie to the east of the epidemic tract, no cholera is reported; and, as I have already said, no cholera has yet appeared to the north of the epidemic line. In the west, the same cholera appeared six weeks earlier. Malwa, Dhar, Mundesore, Rutlam, Oojein, and Indore were affected in March; and at Bhilsa, in the Bhopal territory, a localised outbreak caused 64 deaths in March. In the last week of March, the camp followers of the 3rd Hussars, stationed at Mhow, were attacked; and out of a strength of 700, 70 were seized and 35 died. At Sehore, the first death was reported on 29th March, and a man of the Bhopal Battalion was attacked on 31st. From west to east there has been no movement of cholera, as the consecutive appearance of the outbreaks of 1878 might suggest. The present is merely an illustration, in a different aspect, of what I have so often urged, that the appearance of cholera in Nimar or Khandeish, a month before its appearance in Malwa, does not imply the conveyance of the cholera from the one district to the other.
