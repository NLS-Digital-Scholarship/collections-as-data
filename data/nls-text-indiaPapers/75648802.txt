Below Annual Administration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Sind, for the year 1940-41. No. 5665/G.IV-3 of 1941-42. Office of the Director of Veterinary Services, Sind. Karachi, dated 19th September 1941. Forwarded, with compliments, to the Secretary to Government of Sind, Revenue Department. 2. There was a sharp decline in mortality of all the important contagious and parasitic diseases, 6,637 animals dying as com- pared to 18,551 in 1939-40. 3. Two Itinerating Veterinary Dispensaries were opened by Government, one at Nasirabad and the other at Mirpur Sakro. A permanent dispensary was opened by the Thar Parkar District Local Board at Digri in charge of their own Veterinary Assistant Surgeon. The number of cases treated at the dispensaries during the year decreased from 46,768 in 1939-40 to 41,645. This is accounted for by the reduction in the number of cases of Liver Fluke owing to a shortage of Carbon Tetrachloride used in the treatment of this disease. This also accounts primarily for the big decrease in the number of animals treated on tour, which declined from 2,05,255 to 69,145. Another factor was the severe tamine conditions in Thar Parkar resulting to the death and mig- ration of many thousands of animals. The number of castrations was 4,631 as compared with 3,870 last year. 4. The District Local Board, Upper Sind Frontier, held their Horse Show at Jacobabad and Government as usual con- tributed Rs. 500 and a sliver medal and a cash contribution of Rs. 500 was also made by the Karachi Race and Riding Club, Limited. 5. Horse Breeding.2 now only two Stallions, one at Jacobabad and the other at Dadu. The District Local Board, Jacobabad, have intimated that they are unable to provide funds for the purchase of additional Stallions. 6. The expenditure of the department in 1940-41 was Rs. 1,53,041 as against Rs. 1,69,168 in the previous year. 7. General.3 Annual Administration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Sind, for the year 1940-41. GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. Mr. J. H. G. Jerrom, M.R.C.V.S., I.V.S., held the post of Director of Veterinary Services, Sind, throughout the year. He toured in each district and inspected most of the Veterinary dispensaries. He also inspected the Stallions maintained by the District Local Boards and Stud Bulls belonging to Government and Local Bodies wherever opportunities occurred. He acted as Judge at the Jacobabad Horse and Cattle Shows. He also supervised the work of the Civil Veterinary Department, in Ajmer- Merwara in addition to his own duties. He attended the meeting of the Animal Husbandry Wing of the Board of Agriculture, Imperial Council of Agricultural Research at Izatnagar in Novem- ber 1940. Mr. Jerrom toured in Sind for 92 days and travelled 1,446 miles by rail and 143 by road, in addition to journeys to Ajmer- Merwara and Izatnagar which covered 13 days, 3,126 miles by rail and 128 miles by road. 2. The post of Officer in-charge, Goat Virus Producing Station, Karachi, was held by Mr. C. S. G. Haji upto 6th March 1941 and on his superannuation, by Mr. Abdul Majid from 7th March to 31st March 1941. The Goat Virus Producing Station continued to work efficiently and provided vaccine whenever required. 3. Mr. H. S. Bawa, M.R.C.V.S., continued to hold the post of Veterinary Investigation Officer, Sind and Ajmer-Merwara. He was on tour in Sind for 110 days, travelling 6,102 miles by rail and 721 miles by road as compared with 108 days, 5,139 miles by rail and 1,189 miles by road travelled in 1939-40. His work is shown below in para. 42. I.4 II.5 13. Haemorrhagic Septicaemia.6 23. Pleuro Pneumonia.7 (e) Fowls. 33. Spirochaetosis.8 villages visited, 2,05,255 cases treated for contagious and parasitic diseases, 4,114 for non-contagious diseases and 1,629 animals castrated in the preceding year. The decrease in the number of cases treated for contagious and parasitic diseases and number of villages visited was due to less reporting of outbreaks of Liver- Fluke Disease in 1940-11, as Carbon Tetrachloride for the treatment of this disease was not available for part of the year. (vi) Investigation. 41. 311 specimens submitted by the subordinate staff from cases of Surra, Piroplasmosis, Anthrax, Haemorrhagic Septicaemia and Liver-Fluke and other parasitic diseases were examined and 153 of these were positive of 2 brains of dogs sent to Haffkine Institute, Bombay, both were declared positive for Rabies. 42. The Veterinary Investigation Officer, Sind and Ajmer- Merwara, continued his work of his investigation of the several diseases viz., Wah, Contagious, Pleuro Pneumonia, Contagious Mastitis, Rinderpest, Contagious Abortion, Plant Poisoning, Encephalomyelitis. The usual detailed annual report of this officers' work and its summary have been submitted to Govern- ment of Sind and to the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research, New Delhi.

He inspected all Veterinary Dispensaries, visited Government Agri- cultural and Cattle Breeding farms and Gaushalas and inspected Government Stud Bulls when required. 52. Eight Veterinary Field Compounders continued to work. Of these, two were temporarily placed in charge of Itinerating Veterinary Dispensaries and six worked under Veterinary Assistant Surgeons. As in the previous years they attended outbreaks of Liver-Fluke, Parasitic Gastritis, Foot and Mouth, Mange, etc. treated simple cases and carried out castration by the Burdizzo method. It is considered that an increase in the number of this cadre will be most useful in making Veterinary Aid more promptly available in rural areas. 53. The clerical staff performed their duties efficiently during the year under report. V 11 TABLE I.
