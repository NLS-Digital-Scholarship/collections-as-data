ANNUAL REPORT ON THE Working of the Ranchi Indian Mental Hospital, Kanke in Bihar and Orissa for the year 1930 [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] SUPERINTENDENT, GOVERNMENT PRINTING, BIHAR AND ORISSA, PATNA, 1932.
Priced Publications of the Government of Bihar and Orissa can be had fromNo. 10482/HANNUAL REPORT ON THE Working of the Ranchi Indian Mental Hospital, Kanke in Bihar and Orissa for the year 1930. 1. Administration.2 causes and steps proposed to be taken have been fully dealt with in the last Triennial Report (19273 5. The maximum number resident in the hospital on any one night was 1,264 (1,049 males and 215 females) against 1,274 (1,065 males and 209 females) in the previous year. 6. Total admission.4 The distribution of periods of hospital life of patients discharged during the year under review are shown in the following table :5 12. The chief causes of death among patients resident in the hospital during the year under report are shown in the following table :6 13. The general health of the patients was good throughout the period under report. The daily average number of sick treated in the infirmaries for bodily ailments was 59.93 males, 1.67 females and 61.60 total against 53.95 males, 3.47 females total 57.42 in the previous year. The important admissions to the infirmaries during the period under report are shown in the following table :7 15. Statement no. II.8 19. Statement no. VI shows the types of insanity of the patients admitted during the year under report. Mania, melancholia, dementia præcox, toxic insanity and confu- sional insanity were the principal types treated. 20. Paying patients.9 24. Sanitation.10 section was considerably expanded during the year under report but the progress was hampered for want of a weaving instruc- tress, the post of which was sanctioned by Government but no appointment was made for want of funds. The vegetable garden of this hospital is entirely run by the patients' labour and the hospital is entirely self-supporting as regards its vegetable and fruit supply. The following table shows the total income derived from the garden during the year under report, and in the previous two years :11 (iv) Drugs.12 (b) Similarly, Dr. P. C. Das, M.B., who is happily also an eye specialist, did excellent work with ophthalmoscope and operated on some cases of cataract among the patients, (c) Syphilis.13 We rarely see such early cases admitted into this hospital. We are only called upon to treat all chronic cases whose relations and friends have kept them in their homes for years under treatment of every one but a psychiatrist, and are only sent to us when they become unmanageable and dangerous at home. This is further aggravated by the present unavoidable congestion of the hospital with the result that cases are allowed to remain in jails or houses untreated until such time accommoda- tion is available. In spite of all these difficulties I am happy to be able to report that our percentage of cure to so-called " new admission " as well as to average strength of the total population, can proudly be looked upon as extremely reasonable and good. I tender my best thanks to Rev. A. C. Chatterji, the Church of England Chaplain, who was kind enough to give religious suggestions to my above stated patient of conversion hysteria. 26. (x) Sports and Amusements.14 organised a couple of years ago played both Indian and English music throughout the year and afforded another source of great pleasure to patients. Its existence and the maintenance of the high standard of music are entirely due to the enthusiasm and perseverance of Sub-Assistant Surgeon Dr. Dhaniraj Choudhury. The band also played at patients' " games " and theatricals. A few musical instruments were purchased during the year. My best thanks are due to all those kind ladies and gentle- men of Ranchi who often graced the social functions of this hospital by their presence and I assure them that the patients very much enjoy their visits on such occasions and often look forward to it.

Das shouldered the heavy responsibilities of the post with commendable zeal, energy and ability to the entire satisfaction of all concerned. Dr. Das was ably and loyally assisted by all the staff during his tenure of office. I have very little to add about the conduct of the staff to what it was my pleasure to record in my last annual report of 1928. However, I would like to record my deep appreciation of the work of all staff who so ably and loyally helped me in the administration of this large hospital during the period under review. 31. General.18 The tenure of three years' appointment of the members appointed in 1927 being over, the following new members were appointed by the Governments of Bengal and Bihar and Orissa:19 The medical and nursing staff of this hospital were also allowed to attend these lectures and demonstrations. 36. Certification.20 various forms of child guidance organisations and associated nursery schools and also psychiatric work in connection with juveniles courts. I was thoroughly impressed with all that I saw in America. No country in the world has made such rapid progress in mental science as America, and no doubt a visit to this country would add considerably to one's knowledge in psychiatry and other allied branches of mental science. I was selected by the Secretary of State for India to attend as India's delegate the First International Congress on Mental Hygiene which was held at Washington on 5th May 1930. This was my second visit to America. The First World Congress on Mental Hygiene was indeed an epochal event. More than 3,500 persons attended the Congress with 53 countries and all the six continents represented. The Congress enabled me to come into contact with the world's celebrities in the field of psychological medicine and I am highly indebted to the Government of India for giving me such a unique opportunity to attend this epochal event and also to the local Government for having spared my services on deputation to this country.

Priced Publications of the Government of Bihar and Orissa can be had fromNo. 10466/ H-199-1932 FROM COL. L. COOK, C.I.E., M.B., B.S., F.R.C.S., I.M.S., INSPECTOR-GENERAL OF CIVIL HOSPITALS, BIHAR AND ORISSA, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BIHAR AND ORISSA, LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT. Dated Patna, the 17th August 1932. SUBJECT.ANNUAL REPORT ON THE Working of the Ranchi Indian Mental Hospital, Kanke, in Bihar and Orissa for the year 1931. 1. Administration.2 As in the previous years special efforts were made with the help of the Magistrates and Police throughout the year under report to discharge incurable harmless insane patients to the care of their relatives, as a result of which 8 patients were discharged. No trace of any friend or relative could be found in 7 cases in spite of vigorous enquiries instituted by the Magistrates con- cerned. In 8 cases the plea of inability on economic grounds to take charge of the patients put forward by the relatives was accepted by the enquiring Magistrates. 5. The maximum number of patients resident in the hospital on any one night during the year under report was 1,280 (1,051 males and 229 females) against 1,264 (1,049 males and 215 females) in the previous year, 6. Total admissions.3 During the year under review the ratio per cent of cases cured to daily average strength was practically the same as in 1930. During the year under report we had 132 admissions as compared with 99 in 1930 and 93 in 1929, The total discharges were 87 in 1931 as compared with 81 in 1930 and 78 in 1929. In spite of this progressive increase in discharges our ratio per cent of cures to total admissions is low compared to 1930 and 1929. This is due to the fact that during the year under report we had a large number of admissions (132) and majority of them were chronic insanes who had been kept for a considerable time either at their homes or in jails for want of accommodation in this hospital. One, therefore, cannot expect cures from such chronic cases within a year, hence the low percentage of cures to total admissions. 11.

Health of patients .7 Approximately 9,347 cases were treated as outdoor patients for minor ailments such as ulcers, slight injuries, headaches, constipation, etc. 16. Cases under observation.8 from the figures given below that the largest number of patients admitted every year was between the ages of 20 to 40. The ages between 40 to 60 claim the next place in order of frequency :9 23. Paying patients.10 to eradicate totally the breeding places of these mosquitos. However, we are doing our best to keep the mosquito nuisance away from the hospital as much as possible. The '' Thresh disinfector " machine worked efficiently in disinfecting patients' clothing and bedding throughout the year under report. 29. Treatment of mental conditions.11 The percentage of partients to daily average strength use- fully employed on various works of the hospital during the year under report was 67.35 males and 59.18 females. (iv) Drugs.12 (2) Bacteriophage.13 teeth as well as attention to oral hygiene were carried out by the medical staff in cases of few non-paying patients.

The construction of four wells in the vegetable garden for the purpose of irrigation, as reported last year, are now nearing completion. 33. Finance.18 The progressive increase in the receipt is due to the larger amount of fees realized from paying patients. (b) Expenditure.19 The scheme for the matron and nurses, quarters, although administratively approved and considered as important, could not be taken up during the year owing to financial stringency.

The average number of criminal insanes in this institution for the years 1930, 1931 and 1932 were respectively 484, 467 and 468, and during these three years the average number of criminals certified as insane to be detained in the jails of the two provinces wasiii the absence of proper care, treatment and supervision of people suffering from mental defects in these two provinces is leading to any serious mental deterioration of the people. 10. The problem is one which has hitherto affected a people the majority of whom live under primitive conditions, but with the advent of education amongst the masses, the conditions visualised by the Superintendent, viz., an accelerated tempo of living, may be productive eventually of greater mental strain and an increase of mental disorders. 11. Whether this epoch is advancing slowly or rapidly, the effective repercussions of the administration to meet such a situa- tion will, as at present, depend on financial considerations. 12. The question to be decided is whether India should follow the policy of other countries and erect more mental hospitals or the alternative policy of allowing the care of the mental cases to devolve upon the. communities where they reside. It is again the problem of decentralisation and whether it is wise to develop the Policy of Self Help Associations at the periphery, rather than attempt to overcome a complicated and enormous problem by central organisations. One cannot visualise a mental hospital being erected in every district in a province, similar to the county asylums in England, and the alternative method would appear to be one for serious consideration. This alternative method implies that the care of the mental cases should be the responsibility of the community in which they liveiv and the institution of mental clinics in all large hospitals is a necessary preliminary to the decentralisation method of treatment of mental patients. 15. The present advance to reorientate the views of the medical profession on disease with the modern methods of psychological work is one of great importance in the treatment of mental con- ditions in the early stages, and is obviously an endeavour to prevent complete breakdowns ; and this preventive work is the responsibility not of the mental expert, but of the general practitioner. 16. How many persons of unsound mind there are at present in the two provinces is one for conjecture. According to the last Census return, 1931 the following figures are given :v insanity is less prevalent in India than in the West. But it is not improbable that the figures given in the Indian Census return do not include all the half-witted or feeble-minded that would be included in the census for England and Wales. Otherwise one might infer from these comparative figures that the majority of the population is not yet subjected to the strain of living which is extant in the West, and that if a large number of feeble-minded have not been included in the Census figures, that these feeble-minded are perhaps the result of hereditary defects rather than any acceleration in the tempo of living. 17. How far consanguinity in marriages is responsible for the village idiot or half wit is a matter which has never been made the subject for investigation, but that village life in India lends itself to such marriages, may be accepted as a probability. 18. Until the actual conditions prevailing in India of mental deficiency are made known by an authoritative official enquiry, it is premature to suggest any measures for its prevention, either by segregation, sterilisation or imposing restrictions on the relatives or guardians of such cases. 19. Major J. E. Dhunjibhoy, I.M.S., continues to administer the institution with the self-confidence and acumen which characterises this officer. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, L. COOK, COL., I.M.S., Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Bihar and Orissa.
TRIENNIAL REPORT ON THE Working of the Ranchi Indian Mental Hospital, Kanke, in Bihar and Orissa for the years 1930-32. 1. Provinces served.2 Special efforts were made to discharge 43 chronic and harmless patients to the care of their relatives who could be traced out by the Magistrates of their districts. As a result, 18 patients were discharged and in 14 cases no friends or relatives could be found in spite of vigorous enquiries instituted by the Magistrates concerned. In 11 cases inability for financial reasons to take charge of the patients was accepted by the enquiring Magistrates and they were, therefore, not discharged. 5. The maximum number of patients resident in the hospital on any one night was 1,285 (1,049 males and 236 females) in 1932 against 1,280 (1,051 males and 229 females) in 1931, and 1,464 (1,049 males and 215 females) in 1930. 6. Total admissions.3 10. Total duration of hospital life of patients discharged is shown in the sub-joined table :4 12. The chief causes of deaths among patients resident in the hospital are shown in the following table :5 13.

Cases under observation.9 The above table speaks for itself and needs no explanation. More than 50 per cent of the criminal population are murderers ; some of whom have more than one murder to their credit. It is a very grave responsibility thrown upon the administration of this institution to house and guard these acute homicidal insanes with limited staff. This difficulty has been realised by the Government and the extension of the present Refractory Block as included in the scheme of expansion of this hospital has been administratively approved by Government. 17. Statement no. III.10 21. Statement no. VII11 A great deal of what heretofore has been regarded as here- ditary predisposition is now regarded by the psycho-analysts as " quite possibly individual " and due to causes which almost are preventible. In a certain sense a large number, if not all of the psychoses, can be considered as life reactions. That is, a defect of adjustment only develops upon the basis of some weak point in the personality make up and that weak point can be traced to its developmental beginnings in the early life. The presence of unconscious complexes cause reactions such as anxiety and obsessional neurosis, hysteria, etc., which seem to be constitutional only because the real causes are buried from sight. 22. Paying patients.12 a rate which is far in excess of our capacity for biological adaptation This accelerated tempo of living is productive of enormous mental tension and fatigue. Again, modern life stimulates conflict. The unsatisfied desires of the individual tend to increase tension and to breed emotional conflicts. Where democracy prevails it stresses equality of opportunity with the result that the mass of less able individuals must always be discontented with their lot. The failure to achieve reacts upon the personality to cause feelings of insecurity and inferiority and nothing is more productive of mental maladjustment than prolonged feelings of this kind. It may well be stated that the increasing prevalence of mental diseases comes from the very nature of modern civiliza- tion and as India is fast adopting all the methods of modern Western civilization in order to be on equal footing with the civilized nations of the world, it might as well also provide ample facilities for the treatment of its mental and nervous breakdowns. Like the Western countries India must also launch a well organized programme of mental hygiene and all the Indian corporations, municipalities and district boards must help to make it a success. There are thousands of young people (misfits) walking in the streets of India to-day who are unnecessarily doomed to spend some of their time before they die either in jails or in mental hospitals. It is only by appreciating such staggering figures that it is possible to understand the necessity for mental hygiene movement in India. Every country in its onward march to civilization has a complete nation-building programme, and mental hygiene takes a prominent place in such nation-building departments. The following preamble which I quote from the American foundation for mental hygiene will convince any one who is conversant with India and its affairs of the dire need of introducing mental hygiene in India as a means effective to the end of promoting and conserving mental health and ameliorating the scourge of mental ill-health in India :13 23. Suicide.14 (2) A very dependable patient suddenly struck another patient without any provocation with an axe while working in the garden. The injury was serious but fortunately the patient recovered from his injuries. Besides these, there were many minor cases of accidents and injuries during the period under report. 28. Treatment of mental condition.15 (f) Nembutal.16 on Sulphur Therapy in the " Lancet " and the " Indian Medical Gazette "we have received many letters from private practitioners in India making enquiries about this therapy with a view to try on their cases. Recently we experimented with sulphur injection in three cases suffering from the following skin diseases : 17 (a) Teeth.18 I belong to this school of thought and did my best to provide as many and as varied amusements for the patients as funds could permit. Approximately 200 patients attend daily the temporary Amusement Hall of both sections and play various indoor games. As heretofore the Hospital Band continued to entertain the patients in the Amusement Hall, and the Gramo- phones in the Wards for the amusement of those patients who were unable to attend the Amusement Halls. During the triennium, many Foot-ball and Hockey matches were played with outside teams of Kanke and Ranchi and the hospital team won many such matches. The annual sports of the hospital were held every year during the Christmas week and many patients of both sexes took part in it and carried away many prizes. On New Year's eve we arrange a display of Fireworks every year which the patients look forward to and enjoy immensely. During the period under report the hospital staff staged 17 Theatrical shows, and 6 Vaudeville shows were staged by the combined effort of patients and staff. Moreover when any Theatrical, Magic and variety show of repute visit Ranchi we always try to engage them for the patients. The following were engaged to entertain the patients :19 Babu Durga Charan Sarkar, the Reference Clerk of the hospital, voluntarily offered to operate the Cinema machine. He was trained by the Company's Mechanic and now works the machine like a competent Cinema Operator. He is helped by an attendant who has also some training in working Cinema machines.

Dated Ranchi, the 3rd November 1933. READ2 respectively. More than 50 per cent of these criminal insanes had been convicted for committing murders. Having regard to the large percentage of criminal insanes with homicidal tendencies the standard of efficiency maintained by the adminis- tration with the present staff and limited accommodation is a matter for congratulation. There was no case of suicide and only one case of serious injury inflicted by a patient. 3. Government note with satisfaction the improvement in the curative work of the hospital and the decrease in the death- rate. The average daily strength of the hospital was 1258.13, 1259.41 and 1272.75 and the ratio per cent of cases cured to the daily average strength was 4.69, 4.53 and 5.97 respectively during the years 1930, 1931, 1932 while the percentage of death- rate to daily average strength was 2.07, 2.30 and 1.65 respec- tively, as against 3.30, 3.41 and 1.91 during the preceding three years. Though the largest of its kind in India this hospital well maintained its record of the lowest death-rate of all other Indian Mental Hospitals. Some improvement in the number of pay- ing patients treated in the hospital during the last three years is also noticeable, it being 79, 86 and 83 as against 63, 67 and 60 treated during the previous triennium. While Government regret that the scheme referred to in the last triennial resolution for construction of paying patients' blocks could not materialize owing to continued financial stringency and it was therefore not found possible to provide more accommodation for the treatment of non-criminal lunatics, it must be recognized that it is not practicable for them to provide for treatment of all mental defectives in state institutions and as in other more advanced countries the public are expected to come to their relief by opening Mental Homes. At the same time it is true that the question has not become so urgent as it is in the West, where the stress and strain of modern life are far more acute and so cases of mental disorder more numerous. How far the acceleration in the tempo of living has increased mental diseases in this country it is difficult to say but so far as the census figures go to show the ratio of insanes to total population in England and Wales is 21.3 and 102 times greater than that of Bihar and Orissa and Bengal respectively. Treatment by Hydrotherapy was largely resorted to and as many as 407 cases were given this treatment during the triennium under review. The Superintendent reports that the demand for such treatment was greater than what could be provided for with the limited accommodation. Government recognize the desirability of building a Hydrotherapy ward, but the scheme will have to wait till funds become available.
3 Occupational therapy was, however, as usual the principal form of treatment adopted and the work done in this department varied from hard manual labour involved in smithy, carpentry and gardening to fine arts of weaving, lace-making, knitting and embroidery work. The institution was also well provided with sports and amusements including a band and a cinema of its own and it is pleasant to find that the Superintendent and the staff spared no pains to keep the patients happyANNUAL REPORT on the Working of the Ranchi Indian Mental Hospital, Kanke, in Bihar and Orissa for the year 1933 SUPERINTENDENT, GOVERNMENT PRINTING, BIHAR AND ORISSA, PATNA. 1934.

All practicable measures were adopted to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes inside as well as outside the hospital area by the sanitary squads of the hospital under the direct supervision of the Second Assistant Superintendent and myself. In spite of all stringent sanitary measures to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes, no satisfactory results were achieved on account of the vastness of the breeding grounds (paddy-fields) in the immediate vicinity of the hospital which always remained a source of danger. Moreover, a small area within the male enclosure also proved a great menace to the health of the patients of the blocks situated in close proximity of this insanitary area. On account of the deficient drainage in this area, the water stagnates and it helps the breeding of mosquitoes. The managing committee
9 have recommended to Government to rectify this insanitary defect and have passed a scheme costing Rs. 1,180 to provide adequate drainage in this area. Statistics show that nearly 50 per cent of the positive Malaria cases of the year under review were contributed by this insanitary area in the male enclosure. About 10,895 patients were treated as outdoor patients in the hospital for minor ailments such as ulcers, slight injuries, headaches, constipation, etc. 17.

Sulphur injections in mental disorders.14 Use of sulphur injections in skin diseases.15 Raw liver was prescribed in anæmic cases with satisfactory results. Moreover, the following medicines were tried in weak and anæmic cases with encouraging results :16 results. All the cases were found to be bacteriologically negative after the second course. We would have liked to use these drugs in all Malaria cases for obvious reasons, but such was not possible due to the prohibitive cost of these drugs.

Band.20 The following newspapers and monthly magazines were sup- plied to the hospital for the benefit of the patients, free of cost by their respective publishers to whom my best thanks are due :21 The decrease in miscellaneous receipts in 1933 was due to less production of surplus vegetables sold to the public than in the previous year and also less sale of surplus manufactured articles and less income of motor hire from the staff than in the previous years.

ANNUAL REPORT on the Working of the Ranchi Indian Mental Hospital, Kanke, in Bihar and Orissa, for the year 1934 SUPERINTENDENT, GOVERNMENT PRINTING, BIHAR AND ORISSA, PATNA. 1935.
Priced Publications of the Government of Bihar and Orissa can be had fromNo. 11697/11ANNUAL REPORT ON THE Working of the Ranchi Indian Mental Hospital, Kanke, in Bihar and Orissa for the year 1934. 1. Provinces served.2 5 The maximum number resident in the hospital on any one night during the period under report as compared with two previous years was as follows :3 8. The daily average strength of patients resident in the hospital in 1934 as compared with two previous years was as follows :4 hospital for treatment in large numbers amongst our newly- admitted patients until such time the public mind is sufficiently educated in India as to the advantages of early treatment in modern mental hospitals. No matter how much we may deplore it, a strong odium is still attached to mental disease, and the relations desire to keep secret the fact that no one in their family is so affected. In my private practice I have been often requested by relatives to visit the patients after sun- set so that I may not be spotted by neighbours and the fact may not become public. The problem of encouraging early treat- ment cannot be solved without securing the confidence of the patient and of his family and any measure which will conduce to this end is worthy of careful consideration. It will not be out of place to report below the words of His Majesty the King Emperor, while opening the Shenley Mental Hospital in England on 31st May 1934 : " I note with satisfaction that, in designing this hospital, you have paid special regard to the treatment of the mental illness in its early stages by the addi- tion of a Reception Hospital which I look forward to seeing to-day. " Moreover, 40 per cent of this so-called new admissions were not only suffering from chronic mental diseases but were equally bad in their physical health. Good many were admitted in a very low state of health, markedly anæmic with conse- quent debility. Some were treated as suspected cases of Tuber- culosis of Lungs. In fact, tubercle bacilli were detected in the sputum of two newly admitted cases, and one of them subse- quently died. In spite of the above difficulties, 29.36 the ratio per cent of cases cured to the so-called new admissions should be considered as extremely satisfactory and justifies the expense on a modern mental hospital. 11. Death-rates.5 12, The chief causes of deaths among the patients resident in the hospital during the year 1934 are shown below :6 14. The ages of the patients died are shown below :7 The important admissions in the Infirmaries are shown in the table below :8 17. Cases under observation.9 19. Statement no. III.10 compared with 91 (62 males and 29 females) in 1933 and 83 (57 males and 26 females) in 1932. The scheme of building separate wards for paying patients could not be considered owing to continued financial stringency. Several paying patients had to be refused admission for want of proper accommodation. 24. Suicide.11 a few injuries on his person with it ho immediately ran after the Second Assistant Superintendent and also attacked him and assaulted him with the knife causing severe injury on his head before he could be caught and overpowered by the staff. Both the officers, I am glad to. say, made a speedy recovery, under adequate care and treatment. 27. Autopsy.12 (i) Sulphur injections in mental disorders.13 (iii) Rorschach test.14 (viii) Teeth.15 changed. This was a noisy, dirty and destructive ward before and since the introduction of active outdoor garden work every patient on an average has put on 2 to 3 lbs. in weight, they sleep better, there is no noise in the night or day and no sleeping draughts are now required. A brief outline of works done in the Occupation Therapy classes of this hospital is given below :16 special entertainments were arranged for the patients during the year :17 5.

Religion.18 During the year more areas were laid out for growing paddy and sugar-cane and 35 maunds of paddy and 245 maunds of sugar-cane were grown and distributed to the patients. An attempt was also made to make Gur this year from our garden- grown sugar-cane and a very fine quality of Gur was manufac- tured in the Garden and distributed to the patients in place of sugar. The Garden Overseer is now experimenting with grow- ing of bamboos as our demand for bamboo is great and I want the Hospital to be self-supporting in this direction. Similarly our demand for eggs and fowls is also great and a large modern Poultry House constructed entirely by patients' labour is now nearing completion. In 1935 we shall be able to supply our patients with home-laid eggs and home-fed fowls. If the experiment is successful then the Hospital will be self-support- ing in the near future in regard to the supply of eggs and fowls.

Priced Publications of the Government of Bihar, can be had fromNo.10430/ HTRIENNIAL REPORT ON THE Working of the Ranchi Indian Mental Hospital, Kanke, in Bihar, for the years 1933, 1934 and 1935. 1. Administration.2 4. Patients.3 7. The total population, as per statement I, of the hospital during 1935 and that of the two previous years was as follows:4 4. Ankylostomiasis. 5. Gangrene of Lungs. 6. General Debility and Senility. 7. Diseases of the circulatory system. 8. Dysentery. 9. Diseases of the urinary system. 13. Duration of hospital life of those who died during the year and the two previous years is shown in the following table:5 14. The ages of the patients died are shown below :6 The following table shows the classification of the main physical disorders, treated in the Infirmary during the triennium under report:7 The following table shows the number of patients treated at the outdoor department for minor ailments such as headaches, cold, constipation, etc., during the year 1935 and the two previous years :8 This class of patients is treated without difference from the others and enjoy the same liberty and other amenities of hospital life as non-criminal psychotics. Every attempt is made to teach them some handicraft. Curiously enough some of the best behaved and most industrious patients in hospital belong to this category. 19. Statement no. III shows the religion, sex and residence of the patients admitted during the three years under report. 20. Statement no. IV shows the ages of patients admitted during the year and the two previous years. Since adolescence and the early adult stage are critical periods of life at which the Biogenic psychoses, which incidentally are responsible for the largest number of admissions into hospital, make their appear- ance ; it is not surprising that persons between the 2nd and 4th decade are in the majority of those admitted. On the other hand mental deficiency and amentia, which is usually present from birth or an early age, accounts for a surprisingly small number of admissions, although the incidence in the general community would appear to be fairly high. Idiots, imbeciles, and feeble-minded persons being compara- tively harmless are mostly left to their own resources to roam un- treated and uncared for in the general community and to swell the ranks of beggars, vagrants and recidivists. In the absence of a Mental Deficiency Act for India, the Indian Lunacy Act is resorted to, to certify defectives of all grades and ages for admission into a mental hospital as insanes. That some measure of reform in this matter is called for is all too obvious. 21. Statement no. V shows the type of psychoses of those admitted during the year 1935. The clinical conditions treated were:9 Senile or Secondary Dementia. Toxic Insanity. Confusional Insanity. Recurrent Mania. Psychoneurosis. 22. Statement no. VI shows the probable causes of insanity in those admitted during the year. 23. Paying patients.10 In 1935 three elderly patients sustained a fracture of the leg as the result of accidental falls In the case of one, a female suffering from a psychoses of the M. D. type of long standing, it resulted in a marked improvement in her mental condition. A male patient, whose general behaviour was exemplary, one day suddenly inflicted several wounds on his legs while working in the kitchen. With the exception of the above, there were no serious accidents among patients. 27. Autopsy.11 However, every patient is on admission subjected to a thorough systematic examination physically and psychologically. After a period of observation in the Infirmary during which he (or she) is daily interviewed, his (or her) case is treated according to the diagnosis arrived at. The various forms of therapy adopted is summarized below. (a) Sulfosin injections.12 (d) Hydrotherapy. 13 to be somewhat disappointing and uncertain During 1935 how- ever another mode of direct attack, known as the Swift-Ellis methods was carried out in cases of general paralysis. It consists in the injection of the patient's own serum which has been salvar- sanized, into the spinal canal, so that the drug reaches the brain and its tissues directly. The results obtained were more favourable. In this form of therapy, malaria need not be used and its attendant risks thus avoided. (g) Endocrine Therapy.14 The need for a trained occupational instructress for the female section is keenly felt as without a qualified and enthusi- astic worker it is very difficult to train patients or stimulate their interests from lethargy and indolence to useful and helpful occupation with a view to rehabilitation. It is hoped that next year this need will be met. At local industrial exhibitions held in 1934 and 1935 in which some of our products from the occupation department as well as the garden were shown, 9 first prizes and a silver medal were secured. (j) Habit formation.15 During 1935, 20 acres more were brought under cultivation for growing paddy of which 89 maunds were produced. The flower beds and hedges of both sections within the hospital were tended entirely by patients and thereby a sum of Rs 200 that had been sanctioned for the cutting of hedges was entirely saved as this work was done by patients alone and quite efficiently too. Several patients were also engaged in tending a small poultry yard that was stocked with fowls and ducks. A large poultry shed was also erected by the patients. During the year 1935, 2,942 eggs were supplied to the hospital and 170 chicken were hatched. At the height of the hot season when the large tanks began to dry, the stock of fish had to be removed and 3 maunds 36 seers of fish were supplied to the hospital. 30. Finance16 31. Games and amusement.17 During the X-mas holidays a long performance of entertain- ments was provided and on New Year's Day the annual sports were held. On these occasions the entire staff assisted in entertaining the patients and I am grateful for their co-operation in making these functions a success. 34. Staff.18 The hospital was visited by the following officials and other distinguished persons during the year 1935:19 Lectures were also given by me to the medical staff in 1935 at our bi-weekly meetings. The post-graduate students of the Department of Psychology and Philosophy of the University of Dacca visited the hospital, during the Puja holidays as in the previous years and on this occasion I delivered a lecture to them. The Medical students of the University of Calcutta have a course of training at the Bhowanipur Mental Observation Ward, to which the hospital has to send a batch of about 12 patients with the classifical signs and symptoms of various Psychoses for demonstration purposes each year. To my mind this system does not appear to be to the best interest of the students concerned, and I think the practice followed by the University of Patna might well be followed. During the year 1935 I published a book entitled " Modern Methods in Psychiatry " for the use of medical students and practitioners in India. In the years 1933 and 1934 Major Dhunjibhoy, I.M.S., was invited to read the following papers with demonstration of cases at the Indian Science Congress which met in Patna and Calcutta respectively : 20 STATEMENT Showing the admissions, discharges, etc., of patients in the Ranchi Indian 1 2 3 4 5 Years.

Dated the 25th July 1936. READ2 to teach them some handicraft and some of them are reported to be amongst the best behaved and most industrious patients in the hospital. The average number of paying patients during the triennium under review was 91 as against 83 of the last triennium. Improved accommodation was provided for the 1st class paying patients. The provision of special accommodation for paying patients is still under consideration. 4. There was only one case of suicide during 1934. One male criminal patient, a Kabuli, absconded from the Refractory ward on the night of the 24th November 1935 and is still at large. All attempts to recapture him failed. Those of the staff who were guilty of negligence in the matter, have been punished. 5. Treatment of Hydro-therapy was largely resorted to and as many as 829 cases were treated as against 407 cases in the previous triennium. The care of the teeth of patients has received greater attention since the appointment of a visiting dentist to the hospital from the beginning of 1935. The dentist visits the hospital thrice weekly and during 1935 as many as 1,095 patients, both paying and non-paying, were treated. The occupational therapy department was enlarged during 1935 by the conversion of a large store room into a work shed. A high standard of efficiency was maintained in all sections and many indolent and truant patients were revived to activity. It is satisfactory to note that at the local industrial exhibitions held in 1934 and 1935, exhibits from the occupation department of this hospital and from the garden secured prizes and a silver medal. Gardening and poultry form parts of occupational therapy. The primary object of this work is the uplifting of the physical and mental condition of the patients though the garden serves a materially useful purpose also. 6. The games department showed much progress under the supervision of a game master. The attendance of patients at daily out-door games increased and more new games had to be provided. The two amusement halls were also fully attended by patients each evening for music, indoor games, cinemas and theatricals. 7. The total receipts from all sources amounted in round figures to TRS. 24 in 1933, TRS. 23½ in 1934 and TRS. 26 in 1935 as against TRS. 22 in 1930, TRS. 24 in 1931 and TRS. 25 in 1932. The increase in 1935 was due to better realization from paying patients, larger sales of vegetables and manufactured
3 articles and car hire. The total expenditure exclusive of the amount received from paying patients and miscellaneous receipts amounted to TRS. 484 in 1933, TRS. 4,71 in 1934 and TRS. 4,69 in 1935 as against TRS. 5,70 in 1930, TRS. 5,17 in 1931 and TRS. 4,80 in 1932 and the average annual cost per patient was Rs. 376 in 1933, Rs. 366 in 1934 and Rs. 364 in 1935 against Rs. 453 in 1930, Rs. 410 in 1931 and Rs. 377 in 1932. The total expenditure in 1935 fell by rupees one lakh as compared with the year 1930 and the average annual cost per patient by about Rs. 100. 8. In 1935, the Government of Bengal deputed one Assistant Surgeon and two sub-assistant surgeons at this hospital to undergo training in psychiatry for a period of two years. 9. Government are pleased to record their sense of appre- ciation of the valuable assistance rendered by the members of the Managing Committee. Their thanks are also due to the distinguished official and non-official visitors for the encourage- ment which they have given to the patients by their visits and contribution to the donation fund and to the publishers of the newspapers and magazines which were supplied gratis to the patients of the hospital throughout the triennium under review. Government are also pleased to place on record their appreciation of the good work done by Major Dhunjibhoy and during his absence by Dr. Pacheco in efficiently carrying on the adminis- tration of the hospital. By order of the Government of Bihar (Ministry of Local Self-Government), V. K. R. MENON, Offg. Secretary to Government.

Dated Patna, the 25th January 1938. SUBJECT.ANNUAL REPORT ON THE Working of the Ranchi Indian Mental Hospital, Kanke in Bihar for the year 1936. 1. Administration.2 5. The maximum number of residents in the hospital on any one night during 1936 and the two previous years was as follows :3 10. The following is the ratio per cent of cases recovered to total admissions for the year 1936 and the two previous years :4 11. Death-rate.5 The above table shows that more than 50 per cent of deaths occurred amongst old chronic patients who had been in the hos- pital for 20 years and over. 14. The ages of patients died are shown below :6 and its further spread was checked by stringent sanitary measures. Small-pox and Chicken-pox in mild epidemic form appeared to be almost endemic amongst staff children in the staff line throughout the year under review and stringent sanitary measures with timely vaccination and segregation of contacts just enabled us to keep the infection away from the patients as well as the staff. 17. Statement no. II7 21. Statement no. VI8 are treated without certification. The Committee after great deliberation passed the following resolution :9 In the Reception Unit of the Hospital all patients on admis- sion are subjected to a thorough systematic examination both physical and psychological and later they are suitably classified and treated accordingly. 1. Occupational Therapy.10 My visit to the famous occupational therapy centres in Europe and England during 1935-36.11 From the figures given above it will be seen that the results were very good as the treatment affected recovery in 12.05 per cent and improvement in 66.27 per cent of cases. Use of Sulphur Injections in skin diseases.12 the results were rather disappointing. The drug acted as a. powerful hypnotic in two cases only and the majority remained unaffected by it. The results of our first experiment with this drug were given in our 1933 report and since then we had some enquiries from India as well as from England about our further results with this drug, hence this note. However, the drug is well worth a trial in Indian villages or places in India where hypnotic drugs or injections are not available at a moment's notice, because this shrub is abundantly found in the remotest corner of India. The juice of this plant is largely used as a cure for insanity by the Fakirs and Sadhus in India. (e) Photodyne (H13 The three recovered cases were subsequently discharged by the Board of Visitors. Of the 12 patients majority of them were old chronic cases and have been in the hospital without any improvement for the last 4 years and more. Being encouraged by the results of this experiment I wrote to Messrs. Knoll and Co., again to be so kind as to send me enough Cardiazol to experiment on 25 more cases and they have again consented to oblige me and the full results of our experiment with Cardiazol in Schizophrenia cases will be fully narrated in our next Annual Report. I take this opportunity of expressing my sincere thanks to my friend Dr. Meduna for showing me all the detailed techniques of his new treatment with Cardiazol, and to Messrs. Knoll and Co., for the free supply of drug. I also express my indebtedness to Dr. Gyarfas Kalman for his valuable help in this direction.

A visit by the Viceroy to this largest modern Mental Hospital in India is considered a Red letter day for the Ranchi Indian Mental Hospital. Besides, it is a matter of great gratification to state here that within memory His Excellency is the first Viceroy to pay a visit to a mental hospital in India. The hospital was also visited by the following officials and other distinguished personages during the year 1936 :23 Ranchi Indian Mental Hospital has been recognised by the Universities of London and Edinburgh for practice in Mental Diseases for the purpose of the post-graduate diplomas in Psychological Medicine of London and Edinburgh. (3) As I happened to be one of the founders of the Inter- national League against Epilepsy which took its birth at the time of the International Neurological Congress which met in London in 1935 its General Secretary Dr. H. I. Schou of Dianalund, Denmark, wrote to me during the year under report for all-India statistics of epileptics treated in separate colonies and in Mental Hospitals. With the consent of the Director- General, Indian Medical Service, I collected the required statistics from all over India and forwarded to Dr. Schou. Dr. Schou has promised to publish the Indian Statistics together with those of other countries in his International Journal on Epilepsy, popularly known as " Epilepsia ". (4) Opening of the Kanke Employees' Co-operative Society, Limited.24 take up appointments as Psychiatric Social Workers. It should now be the duty of every provincial Government in India to employ these Psychiatric Social Workers to the provincial Mental Hospitals for obvious reasons. I wish all success to this School. (6) Activities of the Superintendent on leave ex-India during 1935-36.25 Neurologists and Psychiatrists of England, Europe and America. Besides, it gives us an opportunity to meet those whose works we have read and we get opinions as a result that cannot be obtained in any other way and which I believe to be invaluable. My repeated visits to the famous Psychiatric shrines of England, Europe and America have not only widened my knowledge and experience in my speciality but incidentally have also brought an International recognition to the Ranchi Indian Mental Hospital.

Dated Patna, the 1938. SUBJECT.THE THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Ranchi Indian Mental Hospital, Kanke, in Bihar, for the year 1937. 1. Administration.2 The increase in the population during the year under report is due to increased accommodation of 44 beds sanctioned by Government from 1st October 1936 in the Male Section of the hospital to relieve congestion. 6. The maximum number of patients resident in the hospital on any one night during the year 1937 and the two previous years was as follows :3 10. The following is the ratio per cent of cases recovered to total admissions for the year 1937 and the two previous years :4 3. Tuberculosis of Lungs. 4. Senile Debility. 5. Heart Failures. 6. Abscess of the Liver. 7. Cirrhosis of the Liver. 8. Status Epilepticus. 9. General Paralysis of the Insanes. 10. Chronic Dysentery. 14. Duration of hospital life of those who died during the year is shown in the table appended below :5 15. The ages of patients died are shown below :6 19. Statement no. III7 I am glad to be able to record that the Government were pleased during the year under report to sanction my scheme as stated in the previous year's report for the conversion of one of the existing spare occupational therapy buildings in the Female Section at a nominal cost into a Children's Ward which will accommodate certified defective children. It is hoped that the work will now be completed without any further delay. MENTAL DEFECTIVES OF INDIA. It will be presumably permissible to mention here that there exists no State or Social Controls for the Mental Defectives in India. No reliable statistics are available as to the number of such defectives in India but if such figures were obtainable they would indeed be very large. In this complex system of social relations what place can be found for the subnormal individual, who starts life, not only with a poor mental endowment; but with temperamental difficulties he can neither understand nor control. He must be protected from dangers and others must be safe- guarded from the results of his social conduct. While every civilised country has made and is making efforts to provide schools and institutions for some at least of its defectives, almost nothing has been done in India for its unfortunate defectives. India's defectives are at large and are allowed to do what they like and in absence of proper segregation and control by the State they thus perpetuate the Mental Defective race of India. The problem, I admit, is very vast, and would appear to be unsurmountable from financial point of view for a poor country like India, but, as India is now making all efforts at onward march of civilisation it should also make a start in this direction, no matter how humble and ineffective it might appear. The Report of the British Royal Commission on feeble-mindedness of England was really very pathetic. It states that 40 per cent of the juvenile offenders were feeble-minded and 20 per cent of the prison population of England were feeble-minded. If we were to make a similar investigation of our Jails in India our figure would treble that of England. Moreover, majority of our Indian idlers, wastrels, never-do-wells, prostitutes, criminals and drunkards are feeble-minded persons. The following table shows the number of criminal patients resident on the 31st December 1937 in the Ranchi Indian
8 Mental Hospital. On thorough investigation, I find that majority of them are mental defectives of various grades :9 (4) Provision of adequate facilities for the training of the whole personnel required for this work such as Psychiatrists, Psychologists, nurses, social workers and teachers. (5) Education of public opinion to a recognition of the racial dangers underlying the unchecked increase of mental deficiency. (6) Eugenic sterilization of all known adult defectives of both sexes. Life segregation in large Central Provincial Institutions and sterilization held out the greatest hope of most immediate and effective results. Sterilization is adopted by a number of civilised countries all over the world and it is a means of ridding the race of its defective germ plasm. Sterilization must supple- ment segregation as a measure of control to prevent procreation because no State, however rich, can ever afford institutional facilities for all their defectives. Sterilization therefore relieves the State of a heavy financial burden and as such it should be indispensable for India. 23. Statement no. VII shows the probable causes of insanity in those admitted during the year. The question of causation is the outstanding problem of psychiatry. There are so many causes which may contribute to a mental break-down that in most cases one cannot specify any one in particular. The patient must be considered as a biological problem. Toxic agents, epilepsy, various bodily illnesses and life's stresses of various kinds must be regarded as in the main contributory and the cause of mental disorders does not lie in any one of the above stated ætiological factors alone, but is the resultant of many such factors. " Heredity " and " Environ- ment " are also factors of considerable ætiological importance and prognostic significance. The " Heredity " of mental disease is rather that of Tuberculosis. The child does not inherit the disease itself but certainly inherits a predisposition to contract the disease under suitable conditions. Next in importance to " Heredity " are "Environmental factors". Some Psychiatrists attach great importance to " Environmental factors" than "Heredity". But I for one feel convinced that " Heredity" does play an important role in the causation in majority of the cases combined with the anxieties and increased stresses of modern every-day life.
10 In support of my views I append below a list showing preponderance of inherited taints in major Psychosis and defects:11 on duty. The Attendant Staff of the Suicidal Wards of the hospital seldom appear in the limelight although on their shoulders rests the heavy responsibility of watching so many potential suicides day and night ; to all of them I owe a deep debt of gratitude and I wish to record my appreciation and sincere thanks for their good work. All potential suicides are constantly on the watch for an opportunity as their life is devoted to counting death. The ingenuity of such patients at times is very great. One female potential suicide, who has apparently made up her mind to drown herself, twice jumped down the hospital well whilst employed on watering the plants in the garden and twice she was rescued by the staff on duty at the well at the risk of their lives. The third time she jumped down a cauldron full of water which was kept on one of the ovens of the kitchen for boiling but fortunately had not reached the boiling point. She was again rescued by the staff on duty. Another patient, a Marwari from Calcutta, has a strong desire to end his life but he wants someone to take his life. Ever since his admission he is asking whoever goes near him to kill him but his wish is not yet fulfilled. Finding that no one seems to oblige him in this direction he hit upon a novel way of killing himself by refusing food and drink, what is in present day known as " hunger strike ", until such time as he is fed by the Governor of Bengal. We induced some friends to impersonate His Excellency in order to make him eat but to no avail, and I am sure even if His Excellency the Governor of Bengal comes to feed him his request to him would be to kill him and he would refuse food. He has been fed nasally twice a day by the staff for the last five years to keep him alive. Many times we stopped his nasal feed for a day or two and induced him to take his food but he flatly refused and fervently requested us to allow him to die of starvation. He is a case of " Involutional Melancholia" and most melancholics are potential suicides. These and other potential suicides of the hospital are watched day and night, yet they must be given certain facilities and freedom on humanitarian as well as therapeutic grounds. In a modern mental hospital where too much freedom is given to all patients the suicides also have their fair share of it and are not locked up day and night as was the case in the old asylums, and some- times they take advantage of this and let down the administra- tion of the hospital who are doing their best for them. But this should not deter a conscientious Medical Superintendent in discharging his duties to his unfortunate suicidal patients, for such accidents must happen even in the best regulated institutions.
12 26. Absconding.13 As usual Rs. 600 was spent in distributing rewards to hard- working patients over and above the daily gifts of cigarettes, tobacco and other comforts. (2) Hydrotherapy.14 It is free from any dangerous complication and does not require such constant medical and nursing supervision nor involve any grave risk as in the case of Insulin treatment of Schizophrenia. I would certainly give this treatment preference over the Insulin Therapy. Acknowledgments.15 one drachm per day. Similarly Paraldehyde can be used as " prolonged continuous narcosis " in highly intractible maniacal cases when given per rectum. The dose in such cases should be one drachm per stone of patient's total body-weight. Say, for example, if the patient's total body-weight is 8 stone the Paraldehyde dose should be 8 drachm mixed with 8 ounces of Saline. This method is largely used in general practice all over the world by Surgeons to remove the pre-operative frights in nervous patients before undergoing major operations. One of our highly excited patients, who showed no signs of improvement or abate- ment of excitement in spite of vigorous treatment by all the known hypnotics and sedatives at our command, showed marked improvement by this method. After the first-day treatment the patient remained quiet for three consecutive days and slept at a rate of 14 to 16 hours a day. This treatment can be given twice or three times a week with due regard to patient's general health. (4) Sulfosin therapy.16 USE OF SULFOSIN IN SKIN DISEASES. During the year under report 36 patients suffering from skin diseases were treated with Sulfosin and the results were as follows :17 Dentistry.18 (c) Cinema.19 similar services without any remuneration. During Durga Puja festival batches of patients were sent to visit the local celebra- tions held outside the hospital. 30. Feasts.20 The flower gardens and hedges inside and outside the hospital were entirely maintained by patients and kept in good order. At the local Agricultural Exhibition in 1937, the hospital secured 4 First Class Certificates for the following :21 Vegetables, fruits, etc. Quantity. Mds. srs. ch.

Retirement.25 The hospital was also visited by the following officials and other distinguished personages during the year under report:26 the period under report. I would also like to record my indeb- tedness to all who were so kind as to contribute large and small sums of money to the Donation Fund of the hospital while on a visit to the hospital or on special appeal from us. 39. Lectures. 27 with your visits to the Medical College here. A definite advance in the training of students and in the treatment of patients in this speciality would thereby be attained. On this occasion a lecture to Post-graduates in Patna, direct or through the B. M. A. or L. M. A. might also be arranged." It is now my fervent request to Government that they will also favourably consider in the near future the opening of a Psychiatric Ward in the Patna Medical College Hospital to facilitate the work of the Psychiatric Clinic by providing in-door treatment of early mental diseases. (3) Investigations.28 In the British Medical Journal of 1937 page 219 a very illuminating article has been written by Drs. P. Phillips and R. T. Cooke on the subject of Typhoid Bacilli stating that as a Pyogenic organism Typhoid Bacillus is well-known as one which may be long in producing this effect. In the article the authors give an exceedingly interesting clinical and bacteriological reports of cases who developed " Typhoid Abscesses " years after the original attack of Typhoid such as 7, 11, 14, 24 and as late as 57 years. The article strengthens my suspicion about my cases that Enteric may be the sole cause of their mental break-down. During 1938, a few more cases of similar type have been admitted into the hospital and the subject is under further investigation and the results will be produced in our next report. (b) Atebrin and mental disorders.29 Committee also recommended to hold the 3rd International Congress on Mental Hygiene at Rio de Janeiro in Brazil during 1940.

The total population of the hospital as per statement no. I during 1938 and the two previous years was as follows :3 11. Advantages of early mental treatment4 11. Diabetes. 12. Heart Failure due to Acute Mania. 13. Heart Failure. 14. Oedema of Lungs. 15. Cerebral Thrombosis. 16. Tuberculosis of Lungs. 14. Duration of Hospital life of those who died during the year is shown in the following table :5 17. Sickness.6 Of the above 60 patients :7 the Psychological treatment as an alternative, or comple- mentary, to a sentence of imprisonment. In this connection it should be remembered that criminals are sent to prison as a punishment and not to be punished, that is to say, the sentence itself is a punishment. The aim of the modern prison administrator is not to add to the severity of the sentence but to effect as far as possible during the time at his disposal, the modifications of character by training and treatment, the faulty personalities in his charge by psychological methods. Today it is generally recognised that conduct, which was formerly attributed to evil intentions and spiritual wickedness, is often due to pathological causes. Besides the usual cases of mental defectiveness and psychosis, the jail population of India is practically teeming with the following groups of offenders :8 23. Statement no. VIIAs usual Rs. 600 was spent in distributing rewards to hardworking patients over and above the daily gifts of cigarettes, tobacco and other comforts. (2) Hydrotherapy.10 given to the patients without any fatal or serious injury and we have so far achieved 40 per cent remission by this useful therapy. Only one patient so far has been returned to us as a relapsed case out of the many who returned home to take up their former activities. During the year under report we have extended the scope of our investigations with the merits of Cardiazol Therapy by administering it to patients other than Schizophrenics, such as Manic Depressive Psychoses, Paranoid reactions type, Psycho-neurotics, Ganja Insanity, etc. The results of our experiments will be published in our next annual report. (ii) Treatment of Manic Conditions by Atropine.11 very much within a short period of the treatment and still maintaining the improvement and the remaining two had a temporary improvement for a period of two months. This treatment is worth a trial in highly maniacal cases which have ceased to respond to ordinary methods of treatment for these conditions. Patients require to be thoroughly watched during the treatment as there is a risk of respiratory failure due to perhaps overdosage or idiosyncrasy of the drug. We nearly lost one of our patients during this treatment. The best antidote in such emergency is strychnine in doses as high as one-tenth grain hypodermically and prolonged artificial respiration. The paraldehyde dose should be one dramme per stone of patient's total body weight and our experience has taught us to give always two drammes less than the total dose of the body weight. (v) (a) Sulfosin Therapy.12 proper antisyphilitic treatment. Moreover, 15 specimens of stool for culture for Typhoid group from old carriers and one specimen of blood for Widal Test were also sent for examination.

One of the modern prescriptions of early nervous diseases in Europe as well as in Harley Street is the recommendation to attend regularly the ball room dance classes. A few months ago I attended a demonstration of the Bratachari Movement in Calcutta under its versatile founder and leader, Mr. G. S. Dutt, I.C.S., Secretary to the Government of Bengal, Local Self-Government Department, and was much impressed with all that I saw, and found many points in common between the Bratachari Movement and the Margaret Morris School of dancing so far as it can be applied to the treatment of nervous and mental disorders. I therefore decided to introduce Bratachari Movement in this hospital as it is more suitable for my patients than the Margaret Morris Movement. Mr. G.S. Dutt very kindly helped us in this matter and he agreed to train one of our staff specially selected for this training. He was allowed to attend the 8th All-Bengal Bratachari Training Camp held in Calcutta for six weeks during 1938. Since his return to Ranchi, he has trained a class of 10 Attendants in Bratachari Movement and shortly regular remedial classes will be held under these trained staff and Bratachari exercises will be pre- scribed to the patients with certain modifications suiting their temperament and physique. I have no doubt whatever that Bratachari Movement properly and skilfully applied will be as successful in the Indian Mental Hospitals for the treatment of mental disorders as the Margaret Morris Movement has proved its worth in the English Mental Hospitals. I take this oppor- tunity of expressing my thanks to Mr. G. S. Dutt, I.C.S., for all the help and encouragement in this innovation of ours. (3) Opening of Psychiatric Clinics at the Patna and Calcutta Medical Colleges.22 The object of the Indian Division is to encourage the study of Mental "Diseases by means of periodical meetings at different Central Mental Hospitals of India, which will provide an oppor- tunity to all Psychiatrists in India to pull their experience and to exchange views on problems of Indian Psychiatry and other allied subjects. The inaugural meeting of the Indian Division took place at Lahore on the 23rd and 24th January 1939. The co-operation of the Central and Provincial Governments which were secured were exceedingly helpful to the formation of this Division and the meeting was well represented by the civil and military branches of psychiatry from all over India. Many important problems of Indian Psychiatry were discussed in full and a few interesting papers were read and thoroughly discussed by the members. The next meeting of the Division will take place in 1941. J. E. DHUNJIBHOY, LT.-COL., I.M.S., Superintendent, Indian Mental Hospital, Kanke (Ranchi).

FROM THE INSPECTOR-GENERAL OF CIVIL HOSPITALS, BIHAR, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BIHAR, LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT. Dated Patna, the 3rd September 1940. SUBJECT.THE FIFTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Ranchi Indian Mental Hospital, Kanke, in Bihar, for the year 1939. 1. Administration.2 6. The maximum number of patients resident in the hospital on any one night during the year 1939 and the two previous years was as follows :3 11. Death-rate.4 15. Health of patients.5 18. Statement no. III6 19. Statement no. IV.7 27. Conservancy and Sanitation.8 state of our knowledge of mental diseases any treatment that gives encouraging results must be tried with a hope of cure or amelioration of the patients' mental conditions, and the shock therapy in spite of its being expensive and highly specialised no doubt gives encouraging results and is worth trying. (a) Cardiazol treatment.9 this problem in normal individuals. He found that, by having the individual breathed N-O2 mixtures with the O2 gradually decreased from 20 per cent to 17, 13, 10, 9 he can produce a gradual anoxia with sleepiness being a predominant feature. After studying the literature on the subject I decided to experi- ment with this treatment and 40 patients were subjected to this treatment during the year under review. I must admit that we failed to produce convulsive shocks by this method, but what emerged out of the experiment was a ray of hope that by given nitrogen inhalation to highly excited patients for five minutes the patients not only quietened down in their excitement but were also able to sleep for hours. Highly excited patients after five minutes inhalation of nitrogen slept for ten minutes to two hours after inhalation and they remained quiet throughout the day and slept for five to seven hours in the night, and some remain quiet after this treatment for some days. Each patient was given this treatment every alternate day until the excitement was abated and natural sleep produced. The maximum period per patient for this treatment was three months and the minimum one week. Our success with Nitrogen Gas Inhalation in excited cases was so great that for some time we temporarily closed down our Hydrotherapy Wards and all old and new highly excited patients with marked insomnia were submitted to this treatment with encouraging results. The results of my experiment were communicated to Dr. Hall and he wrote us a very encouraging letter as follows:10 water and coloured red. Two drams of this mixture are usually given every four hours until sleep has been induced, then one dram often enough to maintain the desired state of somnolence. Constipation must be guarded against and a daily enema must be given. If the proper amount of the drug is given the patient can be aroused, taken to the bathroom, fed, given another dose of medicine, following which he promptly goes to sleep again. The results obtained with this type of therapy in manic and depressed patients are quite encouraging. The patients awake almost refreshed and rested, with considerable gain in weight and a completely new out-look of life. By this method patients are made to sleep from 16 to 20 hours a day. The treat- ment in the first instance can be continued for ten days and later it may be extended up to a month. During the year under review eight schizophrenic and Manic Depressive Psychosis type patients were selected for this treatment. Our results so far are encouraging and will be published in our next Annual Report when the treatment is tried on a large number of cases. The treatment is not free from danger and the complications to be guarded against are :11 (e) Electric Convulsion Therapy.12 (vii) Nasal Feeding.13 I am happy to be able to record that the Talkie Machine which was sanctioned in the previous year was installed during the year under report and has become a great source of enjoy- ment to the patients. Weekly shows are given and the patients look forward with great pleasure for the shows. Cinema serves not only as a source of amusement to patients but it is a therapy in itself and acts as a tonic to rehabilitation of patients. (e) The hospital Band continued to entertain the patients with music throughout the year under report, in both the Sections of the hospital. (f) Paroles and Motor drives.14 The following newspapers and monthly magazines were continued to be supplied to the hospital free of cost and my best thanks are due to their respective proprietors :15 our fowls and in spite of our care and best advice from experts we lost all our best egg-layers16 The following table shows the total garden produce during the year under report :17 Grains.

Dr. Sen during his service in this hospital did splendid work and was a very popular figure amongst patients and staff. The work and general conduct of the staff as a whole were of the usual high standard. I express my indebtedness to the staff as a whole for their loyalty and the whole-hearted co- operation in the management of the hospital in general and to the two Assistant Superintendents for their valuable help and constant loyalty to me in particular. 35. Managing Committee. 20 Twelve meetings in the Male Section and 12 in the Female Section were held during the year under report. The hospital was also visited by the following officials and other distinguished personages during the year under review :21 chari dance along with some of the attendants. Patients have taken a great liking to the Bratachari Movement which was only introduced last year. Mr. G. S. Dutt, I.C.S., the founder and the very life and soul of this movement attended a demons- tration given by our patients and congratulated us for the good start and advised us to keep it up.

Priced Publications of the Government of Bihar can be had fromNo.H.THE SIXTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Ranchi Indian Mental Hospital, Kanke, in Bihar, for the year 1940-41 and also for the period from 1st January 1940 to 31st March 1940. 1. Administration.2 5. The total population of the hospital as per Statement no. I during the following periods was as follows :3 9. The ratio per cent of cases recovered to the daily average strength during the periods under review and the two previous years is shown below :4 12. Chief causes of death during the periods under report were as follows :5 14. The ages of patients died are shown below :6 Besides, 517 and 2,270 patients were treated at the outdoor clinics of the hospital for very minor injuries, ailments, etc., during the periods respectively from 1st January 1940 to 31st March 1940 and the year 1940-41. 17 . Statement no. II.7 The following is a list of criminal patients resident on 31st March 1940 and 31st March 1941 and the crimes committed by them :8 admissions during the year were generally mental stress (in- cluding privation and malnutrition), previous attack, heredity, Cannabis Indica and Alcohol. 23. Paying patients.9 (i) Occupational therapy.10 (c) Treatment of epilepsy by sodium dilantin11 (v) Dentistry.12 3. A few theatrical performances by the students of the Prince of Wales Medical College, Patna, staff and outsiders. 4. Ramayan Katha by Pandit Ramashray Rai, M.A., L.L.B. 5. Magic performance by Prof. Gavin. (c) Bratachari Dance.13 discourses, relating stories from sacred books, and songs were regularly held during the period under report. Besides, several patients observed fasting on different occasions according to their religious beliefs and every facility was afforded to them. During Durga Puja festival hundreds of patients went out to visit the local celebrations held outside the hospital and Id prayers were held inside the hospital. I take this opportunity to express my best thanks to the Panditji and Moulvi Saheb for giving religious therapy to my patients on a very nominal honorarium and to all the Christian Padris for giving similar services to the Christian patients with- out any honorarium. In some patients this therapy was found to be of particular benefit in adjusting their mental conflicts. 29. Feasts.14 fruits. Our garden is perhaps the largest of its kind in Bengal, Bihar and Orissa. I must say that manual labour in the garden has been found to be the best tonic for the maintenance of good physical health in mental patients. It is a note-worthy fact that chronic patients are very good workers in the garden 32. Finance.15 34. Staff.16 9. The Commissioner of Chota Nagpur Division. 10.

Committee of visitors.17 I express my heartfelt thanks on behalf of my patients to all the ladies and gentlemen who contributed freely to our Donation Fund. 39. Lecturers.18 (5) The buildings of the hospital were kept in a good state of repair. The water-supply was maintained satisfactorily throughout the period. The electric supply for the lights and fans was also perfectly satisfactory. (6) Lt.-Col. J. E. Dhunjibhoy, I.M.S., who had been the Superintendent of this hospital since its inception in 1925 and was solely responsible to bring it to its present successful condition, reverted to Military duty on the 15th February 1941.
