Removal of goods to New Laboratory. The packing of the scientific instruments and fittings of the Bacteriological Laboratory, Poona, was commenced in February 1895, and all the goods to the weight of 30 tons, were des- patched by rail to Kathgodam viâ Bareilly by the middle of May 1895. On the arrival of goods at Kathgodam Railway Station, they were transported by bullock cart to Bhowalie, the nearest point to Mukte- sar (19 miles distant) on the Kathgodam-Ranikhet Road. At this point, under the superintendence of Mr. Bamber, Clinical Assistant, a number of the larger boxes were repacked8 The initial cost of the necessary apparatus, including single mahogany triple rack lantern, very best make, 4½ inch condensers, with all the accessories would amount to £ 48-6-6 for each station. I submit the above scheme for the consideration of the Government of India, and the necessary sanction should it be deemed advisable. Tsetse Fly. A subject of considerable interest was initiated by a correspondence between the Honourable the Secretary for Zululand, South Africa, and the Secretary to the Government of India, Revenue and Agricultural Department, dated 27th February 1895, in which the former reported "that investigations were being made by Surgeon-Captain Bruce, A.M.S., as to the so-called Nagana disease, a fatal disease which attacks horses, cattle, and dogs in certain parts of Zululand, and the disease supposed to arise from the bite of the Tsetse fly, which appears, so far, to be identical with Nagana." "The investigator was led to believe, so far as his researches had proceeded, that the disease might also be identical with ' Surra,' which is at present under investigation by Dr. Lingard on behalf of the Government of India." Reports and drawings which would enable Surgeon-Captain Bruce to identify the disease, were asked for, and a water colour drawing of the parasites found by the above officer in the blood of animals suffering from Nagana, and in the blood of animals known to have been bitten by the Tsetse fly, were for- warded (No. 519 M.) for inspection and report. In my letter No. 121, dated 16th May 1895,I reported as follows:9 (iii) A large brown-headed fly, seen only during the rainy season, the mandibles of this fly being adapted for piercing the skin, as it lives by sucking blood. On several occasions in different outbreaks I have demonstrated micros- copically the Trypanosoma Evansi in their blood. The most frequent fly found on equines is a kind of gadfly; the one infesting the dog appears to be a small va- riety of the same species. A collection of the different flies found infesting Surra animals in this country is being made, and will probably appear in Volume III of the Surra Report. I suggested that Surgeon-Captain Bruce be asked, when opportunity offers, to examine microscopically the blood and body fluids of the Tsetse fly for the presence of parasites (Trypanosoma, Nematodes, &c.)10 " In my observations at Karnal, December 1895,I had seen two large Hissar bullocks, the subjects of Surra complicated with severe intermittent fever and the presence of the embryos of the ' Filaria papillosa' in the circulation. One of these bullocks, with a daily range of temperature amounting to 10° F., had succumbed to the combined diseases, but the other was still alive, and at this date (May 1896) has regained its health and is in good condition." 20th April 1896.11 APPENDIX I. JOURNAL OF JOURNEYS DURING 1895-96. 21st May 1895.12 Jullunder District. Jullunder Tahsil.13 Balabgarh Tahsil.14 Malerna, Kákur. These villages used to be full of camels, but few remain at present, and many of the people have been ruined from the losses caused by this disease. The country is reported to be water-logged and subject to ' reh.' 1893. Fyzabad District. Surra occurred in the 3rd Bengal Cavalry, stationed at the Fyzabad Cantonments, in October, November, December, 1893. Fyzabad is low-lying on the banks of the Sarjoo River, which inundates the country up to the cavalry lines in the rains. The disease is said to have first appeared in a squadron of horses, which were out on duty during the rainy season in the Azamgarh District, at Jhaj-man. Many of these died, and the disease also appeared in the horses of the remainder of the regiment. One hundred and fifty (150) horses succumbed to the disease. Surra is said to have also caused considerable loss in 1894. The probable reason, the horses which had been out on duty in 1893 were first attacked, is that they were weakened by exposure to the climate in the rains, and so fell victims to the disease earlier than the others. 1895. Naini Tal District. At Kathgodam, the R. and K. Railway Tonga service lost eight (8) horses in the rains, private owners of riding and ekka ponies losing sixteen (16). 1895. BOMBAY PRESIDENCY. Bombay Tramway Company. The last case to occur during the season of 1894-95 was on January 21st. No further animals were attacked until the rains were well advanced, viz., September, when six horses were destroyed, two in October, three in November, three in December, and two in January 1896. After this the disease stopped. Of the total of 16 horses which succumbed to ' Surra, ' 12 were Australians, varying in age from 6 to 21 years[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page]

It is far more common in the vicinity of the rivers and canals, than it is in the dry portions of the Nardak, for example............." On reference a second time to the map, we note that the most striking Surra area in the south is that bordering on either side of the river Jumna, extending for a varying distance to the east and west of it respectively. In addition to this tract being subject to annual inundation during the rainy season, it is water-logged from the river overflow water, and soakage also takes place on the western side from the Jumna Canal and its branches, while on the eastern side, the canal (East Jumna) is at fault. In the Pipli Tahsil of the Umballa District, we found the Markanda River running from north-east to south-west, and the Sirhind and West Jumna connecting canal crossing it in the opposite direction. A portion of Patiála State jutting into the Ludhiána District, which tract is called the ' Rakh', is watered by a branch of the Sirhind Canal. The Jallundhar and Hoshiarpur districts would not appear to be inundated to the same extent that many others are; the southern limit of the former, however, is subject to flooding by the Sutlej, and the north-east and south-east boundaries of the latter are similarly affected. These tracts are nevertheless reported to be subjected to very severe outbreaks of Surra. The information received with regard to Surra in the Sialkote, Gurdaspur, and Amritsar districts, is as yet limited, but what is known points to the fact that the disease is more sporadic in character, and the outbreaks more circumscribed. APPENDIX III. PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS IN EQUINES DURING HEALTH, AND THE PHASES OF SURRA. In investigating the experimental treatment of Surra, the opportunity was taken of working out certain physiological and pathological problems as far as circumstances would permit. In order to make this enquiry in equines (horses, mules and donkeys), the quantity and composition of the ingesta and egesta have been ascertained during a period of health 17 HORSE XCII.

Two mules, No. I weighing 698.5 lbs. and No. II 705.6 lbs., appeared in perfect health and condition; No. II was fed on lucerne and hay, the other with corn in addition. Dur- ing the period of (28 days) health, both animals walked 3 miles daily after inoculation; the mule receiving corn was only able to walk an average of 1.6 miles, during the first 62 days out of 114 under experiment, whilst Mule No. II, not receiving corn, was able to walk an average of 3.78 miles daily, until death from chloroform 89 days later. In both instances, the quantity of urine excreted during the different periods of health and disease was somewhat similar, but there was a marked difference in the amount of urea. Mule I excreted in health an average of 91.24 grammes daily, which was four times the amount excreted by the other mule without corn. In the case of the former animal, the amount of urea in health was 91.24 grammes ; this was reduced in the latent period by 17.1%. It was further reduced in the paroxysms by 44.0% and in the intermissions by 45.40 %, owing to the animal refusing his corn and part of his fodder at an early date of the disease during paroxysm I. Had the mule continued to eat his corn ration throughout, the amount of urea in the paroxysms would probably have exceeded that of health, as observed in previous cases. In the mule not receiving corn, the amount of urea in health was only 23.54 grammes, which increased 22 % in the latent period, and during the paroxysms and intermissions by 121 and 179 % respectively. The ratios for the different periods in each case, health being taken as 1, were :42 the former case, it was present for nearly an equal proportion of the whole period (55.05%). Further attention should be drawn to the ratio of urea and hippuric acid existing in these two cases43 TABLE XXXII.

The course of this disease (Surra) is characterized by two kinds of periods : (i) Paroxysms, during which the hæmatozon (Trypanosoma Evansi) is present in varying numbers, from 1 to 350,000 in each cubic millimetre of blood: (ii) Intermissions, during which the hæmatozoon is absent. It may be stated, as a rule, that in all animals, the greater the number of hæmatozoa present in the circulation during a paroxysm, the shorter will be the duration of such period. The duration of a paroxysmal period in India varies between three and ten days, according to the animal attacked. In experimental animals (horses), when the disease has been transmitted by means of a trace of soiled blood placed in a slight superficial scratch, the paroxysms may last as long as 22 days, but the organisms rarely exceed 400 in each cubic millimetre of blood. Although during the intermissions of Surra, the most careful microscopical examination of the blood has failed to discover the presence of a single hæmatozoon, nevertheless during such a period, lasting five days for instance, if a fresh guinea pig be inoculated with a like quantity of blood (0.3 c.c.) on each of the days making up the period, it generally happens that four out of the five animals will contract Surra. The blood extracted on the first or second day of the intermis- sion, is the sample -which fails to reproduce the disease in the guinea pigs. The period of incu- bation after such inoculation, however, varies considerably in length in animals of the same species. In one experiment when the blood of the second day of the intermission failed to re- produce the disease, the latent period in the third guinea pig was 19.5 days, in the fourth guinea pig 8.5 days, and in the fifth animal 6.5 days, whereas in ordinary inoculations, guinea pigs injected subcutaneously with soiled Surra blood from the horse, contract the disease in from four to five days. Successful inoculations have been made with blood taken from horses, which succumbed to Surra, up to 18 hours post mortem, but not later. It has been previously noted, that the changes brought about in the blood by the hæmato- zopn in Surra cases are61 power increased throughout the course of the disease, but was especially marked in the intermis- sions, when the organism was absent, and the temperature consequently low.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGIST FOR THE OFFICIAL YEAR 1896-97. THE Laboratory is not yet complete, work with regard to the installation of gas is proceeding, but the small house to contain the sterilizing apparatus and the cinerator have not yet been commenced. As has already been reported to Government, great difficulty is experienced in obtaining fodder at Muktesar, owing to the small amount of cultivation in the hills. The harvest only supplying the wants of the inhabitants for a portion of the year. The neighbourhood of the Laboratory is sparsely popu- lated and the services of agriculturists are difficult to obtain, owing to the fact that each family has a certain amount of land belonging to them, and this they cultivate during the months of June to September, inclusive, to supply millet, etc., for their own requirements. At the commencement of October, the inhabitants leave the hills with their cattle and proceed to their holdings in the Bhabar and Terai, where they remain until the following year. In conse- quence of the anxiety caused last year owing to the absence of fodder, during which period (four months) our animals subsisted principally on oak leaves, I represented this to Government, and after making careful enquiries, as to the best means of procuring supplies of grass, etc., for our ponies and cattle, submitted a method which would admit of work being carried on at the Laboratory. This scheme, however, did not meet with approval. Consequently, in September, I employed a number of coolies to cut as much grass as possible and stacked it for use during the winter. Coolies are obtained here with great difficulty, and the amount of grass cut and stacked was small, costly and quite insufficient to tide our requirements over the hot season, the period when it is impossible to obtain further supplies. A further representation will be made on this subject, as it is quite impossible for work to be carried on, if the where- withal to feed animals be not forthcoming. In continuation of my investigations commenced in 1891, with a view to determine whether the Surra parasite is ever present in the body fluids of flies, ticks, etc., other than when caught upon the bodies of diseased animals, I determined during 1896 to visit the localities known to be Surra centres within reasonable distance of the Laboratory, viz., Kathgodam-Naini Tal Dâk line, Saharanpur-Mussoorie Dâk line, and Karnal2 the horses of the Saharanpur-Mussoorie Dâk line, at which period of the year the disease does not exist as a general rule in that part of India, I proceeded to visit the line with a view to determining the accuracy of the diagnosis. I visited all the stations in the Mohand Pass, where the disease had been report- ed to exist. A careful microscopical examination of the blood of the whole of the horses and mules, some 150 in number, was made, with the result that no case of Surra could be detected. At the same time I took the opportunity of examining stagnant and other water and the body fluids of various horse flies, ticks and fish, with a view to ascertaining whether the " Trypanosoma " existed in them. In every case, however, negative results were registered. In addition, observations were made with regard to the presence of the Filaria papillosa (equi) in the circulation of equines examined for the Surra parasite. On my return from Mohand, similar investigations were conducted in and around Saharanpur as well as within the Government Remount Depôt, with the same end in view, and with negative results. Proceeding thence to Karnal (Punjab) on 8th June, an extensive series of observations were conducted, which included the examination of samples of water from every available source, in addition to the blood of samples of the contained fish and numerous specimens comprising some eight different species of flies and ticks. The blood of thirty Government bullocks was submitted to microscopical examination to determine the presence or absence of the Surra Trypanosoma and the embryos of the Filaria papillosa. During my stay at Karnal, an oppor- tunity offered itself, which allowed of my observing the symptoms and course of the disease in a horse attacked with paraplegia, etc., and subsequently of making an autopsy on the animal. The results of my inquiries during this tour are given in the report. In accordance with my previously arranged plan to make a second series of observations during the rains, and just before Surra usually manifests itself in equines, I visited Saharanpur on 7th September, but the results of my investigations proved negative. From thence I proceeded to the Mohand Pass. The blood of some 130 horses and mules were here submitted to examination, with the result that the Surra hæmatozoon was discovered in the circulation of only two animals, which were in fine condition and stabled at an elevation of 3,000 feet. These horses belonged to a European firm. On my return to Saharanpur, I was informed that many cattle were dying of rinderpest at and around the village of Sultanpur, some eleven miles away. Consequently, I proceeded there and was able to make several post mortem examinations and obtain pathological material for subsequent examination at the Laboratory. On 14th September, I proceeded to Karnal and then proceeded to repeat similar investigations to those carried on during my previous visit in May. During my sojourn in Karnal, information was brought in that several horses were ill and losing flesh at the village of Tikri, where several Government and Municipal stallions are kept. On proceeding thither, microscopical examination proved the presence of the Surra organisms in the blood of a mare belonging to the " Lambardar " in charge of the sires. Notice of the above was immediately sent to the Inspector-General, Civil Veterinary Department, and the necessary steps taken for the removal of the horses. On leaving Karnal, I received instructions to proceed to Simla, and, as privilege leave was due to me, the Government of India requested that I should at once proceed to England and there assist the Secretary of State for India in his selection of an Assistant Bacteriologist. After making a careful enquiry and interviewing various gentlemen, I submitted the name of Doctor J. W. W. Stephens as the gentleman most fitted for the post, and his services were accepted. The Secretary of State further sanctioned the deputation of this officer to visit the Chief Laboratories of Europe during a period of 60 to 70 days, with a view to making himself conversant with the methods, etc., employed by the principal Bacteriological savants of Europe, previous to his departure for Bombay, India, where he was ordered to report himself at the
3 commencement of the ensuing official year, April 1897. I regret to say that Dr. Stephens did not, however, avail himself of the opportunity offered. On my return to Bombay, 30th January 1897, your office letter No. 97C., dated 28th January 1897, was handed to me, whereupon I left for the Labor- atory, Muktesar, and arrived on the evening of 5th February. Here your telegram, dated 1st February, awaited my arrival, informing me of an outbreak of disease among the Army Siege Train and Army Transport Bullocks at Quetta, further I was requested to place myself in communication with Veteri- nary Captain H. M. Maxwell, Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Baluchistan. In consequence of the information received from this officer I left the Laboratory on Sunday, 6th February, and proceeded to Quetta, arriving on the evening of 11th February. There I learned that thirty-one bullocks had succumbed during December 1896, and January 1897, and that eight had recovered, while three had died and six recovered amongst a draft of animals sent to Sibi from Quetta. Unfortunately, during a sojourn of eight days at the former station, only one animal succumbed, but I was fortunate in being able to examine the organs of several animals which had been preserved for inspection. The conclusion I arrived at as to the cause of the mortality was that the animals whose power of resis- tance to disease had been previously weakened by nutritive changes, etc., partially owing to the presence of large numbers of hydatid cysts in their organs, had fallen ready victims to pneumonia and pleurisy during the prolonged period of severe weather. A report embodying recommendations for future guidance was submitted to the Government of India for the infor- mation of the Military Department. On the return journey to Muktesar in accordance with Government of India instructions, No. 97C., paragraph 3, dated 28th January 1897,I proceeded to Agra to inspect the Laboratory and grounds of the Chemical Analyst and Bacteriologist to the North-Western Provinces and Oudh, with a view to determine whether rinderpest investigations could be satisfactorily carried on there during the winter months of each year. A report embodying my views, No. 264, dated 12th March 1897, was submitted to Government on my return to head-quarters. During the past seven months, 21 tubes of Mallein have been distributed to the officers of the Civil Veterinary Department and Army Veterinary School, Poona4 a period of observation and the phases of Surra. The object in view as in equines was to elucidate the changes which take place in the blood of animals previous to and after contracting Surra, together with an inquiry into the ingested and egested nitrogen and water, for the purpose of explain- ing the rapid waste of tissue in this disease.

The water was subjected to boiling before the animals were allowed to drink it. The grass instead of being obtained from the plains has for years been collected during the cold season of the year (November, December and January) from the highlands at an altitude of 4,500 feet; all gram and corn has been carefully cleaned and screened since 1894, in order to avoid the presence of rat excrement, and the creeper (Bel) has not been utilized during the past year as fodder, as is the case in the Simla Dâk service. After eliminating the above sources of the contagium of Surra, only two (as far as we know) are left for consideration :- (i) If one animal contracts the disease through the disobedience and stupidity of its syce, i.e., by allowing the animal under his charge to graze or drink by the wayside, on the return journey to its Chowki12 TABLE I.

There is a Police Post at May-myo, which is situated on the Shan plateau at an eleva- tion of 3,600 feet, and is some forty miles distant from Mandalay. The stages are Tonbo, Nyaungbaw, and Thondaung. Tonbo is at the foot of hills, the land is low-lying, i.e., paddy fields, etc., etc. There is a good deal of bamboo jungle about. The Tonbo stream runs alongside of the road, but once the rains commence, pools of stagnant water are formed all over the place. The grass obtained here is rank. Nyaungbaw is on the Zebingyi plateau. Water from a running stream ; the grass is coarse. Thondaung.14 I have never observed ulceration of the small intestines, but have noticed circumscribed local congestions. In a few cases extensive mucous congestion was noted. The intestines often contain a quantity of a very yellow fluid. Nothing remarkable to note about conditions of the large intestines. In advanced cases the spleen is generally enlarged; there is as a rule an excess of pulp so that it pits on pressure. The structure is at times disorganized. The liver is usually very healthy ; cases of congestion, softening, may be met with ; mili- tary calcareous deposits are often seen. In some cases the organ is much enlarged. I have noticed flukes in the livers of some cases. Kidneys.15 TABLE II.

From what I know of this malady I am convinced that it is impossible to prevent its occurrence in tracts where the disease is endemic. As Government transport have to pass through such tracts every season carrying rations to stations in the Chin Hills, Bernardmyo, and Kengtung, I am of opinion that much can be done towards reducing the terrible annual mortality. To begin with, now that there are permanent camping grounds on the roads to the Chin Hills and Bernardmyo, and the dates on which the rationing will commence is known for some time previous, I see no reason why a certain number of muleteers under good Non- Commissioned Officers should not be sent off a month before the animals are expected to arrive, to each of the suspicious camping grounds. During this period grass could be collected, dried, stacked in sheds at a trifling cost; ten men working at each camp ought to collect 15,000 to 18,000lb. of grass in a month. In places where paddy straw is procurable, it might also be stacked and used as chaff. I would recommend that these grass cutting parties be permanently employed during the working season. Good fodder can be procured during the months of October, November, December, and part of January. If this suggestion is carried out, sufficient fodder could be collected to carry the animals through the remaining months of the open season. All men selected or volunteering for this employment should be subjected to strict medical examination, and only those who are strong, and who have not been subjected to fever be allowed to proceed. In order to prevent mules grazing while on the march, I would suggest that a muzzle be provided for each animal ; they should be put on before the mules leave their standings, and on no account removed till they are tied up at their pickets at the next camp. As matters now stand, it is impossible to condemn a day's grass-supply, no matter how bad it may be, as the animals would have to go without. Water-supply. A good well should be sunk at each of the bad camps. The open wells now found in camps are not to be trusted, as in a great many cases they have been sunk in such low-lying places, that during the rains no trace of them can be seen, thus all manner of filth and organic matter gain entrance into what is supposed to be good drinking water. Tube wells might be employed ; they are portable, inexpensive, and I understand easily sunk. These would yield a purer and clearer water than that obtained from open wells, ponds, etc. Two or three troughs or dug-outs for watering purposes could easily be made. A Non-Commissioned Officer should he held responsible that mules are not allowed to water at any place than that provided for the purpose. In the Chin Hills I have seen native trader's ponies, Panthe mules, caravan cattle, all drinking from the same places that Government animals are watered at. All wells, etc., where Government animals are watered at, should, if possible, be fenced in and drinking places provided for outside animals. Sanitation. The importance of keeping all camps in a clean state should be impressed on all persons in charge of convoys ; every standing should be cleaned and all stable refuse, litter, dung, etc., must be burned daily by a fatigue party, there is no excuse for allowing refuse to accumulate month after month. Where space permits, camping grounds, or rather the standings, should occasionally be changed. Panthes or caravan people should not be allowed to camp on our grounds. Animals must not be crowded ; plenty of room between pickets should be allowed to permit free circulation of air. Animals which are to be sent on rationing might be put on arsenic for some little time before starting ; it should also be given in small quantities, now and again, while the animals are working in these unhealthy places, but this of course could not be done until proper super- vision is provided. I am of opinion that this drug should not be placed in the hands of Salutris and other natives. The rationing should be done as quickly as possible, as I feel sure that there would be less Surra if arrangements were made to enable animals to be moved from infected areas by the first week in April. The June outbreaks point to the disease being contracted during the latter end of April and early part of May. Heavy thunderstorms occur about this time followed by excessive moist heat. Organisms which lie dormant during the hot season suddenly become active, and assume fresh phases of development. The rain being particularly heavy, all kinds of active organic matter is washed into tanks, marshes, etc. The tired muleteers are only too delighted to obtain grass near at hand and are not in the least particular as to how they cut it; the result is, that quantities of grass is cut beneath the surface of the water, and, as there is no time to dry it, it is placed before the animals with the portions that have been submerged covered with slime and other filth, which is well known to harbour all manner of low organ- isms. Fatigue, exposure, indifferent and insufficient food, no doubt, as with other ailments, act as predisposing causes. In the Military Police we find that the earlier we bring ponies down to the dry zone, the less animals we lose. This year, as far as I am aware, we have not lost any animals out of those brought down from stations like Katha. Last year we did not get them down till end of D
18 May and beginning of June,.the losses were very heavy. This season the transport working on the Ruby Mines road did not return to Head-quarters till some time in June; the losses amongst these animals will be terrible. (Between April 1896 and April 1897, 220 mules succumbed to Surra in Mandalay). Undoubtedly one great fault is the utter want of knowledge of animal management on the part of the natives in charge ; some in time may gain experience, still it is expensive for Government. The Salutris and Jemadars I have met over here are incompetent to give any sound advice on matters affecting the health and welfare of animals, and are only just able to treat the most simple ailments. So long as there are defects in the feeding, watering, and gen- eral care of Transport, so long will the animals suffer severely from enzootic diseases. While at Head-quarters the greatest care is taken to see that the animals get good dry grass, excellent water, that they are properly and regularly groomed, and that the stables, standings and vicinity are kept in a sanitary condition ; yet when these some animals are called upon to perform severe work, and require, if possible, even more care than when in cantonments, they are handed over practically to the tender mercies of Transport Jemadars and Muleteers. These men are very willing, and when looked after, excellent men for the work which should be required of them. Two points, I wish to bring particularly to your notice, are :- (a) The urgent necessity of providing ample European supervision with Government Transport, and (b) The desirability of getting the rationing over as early as possible, even if extra animals have to be employed. Hired Transport. In this Province Bullock and Mule Transport can both be obtained. Pack bullocks are slow, easily stampeded, and as baskets are employed for carrying purposes, it is necessary that Government Packages be undone. The bullocks carry from 140 to 160 lb. The risks of contracts not being fulfilled if foot and mouth disease or rinderpest should attack the animals. The advantage is that it is inexpensive. Panthe and Yunnanese mule transport, if obtained at moderate rates, must prove a saving to Government. Government has no risks; with mules all work is pretty sure to be carried out. Government could considerably reduce their permanent transport, thus saving keep and establishment. All work must be pushed through as quickly as possible, as the Panthes are well aware what the results will be if they are kept out too long. These muleteers are willing, cheery, and hardworking, if treated well. The mules being small, they can only carry from 120 to 130 lb., and the men naturally resent any attempts at overloading. I have little doubt that, if due notice be given, ample transport will be obtained. When prevalent. April is the only month in which I have up to the present not met with a case of Surra. The heaviest mortality usually occurs between June and October. June, July and Septem- ber may, I think, be taken as particularly bad months, though outbreaks severe enough occur in August and November. As in India we meet with this disease in two different climates, viz., in places where there is a moderately high temperature, an atmosphere charged with moisture, heavy rain- fall and considerable inundation of country ; also where the climate is dry, the temperature very high, and the rainfall moderate or slight, it must however not be overlooked that in such places, though the register may show only a moderate amount for the year, the rain at times comes down so hard-and-fast that tanks are quickly filled, and low-lying tracts inundated. Surra prevails at certain seasons throughout Upper Burma, also in the Shan States and the Chinese say that at times it is very bad in Yunnan. In some years the Chinese suffer heavy losses along the trade routes from Bhamo. In Lower Burma one does not hear so much about Surra, for the simple reason that columns do not go out, and most of the animals are in the hands of private individuals who look after them. In 1890 I witnessed one bad- outbreak in the Thayetmyo district. Steel saw it in Toungoo and Rangoon. I have to note an outbreak amongst some private animals in Rangoon. The first case brought to my notice was on the 17th of September of this year, and is the first case I have met with in an animal that had not been out of the station. I will let you have some notes on it later on. It is surprising that Burmans, owing to their system of feeding ponies, do not suffer heavier losses; the grass is chopped up and mixed with water; grain is frequently given in the same way. The reasons given me are (1) That their forefathers always fed animals in this way and found it answer well, (2) That ponies must digest their food as they cannot bolt it, (3) That owners are too lazy to clean the grass and grain, so mix it with water. This is probably the correct reason. A great many cases must arise from eating bad grass; we all know the customs of ordinary grass-cutters, so we can hardly blame the tired muleteers
19 for obtaining grass with the least possible labour from swamps, ponds, or the beds of recently dried tanks or nullahs. The state of these latter places just as the evaporating process approaches completion, is horrible, simply a mass of foul smelling, putrid green slime containing myriads of low organisms Stacking grass would, at least to a great extent, protect animals against this source of infection. Period of Incubation. I regret I cannot afford any accurate information, I should think from twenty-five to seventy days or even longer. Mules and ponies, old and young, male and female, of all sizes and colours are attacked and die of the disease. I do not believe that sex, age, colour, or breed exercises any influence in the matter. Animals in the "Pink" of condition succumb as, or even more rapidly than, those that are weak and in a debilitated state. Burman ponies and Panthe mules contract the disease as readily as imported animals. We will no doubt hear a good deal about flies serving as transmissive agents, now that Dr. Bruce has established the fact in connection with the " Nagana " or " Tsetse-fly " disease. As in South Africa I am certain the flies possess specific venom; though I have never served in Africa I venture to state that certain tracts in this province could compete very favourably with the special " fly tracts " of any other country. In Burma they are particularly bad after the first few thunderstorms, i. e., the end of April and early part of May; indeed they are so troublesome that Burmans when obliged to take carts, etc., etc., through them, take the precaution of making torches of strips of bark of one of the wood-oil trees, I think the Dipterocarpus Laevis, Burmese (Kanyin-ni). After lighting the torches, they tie a bundle of green twigs with leaves on to make them smoke well,20 Ordinary parasites are constantly met with, and now and again flukes. This year I came upon a very bad case, there must have been quite two hundred parasites in the liver, which organ was much enlarged. Flies. Like yourself I have failed to detect anything like the Surra Hæmatozoon in jungle flies, and I have examined a very great number. They were just coming out in myriads when I visited the jungle. There is a species of fly which, from the accounts of its bite, I should say, is capable of inoculating healthy animals, i. e., granting Surra cases were mixed amongst healthy animals.. From the accounts of the fly and the peculiar appearance of the bite, I think, it is similar to or identical with the fly met with at Thandaung in the Karen and Binjiji in the Shan Hills. This fly is a little larger than the ordinary house fly, but varies in size; its body is yellowish in colour, the legs being bent on themselves. At the point where this fly bites, a small extra- vasation of blood appears just under the skin, which shortly after presents the appearance of a blood bleb, such as follows a contused wound. I will examine the flies in one or two localities I know, but they are so terribly unhealthy, that one is quickly driven out by one's servants being rolled over with fever. We are getting some thunderstorms and this is the time when I am sure that the ani- mals contract the disease ; the water is at its very worst and is stirred up with all manner of filth. The flies at this time are present in great numbers. One thing about the Surra being the same as the South African malady, is that wild animals do not appear to die of it; surely they cannot be all immune. Animals like the Gaur (Indian bison), Tsaing, etc., would be sure to catch it, but they never do, from all I can learn. Rinderpest, foot-and-mouth disease they do get, yet these animals live in heavy jungle where the flies are so annoying to them that they have to go in the open to escape. Again, consider those cases that occurred amongst mules working between the Commis- sariat Lines and the shore at Mandalay. There is no jungle there and horse flies were not troublesome. At that time there were no cases of Surra in Mandalay, at least that we knew of. I also lost two or three animals belonging to the Military Police, and these had never left the station during the season. I am informed that a great deal of Surra prevails between Taung-gyi and Keng-tung. There is a considerable area of swampy country about, and flies are very troublesome while passing through forest tracts. As Military Police ponies have to go to unhealthy outposts, I have recommended that animals posted after 15th March should be allowed to remain at such places throughout the season. It is a pity to relieve the ponies every time the men are changed, for it often means that most of the ponies in a Battalion become infected instead of a few. SURRA OUTBREAK AT RANGOON. Veterinary Captain Evans narrated the following account of an outbreak of Surra in a private stable in Rangoon during his recent visit on deputation to Muktesar. As it is of such importance to owners of equines in many districts of. India, where the disease is enzootic, I have added it to this officer's notes on Surra previously recorded. On September 17th, 1896, an outbreak of Surra occurred in the cantonment, among the horses belonging to a civilian ; no case had been observed during the previous seven years in Rangoon, with the exception of two or three animals which arrived from Upper Burma with the disease. In these the malady was speedily diagnosed and the ponies destroyed. The animals kept by the above gentleman consisted of selected country-breds, Burman ponies and one Arab. The stables were pucca built and the best in that part of Burma, being situated on high ground, in an open compound, seven and-a-half acres in extent, and sur- rounded by a stone wall. The grass supplied to the animals was specially brought in from high ground some five miles distant, where it had been procured for some years past. The water was obtained from a pucca well in the compound. The grain ' crushed food' was the same as that supplied to most stables in the station and procured from Calcutta. The stable containing the Burmans and Arab were situated on the south side of the paddock, while the country-breds were kept in a stable on the north side and in close proxi- mity to the adjoining compound, only a road intervening Eight animals died or had to be destroyed within 14 days on account of having contracted Surra, and veterinary surgeons and owner were nonplused as to how the animals could possibly have contracted the disease. Just at that time a break occurred in the rains, and, as always happens, under such circumstances, flies were very numerous and aggressive. A few days later it came to notice that a pony was ill in the adjoining compound. On microscopical examination of its blood the Surra Hæma- tozoon was found to be teeming. This animal received green grass as fodder, from anywhere the grass cutter could most easily obtain it. As all the animals with the exception of the Arab were allowed to run free in the compound, it is more than probable, therefore, that flies were the means by which the contagium of Surra was carried. This outbreak only tends to emphasise the importance of recognising Surra at the first possible moment, in order that the subjects may be destroyed forthwith, and so do away with a focus for the dissemination of the disease by flies.

APPENDIX III. A.24 APPENDIX III A. SURRA IN BOVINES AND BUFFALOES. The course which Surra takes in bovines, when acquired either spontaneously or after inoculation, has been very briefly pointed out in my earlier reports on this disease. It will be as well, however, to recapitulate the leading facts known concerning these animals, in order to compare them with the symptoms and course of Surra in buffaloes now recorded for the first time. Some five or six bovines were subjected, at Poona, to inoculation with the Trypanosoma from different animals, viz., horse, rat, and the latter organism after it had been passed through equines. All these animals survived, the first attack of the disease, and subsequently were respectively exposed to re-inoculation with material obtained from a more virulent source to that injected on the first occasion. In no instance did any serious symptoms follow as a consequence, but at a later period, Bull No. III and the calf contracted rinderpest spontane- ously, and succumbed to it, 232 and 234 days respectively, after the date of their re-inocula- tion with Surra. In the following précis will be found the chief facts noted in the case of each animal together with a tabular statement, giving the fullest details. Bull No. I.25 The latent period occupied three days. The Hæmatozoon was present in the blood from the 3rd to the 9th August inclusive. After an interval of thirteen days it was again present in small numbers for two days, August 23rd and 24th. After a second interval of nine days it re-appeared for one day on the 3rd September. During a further period of 158 days accompanied by daily microscopical examination of the blood, no organisms were observed. The temperature became rapidly elevated after inoculation and attained a maximum of 41.4°C. on the 4th day of the disease, and then gradually fell until the morning of the eighth day when it registered 38.8°C. It again rose to 41°C. on the 37th day. The pyrexia, since November 14th, has been characterized by morning remissions and evening exacerbations especially on the 143rd, 155th, 156th, 168th and 178th days of the disease. During the months of August and September this animal became greatly emaciated, but by December had put on a considerable amount of flesh and appeared quite healthy. On the 3rd September 1892, the 191st day after inoculation, and the 158th since the last appearance of the organism in the blood, it was decided to re-inoculate the animals with Horse Surra blood, in order to test whether any protection had been acquired from the previous inoculation. Consequently on 9th February 1893 the animal was re-inoculated sub-cutaneously with 2.0 c.cm. of blood drawn from the jugular vein of Horse No. LXXXIV immediately after death, but which just before death contained numerous Hæmatozoa. No swelling or 26 (ii) The amount of swelling and 27 of large numbers of the Filaria papillosa in the blood, in addition to varying numbers of the Trypanosoma Evansi. For three days previous to the death of No. 13 the temperature ranged between 95° and 105° F., a variation of ten degrees, but at the autopsy few pathologi- cal changes were noted, and those of a slight character. No. 152 Bullock, which presented quite as an advanced condition of Surra as the one that succumbed, very gradually recovered. At a later date, September 1896, had put on flesh and presented a good condition, although for some time it was quite off its feed, and only ate when tempted by lucerne grass placed in its mouth. The temperature in this case ranged between 99° and 107° F., and for a considerable period after the special Surra symptoms had passed the morning remissions and evening exacerbations of temperature were most marked. This fever of an intermittent type was not due to Surra or Filariasis only, alone or combined, but was a special form of disease of malarial origin. For at Karnal malarial fever in bovines and equines appears alone, as well as complicating other disorders. Bull V (Hill animal), aged two years, was kept under observation from the 27th Novem- ber, 1896, until 15th February, 1897. On the 16th February it was inoculated on the ear, a minute incision being made and a trace of blood containing a few Hæmatozoa, taken from Buffalo I, was placed between the edges of the wound. The latent period occupied six days. The Hæmatozoon was present in the blood from the 1st to the 3rd of March inclusive. After an interval of three days it was again present in large numbers for four days, March 7th to the 10th; after a second interval of five days it re-appeared for one day on the 16th March. During a further period of 147 days, accompanied by daily microscopical examinations of the blood, no organisms were observed. During the period of observation lasting 89 days the temperature varied between 39.3° and 36°C., and between 38.9° and 37.1°C. during the latent period of the disease. On the appearance of the Hæmatozoon the temperature became rapidly elevated and attained a maximum of 42.5°C. (108.5°F.) on the third evening, and then gradually fell until the morning of the 7th day of the disease; when it registered 37.5°C. It again rose to 40.5°C. on the 9th, and remained at that point until the evening of the 10th day, when it fell to 37.4°C. The pyrexia since March 11th has been characterized by morning remissions and evening exacerbations, especially on the 42nd, 49th, 58th, 102nd, 116th, 125th days of the disease. During the months of May, June, and July, this animal became greatly emaciated, but during August commenced to put on flesh and fill out again. August 31st, 1897.28 TABLE V.

Up to the time these experiments were undertaken there was no evidence forthcoming to show whether buffaloes are susceptible to the organism of Surra or not, although it was surmised that, if bovines were capable of contracting the disease, buffaloes would not be exempt. We had previously shown that bovines passed through an attack of Surra, and if uncomplicated with any other disease the animals always survived, even when re-inoculation was resorted to after varying periods. In our previous researches the experiments were conducted either in the plains or at an altitude of 1,850 feet; consequently, when these investigations were initiated on buffaloes in the hills at a height of 7,500 feet, it was decided to ascertain concurrently what effect, if any, was produced on bovines by the change of elevation, temperature, etc. The opportunity was also taken of working out certain physiological and pathological problems, as far as circumstances would permit, on very much the same lines as those adopt- ed in the case of equines, a précis of which were included in the Report for 1895-96. In order to make this enquiry in bovines and buffaloes, the quantity and composition of the ingesta and egesta have been ascertained during a period of observation, previous to inocula- tion, the incubatory period of the disease, and the paroxysms and intermissions until death. The following data were recorded, viz., the weight and composition of the ingesta, including fodder and water ; also that of the egesta, including dung and urine. In the Urine the total Nitrogen, the Urea, the Hippuric Acid and Ammonia were sepa- rately estimated. UNTREATED CASES OF SURRA. BULL V.

If the percentages of the different corpuscles present in the blood of Bovines and Buffaloes in the massed periods of Surra be compared with similar returns recorded in equines* (horse and mule), it will be seen69 NOTES CONCERNING SURRA IN BOVINES AND BUFFALOES. Although horses which contract Surra by inoculation with the hæmatozoon of the Rat (Mus decumanus) succumb within a limited number of hours to a very virulent form of the disease, bovines suffering from the same malady derived from a similar source pass through a varying number of short paroxysms and prolonged intermissions, and concurrently become considerably emaciated. Eventually, after some months, these animals throw off the disease, and again attain a robust condition of body. 2. Surra in bovines appears to follow an identical course and present the same symptoms, whether the affected animals be stationed in the plains or at elevations of 1,800 feet and 7,500 feet above sea-level. 3. It would appear that the blood of bovines, after inoculation with the Surra Trypanosoma, must contain for a considerable period the organism or its immature form. For guinea-pigs inoculated with the blood from an animal (Bull I), on the 76th and 154th days of an inter- mission, respectively, succumbed to the disease, although no hæmatozoa could be discovered in the inoculated blood. Animals of the same species succumbed after passing through a period of incubation lasting 14 days when inoculated with blood from an animal (Bull III), taken on the 18th day of an intermission. 4. Bovines when inoculated with blood containing the Surra Trypanosoma, primarily derived from either the horse or rat, present during a varying period (5 to 14 days) a considerable amount of swelling and 70 The following horses submitted by the Veterinary Assistants as suspected cases of Surra were the subjects of either light-red conjunctival petechiæ or had a rise of body temperature. Microscopical examination of the blood revealed the following results:71 The question which then presented itself for solution was whether the Trypanosoma is ever to be found in stagnant or other waters, in the body fluids of flies, ticks or fish (i) during the hot season of the years, when no cases of Surra exist. (ii) during the early part of the rains before the disease has manifested itself in animals ? Since 1891, I have diligently searched during each season of the year to discover whether the Trypanosoma is present under any of the above conditions. One point has been settled, viz., that the organisms in the blood of certain fish are present in greatest numbers, during May and June, the hottest months of the year, but decrease or absent themselves after the rains have fairly set in. Since the transference of the Laboratory from the Deccan to Muktesar within easy reach of the North-Western Provinces and Punjab, the home of Surra, where each year opportunities are forthcoming for studying the etiology of the disease, I deter- mined to thoroughly investigate this question. In order to elucidate the above problem it would be necessary to visit the localities known to be Surra centres72 It is needless to enumerate the numerous forms of infusoria and organic life observed in the different waters submitted to microscopical examination. Suffice it to state that no Trypanosoma were discovered.73 Depôt Pond. A large variety of hæmatozoon was present in the blood of six specimens of this species of fish examined. Old Jumna River. The large variety of hæmatozoon was found in the blood of three fish examined. Singhi or Tinghi.74 Filariasis-. 4. During the microscopical examination of the blood of the various species of fish, the ' Chachari' obtained from stagnant water, on Remount Depot Estate, supplied the most un- expected results, the circulation of one specimen literally teeming with a small variety of hæmatozoa, while in several other specimens the organisms were noted as swarming. 5. Two horses posted in stables at the Mohand Pass were discovered to be the subjects of the Filaria papillosa. Three horses at Karnal exhibited symptoms of partial paralysis in one of which, an acute case, the paralysis became complete and death followed with hyperpyrexia. In the circulation of this animal numerous Embryo filaria were observed microscopically. Two bullocks out of thirty examined exhibited the Filaria in their circulation, 126 worms being found in four specimens of blood derived from one and 60 in the other, or a ratio per specimen of 31.5 and 15, respectively. The complete recovery of Bullock which was the subject of Surra, Filariasis, and Intermit- tent fever in December 1895. Karnal. 2. Rainy Season Tour. On September 7th, 1896,I arrived at Saharanpur and proceeded to the Mohand Pass. where in 1894 over 80 horses succumbed to Surra. The blood of some 135 horses in all, stationed at Mohand, Tunbara, Landibara and Asarori was subjected to microscopical examination, but only two animals were found to be the subjects of Surra and these at the latter station.* The infected animals, brought from the North Punjab, were the property of the European Firm of Dak proprietors, who have for several years past taken the precaution to boil the water before giving it to their animals in this locality. The fodder issued by this firm is dry grass, collected during the cold season, November to January, from high ground ; the corn in the form of oats is likewise cleaned and screened. The stables at Asarori are situated on the banks of a river, at an elevation of 3,000 feet, about half a mile from the crest of the north-eastern slope of the outer range of the Siwaliks. Although little or no rain in comparison with other seasons has fallen between Saharanpur and Landibara, the last chowki near the summit of the outer Siwaliks range, nevertheless the normal quantity has fallen this season between Asarori and Rajpur to the north-east* The stables at Asarori, where the majority of the animals belonging to the native owners are quartered, are nearly on a level with the bed of the river and the ground is swampy. On the other hand the European firm have constructed their buildings on the highest available site above the road, and introduced the above mentioned precautionary measures ; nevertheless the only equines affected with Surra on the 49 miles of road between Saharanpur and Rajpur up to September 9th were two of the eight horses stationed at Asarori, 3,000 feet elevation, which were thought to be protected from the insanitary surroundings. At Saharanpur similar investigations to those previously recorded during my hot season tour were made, but the results proved negative. The microscopical observations regarding water, blood of fish, flies and ticks made during my tour in the hot season were repeated in detail during this visit. Water.75 Mohand Pass. Kathgodam. Mohand Pass. Karnal. The blood of one hundred and thirty-five equines was submitted to microscopical examina- tion at the four stations of the Pass, with the following results :76 Several fairly large varieties of the Muscidæ have been caught on diseased animals, with their body cavities distended with blood, which, when submitted to microscopical examination, have been found to contain innumerable Trypanosoma, These flies up to the present have not been identified and placed in their respective species. At Poona the Surra animals, especially mules, and at the Surra camp at Karnal the horses were annoyed night and day by mosquitoes (Culicidæ), which were only kept in abey- ance by making fires to windward of the animals and allowing the smoke to envelope them. The following notes with regard to the above mentioned families of Diptera have been principally abstracted from the works of the Chief British and American authorities on this branch of science. The body fluids of flies obtained from every available source were submitted to microscop- ical examination. During a sojourn in a locality we engaged coolies to supplement our own staff; consequently fresh supplies of Diptera were brought in several times daily. These were carefully examined in the fresh state. In different districts one or other species of flies generally predominates, but they vary also in number and kind according to the season of the year. In the plains the commonest variety is the " louse fly " which infest horses, cattle, sheep and other animals, especially dogs. They belong to the family Hippoboscidæ, "head prone; neck lying on the prosternum", which is again sub-divided into six genera of which Hippo- bosca the first is frequently separated as a sub-order under the term Pupi-para, on account of the curious method of reproduction. Walker includes Hippoboscidæ under the Eproboscidæ, Loew and Sacken objected to uniting under the head of Brachycera, all those families which cannot be referred to the Nemocera, especially to the union of the Hipposcidæ with the other Brachycera, since both the history of their development and their internal and external anatomy essentially differ from them. These authorities include them under a third section, Coriacea, co-ordinate to the Nemocera and Brachycera and having the same systematic value. " The species of this family pass their egg-like and larva state in the body of the mother, and when born are pupæ, or larvæ just ready to assume the pupa state, as is proved by their size, which nearly equals that of the parent fly, by their slight motion when first extruded, by spiraculiform points which run down each side of them, and by their changing into perfect flies. Each female produces a single egg. The proboscis consists of a pair of hairy coriaceous valves, which include a very slender rigid tube or siphuncle, the instrument of suction, which is found by the union of two setiform pieces."77 marshy places. The flight is powerful; the males frequent flowers, the females with their sharp mouths pierce the skins and feed on the blood of quadrupeds. In England the Ox-Gad-fly, T. bovinus, is the most common variety, but in the United States T. atratus is a common species, while the T. cinctus, orange-belted Horse-fly, is smaller and. less abundant. The T. lineola, as in India, is the most common American species, " thousands of them appearing in the hotter parts of the summer, when the sun is shining on the marshes and western prairies ; horses and cattle are sometimes worried to death by their harassing bites. In cloudy weather they do not fly and they perish on the cool frosty night of September." (Packard) Walsh has shown that in its larval state the Horse-fly is useful to man as it feeds on snails and prob- ably the larvæ of other root eating insects. The larvæ of other species are aquatic, living under submerged objects. The family Muscidæ is the largest in number of genera and species in the order as well as the most difficult to classify. The common ' House-fly ' " the Blue bottle " and the " Flesh-fly " are examples and may be considered as typical forms, which most of the species resemble, not necessarily in colour or markings, but in general type of structure.

Rinderpest.; 2 On receipt of your letter No. 4743 (c) to protect animals against Rinderpest by the subcutaneous injection of bile, and other modified processes. A full report was submitted under my covering letter No. 115, dated Muktesar, August 5th, 1897. Embodying the various prophylactic measures adopted by Professor Koch4 15. On September 4th, the Inspector General issued orders to the Superin- tendents, Civil Veterinary Departments, North-Western Provinces and North and South Punjab, to report all outbreaks of Rinderpest in their province or circle direct to the Imperial Bacteriologist. This information was conveyed in Ins- pector General's No. 12145 Again referring to Appendix III, it will be observed that in January telegrams were sent to the Superintendents, Civil Veterinary Department, North-Western Provinces and South Punjab, with regard to report fresh out- breaks of Rinderpest. On receiving information from these officers in February, the district authorities were resorted to; their replies were almost of a nega- tive character. At last the outbreak reported by the Collector of Benares seemed promising and preparations were made to visit that locality. 21. Benares, Cawnpur, Lucknow Tour.6 will involve." Further the Inspector General was requested to prepare, in con- sultation with the Imperial Bacteriologist, a detailed plan for the consideration of Government. On November 18th, a correspondence was entered into with the Collector of Bareilly7 of the year and scarcity of water, and the long distance from which it has to be carried, great difficulty is experienced in refilling the tank. It is, therefore, not improbable that the necessary quantity of water will not be forthcoming until the monsoon season in June. 29. An estimate was submitted by the Engineer in March 1897, for some ten items, of which the most important were (i) a small house for sterilizing purposes, (ii) the incinerator, (iii) water to be laid on to the healthy cow sheds at Ritani, (iv) wood-shed. In June of the same year a second estimate was furnished for the same works, and at a later date the several works were taken in hand. 30. (i) Sterilizing House.8 35. Engineers.9 40.

Definition.19 aqueous humour loses its transparency and assumes a milky tint, the cornea becomes thickened and gradually opaque ; then the inflammatory phenomena subside, but vision is destroyed. In exceptionable cases a small quantity of blood may escape into the anterior chamber. Accord- ing to Spooner-Hart " the opacity of the cornea arising from the presence of a worm differs from that resulting from an injury which is always thickest at the immediate seat of the trouble or blow; whereas an opacity arising from the presence of a worm is evenly diffused all over the cornea and is regularly characteristic and diagnostic. In the early stages of the tenancy of the worm the opacity is thin and pale, and as already mentioned, after a time, becomes dense and presents a sort of marbled appearance. In the early stages the opacity may clear just as quickly as it comes on; as the worm shifts from the front to the back of the iris, and the irritation is further removed from the cornea, it clears up ; but as can be readily understood, this is not capable of frequent repetition. In addition to opacity of the cornea, there is lachrymation and more or less constant spasmodic twitching (blepharospasmus) of the upper lid, which in some instances may be in a half-drooping condi- tion ; but, as a rule, there is little intolerance of light." Adams states that he has met with cases in which for several days there has been a general weakness of the eye and an intolerance of light before the worm became visible. Opacity he says is a very frequent but not a constant complication ; it generally clears up after operation; if, however, the opacity is well marked before puncture of the cornea is performed, it may never clear at all. This officer mentions a case of some interest where the worm had been present for about three weeks before the horse was sent to him, there was no excessive opacity of the cornea, but the sight was injured and the humours of the eye were dimmed. The worm was removed and the horse sent back to its owner, who stated that, although for a long time the cornea appeared dull, it eventually became quite transparent again. As a rule, only one eye is affected and one filaria present, but cases have occurred where as many as three worms have been observed in the same organ at the same time. Hart mentions that " he removed a worm, and it was followed by another in the same eye a fort- night later." Further, on another occasion " he removed one in the near eye, and it was followed by one in the off eye."

Karnal. The Depôt Estate, situated at Karnal, Lower Punjab, 809 feet elevation above sea level, contains some 3,000 acres of land, and was part of one continuous plain, and, for years, has been intersected by roads, but the soil and conditions were nearly the same throughout. In some portions of the Estate, especially Paddock No. II, it was subjected to inundation during the rains, the land being water-logged and boggy, where grasses of the rankest description thrived. There were several ponds about the Estate, but the largest and most important in connection with this report was in Paddock No. II. Some portions of the land are reserved for green fodder crops grown under irrigation, the water being conveyed by Rajbahas direct from the West Jumna Canal. Between 1892 and 1896, inclusive, the number of country-bred, horses in the depôt varied between 624 and 860. But from the end of 1896 or beginning of 1897, all country- breds not issued were sent to the Government Depôt at Hopur, North-Western Provinces, and Karnal became a depôt for Australian horses like Saharanpur. Owing to an outbreak of Surra, Filariasis and fever, towards the end of the year 1895, a special report was written which embodied certain suggestions, with a view to improve the health of the stock by rendering the Estate more sanitary. Early in 1896, the stagnant ponds were filled up and enclosed and efforts made to drain the worst localities. The following is a list, giving details concerning fifty-one cases of ' worm in the eye at Karnal.

The last three months of the year are fine, and Karnal is possessed of an excessively pleasant cold season. Now it will be noticed, on reference to Table No. II, that it is during the intense heat of April, May and the greater part or the whole of the rainy season that the Filaria is never observed, but its presence was, in 97 per cent. of the cases recorded, entirely restricted to the cool and cold months, October25 TABLE IV.

Cured 2 1257 26 No. 1536.27 As at Karnal so at this depôt the maximum number of cases of Filaria Oculi, viz., eight (8) in 1895 occurred after a season of heavy rainfall amounting to 60.34 inches. But, on the other hand, five cases were observed in the cold season of 1897, with only 27.74 inches during the water-famine year; and one case only was operated upon in 1893, when 47.49 inches of rain fell. Consequently it would appear that a warm humid atmosphere is most advantageous to the development of the parasite. For the information of readers non-resident in India, it must be noted that by far the greater part of the rainfall of this country is brought by the summer-monsoon over a great part of Western India, including nearly the whole of the Bombay Presidency. It is only during this season, viz., June to October, that there is any rain of importance. This is the chief season of rainfall in Burmah, Assam, Bengal, North-Western Provinces, greater part of the Punjab, Central India, Rajputana, and the Central Provinces, Hyderabad, the Deccan, Berar, Guzerat and the whole of the west coast of the Peninsula. But the south-east of the Peninsula, including the Carnatic and the Eastern Ghats and the eastern half of Ceylon, receive only an occasional shower, so long as the main body of the monsoon is directed towards Northern and Central India, and their season of heaviest rainfall comes later, viz., from Oc- tober to December, when north-east winds are beginning to blow in the north-west of the Bay. As the heaviest rainfall occurs in the Madras district during the last quarter of the year, one would expect that the Filaria Oculi would make its appearance during January to May in each year, and this is what does happen. Length of time stationed in the locality before being affected with Falaria Oculi. On reference to the above table, it will be observed that of the twenty-one horses affected with " worm in the eye" which occurred at Saharanpur Depôt between the years 1893 to 1897, inclusive, 14 or 66.6 per cent. were Austra- lians and 7 or 3.33 per cent., Country-Breds. The average period which elapsed between the date of purchase and admission to hospital for Filaria Oculi varied in the case of the former animals between one and three years, or a mean of eighteen months and six days each. As the date of birth of the country-bred animals is not forthcoming, it is impossible to draw any deductions with regard to the period which elapsed between birth and the appear- ance of the parasite. As far as I am aware only two helminthologists have described the microscopical appear- ances of the Filaræ extracted from the anterior chamber of the eye of the horse. Davaine, who received his specimens from the Madras Presidency, gives them the following characters :28 observed between the appearances of the Filaria Oculi and Filaria Equina are to be explained by a consideration of the changes through which the immature worm must pass before the adult stage is reached. The author points out that according to Davaine and his own investigations the female is only slightly longer than the male; whilst the specimen described by Rivolta was 50 mm. in length, the male of the Filaria Equina is only two-thirds the length of the female. The aqueous humour, therefore, affects one more than the other, and is to be observed that the ovaries are destitute of eggs. The cephalic extremity of the male is better developed than that of the female. It is further to be observed that although among nematodes and other worms, the females preponderate as regards both number and size, the specimens of the Filaria Oculi show an unusual number of males, whereas in the adult worm (Filaria- Equina) females are numerous and filled with embryos. The aqueous humour, therefore, not only favors the male, but retards growth of the female ; the embryonic condition of the worm may account for the condition of the ovaries. " It would therefore appear from the accounts given by the before-mentioned helmintholo- gists that only one species of worm was discovered' amongst the specimens forwarded to them for examination from Madras and Calcutta respectively.

The body is tranvsersely striated, the cross markings commence 0.360 mm. from the buccal orifice and the first ten measure 0.172 m.m. the intervening spaces varying in width between 0.0160 and 0.024 m m. On microscopical examination of the specimens it is at once observed that one has to do with a totally different species, to the thread like worms previously described; the body is more or less flat and presents the appearance of a piece of tape, the head instead of being markedly attenuated towards the mouth, is wide and somewhat resembles that of a flat fish in contour, the cuticle is more or less regularly serrated and the mouth centrally placed, projects and is not guarded by lips in No.X, but occupies the centre of a transparent chitinous setting, the round apperture measuring 0.018 mm. in diameter. Both parasites are pigmented, the caudal extremity of No. VIII being quite black, with the exception of the cuticle which is transparent, but in both it is difficult to make out the course of the 32 TABLE VII.

General Remarks. 1. Officers in charge of the Laboratory during the year.2 This work has been steadily pursued, and in consequence of its requiring my constant attention, I have not been able to undertake any extensive tours to investigate the other important diseases which demand attention. I was only absent from the Laboratory for three days in December, to meet the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western Provinces with regard to the scheme for the establishment of the experimental depôt at Bareilly ; for five days in January to meet the Plague Commissioners at Agra with reference to their application for me to be allowed to visit on their behalf any outbreaks of Sunjar or Mahamari in Kumaon Hills which might be reported ; and for five days in February visiting an outbreak of so-called Sunjar some 60 miles from the Laboratory by road, which I was able to identify with relapsing or Famine fever, and to find the spirillum of this disease in the blood of a case. A report on this subject will be supplied to the Plague Commissioners. During the interval between the departure of Dr. Lingard from the Laboratory and the arrival of his successor, the Assistant Bacteriologist carried on the duties, and took advantage of this interval to have the Laboratory thoroughly cleaned and whitewashed, which apparently had not been done since it was built four years ago. He also isolated an organism from the blood of a horse which had died at Rawalpindi and which had been sent for examin- ation to the Laboratory, but it proved not to be pathogenic when tested on Laboratory animals. Work on Surra was also continued. December was occupied in completing the cleaning of the Laboratory and in going through all the stores, etc., to see what would be required to be ordered for the rinderpest work, and in setting up and getting into working order a quantity of new apparatus which had just been received from. Europe. Much time had also to be spent in reading up all the recent literature on the subjects which were being taken up this year. 3. Journal of the Journeys undertaken during 1898-99.3 To join new appointment :4 of any important experiments being repeated, when necessary, in the plains under different conditions to those which obtain at Muktesar and for other purposes, and it is hoped that necessary money will be allotted in time for the buildings to be completed before the cold weather, as the land has already been taken over, with the sanction of His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western Provinces, who kindly granted me an interview on the subject at Bareilly in January last. The site which has been selected is situated four miles out of Bareilly on the Badaun Road, and is about twelve acres in extent. One laboratory room, with a quarter for a Veterinary Assistant and a godown, will be constructed, together with sheds, which will suffice for cattle for rinder- pest experiments, if it is found necessary to repeat these on plain cattle there in the cold weather, or for horses or other animals if required. The officers of the Laboratory will either live in Bareilly or camp on the ground when working at this branch station. 6. Minor Improvements.5 last winter more land was cleared at Ritani, and 39 maunds of Jowar seed from Babugarh has been obtained and put in partly at Ritani and partly at Muktesar, and is coming up well. The ploughing is done by the experimental cattle, while the Jamadar supervises all the cultivation under the guidance of the Assistant Bacteriologist, to whom great credit is due for his work in develop- ing the cultivation. A small quantity of several hill crops are being tried as an experiment on some of the Laboratory land, so that any which are successful and suitable for fodder in place of grass, which is only obtainable with great difficulty, will be planted more extensively next year. 10. Reservation of the Muktesar Forest.6 station will be visited in order to allow of investigations being carried on there. Unfortunately the disease usually runs a course of but a few hours, so that it is impossible to get from the Laboratory to Roorkee after a case has been reported in time to see it; but if in the course of the cold weather work is being carried on at the Bareilly branch, it may then be possible to do so. As it has been reported from South Africa that a fungus has been found which will readily kill off swarms of locusts, steps have been taken to obtain some of the material for the Laboratory, and it is hoped that it will shortly be received and kept growing here ready to be sent out if required. Although this pest is not so severe in India as in Africa, yet it at times causes great havoc, and the method appears to be worthy of a trial.* The preparation of tetanus anti-toxine has also been commenced, two horses having been obtained for the purpose and the injections have been begun. The process, however, takes several months to carry through, but the recent dis- covery of its much more powerful curative value when it is injected directly into the brain, over the previous method of its sub-cutaneous administration, greatly enhances the value of the material, and it is hoped that it will be ready for issue in a few months' time. The testing of the spinal cords of dogs which are thought to have died of hydrophobia and which may be forwarded to the Laboratory for that purpose is being arranged for. Preliminary Note on Rinderpest Experiments. 12. Brief resumé of recent work on the Subject.7 and eighth days of the disease. A local swelling forms at the seat of the inoculation, which is slowly absorbed, and ten days after the injection the animal is found to be immune to the disease. The duration of this immunity is very variable, being occasionally only of some three weeks' duration, and its average, as a result of many thousand inoculations in South Africa, has been found to be about four months. As, moreover, it was found impossible after the bile method to use other methods of producing a permanent immunity in the same animal, the method has been abandoned in South Africa in favour of others which produce a much longer or a permanent immunity. The bile was also found in the experience of most authors to actually originate the disease in some instances. 14. The Glycerineated bile method of Dr. Edington.8 preventive measures had been discovered, 90 per cent. of the whole of the cattle of South Africa would have been carried off within a very short time,9 a very slight attack of the disease with a sufficiently long consequent immunity, will be best suited to the conditions met with in this country; especially as the protection will be obtained in a very few days. Moreover, the serum in larger doses can be used as a curative measure in early cases of the disease, if a suffi- cient quantity is available,10 Indian Hill cattle, but it will have to be tested on the less susceptible Plains ones in whom it may possibly give better results. As, however, in point of susceptibility to the disease the Indian Hill cattle are more on a par with the South Africa animals than are the Indian Plains cattle, the results so far obtained are disappointing, and it appears to be an example of the differences among various breeds of cattle with regard to the ease or difficulty of affording them protection from the disease by various methods. 21. Liver extracts.-11 and kept at the room temperature, which at that time was only from 4° to 10° centigrade. Some of the same blood was put up in a similar tube from which the air was not expelled before it was sealed up. In the first experiment, blood which had been thus put up four days after it was obtained from the animal and kept for eleven days more under the same conditions was used, and both that in hydrogen and the control blood in air produced a severe and fatal attack of the disease. In a second experiment, with the same blood which had been kept under the conditions noted for twenty days, the result was negative, but in a third series, blood which had been put up in hydrogen for nineteen days caused a severe and fatal attack of rinderpest when injected subcutaneously, but some of the same blood which had been sealed up without removing the air gave the same result. It appears, then, that hydrogen gas had no effect either in preserving or in attenuating the virus over ordinary air. The length of time which the blood remained virulent was also uncertain, but might be considerable, and as it has recently been found that difficulty is sometimes met with in villages in getting the consent of the people to allow the small quantity of virulent blood that is required for the simultaneous method of inoculation to be taken from any of their sick cattle, these experiments will be continued ; for, if a method of pre- serving the virus for two or three weeks without loss of virulence can be dis- covered, it may be found possible to keep such a supply of virulent material at the Bareilly Experimental Station when that place is completed. Dried rinder- pest blood is also being tested. 24. Inoculation of blood from animals in different stages of salting.12 out buildings of the Laboratory were practically completed, and four salted animals, which had recovered from an attack of the disease at the time of the experiments made when Professor Koch visited the Laboratory 18 months before, were available for the purpose, and were inoculated with increasing doses of virulent blood until 1,000 c.c. were given at once, and were then bled for the production of serum and reinoculated again with still larger doses, in accordance with the details described by Turner and Kolle. Subsequently, some of the serum obtained from one of these was used for passing six more animals through a mild attack of the disease, and these too were then inocu- lated in the same way as the first series and serum obtained from them, so that at the present date some 30,000 c.c. of serum have been made. When a centrifugal machine, which has been ordered, reaches the Laboratory, more than twice as much serum will be able to be prepared from the same quantity of blood as is at present possible. It is worthy of note that in all our first bleed- ings only from 11 to 15 per cent. of serum was obtained from the blood taken, which was very disappointing. As it seemed probable that the quantity that separates from the clotted blood would depend on the firmness of the clot itself more than on any other factor, and as, moreover, it is known that the clotting power of the blood can be very materially increased by the adminis- tration of Calcium Chloride, it was determined to administer this drug before bleeding the animals. The result was most satisfactory, as in this way from 30 to 40 per cent. of serum was obtained, and the great difference between the quantity obtained from animals with and without the use of the drug was repeatedly verified, as different animals were found to give different quantities of serum. Moreover, it was found that a greater quantity of serum was obtained by the use of two doses, each of half an ounce, one given the evening before and the other on the same morning as the bleeding but some three hours before, than by a single dose given on the same morning as the blood was taken. All our animals are now treated in this way, and there is no evidence to show that the quality of the serum is in any way affected by the drug, while, if anything, it might be expected to lessen the uticaria which some- times follows the injections of the serum. One other point of practical importance, which has been worked out in the course of these experiments on making serum, may be mentioned here. The main difficulty in carrying it out is that of obtaining of large quantities of virulent blood, for which purpose control animals have to be inoculated and sub- sequently bled when the disease has fully developed. As, for the sake of economy, the small Hill cattle are used for this purpose, it was found that only some 2,000 c.c. of blood could be obtained from the jugular vein of an animal before heart failure set in, the flow ceased, and the animal shortly after died. On the other hand, by bleeding from the carotid artery, only 3,000 c.c. were obtained, but the process was a peculiarly repulsive one, convulsions being caused. In South Africa very much larger animals are used, and although they are bled to death a very much larger quantity of blood is obtained from one animal, and the process does not require to be repeated nearly so often as would be the case when Hill cattle are used in India. Moreover, on account of the sacredness of cattle in India, it is eminently desirable to avoid bleeding this animal to death, but if the amount taken is so regulated as to allow of the animal going back to his stall and living for a time at least, but very little blood is obtained and the number of animals sacrificed is greatly increased. Fortunately, a method of overcoming both these objections has been put up into pratice with most satisfactory results. It consists simply in the injection into the jugular vein, after taking as much blood as is required, of an equal quantity of sterilised salt solution of the same specific gravity as the blood itself, such as is used in the case of transfusion after severe h13 for the process could be repeated a third time, or larger quantities taken the second time if thought advisable, and at the same time the slaughter of the animal if avoided. This method has considerably reduced our difficulties in preparing large quantities of serum, and at the same time has lessened consider- ably the number of animals which it has been necessary to inoculate with the disease for the purpose of obtaining virulent blood. 26. Testing the strength of the Serum.14 If this experience is confirmed in future outbreaks, the method here adop- ted15 (2) Salting the hides, for which purpose common salt is used in many places, and especially in the Punjab, while in Bengal and also in the North-Western Provinces "Khari," which consists of Sodium Sulphate with a little Magnesium Sulphate and a very small quantity of Sodium Chloride, is largely used instead of common salt, although less so than was formerly the case. This last material has the advantage of being less deliquescent than com- mon salt, so that the hides dry more quickly, and for this reason it is pretty certain that hides cured with ordinary salt would contain the infection a little longer, if anything, than the Khari- treated ones, and if the former is sufficient to render the skins inocuous, the latter will have the same effect. (3) The third process consists in the use of Chunam (lime) which is rubbed into the skin just as salt is. The details of these methods differ very slightly in different provinces. Thus, in Calcutta, the skins are often dried with or without the addition of salt or lime, then dipped into a bath of salt and lime, and finally dried once more. Another process is also largely used there at the present time, which consists of placing skins, which have been dried in the sun without the addition of any ingredient, in a bath of arsenic and ammonia or soda for a few minutes, and then drying them again, the arsenic remaining in the skin and protecting it from the ravages of insects, for which purpose it is used and not as an antiseptic. Arsenic is also largely used by European dealers in the North-Western Provinces, but here again the skins are first dried in the sun, so that, if that alone proves sufficient to prevent all danger of infection, it will not be necessary to test the action of arsenic on the contagion. In Bombay, nearly all the skins are tanned after salting or drying, while in Madras they are either tanned straight away while fresh, or, if they have to be kept more than 24 hours, they are first treated with lime or salt. Raw hides in this province are dried in the sun. At Karachi the skins are either dried in the sun for two days or treated with arsenic and then sun-dried. In the North- Western Provinces, between October and May, the skins are sun-dried on bamboo frames, while from June to Sep- tember they are salted, usually with Khari salt from Patna. Those which are taken from dead animals are sun-dried. In Western Bengal they are either sun-dried or treated with Khari, while in Lower Bengal the latter process is largely used. It will then be evident that, in order to ascertain whether there is any danger of rinderpest being carried about India or to other countries through the export of the hides of animals that have died of rinderpest, it will be necessary to find out how long the infection remains in the hides of animals, that have died of this disease, when they are either dried in the sun or shade, or treated with salt or lime, and with this object in view the following experi- ments were made. 30. Methods of carrying out the experiments.16 carried on in one in which cases of the disease had occurred, and although careful disinfection was carried out, in some instances the animals became infected from others in the same shed, mostly at a date which was beyond the incubation period of the disease, so that it was certain that the infection was here a natural one, caught from the infected sheds and not from the skins which were being tested, and only proved that the animal was susceptible to the disease and yet had failed to get it from the skin injections within the extreme known incubation period of the disease. I should also mention that all of the animals which did not get the disease from the skins were sub- sequently injected with virulent blood and proved to be susceptible by their contracting the disease in every case except one, and this solitary exception was also given at the same time a large dose of protective serum, which was sufficient to prevent him contracting the disease. In every fatal case the diagnosis I was confirmed by a post mortem examination. Moreover, all the cases which natural infection followed the skins injections in the infected shed were subsequently controlled by a final experiment in a shed in which no cases of rinderpest had ever occurred. The temperatures, pulse and respira- tions of all the animals were taken twice a day and recorded on a chart, together with the symptoms for ten days after the injection, while the extreme incuba- tion period of the disease mentioned in the reports from South Africa is eight days, and I have never seen it to be as long as that in any animals tested in this Laboratory. The animals used were all Hill cattle, which I find are much susceptible to the disease than Plains animals. The sun temperature at the place where the skins were being dried was recorded with a solar radiation thermometer three times a day, and the shade maximum and minimum temperatures were also recorded together with other meteorological data, and it will be seen from the records given with the experiments that these tem- peratures are lower than would be likely to be met with in most Plains stations at any time of the year, so that the length of time that was found necessary in the different processes for the destruction of virus in the hides tested at Muktesar will be at least as long as, if not longer than, would be required in the Plains, so that the results obtained here may reasonably be held to apply to all those parts of India in which there is any material trade in hides. The experiments were carried out in three series, the first of which only applied to dried skins and were undertaken to get a general idea as to the probable duration of the infection, while, as the skins had been kept in the post mortem house until shortly before they were used, which is, perhaps, the most infected spot in the place, it was recognised that some of them might have become recently reinfected from the place where they had been kept, and the test was of more negative than positive value. The second series was carried out with skins that had been treated by a professional native Chamar (hide curer) with skins which were kept in an uninfected room and hung up separately from each other. The third series were carried out in the same way as the second series, only in an uninfected shed. The results of each experiment will now be briefly recorded. FIRST SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS. 31.

It is evident, then, that under the most favourabe circumstances it is scarcely possible for the infection of rinderpest to be carried by means of the skins of animals that have died of the disease for more than a very short dis- tance, and that it is quite impossible that Indian hides, treated in any of the usual ways which are adopted in various parts of the country, could convey the infection of the disease to any country outside India through the exportation of raw untanned hides, and much more would it be impossible for those which had been passed through the lengthy and arduous process of tanning to so carry such infection. 34. Infection in Bones.21 Result.22 his suffering from the disease. Now that it has been discovered that the virus can be preserved in the marrow of a long bone, even when the outside has been rendered non-infectious by exposing it to the sun for some days, it is evident that it will only be necessary to send such a bone to the place where virus is wanted, and to inoculate an animal from it. This method I hope to test in actual practice very shortly. LEONARD ROGERS, M.D., M.R.C.P., B.S., F.R.C.S., Captain, I.M.S., Officiating Imperial Bacteriologist, G. I. C. P.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGIST FOR THE YEAR 1899-1900. General Remarks. Officers in charge of the laboratory during the year.2 appeared after the inoculations with serum. He further expressed himself in the following words : " A great number of people now of the same and some other villages are willing to have their cattle inoculated." (iii) A third tour to Orai, North-Western Provinces, between the 8th and 16th July, but the disease was found to have abated on the officiating Imperial Bacteriologist's arrival. (iv) During the latter half of July, Captain Rogers proceeded to Pithora- garh, at the request of the missionaries resident in that locality, in order to inoculate their cattle with protective rinderpest serum. Advantage was taken at the same time of testing the serum method on hill cattle, as an outbreak occurred in the vicinity during his halt. Result.3 3.

As a full report was furnished to the Government of India by the officiating Imperial Bacteriologist, Captain L. Rogers, M.D., I.M.S., on September 29th, 1899, it will be unnecessary for me to again bring the details of the occurrence to notice. The site for the Laboratory was selected in August 1893, but it was not until June 1895 that the fitting up of the interior of the building was commenced. The furniture and fittings were manufactured in this country, but the scientific and chemi- cal apparatus were gradually acquired according to the Budget grant accorded by Government for the purpose, each year; consequently the Laboratory was not in working order until late on in the year 1898, at the time of my removal to the Ramsay Hospital, Naini Tal. All office records together with most of the books and periodicals in the Laboratory Library on the ground floor were saved, also a small percentage of the glass-ware, apparatus and stores which could be handed out through the windows on the basement level. Mr. Kriebel at great risk to himself salvaged some of the photographic apparatus and microscopical stands from the burning upper storey, but luckily relaxed his efforts shortly before the roof fell in. A rough estimate of the loss sustained by Government, excluding the cost of the building, was returned by the above- mentioned officer, as about R8,000. Having ordered all the apparatus, etc., during the years 1890 to 1898 inclusive, I am in a position to state that R14,000 would be much nearer the exact figure than R8,000. Up to the present the results of many years' investigation with regard to the different varieties of Trypanosoma discovered in this country have remained unpublished, the descriptions recorded having been kept back until Volume III of the Surra report was completed. It is, therefore, a regretable fact that the following records deposited in a tin case in the Imperial Bacteriologist's private room on the upper floor together with cabinets containing microsco- pical specimens on the upper floor, were destroyed in the general conflagra- tion :7 world probably at 7,500 feet elevation. Exactly a year later the unfortunate conflagration took place, which destroyed in three hours the work of six anxious years. Since 1890, when work was commenced in Poona, the annual grant for apparatus and chemicals had been expended with caution so as to allow of all necessary appliances being obtained according to the need of each respectively. So that during the years 1890-99, a very valuable collection had been brought together. Nearly the whole stock of chemicals purchased from the grants of each year since 1896, were destroyed. 8. The Library.8 additions are :9 the feed and keep of cattle. The barley, which was sown at the end of Sep- tember 1898, can be described as having been a fairly successful crop, though a good deal of damage was done to the ears by birds and hail. Seven maunds twelve seers of barley seed were sown and the resultant was fifty maunds, four seers of grain and 70 maunds, 34 seers of bhoosa. The bhoosa, in particular, was very useful coming as it did in May when the hay supply was exhausted. The land which had been cleared at Ritani during the winter was sown with jowar and a quantity of this seed was also sown at Muktesar and Surmanes- war. From 36 maunds of jowar planted 416 maunds of dry straw (Churry) were obtained, this latter was the staple food of the Laboratory cattle during the last winter and work could not have progressed without it. However, both it and the grass collected, will be finished by the middle of April and after that the cattle will have to be fed on young oak leaves instead of grass. It should be mentioned that, in addition to churry, grass or oak shoots, the cattle are accustomed to get a ration of grain. Only 16 seers of grain were collected from the jowar. At this elevation, jowar does not produce much grain but the main endeavour is to get plenty of straw for use as fodder. This churry takes the place of grass which is so difficult to obtain in any quantity in this locality ; as a forage it is preferable to the grass grown near Muktesar. A small quantity of Mandwa seed was also sown last summer : 14 seers of seed produced 6 maunds of grain and 40 maunds of straw. Mandwa (Gleusine coracana) is grown largely in the locality and does well at Muktesar (7,500). Its straw, however, is not of the same value as fodder for cattle as jowar (Sorghum vulgare) and the cattle do not care for it. It thrives best, however, at the lower elevation of Ritani (6,000 feet), and this year more ground having been cleared during the winter, the jowar crop will be confined to that locality. A small quantity of imphee seed has also been obtained for trial during the ensuing summer. It is hoped and expected that a good crop will result, and it makes a most excellent forage for cattle. The expense incurred in get- ting jowar and imphee seed to Muktesar is a serious item, but as the importance of fodder crops cannot be overestimated, it has to be met. It is unfortunate that sufficient seed cannot be obtained from the jowar crop to sow the follow- ing year, as in addition to the economical side of the question, the seed would probably get somewhat acclimatised and better crops result. The small quantity of jowar seed obtained last autumn will be sown and it will be noted if the crop from it is better than that from the imported seed. The winter crops, barley and oats were sown last autumn, owing partly to the drought and partly to the seed having been sown too late from scarcity of labour, the crops are poor. The oats both at Ritani and Muktesar may prove a fair crop though somewhat short in the straw, but the barley except for a few acres sown in season at Muktesar is quite a failure. The cattle have been allowed to eat the barley off the ground at Ritani and the land is being pre- pared for jowar. Owing to the scarcity of forage, the oats will probably have to be cut before they are ripe and given green. It has been practically decid- ed that instead of attempting to take two crops yearly off the land, the summer crops such as jowar, mandwa, etc., will be grown at Ritani where they thrive best and the winter crops barley, oats, etc., at Muktesar. This will give the labour an opportunity of utilizing all the available manure and working the land thoroughly in the interim. Arrangements were made last year to have the land under cultivation measured after the rains, but as all moneys available were taken for re-stocking the Laboratory after the fire, the idea was given up. This very necessary work will probably be done during the follow- ing summer." " During the rains (27th August to 11th September 1899), about 243 maunds of green grass was cut and put into a silo pit which had been prepared as an experiment. The silo was opened in February 1900 and although the upper portion of the ensilage was found to be mouldy and unfit for food, the lower portion turned out to be good and sweet ensilage, and was relished by the cattle. The experiment was therefore partially successful and if another year greater pressure is applied and that promptly, the preparation of ensilage can probably be made very successful."

Transfer of Muktesar Garden.11 Subsequently by Notification No. 6112 Unfortunately but two returns have been made by officers using the serum by the Simultaneous method, and I would suggest the advisability of Government issuing the necessary orders, so that the Imperial Bacteriologist may be made acquainted with the results of the issued serum in actual practice, as they are obtained. This would greatly facilitate the work at Muktesar, as well as adding to our knowledge of the effect of the prepared protective serum on different breeds of cattle far removed from the North- Western Provinces. The Superintendent of Civil Veterinary Department, Madras, reported on the 8,000 c.c. serum despatched from Muktesar on October 10th, 1899, as follows: "Out of 339 bullocks inoculated, 9 died, but these deaths were attributable to old age and debilitated condition and to the fact that the animals were suffering from rinderpest previous to inoculation." As the serum inoculations have been giving most satisfactory results, arrange- ments are being made to produce 50,000 doses or more, as Government may decide. The necessary requisitions for producing such a large quantity have been submitted to the Supreme Government. (d) Effect of salt and saji on bovines as a prophylactic against rinder- pest.13 Although a large number of tubes have been despatched to nearly all parts of India, including Native States, up to the present, no data have reached this office, on which to form an opinion as to the value of the method. South African observers note that experience has shown them that fungus does not act well in droughts. With arsenic in different forms, white arsenic or Paris green-made up according to different formulæ, successful results have been recorded. Mr. C. P. Lounsbury, Government Entomologist, writes as follows:14 (g) Tuberculine.15 During the past and present year Major A. W. Dawson, I.M.S., stationed at Roorkee, has been fortunate enough to observe the course of several cases and has made careful examinations of the bodies of those animals which succumbed. This officer found that the symptoms observed coincided with those attributable to Aconite poisoning ; and on subcutaneous injection of a dose of Aconite into an experimental animal produced the following chain of symptoms :16 occasions to Mallein, and that the pathological changes observed in the lungs, Post-mortem, were in the majority of instances pathognomonic of Glanders. On the evening of the 3rd March, in company with the Director, Army Remount Department (Colonel H. Goad), and Veterinary Lieutnant W. A. Pallin, I visited the segregation camp, Paddocks No III and IV outside the limits of the Depôt and found 13 animals consisting of 4 c.b. horses and 9 mules in the former and 6 in the latter, presenting small tumours and open wounds on different parts of the body, associated in some instances with swellings varying in size from a small walnut to that of a hen's egg, from which corded and beaded lymphatic vessels issued. Whilst in others tumours were observed which on manipulation were found hard and fluctuating according to the stage which they had attained. In the majority of cases the Lymphangitis had made its appear- ance on a level with a pre-existing wound of little importance, abrasion of the skin, or harness gall, etc., which had been healed for some time, may be for months, and had broken out afresh, on the original site or pustules appeared in close proximity to the cicatrix. In more advanced cases considerable areas of the skin covering the ribs, front of the chest, side of the head or limbs were involved, and one animal presented a fair sized ulcer (as large as a four anna piece) in the nose, situated on the mucous-membrane of the nasal septum, raised above the level of the surrounding tissue, edges crateriform, interior of chancre concave, granulations presenting a glazed waxy appearence, ab- sence of discharge, sub-maxillary glands not yet affected, abscess on angle of jaw externally, and corded lymphatics. On March 4th, 1900, microscopical exa- mination of pus collected from the sores of horses Nos. 231 and 612, inmates of No. III segregation paddock, large numbers of the " Cryptococcus " which produces the so-called Lymphangitis Epizootica, were discovered in each speci- men. These organisms were found free in the fluids under examination, as well as enclosed in the pus cells. At a later date, I systematically examined, with the aid of the microscope, material obtained from all the isolated animals in Nos. III and IV segregation paddocks, which presented either open or scabbed wounds with unmistakable cording and beading of the lymphatic vessels and on all suspicious cases of the disease. The following are the results obtained. Of 30 cases presenting suspicious symptoms, the material collected from 29 contained the Cryptococcus in varying numbers. On the 30th animal, as the pustules were only forming, no pus was obtainable, but as there was cord- ing and beading of the lymphatic vessels present, it was no doubt with regard to the diagnosis. It was suggested that all the animals in the Depôt, present- ing any wounds however small or insignificant should have material taken and submitted to microscopical examination, with a view to determine the presence or absence of the " Cryptococcus." Of material collected from 50 animals out of 400 odd, 5 animals only were found to present the organism of the disease in question. Numerous guinea pigs were inoculated by the intraperitoneal method with material obtained from animals suffering from the disease, and from one which had given a reaction to Mallein, but no symptoms of any kind have super- vened. If the Bacillus Mallei had been introduced into the peritoneum of the inoculated animals, orchitis or oophoritis would have supervened in the course of 2 to 3 days, followed by death from the 12th to 15th day. Of the 20 horses presenting the disease at the time of or since my visit to Hapur Remount Depôt, two animals only have shown a reaction when subject- ed to the Mallein (Pasteur's and MacFadyean's) test on three occasions at inter- vals of several months. In each instance17 (b) Mallein reacted in two only out of 40 cases. (c) Presence in large numbers of another organism, other than that of Glanders. (d) Absence of Bacillus Mallei, (i) on microscopical examination, (ii) on Cultivation experiments, (iii) on inoculation experiments. Diagnosis.18 dirty sponges, etc., which have been used in connection with previous cases of the disease, need not be gone into further in this note. Infected wounds fre- quently heal, and after the period of incubation, again break out followed by the usual enlargement of lymphatic vessels and form a beaded cord. The disease in Europe is nearly always curable in from one to seven months, when the disease is recognised, and an energetic treatment adopted in the early stages. In Naples 90 per cent. of cases are said to recover. Treat- ment consists in the excision, scraping out or cauterisation of the subcutaneous purulent foci as they appear. Before leaving Hapur Remount Depôt, through the courtesy of the Director, Army Remount Department, I was enabled to initiate a number of comparative experiments in bovines, buffaloes and smaller animals, with a view to determine to what extent they are susceptible to the epizootic in this country. I hope to have an opportunity of examining them previous to the autopsies at a latter date ; in the meantime these animals are all segregated a long distance outside the limits of the Remount Depôt and away from any habitation. (j) Surra.19 have succumbed to rinderpest, and the following table shows the Syngami found during different months of the year :20 commences in the Sheds soon after 6 A.M., winter and summer. The Centri- fugal Machine is in use from 8 A.M. to 6 P.M., worked by manual labour, four coolies being required to perform the task. It will thus be seen that all the members of the Establishment, including three clerks in the Office, are working at high pressure. Dunichand the laboratory draftsman, artist and photographer, who had been 5½ years at the Laboratory and whose services were invaluable and indis- pensable, left at the beginning of 1899, his assigned reason being " to better his position."

When a pregnant cow has passed through an attack of rinderpest without abortion or premature birth taking place at a later period brings forth a living calf, will the offspring have received protection against rinderpest ? The two animals utilized in this experiment were those used by Professor Koch whilst demonstrating his methods at Muktesar. After recovery from rinderpest they were respectively retained, with a view to determine the period during which they would remain immune from the disease.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGIST FOR THE YEAR 1900-1901. General Remarks. I remained in charge of the Laboratory during the year under review and Veterinary Lieutenant G. K. Walker held the post of Assistant Bacteriologist. 2. No inoculation work was done in the field by the officers of the Laboratory, and a greater part of their time was occupied in manufacturing anti-rinderpest serum and despatching it to the Superintendents of the Civil Veterinary Department and other officers who demanded it. Appendix I shows this in detail. 3. In addition to the serum manufacture, the following diseases were dealt with during the year :2 5. Mallein.3 16. Lymphangitis Epizootica is a disease which suddenly broke out as an epidemic in 1899, and as reported last year, puzzled many Veterinary officers and others, and caused much destruction of remount animals. It was imported by mules from Italy and is often called " Neapolitan Farcy." I submitted a preliminary report last April, in which general information and instructions were given. I have since then continued my diagnosis of the disease by investigating specimens of pus supplied to me from different parts of India and have collected material for a second report on the etiology of the disease, in which the results of my further investigations will be given. 17. Strangles causes loss to the Remount Department and was therefore brought on to my list. The diagnosis of the disease itself requires little or no study as its characteristics are well known, but the determination of the organism causing the disease has not been satisfactorily effected. III.4 of Government has been received to purchase an oil engine and a second centrifugal machine, and it is hoped that the next year's output will be larger. 26. Before any anti-rinderpest serum is issued from this laboratory, it is carefully tested as to its protective power. For this purpose animals are procured from the hills, Kumaun Division, and plains from the Bareilly District. As some doubt existed as to the protective power of the serum forwarded to the Jullunder and Hoshiarpur districts in July last, I suggested that the Superintendents, Civil Veterinary Department, of each Province should obtain a certain number of each breed of cattle found in their districts, and submit them in turn to experiment, first by the simultaneous method, and second by the serum alone method, in order to ascertain the doses of anti- rinderpest serum required to protect such different breeds. Otherwise, a few selected animals of each breed might be conveyed to the Imperial Bacteriolo- gical Laboratory Depôt at Bareilly as opportunity offers, and there submitted to the above tests. It must be remembered that in a vast continent like India, all breeds do not present the same degree of susceptibility to rinderpest as evidenced by the experience gained at Muktesar with regard to plains and hill animals. From information received, it would appear that animals located on lands adjoining large rivers are more susceptible and suffer from a more virulent form of rinderpest than those which are situated at a distance from such water. 27. During the year, it was decided by Government to train Veterinary Assistants of different District Boards, etc., at this Laboratory, (1) in the general principles of serum therapeutics, especially with regard to rinderpest; (2) bleeding of animals for virulent blood; (3) defibrinating blood; (4) pre- servation of virulent blood; (5) practical sterilisation of instruments, etc.; (6) manipulation of Koch's syringe. During December last, two Veterinary Assistants, Kotu Ram from Feroze- pur District Board and Agha Ali from Ulwar State, reported their arrival, and have now passed through the course. Accommodation is now provided at Muktesar for the continuous reception of four Veterinary Assistants at a time and their course is fixed for three months. Theoretically they are taught the principles of different immunising (rinderpest) methods, in addition to the practical course laid down for them as mentioned above. When trained, these Veterinary Assistants are the men who at a later date we shall have to rely upon to perform the preventive inoculations in the field under the supervision of their respective Veterinary Superintendents. 28. New Laboratory Buildings.5 agency existing consists of Veterinary Assistants only, who cannot be depended upon to do the inoculation work independently until they have been specially trained at this Laboratory. 31. A Conference was held in Simla on the 17th September 1900, at which it was decided to institute depôts for the reception of immunizing agents in each Province. To maintain a stock of serum at any local centre, the Local Governments should arrange to get the supply from this Labora- tory and start the inoculation work under the direct supervision of their Veterinary Superintendents, as long as the reputation of this curative agent is not thoroughly established. 32. The experiment to prove whether serum will keep indefinitely in any climate if kept under proper precautions is not yet finished. A certain quantity of it has been deposited in the Deputy Commissioner's office at Jacobabad, and will be sent for and tested when it has undergone an ex- posure to the highest temperature in that locality. VI.6 injected at the same time as the serum but on opposite sides of the body, and a modified form of rinderpest produced. 39. The Chief Commissariat Officer, Peshawar, reports that "on the 11th December 1900, rinderpest broke out amongst the slaughter cattle (cattle, 481 and sheep, 711) at Peshawar. From 11th to 25th December, 97 animals were destroyed or died. On the 22nd December a case of protective rinderpest serum was received from the Imperial Bacteriologist and the whole of the animals at the Jubba Jhil were inoculated on the 22nd, 23rd, 24th and 25th December 1900. From the 26th December 1900, to the 5th January 1901, thirteen animals died, after this date, the epidemic had actually ceased and no fresh cases occurred. The inoculation of the animals with the serum decidedly stopped the disease, as in addition to preventing the healthy animals from becoming affected, it also reduced the mortality amongst those that were already affected and the majority of which recovered. The benefit of the serum can also be seen in the death percentages both before and after the inoculation. Before inoculation 20.16 per cent., after inoculation 2.70 per cent. " It was also due to the serum that the sheep, which were kept in the same locality, were not affected. Just before the inoculation, they were taken out and segregated as suspicious but when inoculated did not develop rinderpest." 40. The results have thus shown such pronounced success as to justify the prosecution of urgent measures for wide action. 41. In the case of Lymphangitis Epizootica, I have made three personal inspections of the animals segregated for my observation at Hapur. The main results were that I determined the extremely long period of incubation in equines, and the comparative, if not complete, immunity of bovines, etc. A.

Cawnpore, Poona and Nagpore experiments.4 20 c.c., of anti-rinderpest serum will be ample to give protection by the "Serum alone" method for a period of several months. 13. Anthrax.5 considerable lesions were noted in the horses and mules, and ones of a slighter character, beneath the skin at or around the seat of inoculation, in the bovines; the "materies morbi" of this disease being frequently recognised by the microscope in the affected tissues. After an interval of 1 year and 9 months, at which date the animals were destroyed and the post-mortems conducted, no trace of the inoculated disease could be found and no lesions of the internal organs referable to the same were observed. 19. In conjunction with Veterinary Captain Cranford, Army Veterinary Department, experiments were undertaken to ascertain whether horses could contract the above mentioned disease, when " mutty" obtained from the standings of diseased animals was applied to the surface of granulating wounds. Three animals (equines) were used for these experiments: In the first experiment, the " mutty " was taken from the just vacated standing of a bad case of Lymphangitis Epizootica, and the result was positive. In the second and third, certain selected standings, previously occupied by severe cases of the above disease, were railed in and allowed to be exposed to the weather, during a period of two months, before the material was collected and smeared on the granulating surfaces. The granulating wounds were cleaned and smeared daily with " mutty " obtained from the above source, between 30th July and 7th September 1901. Although the second and third cases remained under daily observation for a period of eight months, no untoward symptoms resulted and no Lymphangitis Epizootica supervened. 20. Lymphangitis Epizootica has now become a generalized disease in many districts in India. On investigating the outbreaks at Hapur and Karnal Remount Depôts in 1900, affecting horses and mules, I traced the disease to previous cases imported from Italy, but in no way connected one with the other. During my visit to Hapur, 27th March 1902,I found two animals segregated in the confines of the depôt, only received from Lahore and Jacobabad fairs within a period of three weeks, the former to be suffering with well marked Lymphangitis Epizootica, in the tissues of which the Cryptococcus was demonstrated microscopically, and the latter presented every symptom of an early case. 21. Surra.6 three different courses, i.e., an acute, semi-acute and a chronic form. Most of our investigations were confined to the two latter, as the cases of the former were uncommon. Twenty-two autopsies were conducted, and experimental inoculations performed on equines, bovines, sheep and goats. Further, investi- gations were made with regard to the water and fodder supply, and the services of the Superintendent, Saharanpur Botanical Garden, were requisitioned as to the different diseases of the fodder crops, and complete specimens of the latter were forwarded to the Cryptogamic Botanist to the Government of India for examination and report. Much new light has been thrown on the causation of this disease, but as the question is of a most abstruse character, much close attention and observation is required to solve the problem, which will be con- tinued as opportunity offers. The Director, Army Remount Department, has been requested to initiate certain experiments this season, at Karnal, in order to elucidate whether the well water is at fault. 25.

All Burmans were asked as a favour to report anything to me personally or to Township Officers, but no reports or complaints were received. I was equally successful with the " Simultaneous method;" only the people did not willingly accept it. The serum was excellent, clear, free from flocculi, etc. I used Nos. VII and VIII, and every bottle was good. ... I do not know anything of what has been done in India, but though I say so, the results with regard to the operation at any rate cannot be better. The serum was efficient in checking outbreaks. I think I can now get several thousand, in fact I have been promised them on condition I come out and do the inoculation or supervise the same. All my inoculations were carried out in the field under conditions such as the Assistants will have to do." 32. As regards the application of the researches carried out with a view to determine whether the samples of sera Nos. VII and VIII deposited, res- pectively, in Jacobabad, Madras and Rangoon, have in any way deteriorated in protective value, when exposed to the maximum shade temperatures recorded at each of the above-mentioned stations, I may here mention that serum deposited at depôts in the plains will materially lose in protective power, if allowed to be exposed to the ordinarily recorded maximum shade tempera- tures. 33. During the month of January last, 40,000 c. c. of anti-rinderpest serum was deposited equally at four depôts in the plains, viz., Lahore, Calcutta, Ajmere and Ahmednagar. The following table shows the maximum shade temperature recorded at each station during the past two years, 1900 and 1901. Years. Ahmednagar. Calcutta. Lahore. Ajmere. Madras.

It is, therefore, imperative that if depôts are to be maintained in the plains where sera may be stored, suitable receptacles (Refrigerators) must be provided for the purpose and be supplied daily with sufficient ice during the months when the thermometer records 90° and upwards. 34. Anthrax.9 accumulate, and when necessary be at our disposal to make use of. At present, it is somewhat difficult to record the various applications of the results of the researches undertaken, for none of these latter investigations are completely worked out, but are in various stages of development towards completion, and these results will be recorded in due course. SECTION III. Administration. 38. I remained in charge of the Laboratory during the year under review, and Veterinary Lieutenant J. D. E. Holmes, Civil Veterinary Department, took over the post of Assistant Bacteriologist from Veterinary Lieutenant G. K. Walker on 26th September 1901. 39. The major portion of the officers' time was occupied in preparing anti-Rinderpest and Anthrax sera and despatching the same to the Superintend- ents of the Civil Veterinary Department and other officers who applied for it. In addition, Test Experiments were continued throughout the year with a view to determine the protective power of the sera prepared. During the last three months of the official year, under the orders of Government, I carried out serum testing experiments in Cawnpore, Poona and Nagpur. 40. Locust Disease Fungus.10 44. Forest.-The arrangements for carrying out the prescriptions of the working plan of Muktesar Reserve have proved satisfactory, and the forest has been successfully protected against fire. During the past rains, several nurseries were made and seeds (Deodar, Chir, Kail and Gum) sown in order to provide plants for filling up open spaces and for replacing the trees utilized during the year. 45. Meteorological Observations.-The collection and record of these observations have been continued three times daily. A copy of these has been regularly supplied to the Meteorological Reporter to the Government of India on the last day of each month. As the chief work of the Laboratory progresses, the wisdom of initiating these meteorological observations become more and more apparent, for reference has continually been made to the records of former years when tabulating results of experiments during various tempera- tures and when arranging for new researches. 46.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGIST FOR THE YEAR 1902-1903. SECTION I. Research. Rinderpest.2 The subcutaneous injection of protective serum would appear to produce an immediate effect on the lining membrane of the gall-bladder and hence an increased production of the Nucleo-proteid. (6) The marked increase in N. P. in animals injected by the simul- taneous method occurs on the 7th and 8th day of disease and on the 11th day following inoculation. On comparison of this result with that obtained in Control Hill bulls, the sudden increase of N. P. appears one day later ; this may be explained by the facts that the effect of the injection of the protective serum appears to prolong the period of incubation. (7) The amount of N. P. in the bile of healthy young bovines is at its minimum previous to inoculation. The maximum amount in Serum Testing animals is attained on the 12th day of disease and 14th day following inoculation, after that date a gradual diminution in the amount of N. P. appears to take place, but the minimum according to our data, never falls to that found in health. It is but reasonable to account for the difference in the percentage of N. P. found at the height of the disease and when death takes place during recovery, on the supposition that the N. P. is re-absorbed into the system, in order to act as a recuperative or defensive agent, for it is difficult to suppose that nature provides this increase of a highly organised product simply to be voided from the system as a waste material. (8) The marked rise in N. P. in Hill buffaloes injected with rinderpest blood only, takes place on the 7th day of disease, not on the 6th day as in bovines, for the first symptoms of the disease in such animals appear on the 7th or 8th day following inoculation. (9) A comparison of the amount of N. P. in the bile of healthy and susceptible full grown plains and hill cattle and buffaloes with that in the bile of the same animals at death, after subcutaneous inoculation with the materies morbi of Rinderpest and Anthrax, indicates a considerable increase. Taking as a unit the amount of N. P. in health, the multiple at death for each class of animal were as follows :3 (12) When the dry N. P. obtained from rinderpest bile is made soluble in weak sodium carbonate solution and mixed in certain proportions with virulent rinderpest blood and allowed to stand for a certain period in vitro, it has the power of completely neutralizing the contagium of this disease. (13) Bovines (plains) and buffaloes (plains and hill), injected subcu- taneously with varying quantities of N. P. (made soluble in weak rinderpest bile) equivalent to the amount of N. P. found in the biles of hill cattle which succumbed to rinderpest on the 4th, 5th, and 6th days of disease, were found when tested 10 days later with virulent blood, to succumb or recover according to the amount of N. P. they respectively received. 4. Results of experiments with rinderpest bile and its N. P.4 the disease. Previous to its entry the amount of N. P. contained in the injected bile is generally sufficient to bring about a passive protection, but when the 6th day bile is utilized with the " materies morbi " of rinderpest present, the contagium is more or less kept in check by the action of the N. P. present, and produces in the injected animal a very modified form of the disease, but nevertheless the result is a transitory active immunity which may persist for a period of 3 to 5 months, according to the degree of virulence possessed by the contagium in the injected bile. Further, on the 5th day of the disease the average percentage of N. P. is only 0.5063 grammes per cent., the multiple of increase of N. P. being 28.93 per cent., whereas on the 6th day the average percentage of N. P. jumps up to 1.1160 grammes per cent. or a multiple of increase of 63.77 times more than the average found in healthy young hill cattle. A total increase of more than 100 per cent. in 24 hours. Consequently if the 6th day bile utilized for the purpose of injection should fail to bring about a transitory active immunity owing to absence of rinderpest contagium from the injected bile, the amount of N. P. present would in plains cattle be sufficient to produce a passive immunity which could be changed into an active immunity by the inoculation of virulent blood, several weeks later. 5. Normal Bile and its N. P.5 and 7 c. c. for plains per 600 lbs., has remained unaltered, which is a further proof that sera may be kept at the temperature of Muktesar without undergoing deterioration as a result. 9. Quetta.6 We may therefore assuredly assume that 7 c. c. administered by the serum alone method would be sufficient to carry such cattle through the period of an outbreak of rinderpest in the district. 13. Meerut bulls.7 Rats (Mus decumanus), some succumbed and some proved refractory both to the inoculated disease as well as to feeding experiments. The follow- ing animals and birds, viz., ponies (hill and plains breed), sheep, goats, dogs, cats, and fowls received large doses of bouillon cultures, 0.1 c.c. of which killed susceptible cattle, but all proved refractory. 20. Young hill cattle 1 to 3 years of age were found to be more susceptible than full-grown and older animals of the same breed, when primarily injected with certain biles collected from animals which had succumbed to Hæmorr- hagic Septicæmia, and later tested with 0.2 c.c. of virulent bouillon cultures. The former died whilst the latter recovered. 21. One attack of the disease confers immunity, but for what period in this country has not yet been ascertained. 22. The organisms of the disease which are said to remain virulent for a period of ten months in cultivation were found to have lost all power of re- producing the disease when kept at Muktesar, 7,500 feet elevation between November 17th, 1902, and April, 1903, lowest temperature recorded during the interval, 24.8°F. 23. The typical organism of Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia can readily be obtained from the body cavity of ticks (Ixodes) collected from affected animals during the latter portion of the course of the disease or at the time of death. The organism can be recovered in artificial cultures from the blood in the body cavities of such ticks and the cultures have been found to retain their virulence for rabbits. It is more than probable that female ticks replete with blood from Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia animals do drop off and when the cycle is complete, the young in their turn are the means by which the disease is conveyed to other animals, as is the case with the " Piroplasma bigeminum " in Texas or Tick Fever. 24. In a recent outbreak of spontaneous Septicæmia in rabbits, during which some 30 or more animals succumbed to the disease, they presented in their blood an organism identical in form, etc., to that found in Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia. Blood teeming with the typical bipolar staining organism and bouillon cultures of the same, failed to produce any effect when injected subcutaneously in plains cattle. 25. The practical results of this prolonged investigation will be found in Section II. 26. Hæmoglobinuria* or Red water in cattle and buffaloes.8 Of the two cattle observed with Hæmoglobinuria, one was brought from near the Ramganga river and the second from a district bordering on the Jamna river. Both animals were subcutaneously inoculated with virulent rinderpest blood one six weeks later than the other, but in both instances the symptoms of rinderpest were followed by those of Hæmoglobinuria before those of the former disease had disappeared from the affected animals, and on microscopical examination of their blood 60 and 62 per cent. respectively of the red blood corpuscles were found to contain the organism of the disease. 31. The control rinderpest blood utilized for inoculation purposes was found to be free from the materies morbi of the disease, and no other cattle, out of some 90 inoculated, showed symptoms of Hæmoglobinuria, so that the disease was not contracted at the Bareilly Depôt from the injected rinderpest blood. 32. Five plains bulls, several of which had only just passed through attacks of inoculated rinderpest, and one unprotected hill bull were each subcutaneously inoculated with (1 plains 1 c.c., 1 hill bull 1 c.c., and 4 plains 10 c.c.) blood drawn from the animals suffering from Hæmoglobinuria, the red corpuscles of which contained the " Piroplasma bigeminum." No thickening appeared at the seats of inoculation, a slight rise of temperature occurred in one plains animal, maximum 39.0°C., on the 5th evening. The "Piroplasma bigeminum" was not discovered in the blood of any of the inoculated animals and therefore Hæmoglobinuria never appeared as a symptom. The hill animal subsequently inoculated with 1 c.c. of virulent rinderpest blood succumbed to a severe attack of the malady on the 7th day of disease, and 10th following inoculation. No organisms (Piroplasma bigeminum) were dis- covered during the course of the disease. 33. It would therefore appear that the " Piroplasma bigeminum " is able to lie dormant in the systems of some of the plains cattle in this province, until such time as the restraining power present in the blood has been modified or removed, when it again assumes an active state; and the reduction or entire removal of the hereditary or acquired resistance to the organism may in some cases (perhaps when such protection is passing off) be materially hastened by such animal passing through an attack of (inoculated) rinderpest. 34. The blood of bovines which have shown symptoms of this disease and in which the " Piroplasma bigeminum " has been present in large numbers for several days, contains a most powerful toxin, a small quantity (1 c.c.) of which is capable of killing a small animal within a few minutes at most, subsequent to subcutaneous inoculation. 35. The plains and hill bulls inoculated with 1 c.c. and 10 c.c. doses respectively failed to react to the inoculated blood, although it contained a certain number of the " Piroplasma bigeminum " which microscopically were undergoing a marked change. It would appear that either an hereditary or acquired resistance must be possessed by plains and hill bovines alike although collected from districts so far apart, or that the presence of the powerful toxin when found in the blood must exercise an influence on the organism of the disease, so as to inhibit its action or destroy it altogether. 36. Ticks (Ixodes) more or less replete with blood were picked off the bodies of the affected animals. On microscopical examination of the contained blood, the red corpuscles were found to contain the (Piroplasma bigeminum) organisms of the disease. 37. Surra in camels.9 38. For the above observations three camels were obtained :10 46. Much further time and labour will have to be expended before a thorough grasp of the peculiarities of the disease as observed in this country can be arrived at, and therefore a longer period must elapse before any practical results can be hoped for. In the meantime, every advantage is being taken of recording by photographic methods the most important symptoms exhibited in the different animals affected, and drawings made of the different phases in the life history of the Trypanosoma of Dourine. 47. Human Tubercle.11 the middle of October, 1902, the period of the year when the Bhotias bring their animals from summer quarters to the plains. This occurrence hampered the serum output to a certain extent and it was for this reason that the advisability of having a segregation kraal was brought before Government and has since been sanctioned. It is, however, satisfactory to note that by working two small centrifugal machines for from 8 to 10 hours a day at their full velocity and also by the result of raising the protective values of weak sera, an increase of 40.4 per cent. in the output of serum has been made. 54. The following results have been collected from the reports received at this office concerning the serum injections and inoculations carried out in Bengal, Punjab, United Provinces, Assam, and Burma. The reports of other officers, who indented for serum as detailed in Appendix I, have not been received, although it was requested in this office letter No. 753, dated 6th October, 1902, through the Inspector-General, Civil Veterinary Department, that a summary of all field inoculations carried out with the serum prepared at Muktesar should be supplied to me from time to time, in order that a resumé of the results obtained might be included in the Annual Report. 55. Bengal.12 by the "serum alone method," in 17 villages 1,814 were injected without a death occurring from rinderpest. No information, however, is on record which would indicate whether these latter injections were performed in the absence of rinderpest and as a precautionary measure only. One may mention that the total deaths, viz.,13 59. Assam.14 At Quetta.15 for from typical cases and were secured and forwarded to me for examination. The specimens submitted were in each instance found to contain the organism of Barbone or Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia in virulent form and no other pathogenic organism16 been carried on and will be continued during the ensuing year with regard to other diseases with the material we have at our disposal, viz. :17 several different diseases have been entered upon which would have been next to impossible to conduct in the central Laboratory in the hills. Further, under the scheme for the training of Veterinary Assistants, arrange- ments had been made to give instructions to 20 assistants each month. During the year under report two courses were held at Bareilly, but only 27 Veterinary Assistants presented themselves for training, probably owing to the Delhi Durbar and the post-graduate course held at Lahore. 76.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGIST FOR THE YEAR 1903-1904. SECTION I. Administration. No. 201 C., dated Bareilly, the 4th April 1904. From2 as during the last year. The utilization of surplus material could not be effected ; and on account of the want of the contractors charcoal could not be manufactured and disposed of. During the year under review, a further trial was given to the plantation of deodars in blank places on the higher elevations. The natural regeneration of trees is making satisfactory progress in places free from the grazing rights of the villagers. 7. Meteorological Observations.3 controls of the above, each received 1 c. c. of the virulent hill blood. As the result the controls showed slight symptoms of the disease but quickly recovered. The two bulls inoculated with 5 c. c. each per 600 lbs. body weight, equal to 2.4 and 2.5 c.c. actual, exhibited thermal reactions with slight symptoms and quickly recovered. The remaining six animals presented no symptoms other than a rise of temperature. 14. The animals experimented with showed but a slight degree of suscep- tibility to rinderpest, the minimum dose of serum being too large, although all the abovementioned bulls exhibited, on microscopical examination of their blood, the pyroplasma which is so common a feature in the circulation of animals in these provinces. 15. As the previous experiment showed that virulent hill blood produced such mild symptoms in the animals inoculated, it was determined to expose the remaining number of bulls, 14 in number, to the action of plains and hill virulent rinderpest blood, half of the number with the former and half with the latter. The former portion of the experiment had to be postponed owing to the impossibility of obtaining plains rinderpest material at that time of the year. Consequently 14 head of cattle each received 1 c c. of virulent hill blood subcutaneously, 12 being inoculated with material obtained from hill bull No. 116 C. and two with material from hill bull No. 112 C. All the animals exhibited more or less thermal reactions varying between maxima of 39°.2 and 41°0c., but five showed no other symptoms. One, however, suc- cumbed to a fairly severe attack of rinderpest complicated with pyroplasmosis. The blood of each animal, examined microscopically, presented organisms which are classed under the head of pyroplasmata. 16. Until the question has been definitely settled as to whether the mortality in the plains animals is greater when rinderpest has been contracted subcutaneously or inoculated from plains to plains, one must necessarily express but a guarded opinion, but it would appear likely that the great mortality of 45 to 53 per cent. in Hamirpur and Jalaun Districts must be due to other forms of disease than rinderpest, perhaps running concurrently in the same animal. 17. Bulls from the Bijnor District.4 19. Testing anti-rinderpest serum on hill bulls by the "serum alone" method.-As the question with regard to the period during which hill cattle may receive protection against rinderpest for, when subcutaneously injected with varying doses of anti-rinderpest serum, had not been definitely settled, this opportunity was utilized to determine it, after quantities of 30, 60 and 90 c. c. followed later by inoculations with virulent hill blood in those animals which survived. Six hill bulls were selected and two each received the above-mentioned quantities irrespective of body weight on 27th January 1904. All the animals exhibited the pyroplasma in their circulations in a latent form. (i) The injection of varying doses of serum only, 30 to 90 c. c. into hill animals which exhibited a species of pyroplasma in their blood, may bring about depressing conditions which act as stimulants to the organisms in ques- tion, and the animals may succumb to their action. (ii) A dose of 30 c. c. of anti-rinderpest serum in the same class of animals and in the presence of a pyroplasma is insufficient to confer a passive immunity even for a period of 13 days. But a dose of 60 c. c. would appear to be sufficient to bring about a partial protection after an interval of 26 days. 20. Quinine as a curative or preventive in Bovine Rinderpest.5 pyroplasma, but modifications in the specific characters of the hæmotozoon probably are developed during its passage through the different species. Up to the present the organism has been discovered in the blood of equines, bovines, buffaloes, camels, elephants, monkeys, ovines, canines and many other small animals, not only in one district but in animals brought from the Punjab and United Provinces alike. Further, it has been observed in the blood of the five months' fætus, showing that it can pass through the walls of the placental vessels. The symptoms produced in man owing to its presence are:6 serum alone method. Of this number 174 animals succumbed after injections being a mortality of 1.84 per cent. It is significant of the value of the serum when used in affected herds of the Darjeeling and Chittagong (Hill Tracts) to find that only 3.25 per cent. of injected animals succumbed, for in an ordinary outbreak of rinderpest among such cattle a percentage of from 90 to 98 usually follows. 27.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGIST FOR THE YEAR 1904-1905. SECTION I. Administration. No. 502, dated Muktesar, the 23rd June 1905. From2 (iv) Observations on the Filarial Embryos found in the general circula- tion of the Equidae and Bovidae and their probable pathological significance. "Fasiculus I. Bursati," published by Adlard and Son, London. (v) The significance of the pyriform and globular bodies present in the circulation, organs and tissues in various forms of disease in man and animals, respectively, with suggestions regarding their identi- fication and classification. 4. Mallein.3 A nursery of Deodar plants has now been started at Ritani from seeds obtained from the Jaunsar Forests in the Chakrata district. 11. Meteorological Observations.4 much enhanced doses of the same serum to combat a more severe form of the malady. The animals used at Muktesar for the production of virulent blood are the small breed of cattle, rarely exceeding 200 lbs. in body weight, indigenous to the Himalayan or hill regions. These are more susceptible to rinderpest than any of the animals of the plains of India, as far as is known, for here- ditary or acquired immunity is seldom observed. The incubation period of inoculated rinderpest in hill bovines is generally 3½ days, but it has been found that after passing the virulent strain through a succession of Hill animals, an uncertain percentage of these exhibit the primary rise in tempera- ture after a period of 2½ days, and there appeared to be marked indications that the inoculated disease, after being passed through a long series of animals, possessed the same or more virulent qualities than the strain of virulent blood at the time of its first collection. In this regard, it is of importance to note that Pasteur passed the virus of rabies through a succession of rabbits for a period of 2 to 3 years, until the course of the disease, which at first occupied 18 days, was reduced to a fixed period of ten days only. The material obtained from such animals he termed his " virus fixe." On the 14th and 22nd April 1901, two strains of blood were obtained, one from plains cattle in the Hamirpur District, United Provinces, and a second from Talli Byarhi, near Ranikhet, from the small Himalayan breed in the hills. Both varieties of blood appeared to be equally virulent and produced the usual train of symptoms of rinderpest when inoculated into hill cattle, but it was advisable to carry on our researches with but one strain of the disease, so the hill blood was selected for the purposes of further inocula- tion. From the time of collection, 22nd April 1901, to the end of 1904, this strain of blood was used in all instances and there appeared to be no reason why it should not be as virulent or more so than the blood obtained from fresh epizootics of rinderpest.* During the winter months a reduction in the number of inoculations was made, and as the blood on one occasion failed to reproduce a virulent form of disease this necessitated our obtaining fresh material from a virulent source. An outbreak was reported, on the 20th December 1904, from Talli Mirai near Ranikhet and the necessary blood collected, which on inoculation into hill animals reproduced a severe type of rinderpest. No. XXIV serum had been tested with the strain of rinderpest blood just previous to its failure, and the dose proved to be 3 c. c. for plains and 54 c. c. for hill cattle, per 600 lbs, respectively. In order to test the value of the new strain of virulent blood and compare the result with that of the old sera previously tested, experiments were initiated and these proved that 3.66 times the dose of serum was necessary as compared with that previously found experimentally. Consequently, comparative experiments were conducted with several brews of rinderpest sera with the following results:5 It must be understood that virulent rinderpest material, both plain and hill, cannot always be obtained when most needed for laboratory purposes. In future, however, efforts will be made to maintain the intensity of the virus, by securing fresh virulent material at short intervals, whenever possible. Tests made with this material (in virulent form) should insure the immediate detection of any deterioration which may possibly have occurred, and thus the potency of the serum prepared would be assured. 19. The above discovery is one of great importance to us in the preparation of rinderpest sera and, of necessity, materially reduced the total output during the past 12 months. But this reduction is compensated for by the knowledge that the dose of serum, as now issued, is probably capable of combating the most virulent form of the disease as met with in India (hills). It may be argued that most probably the doses of serum as issued were sufficient to protect the great majority of animals against rinderpest in the plains, but it is an extraordinary occurrence that full doses of the sera in question failed to protect plains animals by the simultaneous method when the new strain of rinderpest blood was used for the purpose, in experiments at the Laboratory. Further, that plains animals with much enhanced doses to those primarily injected succumbed to the disease, until a dose was arrived at, equivalent to 1/18 the dose of serum required to protect hill cattle, when the new strain of virulent rinderpest blood was utilized. 20. It is a source, however, of great satisfaction to record that no com- plaints of insufficient doses of serum have been received, in any instance, from Superintendents, during the issue of No. XXIV serum. From the researches made at the Laboratory, I find that hill cattle which succumb to fairly large doses of anti-rinderpest serum when tested by the simultaneous method (i.e., blood and serum at the same time on opposite sides of the body) do not succumb when animals are first injected with a small quantity of serum and at a later period (48 hours), receive virulent blood or are driven amongst an infected herd as in the plains, in order to contract the disease and undergo the simultaneous method in a modified form. These results may explain in the case of plains animals, (which generally exhibit much less susceptibility to rinderpest than the hill cattle,) why the small dose of serum when injected into the former was sufficient to guard against infection. On the other hand, from a practical point of view, it is probable that of a large number of plains cattle injected with anti-rinderpest serum, only a small number of them would come in contact with infected members of such herd in the field and, therefore, the majority would run but a minimum chance of infection. 21. Experiments were initiated and continued with a view to the produc- tion of a prophylactic capable of conferring immunity on bovines, etc., in order to avoid the necessity of hyper-immunizing cattle with large quantities of virulent blood, but nothing can of course be stated at this stage with regard to the results, etc., until something conclusive is arrived at. 22. As desired by Government, the serum in dry form was prepared for experimental purposes by Captain Holmes and its utility tried in the field. The results submitted by the respective Superintendents who utilized the serum will be found in the following section. One great advantage in its favour is that the serum in powder can be distributed in much smaller bulk. A great disadvantage, however, is that no carbolic or other antiseptic can be added to this in dry form, and the powder must be used within 24 hours after solution has been made. Thus, it will throw much work and responsibility on the Superintendents, as it would be impossible to trust the majority of Veterinary Assistants for this particular work in the field. The use of this powder is distinctly indicated in cases where the services of officers or trained and trustworthy subordinates can be ensured for the preparation of the solution for subcutaneous injection, and further, I should imagine that its greatest use will be found to be in the case of expeditions6 except the record of Nunn that the disease, most probably spontaneous, occurs among camels in the Punjab and is called Zahmat or Zahmat osat in Mont- gomery District and Mori in Hazara. During the past winter at Bareilly, I was able to solve the question in the affirmative whether camels in these provinces (United Provinces) are susceptible to inoculated bovine rinderpest and vice versâ. A separate brochure will shortly be submitted to Government for publication, but the following short resumé of facts connected with the observed manifestations are herewith recorded. The period of incubation of camel rinderpest when the animals are inoculated with virulent hill bovine blood, varies from 5 to 7 days, that is, in animals which were inoculated about mid-day and whose temperatures were taken twice daily at 9 A. M. and 4 P. M., the primary rise was found to take place at the 9th or between the 9th and 13th temperatures. These animals (3 in number) which received 20 c. c. of blood, respectively, showed the first symptom of disease, viz., a sudden rise in temperature from the normal to 39.7 or 40.6°C.7 complicating rinderpest in animals, hill or plains, utilized in the preparation of anti-rinderpest serum. One reason of the variation, or rather decrease in virulence, of rinderpest blood used in the preparation of sera, may be attributed to the presence of piroplasmata and trypanosomata, or both, in the circulation of the hill cattle. These organisms were not observed in stained specimens during 19008 Septicæmia serum, 3,133 doses of which are now available for immediate issue, and a much larger supply will be forthcoming in a few weeks' time for use during the coming rainy season. At present, a series of experiments are being prosecuted with a view to ascertain the period during which immunity persists, when animals are injected with serum only, as is carried out in the case of bovines and buffaloes exposed to the virus of rinderpest in various epizootics. 31. A separate brochure will be submitted detailing the points of interest observed in the course of Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia in this country, as soon as time will permit. 32. Surra in camels.-Of the three camels, the subjects of surra placed under daily observation from 23rd November 1902, up to date, two succumbed to surra during the rains of 1903, while the third, attacked during the rains of 1902, survived but exhibited trypanosomata in its blood at intervals up to the 5th April 1904, and probably through the rains. Between this latter date and November 14th, 1904, the blood was not examined. But from the 15th November, a systematic examination was conducted daily and it elucidated the fact that the trypanosoma was absent on the first examination and ever since ; further, that equines inoculated with 20 c. c. of blood drawn from the. general circulation, failed to contract the disease. This experiment proves that the general opinion held by the camel sowars, viz., that camels if capable of passing through a period of Surra lasting three years and termed by them Tibursa, will eventually recover, was quite correct. 33. An extensive series of experiments with regard to the etiology, etc., of the camel trypanosoma have been undertaken and the results when ready for publication, will be submitted to the Government in a separate report. 34. To attempt a prophylactic or curative serum.9 of a camel which had only presented the trypanosoma in its blood during a period of a few three or four months. After the usual period of incubation, the trypanosoma appeared in the blood, and during a period of 685 days, large numbers of paroxysms and intermissions were passed through until towards the end of the period the trypanosoma could no more be found in the peripheral circulation of the animal, and its blood when injected in large quantities into a second healthy equine failed to reproduce the disease. On the 18th December 1904, the horse which primarily received camel surra and eradicated the trypanosoma from its system, was inoculated a second time, but on this occasion with the T. Evansi. Again the animal passed through repeated paroxysms and intermissions after an incubation period lasting 7 days. Unfortunately, on the 102nd day of disease, having lived nearly three times the average of a horse inoculated with equine surra, the animal met with an accident and succumbed. Otherwise, there was no evi- dence that the animal might not have continued to live. 38. On the 24th November 1904, two experiments with a similar end in view were initiated, two horses receiving 20 c. c. of blood subcutaneously from a fresh case of camel surra. These animals at a later date will be tested with equine surra, in order to prove if any protection has been afforded by the trypanosoma of camel Surra. * (Tetra zoieete benzidin-monosulfosäure and Naphtbglanüdi sulfosäure Natron.) 39.

Two series of 16 illustrations of Dourine (bromide enlargements for teaching purposes) have been supplied to the Madras and Poona Veterinary Schools, respectively, during the past year. 43. During the year under report 124 specimens were received for microscopical examination and report. The great majority of these were specimens of pus obtained from animals suffering from Lymphangitis Epizootica. SECTION III. Application of the result of research. 44. During the year 1904-05, 813,352 c. c. of anti-rinderpest serum have been prepared, and 564,428 c. c.or 130,810 doses were issued as per detail in Appendix I. Further, 10,300 c. c. of old and returned serum were handed over to Dr. Maynard for the purposes of experiments connected with the preparation of serum in powder form. The serum prepared is equivalent to 151,855 doses, as against 122,061 doses during the past official year. The demand for rinderpest serum was greater by 16,012 than that of the last year, and by 43,019 doses than that of the year before last. 45. In addition to the above liquid from, 3,533 doses of serum in powder were prepared. For the test purposes in the field, consignments of the same were forwarded to the Superintendents, Civil Veterinary Department, Bengal and Burma, also to Lieutenant Jelbart, Army Veterinary Department, Silliguri, Sikkim Field Force. The returns received from Bengal did not reveal any con- clusive results. Lieutenant Jelbart had no opportunity of testing the immuniz- ing properties of this serum, as there had not been any rinderpest existing amongst the transport animals. The experiments conducted by the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Burma, show that of 138 animals injected with the serum in powder, 45 or 32.60 per cent. were attacked after injection and 7 or 5.11 per cent. died. For the sake of comparison, the same officer injected 42 animals with liquid serum (No. XVII). Of these animals, 19 were attacked after injection and 2 or 4.76 per cent died ; but in this instance it was subsequently proved that serum XVII (prepared -at this Laboratory in April 1903) had lost considerably in power during the interval between its issue and use, viz., from a dose of 6 c. c. per 600 lbs. body weight (Plains) to 10 c. c. 46. The following results have been collated from the returns received in this office during the year under report concerning the serum injections carried out by the serum alone method, in the various provinces. 47.

G. I. C. P. O. No. 956.No. 1522 The " serum alone" method, therefore, as adopted by the Department appears to be perfectly suited to our requirements, being easy of application, causing little or no trouble to owners, tiding over outbreaks and preventing spread of the disease, and reducing the mortality in a degree quite extra- ordinary. 10. In addition to the ordinary liquid serum, 3,538 doses of serum in powder were prepared and issued to Bengal and Burma for trial in the field. The experiments were not very conclusive as to its efficacy compared with the ordinary serum, but, in any case, unfortunately, it is not so well suited to our purposes as the latter, on account of the fact that no Carbolic or other antiseptic can be added to it and the powder must be used 24 hours after it has been made up into solution. It is considered inadvisable to trust Veterinary Assistants in this particular work in the field, as it requires considerable care. Notwith- standing, therefore, the bulk and trouble in carriage, it is only in exceptional cases, such as those in which qualified Veterinary Officers are employed, that this dry serum can replace the ordinary liquid form as at present prepared in the Laboratory. 11. Anthrax.3 Experiments are now being conducted with a view to ascertaining the length of time for which the conferred immunity lasts. 17. Dr. Lingard has continued his experiments with Surra and has endeavoured to produce immunity by means of a prophylactic or curative serum, by attenuating the trypanosoma by means of cultures and by passing it through the bodies of animals other than equines. In addition to this, treat- ment with Trypan-rot and arsenate of Soda have been tried. Unfortunately, none of these methods are of much practical value and we are still after years of patient work, not only in our own Laboratery but in many others in America and on the Continent, as far off as ever from an efficient prophylactic or curative agent for this deadly and widespread disease. 18. Charbon Symptomatique has, by its prevalence in certain parts of the country, claimed a share of attention. It has, unfortunately, been so far found impossible to cultivate the bacterium at Muktesar. Successful inocula- tions had been carried on in the Punjab by Captain Walker and Mr. Oliver last year with a protective vaccine prepared by Arloing, Cornevin and Thomas, but this was discontinued pending the preparation of a vaccine at the Laboratory. Owing to failure of obtaining culture we are again importing this, and it will be available during the coming year. I consider this very desirable as the inoculations so far made have been successful and the people are asking that their young stock may be protected by this method. 19.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGIST FOR THE YEAR 1905-1906. SECTION I. Administration. No. 674, dated Muktesar, the 25th June 1906. From2 (ii) A new species of Trypanosoma found in the blood of rats together with a new metrical method of standardizing the measurements of Trypanosomata3 As in previous years, I received hearty co-operation from the staff and establishment in the discharge of the multifarious duties connected with the working of this Laboratory, which is ever on the increase. SECTION II. Research. 13. The work to be carried out during 1905-1906 was proposed on the following diseases being similar to the rough programme suggested for the last year:4 15. Serum experiments.5 causal agent of rinderpest loses its high degree of virulence for hill bulls, the most susceptible breed of cattle in India, by passage through the black buck. 18. Piroplasmosis, Trypanosomiasis, Foot and Mouth, Stomatitis and Spirillosis in the blood of bovines.6 less extent to sheep, goats and many small animals. Country-bred horses are immune but donkeys succumbed to inoculations of virulent blood. In some districts in this country, the disease is said to appear sporadically during the whole year, especially those localities which are marshy or intersected by rivers. The disease, however, becomes epizootic, as a rule, during the monsoon and during or after the Christmas rains. Several types of this disease may be encountered in the field, viz., (i) Superficial or Cutaneous ; (ii) Thoracic; (iii) Intestinal; and these in acute or chronic form. During the course of these researches, it has been found that hill animals are the most susceptible to Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia. Buffaloes and plains bovines coming next, in the order mentioned. It must, however, be distinctly recognized that the " materies morbi " differs in virulence considerably in different outbreaks, and further the susceptibility of the animals of various breeds exposed to the " contagium" likewise varies. Consequently, the periods which intervene, viz., the incubation period of the malady and that between the exhibition of the first symptom recognisable and death, may also be found to vary considerably. Experimentally it has been demonstrated that one large drop of a virulent broth culture of the organism of Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia inoculated subcutaneously, was sufficient to bring about death respectively in buffaloes, hill and plains bovines, in the following periods :7 (vii) Plains and hill buffaloes injected subcutaneously with 3 c. c. of serum and 48 hours later tested with virulent culture, were found at a later date to possess an active immunity. (viii) A dose of 35 c. c. of serum injected intravenously in hill cattle has been found necessary to overcome the effects of a lethal dose of virulent culture injected subcutaneously 15 hours previously ; the animals thus treated presented no symptoms of the disease. Consequently, this mode of treatment, on account of the large quantity of serum necessary, cannot be recommended except in the case of valuable cattle being attacked, and even then if any symptoms are exhibited, probably a much larger dose would be required than the one above mentioned. 29. When bovines were hyper-immunized with the toxins produced by the causal factor of Hæmorrhagic Septiæmia.8 the control. Others showed no thermal reactions, a sign that the dose of serum injected was too large and therefore the " causal agent " was destroyed, without conferring any active immunity. In order to prove this supposition, the surviving animals were again, after a period of eight days, subjected to a larger dose of Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia virulent culture, to test their degree of protection. It was found that the animals which had respectively exhibited thermal reactions, viz., those which received doses of buffalo testes serum, yolk of egg products and casinogen survived the ordeal, and. the others suc- cumbed in various periods, demonstrating the fact that the passive immunity conferred was but of short duration. In a second series of experiments with enhanced doses of Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia culture in the first instance, it was discovered that the serum prepared from the casinogen (milk) was the only one which stool the severe test, and in this case the animal exhibited no symptoms other than a slight thermal reaction, emphasizing the great power of this form of serum which 2 years and 9 months in bottles at the time of retesting still maintained its efficacy. Equine Surra. 31. To attenuate by passing through the body of animals.9 the one which received 0.2 c. c. exhibited an incubation period of three and a half days and succumbed on the third day of the malady with over one hundred try- panosomata in each field of the microscope (Leitz. Oc. 4 Obj. VII), maximum temperature 39.9°C., only 0.9°C. above the normal of health. The second animal pricked once only with the finest needle of a Pravatz syringe (detached from the body of the instrument) containing a trace of a drop of Surra blood (hæmatozoa 17 in a field of the microscope) succumbed to an acute Septi- cæmia, the blood at the time of death containing an enormous number of Bipolar staining Cocco-bacilli. The third animal was also once pricked with a small needle detached from the Pravatz syringe in the skin of the back. In this instance, the contained Surra blood presented seven trypanosomata in a field of the microscope. The incubation period occupied four and a half days. Two paroxysms occurred lasting 12 and 15 days respectively and two inter- missions of 3 and 10 days, death taking place on the first day of the third paroxysm with one flagellate in 25 fields of the microscope. Course of disease 41 days. From the above experiments one may draw certain deductions10 a period of four years, with special reference to the life history of the causal agent, has been almost finished and will be published at the first opportunity. 37. A new form of organism has been discovered by me in the erythro- cytes of some camels suffering from spontaneous trypanomiasis. Specimens have been forwarded to Professor Schaudinn for favour of identification. The organism presents the appearance of a long thread, one extremity termi- nating in a small protuberance. Individually the length varies from 25µ to 26.2511 Tuberculosis in Camels. 41. In my letter No. 108 C., dated the 16th January 1906, I reported to the Inspector General, Civil Veterinary Department, the fact that a camel received at Bareilly on November 22nd, 1905, in very poor condition, supposed to be the subject of Camel Trypanosomiasis and previously under observation for a period of 51 days, had suddenly succumbed. At the autopsy, conducted immediately after death, extensive pathological changes were observed in the lungs and the post-tracheal glands, due to the presence of what appeared to be tuberculosis. This subject is still under investigation, as it is one of considerable interest, the casual agent, in the first instance, differ- ing considerably from the bacilli found in human, bovine and avian tuber- culosis. Guinea pigs inoculated with material from the lung of the affected animal succumbed to general tuberculosis after periods of 114 and 96 days, respectively. This series is being continued to obtain further results. Glanders. 42. During the latter part of 1905 and the early portion of the present year, a certain number of cases in equines were observed the symptoms of which simulated true glanders, but which failed to react to approved Mallein. Guinea pigs inoculated by the Strauss method, either failed to give any marked re- action, or when such was present, the results passed off without producing serious symptoms, until a much later date. Death, however, eventually occurred in about 43 days, instead of in from 8 to 15, as in the case of virulent glanders. The organism, obtained from material received from the Bombay Vete rinary Col- lege, when cultures were made at Bareilly and later at Muktesar. resembled somewhat the B. Mallei, but was shorter and not so wide. After passage through a number of equines the Bombay Bacillus became much more viru- lent, and the cultures which at first failed to produce a brown colour on potato, finally did so, the colour produced being of the same hue or even slightly darker than the growth of the B. Mallei. Further, Mallein in 1.0 c. c. doses prepared from the Bombay organism, and injected into a pony, the subject of true glanders, produced a thermal and a local reaction at the seat of injection. From the above observations, it would appear that in this country the virulence of the B. Mallei may become reduced, owing to some cause or causes not yet determined, and that under some conditions, an animal suffer- ing from a mitigated form of disease may fail to exhibit a reaction when injected with approved Mallein. This investigation is being continued and will be the subject of a full report when the important results observed have been thoroughly studied. Tuberculine. 43. On the 11th September 1902, tuberculine was prepared in ordinary glycerine, beef bouillon from a cultivation of B. Tuberculosis Bovis received from Berlin. The flask containing the bouillon culture was kept in an incuba- tor at 37°C. for a period of over six weeks. The contents of the flask were sterilized three times at 100°C. for 20 minutes on each occasion, then filtered through paper and evaporated over a boiling " bain-marie " to one-tenth of its original bulk. The residue was then placed in a tightly fitting brown glass stoppered bottle without added carbolic acid and was kept in the dark, at room temperature for a period of four years. On the 4th August 1905, the contents of the bottle were examined, then it was observed that numerous round white balls were present measuring up to two millimetres in diameter. On microscopical examination, these balls were found to consist of bacilli massed together, and when stained with Zhiel and later decolourised with 30 per cent. nitric acid and counter-stained with Methyl. Blue, the whole of the bacilli were found to have retained the red colour, and corresponded exactly with the B. Tuberculosis. Guinea pigs, inoculated on the 4th August 1905, were found to be perfectly healthy when destroyed on the 21st January 1906, and a third guinea pig, inoculated intraperitoneally with 1.0 c. c. of fluid, containing a consider- able number of disintegrated balls at bacilli in bouillon, at a subsequent date
12 showed no rise in temperature or other symptoms of tuberculosis. This obser- vation tends to emphasize the importance of passing tuberculine through a porcelain filter during the process of preparation, for, although the bacilli proved to be inert after a period of four years, they must have retained their vitality in the first instance in order to increase in number, but even then it is questionable whether they could have retained their virulence. 44. Specimens examined.13 doses and the total issue 1,296,764 c. c. or 204,979 doses as per detail shown in Appendix I. The following statement will show at a glance the marked increment both in output and issue of the anti-rinderpest serum during the last four years:14 Out of 50,050 head of cattle and 709 ovines injected by the serum alone method in 170 outbreaks, occurring in 21 districts of the Punjab, only 18 animals or 0.035 per cent. died of rinderpest after inoculation, whilst in the same outbreaks 2,340 animals had succumbed before the serum injections were undertaken. In the Kangra District 822 head of hill cattle were injected in three outbreaks and no death occurred after the serum was injected. These extraordinary results, especially the latter, emphasize the great efficacy of the serum utilized. 51. North-West Frontier Province.15 53. Bengal.16 Although not stated in the Bengal returns, we must note that a number of the districts mentioned above are evidently in the hills, consequently, the returns show excellent results when it is remembered that this breed of cattle (hill) are so highly susceptible to the disease. 54. Central Provinces and Berar.17 55. Madras.18 57. Assam19 carcasses in enormous numbers in its wake. Now, instead of thousands of animals succumbing as the result, in some instances, of only one unchecked outbreak, it is becoming difficult in those provinces which are in the van of serum therapy to observe any large outbreaks at all. This result is easily understood when we consider that, in the above-mentioned provinces, immedi- ately an outbreak is discovered by those in charge, the whole of the affected and contact animals are injected with serum or a cordon of protected cattle is formed round the primary focus of the disease and its further progress stopped. 61. Anthrax.20 Further, as an additional 60 men had been in contact with the contami, nated wool, it was thought advisable to administer to each of them 5 c. c. of serum subcutaneously as a prophylactic. No untoward symptom occurred in 59 of the above cases. However, 14 days after the respective injections of serum had been made, one man contracted the disease but recovered. During the said period of 14 days all the men were in great peril of contracting the malady as they were employed cleansing the wool sheds where the infected material was stored. There were seven deaths in all giving a death-rate of 58.33 per cent., the case of malignant pustule not being included in the calculation. The three cases in which serum was not utilized all succumbed, and out of nine, which were treated with serum, four deaths occurred giving a mortality of 44.4 per cent. If we eliminate the two cases in which the tetanic spasms were present, pre- vious to the injection of serum, and also the two cases which were progressing favourably after the discontinuance of the serum treatment but succumbed on assuming the semi-upright position, then the mortality in the cases treated by anti-Anthrax serum was nil. Previous experience dictated that there would be but little chance of success with the serum in cases which exhibited advanced nervous complications, but it was deemed advisable to give the patients the benefit of the serum treatment. All the cases treated benefited by the serum injections, and the only regret of the Medical Superintendent was that the serum treatment had not been utilized earlier, and in the two advanced cases of the disease, which exhibited marked nervous symptoms, intravenous injection had not been had recourse to instead of subcutaneous. 65. It is for those in authority to consider the advisability of depositing a certain quantity of Anthrax serum of high potency, in sealed tubes for imme- diate use in all Jails in which foreign or home wool or goat hair is utilized in the manufacture of Jail products. The preparation of such a serum would be an easy matter in this Laboratory, but it would take a period of five months to prepare one possessing a high protective value. 66. Assam.21 67.

The history of the outbreaks of this disease, however, is 'sudden appearance and equally sudden disappearance.' A certain number of victims are claimed and the outbreak is over. " 72.

At present " Blacklegoids" are in use in certain Provinces and have so far given satisfaction as they are efficient and easy to use. 15. In the direction of research also the experiments with regard to the protective value of various anti-rinderpest sera prepared in different ways are of great interest. They show that it will possibly be found practicable to considerably increase the potency of the serum and hence reduce the dose required, which would result in considerable saving. 16. It has been proved that the Black buck is susceptible to rinderpest and capable of spreading it. 17. Work was continued with Piroplasmosis, Horse and Camel Trypano- somiasis, Anthrax, Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia, Charbon Symptomatique and Dourine. 18. Dr. Lingard reports the occurrence of Tuberculosis in the camel and Spirillum in cattle, and also of a new form of organism present in the erythro- cytes of camels suffering from spontaneous trypanosomiasis. 19. The remarks regarding the reduction of the virulence of Bacillus Mallei are very interesting; a similar organism to that discribed by Mr. Lingard was also found in cases in the Lahore College Laboratory by Captain Baldrey. 20. In addition to the papers published by the Imperial Bacteriologist, Mr. Montgomery, Assistant Bacteriologist, has published " Observations on Bilharziosis in animals " and Captain Baldrey " some observations in normal and rinderpest blood." The work for these papers was carried out in the Muktesar Laboratory. 21. The report is interesting and valuable, the work done has been very great, the results excellent, and very great credit is due to Dr. Lingard and his Assistants. ___________ No. 1960ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGIST FOR THE YEAR 1906-1907.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGIST FOR THE YEAR 1906-1907. SECTION I. Administration. No. 609, dated Muktesar, the 6th July 1907. From2 6. During the past year, in addition to my other work, I published the following papers :3 the results as when conducted at Bareilly. Further, researches with regard to diseases in large animals, as for instance, elephants, camels can only be carried on, under plains conditions, in a Laboratory like that at Bareilly. In addition, when a succession of tests upon plains animals have to be conducted, such animals of different ages as are required are easily obtainable at short notice and at a less cost at Bareilly than at Muktesar. 13. Staff and establishment.4 I recorded the presence of Sp. bandicotti in the blood of a percentage of Mus (Nesokia) giganteus in Poona. Rabbits and guinea-pigs inoculated subcutaneously with blood containing these spirochetes, concurrently with the Trypanosomata which the above-mentioned rodents harbour, contracted the disease, and death resulted in the majority of instances. A paper entitled "Some forms of Spiroch5 with 0.001 c.c. of horse's blood, containing swarms of flagellates, varies from 5 to 5.5 days. The course of the disease from the first appearance of the flagellate in the blood until death occupied five days. (b) After the thirty-sixth passage through white mice.6 in about 39 hours. Animals of the above body-weight subcutaneously injected with 5 c.c. of a 1 per cent. solution always recover, without the exhibition of serious symptoms. Guinea-pigs of 200 grammes body-weight always succumb to doses of 2.5 c.c. of a 1 per cent. solution of atoxyl in about 51 hours. Lethal dose of atoxyl for healthy equines. IN THE PLAINS. 24. (a) Mules.7 The effect of different doses of atoxyl in equines, the subject of spontaneous equine trypanosomiasis. 26, A single dose of atoxyl (1 to 2 grammes) when injected subcutaneously is capable of temporarily destroying (for 4 to 5 days) the mature trypano- somata, when present in considerable numbers in the circulation of an equine. In order to totally destroy the immature forms of the flagellate, it is necessary to administer repeated doses of the drug 3 to 5 grammes on each occasion, at intervals of eight to ten days, according to the body-weight of the affected animal. It must, however, be borne in mind, that equines the subjects of trypano- somiasis, especially when large numbers of flagellates are present in their blood, are much less tolerant of atoxyl than healthy animals, as was found to be the case with Arsenic in the form of Liq. arsenicalis. 27. Are Indian elephants susceptible to inoculated equine trypanoso- miasis ?8 numerous trypanosomata. Period of incubation 8.5 days. Twenty paroxysms lasting 79 days and twenty intermissions lasting 444 days followed, making a total of 523 days. On the 4th August 1906, the animal not having exhibited any trypanosomata in its blood, for several months, was tested with sponta- neous equine trypanosomiasis, receiving 1.0 c.c. of blood subcutaneously (flagellates numerous). Period of incubation 6.5 days. Six paroxysms and six intermissions occurred, lasting 28 and 38 days, respectively. The animal, succumbed on 15th October 1906, 605 days after the primary and 73 days after the secondary inoculation. From the results obtained from the above experiments, it will be observed that animals (camel and donkeys) which have acquired immunity for the casual factor of camel trypanosomiasis are still susceptible and succumb to the T. evansi. 29. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia.9 SECTION III. Applications of the result of research. 33. During the year under review, Foot and Mouth disease appeared as usual at the beginning of the cold season among the fresh hill bulls received through our agent in the Himalayas, but with careful precautions was con- fined to the outskirts of the Laboratory Estate. 34. Rinderpest serum.10 In the Province of Bombay, out of 31,415 animals injected with serum 651 or 2.07 per cent. have been reported to have succumbed to the disease, clearly pointing to the fact that either some of the animals received serum when the disease was in its incubating stage or the cattle were more susceptible. The returns forwarded by the Senior Veterinary Officer, Poona, from Neemuch and Mhow, show, that of 238 bovines, buffaloes and 1 camel injected, 5 deaths have occurred. The returns submitted by the Principal, Bombay Veterinary College, point to the fact that 660 head of cattle were injected, but owing to the unavoidable circumstances no records of results obtained after inoculation could be col- lected. The value of the Anti-rinderpest serum in cutting short outbreaks which would otherwise have been of a serious nature, has now been well established. The Veterinary Officer of Cachar and Sylhet, Mr. McCaldron, M.R.C.V.S., etc., informs me that the result of serum injections carried on by him, during the close of the last financial year, were most satisfac- tory. 37.
