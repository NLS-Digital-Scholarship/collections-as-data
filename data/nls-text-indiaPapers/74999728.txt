Explanation of the Plate. A.On the characters and relationships of Afzelia Smith. BY D. PRAIN, M.B., MAJOR, I.M.S., Superintendent, Royal Botanic Garden, Sibpur, Calcutta; Director of the Botanical Survey of India. A Leguminous genus Afzelia was founded by Smith in 1798 for a tropical African tree. The name was designed to perpetuate the memory of Adam Afzel, Professor at Upsala. When he proposed this name, Smith knew that another Afzelia had been established by Gmelin in 1791 with the same object. Because Smith was uncertain as to the affinities of Gmelin's genus he held it unworthy to be associated with Afzel's name. Time brings its revenges; there is less dubiety now regarding Gmelin's Afzelia than there is about Smith's. Gmelin's Afzelia is the Scrophularineous genus which Pursh in 1814 recharacterised as Seymeria; under this name its species are more familiarly known. No one, since Smith wrote, has been able to find a plant exhibiting all the characters that he attribut- ed to his Afzelia. Smith's Afzelia was placed by its author (Trans. Linn. Soc. iv. 221 ) in Linné's Decandria Monogynia, Jussieu's Leguminosae, near to Hymenaea. His brief essential characters are:2 Scientific Memoirs by filmenta duo suprema sterilia into "dix étamines libres, huit fertiles, les deux supérieures stériles." This important change, though afterwards adopted by DeCandolle, in connexion with whose reference it will be discussed, was not altogether justified, for Poiret does not say that he had been able to examine a flower. The next reference to Afzelia is in Rees' CyclopMedical Officers of the Army of India. 3 authority without having actually considered what Smith wrote. DeCandolle has justly termed Smith's Afzelia a genus non satis notum; he might almost have treated it as a genus dubium. Seven years later this Afzelia was more fully dealt with by Guillemin, Perrottet and Richard in their Flor. Senegamb. Tent. (1833). The plant which these authors have identified with Afzelia africana Smith, has been accepted as such by subsequent writers. Their conclusion was arrived at after careful con- sideration and in spite of two material discrepancies between the characters exhibited by their plant and those postulated in the Prodromus article. Smith's Afzelia is described as having four petals, all clawed; the Afzelia of Guillemin and his colleagues does not possess four petals and has only one petal with a claw. It may therefore be reasonably doubted, if Smith's description be accurate, whether the Afzelia africana of the Prodromus is the same as the Afzelia africana of the Flor. Senegamb. The other discrepancy is as to the number of stamens. This difficulty, however, has mainly arisen from the neglect of the authors of the Flor. Sene- gamb to consult Smith's own account of Afzelia. Had this been done, they would have seen that Smith does not, as they suppose, aver that Afzelia has 8 fertile stamens, and would have found that what Smith actually does say, considered in the light of such collateral evidence as is available, in all probabil- ity implies that his plant, like their own, had 7 fertile stamens and two staminodes. The figure by Decaisne (Flor. Seneg. Tent. t. 57) shows, and the letter-press (loc. cit 264) accurately describes the actual structure of the flower in the species assumed to be Afzelia africana. In their generic definition, however, the staminal character is given as stamina 9-10, quorum 7-8 exserta fertilia, 2 capillaria sterilia. Thus Smith's actual statement that Afzelia may have 4 petals is excluded; while the statement that there may be 8 fertile stamens, which was neither made by Smith nor based on observation, is retained. The next important reference to Afzelia occurs in the Flora Nigritana 325, t. 34,35 (1849) where another species, A. bracteata Vog, has been described by Hooker and figured by Fitch. This species Hooker describes as having 64 Scientific Memoirs by assumed by him to be A. africana differs from A. bracteata in having no posterior staminodes. If this was his experience with any Afzelia, a doubt arises as to the specific identity of Baillon's A. africana either with the A. africana of Smith and DeCandolle or with the A. africana of Guillemin, Perrottet and Richard. In all the flowers of Guillemin's A. africana examined by the writer the two Posterior staminodes have been present. In any case the authority for the belief that Afzelia ever has 6 fertile stamens is this drawing by Fitch, whose accuracy neither Baillon nor the writer have succeeded in confirming; while the belief that Afzelia ever has 8 fertile stamens is not based on observation but on a deduction which is opposed to the evidence available. It would be rash to assert that the variation postulated by Bentham and Taubert will never be met with. There is, however, no proof that it has been met with hitherto either in A. bracteata or in A. africana; repeated examination of flowers of both these species by the writer confirms the accuracy of Baillon's diagram of the former and of Decaisne's diagram of the latter. According to Hiern, a variation in the number of the stamens is, however, characteristic of a third species, A. quanzensis Welw., which is stated (Cat. Pl. Welw. i. 288) to have 9Medical Officers of the Army of India. 5 the long claw; the stamens are 7 fertile, with a pair of staminodes between the uppermost pair of fertile stamens and the posterior petal. We have now to consider another group of species characterised by much compressed, thickly coriaceous, indehiscent pods not septate between the seeds, which though firm are not of bony hardness and have besides no arillus. The flowers have again one petal, but this is not very much longer than the calyx, the lamina is entire orbicular, longer than the short claw; the stamens are 3 fertile with an intercalated pair of staminodes and with usually 2 pairs of staminodes between the lateral fertile stamens and the posterior petal. The earliest notice of this group is the account by Rumphius in Herb. Amboin. iii, 21 (1750) of Metrosideros amboin- ensis, Caju Bessi or Amboina Iron Wood. In this chapter Rumphius describes three trees that appear to him to be distinct; he terms them Metrosideros amboin- ensis mas, M. amboinensis foemina and a form of foemina with longer, more numerous and more acute leaflets. The tree which Rumphius describes as Metrosideros amboinensis foemina is the usual form of the species for which the most familiar synonym is Afzelia bijuga A. Gray; that which he describes as mas is, perhaps, only another form of the same species. The variety of foemina to which he refers appears to be Intsia palembanica Miq., which is not the same thing, however, as Afzelia palembanica Baker. In 1790 Loureiro, Flor. Cochin- chin. 266, suggested that the trees described by Rumphius might be the same as his own Baryxylum rufum, a tree from N. Cochin China, whose affinities are still doubtful. This suggestion cannot be accepted. Loureiro's tree, whatever it may be, has a 5-lobed calyx and 10 stamens; the trees described by Rumphius have a 4-lobed calyx and only 3 fertile stamens. Sixteen years later Du Petit Thouars founded the genus Intsia on a Mas- carene tree for which the vernacular name in Madagascar is Intsi [Gen. Nov. Madagasc. (1806) n. 75, p. 22; Roemer, Collectanea (1809) n. 75, p. 212] Thouars suggested that his tree might possibly be the same as the Caju Bessi of Rumphius. Thouars provided no specific name for the Madagascar tree. DeCandolle, in the Prodromus, ii 509 (1826) accepted Thouars' genus and provided for the Madagascar species the name Intsia madagascariensis. Thouars' further suggestion he only partially and tentatively adopted by naming the Caju Bessi of Rumphius Intsia ? amboinensis. It now turns out that the suggestion of Thouars was right; the Intsi of Madagascar and the Caju Bessi of Amboina are one and the same widely distributed littoral species which extends from Madagascar and the Seychelles in the west to Fiji in the east. A typogra- phical error, left uncorrected in the Prodromus, attributes a 5-partite calyx to Intsia. The original diagnosis of Thouars correctly states that the calyx is 4-partite. B
6 Scientific Memoirs by This tree has given much trouble to taxonomists. In 1817 it was described and figured by Colebrooke (Trans. Linn. Soc. xii. 359. t. 17) as Macrolobium bijugum. The various species of Macrolobium were distributed by DeCandolle in the Prodromus under Vouapa with a 4-partite, and Outea with a 5-partite calyx. Not observing that Macrolobium bijugum was in reality identical with his own Intsia madagascariensis, DeCandolle re-named it Outea bijugua. Why it was placed in Outea rather than in Vouapa, is not exactly clear; Colebrooke had correctly described and figured the calyx as 4-partite. The name Outea bijuga was used by Wallich when in 1830 he distributed the East India Com- pany's herbarium. In 1832 was published Roxburgh's Flora indica; here we find that Roxburgh had treated this tree as a Fonesia (Saraca ), F. triandra, which is not, however; the same thing as Saraca triandra Baker. The next important reference to the genus is that by Blanco, Flor. Filipin. 368 (1837), where it is considered to be the same as Eperua Aubl.; Blanco's Eperua decandra, though described without fruit, is very obviously the wide-spread species Afzelia bijuga, Gray. The name indicates that Blanco had seen flowers with the vexillary stamen represented by a staminode, a condition that, in several hundreds of flowers examined by him, the writer has not yet met with. Blanco described a second species, Eperua falcata Blanco (loc. cit 369) not of Aublet, which, in the subsequent editions of his work, is termed E. rhom- boidea and which Vidal, at least, has since treated as an Afzelia. As its seeds are arillate, E. rhomboidea is not congeneric with E. aecandra; from Blanco's description either the tree ought not to be a Leguminous one, or he has in that description mixed up two trees, of different natural families. Nearly twenty years later three rather important references to the same tree appeared almost simultaneously. These are notices by A. Gray, But. of the U. S. Exped. 467, t. 51 (1854); by Miquel, Flor. Ind. Bat. i. 80 (1855); and by Hasskarl, Retzia i. 199 (1856). Gray's view was that the tree is congeneric with Afzelia Smith; he named it Afzelia bijuga in consequence. Miguel's view was that the genus intsia should be sustained; he accordingly adopted DeCan- dolle's name Intsia amboinensis, though by an oversight he attributed that name to Thouars.*Hasskarl, without apparently being aware of the fact, adopted the view that Roxburgh had held, and named the tree Fonesia monopetala. The view advocated by Gray is that which has been accepted in the Genera Plan- tarum by Bentham, in the Histoire des Plantes by Baillon, and in the Naturlishen Pflanzenfamilien by Taubert. The last mentioned author, it is true, adopts the name Intsia instead of Afzelia, but he does so on bibliographical *Baker (Flor Maurit 90) does the same as regards I. madagascariensis; Kuntze (Rev. Gen. Plant. i. 192) makes this mistake with both.

His Intsia is precisely Gray's and Bentham s Afzelia and is no more the natural Intsia of Thouars and Miquel than is Bentham's Afzelia the natural Afzelia of Guillemin, Perrottet and Richard. Notwithstanding the authority of the authors who have adopted and accepted this view, it is one that is neither natural nor convenient. For the view of Roxburgh and of Hasskarl, which has never received serious attention, there is quite as much to be said as there is for the view proposed by Gray and practically universally accepted. Fonesia Roxb., As. Res. iv, 355 (1795), we now know to be the Linnean Saraca . Saraca differs from Intsia in having no petal and in having usually 7 fertile stamens; the two have, however, pods and seeds that are identical. Afzelia and Intsia agree as to petals; as regards stamens they differ as much as Saraca and Intsia differ; the two have, moreover, wholly dissimilar pods and seeds. In the matter of habit, foliage, inflorescence Saraca Afzelia and Intsia are not separable; as regards calyx the three are essentially alike. If the differences as to stamens are insufficient for generic distinction as between Intsia and Afzelia , they must be equally valueless as between Saraca and Intsia . Only three sets of characters are thus left us; those to be obtained from the corolla, the fruit and the seed respectively. As regards Saraca and Intsia we find the corolla esse- tially different, the fruit and the seed alike. As regards Intsia and Afzelia we find the corolla the same, he fruit and the seed both essentially different. If then Intsia be distinct from Saraca , it follows that it must be even more distinct from Afzelia and the view of Miquel is vindicated. As a matter of fact, both Bentham and Taubert give sectional value to these differential characters; Baillon even admits that they are subgeneric. To adopt the view of Miquel is only to take another and necessary step in the same direction. Having shown that the group of species, of which Afzelia bijuga is the type, constitutes a distinct genus Intsia apart from Afzelia, it has now to be shown that there is another group of species, usually treated as generically separable, which must be merged in Afzelia . The type of this group is the tree on which Miquel, Flor. Ind. Bat. i, 85 (1855), founded the genus Pahudia. The material at Miquel's disposal was barely adequate for the purpose, because he had not seen fruit or seed. Nevertheless, the genus was, so far as this material went, well Characterised in the original definition. As an after-thought Miquel in the same work (page 1080) added a second species, P. Hasskarliana, to his original P. javanica To accommodate this second species, Miquel modified his original diagnosis so materially as to mar the natural limits of his genus. As a matter of fact his P. Hasskarliana is Hasskarl's Fonesia monopetala; that is to say, is Roxburgh's F. triandra, Colebrooke's Macrolubium bijugum, DeCandolle's Outea bijuga, Miquel's own Intsia amboinensis. To make matters, if possible, more
8 Scientific Memoirs by complicated, Miquel treated his own Pahudia, when he did get fruits, as Intsia; his Intsia puberula (Flor. Ind. Bat. Suppl. 290) is certainly a Pahudia and is probably his own P. javanica. Bentham, Gen. Plant. i. 58o (1865) accepted the genus, therefore, only as it was originally defined, remarking, how- ever, that it appears to differ from Afzelia merely in having monadelphous stamens. Baillon, Hist. des Plantes ii, (1869), has (page 112, doubtfully; page 184, definitely) included Pahudia in Afzelia. Kurz, in dealing with another species, P. xylocarpa, has, Fourn. As. Soc. Beng. xlv.2. 290 (1876) and For. Flor. Brit. Burma i 413, satisfactorily vindicated the right of Miquel's Pahudia to gen- eric rank, as apart from the Afzelia of Indian systematic treatises, all the species of which are species of lntsia and not of Afzelia. But Kurz's account of the pod and the seed, which is quite accurate, indicates that Baillon's proposal is not only justifiable but necessary; the pod and the seed of Pahudia are identical with those of Afzelia proper. The differences between Afzelia and Pahudia are that the posterior petal of Pahudia is, like that of Intsia, small, not 2-lobed, with a claw that is shorter than the lamina, while the filaments, instead of being free as in Afzelia africana and A. bracteata are united below in a sheath split along the upper side. The number of fertile stamens is, however, the same in Pahudia as in Afzelia, and we find between the staminal sheath and the petal in Pahudia the same pair of sterile filaments that are met with between the uppermost fertile stamens and the petal in Afzelia. Hien's discovery that in the African Afzelia quanzensis the filaments, in place of being free, are more or less united at the base invalidates any proposal to consider the difference between free and connate filaments a generic difference. The only diagnostic characters therefore left are those provided by the posterior petal. But these differences, though striking, afford after all only relative characters and, While we may probably be justified in considering Afzelia and Pahudia as sectionally separable, we cannot treat them as subgenerically, still less as generically distinct. This demonstration of the true natural relationships of Intsia, Afzelia and Pahudia involves unfortunately some dislocation of synonymy. This, so far as Intsia is concerned, cannot be avoided. That genus is much too natural and dis- tinct to remain longer unrecognised. Some of its species have already been treated as Intsias; with these, it is merely a question of restoring the original name. Unfortunately, as regards Afzelia and Pahudia, which now prove to be congeneric, the matter is more difficult. The writer proposes, as the least of two evils, to employ Miquel's name in preference to Smith's one. It is true that the name Pahudia is less familiar than the name Afzelia and is not so old. Afzelia Smith, is not, however, the only Afzelia, nor is it the oldest one. Wett- stein (Naturlich. Pflanzenfam. ) and Hooker and Jackson (Index Kewens. ),
Medical Officers of the Army of India. 9 though fully aware that the original Afzelia Gmelin is the oldest name for Seymeria Pursh, have refrained from reinstating it, because the species of that genus are better known as Seymerias. Had there been in the present instance no question of reduction, the writer, whose sympathies are wholly with the attitude of Hooker and of Wettstein, would have proposed that the name Afzelia Smith should continue to be employed for the genus first properly characterised by Guil- lemin, Perrottet and Richard. Seeing, however, that a reduction must take place, for if Afzelia is not merged in Pahudia, Pahudia must be absorbed by Afzelia, it seems better to adopt, as the name for the genus, that term to which least excep- tion can be taken. Not only is there the difficulty that the existence of an older Afzelia creates, there are two important practical reasons for the abandon- ment of the name Afzelia Smith. The familiarity of that name, which under ordinary circumstances would be one of the strongest pleas for its retention, is here one of the best reasons for its suppression. That familiarity is mainly due, not to its use in connexion with the 3 or 4 African species to which its employ- ment in the Senegal. and Niger Floras has rendered it applicable, but to its use in connexion with the 5 or 6 Malayan species of Intsia to which it should never have been applied. Moreover, there is still some dubiety as regards Smith's Afzelia. None of the species hitherto found possesses a corolla like that des- cribed by Smith. However satisfied we may feel that these African Afzelias do really belong to Smith's genus of that name, there is no certainty that even yet we have been made acquainted with his original species. If we have, then Smith's original characterisation was so imperfect as almost to justify, on this ground alone, the abandonment of his name. The fact that a species of Sindora has been tentatively placed by Baker in Afzelia (Maingay had already in the field considered this particular species an Intsia, while more recently Koorders and Valeton, realising that the tree in question cannot be an Afzelia or Intsia, have suggested that it may be a Pahudia ) neces- sitates a reference to this genus. The seeds of this species, as of all the species of Sindora where the seeds are known, have exactly the structure of the seeds of Pahudia and of Afzelia proper, and are quite unlike those of any Intsia. The fruits are, moreover, in this as in most if not all of the species, dehiscent. These facts lend colour to the idea which Koorders and Valeton have entertained (Bijdr. ii. 27); their suggestion is not, however, really more acceptable than those of Maingay and Baker. The calyx-tube and disk in this plant are very short; the fruit is only loculicidally dehiscent by the dorsal suture; the pods have thin coriaceous valves not thick woody ones. The stamens of Sindora are also very different from those of Afzelia or Pahudia. In the first place the tenth or vexillary stamen is represented by a free filament between the ovary and the C

The writer at one time was prepared to adopt the view of Miquel rather than that of Bentham (Fourn. As. Soc. Beng. lXVi. 2. 202). Both authors worked with incomplete material before them, and the conclusion of each was, under the circumstances, equally natural. Further study of the sub-order C12 Scientific Memoirs by Outea DC.

The tree collected by Diepenhorst in Sumatra and published by Miquel as Intsia puberula, of which the writer has not seen any specimen, cannot, from Miquel's own description, be an Intsia, because the pods are woody and the seeds are arillate. The fact that Miquel indicates that the arillus extends further up one side of the seed than the other and that the leaves are puberulous, coupled with the description given of the shape of the leaves, makes it almost certain, that the tree is Miquel's own Pahudia javanica and not a hitherto uncharac- terised species of Pahudia. 2.

PLATE I. FIG. I. AnophelesInoculation of Malaria by Anopheles, BY C. F. FEARNSIDE, CAPTAIN, I.M.S., Superintendent, Central Prison, Rajahmundri, Madras Presidency. The Central Prison of Rajahmundri is one of the most " malarious " jails in India, and from the years 188020 Scientific Memoirs by by anopheles which had been fed in Rome on the blood of a patient which con- tained benign spring-tertian parasites. These two gentlemen developed tertian ague, and the experiment gives absolute proof of mosquito-malaria infection, because neither of those persons had had ague previously or been exposed to it. We cannot hope for such clear proof of the malarial-bearing properties of the anopheles, because in India few, either European or Native, have escaped malaria. The possibility of relapse, or collateral contagion, cannot therefore be excluded when dealing with anopheles infection in India. Care was taken to select persons in good health and those who had not had fever for a long time. METHOD OF FEEDING THE ANOPHELES. The anopheles are hatched in the usual way in a glass bottle, the larvæ having been collected from some puddle. From this bottle the requisite number of mosquitoes is taken and placed in a Bohemian beaker, the mouth of which is covered with a piece of thin muslin. Provided the mosquitoes are fed daily or every second day by apposing the moistened muslin to the forearm, the mosquitoes will live for weeks in this cage. This kind of mosquito, whether newly hatched or a few days old, whether in the middle of the day or in the dusk, is always greedy for blood. For "obstedric " reasons the female anopheles, like all other lady mosquitoes, requires water wherein to complete or ease her " confine- ment." For this purpose a dish, such as the ones used for washing photographic negatives, is employed, and into it is poured a little fresh water. The beaker containing the mosquitoes; is placed with the mouth resting in the water and the other end on the edge of the dish. There will thus be a little pool at the edge of the beaker in which her ladyship can deposit her ova. To inoculate anyone who volunteers to be bitten and risk malarial fever, the moistened muslin has only to be applied to the forearm on or after the ninth day and the anopheles will do the rest. SPECIES OF ANOPHELES EMPLOYED. There are six varieties of anopheles in Rajahmundri, and of these I have used one which is commonly found all the year round. The accompanying-sketch, Pláte I, with the description opposite, gives a fairly good idea of what it is like. They travel long distances, whether by flight or by other means of conveyance. In October, 1899, while proceeding from Madras to Rajahmundri by rail, two of this species located themselves inside my solah topi and travelled all the way

The malarial hæmam22 Scientific Memoirs by In the blood of birds affected by proteosoma, MacCallum showed that there were two kinds of cells: (a ) a hyaline which becomes flagellated (male element, chromatozoid) and (b ) a granular cell (the female element). The union of these two gives rise to Ross' zygote which develope in the stomach wall of the mos- quito, Culex pipiens. In the blood of patients suffering from tertian ague there exist two similar forms of cells: (a ) microgamete or flagellate (male); (b ) macrogamete or female cell. The impregnation of the macrogamete (female) by the flagella (spermatozoid, chromatozoid) of the microgamete gives rise to the Zygote (of spring-tertian ague) which develops in the stomach wall of anopheles. A brief description of these two elements observed by me here may be interesting. 1. Microgamete (male element), Plate II, fig. 3. PLATE III. Fig.1 .PLATE III.

26 Scientific Memoirs by In table I will be found the results of feeding 24 anopheles on malarial blood, viz., 17 on blood containing summer-autumn parasites and crescents and 7 on blood containing benign spring-tertian parasites. Of the former, 9 anopheles were found to contain Ross' cysts in various stages of growth. The absence of cysts in those mosquitoes fed on the blood of convict No. 9598 (crescentic bodies absent) may have been due to the absence of crescents or to my having over- looked them or damaged them during dissection. There were three failures in those fed on the blood of convict No. 1718 which contained crescents. This may have been brought about by three causes: either (I) the crescents were old, (2) or immature, (3) or the large doses of quinine administered daily interfered with the evolution. I attribute the failure to the last named cause, because many crescents were "ripe." Excluding the three anopheles fed on convict No. 9598 for the reason stated, we find 9 out of 13, or 70 per cent. approximately, infected. This is not pleasant to think of but it is worse with those anopheles fed on spring- tertian, because all became infected. Quinine was avoided when feeding the latter. My later experiments (not yet tabulated) give still better results with the summer-autumn variety of hæmamMedical Officers of the Army of India. 27 Table II-A. Spring-Tertian.

Medical Officers of the Army of India. 33 Practical Conclusions. * Campagna Romana. Grassi, Celli and others basing their suggestions on the experiment of Drs. Low and Sambon, who spent two months in the most feverish part of Italy * and who by shutting themselves up in a mosquito-proof hut at sundown, thereby escaping malarial fever, propose perforated zinc houses (mosquito-proof) to dwell in. Few persons in India, after a noonday temperature of 117º F. in the shade would care to shut themselves up in such a cage. To put the native population, men, women and children, who sometimes have only sufficient money to keep body and soul together, under mosquito nets or in mosquito-proof houses is out of the question. To cleanse the " Augean stable " of anopheles is a task only possible to Hercules himself. Get rid of puddles by all means, but I doubt whether, even if the whole population of India were put to the work of filling up all the puddles during the rains, the results would justify the expense. The paddyfields, which are the main source of food throughout a great part of India, will have to be abolished. Is the population to starve in the mean- time ? Get rid of all the pools and puddles in India, and you will only find that the anopheles will change its habitat; or abolish anopheles altogether, and how do we know that we shall be rid of malaria ? My view is that the malarial parasite is trimorphic and that there is a phase (extra-corporeal) yet to be discovered. The means of preventing the spread of malaria lie in two directions: (1) in the free use of quinine; (2) in the segregation of all suffering from ague. Quinine, in a few cases I have noted, prevents the impregnation of the macro- gamete by the flagellum of the microgamete and the zygotes fail to develop in the stomach of the anopheles. Quinine is therefore useful in checking the endo- genous as well as the exogenous evolution of the Laveran's bodies. The segre- gation of infected individuals will be as difficult a task as the destruction of the anopheles. The 27th January 1901.

Commensalism among Zoophytes. There are no marine animals that are more ready to attach themselves to others than are the Actiniarian Zoophytes. Many of these attachments may be conveniently classed as casual, others without doubt exhibit the bond of mutual necessity and include some of the most perfect instances of commensalism known; while between these two extremes there are numerous gradations. One of the most finished cases of commensalism that has come under my own observation, in these seas, is that existing between an undescribed species of colony-forming sea-anemones belonging, or closely related, to the genus Mamil- lifera, and the hermit-crab Chlaenopagurus andersoni. This hermit-crab grows to a considerable size (a large male being 63 mm. in length from the rostrum to the point where the flexure of the abdomen begins), and lives at a considerable depth (102 fathoms off the Malabar coast) where we know that mollusk-shells large enough to accommodate an animal of this size are uncommon. The protection, then, that this hermit-crab requires is furnished, not by a shell at all, but by a sheet or blanket formed by the soft flexible coenosarc of a colony of polyps. The hermit-crab holds the sheet over its back, by tucking one end of it under its telson and hook-like swimmerets, and by grasp- ing the corners of the other end in the pincers of its penultimate pair of thoracic legs. When the full protection of the sheet is not required, these legs are flexed in repose, and the sheet lies loose on the hermit-crab's abdomen; but when the hermit-crab wishes to conceal itself, it extends and pronates these legs, so that the sheet is drawn right over its cephalo-thorax. Captain A. R. S. Anderson, who observed the animal in life, says that this action is particularly neatly per- formed. The examination of a large series of specimens, in all stages of growth, shows that the partnership begins, at an early period of the life of both animals, by the settling of the parent-polyp of the colony on the telson of the little hermit-crab. As the hermit-crab grows, the investing polyp increases in size, pari passu, by budding, so that in all stages of its existence the hermit-crab has a cloak of suitable dimensions. On the other hand, the nutrition and growth of the polyps is assured by the fact that the agency of the crab changes them from sedentary to locomotive animals. The well-known partnership that subsists between the colony-forming sea- anemone Epizoanthus and the deep-sea hermit-crab Parapagurus pilosimanus , has been often illustrated in the dredgings of the 'Investigator.' In this case, as has been explained by Verrill, Bouvier, and others, the partnership begins. L

That the polyps are not parasites is proved by the facts (1) that the nutritive zooids of the colony have a proper mouth and a prominent peristome fully equipped with tentacles for catching food, and (2) that in any colony numerous zooids may be found with their gastric cavity crammed with food, which they must have caught for themselves. In the following six cases of symbiosis, in which Zoophytes are concerned, the element of reciprocity seems to be wanting, so that it is doubtful whether they should be cited as cases of true commensalism:Medical Officers of the Army of India. 43 noticed, exactly corresponding in colour with their host, and undoubtedly modi- fied, both in colour and in form, to suit their habitat. In Calypterinus allmani the polyps are arranged in whorls, hanging head downwards and protected by wing-like calcareous shields. The whorls are so close set along the stem that the lateral shields of the successive series form by their overlapping a sort of tube, and in this tube the worm is securely impacted, as in a shell of its own.

Several instances of definite partnerships between Crustacea and Sponges, Crustacea and Zoophytes, and Crustacea and Echinoderms have already been noticed: a few cases in which Crustacea have been found commensal with Mollusca, have to be mentioned. The alliance, known from the time of Aristotle, between crabs of the genus Pinnoteres and various species of bivalve mollusks, is frequently illustrated in these seas. From a living individual of Lima indica , dredged off the coast of Travancore, in 450 fathoms, Captain A. R. S. Anderson took a Pinnoteres (P. abyssicola ), the first to be found in deep water. Pinnoteres purpureus (a new species) has been found in an Andaman spe- cies of oyster; and Pinnoteres mactricola (another new species) in the common Mactra violacea. The equally well known league that exists between Pontonia and bivalve mollusks is exemplified in the Laccadive Islands, where I found a male and egg- laden female of this little crustacean harbouring in the mantle-chamber of a common species of Tridacna, verifying the observations of Dana, Peters, Hender- son and others. I imagine that the association of certain tubicolous Annelids of the Serpulid family with certain defenceless and sluggish crabs is a genuine case of commen- salism, for the calcareous tubes of the Annelids must be a protection and disguise to the crab, while the attachment to a locomotive host must benefit the sedentary worm. The Oxyrhynch crab Encephaloides Armstrongi, which is one of the characteristic inhabitants of the 100 fathom contour-line, in these seas, furnishes a very good instance of this commensalism, for old adults are almost always copiously encrusted with worm-tubes, although naturally these are not to be seen on younger individuals that are still liable to moult. Besides the papers previously cited, the following contain references to Crustacean commensals:46 Scientific Memoirs by Richard, Sur les Parasites et les Commencaux des crustacés, in Arch. de Parasitol II.

On Certain Secondary Sexual Characters in Certain Bony Fishes. Darwin in the Descent of Man (2nd ed., pages 330-347) has collected numerous observations on this subject. To the cases, quoted by him, in which the male is more brilliantly coloured or highly ornamented than the female, probably with the object of attracting the female, the " Investigator" is able to add the following:54 Scientific Memoirs by On one occasion I encountered a male and female in copula, in a hole in a coral-rock, and captured them, the male biting savagely, though not quitting his hold of the female. The edges of the vent and genital pore of the female were found to be swollen, everted, and inflamed, with eggs protruding from the pore. De Joannis (Revue Zoologique par la Societe Cuvierienne, 1839, p. 52) states of Anguilla that they are frequently found in swarms, when he believes that they are pairing.

As is well known, the impregnation of the ovum in this group is always effected internally. In some Elasmobranchs, such as the Dog-fishes, the true Rays, and the Chimæras, the female lays large eggs, enclosed each in a tough horny envelope which is often of fantastic shape or curiously ornamented. In others58 Scientific Memoirs by The placenta, formed by the yolk-sack, is a compact arborescent mass adherent to a vascular disk on the uterine wall near its after end: its cord is about 18 inches long.

It is interesting to observe that this organ of defenceMedical Officers of the Army of India. 63 and when, on my closer approach, it endeavoured to go further in, there was evoked from the rightful tenant in the depths an angry whirr of remonstrance. Thereafter I was often able to elicit the sound by catching an individual and forc- ing it into a strange burrow: the captive was always most unwilling to enter, but if he were forced in, the rightful owner would very soon let him know, by a vigorous chiding from the stridulating organ, that he was not wanted. In this deeply burrowing species one use of the stridulating apparatus thus appears to be to warn away trespassers and obviate the risk of suffocation; for if a lot of crabs were to crowd into one burrow they would all, probably, be stifled. In Ocypoaa ceratophthalma, which does not burrow deeply, this cannot be the use of the organ. Captain A. R. S. Anderson, who heard this species croaking like frogs, on one of the Laccadive Islands, says that the noise was being made without any apparent cause. I may mention that my predecessor here, the late Prof. J. Wood-Mason, who first called my attention to the musical powers of the Crustacea, discovered what, though their function has not been verified, are probably strepitant organs, in a small species of Peneus closely related to Peneus velutinus, in a species of Squilla which he named S. stridulans, and in a species of Carcinoplacoid crab to which he gave the significant name Psopheticus stridulans. Moreover there are several species of Hermit-crabs, some of which are re- ferred to in the literature, while others are not, in which organs that can only be useful for crepitation exist. Finally I may refer to the Catometope crabs of the genera Macrophthalmus and Metaplax, the " musical organs " of which have been described by de Man. Here the sound, as in the majority of stridulating insects, seems to have a sexual meaning, since the organ that makes it is found only in the male. Perhaps some " Investigator " Naturalist may have an opportunity of noting what the sound is like, and in what circumstances it is heard, for these crabs are common enough in the creeks of Indian deltas. 2.64 Scientific Memoirs by bones, (2) by vibrations of the air-bladder and its gaseous contents, (3) by the contraction of intrinsic muscles upon the distended air-bladder acting as a reson- ator, (4) by the friction of special surfaces of the vertebral and interspinous bones, or of enlarged fin-rays in their sockets, (5) by the forcible expulsion of the gaseous contents of the air-bladder, where a duct exists.

The geographical distribution of such a strictly littoral genus is interesting and suggestive, but for the moment our concern is with the habits and larval forms of its species. The habits and larval stages of H . emerita have been fully described by S. I. Smith in the Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Sciences, Volume III, 1874-78, page 311, and the first larval stage by Walter Faxon in the Bulle- tin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard, Volume V, 1878-79, page 253. According to Prof. Smith, Hippa emerita is gregarious, burrowing in the loose sand near low-water-mark and using the hinder end of its body for this pur- pose. Individuals placed in a suitable aquarium at once plunged beneath the sand, but soon worked back towards the surface, and at length came to rest in a perpendicular position, with the tips of the antennules and eyes just showing above the surface. While in this position the currents of water from the gill-cham- bers kept the overlying sand in constant motion. The peculiarly long antennæ were never seen extended, but were always kept tucked in between the maxil- lipeds. These remarks apply without modification to Hippa asiatica, which species I had frequent opportunities of observing when the " Investigator" was survey- ing the Orissa coast in 1889. According to Mr. Faxon, the larva of Hippa emerita leaves the egg as a Zoaea with a smooth oval carapace which is produced anteriorly to form a broad rather blunt rostrum but which has no dorsal or lateral spines. The abdomen (judging from the figure) is bent beneath the carapace, and is described as ending in a large broad plate-like telson, the convex posterior edge of which is fringed with minute teeth. Two pairs of small antennæ are present, as well as mandibles and two pairs of small and the only other appendages present, besides the enormous eyes, are the two pairs of large biramous maxillipeds used in loco- motion. The newly-hatched larva of Hippa asiatica, which I had opportunities of examining-in January 1889, corresponds almost exactly with that of H. emerita as described and figured by Faxon: the chief difference being in the rostral spine which is longer in Hippa asiatica. (b ) As far as I can ascertain, the larva of Thenus orientalis though it is known to be a Phyllosoma (see Richters in Zeitschrift für wissenschaftliche Zoologie, XXIII, 1873, page 623) has not been described.
66 Scientific Memoirs by The newly-hatched larva of this Loricate, as I observed it in the month of January, is a Phyllosoma 1/12th of an inch long. Its body is divided into three regions, namely (1) a broad crescentic cephalo-thoracic portion, (2) a postero-tho- racic portion, with posteriorly convergent sides, consisting of five distinct seg- ments, and (3) a very short stump-like abdomen bearing a pair of foliaceous, lobes at its abruptly-truncated end. The appendages (including buds) of the anterior region are a pair of huge long-stalked pyriform eyes, two pairs of antennæ, a pair of toothed mandibles, three pairs of small papillæMedical Officers of the Army of India. 67 (b ) Coenobita. 68 Scientific Memoirs by the bodyMedical Officer of the Army of India. 69 They are gregarious and amphibious, living in warrens, each individual hav- ing a burrow of its own. Though, as a rule, they do not wander far from their burrows into which, when alarmed, they fly with wonderful speed, they may some- times be seen marching together in large companies across the sand. As has been pointed out by many observers, both sexes are alike in having one of the chelipeds greatly enlarged, and in all the species but one there is, on the " palm " of the longer cheliped, a series of fine teeth forming a sort of file which can be scraped across another more or less distinct ridge on the ischiopodite of that cheliped. The whole organ has a general resemblance to the stridu- lating apparatus of certain insects, and indeed it is usually spoken of as the " stridulating-ridge " or " musical organ." So far as I know, however, the sound that this stridulating organ is capable of producing has been actually heard only by Dr. Ortmann, Captain A. R. S. Anderson and myself. I shall refer to it again in the section on Sounds produced by certain Marine Animals. Five species of Ocypoda occur on the shores of India and its islands. I here wish to mention only Ocypoda rotundata, which is found in the neighbour- hood of Karachi, and O. ceratophthalma, which occurs throughout the Pacific from the east coast of Africa to the Sandwich Islands. These two species, so far as our observations on the " Investigator " go, are peculiar in not always digging deep burrows, but sometimes only partially burying themselves in hollows. O. ceratophthalma when thus crouching part-buried, looks like a stone embed- ded in the sand, a fact which appears to be of interest as suggesting that the habit of seeking protection by burrowing deeply may have been the outcome of a habit of scratching a hollow in which to crouch in a lifeless attitude. 5. Some Protective Disguises among the Higher Crustacea. The last paragraph leads us on naturally to this subject, which is so large a one that, if it were to be fully treated, nearly half the higher Crustacea of these seas might be mentioned. Moreover the subject has no particular novelty, so that I shall confine myself to the statement of a few specific instances in which I myself have observed the efficacy of protective colouration, sculpture, and attitude. Of the small feeble and defenceless crabs that live among coral shingle off certain rocky parts of the coasts of India and Ceylon, there are many species which, at first sight, look exactly like little bits of dead coral: they have the same mottled colouration, the same worm-eaten appearance, and often also they are encrusted with foraminiferal growths of some species of Polytrema. When the multifarious contents of the trawl are turned out on deck these little crabs. lie motionless in unlife-like attitudes, and might easily escape notice among the bits of shingle.
70 Scientific Memoirs by Among Oxystome crabs that have this singularly effectual disguise are Oreophorus reticulatus and alcicornis, ActMedical Officers of the Army of India. 71 The "Investigator" has, so far, dredged only one female specimen of Huenia proteus, and on the carapace of that specimen a small fucus, with fronds just like these lobes, was growing. Possibly some of the cases previously mentioned as doubtful instances of commensalism,72 Scientific Memoirs by reported from the Sandwich Islands and the Bay of Panama. Its occurrence in Australia is doubtful. This wide geographical range, considered as an isolated fact, is so strange as almost to suggest some mistaken identifications, but as I have compared the Indian specimen with specimens from the Mediterranean and the North Sea, there is no doubt about its occurrence in these seas. Moreover, it is not an isolated fact. In the Summary published in these Memoirs in 1899, as well as in the Account of the Investigator Deep Sea Madreporaria, and in still more detail in the Account of the Investigator Deep Sea Fishes, I have collected a number of instances of fishes and Marine Invertebrates that have a somewhat similar distribution, and have shown the bearing of the whole mass of evidence upon Suess theory of the wide-spreading Mediterranean Sea of Tertiary times. V.Medical Officers of the Army of India. 73 long fin-rays waving like fronds, it does, as I know from experience, often escape the notice even of those whose business it is to ransack rocks for specimens. On one occasion I chanced to drive a Pterois volitans from its retreat among the rocks into the open blue water of a deep pool, whereupon its numerous cross-bands, which ordinarily show no trace of that colour, immediately became blue in alternate streaks of dark and light hue. The Siluroid fish Plotosus arab is able with its stout reversely-serrated dorsal spine (whether its similar pectoral spines are equally dangerous, or not, I cannot say) to inflict a wound that, even if promptly treated, can disable a man for several days, as I know from personal experience. According to Day, the wound from this spine is said to cause "phlegmonous inflammation, or even tetanus". The colours of this objectionable fish are usually described as chestnut brown with two bluish-white longitudinal bands. As a matter of fact, all the living specimens that I have seen have a most startling uniform of deep purple brown with two bright yellow bands along the body, suggesting the idea of a longitudinally-striped hornet. Though I do not know that any experiments have been made, I am prepared to assert, from my own experience, that this singularly conspicuous colouration has a warning value. I may mention here that I decalci- fied and sectioned several specimens, but could find no trace of any special poison-gland, so that, as is generally stated, it must be the ordinary mucus of the skin that is poisonous. The Nudibranch Gastropod Mollusks of the reefs of these seas furnish many excellent instances of protective colouration, some of those species that are found on encrusting sponges and soft corals being invisible while on their hosts. One can also observe on these reefs cases of warning colouration among Nudibranch Mollusks, more than one showy species having a disagreeable aroma- tic smell. The observations of Professor W. A. Herdman on protective and warningly- coloured Mollusks are so conclusive, that I need not regret my inability to name the Indian species that I have noticed to be thus protected. A little species of, I think, the genus Bulla, that is found in tidal pools on some of the Andaman shores must, however, be specially recorded, as to a most brilliant colouration of emerald green with bright orange spots, it unites a most disagreeable and persistent pungent musky odour74 Scientific Memoirs by it was lying exposed in clear shallow pools, a most conspicuous object in spite of its small size. VI.Medical Officers of the Army of India. 75 The file-fish Balistes maculatus, which one often meets far from land, has been taken by us in the open sea with its, stomach full of Pteropods. In its habit of shadowing drift timber this fish shows decided pelagic proclivities, to which the Pteropods in the stomach seem also to bear witness. The most curious feeding that I have ever noticed was in a case of the little boring sea-urchin Echinostrephus molare, an individual of which species, that I once dug out of a hole in coral rock in the neighbourhood of a temporary an- chorage of the "Investigator," was eating boiled rice that had been thrown over- board. Not only was it eating it, but it had stored up a supply in its burrow. It will, of course, be said that, the rice must have been accidentally washed into the burrow during the absence of the sea-urchin, but I satisfied myself that it would have been difficult for this to take place, and that no other rice was strewn about in the neighbourhood. As a matter of fact, the discovery of boiled rice in such a situation was so strange and unexpected that I had to resort to the iodine test to solve the puzzle. To discover food, and then to lay up a store of it, perhaps implies the posses- sion of more sensation, activity, and intelligence than most people are willing to accede to a sea-urchin. But the experiments of Romanes (Journ. Linn. Soc. Zool., XVII, 1884) seem to show that star-fishes are guided to food by some sense akin to smell, a conclusion supported by Prouho (Archives de Zool. Ex- perim (2) VIII. 1890, page xxxvi) who localizes this sense in the tube-feet at the end of the rays. Prouho (Arch. Zool. Exper. v. 1887, page 229) had pre- viously noticed that the sea-urchin Dorocidaris papillata is omnivorous, and exercises some intelligence in the search for food. Sluiter (v. Natuurkund. Tijdschr. Nederland-Ind. XLVIII, 1889, page 285) mentions a sea-urchin that showed considerable activity in an aquarium, and a star-fish that displayed a certain amount of dexterity. Nagel (Biologisches Centralblatt, 1894, page. 543) maintains that Echinoderms, like many other marine animals, can taste and smell. VII.76 Scientific Memoirs by Medical Officers of the Army of India. On Great Coco Island, which lies northward of the Andamans and is about six miles long and about a mile and a half in greatest breadth, and is covered for the most part with dense jungle, I, on two occasions and in different spots, saw a crow-pheasant that appeared to be incapable of flight, as it made its escape by running; and it occurred to me that these birds might belong to a flightless island race, in accordance with the explanation given by Darwin. I still adhere to this opinion, and hope that some "Investigator" Natural- ist will follow up these observations, It has been said that on the neighbouring islet known as Table Island, the crow-pheasants have a particularly strong flight. If this is so, it affords a sort of "control" experiment; for Table Island, which has an area of less than half a square mile, has been largely cleared of jungle for the sake of the light-house, and on a very small island, deficient in cover, one would expect the birds to be strong rather than weak flyers. On Pitti Bank, which is a little uninhabited sand-cay of one of the most submerged of the Laccadive atolls, we found, at the end of November 1891, vast swarms of a large spescies of sea-tern breeding. There were nestlings in every stage, but no eggs. Both old and young birds were quite free from fear, the old birds, almost alighting on our shoulders as we landed, and the young birds even those with their first plumage complete, submitting to capture without any resistance. Dreadful havoc had been wrought among the young birds, chiefly by large CSome observations on Spirillum Fever, as seen in the Monkey. Macacus Radiatus. GEORGE LAMB, M.B., (GLASG.). CAPTAIN, I. M. S. (From the Research Laboratory, Bombay ). It has long been known that monkeys are susceptible to infection with the spirillum of Obermeier, and that an injection of fresh material containing this spirillum, whether taken from man or monkey, produces in this latter animal an attack of fever fairly analogous to that which occurs naturally in the human sub- ject. These facts were first demonstrated by Carter1working in Bombay in 1877 and have since been confirmed by Koch and other observers. Moreover, since the date of Carter's original publication spirillum fever as seen in the monkey, artificially infected, has been carefully studied by many investigators with a view to throwing more light on its pathology and especially with a view of building up a theory as to the cause of the crisis and of the relapses, both of which phenomena are such distinctive features of this disease in man. I shall have occasion to refer to these observations later on. Carter's observations2on spirillum fever in artificially infected monkeys are briefly summarised as follows:78 Scientific Memoirs by (4) A relapse was rare. He observed this to occur only in two animals out of a total of 24 cases observed throughout. (5) He states that no immunity seemed to follow an attack of this fever, as monkeys inoculated with fresh spirillum material two or three weeks after the crisis, went through a second specific attack in no way different from the primary attack. I have been able for the most part to confirm these observations and to further extend them in several directions. That they require, however, some modifications will be apparent from the results of the experiments which I have now to put on record. I have notes of 29 primary inoculations of spirillum material in the monkey. Eight of these inoculations were made with human blood and 21 with blood taken from other monkeys. The blood injected was collected at different times during the course of the specific fever and always contained actively motile spirilla. The quantity used in each case varied from 0.25 to 4 c.c. When human blood was the material employed, it was taken, by means of a sterile syringe, from the median basilic vein and injected into the monkey immediately after withdrawal. When the material was got from a monkey, the blood was collected by means of a canula inserted into the brachial, carotid or femoral artery: it was received into a test tube containing a solution of citrate of soda3so as to prevent clotting: it was injected always within 15 minutes after its withdrawal. In two instances intra-peritoneal injection was employed: in all other cases the material was inoculated subcutaneously in the pectoral region. Out of 29 inoculations there were 5 failures, thus giving 83 per cent. of successful infections. Three failures out of 8 attempts followed injection of human material, i.e., 63 per cent. of successes, while there were 2 failures out of 21 inoculations with monkey's blood, i.e., 91 per cent. of successes. No explanation can be offered to account for all the failures that occurred. That they were not due to a permanent natural resistance possessed by the monkeys under experiment, is shown by the fact that all these animals were attacked with the characteristic fever as a result of a second inoculation of spirillum blood, at intervals ranging from 8 to 15 days after the unsuccessful injection. In the case of one of the failures when monkey's blood was employed as inoculation material, a diminution in the virulence of the spirilla as a result of " passage " through a series of these animals can be brought forward, as we shall see later, as an adequate explanation. But neither this explanation nor that of an insufficient dose can account for the other unsuccessful attempts. For in the second abortive case, when monkey's blood was used, the same amount of material injected from the same syringe gave rise to a typical attack of spirillum

Further, in the failures when human blood was employ- ed, the blood was taken in all instances from patients who were in the same stage of the disease as those who had furnished the material for the successful inoculations. Moreover, the blood in all cases contained actively motile spirilla.

Medical Officers of the Army of India. 81 The average of the counts made in the 17 cases, in which the relative pro- portion of the polynuclear cells to the other white cells was estimated from day to day during the period of infection, may be tabulated as follows:82 Scientific Memoirs by (6) Monkey S-11 Medical Officers of the Army of India. 83 (3) Monkey S-22 84 Scientific Memoirs by From these experiments it is seen, therefore, that injection of spirillum material within a period of 3 weeks after the crisis of the primary attack was followed by a typical attack of spirillum fever in only 11 per cent. of cases, and after a period of 1 month in 80 per cent. of the cases. This latter number, it will be remembered, is practically the same percentage of successful injections obtained as a result of inoculation of spirillum blood in fresh monkeys. It is evident, therefore, that an attack of spirillum fever in a monkey confers protection from a second inoculation, but that this immunity is lost after the lapse of a short period of time, viz., about 4 weeks. Further, by repeated injections of spirillum blood in increasing amounts at short intervals of time, the duration of this period of immunity can be markedly lengthened. I have immunized several monkeys in this way. One example will serve to illustrate the method employed and the results obtained:Medical Offcers of the Army of India. 85 primary attack, and his blood contained plentiful spirilla; no result: 3 c. c. of the same material gave rise to an attack of spirillum fever in a monkey, which 2½ months previously had suffered from an attack of this fever, but which had not received any inoculations of spirillum material in the interval. Several monkeys have been treated in this way and with the same result. The longest period in any instance which was allowed to elapse between the last two inoculations was 2½ months. Further experiments may show that an immunity of much longer duration than this could be conferred on monkeys similarly treated.

The experiment now recorded was made on the eighth day after this inoculation. The spirillum blood was got from a monkey on the first day of fever; its temperature was 105.6° F. and its blood was full of spirilla. The serum and spirillum blood were mixed in three different proportions:Medical Officers of the Army of India. 89 The only proportion in which the serum and blood were mixed was that of equal parts. The following result was obtained:90 Scientific Memoirs by Experiment 4.

This blood contained spirilla in enormous numbers. No attack resulted from this injection. A fresh control monkey also received 2 C. c. of the same material. As a result it suffered from an ordinary attack of spirillum fever of three days' duration. Experiment 3. Medical Officers of the Army of India. 93 The plasma was injected subcutaneously in several places. No attack of spirillum fever followed. The control monkey, S-25, had its spleen removed also on February 1st. It received 2 c. c. of the same spirillum blood as monkey S-26. As a result it suffered from a typical attack of spirillum fever. This attack lasted for three days and was terminated by crisis in the ordinary way, the spirilla at the same time disappearing completely from the blood. It may be noted in passing that this recovery of a spleenless monkey does not confirm the observations of Soudakewitch 9. This observer produced the disease in two monkeys from which the spleen had been previously removed. In these cases the spirilla did not disappear from the blood at the usual time of crisis, but rather increased in number and a fatal result followed. Further I have notes of another monkey which was inoculated with spirillum material 5 days after its spleen had been removed. This animal received 1 c.c. of the spirillum blood by intra-peritoneal injection and 4 c. c. under the skin. As a result it suffered from a characteristic attack of fever with spirilla in the blood. This attack lasted for 3 days and terminated by crisis, the spirilla at the same time disappearing from the blood. The conclusions which appear to be justified from the data put on record above can conveniently be stated as follows:94 Scientific Memoirs by of the immunity which I have shown is enjoyed by the monkey as a result of an attack of spirillum fever, and it would also appear certain that the spleen has not the important function which has been assigned to it by some observers in the destruction of the spirillum organism. The mental picture of the process which these observations suggest to me may be briefly stated as follows: As a result of spirillum infection in the monkey, anti-bacterial substances make their appearance in the blood and lymph from an early date in the course of the attack: these substances increase rapidly in quantity and ultimately at the time of the crisis are present in the blood in such amount as to be able to destroy the vitality of the spirilla circulating there. The spirilla partially, if not completely, devitalised in conformity with the general rule which obtains when either bacteria or inert particulate material, such as carmine particles, is introduced into the blood stream, become deposited in the spleen and other internal organs. There, such as have not been completely dissolved by the bacteriolytic substances, are taken up and digested by the polynuclear white cells. It has been shown by Metchnikoff10 and other observers that for a period of some hours after the spirilla have com- pletely disappeared from the blood, they are still alive in the spleen and in a condition able to give rise to infection in a fresh animal. Experiments, to be detailed later, point to the fact that the anti-bacterial substances immediately after the crisis are present in greater amount in the blood serum than in the splenic serum. Our theory, therefore, is not upset by those observations. For a short time after the crisis, the anti-bacterial substances present in the blood may possibly undergo an increase in quantity. The experiments of Bardach11point to this. Such an increase would be in conformity with the well-known fact that a considerable increase of the specific agglutinins takes place in some cases of typhoid fever after the defervescence of the fever. It is, how- ever, only reasonable to suppose that these anti-bacterial substances must under- go, before the Organism can be re-infected, such a diminution in amount as to permit of the spirilla again living and cultivating themselves in the blood and lymph of the body. That they do not completely disappear is evident from the fact that they can be demonstrated in vitro practically up to the time when re-in- fection is possible. Now this is a question which at first sight would appear capable of being resolved by a quantitative determination of the anti-bacterial substances contained in the blood serum or lymph at varying intervals after the crisis. A moment's consideration, however, will show that results comparable among themselves cannot be obtained in the case of any one monkey. For the bactericidal power of any serum or lymph may a priori be expected to vary
Medical Officers of the Army of India. 95 according as the micro-organisms, which are exposed to it, are in great or small amount and according as they are virulent or attenuated bacteria. It is evident, however, that inasmuch as a totally different specimen of spirillum blood would have to be used for each observation, neither the number of spirilla nor their virulence could be controlled in any series of experiments having as their object an estimation, from day to day, of the amount of the anti-bacterial substances present in the blood of a monkey after the crisis. This consideration quite explains the somewhat anomalous results obtained by Bardach and others in their attempts to make such an estimation. We may now pass on to consider whether the theory enunciated above can by analogy be brought forward as an explanation of the phenomena which are characteristic of an attack of spirillum fever in the human subject. The crisis which is seen in man is strictly analogous to that which occurs in the monkey and subject, therefore, to the same explanation. The researches of Gabritchewksy12and Bardach13have demontstrated in vitro the presence of anti- spirillar substances in the blood serum of patients during the whole of the apyrexial period, viz., at a time when the spirilla are absent from the general blood stream. Although there is no direct proof, it must be assumed that during this apyrexial period the spirilla continue to live and multiply in the spleen and other internal organs.14The relapse, analogous to the second artificial infection of the monkey, would, therefore, take place only after such time when the anti-bacterial power of the blood had diminished to such an extent as to allow the spirilla to again enter and cultivate themselves in that medium. Now inasmuch as the spirilla continue to live and multiply during the apyrexia in the organism long after the appearance of these bactericidal substances in the blood, the consideration that these substances may be inoperative in vivo is brought before us. Such a con- clusion would only be valid if it could be shown that the spirilla are really living and cultivating themselves in a medium which contains an amount of bactericidal substances equal to the quantity present in the circulating blood. For the com- plete resolution of this question it is obvious that a quantitative and comparative estimation of the amount of bactericidal substances present in the blood, and in the organs in which the spirilla still live during the apyrexial period, would be essential. The conditions necessary for such an investigation are seldom met with and unfortunately in my experience no such opportunity has occurred. It has been mentioned above that in the case of the monkey, spirilla are present in the spleen for a short time after the crisis in a condition capable of giving rise to infection in a new monkey, and that at this time they have com- pletely disappeared from the blood. It is apparent, therefore, that some light might Z
96 Scientific Memoirs by be thrown on the question under consideration by a comparative estimation of the anti-bacterial substances contained in the splenic serum and in the blood serum of monkeys immediately after the crisis. It is the result of such an in- vestigation which I have now to present, and which I shall preface by giving a short account of the technique employed. The spleen, removed immediately after the crisis, was pounded in a mortar with an equal weight of normal saline solution. This was then thrown on a filter and a clear filtrate obtained. At the same time as the spleen was removed, blood was collected from the ear into a capsule. This capsule was set aside for an hour or two till a clear serum had exuded from the clot. The serum was then diluted with equal parts of normal salt solution. By this means a blood serum of prac- tically the same dilution as the splenic serum was obtained. For inasmuch as the solid splenic substance amounts to only one-sixth of the total weight of the spleen, the slight inaccuracy, which has been admitted into the experiments by using for comparison blood serum of only one fold dilution, need not be taken into account. Both sera thus diluted were then mixed with equal parts of spirillum blood taken from a monkey and prevented from clotting by the addition of citrate of soda.15A hanging drop preparation of each of these mixtures was put up. The remainder was stored in capillary tubes. All preparations were kept at the temperature of the laboratory, viz .Medical Officers of the Army of India. 97 23 hours after mixing: some spirilla still very motile, others have a sluggish movement, while some are quite motionless.

The result of such an investigation has been put on record by Professor Wright and myself 16. We made comparative estimations of the agglutinins in the serum of the heart's blood and in the serum of the spleen, or of Peyer's patches, in four cases dead of typhoid fever at different periods of the disease: further we made com- parative estimations of the agglutinins in the serum of the heart's blood and in the serum of the spleen in two cases dead of Malta fever. These observations clearly established that the spleen in the case of typhoid and Malta fevers is much poorer in agglutinating substances than the circulating blood. As a result of these observations and other considerations stated in the publication referred to above, we enunciated a theory as an explanation of the relapses which are so common both in typhoid and in Malta fever. This theory may be briefly stated as follows:102 Scientific Memoirs by Medical Officers of the Army of India. loss of the anti-bacterial substances by elimination. It is only by this latter process that the blood can be thus altered before re-infection in the case of the monkey. The relapse is always of shorter duration and less severe than the primary attack. This is no doubt due to the fact that the organism at the beginning of the relapse has already in its possession a considerable amount of anti-bacterial substances and is therefore in a much better position to do battle with the spirilla than it was at the commencement of the primary infection. The same explana- tion may be brought forward to account for the shortness and mildness of the second and third relapses when these occur. Notes and references.

EXPLANATION OF PLATE I. A.On the Anatomy of the roots of Ph104 Scientific Memoirs by The great majority of the roots show the peculiar appearance of being divid- ed into zones or segments. Typically the whole root is marked off into zones of approximately equal depth, the zones being alternately white and brown. Thus a root measuring 3" long was divided off into fourteen practically equal segments or zones. The segmented appearance is brought about really by the development of the white zones, the brown zones being the ordinary epiblemal tissues, not encroached upon by the white zones. The white zones have the appearance as if the root had been 'ringed,' and the ring then dusted with oatmeal or flour, according to the coarseness or fine- ness of the appearance. The floury looking deposit is a good deal thicker at the upper part of each white zone than at the lower. The upper edge of a white zone is abrupt and irregular in outline, with torn fragments of epiblemal tissues overhanging it. This lower edge is indefinite, fading away into the brown zone below. In the smaller roots at least, each white zone increases in diameter from below upwards and each brown zone from above downwards, so that at the junc- tion of the upper margin of each white zone with the lower margin of the brown zone above, the root shows a distinct nodal appearance. There are, however, no true nodes present, so it is here preferred to consider the rootPLATE II [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of 75005159.tif] Fig. 1 X 8/1 [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of 75005159.tif] Fig. 2 X 8/1 [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of 75005159.tif] Fig. 3 X 340/1 [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of 75005159.tif] Fig. 4 X 340/1 [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of 75005159.tif] Fig. 5 X 340/1 [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of 75005159.tif] Fig. 6 X 340/1 [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of 75005159.tif] Fig. 7 X 340/1 [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of 75005159.tif] Fig. 8 X 73/1 [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of 75005159.tif] Fig. 9 X 73/1 [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of 75005159.tif] Fig. 10 X 340/1 A.

EXPLANATION OF PLATE II. Fig. I. Transverse section of medium sized root of PhMedical Officers of the Army of India. 105 the centre of the section is the stele, which occupies about a quarter of the whole diameter of the section. The stele is surrounded by a thick cortex, showing a division into four or five distinct regions. The cortex, in the young root at least, is surrounded by the epiblema, which cannot, however, be made out distinctly under this low power. Beneath the epiblema lies the outermost division of the cortex, built up of very small closely packed cells, B of figures 1 and 2 of Plate II. Within this comes a clear ring of cells with unthickened walls, not represented in figures 1 and 2, but seen under a high power in figure 4, taken from another section. Next comes another band of closely packed cells, not so small as those of the outer band. This band106 Scientific Memoirs by Examination of the various regions roughly indicated above in detail under a high power gave the following results:Medical Officers of the Army of India. 107 The inner layers of this ring appear to be developed successively from the outer cells of the clear ring separating the outer hypodermal ring from the inner. The clear ring may be reduced to a single layer of cells separating the two sclerenchymatous rings, or all its cells may undergo secondary thickening, so that the outer and inner hypodermal rings become continuous. In longitudinal section the cells of this clear ring resemble those of the outer hypodermal ring, but with thin walls. The inner hypodermal ring in cross section is built up of about six layers of large polygonal cells, with secondary thickening and many narrow pits. The radial diameter of the cells varies roughly from 26uto 44u. Their length varies from 44uto 300u. They are oblong in longitudinal section, with rounded ends. The appearance of the cells is shown in figures 4 and 6 of Plate II. Within this inner sclerenchymatous ring is the greater part of the cortex, marked D in Plate II. The cells of this region are more or less circular, or some- what polygonal, in outline in transverse section, with numerous intercellular spaces and unthickened walls. Their diameter varies from about 23uto 64u measured in the transverse section. Many of the cells present the peculiar appearance of having each a smaller cell inside, the real cell and the apparently contained cell, looking like two con- centric circles, as seen in figure 7 of Plate II. A longitudinal section explains the appearance. In longitudinal section the cells are markedly polygonal. At every intercellular angle the combined wall forming the partition between contiguous cells, splits, so as to enclose a small circular or oval or triangular space. This space is very distinctly marked off in sections mounted in glycerine by the clear cut, swollen, and hyaline appearance of its bounding walls, in con- trast to the dark granular looking walls common to the cells where they remain in contact. The appearance is seen well in figure 10 of Plate II. This peculiar appearance as of small hyaline cells interpolated at each intercellular angle is not nearly so well marked in sections mounted in Canada Balsam. In transverse section it frequently happens that one of those clearly bounded circular spaces is in practically the same focus as the section of the cell at the basal or apical angle of which it is situated, so that the intercellular space appears as a circular cell inside the large cell. The same appearance is seen also in longitudinal section, though not so markedly. Scattered amongst the ordinary cortical cells are somewhat larger ones, which show dense contents, sometimes faintly granular, at other times resinous or gummy looking in appearance. cc
108 Scientific Memoirs by The contents contract slightly in material treated with alcohol, and very readily take up the safranin stain, in marked contrast to the surrounding cells, which prefer the Hoffmann's Blue. None of the reagents at the writer's disposal had any effect on the cell contents. Probably these large cells are secretory in func- tion. Their appearance and relative frequency to the ordinary cortical cells is seen in figure 9 of Plate II. The longitudinal diameter of an ordinary cortical cell is about 46u. Towards the periphery the cortical cells become smaller in transverse section and more oblong in longitudinal section, and the intercellular spaces disappear. They gradually merge into the inner cells of the inner hypodermal ring. Central- ly the cortical cells form a distinct band, E of figures 1 and 2 of Plates II and III, immediately surrounding the endodermis. The cells of this band are oval in transverse section, and radially compressed. Their radial diameter varies from about 8uto about 16u, their tangential diameter from about 15uto about 45u. In longitudinal section they are oblong, with a diameter varying from about 38uto about 82u. There are no intercellular spaces and the cell walls are rather thick and coarsely granular in appearance. The large spindle shaped intercellular spaces appear to be formed by the chizogenous separation of one or more radial rows of cells, which cells at first lie loose, and ultimately break down and disappear. The strands of sclerenchymatous tissue, scattered thickly through the cortex are polygonal, or more or less circular, in transverse section, and are built up of about thirty to forty cells at any one level. Longitudinally they run in straight parallel columns. The individual cells are spindle shaped, about 6 mm. long and 5.5ubroad. The endodermis surrounding the stele is a single layer of cells, which at first are thin-walled, and square in transverse section. Soon, however, secondary thick- enings are laid down on their central and radial walls, reducing the lumen very considerably. The secondary thickening is not laid down uniformly, but leaves pits, looking like small canals traversing the thickened cell wall. The appearance of the endodermis when secondary thickening has occurred is seen in figure I of Plate III. Passage cells with unthickened walls are left here and there in the ring, either solitary or three or four in a row. The average radial diameter of the cells is 15u, the tangential 18uand the longitudinal 60u. Internal to the endodermis is the pericycle, P of figures 1 and 2 of Plate III, consisting of a single layer of thin-walled cells rather larger than the cells of the endodermis, with which they alternate, and oval or polygonal in outline.

Medical Officers of the Army of India. 109. Their radial transverse diameter varies from 8uto about 16u, their tangential from 12uto about 23u. Longitudinally they are polygonal, with a longitudinal diameter varying from about 32uto about 66u. The xylem bundles are separated from the pericycle by a single layer of thin-walled cells, which are smaller than those of the pericycle. A xylem bundle is built up of about six reticulated or practically scalariform vessels, polygonal in transverse section and of diameter varying from about 5uto about 24u. The largest vessel is almost always nearest the centre of the root. The surrounding unlignified cells are polygonal in transverse section, varying a good deal in size, elongated longitudinally with pointed ends. To the-inner side of each xylem bundle, and separated from it by one or two layers of unlignified cells is a large thin-walled reticulated duct, almost circular in transverse section. Its elements measure about.8 mm. in length. Alternating with the xylem bundles are the phloem bundles, made up of the usual elements. Each bundle shows from four to six somewhat large empty cells, the sieve tubes cut across, situated towards the centre of the root. Between those and the pericycle and also surrounding them to some extent are the small companion cells, with densely stained contents. The length of the elements making up a sieve tube varies from 75uto about 200u. Within the ring of xylem and phloem bundles, between it and the pith, is a broad band of sclerenchymatous cells, about eight to twelve layers in breadth. It is separated by one or two layers of thin walled cells from the large reticu- lated ducts situated to the inner side of the xylem bundles. It usually shows rays projecting outwards between those large ducts. Sometimes there is present a second more or less complete circle of large thin walled ducts, situated nearer the centre of the stem than those opposite the xylem bundles. The ducts of this inner circle may get completely surrounded by the rays sent out from the sclerenchymatous band, and they then appear to be imbedded in the scleren- chymatous band. This inner circle may be reduced to only one or two ducts. Each duct is immediately surrounded by a layer of thin walled cells. The cells of this sclerenchymatous band are polygonal in transverse section, with a diameter varying from about 8uto about 32u. The secondary thickening is not uniform, for many pits are left. In longitudinal section the cells are spindle shaped, with an average longitudinal diameter of.7 mm. The pith, which is surrounded by this sclerenchymatous band, is composed of cells similar to those of the cortex, having the same appearance in transverse
110 Scientific Memoirs by section, and in longitudinal section differing only in the greater length of the cells. The transverse diameter varies from 20" to about 67", the longitudinal from 36" to 92". The intercellular spaces show the same peculiar appearance as in the cortex. There are also present the same kind of large secretory (?) cells, with dark staining contents, as in the cortex. Sections taken through a white zone of a root show, so far as the greater part of the cortex and the stele are concerned, the same structure as sections through a brown zone. There is, however, a considerable difference in the outer cortical region, which may best be explained by tracing the course of development that leads to the appearance of the white zones. In the region of the root, where a white zone is about to develop, the inner sclerenchymatous hypodermal ring is absent. The outer cells of the cortex in the region, corresponding to the inner margin of the inner hypodermal ring, form several layers of actively dividing cells. These cells are thin walled, oval or circular, and continuous internally with the ordinary cortical cells. Externally these actively dividing layers of cells produce a crescentic mass of cells, the inner three or four layers of which are made up of cells also in a state of sub- division and of the same shape as the cells of the underlying originating layers, only with thicker and coarser walls. As the cells of the mass are pushed further out, they develop large intercellular spaces and assume very irregular shapes, as shown in figure 7 of Plate III. Under a high power they are seen to be finely muriculate. The whole mass reminds one of the packing cells of a lenticel. The crescentic mass of packing cells is at first bounded externally by the outer hypodermal ring, and at each horn of the crescent by the ends of the in- complete inner hypodermal ring. Ultimately the pressure of the mass of rapidly formed cells increases to such an extent that the outer hypodermal ring, and overlying epiblema if present, are ruptured, and the mass of cells appears on the surface as a white patch. The above description applies to the appearance of a transverse section taken just a little above the upper margin of a white zone, and represented in figure 4 of Plate III. A transverse section taken just below the upper margin of a white zone, shows the layers of actively dividing cortical cells encircling the entire circum- ference of the root and giving off packing cells all round, which externally are separating from each other and falling away. There is no trace of the inner hypodermal ring.
Medical Officers of the Army of India. 111 A transverse section taken still lower down a white zone, shows the inner hypodermal ring now present and encircling the whole circumference of the root, while the layer giving rise to the packing cells is now external to the inner hypodermal ring. A transverse section further down still, shows the packing cells beginning to disappear, and mixed up with cells of the outer hypodermal ring, resembling the outermost cells of that ring in a brown zone. The section in fact, except for the few packing cells still present, is just like a section through a brown zone. A longitudinal section made through the junction of a white zone with the brown zone above it, and extending downwards to the brown zone below, explains how the different appearances of transverse sections at various levels of the white zone are brought about, and also how the white zone fades away inferiorly in an indefinite manner, in contrast to the abrupt way in which it ends above. In a longitudinal section, as in figure 5 of Plate III, the inner sclerenchymatous hypoder- mal ring C, traced from above downwards, ceases abruptly just above the upper margin of the white zone and begins again a little below the upper margin of the white zone. The gap thus left between the upper and lower ends of the broken inner hypodermal ring is occupied by the actively dividing outer cortical layers giving rise to the packing cells, which latter have their focus of formation in this gap, overhung by the torn outer hypodermal ring. The actively dividing cortical layers traced downwards pass external to the lower continuation of the inner hypodermal ring, and become continuous ultimately with the clear ring of cells, separating the inner from the outer hypodermal ring. The dense inner layers of the packing cells become continuous with the inner cells of the outer hypodermal ring. At the upper end of the white zone the actively dividing cortical layers give rise to packing cells only, but as the layers are traced downwards, the thickness of the mass of packing cells diminishes, they gradually become less irregular in shape, more like the outer cells of the outer hypodermal ring with which they are mixed up, and ultimately are entirely replaced by the latter in the lower zone below. Owing to the looseness of the texture of the packing cells, an extraordinary amount of air is entangled in their interstices, and it is this which gives the white appearance of the zone to the naked eye. This air is exceedingly difficult to get rid of, especially from the inner layers of the packing cells, and it is the presence of this air in the inner layers of the packing cells which causes the appearance of the black band seen in figures 4 and 5 of Plate III. The development of the white zones appears to the writer to lead to the con- clusion that they are in reality specialised lenticels of unusually large size and DD

The abundance of air entangled amongst the packing cells makes it a diffi- cult matter for water to gain direct access to the tissues through the white zones. This is probably a provision against the fact that in its natural habitat the palm is likely to have its roots periodically covered with water. The root cap shows a division into an inner and an outer portion, but nothing peculiarly worthy of note was noticed. The appearance of the root cap and the growing point is represented in figure 9 of Plate III under a low magnification. The branch roots originate from the pericycle and show nothing worthy of remark. As regards cell contents, no starch was detected anywhere. The outer hypo- dermal ring cells often showed dark granular contents, giving no reaction with any of the reagents at the writer's disposal. A few hexagonal tabular crystals were seen in the cortex. Along the strands of sclerenchyma scattered through the cortex, rows of very small sphaeraphides were seen, each apparently enclosed in a little intercellular space between the strand and the surrounding cortical cells.
On some Practical Methods of Sanitation in India, with special reference to Cantonments. BY ERNEST ROBERTS, D.P.H. (Carob.) MAJOR, I.M.S. The object of this paper, for the opinions expressed in which (save for the numerous references to authorities quoted) the writer is alone responsible, is to attempt a review of practical methods of sanitation now generally in vogue in India, with special reference to those communities over which we may be said to exercise more or less complete control, and for which pro tanto our responsibility is greatest; and to examine the adequacy and scientific sanction of these methods. In the second place, the biological and chemical forces which are called into play in the new departure in the methods of sewage " purification " will be reviewed, in order to elucidate the essential principles that must be observed in practice. And, lastly, some practical conclusions and suggestions will be offered. If any apology be thought necessary for inviting the reader to accompany me over this well-beaten track, at a time when over forty years have elapsed since the great teacher and inspirer, Parkes, began his ever-memorable work at Netley, I venture to invite a consideration of the following facts, and to others that will appear in the course of the first part of this paper. Enteric Fever. During the past ten years the ravages of enteric fever among the British troops in this country may be estimated by the following statements:114 Scientific Memoirs by Filth Disease. III.Medical Officers of the Army of India. 115 were 596 cases and 121 deaths from enteric fever alone, while from all the above causes combined there were 1,965 cases (98.2 per mille) and 189 deaths (9.4 per mile). IV.116 Scientific Memoirs by certain of the largest centres of population, let us look at what is generally known as the Indian method of the disposal of that form of refuse from which we have most to fear. Here the absence of an organic water-supply-drainage system, the cheapness of labour and the availability of land have indicated and justified the prevalent method of the surface burial of excreta by what is known as the " trenching system." We have been fortified in our procedure by the designation it has received as " Nature's method " in its simplest and most direct form, and where it is carried out with due regard to all the essential conditions, and where subsequent cultivation is not delayed, we have perhaps the most simple, scientific and adequate means of disposal; but it imposes special difficulties and risks upon the stage of removal. It is equally safe to affirm that this system, as carried out, has failed to solve the most important problem of Indian, sanitation, and it is obvious that where a system of this kind falls short of perfect success, it opens the way to very special dangers in this country. And apart from the possibility of securing perfection in detail, it is often impossible to avail ourselves of this method. In the first place, although the great majority of the population is scattered in small agricultural communities over the enormous area available, yet there are a large and increasing number of towns with a considerable number of inhabitants in each. At the last census there were 28 towns each with a population of from 100,000 to 821,000; 48 towns of from 50,000 to 100,000; 150 towns of from 20,000 to 50,000; 1,407 towns of from 10,000 to 20,000; altogether there were 1,831 communities with a population of 3,000 and upwards, aggregating approximately 27 million souls. There was, in fact, ten years ago, as large an urban population as in Great Britain at the same date. Urban population. To any one acquainted with the structural conditions of Indian towns, it will be obvious that, as regards the first three categories at least, comprising a total of 226 communities, the problem of adequate removal and disposal by trenching presents great difficulties, and in most cases they are insuperable. Indeed it may be said that where adequate knowledge and control are available, the difficulties are such as to render the system impracticable; where, as in the case of the village communities which include go per cent. of the population, " trenching " might be carried out to the best advantage, the essential knowledge and control are too often wanting. Here for the most part individual freedom of action prevails; the excreta are deposited upon the surface of the soil, or where an advance is attempted upon this primitive absence of method, the collected night- soil is conveyed just beyond the inhabited site and deposited en masse in more or less deep excavations in the soil, which is a rough and ready modification of the cess-pit system, but lacking its admittedly inadequate safeguards.
117 Medical Officers of the Army of India. As a very general rule then, it is only in those limited communities which are constantly under strict sanitary control by medical officers, viz., in jails, asylums and Regiments and on some Government farms, that scientific methods of earth disposal are at all adequately pursued. Can it be affirmed that there is nothing to be desired, that we have attained the finality of a perfect method of disposal so far as these especially favoured institutions are concerned? The "Trenching" system. There is unfortunately much cogent evidence, direct and indirect, in contraven- tion of such a comfortable assumption, and as witness to the former category we need only cite the Annual Reports of the Sanitary Commissioner with the Govern- ment of India (see especially Section II, and tables V, XXX and XLIV in the appen- dix) and the criticisms and orders which issue from headquarters from time to time, the latest of which emanated from the Quarter Master General's office as recently, as September 1899 and June 1900.*It will be admitted that while the present system in cantonments and jails is open to criticism in its simplest details, there are abundant sources of risk at nearly every stage of the procedure for removal and disposal, if it be granted that human excreta contain the elements of, or pro- vide the favouring conditions for, certain disease causes. It is scarcely necessary to follow the course of events from the latrine to the trenching-ground, to point out how each and all the links in the chain may prove defective, with the conse- quent retention of dangerous organic filth in the immediate environment; any one whose business it is to supervise the arrangements can fill in the details. Radical defects in removal. The quarter Master General remarks (September 1899* ) as regards "the frequent inspection, the disinfection of latrines and conservancy plant generally, that this is a matter which should receive closer attention, and one which, His Excel- lency regrets to note, is to a considerable degree lost sight of in British corps," but indeed, nothing short of the most constant and sedulous supervision throughout the whole process will avail to obviate the risks, while we have to depend on the careless and ignorant native sweeper. It is not possible for the medical officer to be ubiquitous, and for the most part his supervision and action is remedial rather than preventive. Everything depends on conscientious attention to details: e.g ., are the regulations as to the use of dry earth in the pans, and its frequent removal from, and renewal on, the latrine floor, properly effected? Is the number of sweepers always adequate, and, as a consequence, is the removal of the uncovered, or partially covered, excreta immediately effected, or is it done at what are euphemistically called "stated intervals"? Special directions are given as to the glazing of the pans and as to their cleansing; but the glaze is often bad and the pans crack, and in their cleansing and in the cleansing of the * No. 3851-B. of 22nd September 1899 and Nos. 2311-2314-B. of 29th June 1900, to Lieutenant Generals Commanding; the latter will be referred to subsequently.

118 Scientific Memoirs by larger receptacles, water, and not dry earth, is frequently used, and this dangerous office is done just behind the latrines, with spilling and pollution of the soil. Next, there is the transfer of the excreta from receptacles to the carts; and what is to be said of the carts? Are they ever properly cleansed; if so, how ? On their way to the trenching-ground they spill filth and stink abominably, and, as they cannot be properly cleansed, they continue to stink and attract flies on their return. Major Davies, R. A. M. C., the first and the most reliable authority, to whom I am indebted for information on these points, says: "the whole question of cleaning these fouled articles is most difficult."* As regards Native Troops, the regulation plan of a movable latrine is an improvement on the old fixed arrangement; but they are often not moved, and consequently the ground around is fouled and gets no purification from sun-action. When the latrine is moved, it is directed that the site should be cultivated, but this is often not attempted and is in many places impossible, owing to the nature of the soil and the want of water. "For Native Troops, followers, &c., the appliances allowed are quite inadequate, and both soil and air pollution must result." (Major Davies.) Drainage. Water-supplies. The arrangements for the removal and disposal of cook-house and lavatory waste also leave very much to be desired,Medical Officers of the Army of India. 119 conditions of soil and climate. The best of earth-disposal systems can only give satisfactory results under the four conditions of120 Scientific Memoirs by italicised the reference to specific pollution, and we need only-refer to Dr. Horton- Smith's Goulstonian Lectures (1900) for ample evidence of the danger and pre- valence of undetected sources of such pollution, in ambulatory cases and in convalescents both as regards the solid and liquid excreta. Dr. Robertson, the experienced M. O. H. of one of the chief endemic Typhoid areas in England, has stated his deliberate opinion, that of 20,000 cases investigated, about 10 per cent. were due to direct infection (as in nursing); water and milk-borne infection may account for 10 per cent., while 80 per cent have a dust and filth-borne origin with its nidus in the soil. (British Medical Journal of August, 1898.) Again the figures submitted by Dr. Boobyer (M. O. H., Nottingham) as regards the relative incidence of typhoid fever on communities served by privy- middens, by the pail system and by water-closets, have a very definite bearing on the subject of our means of removal and disposal. The incidence over ten years was shown to be relatively as follows:Medical Officers of the Army of India. 121 In the second place we may cite the researches of Dr. Sidney Martin, F.R.S., (which are set forth in the most recent reports of the Medical Officer to the Local Government Board), "on the growth of the Typhoid Bacillus in soil," and which, although still in course, have resulted in the production of evidence that certain soils, and notably cultivated garden soils, do under certain conditions provide a favourable medium for the viability of the germ; he notes also that when the soil, sown with the bacillus, had become so dry as to be reduced to fine powder, the specific living contagium could be recovered therefrom. A series of experiments made under more natural conditions by Dr. Robertson, M.O.H., Sheffield,*has supplied evidence of equal importance as regards the persistence and viability of the typhoid bacillus in ordinary soil. B. Typhi in soil. We may include in this category the forcible evidence adduced by Dr. Waldo in the Milroy lectures of 1900 of the relations between fæcally con- taminated dust and the prevalence of epidemic diarrh122 Scientific Memoirs by Hofmann's re- searches. Subsoil water pollution. it is quite certain that certain negative views based on observations in Europe by Hofmann*(which indeed are very noteworthy) cannot be held to apply to this country so far as Hofmann's conclusions are concerned; of course the physical processes which he so carefully elucidates, are to be found in action in tropical and sub-tropical soils, and on a scale beyond comparison more marked in propor- tion to the precision and dramatic force of the meteorological conditions. It may be confidently said that nowhere to the same extent as in the Indian plains (and the tropical monsoon area) do we obtain the "dry zone" in the soil favourable to the detachment and aërial transport of soil bacteria on the one hand, and the circulatory connexion between the upper and third layers of the soil (in which latter the subsoil water lies) during monsoon conditions, on the other hand. Hofmann's papers must be studied in order to obtain an appreciation of what these physical processes involve, in a country where all refuse finds its way directly to a porous alluvial soil, where the ground-water is subject to large fluctuations and overlarge areas, and rises under the influence of the monsoon to within a foot or two of the surface, and from which drinking-water supplies are largely obtained. Observations on the bacterial flora of our water-supplies at different seasons, on the lines of Dr. Houston's experiments set forth in the Reports of the Medical Officer to the Local Government Board (for 1897-98 and 1898-99) are much to be desired on the part of medical officers of jails and regiments. Médécin- Major Vincent, Pro- -fessor attached to the Val-de-Grace Army Medical School, in a paper read before the Paris International Congress (1900), gives the results of the bacteriological observations he made on the subsoil water of a military camp in Algiers both before the arrival, and again at intervals during the sojourn, of the troops. The result of his work was to show that the number of microbes in the subsoil water rose regularly and progressively in a few weeks from 200 to 14,900 per cc., and from 37o to 38,000 per cc., on two different occasions respectively. "The pollution of the subsoil water was therefore in proportion to the duration of the sojourn of the troops"; and "these researches show that infectious microbes, deposited on the surface of a sandy soil, can penetrate to the subsoil water through a bed of sand fifteen feet in thickness," where the level of the ground-water varies considerably with drought or rain. "The use of this subsoil water brought about epidemics of typhoid fever every year which have almost entirely disappeared since the introduction of a pure Artesian supply." Are our efforts well directed? All these considerations point to the necessity of reconsidering the hygienic value of our present methods of waste removal and disposal, of water-supply and of drainage. Is it possible to study the conditions actually obtaining in our cantonments and their affiliated bazaar communities, as set forth year by year in the reports of medical officers, without coming to the conclusion that a * Archiv für Hygiene, Vols.

What in fact do all the strenuous efforts in regard to enteric fever, summarised annually in Section II of the Report of the Sanitary Commissioner with the Government of India amount to, but.a too frequently futile endeavour to counteract radically defective conditions that are largely of our own making, in the shape of a piecemeal policy of waste removal and disposal, and of water-supply ? And, as a consequence, we have the demand for the " perfect incinerator " that seems to present a problem as difficult to solve as that of perpetual motion; and when we get it, will it not be further evidence of that short-sighted policy that encourages the presence of disease causes and then sets to work to destroy them in one direction only ? It is as if one encouraged incendiarism, and established a costly method of putting out some of the sparks. Again, as a consequence, we have often two alternative water-supplies, and then embark on boiling and " permanganating," with the result that opinion and evidence is as strong against these latter methods as for them, and, indeed, they seem to be only maintained as a counsel of despair. Take the following brief epitome of the opinions of medical officers with reference to the " causes " of enteric fever, as given in the Sanitary Commissioner's (India) Report for 1899, Section II; first, references to excretal pollution:124 Scientific Memoirs by a few reports mention incineration; the perfect incinerator has not yet been found, but experiments are being continued," Medical Officers of the Army of India. 125 sumption. These vegetables were cut up and shaken up in sterilised water and direct microscopic examination revealed the presence of an extraordinary number of animalcules belonging to the various groups of rhizopoda, infusoria, crustacea, arachnids, insecta and worms; some 52 species in all, mostly innocuous, but including Am126 Scientific Memoirs by To a consideration of the practical measures thus indicated, a subsequent part of this paper will be devoted. The whole tendency of the evidence adduced is to incriminate the soil as the chief source of enteric fever and other bowel-complaints, directly or indirectly, through the water and food supplies. A specifically polluted soil is a constant source of danger to the inhabitants; a non-specifically polluted soil is only one degree less dangerous as it provides a favorable medium for the specific virus, and by its action on the individual it lowers the natural resistance to that virus. The problem of removal and disposal involves above all thing an avoidance of the pollution of the soil of the environment, at least so far as this can reasonably be held to enter into direct relations with the community dwelling thereon. It is necessary therefore, as a preliminary to the practical suggestions to be made, to invite attention to the natural forces upon which we depend for the ulti- mate mineralization of all waste organic matter, to the consideration of which the writer was naturally led in the course of a series of experiments on the treatment of the sewage of a large Indian community. II. One of the very first uses to which the first microscope was applied was the discovery by van Leeuwenhoek of minute living forms in the intestinal canals of frogs and birds, and in his own diarrhMedical Officers of the Army of India. 127 to our artificial methods of sewage purification, it may be well to point out briefly that the processes of assimilation and dissimilation in the human body, whether we consider the specific actions of the cellular units and their ferments or those of the normal bacterial flora of the intestinal tract, afford a clear indi- cation of, and analogy to, the action of bacteria in our biological methods outside the body. The elemental food substances which provide us with energy are of precisely similar composition, if in varying proportions, to the waste organic fluids and solids which go to make up "Sewage." The means employed and the object are the same in both cases. In both there is a conversion of poten- tial into kinetic energy, by the splitting up and rendering soluble of the complex molecule (albuminous, carbohydrate or fatty) to permit of final oxidation, and in both the agencies concerned utilize the energy obtained for their vital pur- poses. And in the living body we see as a result the formation of end products, in the gases and water formed and excreted by the chief emunctories, which it is our object to arrive at by our artificial methods; but the human body can only partially effect this dissolution, and there remains a residue of unattacked and intermediate products, which constitute the solids and liquids of sewage and of which the breaking-down is only partially initiated by the putrefactive bacteria of the large intestine.* The natural agents then are present and pass away with these remaining excretory products, and we have simply to provide the former with the necessary conditions for their functions. Here we have the indication of those natural methods, to which Pasteur by his fundamental researches on fermentation supplied the key, and further, definitely formulated the institutes of the modern technical applications of bacteriology of which the "biological" method of the treatment of sewage is not the smallest triumph. It will therefore, in the first place, be no mere academic exercise to briefly summarise our knowledge on these points; we may then deduce the first principles which should guide us in practice, and this will lead to a brief con- sideration of their application to the conditions which obtain, more especially in Indian cantonments and bazaars. All living matter is constantly undergoing decomposition, and hence must assimilate substances that contain all the chemical elements of which it is con- structed. In the complete drama of metabolism we find a series of acts rising by synthesis to the most complex of known organic compounds, the proteids; and conversely, a complementary series of processes of destruction of living substance into its simplest inorganic compounds and elements. This drama is played upon The drama of metabolism. * See Bunge, "Physiological Chemistry," pages 304 128 Scientific Memoirs by Pasteur's work. The rôle of oxy- gen. the stage of every living organism, and although we cannot say of the vegetable cell that it is concerned exclusively with synthetic functions, nor of the animal cell that it maintains its vital energy solely by decomposition, yet we recognize that, broadly, vegetable and animal mutually subserve each other's needs in the rhythmical flow of energy which never varies in its final amount. Inasmuch as the animal cell is unable to complete the resolution of the complex potential compound into its final kinetic terms so as to be available for plant food, we need a third kind of organism, half plant and half animal, to complete the cycle, and whose metabolic relations are not so sharply differentiated as those of the higher organised plants and animals. This link is supplied by the fungi, which obtain their necessary Carbon and Nitrogen from more or less complex chemical compounds, organic (and, for the most part, dead) and inorganic; they thus subserve both plant and animal life, by rendering the food elements available, and by the transmution of dangerous waste products. For this they are fitted by the wide limits within which their external vital conditions can vary, and by their rapid multiplication, for which they use up a large amount of material in a short time, a small portion of which goes to provide for their own growth, while a far larger proportion is decomposed by their fermentative actions and is thus prepared for final oxidation. One of the first steps in our knowledge of their physiology was the discovery by Pasteur that the yeast and mould fungi were, in so far, like the higher plants, that they could assimilate their necessary Nitrogen and Carbon from ammoniacal salts and even from nitrates, and thus these were differentiated from the great class of fission fungi, which in their vital require- ments stand nearer to the animal organism. It was further shown by the same observer that micro-organisms exhibited the most marked differences in their relation to free oxygen which had been supposed to be a sine quâ non for all living beings. One great class requires free oxygen and leads to rapid oxidation of their medium, while another can not only live without the free element, but can only fulfil their proper functions in its absence, and that, given this condition, an extensive but superficial decomposition of the nutrient material takes place, which represents the fundamental dynamic phenomenon of fermentation. It is true that Pasteur's dictum, "fermentation is life without oxygen," has, on account of later knowledge, lost the force and truth of a universal law, and, moreover, we have learnt that the majority of putrefactive organisms belong to the class of facultative anaërobes, and that their vital functions vary in the presence or absence of free oxygen,* much as the products of a smouldering kiln and a blast furnace vary. A microbe that for its own vital advantage would better thrive in free oxygen, will, if * See Duclaux, " Traite de Microbiologie," Tome I.
Medical Officers of the Army of India. 129 deprived thereof, produce a far more extensive, if not so profound, effect upon the substratum from which it derives its vital energy. It is not therefore that we have to depend for an all-important process on a certain limited number of obligatory anaërobes, but that we enlist the special faculty of the vast majority of aërobic organisms by arranging to deprive them of a sufficiency of air for their "external" respiratory needs. The integrity of the complex molecule is infringed by the dislocation of its oxygen, which the aërobe will not be denied, and the combina- tion of the atoms of the resulting products is rendered still more unstable. We see how in the case of the alcoholic fermentation of sugar, the amount of sugar decomposed in the unit of time is inversely proportional to the supply of oxygen;*and Fränkel130 Scientific Memoirs by question. At the same time we recognize that another class of organisms (obligatory aërobes) depend for their fermentative faculty on the presence of more or less oxygen, as in the lactic and acetic fermentations; and further, as has already been noted, we recognise still another distinct class that not only demand free oxygen in abundance, but require for the building up of their albuminous molecule the simpler inorganic salts and compounds which have resulted from previous decompositions. We can therefore no longer define the rôles of these several classes by one simple formula; there are a series of processes, which require separate consideration, and which vary markedly according to the species of the fungus and the sum total of the external conditions supplied. We shall see immediately how these considerations apply in practice. Specific vital ac- tions of different or- ganisms. The understanding at which we have arrived is of the first importance, as upon a due recognition and application of it we depend for our success in all the technical applications of biological processes. The facts of natural selection have abundantly shown that in the struggle for existence, living organ- isms exhibit mutual antagonism. The conditions which favour the mould fungi, if slightly accentuated, are unfavourable to the fission fungi; we know how the acid excreta of cattle present a favourable nidus for moulds to a comparative exclusion of ordinary putrefactive schizomycetes; and among the latter, in a mixed infection, the sum total of the conditions determines the growth of certain kinds and the inhibition or death of others. It is a well-established fact of the laboratory that pathogenic organisms, which have adapted them- selves to certain special conditions of medium, are overgrown and killed out by saprophytes in ordinary media to which the latter have free access. And again there is no question that the conditions favourable to anaërobes are inimical to aërobes, and vice versâ; it would be idle to expect the best results from the synthetically working nitrifying organisms, and from the analytic anaërobes which split up proteids, if both be placed under the same conditions. The organisms which effect "top" and "bottom" fermentation in the same vat are of totally different species and cannot interchange their rôles (Mitscherlich). But even here we must distinguish grades of antagonism; at opposite ends of the scale it is direct and uncompromising; between these points it melts away into "metabiosis," that is to say, different species which are adapted for different purposes, follow one another in ordered sequence, the former preparing the viable conditions for those that come after, until those at each end of the scale are antagonistic or work under mutually exclusive conditions. The more or less specific distribu- tion of all living organisms in time and place is a well known fact, familiar in its grosser aspects, but based on vital laws which may be recognized everywhere. M
Medical Officers of the Army of India. 131 By the recognition of these laws the modern technical applications of bacteriology have secured their greatest triumphs, as in brewing, wine ferment- ation, tanning, the making of butter and cheese, &c., and they have a most important application to scientific methods of sewage "purification." Summing up at this stage, we see, then, that bacteria are able to construct their body-substance out of various kinds of nutrient materials, analytically or synthetically, and at the same time to act with marked effect upon the substratum. But vital differences in these respects are to be noted; some species are better adapted to one method and one set of conditions, which arc foreign to others. In the decomposition of dead organic matter certain species are better fitted to break down the complex compounds present at the start, while others work up the end products to final oxidation, the complete drama being presented in a series of integral acts, in which each species plays a defined rôle. A brief allusion may now be made to the special nature of the vital and chemical actions of bacteria, in virtue of which the whole of the enormous and never-ceasing accumulation of waste organic products is transformed and enabled to re-enter the cycle of life. The biochemical forces in the transformation of waste pro- ducts. For our present purpose, these waste products may be distinguished as nitrogenous (urea, waste proteids and their derivatives), and non-nitrogenous (chiefly carbohydrates). As regards the former we know that the nitrogen con- tained in the urea and in the solid excrement is not in a form available for plant food. It is not until this nitrogen has been removed from the organic molecule by the process of putrefaction, and has been united to a mineral base by the subsequent process of nitrification, that it can be disposed of by the plant. Putre- faction is a purely biochemical process, which only takes place under the fundamental conditions of all vital action132 Scientific Memoirs by which serve to render this soluble and so available for the supply of food and energy to the cells. Thus sugars are "inverted" and albumen peptonized by the enzymes, and these soluble products are thus laid open to attack by the cells. Nitrogenous bodies then are split up by putrefaction into a large number of simpler compounds, some of which are non-nitrogenous; first we get albumoses and peptones, due to the action of enzymes just as in the case of digestion (pepsin), and these later undergo a further splitting up into certain aromatic compounds and amido-bodies; further, fatty and aromatic acids (non-nitrogenous) are produced, and finally we get the inorganic end pro- ducts, such as free nitrogen and hydrogen, ammonia, carbonic acid, methane and sulphuretted hydrogen. All the former complex bodies are broken down to these last, the original substratum being radically transformedMedical Officers of the Army of India. 133 metabiotic nature, i.e ., carried out in definite sequence. What we have practically gained so far is the solution of a crude and complex mass, and we have reduced the formidable molecule to a condition of instability whereby it is open to attack on all sides by oxygen134 Scientific Memoirs by appropriate chemical conditions for their specific actions, until at last we obtain in the effluent, a mob of organisms by which the final stage of purification is effected. Oxygen alone is now required, and this is often present in the effluent to the amount of 40 per cent. of the maximum possible, and more is provided by the salts in solution for ultimate mineralization. Lastly, we may say, that although all sub- stances are not capable of fermentationMedical Officers of the Army of India. 135 ditions; they set up the putrefactive fermentation proper, but they require the pre- paratory action of the aërobes. If, however, the fluid is exposed to the air, the aërobes develop continuously at the surface and form a scum which at times falls to the bottom in masses, but is constantly regenerated. The scum prevents the access of oxygen to the liquid, and thus provides the necessary anaërobic conditions for the putrefactive organisms below. The complex fermentative pro- ducts, thus formed, serve as nutriment to the aërobes at the surface and the latter break them up into the simplest compounds, water, carbon dioxide and ammonia. [Sims Woodhead has since confirmed this, by the demonstration of anaërobes in the lower part and body of an open tank, and of liquefying aerobes on the surface, to the rôle of which in the second stage we have referred.] In these words we have a prophetic statement of the advantages to be obtained from the treatment of sewage in an open "Septic tank," or in an open upward "cultivation tank" (Scott-Moncrieff) to which we shall subsequently refer. But it is obvious that, in practice, in dealing with large bodies of sewage, we cannot rely on this process alone for the sufficiently rapid mineralization of the waste products; we should not only need apparatus of a size impossible to obtain, but we should incur all the disadvantages and dangers of the old cess-pool system, with loss of the immense manurial value of the organic matter. Nevertheless it is clear that in fermentation without oxygen we have so far gained enormous advantages in the breaking down and solution of the solid waste, which is now rendered far more readily susceptible of final oxidation. Coming now to the practical application of the principles which govern the biochemical forces in action, we see that we must provide the following stages for their distinct rôles:136 Scientific Memoirs by The effluent flows from the top of the first upward tank on to the surface of the downward filter, which is allowed to fill, and without resting, is then discharged and carried by pipe or conduit, toMedical Officers of the Army of India. 137 these filters rapidly choke and become useless, because the larger proportion of solids is not in solution.* Comparison of biological methods with earth disposal. We shall not detain the reader with a statement of the advantages and dis- advantages which accrue from the employment of the " biological " method so- called, as compared with the present system of direct earth-disposal. The first part of this paper provides a sufficient indictment of the latter, and in considering its merits and demerits one must give full weight to the most important question of " removal," and of the removal and disposal of the considerable quantities of waste water of various kinds that by the present arrangements are a standing menace to the community. Briefly, it may be said that labour is multiplied, and that supervision is inadequate, however conscientious, and we have no right to expect the best results from this hide-and-seek policy, which opens the way to dangerous risks at every stage. Its chief justification lies in the return of plant food to the soil, but if cultivation is neglected or impossible, its rationa.e is lost, and if cultivation be carried out, it is secured at the risk of infringing other cardinal principles of disposal, viz. , that it should be sure, rapid, complete, innoc- uous and economical. Do we, in fact, fulfil the conditions formulated in the words of Sir J. Simon that we have quoted, and will anyone deny that they are indispensable, or aver that they are impossible ? There is full warrant in the evidence adduced 'that the " system " is no system, and that it has demonstrably failed in the essential points we look to it to fulfil. Even in its best form, as regards disposal only, viz. , in the Allahabad system of surface trenches, there are special dangers in the varying extremes of the Indian climate; it is employed in only a few places, and is not everywhere possible of application. Cultivation is delayed, or is not possible at a time when the danger is greatest, and there is the difficulty about the necessary water for irrigation of the crops. " The careful and intelligent cultivation of the land is the point on which the system breaks down in practice.138 Scientific Memoirs by Objections to bio- logical methods. The objections that have been raised in this country against the more artificial biological methods, and which at present appear to stand in the way of their adoption areMedical Officers of the Army of India. 139 arrangements? The fact forms the most damning indictment of these arrange- ments, and I would be content to rest the case for the prosecution on this alone. Given a damp polluted soil upon which contaminated urine is, at any rate, con- stantly deposited, and add to this the faulty latrine system, we have abundant foci of infection provided before we get to the trenching-ground. Let us, however, look at what we actually know as regards the biological methods of which an adequate system of removal must form an integral part. It is proved to demonstration that where a proper water closet and drainage system is in use, there enteric fever is enormously reduced, if not altogether abolished.*We may, how- ever, admit that while the chemical qualities of a sewage effluent can be controlled by biological methods to any extent and to any desired stand- ard, yet the evidence, so far available, appears to point to the fact that in some forms which these methods take, there is no large detention or destruc- tion of the characteristic flora of sewage. Organisms, not indeed ranked as pathogenic, if highly suspect140 Scientific Memoirs by factive processes are initiated under anaërobic conditions, should, find the condi- tions more propitious. But B. coli is a sanitary bugbear in virtue of its associa- tions and it has yet*to be proved that it can per se produce enteric fever, by a progressive property of infectiveness; at any rate it is abundantly present as a normal guest in every human intestine. What we can say amounts to this, that the sojourn of fastidious parasites in an anaërobic tank exposes them to such unfavourable conditions, mechanical, (from sedimentation and a course of upward and downward filtration), chemical and biological, that the chances of ultimate survival in the final effluent are exceedingly poor and doubtful. The fate of pathogenic organisms in the dead animal body under anaërobic conditions affords striking testimony in favour of this view.141 Medical Officers of the Army of India. The results of other observers as to the viability of B. typhi in sterilized and unsterilized sewage, respectively, bear out this opinion. Professor Boyce, in a preliminary report to the Royal Commission, remarks that "filtra- tion" has a marked effect on keeping back the B. enteriditis sporogenes (which is responsible, in Klein's opinion, for acute summer diarrh142 Scientific Memoirs by of obtaining adequate supervision, absolutely essential for carrying out trenching, is largely minimised, and with a proper integral system of removal is almost entire- ly obviated, while the risks to health, to some extent incumbent on all methods, are reduced to a minimum. In larger communities installations can be estab- lished at suitable points, and so save the cost of large schemes for the devolution, of all the sewage to a common outfall; smaller communities need not wait for the large comprehensive schemes required by towns in or near which they are situated. As regards the final disposal of the effluent, we have doubtless something yet to learn, if it be desired to discharge it into a stream. Our own opinion has been. stated, that no means of disposal can compare with land irrigation both for safety, and for the return we desire in the shape of vegetables and other crops which, will go far to recoup the expenses of the first cost of the necessary apparatus. Still, where a foul nullah or water-course is the only resource, we may rest assured that, so far as the chemical effect of the effluent is concerned, a great purification of the stream is secured, from the biological and chemical forces, which characterize the effluent (see Manchester experiments, independently confirmed by those made by the writer at Simla, in 1899-1900). III. We come now to a brief discussion of the practical application of the prin- ciples which have been set forth in the preceding pages, and we must premise that our object is "the perfect adaptation of drainage, water-supply and scavenage to the purpose of carrying away, inoffensively, all refuse materials of life from the person, the house and the environment, so soon as possible after their formation, and with as near an approach as possible to one continuous current of removal,"* and with this, their speedy, safe, complete and economical disposal. It is clearly impossible to indicate here in exact detail the precise measures ne- cessary to achieve these objects, which must be grasped in their organic unity; the special conditions of each community and locality must necessarily be studied and the measures must be adapted thereto. What follows must therefore take the form of general suggestion, which will not be found difficult of application, pro- vided that the necessity for a radical reform of our present methods, and the prin- ciples which should guide us to that end are accepted as an undeniable obligation by those responsible for the lives and well-being of our troops. The subject on its practical side will be dealt with, briefly, under the follow- ing heads: (I) removal of excreta and, polluted waste water; (2) disposal; (3) water-supplies; (4) general remarks. *Sir J.

Removal.144 Scientific Memoirs by parallelogram, as regards the most economical laying of the latrine drain pipes and their linking up into a larger connecting drain which will conduct to the installa- tion; but given a sufficient natural fall in the ground this is a matter of detail presenting little or no difficulty. Take the case of the ordinary company-barrack, to each of which is attached a latrine and a lavatory. The present pan arrangements of the former should be dismantled; the present flooring and the soil around the latrine should be removed and renewed and the whole site and structure be thoroughly disinfected. It should then be fitted with automatic flush W. Cs. of which good and reliable patterns will be cited; these should be raised to a sufficient height above the old floor level to provide an adequate fall for the soil pipe which should run from end to end of the latrine, receiving the discharges of the series of W. Cs., and itself discharge into the connecting drain. If, for example, the closets are raised some 4 feet above ground-level, we at once secure a gradient of 1 in 30 for the first 40 yards of the system, that is, until the con- necting drain is reached, which may therefore take-off at surface level and still have the whole of. the natural gradient available. Of self-acting flush water closets one of the best, strongest and most reliable is Shank's supplied to the new General Hospital, Calcutta, by Messrs. Norton and Sons. When the seat is released by the user, a 3-gallon flush is discharged from the cistern. Price, Rs. 80 (approximately). An equally good and reliable apparatus is that devised by Mr. Donaldson for use in the Presidency Jail, modified for Europeans' use. The self- acting flush is worked by the seat as in the former pattern and is simple in construction and not likely to get out of order. It could be supplied for about half the cost of the former, viz., about Rs, 40. Drawings can be supplied if desired. A "flush-trench" latrine might be devised in place of W. Cs., but it has several disadvantages; there is splashing from the fall of the excreta, and the trench on its upper edges must get encrusted with the deposit of organic matter, and this will entail subse- quent hand-labour for its removal, and here a factor is introduced which we wish to eliminate. There will also be waste of water beyond requirements, and some necessary exposure of the excreta before removal, even if an automatic tip flush is provided which also involves waste; it lacks many of the advantages of cleanliness and of immediate removal so essential to attain. For the supply of flushing water two sources are available, viz. , that from the lavatory, and, preferably, a separate supply of fresh water, which would only amount to some 300145 Medical Officers of the Army of India. or at proper intervals along its course. If, on the contrary, no extra supply of fresh water could be allotted to the latrine W, Cs., the lavatory waste is at disposal for this purpose, 300146 Scientific Memoirs by 100 to 300 gallons capacity according to the length of sewer to be flushed. All these are points upon which precise action can only be taken after a careful survey of the site, and are given here in the form of a general idea, which may easily be modified according to the particular facilities or difficulties met with. It is believed that, generally speaking, a fall all over, of 1 in 100 Medical Officers of the Army of India. 147 At the very least, hermetically sealed cars with a non-absorbent lining must be provided, and these must be run on well-laid tram-lines to the installation, to prevent spilling. No consideration, however, should be allowed to weigh against the scheme for adequate drainage, whether in the form sketched, or in some modification thereof, which alone attacks the problem at its root. Danger of infective urine .148 Scientific Memoirs by the second, the mehter in charge has simply to open the discharge valve of the former and set the fluid contents free to find its way to the ground set apart for cultivation, upon which it should be distributed as in irrigation. In some cases it may be found preferable to resort to continuous downward filtration in the second stage; that is to say, that the effluent from the first upward bed will be simply discharged on to the surface of the downward filter and allowed to pass down and through it in a gentle equable trickle to the outlet where it will at once escape to the channel which conducts it to the irrigation ground. In this case the equable distribution of the fluid over the whole surface of the filter is a point of importance and many devices to secure this are described in the books devoted to the subject; the writer has found a perforated pipe fountain sprinkler, attached to the outlet pipe of the first upward bed, very efficacious. In this case the walls of the filter may be perforated with air-holes to admit oxygen, and the necessity of opening the outlet valve is obviated; the filters will also do more work, but even so, the amount passed through them must be regulated, a simple matter if the preliminary mixing tank, to be alluded to later, be adopted. This, briefly, shows that the rôle of the human agent is reduced to a minimum, and an intelligent mehter after a week's training is quite equal to the task, though, of course, it should be arranged, that the working of the apparatus be supervised by some responsible European, conservancy Sergeant or other.* Plate I. gives in rough outline an idea of the structural details of the apparatus, as arranged to accommodate the sewage of 1,000 men for whom 3 gallons per head of flushing water are provided. The first upward filter bed will hydrolyse the sewage of 1,000 Europeans even if the dilution of the excreta ranges from a minimum of 3 gallons to a maximum of 8 or 10 gallons or more per head, so that no modification will be required in its size when the sewage of one regiment only is to be dealt with. The filters, on the contrary, must be made of sufficient capacity to hold the total quantity of the hydrolysed sewage, and obvi- ously they will (unlike the first upward tank) vary in size according to the amount of dilution of the sewage. In constructing these beds it may be taken that their capacity when full of filtering material is 2-5ths or 1-3rd of that of the empty beds, so that, if the filters are only charged once a day, their total capacity when empty (before putting in the filtering material) must be 2½ to 3 times that of the daily amount of sewage to be treated. The simplest arrangement is to have two large filters, each of a capacity to hold half the total volume of the sewage; but any number of filters may be constructed according to the exigencies of the site, though this slightly increases the demand made on the man in charge in con- nexion with the due devolution of the sewage on to the different filter beds. The *This question of short "contact" or of continuous downward filtration is to be decided by the course of the processes in the first upward tank; a simple after for the che ists' decision. It may confidently be asserted that if hydrolysis be well effected, the latter system of working the filters will be easier and quite effectual.
Medical Officers of the Army of India. 149 whole operation as regards the working of the installation should only occupy three or four hours daily, and as the result of experience the writer can testify that one or two mehters can be relied on to perform their simple functions after due training. With three large model installations going at the same time, no trouble whatever was experienced in getting the necessary manipulation of discharging the filters by mehters who had been carefully instructed at first, even when supervision was at times withdrawn. The filtering material of the first upward bed rests upon a false bottom in the form of a grating (made of old railway rails) which is placed about a foot above the true bottom. On this grating is first arranged a layer of old tins, bottles, and pots, of all shapes and sizes and generally with their open mouths directed upwards; this layer should be 2 feet in depth. Upon this is laid down a layer of coarse clinkers or burnt clay, which for half a foot in depth should be fully the size of a closed fist, and for another half foot, of half this size. Lastly, on top of this, a layer 1 foot deep of somewhat finer clinker, graduating from1"150 Scientific Memoirs by It would require a volume to discuss in detail the many points that might arise in different places in connexion with the subjects of "removal" and "disposal." The barest indications are here afforded, and every scheme must receive separate attention at the hands of Medical Officers and Engineers qualified for the work. While it is far from the writer's intention to suggest that all problems have been solved, the principles and the practical indications they afford are plain. The course is clear; the construction of an installation and its working is simplicity itself; the knowledge of chemistry and bacteriology which is essential for the control of the work should be available in every cantonment. It would, however, be well to entrust the work of the first trial installations, at any rate, to selected officers, of whom there are several serving in India fully competent to undertake it. Although the foregoing remarks have a special reference to cantonments for European troops, the case for improving the conditions of the removal and disposal of the excreta of native troops, is little less urgent, where Europeans and natives are cantoned together. Difficulties there are in the way of a perfect scheme which one need scarcely anticipate in the case of European troops, and especially in the supply of the necessary water for dilution and carriage. But at the same time the whole problem is simplified, if we abandon the system of removal by drainage, which alone necessitates a fairly large supply of water as the motive power. If natives can be compelled to walk (as they now do to the trench- ing grounds) to the site of an installation, two or more being provided at suit- able points to divide up the distance to be traversed, it would appear from Mr. Silk's Calcutta experiments that a dilution of the excreta with one gallon in excess of the ablution water in customary use, or even half a gallon per head with ablution-water, would be perfectly adequately transformed in an apparatus, the first upward bed or septic tank of which was sufficiently large to secure the retention of each day's sewage for some 6 to 8 days, and this is only providing structurally for a daily quantity of excreta with a dilution per head of 6 to 8 gallons. Here we should escape the drainage difficulties with its flushing requirements, and the men would deposit their excreta in the preliminary mixing tank before mentioned, or in a flush latrine attached thereto, and water to the extent of one gallon per head could be added in the latrine or in the mixing tank before discharge into the upward bed or septic tank. This would entirely meet the water difficulty, and involve no more expense in construction, as although the first upward bed or septic tank would have to be slightly larger, to ensure a due sojourn therein for thorough hydrolysis, it would be more than compensated by the decrease in the size of the subsequent downward filtration area, which would only need to accommodate, a body of sewage made up of from 1¼ to 1½ gallons per head.
Medical Officers of the Army of India. 151 For example, we have seen that for a sewage composed of units of 5 oz. solids (European's) with a dilution of 3 gallons, aggregating with urine about 3,250 gal- lons a day, we must provide an upward filtration bed of a capacity of 6,000 gallons to allow space for the filtering material and to ensure at least one day's sojourn in the tank; we have also to provide a filtering capacity (2nd stage) for 3,250 gallons of effluent daily152 Scientific Memoirs by great. It more nearly reproduces the natural conditions under which polluted water is purified, and with a highly concentrated sewage the results are better in the first and also in the subsequent stages.*It is true that if a certain body of sewage is to be passed through a septic tank and an upward filter bed in one day, the latter must be nearly twice as large as the former (on account of the space occupied by the coarse filtering material), but it is equally true that a quantity of concentrated sewage that can be sufficiently hydrolysed in the upward filter bed would require at least two days' sojourn in a septic tank, i.e., the septic tank would require to be double (or more) the capacity of the daily flow of sewage, so that there is I believe an advantage in point of cost of con- struction in the case of the upward filter bed. In the excellent septic tank installation (by Mr. Silk) in connexion with the Presidency Jail, Calcutta, the tank itself has a capacity of 720 cubic feet, or equal to about 4,600 gallons of fluid; into this tank was passed daily the excreta of 220 persons, that of each diluted with 3 gallons of flushing water. This may be taken to equal at most 750 gallons of sewage, so that it would appear that the sewage was allowed a little over 6 days to pass through the tank before it reached the filters. On the plan I propose and which is estimated on the plan of the apparatus carefully tested in the Simla experiments, the upward filter bed which takes the place of the septic tank will only be of a size to allow of the whole body of the sewage of a regiment to pass through in one day; it is obvious that there will be a great gain in the lessened cost of construction, though it is certain that in the Calcutta tank a very much larger body of sewage could be treated with the good results attained under the present arrangements. It may be taken as a practical rule that the strength (concentration) of the sewage determines the size of the hydrolytic portion of the apparatus. With a weak English sewage with high dilution, the tank must be of a capacity to hold one day's flow; where dilution is lower and the sewage proportionately more concentrated, the tank must be of a capacity to allow of a longer sojourn of the sewage therein in order to obtain the due solution and transmutation of the excess solids in suspension: and it is precisely in the demonstrated facts of the superior hydrolytic power of the upward filtration bed that we can afford to provide less unit accommodation in this form of apparatus, when we have to deal with highly concentrated sewage. The one objection that may be raised is the smell that is alleged to arise from an open bed; let this be put to the practical test. The writer can aver from experience that while there might be some "nuisance" from this cause in a crowded site, yet effluvia are only perceptible if one stands over the upward tank, and that this "nuisance" disappears at a distance of a few yards. The apparatus, as proposed, would be from three to five hundred yards from the nearest barrack on the site, and it might be fenced in to prevent a near approach. The water seal on top of the tank prevents the issue of anything but innocuous gases, and even this could be obviated by a top layer of charcoal or fine soil on a wire screen. But the "effluvium nuisance" is imaginative as proved by ample experience in the working of many apparatus attached to country houses and insti- tutions in England. We permit our regimental lines to be dotted over with latrines and filth-carts in close proximity to the barracks, and there is absolutely no valid reason against placing a biological installation at a far greater distance from the inhabited site on this account. I have good grounds for the belief that the upward filtration bed will be *See Kenwood and Butler, Congress of the Sanitary Institute, Birmingham, 1898.
Medical Officers of the Army of India. 153 found far more generally useful and less expensive; at the same time, it may be advisable in certain places (and each case must be considered on its merits) to use the closed septic tank. But one word of caution: we must not fail to give the first stage (of hydrolysis) fair scope, whether we use the closed septic tank as the upward filter bed. There are temp- tations to reduce the size of these, and the thickness of the filtering medium in the latter, with the avowed object of what is called "macerating" (in the sense of breaking up the solids into a sort of purée), which must be resisted, if we are to escape disaster, by minimising the process of hydrolysis (fermentation) and so confusing the subsequent processes, for which due preparation in the first stage is essential. An eminent Sanitary Engineer from England recently gave a specification for an upward filtration bed, allowing only one cubic yard of filtering material for the excreta of nearly 200 natives ("1,000 gallons," composed of the excreta of each person diluted with 5 gallons of water). This, I am convinced, will never do, and was based on the idea that the sewage of the town in question was of a similar strength to that of London, whereas it was 12 to 15 times stronger. Nothing is so dangerous as a rule-of-thumb method in matters involving vital processes. Lastly, should it be desired to make a comparative trial on a small scale of both forms of apparatus, the writer will be glad to exhibit a rough sketch plan of a simple device by which different strengths of sewage can be treated, by which the flow into the septic tank can be graduated and the level of the fluid in the tank kept constant154 Scientific Memoirs by the surroundings and the natural flow of the ground water, and after adequate protection in their course through the soil, they should be provided with pump- tubes and hermetically sealed by masonry covers; the tube should be conducted through the lining below the parapet to some distance from the well mouth, where it will join the pump, so that no pumping is done over the well mouth. The ground around the well should be laid out in grass and the whole area fenced-off to obviate all access by man or beast. A force-pump should be used to raise the water to a proper covered receptacle at a height sufficient to give a fall to the barrack or hospital, where it should be accessible by means of brass taps on the verandah. The chief points to be observed are the choice of the well in unpolluted ground; the protection of the well both as regards its lining and its cover, which latter must be dust and water proof; the reservation of the area around, and the provision of the pump outside the reservation; the distribution by pipes to the barracks, hospital, etc. We have not dealt fairly with our wells in India; we cannot expect pure water from a high and fluctuating ground water, which washes a polluted soil and which is often tapped in ground below the level of a neighbouring native village or bazaar. Beyond this, we find a good well often fails to yield a sufficient quantity in the dry months, and is condemned as useless, when deeper boring would tap the permanent supply, and not the fluctuating "drainage" level. Systematic bacterioscopic examinations should be carried out at all Station Hospitals on the lines of Dr. Houston's researches already alluded to (Part I), i.e ., along with an examination of the normal or predominant flora of the soil of the drainage area of the well Such observations carried on in a large number of places, differing in their geological and climatological charac- teristics, throughout the seasons and for a sufficient time, would, if supplemented by exact meteorological observations be of immense value. The epidemiology of many diseases would doubtless be elucidated; as it is our knowledge of the seasonal variations of the bacterial flora of soil and water is very defective.*If, however, the precautions we have indicated are maintained, we need have no fear of direct or indirect contamination of the well. Here then, briefly, we may secure the necessary quantity and quality by adequate means of protection of a simple character, and then we have to obviate all unnecessary interference and manipu- lation, by abolishing the various links in the chain of supply, any one of which may fail, where human agency is employed, and so lead to disaster. A sketch plan of the arrangements, here proposed, which have proved their efficacy after a long trial in certain rural lowland districts in Scotland, is appended (see Plate II). I am indebted for the idea and for details as to the results based on * See Report of Sansary Commissioner India) for 1899. Sect. VI, Cholera.

The provi- sions under the Code as to by-laws are too lax and permissive, and this particu- larly with regard to the control of trades, etc., from which most of the danger to the troops is considered to arise; and "the multiplication of sanitary officers, will and can do nothing if the law allows any loophole for escaping conformity with sanitary requirements." In the important matter of conserving a pure-water supply we find it enacted that "no person shall without permission place any latrine, cesspool, urinal or drain, or use for the deposit of offensive matter or rubbish, any place within fifty feet of any source of public water-supply." Any "person" may, it would seem, put his latrine at a distance of fifty feet or nearer "with permission." Again the provisions laid down (sections 73 and 76) as regards latrines, are not calculated to arouse the enthusiasm of the most lukewarm sanitary reformer. Major Firth concludes by saying that " we can only hope for very gradual, improvements, as a result of a judicious combination of cajoling and menace on the part of officials" * "but success in this direction is purely that of the individual and not of the administration." It must be affirmed that neither the specific provisions of the Code, nor the authority to which their execution is en- trusted (with the large amount of judicial and office work this individual has to perform) provide a basis for sanguine anticipation; menace and cajolery are tardy agents to depend on. By the time the ground has been covered at infinite, trou- ble, those who were first cajoled into some reform have relapsed, and so the work goes on da capo. For ignorant people it must be made as easy to do well as to, do ill, and nothing will avail but radical reforms in all the practical measures by which a community can live cleanly and righteously in a sanitary sense. A large proportion of enteric fever infections are contracted during journeys by rail and on route-marching. I affirm from a wealth of experi- ence as a Civil Surgeon, a Provincial Sanitary Officer and a traveller, that the lack of sanitary arrangements at our railway stations and dâk bungalows is a crying scandal. If we cannot touch those sloughs of despond known as hotels, it is certainly, incumbent on the authorities to put the former under strict sanitary discipline. A little interest in the matter bestowed by the local sanitary author- ity would go far to improve matters and save many valuable lives. It can be done and has been done (i.e. , the supervision has been exercised) in a few cases known to the writer, but unless some general action be taken, the task is hope- less over the length and breadth of the land. A code of rules should be drawn up setting forth the elemental sanitary conditions that should be observed, and legalizing supervision and penalties for non-observance of the rules.
Medical Officers of the Army of India. 157 This leads us to the question of the sanitation of troops on the march and in camp. The annals of route-marching in India, involving frequently the use of the same camping site by successive regiments at short intervals, are rich in records of epidemics. In these camps we have every source of pollution of the soil, by badly arranged and badly conserved latrines, by want of care in trench- ing, by accumulation of waste liquids and decaying organic matter. If we look at the medical history of the campaign in South Africa, all this and its results is brought home to us in the terrible figures of mortality and sickness from (chiefly) bowel diseases. If we wish for peace we must prepare for war, and to be ready for war we must prepare in time of peace. The subject is too vast for discus- sion at the conclusion of an ephemeral paper, but one thing is evident. We must expect more from our medical officers than valour in the front line and surgical skill in the field and base hospitals; each regimental unit must have its sanitary preventive patrol or vedette, which should be mounted, and to this end some of the more intelligent men must be trained in peace. Half of this sanitary guard should precede the regiment on the march, and half should follow after taking all measures'to conserve and disinfect the camp. The Medical Service should have an independent transport entirely at its disposal. The whole subject is beset by difficulties when forced marches in a campaign have to be undertaken, but that is no reason why they should be shirked, and this matter is one of the most pressing in the whole question of military reform. The Russians in 1877 made a determined and successful effort in this direction, by the formation of a sanitary corps; but it must be insisted that adequate organization and training can only profitably be instituted during peace, and that officers and men should co-operate to this end. It would lead to good results, slow but sure, if simple, "plain talks," with the men accompanied by simple demonstrations, were made part of the duty of officers. But beyond this, systematic instruction of selected non-commissioned officers. and men should certainly be instituted. If this is held to be necessary in the subjects of agriculture and dairy-farming, the case is far stronger for a new departure on similar lines in the matter of training in the essentials of practical hygiene. Sanitary reform can only be accomplished by the establishment of a subordinate staff competent to maintain a high standard in the details of the Work. Let liberal inducements be offered in the way of staff allowances, etc., and then secure the services of competent men of high character by the test of examination after careful instruction, and no more promising investment of public funds could possibly be made. While generally aiming at the removal of those conditions in the environ- ment upon which disease causes depend for their propagation and spread, something more may be done in the destruction of these pathogenic agents when QQ

Are the excreta of patients suffering from enteric fever and bowel diseases generally, in all cases, properly dealt with as containing all the elements for fresh infections, if they get access to susceptible individuals ? One great difficulty is the frequent absence of a perfectly simple and efficient incinerator for all contaminated excreta. There are legion on the market, and most of them are grievous failures. I venture to draw attention to one that, after daily tests extending over several years, has uni- formly left nothing to be desired. A glance at Fig, I, Plate II, and the accompany- ing description will make its modus operandi clear and will show that the princi- ples on which it is constructed are sound and scientific. As regards its practi- cal efficiency and simplicity, experience based on its systematic use in civil hospi- tals in different parts of India, has demonstrated that it completely solves the incinerator question for infective stools in hospitals. With regard to other pre- cautionary measures, notably as regards infective urine, see Horton Smith's Goulstonian Lectures, "Lancet," March and April, 1900. The adequate sterilization of clothing and bedding is equally necessary.* The conservancy of the site and surroundings and the adequate supervision of cook-houses are understood to be receiving attention. It is surely unnecessary to detail here all the essential points that require attention, to maintain perfect cleanliness and prevent contamination of the food and drink. No piece-meal safeguards against the risks run at the various stages of storage and prepara- tion will avail, unless the proper structural arrangements are provided in the first place, for light, air and cleanliness within, and for protection from pollution from without. It would appear to be absurd to insist upon this, but that the kitchens of those who fare sumptuously every day, are rarely if ever free from the gravest reproach. Absence of light and air, smoke-begrimed walls, loose absorbent brick floors and walls, dangerous water- receptacles, absence of proper drainage, retention of garbage, are too often the conditions met with. And then as regards the milk-supply, let any one who imagines that each cantonment has its own well-appointed dairy, consult the reports of the special Sanitary Officers of Commands and see how matters stand in this respect. In conclusion I have to express my thanks to two eminent members of the Engineering profession for advice on technical points, but whose names I do not give, as I have no warrant that they would endorse my conclusions, as embodied in the section on "Removal." I am indebted to Mr. Donaldson, President of the Simla Municipality, for the great personal interest he took, and for technical advice he afforded to me, in the construction of the various apparatus used in the Simla experiments, and for his aid in getting the attached plans drawn. * See British Medical Journal, November loth,1900, page 1370.

Explanation of Plate II. A safe form of well devised and used by R. W. D. MacMartin Cameron, M.D., D.SC., Medical Officer of Health for the County Councils of Kirkcudbright and Wig- town. The arrangement and the advantages are equally obvious. The reserved area should be at least 20 yards in diameter, with the well in the centre; but this area may certainly be increased largely, if deemed necessary, to ¼ or even ½ acre. The lead pipe running from well to pump should be filted to the latter by brass screw joining. Fig. I, Plate II. Donaldson's Patent Destructor for Hospitals, for the incineration of infectious dejecta. A is an upright cylinder of sheet iron having a lid B, with inlets I. I. for the air required for the furnace. C.C. is the firebrick lining of the furnace, and upon which is suspended the metal pan D. E is the firegrate; F the ash-pit, which has a door G, for removal. H is one cf a series of corrugations in the periphery of the firebrick lining which form air-ducts through which air and the gases are drawn to pass through the closed ash-pit F. These air-ducts are shown in the plan H.H.H. J is the exit for the products of combustion, which may be prolonged to any height by means of a stove-pipe. K is the stirrer for turning over contents of the pan D. It is pivoted in the pan, so that it can be moved about by the rod L when the lid is closed.
