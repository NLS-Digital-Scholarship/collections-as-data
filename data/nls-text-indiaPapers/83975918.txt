Extract from the Proceedings of the Government of Burma,2 RESOLUTION ON THE REPORT ON THE RANGOON LUNATIC ASYLUM FOR 1898. Health. 4. The number of admissions to hospital and the number of deaths were somewhat higher than in the previous year. The increase in the number of admissions is explained as due to greater care in admitting to hospital all cases requiring treatment. The causes of death do not call for remark. The bad health of lunatics at the time of admission is again commented on. Causes and types of insanity. 5. The Lieutenant-Governor would be glad if the Superintendent would deal more fully in future reports with the figures contained in Statements VI and VII. Any conclu- sions which he has arrived at from observation of the inmates of the Asylum would be of value. The number of cases in which the cause of insanity is shown as un- known continues to be large ; no less than 20 criminal lunatics admitted during the year belong to this class. As the Inspector-General remarks, the antecedents of criminal lunatics are usually ascertainable, and Magistrates should endeavour to furnish as accurate information as possible. Industries. 6. No change took place in the employment of the inmates. The Super- intendent will no doubt consider the Inspector-Gener- al's remarks on the subject of the extra-mural employment of lunatics who are fit for the work. The Asylum garden also affords a healthy form of employment, and efforts should be made to increase the outturn of flowers and vegetables. Attention is invited to the remarks on this matter in last year's Resolution. The average number of inmates employed on manufactures fell from 120 to 107. Profits are shown to have increased from Rs. 8,200 to Rs. 9,940, but the calculations require explanation. It is not clear how the value of plant and machinery has risen during the past two years instead of depreciating as might be expected. The milk business continued to be carried on with success. Cost of maintenance. 7. The average cost of dieting has decreased by Rs. 16 per head and the total average cost of maintenance was Rs. 122 against Rs. 128 last year. The figures call for no special comment. The reduction in the cost of diet is partly explained by the increased use of dal in place of beef in the dietary. Amusements. 8. Attention continues to be paid to the provision of amusements for the inmates. The asylum pwès have become a regular institution and are considerably attended by out- siders. 9. The accounts of the Lunatic Asylum for the period September 1897 to June 1898 were audited during the year under report. Mention of the result of the audit has again been omitted from the report. A deficiency of Rs. 100 was brought to light. The enquiry held in this matter and the result of investigations into somewhat serious defalcations in the stock of paddy revealed considerable laxity on the part of former Superintendents in the management of the accounts. Orders have been issued with a view to prevent the recurrence of similar irre- gularities. By order of the Lieutenant-Governor, J. B. WINGATE, Offg. Secy. to the Govt. of Burma.
From Colonel D. SINCLAIR, M.B., C.M., I.M.S., C.S.I., Inspector-General of Jails with Civil Medical Administration, Burma, to the Secretary to the Government of Burma,( 2 ) died a few days after admission and 13 within less than six months. The physical condition of civil lunatics on admission is generally much worse than that of criminal lunatics. In the letter forwarding the Asylum Report for 1884, I ask " Can the " preponderance of deaths on the civil side be a measure of the " extent to which insanity is feigned on the criminal ?" The preceding remarks dispose, to a large extent at all events, of the suggestion contained in this question. (g) Owing to overcrowding in the Rangoon Jail byre, five cows and eight calves were transferred free of charge to the Asylum. (h) The expenditure on superintendence (column 9, Statement IX) is shown as Rs. 2,766-2-0 ; it should be (Rs. 250 X 12) Rs. 3,000, but Major Davis has yet to draw pay for the period from 1st to 29th October. There has been during the year under review a reduction in diet (column 10) of Rs. 4,880-3-10 compared with the preceding year. This is due partly to the non-delivery of paddy explained in this office letter No. 6535A.-2T.REPORT ON THE RANGOON LUNATIC ASYLUM For the year 1898. Introductory Remarks.2 REPORT ON THE RANGOON LUNATIC ASYLUM FOR THE YEAR 1898. 3. Water-supply is satisfactory. The quality is shown in the following table:REPORT ON THE RANGOON LUNATIC ASYLUM FOR THE YEAR 1898. 3 The number of these convalescents is usually about 24 per cent. of the Asylum population. The cost of the extra diet thus supplied was as under:4 REPORT ON THE RANGOON LUNATIC ASYLUM FOR THE YEAR 1898. The net results of the Asylum milk business for the past three years are con- trasted in the following statement:REPORT ON THE RANGOON LUNATIC ASYLUM FOR THE YEAR 1898. 5 14. Statements Nos. I and II give particulars as to the admissions, dis- charges, &c. On the 1st January 1898 the total population numbered 342 ; dur- ing the year there were 88 admissions, 44 discharges, and 41 deaths, leaving on the 31st December 1898 a total of 345. Of the 88 admissions, 32 were criminal and 56 civil lunatics. Out of the former, one was a lunatic who had previously been confined under section 466 of the Criminal Procedure Code and after trial was re- admitted under section 471, Criminal Procedure Code. Of the 9 shown as dis- charged otherwise, 3 criminal lunatics escaped, 4 civil lunatics were transferred to the Madras Lunatic Asylum, 1 civil lunatic was transferred from the Civil to the Criminal register, and 1 criminal confined under section 31, Prisoners Act V of 1871, whose sentence had expired, was transferred to the Civil register. 15. Statement No. II shows the criminal population. The number of cri- minal lunatics has increased during the year, the total on the 31st December having been 173 as compared with 164 on the last day of the previous year. The daily average strength has also risen from 157.09 to 163.67. The general behavi- our of the criminals has been on the whole good, though occasional assaults have occurred. On the 19th of May 1898 lunatic Nga Po Sein committed a violent assault on another lunatic, No. 57, Nga Maung, by hitting him on the head with a piece of wood, from the effects of which he subsequently died. Nga Po Sein was at the time classed as a civil lunatic, his sentence of life imprisonment having been remitted by the Lieutenant-Governor of Burma on the 22nd June 1897. He was tried under section 325, Indian Penal Code, and being found incapable of making his defence, was ordered to be confined in the Asylum under section 466, Criminal Procedure Code. 16. The following statement shows the entire population divided into two classes for the past ten years :6 REPORT ON THE RANGOON LUNATIC ASYLUM FOR THE YEAR 1898. 18. The following statement gives the particulars required by the foot-note to Statement II:REPORT ON THE RANGOON LUNATIC ASYLUM FOR THE YEAR 1898. 7 The total number of deaths was 41 (not including one under observation), giving a percentage to daily average strength of 12, or somewhat greater than in the preceding two years. The chief causes of death were dysentery (6), tuber- cle (4), debility (6), mania (7) and diarrhAPPENDICES.

Extract from the Proceedings of the Government of Burma,2 RESOLUTION ON THE REPORT ON THE RANGOON LUNATIC ASYLUM FOR THE YEAR 1899. Health. 4. The number of admissions to hospital was 20 less than in the previousyear and the percentage of deaths to the daily average strength sank from 12 in 1898 to 8 in 1899. The general health of the inmates appears to have been good. The Lieutenant- Governor has read with satisfaction of the continued success which has attended the efforts to provide occupation and amusement for the lunatics. It is, however, to be regretted that no suitable extramural employment has yet been found for them. The increase in the number of admissions under the head of mania is at- tributed by the Superintendent to a stricter classification of diseases. Causes and types of insanity. 5. The Superintendent has made some interesting remarks upon the types of insanity met with in the Asylum, the commonest being mania and melancholia. It is, however, to be regretted that information concerning the causes of insanity is still scanty. In 201 cases out of the total population of the Asylum during the year the cause is shown as "known," while in 261 cases it is returned as " unknown." Out of 117 ad- missions during the year the cause of insanity was only ascertained in 57 cases. There has, however, been an improvement in the extent of information available regarding the criminal lunatics, most of the cases shown as unknown being civil lunatics. Industries. 6. There has been a falling off in the profits from manufactures compared with 1898, but the figures for the latter year repre- sented too high a valuation of the plant in stock, which has now been written down by 15 per cent. The value of the manufac- tured goods shown in Statement XI as having been sold or left in stock in 1899 was Rs. 12,787-11-8, while in 1898 the value was Rs. 13,765-4-1. These figures, however, include the value of the milk and vegetables consumed by the inmates of the Asylum. The profit for 1899 amounted to Rs. 7,784-10-4. The net pro- fit on the dairy shows a decrease from Rs. 2,572 to Rs. 1,755, which is explained by the Superintendent as being due to the failure of a contractor to supply milk for sale to the outside public. Cost of maintenance. 7. The cost of dieting per head was only Rs. 45-6-9 as compared with Rs. 55-8-4 in the previous year, while the total cost per head decreased from Rs. 122-4-9 to Rs. 106-15-7. The total cost of dieting has fallen from Rs. 19,099 in 1898 to Rs. 16,351 in 1899. In view of the fact that the population of the Asylum was uniformly higher dur- ing the latter year, some explanation of these figures should have been given. The total expenditure for the year shows a satisfactory decrease. Accounts. 8. The accounts of the Asylum were audited during the year, but the auditor's note had not been disposed of at the time of writing the report. The explanation for the delay is unsatisfactory. The Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals should satisfy himself that the audit-note is being properly attended to and that any irregularities point- ed out by the auditor are being rectified. By order of the Lieutenant-Governor of Burma, R. E. V. ARBUTHNOT, Offg. Secy. to the Govt. of Burma.
From Colonel C. C. LITTLE, M.D., I.M.S., Inspector-General of Jails with Civil Medical Administration Burma, to the Secretary to the Government of Burma,( 2 ) furnish the largest number of admissions. In 36 cases the occupation was not ascertained. 8.

The causes of death were( 4 ) attributable to the Asylum taking over its own productions to a greater extent, and to there being less demand for labour to clean compounds in the neighbour- hood of the Asylum. The receipts on sales of flowers is nearly double those for 1898 and vegetables have brought in Rs. 16-14-10 more than in 1898. A decrease has been effected under all heads of expenditure except under establishment proper, superintendence, and English medicines and stores. 13.

Lunatics who, on account of their health, are classed as convalescents, have received extras in addition to the ordinary Asylum diet.

She was recaptured near Sagaing and re-admit- ted into the Asylum on the 5th October. Two keepers of the female enclosure were fined and one, a new hand, warned. This lunatic was a prisoner under section 436, Indian Penal Code, and confined under section 471, Criminal Procedure Code. (4) No. 9, Nga Tha Kaing, criminal lunatic, escaped from the Asylum on the morning of the 18th December at about 8 A.M. His method of escape could not be discovered. The man is still at large. He was a prisoner under sections 324 and 326, Indian Penal Code, and confined under section 466 of the Criminal Procedure Code. This lunatic had been 18 years in the Asylum and had always been quiet and harmless, though of poor physique. The keeper from whose charge he escaped has been suspended pend- ing recapture. 13. Statements Nos. I and II6 REPORT ON THE RANGOON LUNATIC ASYLUM FOR THE YEAR 1899. number of criminal lunatics are convicted and sent to jail without the fact of their insanity being brought to light. The large increase of civil lunatics admitted (91 in 1898 as compared with 56 in the previous year) cannot be ascribed to an in- crease of insanity in the province, but is due to the fact that as years go on and peace and order prevail lunatics who of old would have been neglected and left to themselves, are now forwarded to the Asylum for treatment. The number of admissions of civil lunatics must by no means be taken as an index of the mental health of the Burmese people. Large numbers of foreigners are constantly arriving at the large ports for work in the rice trade. Many of these from sickness (especially syphilis), drink, and the use of drugs become stranded in Burma, far from home and friends, and often these circumstances cause them to lose the few wits they may have originally possessed. They are then brought to the Asylum as " wandering lunatics, " generally in a half-starved, deplorable condi- tion. 16.

The cook was to blame for leaving the bone in the soup and steps were taken to prevent such an accident recurring.

(11) Nga Talôk Gyi was admitted with a contused wound of the under lip caused by his biting his lip during an epileptic fit. The injury was slight. (12) Nga Shwe Aung committed a violent assault on one of the Asylum warders, sud- denly attacking him with an iron hoe and inflicting severe injuries. He was seized and disarmed by other attendants and cured lunatics. In the scuffle he was thrown down and disarmed and it was afterwards discovered that his patella was fractured. How the in- jury was exactly inflicted could not be found out, but it was the result of indirect violence. He made a good recovery.

The latter officer only handed it to me on the 6th March 1900, having kept it to himself in the interval. For this and other grave irregularities I have recommended his dismissal from Government service, and the matter is still under reference. Owing to the above circumstances it is impossible to say that the ir- regularities pointed out by the Audit Officer have all been rectified. Most of the outstanding bills have been collected, and the alterations in the stock books of materials for manufactures are being made. Paragraph 19 of the audit note gives directions as to the proper method of dealing with the paddy and rice accounts. These instructions are now followed. A detailed reply to the auditor's queries is being prepared. 24. Statement No. X, showing the Sanctioned Establishment, &c.APPENDICES.

INDIANOTE ON THE RANGOON LUNATIC ASYLUM DURING THE YEAR 1903. Population. Statement No. I. 1. The population of the Rangoon Lunatic Asylum on the 31st December 1902 was 415 (males 366, females 49). During the twelve months under review the admissions numbered 129, the discharges 65, and the deaths 37, leaving 442 on the register at the close of the year. Accommoda- tion. The increase of 27 in the population has been confined to the male side. 2. The estimated accommodation of the Asylum is for 416 (males 374, emales 42) so that there has been more or less overcrowding during the year. Statement No I. The question of providing increased accommodation has been under the con- sideration of the Local Government for some time, but there was difficulty in ac- quiring a suitable site in Rangoon, and the question has been raised whether it would be advisable to locate the asylum in some more central position where land is cheap and where it would be more equally accessible from all parts of the province. The Public Works Department have been asked to furnish plans on the block system, to accommodate 500 patients. Superintend ent. 3. Sanction has been received during the year to the appointment of a Com- missioned Medical Officer as a whole-time Superintendent. Works. 4. A few structural improvements of a minor nature were carried out during the year on the plea of urgency, but many necessary works have been held in abeyance pending the construction of a new asylum. Recoveries. Statement No. I. 5. The percentage of recoveries on the daily average number resident in the asylum during the year was 8.20, namely, 7.89 amongst the males and 10.82 amongst the females, while the percentage of cures to admissions was 27.13 or 27.52 amongst the males and 25.00 amongst the females. Deaths Statement No. I. 6. There were 37 deaths in the asylum as compared with 44 in the previous year. They were all due to natural causes ; no death occurred from misadventure. The death rate per cent. on the daily average strength was 8.67 as compared with 10.57 in the preceding year. Health. Statement No. I. 7. The health of the asylum was on the whole good during the year. No epidemics prevailed and the average daily sick numbered 22.60 against 33.20 in the previous year. The number of admissions to hospital was 144 (130 males and 14 females) as against 188 in 1902. Criminals. Statement No. II. 8. The number of criminal lunatics remaining on the 31st December 1902 was 209 (195 males and 14 females) and 217 remained on the last day of the year under report. Class. Statement No. III. 9. The admissions to the asylum during the year according to class is shown below:2 NOTES ON THE RANGOON LUNATIC ASYLUM DURING THE YEAR 1903. Types & Causes of Insanity. Statement Nos. VI and VII. 11. Mania as a type of insanity furnished nearly 91 per cent. of the admissions during the year. Cost of Maintenance 12. The total up-keep of the asylum aggregated to Rs. 77,810-8-5 or Rs. 182 per head of average strength as against Rs. 197 in 1902. Statement No. VIII. The expenditure incurred on the maintenance of the institution, exclusive of book debits, amounted to Rs. 45,106-3-1 or Rs. 2,247-3-2 less than in the previous year. This apparent reduction in cost is chiefly due to a reduced expenditure on paddy owing to a large balance in hand from the previous year, which reduced the charge on diet during the year under report from Rs. 22,476-7-0 to Rs. 18,883-9-9. Statement No. X. The expenditure on raw materials was less by Rs. 312-11-4. The debits on account of manufacture amounted to Rs. 5,221-11-6 and the credits to Rs. 18,605-7-6 or a profit of Rs. 13,383-12-0 compared with Rs. 11,502-10-10 in 1902, which is a satisfactory feature in the management of the asylum. Audit Notes. 13. The accounts were audited by the Accountant-General's Department during the year. No mistakes, discrepancies, or omissions, were brought to notice, exception alone being taken to certain outstanding bills at date of audit, all of which have since been adjusted. Labour. 14. About 78 per cent. of the patients are engaged on some form of labour as enumerated in last year's report. Four new looms were added during the year, making a total of fifteen looms in use. As the work of these machines is quickly learned they prove useful by affording an interesting and easily acquired occupa- tion, which not only tends to the mental improvement of the insane but also assists in the economical working of the institution. The value of the cloth produced by the looms was Rs. 1,122 yielding a net profit of Rs. 492-5-0 as against Rs. 431-9-6 in the preceeding year. From garden produce a sum of Rs. 399-13-3 was realised. On extra-mural labour the earnings amounted to Rs. 37-9-0. Dairy. 15. Dairy operations were extended during the year by the purchase of 10 more cows and five calves at a cost of Rs. 1,246. Sixteen calves were born during the year. Of these 9 were sold and 3 died. The herd now consists of 26 cows, 22 calves and one bull. The profits of the dairy during the year amounted to Rs. 1,456-15-7. The sale proceeds of milk realized Rs. 4,412-11-6 as against Rs. 3,063-12-9 in 1902. Casualties. 16. Fourteen serious but non-fatal casualties, occurred during the year. Eleven were homicidal, two suicidal, and one accidental. Having regard to the unruly and turbulent character of many insane patients, casualties of this nature must unfortunately be regarded to some extent as unavoidable. Staff. Statement No. IX. 17. The staff remained the same as reported upon last year. The question of revising the establishment has been deferred by the Committee of Visitors until a whole-time Superintendent has taken charge. The Deputy Superintendent, Mr. Phillip, is again very favourably reported on. There can be no question of this officer's practical ability and of the zeal which he brings to bear in the discharge of his duties. C. C.

In view of the unruly and irresponsible character of many of the inmates, it is probable that acts of violence in the asylum cannot be altogether avoided. The number of injuries inflicted by lunatics in 1905 was, however, considerably larger than usual. The Lieutenant-Governor hopes that the increase of staff which has been provided will lead to a diminution in this respect in future. His Honour will be glad to receive a special report from the Inspector- General on the subject of ensuring a closer degree of supervision over the inmates of the asylum, which is dealt with in paragraph 15 of the report. 4. The affairs of the asylum have been efficiently administered by Major Bell, and every attention has, it seems, been paid to the well-being of the inmates.
