The scheme for improving the Ajmer conservancy system also awaits orders of the Government of India. 20. The following are the chief questions in sanitation. which are now claiming the attention of the Ajmer Municipal Committee, but the loss of revenue, the result of the plague epidemic, has crippled the financial resources of the Municipality and its ability to effect reforms:VACCINATION IN RAJPUTANA. 5 VACCINATION. STATEMENT I. General Operations in Ajmer-Merwara. 35. The total number of persons vaccinated in Ajmer-Merwara including Nasirabad fell from 12,801 in 1908-09 to 11,960 in the year under report. There was also a decline in the number of successful primary operations, average number of persons vaccinated by each vaccinator and the average number of persons successfully vacci- nated per 1,000 of population which were 11,533,797 and 24.34 against 12,182,853 and 26.13 respectively in the preceding year. The total number of re-vaccinations in 1909-10 was 85 against 304 in 1908-09 and that of successful re-vaccination 74 and 280 respectively. It will thus be seen that there was a decrease under all heads chiefly due to the severe epidemic of plague in Ajmer City and districts of Ajmer-Merwara. 36. The number of vaccinators was 15, the same as in the previous year, with one Native Superintendent. STATEMENT II. Expenditure on Vaccination. 37. The total expenditure on vaccination during 1909-10 was R3,032-12-4 against R2,974-13 in 1908-09. The in- crease is due to the fact that glycerinated lymph was obtained on payment from the Government Bovine Lymph Depôts. The cost of each successful vaccination in this Division in 1909-10 was 50 pies against 46 pies in 1908-09. 38. The Civil Surgeon, Ajmer, inspected 333 children against 394 in 1908- 09, all of whom were found successfully vaccinated, and the Superintendent of Vaccination at Nasirabad examined 421 children against 603 in the previous year. 39. The Native Superintendent inspected 260 villages and 6,018 vaccina- tions against 6,144 in 1908-09. The percentage of success amongst cases seen by him was 98.87 against 98.75 in the preceding year. General operations in Native States. (Statement I.) 40. The vaccination returns from the Native States show that there was a decrease under all heads except that relating to re-vaccination, which is attributed to the prevalence of plague in most of the States in Rajputana during the season. The total number of primary vaccinations in Native States was 255,990, of which 251,990 were successful against 261,945 primary and 257,998 successful operations in the preceding year. Re-vaccination rose from 311 in 1908-09 to 325 in the year under report, but the percentage of successful re-vaccinations fell from 86.82 to 82.46 in 1909-10. 41. There were 161 vaccinators employed against 162 in the previous year, 2 less in Tonk and 1 less in Jhalawar and one additional vaccinator in Jaipur and Marwar. No vaccinator was employed in Deoli Cantonment during the season as vaccinations were performed entirely by the Hospital Assistant attached to the Agency Hospital, Deoli. 42. Western Rajputana States.6 VACCINATION AND DISPENSARIES IN RAJPUTANA. from arm to arm vaccination, especially as vaccinators are often careless as to the sources they take their vaccine; mothers prefer it, as they often object to the subsequent collection of vaccine from their children and do not know from what caste their children are vaccinated, also the vaccine being pure causes less trouble to the children. 45. The Native Superintendent of these States was sent to Belgaum for special instruction, a plan which might be adopted in other States with advantage. STATEMENT II. 46. The total expenditure on vaccination during: 1909-10 was R29,070-0-6 against R28,946-12-7 in 1908-09, an increase of R123-3-11, which is probably due to the increased expenditure on contingencies. The average cost of each successful vaccination in different States varied from 11 pies in Sirohi to 90 pies in Jaisalmer. The high cost of vaccination in Jaisalmer is attributed to the fact that there is only a small population living in scattered villages in a large area. 47. The following table shows the number of towns and villages inspected and successful vaccinations seen by Agency or Residency Surgeons in Native States:DISPENSARIES IN RAJPUTANA. 7 53. The dispensaries are classified as under:8 PLAGUE IN RAJPUTANA. abnormal, treated in hospitals have been shown separately in statement C. There were 110 normal and 52 abnormal confinements reported from hospitals during the year as compared with 14 and 17, respectively, in 1908. PLAGUE. 66. During the year from 1st April 1909 to 31st March 1910, 30,549 cases of plague and 26,223 deaths were reported and 627 towns and villages were infected in Rajputana including Ajmer-Merwara as compared with 5,619 cases and 4,944 deaths and 200 infected towns and villages in 1908-09. The percentage of total plague deaths to population was 0.99, vide table attached, which shows the comparative severity of epidemics in Rajputana since 1896. 67. Twenty-one thousand nine hundred and twenty-seven inoculations were performed during the year under report at the following places:PLAGUE AND DISPENSARIES IN RAJPUTANA. 9 Native States. 73. There were 21,803 cases of plague and 18,294 deaths reported from Native States of Rajputana during 1909- 10 against 5,448 cases and 4,835 deaths in 1908-09. Of these 167 cases with 131 deaths were imported and 21,636 cases and 18,163 deaths were indigenous. 74. The epidemic affected 10 States and 430 towns and villages, including Deoli Cantonment, against 9 States and 191 towns and villages in the previous year. 75. Jaipur State.10 DISPENSARIES IN RAJPUTANA. STATEMENT H. 89. Shows the income and expenditure of Government dispensaries and hospitals and the expenditure only on those in Native States. 90. The total income of hospitals and dispensaries in Ajmer-Merwara was R19,686, as compared with R18,580 in 1908; this increase of R1,106 is attributed to the fact that arrears of contribution were paid by certain Istim- rardars during the year under report. The value of the invested Capital of the dispensaries in this division remained the same as in 1908. 91. In Ajmer-Merwara the total expenditure rose from R16,994 in 1908 to R17,104 in 1909; this increase is mainly due to increase in Public Works Department charges from R178 to R1,146, this being R598, the cost of the flooring of the upper operation room in the Victoria Hospital, Ajmer, and R537 for construction of a post-mortem room at Todgarh. This raised the debit balance against the Victoria Hospital to R1,591, which was subsequently reduced to R591 by re-appropriation of R1,000 from the Deolia Dispensary cash balance. Native States. 92. The total expenditure on hospitals and dispensaries in Native States of Rajputana rose from R3,56,678 in 1908 to R3,63,854 in 1909, which is shown under heads Establishment, Medicines and Miscellaneous. 93. Of the total cost on hospitals and dispensaries in these States R74,432 were expended in Jaipur, R49,883 in Marwar, R39,886 in Bharatpur, R36,515 in Bikaner, R34,742 in Mewar, R33,593 in Kotah, R32,375 in Alwar, R9,987 in Tonk, R8,398 in Dholpur, R6,506 in Karauli, R4,058 in Kishangarh, R3,593 in Bundi, R3,093 in Banswara, R2,476 in Dungarpur, R2,358 in Jaisalmer, R1,877 in Shahpura, R1,760 in Pertabgarh and R932 in Kushal- garh. These figures do not include expenditure on new hospitals and dispen- saries incurred in Public Works Departments of the States. 94. The average cost of each case treated in Ajmer-Merwara and in the Native States hospitals and dispensaries was 39 pies and 48 pies against 35 pies and 46 pies respectively. 95. A scheme for improving the position and pay of compounders and dressers in Ajmer-Merwara and other Government medical institutions is still under consideration, as also the question of the increased requirements of the Ajmer Victoria Hospital both in &quot;personnel&quot; and income, etc. MISSION HOSPITALS. 96. During the year under report there were six Mission hospitals in Rajputana as in 1908. 97. The following table shows the total number of in and out-door patients treated and operations performed in these institutions in 1909 :DISPENSARIES AND JAILS IN RAJPUTANA. 11 RAILWAY HOSPITALS. 99. There were 797 in and 32,304 out-door patients treated and 636 operations performed during the year under report in six Railway dispensaries on the Rajputana-Malwa Railway within the limits of Rajputana as per detail below :12 JAILS AND MEDICAL STAFF IN RAJPUTANA. 111.

The decrease in the attendance of both in and out-patients treated and operations performed is attributed to the fact that the hospital was under repairs for nearly three months and there was no Lady Doctor for two months during the year. 141. Lieutenant-Colonel Crooke-Lawless inspected the hospital on behalf of Her Excellency Lady Minto and expressed his pleasure at the work done in this institution. 142.
