?REPORT ON INOCULATION IN THE PUNJAB FROM OCTOBER 1ST, 1900, TO SEPTEMBER 30TH, 1901. THIS report, besides dealing with the inoculations performed during the plague epidemic of 1900-01, also reviews the results of the inoculation operations carried out in the adjacent Nawashahr and Garhshankar Tahsls of the Jullundur and Hoshirpur Districts in the hot weather of 1900, which have already been reported on. 2. The present report therefore is in continuation of the Report on Inoculation Operations in the Jullundur and Hoshirpur Districts for 1899-1900, and is a supplement to the Plague Report for 1900-01. 3. The causes of the delay in the submission of this report will be noticed later. 4. In order, as far as possible, to diminish the necessity for reference to the reports mentioned and to make the present report complete in itself, the introduction to the Plague Report for 1900-01, together with certain tabular statements, are reproduced below with certain alterations and additions to be presently referred to, and extracts from the Inoculation Report for 1899-1900 will be given when dealing with inoculation in the Jullundur and Hoshirpur Districts. 5. Inasmuch as the Plague Report for 1900-01 deals only with the epidemic up to the end of July 1901, while the present report deals with the "plague year" from October 1st, 1900, to September 30th, 1901, the statistics given in the introduction of that report and in the statements reproduced from it have been altered in order to complete them up to the end of September 1901. Certain other information, such as the number of villages infected, of plague cases and deaths, and of inoculations performed in the infected districts, has also been added for facility of reference. 6. It will be seen that inoculation was practised in five of the seven infected British Districts and in one of the two infected Native States. The number of inoculations, together with the number of plague cases and deaths, in the infected British Districts and Native States are reproduced in a tabular form below :- Infected districts. Infected towns and villages. Cases. Deaths. Inoculations. 1. Jullundur  178 3,678 1,762 135,454 2. Hoshirpur  53 771 394 45,266 3. Gurdspur  55 2,349 1,436 4,162 4. Silkot  71 2,982 1,857 3,018 5.

?2 7. The same details with the addition of the number of cases and deaths among inoculated persons for the Province from the commencement of plague in October 1897 are tabulated below. 8. It has already been remarked that with the exception of a few isolated cases plague had hitherto been almost confined to the adjacent Nawashahr and Garhshankar Tahsls of the Jullundur and Hoshirpur Districts. The only other place in which an outbreak of plague occurred-as opposed to isolated or imported cases-was the village of Haidon in Patila territory, where 26 cases of plague with 19 deaths occurred in March and April 1900. 9. Until the present year inoculations were entirely confined to the Jullundur and Hoshirpur Districts, and in these districts, with the exception of 6,134 inoculations in eight villages of the Phillour Tahsl on the border of the Nawashahr Tahsil, all inoculations hitherto performed were limited to the Nawashahr and Garhshankar Tahsls. Year. Cases. Deaths. Inoculations. AMONG INOCULATED PERSONS.     Cases. Deaths. 1897-98  3,413 2,114 3,918 8 2 1898-99  419 226 9,184 22 8 1899-1900  859 530 293,628 94 36 1900-01  11,089 6,362 197,278 1,482 541 Total to the end of September 1901 15,780  9,232 504,008 1,606 587 10. The case mortality calculated on the total figures, after deducting the number of cases and deaths among inoculated persons from the gross totals, works out as 60.99 per cent. for the uninoculated and as 36.55 per cent. for the inoculated-a diminution of 24.44 per cent. in favour of the inoculated. 11. The corresponding figures for the year under report are 60.59, 36.50 and 24.09 per cent. respectively. 12. Only a brief reference is necessary to the inoculations carried out elsewhere than in the Jullundur and Hoshirpur Districts, and as the subject of inoculation in these districts forms the most important part of this report, it will be convenient to dispose of matters of minor interest first.

With regard to the inoculation in the Ferozepore District little more need be added to what has been stated in the introduction than that as inoculations were not commenced until after the outbreak of plague at Moga had ceased, no opportunity occurred of testing their protective influence. 14. The circumstance that of the 6,700 inhabitants of Moga 5,300 were inoculated, although both plague and inoculations were new experiences to them, is very greatly to their credit, and is an example of their cordial co-operation with the authorities, which has been mentioned in a previous report. 15. The remaining 287 inoculations, though all performed at Moga, were distributed among the inhabitants of 101 villages, and were intended to disseminate the idea of inoculation, at the same time demonstrating its harmlessness. Of the 5,587 inoculations preformed at Moga, 79 were preformed by Captain Perry, I.M.S., and 5,508 by Major Coleman, I.M.S., the Plague Medical Officer.
?3 Gurdspur and Silkot Districts. Inoculations 7,180. 16.    As there was but one medical staff common  to the two districts  of Gurdspur and Silkot during the epidemic of plague of 1900-01, it will be convenient to combine the inoculations performed during this epide- mic in these two districts together, instead of separately, though separate statistics for each district will be given. 17.    As will appear from the introduction, the  epidemic of plague  was  limited, except for a small outbreak in Silkot  City, to  the  adjoining  Shakargarh  and  Zafarwl Tahsls of the Gurdspur and Silkot Districts. In these two tahsls, which may be considered as one infected area, with a population of 408,353, 125 villages were infected, and 5,321 cases of plague with 3,285 deaths occurred: 7,180 persons were inoculated in this area, of whom 44 were attacked with plague and 19 died. Considering the extent of the outbreak the number of inoculations performed is not large. 18.    Both plague and inoculations  were,  however,   quite   new  to  the people, and much difficulty was experienced in persuading  them to accept  inoculation or any other measure to check the disease. The number of inoculations performed was, however, much larger than the number performed in the Jullundur and Hoshirpur Districts during the first epidemic of plague in the Punjab in 1897-98. 19.    For some time inoculations were confined to officials-reservists and others em- ployed on cordon duty and disinfecting coolies-who were required to submit to the opera- tion as a condition of their employment, and, as will be seen  on   reference to Statements Nos. 2 and 3 attached, of the total number of persons inoculated, 2,810 were   members  of the classes just mentioned.

Inoculations were performed in 20 villages in the Shakargarh Tahsl and in 14 villages in the Zafarwl Tahsl. Of these 34 villages, 5 were uninfected. In very few villages was any considerable proportion of the inhabitants inoculated, and as in most cases inoculation was only begun after evacuation had been completed and the outbreak of plague thereby checked, conditions did not exist except in a very few instances which would permit of the estimation of the protection afforded by inoculation. Of the 44 attacks among inoculated persons, 19 of which were fatal, 14 cases with 4 deaths occurred among disinfecting coolies and 8 cases with 3 deaths among the members of the cordon levy. 21. At Ghamrola, a village in the Shakargarh Tahsl, with a population of 1,386, 705 inoculations were performed, shortly after the discovery of plague there on December 3rd, 1901. As by this time a large number of persons had fled, the inoculated outnum- bered the uninoculated population, though to what extent cannot be determined with cer- tainty. Of the 53 plague cases and 43 deaths which occurred at this village, only 5 cases, 4 of which however were fatal, occurred among inoculated persons. 22. In two villages, Birri and Bholin, which, from their proximity to other villages, seemed to be especially liable to outbreaks of plague, a large proportion of the inhabitants were inoculated with the hope of averting such outbreaks.
?6 The hopes were not realized. Inoculations were carried out in both villages in December 1900, and outbreaks of plague occurred in Birri in February and in Bholin in March 1901. Bholin was, however, the last village in the neighbourhood to be attacked, remaining free from plague for some time after all the surrounding villages had become infected. Although inoculation failed to prevent outbreaks of plague in these villages, the inoculated inhabitants suffered much less severely than did the uninoculated. At Birri, with a population of 304, 214 persons were inoculated, and of the 40 plague cases with 13 deaths that occurred here, only 5 cases with 2 deaths occurred among the inoculated population. At Bholin 163 of its 192 inhabitants were inoculated. The outbreak of plague which occurred here was a severe one, 20 cases with 15 deaths occurring; but, as far as can be ascertained from the hospital records and inoculation registers, only 5 inoculated persons were attacked, all of whom however died. 23.

Patila. Inocalations 3,791. 24. Inoculations were performed in each of the three infected places in the Patila territory during and before the outbreak of plague Particulars are given in the statement below :- Place.

The inoculations at Khamanon Kaln were begun some time after the commencement of the outbreak of plague. The 1,520 persons inoculated included the sepoys on cordon duty. Of the 5 inoculated persons who subsequently contracted plague one was a sepoy who succumbed to the disease. Of the remaining 4 cases one was that of a disinfecting coolie. 26. That only 1,589 persons were inoculated at Bassi, a town of over 13,000 inhabitants, was partly due to the small extent of the outbreak and partly to a rumour that a boy had died from the effects of inoculation. Enquiry, however, proved that this boy was the only uninoculated member of his family and had died of plague ; no other member of his family having been attacked. It was unfortunate that of the 3 deaths among the 9 cases of plague at Bassi, one should have been that of an inoculated person. 27. The inoculations at Khamanon Khurd are of interest, because the majority of them were performed shortly before the outbreak of plague there. As this village is close to Khamanon Kaln inoculation was offered to its inhabitants during the outbreak there, and 421 persons were then inoculated, leaving 348 uninoculated persons in the village. When plague broke out here a few weeks later, 261 more persons were inoculated, and it is stated that, allowing for absentees, the whole population was thus protected. Nine cases of plague with 5 deaths occurred here, all the patients having been inoculated.

As previously indicated,  besides   describing  the inoculation operations in the Jullundur and Hoshirpur Districts during the epidemic of 1900-01, it is necessary to consider the results of the inoculation opera- tions carried out in these districts at the close of the previous epidemic. On account of circumstances that have been mentioned in paragraph 4 of the intro- duction to this report, as well as of others which will appear later, it will be most convenient to deal with the Jullundur and Hoshirpur Districts as one infected area, though separate statistics for each district will also be given. 29.    The following extracts from the Report on Inoculation Operations in the Jullun- dur  and   Hoshirpur Districts from October 1899 to September 1900, and from the Report on Plague in the Punjab from October 1st, 1900,  to  July  31st,   1901,   are  reproduced   in order to give an idea, without the necessity of reference to these   reports,  of the inocula- tion operations  of 1899-1900, the results of which have to be considered in this report, and of the altered conditions, as compared with  former years, particularly with regard to the measures adopted  for dealing with the  disease which  prevailed   during the epidemic of 1900-01. 30.    The Report on Inoculation in the Jullundur and Hoshirpur Districts  in   1899- 1900 is divided into two parts: the first part describes in detail, and considers  the results of the inoculations performed   during  the   epidemic  of   plague; the  second   part  deals with  the   extensive inoculation operations which were carried out, for the most part, after the epidemic had ceased, and with the considerations   which led   to  the   undertaking   of those operations. 31.    The   extracts given below are from the second part of this report, and include a statement showing the number of inoculations carried out in the Jullundur and Hoshirpur Districts  and   the   population   of the infected area: a column has been added showing the number of villages in the area.    It may be added here that this  infected   area  corresponds with the " inoculated area " to be referred to presently: - Inoculation after the subsidence of an epidemic of plague. "The campaign of inoculation about to be described was, however, carried  on  for  the  most  part   in  the absence of plague, after the subsidence of an epidemic, and its object was to prevent a fresh outbreak or failing this it was hoped that any epidemic that might occur would be much less severe and easier to deal with than those of previous years, and that by concentrating attention to such an outbreak it might be possible to finally stamp out plague. It was with this hope that over two hundred and fifty thousand people of the Nawashahr and Garhshankar Tahsls submitted to inoculation during the hot weather of 1900. Considerations which led to the undertaking. "The considerations which led to the undertaking  of inoculation  on  such a  very  extensive  scale were as follows: - Failure to stamp out plague. "First and foremost was the fact that ever since the  first  outbreak of  plague  in  the Jullundur   District in 1897 all efforts to get rid of the disease had failed. "Evacuation, disinfection, cordoning of villages and other measures had been tried, and although there can be no doubt that these operations kept the disease in check, yet they did not succeed in completely stamping it out. "The severe and widespread epidemic which broke out in 1897 subsided during the hot weather of 1898, and the Punjab was declared free of plague in September of that year. "Strong hopes were entertained at the time that plague had been completely stamped out, but it again made its appearance at the beginning of the cold weather. "This outbreak increased in virulence during the early months of 1899, but subsided, like the former one, as the rainy season approached, and like it was followed by another epidemic early in the cold weather. This last epidemic followed the same course as its predecessors, and as village after village became infected, in spite of every effort to arrest the spread of the disease, it was felt both by the officers in charge of plague operations and by the people themselves that unless some more effective measures could be adopted than had hitherto been resorted to, there was little hope of effectually ridding the country of plague. "A second and very important consideration was the attitude of the people towards inoculation.        *        * ********** The inhabitants of infected villages and of those in the neighbourhood had become familiar with the idea of inoculation, and, although a large proportion of the people still had misgivings as to its effects, they no longer regarded it with terror. Report of the Indian Plague Commission on inoculation. Government of India's Resolution. "At this juncture came the publication of  the   Report  of  the  Indian Plague  Commission  on   Monsieur Haffkine's Anti-Plague Inoculation with the Govern- ment of India's Resolution endorsing the conclusions and recommendations of the Commission,
?10 "Up to this time the Medical Officers on plague duty had little more than their own personal opinion to support their advocacy of inoculation. This opinion was based partly upon the evidence recorded in a few official reports and in contributions to the medical journals, and partly upon their own somewhat limited experience. Owing, however, to the exacting nature of the duties of the Plague Medical Officers, they had been unable to spare sufficient time for thorough enquiry into the subject. *    *   *  *      *      *       *        *         *        *              * Theory as to means by which infection is kept alive. Perhaps by very mild undetected cases. If these could be prevented, plague might be stamped out. "The manner in which the infection of plague persists in the interval between the end of one epidemic and the beginning of another has not been definitely ascertained. One theory, however, is that, during the apparent absence of the disease, cases occur, which, though so mild as to escape detection, are nevertheless capable of communicating infection, and that when climatic conditions are favourable the disease will resume its ordinary virulence.   The idea was, therefore, suggested that if such mild cases of plague could be prevented, infection would die out and the disease thus be finally got rid of. Inoculation should prevent these mild cases. "It was reasonable to suppose,  moreover,   that,  as inoculation  afforded  considerable protection against plague when its virulence was at its height, it would be all the more effective during the period that infection was only capable of causing mild attacks of the disease. Therefore universal inoculation after an epidemic might stamp out plague. "It followed therefore that if during the  seasonal subsidence of plague the entire community, among whom an epidemic had occurred, were inoculated, there was a fair and reasonable hope that unless some new source of infection were imported, no fresh outbreak would occur. Possibility of such a scheme discussed. Were people likely to accept it? Could the scheme be carried out? "The question that then presented itself was-Was such a scheme feasible ?    Was it reasonable to expect that even for the hope-and it was only a hope-of finally ridding themselves of plague the inhabitants of an exter- sive and densely-populated area would universally accept inoculation, and in the event of the people being willing, would it be possible with the staff and in the time available to inoculate them all ? "The character of the people and their attitude towards inoculation has  already  been  briefly  referred  to, These will be more fully described later. Inducement to people considered sufficient. "It was felt that the prospect, which was held out by universal inoculation, of finally  stamping  out  plague from amongst a community, who year after year had suffered from the troubles and inconveniences brought upon them by a succession of epidemics, afforded sufficient inducement to the great majority of the people for accepting a measure, of the efficacy of which they had been assured and which only involved a slight and temporary inconvenience. Extent of the work. "The extent of the work involved had then to  be considered. Considerations as to area and population involved. Previous experience. "The epidemic of 1897-98 had affected chiefly the central portion of the Nawashahr Tahsfl with some adjoining villages of the Phillour Tahsl Outbreaks had also occurred in the central and northern portions of the Garhshankar Tahsl and in two villages near the eastern   extremity.    Infection   was thus spread   over   an   area   measuring   about  20  miles both in length and breadth. "The succeeding epidemic was chiefly limited to the south-eastern portion of the Nawashahr Tahsl, but four villages were also attacked in the Garhshankar Tahsl, one of which was near its western border, while the other three were in the eastern portion of the tahsl. "The present epidemic was still more extensive, and affected villages situated throughout almost the entire length of both tahsls. In none of the epidemics, however, had the disease shown much tendency to spread across the sandy part of the Phillour Tahsl, and it had never invaded villages in the hills on the north-eastern boundary of the Garhshankar Tahsl. "Although past experience made it seem possible that another epidemic would in due course follow the present one it was impossible to conjecture where the disease would first make its appearance. "The last case of the epidemic of 1897-98 had occurred at Dosanjh Kaln just beyond the western border of the Nawashahr Tahsl; while it was at Karim, nearly 18 miles away, in the eastern part of the tahsl that the first outbreak of the succeeding epidemic took place. This second epidemic came to an end at Karnna near the centre of the Nawashahr Tahsl, while the first case of the present epidemic occurred at Shiba, a village in the eastern portion of the Garhshankar Tahsl, about 15 miles distant. Extensive operations necessary. The task defined. "It will be seen  from  the above  considerations that,  in  order to afford any fair prospect of success in preventing another epidemic, it was necessary that inocu- lation should be carried on throughout a very extensive area before the beginning of the cold weather. It was necessary, in fact, to attempt to inoculate the entire population of the Nawashahr Tahsl, amounting to over 200,000 people, of the greater part of the Garhshankar Tahsl, another 130,000, and of a few villages on the Nawashahr border of the Phillour Tahsl, with a population numbering about 8,800. This infected area was about 500 square miles in extent, and its population amounted to 345,220.    Of this number some 31,000 had been  inocu- lated by the  latter  part  of May; the task that remained therefore was to inoculate over 300,000 persons by the end of September. Visit of the Commissioner to Banga. " On May 26th Alex. Anderson, Esquire, the Commissioner of Jullundur, visited Banga and addressed a meeting of Zaildrs, Lambardrs and other local notables on the sub- ject  of  inoculation.    He pointed  out  that although  the Government had done all in its power during the last three years to stamp out the plague from among the people, it had
?11 not been successful in so doing. He brought to notice the undoubted value of inoculation, saying that if all people would now be inoculated, there was a fair hope that the disease might be finally stamped out, and that if they refused, their blood must be upon their heads. He explained the wishes of the Government, pointing out that although inoculation was perfectly voluntary, yet it was the desire of the Government that everybody should be inoculated. He exhorted his hearers to use every effort to induce the people to accept inoculation freely, saying that the leading men could show their wo th by the help they rendered to the cause of inoculation. Those attend- ing the meeting expressed their willingness to help, saying they would do all in their powers to get the people to be inoculated. Effect of the Commissioner's visit. "The effect of the Commissioner's visit was immediate. Within a week over 6,000 persons had been inocu- lated, and the Deputy Commissioner noted in a diary of June that Captain More had 20,000 persons waiting for inoculation, having inoculated between seven and eight thousand, and that over 10,000 persons in another part of the tahsl were also waiting for the operation. "Zaildrs, Lambardrs and others besought Medical Officers to come to their villages and inoculate their people, all of whom, they said, were willing to be inoculated. Zaildrs vied with each other in the numbers they could produce, and the people themselves eagerly responded to the offer of inoculation. To quote the words of the Commissioner of Jullundur, "the people saw that one more attempt was to be made to eradicate the disease, and they arose to the occasion." "It was felt that no effort should be spared to take advantage of this attitude of the people, and that inocula- tion should be carried far and wide before their enthusiasm had time to cool. "Moreover, the enthusiasm affected officials as well as the people, and all officers and subordinates, civil and medical, exerted themselves to their utmost. "The actual operation of inoculation was, of course, always performed by Medical Officers, but short of this the Civil Officers of all classes did everything in their power to further the cause of inoculation, and con- tributed as much as anybody to the successful completion of the undertaking. Spread of inoculation. "The number of persons inoculated began to increase by leaps and bounds. "Up to the time of the Commissioner's visit about 31,000 inoculations had been performed. During the following week over 6,000 persons were inoculated, while only about twice that number had been inoculated in any previous month. Weekly totals of inoculation. "The weekly totals  steadily  increased-11,000,  13000, 19,000, 29,000-until during the week ending July 14th no less than 34.546 persons were inoculated. Monthly totals. "During June over 73,000 inoculations were performed, bringing total number of inoculated persons to over 100,000, and during July 127.671 persons were inoculated bringing the total number up to over 235,000, and leaving only about a third of the work to be completed. The proportion of the work left undone was really much lees than this, for there were, of course, large numbers of persons who were unfit for inoculation. "During August nearly 47,000 persons were inoculated. By this time comparatively few were left uninoculat- ed who were fit to undergo the operation Lists of such persons were prepared, and the three Medical Officers who then remained were occupied in inoculating "remnants" and between them performed nearly 11,000 inoculations, Completion of the undertaking. "It has been seen that the total population of the infected area amounted to 345,220. Of these 293,628 per- sons were inoculated during the year from October 1899 to September 1900, and of these inoculations nearly 265,000  had  been  performed  since the  Commissioner's  visit  at the end of May, and for the most part after the epidemic of plague had come to an end. Number left uninoculated. "Towards the conclusion of the work forms were issued to the Lambardrs of the villages, which they were asked to fill up, showing the population of the village, the number of inoculated persons, and the numbers remaining uninoculated, whether on account of unfitness from any cause, such as sickness or   unsuitable age,  or  whether for any other reason.

"These returns have  been  compared with the inoculation registers, and from these sources a statement has been compiled showing the details above mentioned, as well as the caste of the inoculated persons The state- ment* will be found in an Appendix, an abstract of it (Statement No. 5) is, however, given on the following page. From it it will be seen that of the population of 345,220, all but 54 106 were inoculated; of those remaining uninoculated, 15,305 were unfit for the operation, 5,630 being considered too young, 5,903 too old, while 3,772 were sick, sickness being held to include pregnancy."

?13 32. The following extracts from the Plague Report of 1900-01 will, together with what has been previously recorded, permit of an idea being formed of the extent of the epidemic of plague in the Jullundur and Hoshirpur Districts and of the altered conditions already referred to: - Measures adopted in the Jullundur District. "The measures adopted for dealing with outbreaks of plague have undergone considerable changes during the present year. As the transition from the former methods to those now in vogue was most complete and gradual in the Jullundur District, these measures will be described here. Such differences as existed in other districts will be referred to when describing the outbreaks there. Methods of obtaining informations regarding the   occurrence of plague cases and plague deaths. Observation. "After plague had disappeared from the Jullundur and Hoshirpur Districts in   June   1900,  the observation agency was continued as it has been ever since its first institution early in 1898. The constitution and the work of the observation agency has been described in the plague reports for 1897-98 and 1899-1900. It therefore needs no further description here. "The system was continued in the above-mentioned area (which included the whole of the Nawashahr Tahsl with the adjoining portion of the Phillour and most of the Garhshankar Tahsl until March, when on account of the spread of plague it became necessary to withdraw, one after another, the Hospital Assistants on observation duty, for employment in infected villages. The same thing happened with ragard to the civil officials employed on plague observation duty, and the system thus gradually came to an end. Observation work was then chiefly carried on by officials on executive duty, Hospital Assistants in charge of infected villages being utilised to examine suspicious cases of illness in neighbouring villages. In June the only members of the medical staff employed solely on observation duty in the Jullundur District were a Hospital Assistant, a local Hakm and four Dhis. "Owing partly to want of staff and partly to the attitude of the people, it was not possible to establish an observation agency in the parts of the Phillour and Nakodar Tahsls which became infected for the first time this year. Measures taken to check plague in infected places. "Until the number of infected villages became so great as to render it impossible   for adequate   supervision to  be maintained,  the   measures  adopted in the infected villages,  with  one  important exception  to  be  presently noticed, remained essentially the same as in previous epidemics. Isolation of sick. Segregation of contacts. Evacuation of villages. "Patients were removed to hospital, contacts were segregated, villages were evacuated, and houses and pro- perty disinfected as formerly. "In the early part of the epidemic inoculation was also extensively practised, but as the disease spread the Plague Medical Officers were so much occupied with other works as to have little time for inoculating. "These remarks apply more particularly to the Nawashahr and Garhshankar Tahsls. In the newly infected part of the Phillour Tahsl the conditions which have been described* when speaking of Nrmahal prevailed for the most part, and from May onwards the people of Nawashahr and Garhshankar Tahsls, even, showed less disposition than they had hitherto done to act in accordance with the instructions of officers on plague duty. The villagers rarely raised difficulties with regard to the removal of the sick to hospital or to the segregation of the contacts. During the latter part of the epidemic, however, they were disinclined to evacuate their villages. It was partly for this reason, though partly also on account of insufficient staff, that many places, such as Rhon, Behrm, Msapur, Malpota, Sahlon and others which would certainly have been completely evacuated under the conditions hitherto prevailing and many of which had been vacated in former epidemics, were now only partially evacuated. Disinfection of property. "The disinfection of personal property has never been a popular measure.   Though in the early part of  the opidemic  this was very thoroughly carried out, it was not possible, as the disease spread, either to induce the   people to submit to it or even, had the people been willing, to carry it out effectively. "The contents of infected houses were disinfected as formerly, but in many villages all that could be done in houses in which no cases of plague were known to have occurred was to prevail upon the people to spread their things out in the sun for several days. "In the early part of the epidemic an attempt was made to disinfect all property as it removed from the village to the camps. This was found impracticable and caused great delay in evacuation of the village, and was consequently hurriedly and often badly performed; it was therefore soon abandoned. The system of disinfect- ing was, however, applied to the contents of infected houses wherever possible. Disinfection of houses and villages. "The disinfection  of  infected houses  and  villages is  a measure understood  and except for the injury to their houses involved in the making of holes in the roofs or walls, much appreciated by the people This measure was therefore carried out in villages where little else could be done, the people themselves in many villages help- ing in the work. Changes in methods of disinfection. Disinfecting gangs. "Very  considerable changes in the  methods of  disinfection have been introduced during the year.   These may be briefly summed up as the substitution of per- chloride of mercury for phenyle for the disinfection of houses, the addition of a colouring matter to the disinfectant with the object of staining the surfaces to which it is applied, and the abandonment of lime-washing. There was a disposition too to make fewer and smaller holes in the roofs of houses, and these were usually restricted to houses known to have been infected. Besides these changes the organisation of disinfecting gangs was more complete than formerly. A certain number of per- manent disinfecting gangs were formed, the members of which, as well as those of temporary gangs, were provided with special clothing while at work, with the object of preventing their own clothes becoming infected, and of protecting their bodies from contact with infected material. Nrmahal. *"On March 31st five cases of plague were discovered at Nrmahal, a town of 8,520 inhabitants on the western boundary  of the Phillour Tahsl, and a severe epidemic followed, lasting until June 28th, when the last reported case occurred. No less than 331 persons were attacked here with plague, of whom 254 died. The people of Nrmahal had largely themselves to thank for this terrible outbreak among them, for they long refused to listen to the advice of the authorities, and it was not until May 6th, by which time 150 persons had died of plague, that the town was evacuated. By this time the people of Nrmahal had become panic-stricken. In spite of this, however, many people refused to Isolate the sick or to go to the segregation camp, and put considerable obstacles in the way of the disinfection of their houses, many returning to the town before the disinfection was completed."
?14 Cordons. " An important feature of the measure adopted in the Punjab for preventing the spread of plague has been the employment of cordons. Cordons have been employed to restrict communication between the occupants of villages or health camps with those of hospital or segregation camps, to prevent unauthorised persons entering evacuated houses or villages (''inner cordons"), and lastly cordons were placed on the boundaries of the lands, belonging to infected villages to prevent their inhabitants scattering and carrying infection elsewhere ("outer cordons") Up to the end of the epidemic of 1899-1900 all these various cordons were employed. There have been modifications in their constitution, army reservists pensioners and others having been gradually substituted for police, the employment of which was discontinued after July 1900 There have also been certain changes in the rules with regard to the length of time during which different cordons were maintained, but until the beginning of the present epidemic the principle was adhered to of restricting the movements of all the inhabitants of infected villages by the means of cordons. The hospital and segregation and inner cordons have been maintained, but with the exception of Mehrmpur, which through a misunderstanding was cordoned for a single day in October last, no village has been surrounded with an outer cordon during the present epidemic." 33. It will be apparent that, in addition to the great change whereby nearly all restrictions upon the intercourse of the inhabitants of infected with those of uninfected villages, the measures for dealing with the disease, although similar to those of former years, were not, except in the early stage of the epidemic, carried out with the same thoroughness as formerly. The insufficiency of the medical staff to which references are made in the above extracts will be best realised by comparing the strengths of this staff in the present with that of former years. This is done in the subjoined statement in which are given the strength of the medical staff present at the height of the epidemic in 1897-98, 1898-99, 1899-1900 and 1900-01 : the number of villages infected with plague during these years is also given, in order that the great weakness of the medical staff during the present year may be the more readily appreciated.  Statement showing the Strength of the Medical Staff on Plague Duty in the Jullundur and Hoshirpur Districts in 1897-98, 1898-99, 1899-1900 and 1900-01. Year. Number of infected Villages. Medical Officers. Assistant Surgeons. Female Medical Practitioners. Hospital Assistant. Compounders. Nurses. Dhis. 1897-98 91 13 5 3 63 49 5 29 1898-99  31 6 0 0 29 13 0 9 1899-1900 78 7 2 0 46 44 0 12 1900-01  231 2* 6 0 49 42 0 14 * One of these was the Civil Surgeon of Hoshirpur who superintended plague operations in his district in addition to his other duties. It will be seen from this statement that in spite of the number of villages infected in 1900-01 being more than twice the number of those infected in 1897-98, or nearly three times as great as those in 1899-1900 the medical staff of the present epidemic was weaker than in either of these previous years and that the weakness was most marked in its most important number-the Medical Officers. 34. With the reduction in the strength of the medical staff there was a corresponding reduction in the executive (Civil) staff, and from what has already been quoted above regarding cordons it will be evident that the establishment employed in connection with the measure was very much smaller than in previous years, This establishment which in 1897-98 consisted of  1 District Superintendent of Police, 4 Assistant District Superintendents of Police, 4 Inspectors, 27 Deputy Inspectors, 272 Sergeants and 2,564 Constables and was in comparison with the smaller number of infected villages but slightly weaker, in 1899-1900 was represented by a few hunderd "reservists" under the orders of the Assistant Commissioner on executive plague duty. 35. From what has been already recorded in this report it will have been made clear that the inoculation operations carried out in the Jullundur and Hoshirpur Districts during the hot weather of 1900 failed to prevent another epidemic of plague in the " inoculated area " which, it may be well to repeat here, was until the present season the only infected area in the Punjab.
?15 36. On the contrary, the epidemic of 1900-01 was more severe and widespread than any of its predecessors, and there were outbreaks of the disease in parts of the districts far beyond the borders of the " inoculated area." There was good reason to hope until the disease made its re-apperance  on October 3rd. 1900, that the object of these inoculation operations had been attained and that plague had been stamped out. For never before since its first appearance in the Punjab had the disease remained so long in abeyance. The interval between the last case of the epidemic of 1897-98 and the first case of that of 1898-99 was 62 days, and between the last case of the second epidemic and the first case of the epidemic of 1899-1900 49 days, while 107 days elapsed before the disease again made its appearance after the occurrence of the last case of the epidemic of 1899-1900. 37. For some time too it seemed as if the alternative hope with which the inoculation operations were undertaken-namely, that any attacks of plague which might follow would be much less severe and, therefore, easier to check than that of previous year- might be realised. 38. A statement is given below in which are shown the plague cases and deaths occurring monthly from October 1897 onwards, from which it will be seen that, except as regards 1898-99, the number of cases up to the end of February was less in the present than in any previous year, and that it exceeded that of the year just mentioned by only 6. It should be said here that the staff on plague duty was much stronger in 1898-99 relatively to the number of infected villages than during any other epidemic: - Statement showing the number of Plague Cases and Deaths in the Jullundur and Hoshirpur Districts monthly from October 1897 to September 1901.  1897-98. 1898-99. 1899-1900. 1900-01.

When it became evident that plague had not been stampted out inoculation was vigorously pushed during the early part of the epidemic of 1900-01. 40. As villages became infected a large proportion of the population not only of the infected villages themselves but of those in their neighbourhood was inoculated. This was only possible as long as plague was confined to a few villages, and when, as after the middle of March the disease spread rapidly, the time of Plague Medical Officers was so occupied with other duties that they were unable to devote much attention to inoculation. 41. A reference to Statement No. 6 attached in which is given the number of inoculations performed in the Jullundur and Hoshirpur Districts, week by week, throughout the year under report, will show that of the 180,720 inoculations performed during the year only 3,815 were performed after the end of March. The number of inoculations performed by each inoculator is given in Statement No. E, Appendix I.

?18 This is in great contrast to the previous year in which, as will have been seen from the extract from the Inoculation Report for that year given above, that of the 293,628 inoculations then performed all but about 30,00 had been performed after the epi- demic had come to an end. The number of inoculations performed during the present was thus far larger than that in any previous epidemic in the Punjab. *Appendix I. 42.    Details  of  these  inoculations  are  shown   in Statements  A*,   B,* C* in the Appendix. Statement C shows the inocu- lations performed in the two districts, while Statements A and B refer only to infected villages, and show not only the inoculations performed in the present but those in the previous year. Statements A and B are really but parts of one statement showing all the infetced villages in the two districts with the number of cases, deaths and inoculations, with certain other particulars: the division has been made for reasons which will appear later. 43.    As in the  early  part  of  the  epidemic   evacuation,   disinfection  and  other measures  were   promptly  resorted   to   in  addition   to   inoculation,   it is not  possible  to determine  with  any   exactitude  the    effect   of any  one  of  these  measures   upon   the outbreaks.    And though later on measures were not so promptly taken, the great pressure of work  rendered it impossible to ascertain with the same degree   of firmness the  inci- dence of plague among the  inoculated   and uninocculated portions of  the population   of infected villages.    For these reasons therefore, in spite of the very large number of inocula- tions performed during  this epidemic, but few reliable   statistics  are  available to  show the results of inoculations in individual villages. 44.    Moreover, as there were no cordons-as there were in former years-to prevent persons   leaving  infected  villages,   the actual population and consequently the proportion between the inoculated and   uninoculated  portions of the population   of  infected  villages can in no instance be determined with accuracy. 45.    Although it is known that some persons fled from infected villages, it is believed that the proportion of the population which left their villages during outbreaks   of  plague in them   was so small as to be almost negligable.    In this connection it   may be remarked that in an almost purely agricultural population, such as that   of  the  infected  parts   of the Jullundur  and Hoshirpur Districts, the necessity   for  attending to the crops-especially shortly   before   and   during   harvest,  when   plague    was   most   prevalent-made    flight almost out of  the question for the great majority of the people. 46.    Fuller   information  has  been  obtained   regarding   certain   villages    and    of others,   and a statement  has  been   prepared-Statement   No. 7 attached-in   which have been shown   the   incidence  and  fatality of plague  among the inoculated and uninoculated portions of the population of those villages  concerning  which   information  is  most  com- plete and reliable.

?21 47. It should be noted that the terms "inoculated" and "uninoculated" refer to the present season only, persons not inoculated during the present season being considered, for the purpose of this statement, as uninoculated. 48. It will be seen that while conditions vary considerably in different villages, the inoculated population are in the great majority of instances much better off both as regards the incidence and fatality of plague than are the uninoculated. Even the uninoculated, however, are a good deal better off in these respects than they were in previous epidemics. Compare the fatality of plague among the uninoculated in the above statement (No. 7) with that of previous epidemics, as shown in the table below-             Cases.    Deaths.        Case mortality                             per cent. 1897-98    ...   3,413     2,114 6194 1898-99    ...     419     226              5394 1899-1900 ... 859     530              6170 In this table cases and deaths among inoculated persons are also included. The case mortality shown is thus slightly-though very slightly-less than the actual. The differenee however is so small as to be negligeable for the present purpose. 49. It will be seen that, while in 1897-98 the case mortality of plague among the uninoculated was 6194 per cent., in 1898-99, 5394 per cent. and in 1899-1900, 6170 per cent., it was only in the villages named in Statement No. 7, 5215 per cent. The peculiar circumstances of this year 1898-99 will be referred to later.

?23 51. The number of cases here shown does not include all attacks among inocu- lated persons, but only those of which particulars could be verified. The circumstances which prevented the record of the necessary details concerning all cases among inoculated persons will be noticed later. 52. It should be mentioned that this statement includes 1,246 cases with 450 deaths in the Jullundur District, 177 cases with 65 deaths in the Hoshirpur District, 31 cases with 14 deaths in the Gurdspur District, and 13 cases with 5 deaths in the Silkot District Consideration of effects of inoculation. " Campaign " of 1900. Difficulty in arriving at con- clusion. 53. There remains for consideration the result of the inoculation operations carried on during the hot weather of 1900. It may be said at the onset the attempt to form a conclusion as to the result of these operations is beset by very considerable difficulties. In the first place, as will have appeared from what has already been written, the conditions which prevailed during the epidemic of 1900-01 differed very considerably from those of previous epidemics in the Jullundur and Hoshirpur Districts. 54. The most important differences were the abolition of restrictions upon com- munication between the inhabitants of infected and uninfected villages and the great diminution in the strength of the staff and establishments on plague duty. This diminution, as has already been mentioned, being most marked with regard to the most important element-the superior officers. Experience has overwhelmingly proved that the chief factor in the spread of plague is human intercourse, and with the removal of restrictions which had hitherto been imposed upon intercourse between the inhabitants of infected and uninfected villages, the conditions for the spread of the disease became more favourable than formerly. Thus the increase in the conditions favourable to the spread of plague was accompanied by a diminution in the staff for dealing with the disease, 55. A second difficulty in estimating the result of the inoculation operations now under consideration lies in the fact that owing to the diminution in the staff and establish- ment on plague duty, it was not possible to obtain the same detailed information regarding plague occurrences as was the case in former years. There is little reason to doubt that the statistics for the epidemic of 1900-01 are very nearly accurate as far as regards the number of plague cases and deaths. In order, however to judge of the efficacy of inoculation, as shown by the incidence and fatality of plague among the inoculated and uninoculated, it is necessary to know the condition of each patient, as regards inoculation, or at any rate this knowledge is necessary with regard to a large proportion of the population. The difficulty in obtaining the information with regard to persons attacked with plague during 1900-01 has been very great and is largely responsible for the delay in the sub mission of this report. In earlier epidemics, where there was at least one Hospital Assistant in charge of each infected village, and where, moreover, Medical Officers saw nearly every case of plague, it was possible to obtain prompt and accurate information and to record at the time of his attack whether a patient had been inoculated or not, with details of the operation. The register of plague patients-hospital registers as they were then called-were in most cases complete and accurate. 56. During the year under report, however, as soon as plague began to spread rapidly, it became necessary to place several villages in charge of a Hospital Assistant or even of a Compounder. It was thus impossible to mention with the same accuracy as formerly the records concerning plague patients, nor could Medical Officers exercise the same supervision as in former years. In the case of several villages no registers of plague cases were maintained during the outbreaks of the disease, but were compiled afterwards from enquiries made on the spot by Hospital Assistants and Assistant Surgeons, when the subsidence of the epidemic permitted of more attention being devoted to this subject. When the names of patients had been obtained it was necessary, for purposes of the present enquiry, to ascertain whether they had been inoculated or not. This involved very serious labour. It was necessary in fact to search in the inoculation registers for the name of each patient. The extent of this work may be appreciated when it is considered that it involved a scrutiny of over 300,000 of entries in the inoculation registers of the infected villages.
?24 Owing to the great pressure of work under which the inoculation operations, both in the hot weather of 1900 and during the epidemic of 1900-01, the inoculation regis- ters had not been indexed. The first thing that was necessary therefore was the index- ing of the inoculation registers and the preparation of a statement showing for each village the registers containing entries of inoculations of its residents. 57. The clerical establishment of the Plague Medical Officers of the Jullundur and Hoshirpur Districts in 1900-01 were very limited, and it is not to be wondered at that the records submitted by Plague Medical Officers were very incomplete. 58. The clerical establishment of the Chief Plague Medical Officer until June 1902, up to which date also the offices of the Chief Plague Medical Officer and Deputy Sanitary Commissioner were combined, consisted of only two clerks. It was thus impossible to check completely the records submitted by Plague Medical Officers, though these were so obviously defective that they were returned again and again for correction and completion, and it has only been by utilising the services of some of the clerks sanc- tioned for Inoculating Medical Officers during the present season of 1902-03 and by temporarily deputing to this duty two of the clerks of the increased office establishment of the Chief Plague Medical Officer that it has been possible to obtain much of the information contained in this report. It is, moreover, only quite recently that some of this information has been obtained. 59. It will be evident from what has been written above that such estimate as can be made of the result of the inoculation operations of the hot weather of 1900 can only be an approximate one. It has been pointed out that the condition of the present epidemic differed greatly from those of epidemics in former years, and that records could not be maintained with the same accuracy as formerly. Nevertheless it is believed that it can be shewn that the "inoculation campaign" of 1900 had very beneficial results. Longer period of freedom from plague than in former years. 60. Attention has already been drawn to the much larger period of freedom from plague which elapsed between the beginning of the present epidemic and the end of its immediate predecessor than between previous epidemics. This period in the case of the Jullundur District was, as stated, 107 days, while in the case of the Hoshirpur District no case of plague is known to have occurred between June 4th, 1900, and March 16th, 1901, a period of over nine months. 61. As far as the Hoshirpur District alone is concerned, it may be fairly claimed that the "inoculation campaign" succeeded in its object; for it is noteworthy that the first two villages, Mazri and Kukowl, which were infected in this district in the present epidemic were outside the inoculated area, infection having been introduced from the Jullundur District. 62. It may be remarked here also that the first case of the present epidemic in the Jullundur District occurred in a village, Mangowl, in which no inoculation had been performed since March 1900. It was not included in the "inoculation campaign" as most of its inhabitants had been inoculated during an outbreak of plague there in Febru- ary and March 1900. Moreover, in none of the four villages infected up to the end of December 1900 had inoculations been performed since the previous May, and of the six villages infected between the end of December 1900 and the beginning of March 1901 there were only two in which inoculations had been performed since the previous June. 63. Attention may also be drawn to the circumstances remarked in the Plague Report for 1900-01 that both in November and December it was possible to declare the Jullundur District "free of plague "-a declaration which implied the absence of the disease for a period of 21 days, a condition which had not occurred at this season of the year since the first appearance of the plague in the Province in 1897. 64. These circumstances are not a little remarkable, especially when the condi- tions which have been already described as existing during the present epidemic are taken into consideration, and but for the "inoculation campaign" there is no known factor to account for them. However, as has been seen, in spite of its mild beginning, the epidemic of 1900-01 was the most severe and widespread that had hitherto occurred in the Jullundur and Hoshirpur Districts. The only previous epidemic which had approached the severity of the present one was that of 1897-98, the first known in the Province. In this epidemic there were 3,413 cases of plague and 2,114 deaths as compared with the 4,449 cases and 2,156 deaths of the epidemic of 1900-01.
?25 Comparison of present epidemic with that of 1897-98. 65. It is with this first epidemic that the present one may be most equitably compared, for in the outbreaks of 1898-99 and 1899-1900 the organisation for dealing with plague had attained a greater degree of perfection, while both the first epidemic and that of the present year was the introduction of new systems for dealing with plague. 66. To begin this comparison therefore attention may be drawn to the great difference in the fatality of plague in 1897-98 and in the present epidemic : in the former year 61.94 per cent. of the attacks proved fatal, while in the present year only 48.46 per cent. of the persons attacked died. These statistics will be considered in fuller detail presently, but it may be remarked here that the difference is one that cannot be accounted for by the abolition of cordon, or to the reduction of the staff on plague duty, and in the absence of other known causes is fairly attributable to inoculation. How much of this difference is due to the "inoculation campaign" of 1900 and how much to the inoculations carried out during the present epidemic remains to be considered. It has been stated that the present epidemic spread beyond the areas to which the disease had hitherto been confined and to which the "inoculation campaign" of 1900 was restricted. It is necessary therefore to consider separately the behaviour of the disease within and without the "inoculated area." 67. Details of plague and inoculations in places respectively within and without the "inoculated area" are given in Statements A and B already referred to. These may be epitomised for the present comparison as follows, while the same particulars regarding the epidemic of 1897-98 are also given below :--      Number of infected villages. Population. Cases. Deaths. Case motality percent. Within "inoculated area"  152 154670 2,761 1,101 39 88 Without "inoculated area"  79 107961 1,688 1,055 62.50 Total 231 262,631 4,449 2,156 48.46 In epidemic of 1897-98  91 91,892 3,413 2,114 61.94  68. This statement brings to light several striking facts, the following of which may be considered here. In the first place it will be noticed that in spite of a much wider spread of plague in the infected area, the number of cases of plague in this area was very much less in the present than in the first epidemic. In spite, that is to say of the number of infected villages being more during the present than in the first epidemic by 61, -an increase of two-thirds,-the cases were less by 652 and the deaths by 1,013. It will be seen, in the second place, that while the case mortality amounted in 1897-98 to 61.94 per cent., it was only 39.88 per cent. within the "inoculated area" in 1900-01. The third fact to which it is desired to draw attention here is that the case mortality without the "inoculated area" compared very closely with that of the epidemic of 1897-98. 69. As has been previously shewn the abolition of restriction between the inhabit- ants of healthy and infected villages was likely to facilitate the spread of plague, and as shewn in the statement just given the number of infected villages in the "inoculated area" in 1900-01 greatly exceeds that of 1897-98.
?26 70. With a greater diffusion of the disease a corresponding increase in the inci- dence of and mortality from plague was also to be expected, and that the opposite occurred can only, in the absence of any other discoverable cause, be attributed to inoculation. It might be argued-especially with regard to the lower death-rate-that the virulence of the disease had abated in this, the fourth, epidemic in the locality. This however is an argument which is unhappily unsupported by the experience of plague in other parts of India. The close similarity of the case mortality of the disease in 1897-98 with that of those parts of the district which though bordering upon were not included in the "inoculated area" goes far towards negativing the supposition that the disease had lost any of its former virulence. This subject will be again referred to. 71. Nothing has as yet been said with regard to the incidence of plague upon the population of the villages in the infected area in which outbreaks of plague occurred in 1897-98 and in 1900-01. The omission is due to the circumstance that among the villages shewn as "infected " in both seasons were many in which only imported of isolated cases of plague occurred, the inclusion of which in the computation of the incidence of plague upon the population of villages in which outbreaks of the disease occurred would lead to the formation of imperfect conclusion, In the statement given below particulars of those villages only have been given in which outbreaks of plague as opposed to imported or isolated cases occurred :- Statement No. 19 showing the Incidence and Fatality of Plague in the Jullundur and Hoshirpur Districts during the Epidemic of 1897-98 and 1900-01.  [Note.-Statistics concerning places in which only isolated or imparted cases of plague occurred have been omitted from this statement.] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Villages. Number. Population. Attacks. Deaths. Percentage of attacks to population. Percentage of deaths to population. Percentage of fatality to attacks. Infected in 1897 98  84 83,748 3,404 2,113 4.06 2.52 62.07 Inoculated in 1900-01. Within "inoculated area" 139 145,549 2,746 1,097 1.89 0.75 39.95  Without "inoculated area" 64 70,788 1,662 1,050 2.35 1.48 63.18   It will be noticed that the incidence of plague upon the population of infected villages was very much lower in 1900-01, both within and without the infected the "inoculated area" than it was in 1897-98. One reason for this lowered case incidence may be found in the circumstance already noticed that it was not until March 1901 that plague began to spread rapidly. Indeed it was not until the middle of March that any outbreak of the disease occurred outside the " inoculated area." There was a much shorter period, therefore, in the present season than in that of 1897-98, for plague to spread through villages, before the arrival of the hot weather checked the epidemic. As far as this circumstance is concerned the "inoculated area" was rather less favourably situated than the other parts of the districts, and the fact that the incidence of plague upon the population was lower within this area than outside it can only be accounted for as the result of inoculation. 72. The possibility that the lowered incidence and fatality of plague within the "inoculated area" might be due to a decrease in the virulence of the disease in this the fourth epidemic has already been referred to and reasons have been given for considering this possibility an unlikely one, This cause of the lowered incidence and fatality of plague
?27 though it might be expected to affect villages in which previous outbreaks of plague had occurred, could hardly be expected to operate in villages which had not hitherto been infected. The statistics concerning previously infected villages should thus be more favourable than those concerning villages in which outbreaks of plague had not hitherto occurred. This, however, is not the case, as an examination of the subjoined statement will show. Statement No. 10 showing the Incidence and Fatality of Plague in Villages in the "Inoculated Area" in the Jullundur and Hoshirpur Districts during the Epidemic of 1900-01. [Note.--Statistics concerning places in which only isolated or imported cases of plague occurred have been Excldued from this statement.] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Villages. Number. Population. Attacks. Deaths. Percentage of   attacks to population. Percentage of deaths to  population. Percentage of  fatality to attacks. 1.   Previously infected     74 86,233 1,706 684 1.98 0.79 40.09 2.   Not previously infected 64 59,316 1,040 413 1.75 0.69 39.71 Total  138 145,549 2,746 1,097 1.89 0.75 39.95 73. From this statement it will be seen that, although the difference is very small, the advantage in every particular is on the side of villages in which no previous outbreaks of plague had occurred. It seems evident therefore that the lessened incidence and fatality of the disease cannot be attributed to any decrease in its virulence, and in the absence of any other known factor may fairly be attributed to inoculation. From what has been written, there can, it is submitted, be little room for doubt that inoculation was of very great benefit in the epidemic of 1900-01. The question as to how much of this benefit is due to inoculation performed during the epidemic and how much to the "campaign" of 1900 is not at all easy to answer. It can hardly be doubted, however, that to the "inoculation campaign" of 1900 is due the lengthened freedom from the disease, which has already been referred to or that the mild and limited nature of the epidemic during the early part of the season was also in a great measure due to the same cause. The great extent to which inoculation was practised during the early part of the epidemic increases the difficulty in estimating the effect of the inoculation campaign of 1900, and the only manner in which such an estimate can be formed is by noting the incidence and fatality of plague in infected villages in which inoculations were and were not carried on during 1901. A Statement No. 11 (attached) has been prepared which shows the particulars- both for villages within and in those without the "inoculated area."

29 In this statement the condition of villages in which 10 per cent. and over of the inhabitants were inoculated in 1901 are compared with those in which little or no inocula- tions were performed during the present plague season. In order to avoid any disturbing element in the calculation of the incidence and fatality of plague which might be introduced by the inclusion of villages in which outbreaks of plague occurred during the hot weather of 1900-only villages the outbreaks in which had ceased by the end of May are included in this statement. Further, no villages are included in which inoculations were performed prior to June 1900; in the case of most villages of the "inoculated area" included in this statement inoculations were performed in July 1900. 74. It will be seen that villages within the "inoculated area" in which inoculations were carried on in 1901 suffered least of all, that except as regards case mortality the villages which come next in this respect were those outside the "inoculated area" of which a large proportion of the inhabitants had been inoculated during the present season. Of the villages in which no inoculations were performed during the present season, those situated within the "inoculated area," suffered less severely than those outside this area.
