No. 4517 General. FROM THE HON'BLE COLONEL H. HENDLEY, M.D., K.H.S., I.M.S., Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Punjab, TO L. FRENCH,  ESQUIRE,  C.I.E., I.C.S., ADDITIONAL SECRE- TARY TO GOVERNMENT, PUNJAB. Dated Lahore, the 6th June 1917. SIR, I HAVE the honour to forward herewith the Annual Report of the Chief Malaria Medical Officer, Punjab, for 1916. An attempt has been made to give a connected account of the Malarial History of the year as it varied from average or usual conditions and to show why, although a repetition of the great outbreak of 1908 was expected, it did not occur. The actual conditions that existed might be described as partaking of the nature of a minor epidemic in endemic areas. It  is of  considerable  interest  that the  City of Amritsar with a fever death-rate  of  68.16  in   1908 showed one  as low as 13.57, the lowest but one since that year of the big epidemic when for a time the activities of  the towns people almost ceased.    The theory of immunity will scarcely account  for  this result, it is indeed contrary to what was expected by its advocates who antici- pated an epidemic-at the same time it cannot  be  said that  this theory  has been discredited as it also depends upon conditions otherwise favourable to an epidemic,  which,  as suggested in   the report,  were owing to peculiarities in the  rainfall inimical to the  growth  of insect  life   as  represented by  the mosquito. Other features of interest in the report are the doubts cast upon the usefulness of fish or waterfowl in connection with the destruction of larv and the negative results obtained in the course of an inquiry connected with the particular species of mosquito responsible for the presence of malaria in the Salt Range. It has been found possible to present this report earlier this year by making arrangements for the local preparation of the maps that accom- pany it. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, H. HENDLEY, M.D., COLONEL, I.M.S, Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Punjab.
No. 171-M. I. OFFICE OF CHIEF MALARIA MEDICAL OFFICER, PUNJAB. TO THE INSPECTOR-GENERAL OF CIVIL HOSPITALS, PUNJAB. Dated Lahore, the 5th April 1917. Has the honour to forward herewith the Annual Report on Malaria in the Punjab during the year 1916, together with an account of the work of the Punjab Malaria Bureau. H. HENDLEY, M.D., COL., I.M.S. Chief Malaria Medical Officer, Punjab.
REPORT ON MALARIA IN THE PUNJAB DURING THE YEAR 1916. I.-Introduction. Situation.-The Province of the Punjab occupies the extreme north- west angle of Northern India. Its northern portion is entirely hilly ; while the remaining part is a great plain extending from the foot of the Himalayas to the desert of Rajputana. It lies between 27-39' and 34-2'N, and 69-23' and 79-2'E, and its total area including Native States, is 136,330 square miles. Natural Division.-The main Natural Divisions of the Province are:- Simla, Kangra and some Native States (Mandi, Suket, Chamba, Nahan, and Simla Hill States). I. The Himalayan Division constitutes that part which lies inside the Himalayan Range and Sawaliks to the extreme north-east. The average rainfall in this Division is over 61" per annum against 31", the average for the whole Province. A part is covered with snow during winter, and hence at this season the climate becomes temperate in character. Hill torrents fed by melting snow and spring rains irrigate the valleys and slopes of the hills. Ambala, Hoshiarpur, Gurdaspur, Attock, Rawalpindi, Jhelum, Sialkot, Gujrat, and Kalsia State. II.-The Sub-Himalayan Division includes the tracts lying at the foot of the Himalayas along the north and east of the Province. The average rainfall is over 33". In this Division the cold weather is marked by great variations due mainly to piercingly cold winds blowing from the Himalayas. The surface is irrigated by hill torrents, rivers and perennial canals. Montgomery, Multan, Muzaffargarh, Mianwali, Pera Ghazi Khan, Jhang, Shahpur, Lyallpur and Bahawalpur State. III.-The North-West Dry Area comprising the districts to the west of the Province. There are a few low hills ascending here and there as high as 5,000 feet, which are dry, barren, and almost waterless. The average rainfall of this tract is under 13", and the temperature in the hot weather is excessively high. Irrigation, except for copious irrigation from perennial canals in the districts of Lyallpur, Shahpur, Jhang, and Mont- gomery, depends on the rainfall. Hissar, Gurgaon, Rohtak, Karnal, Jullundur, Ludhiana, Ferozepore, Lahore, Gujranwala Amritsar, and Loharu, Dujana, Pataudi, Jind, Kapurthala, Patiala, Nabha, Maler Kotla, and Faridkot States. IV.-The Indo-Gangetic Plain, West including on the one hand tracts like Hissar, Gurgaon, and Rohtak, depending for water mainly on the rainfall ; and on the other such highly cultivated and well irrigated tracts as Jullundur, Amritsar, Lahore, and Gujran- wala. The climate is hot and the humidity high during the rainy season. The average rainfall is about 27". Soil.-The soil of the Province for the most part consists of fine silt and clay deposited by the rivers. This soil which is relatively impervious is favour- able to waterlogging becoming more marked when there is a tendency to the formation of a layer of concrete or kunkuar a few feet below the surface level. Flooding : conditions favourable for it in the Punjab. This relative impermeability of the soil, and the want of good natural drainage (except for the mountainous parts) make the country liable to be submerged temporarily, after a heavy rainfall, resulting in large collections of water which take a long time to disappear. Temperature in summer and winter. Lying as it does between 27-39' and 34-2'N., and 69-23' and 79-2' East, the Province is situated in the sub-tropical region, and the temperature during the greater part of the winter ranges between 40 and 70 F. This temperature is inimical to lower insect life. During the hot weather the shade temperature ranges
2 between 80-120 F. or more. The temperature reaches its maximum in June; and with the onset of the rains there is a slight fall, but humidity increases, and remains high during the monsoon months of July, August, and September. In the beginning of October the nights become cooler and a fall in the shade temperature is also very noticeable during the day. These extremes of temper- ature are prejudicial to metamorphic changes which the lower insects, such as mosquitoes, pass through. Suitability of spring and autumn to the development of anopheles. The temperate heat of spring, from the beginning of March to early May, and that of September and October, and the in- crease of humidity in the autumnal months is very favourable to the propagation of the ano- pheline fauna of the Punjab, and to the development of the malarial parasite. Conclusion. It will be seen that the conditions generally associated with endemic and epidemic malaria are present to a high degree in the Punjab-put shortly these are:- (1) Situation of the Punjab in the sub-tropical region. (2) The flatness of much of the country. (3) Liability to flooding. (4) Impermeability of the soil. (5) Great climatic variations. (6) The presence of both temperature and humidity at a certain period of the year favourable to the development of carrier anopheles, to their biting capacity, and to the metamorphic changes of the parasite in the body of the carrier. Past knowledge of malaria in the Punjab. 7. Sudden changes in temperature conducing to chill. From our knowledge of the past history of malaria in the Punjab, we know that:- (1) The Punjab has been visited by nine epidemics of importance since 1868. (2) There are certain areas in the Punjab to which known epidemics of malaria have been limited. The chief of these comprise the districts of Gujrat, Gujranwala, and Shahpur in the north, and Delhi, Gurgaon, and part of Rohtak in the south; others have been the districts of Amritsar, Gurdaspur, Ludhiana, Hoshiar- pur, and Jullundur. (3) Endemic malaria is prevalent in the whole Punjab, as is evidenced by increase in the size of spleen and the presence of malarial parasites in the blood stream of small children. (4) Malaria plays a more important part than any other disease in the consistently high mortality-rate in the Punjab. (5) It affects all classes of people, but the poor are more susceptible to its ravages. (6) Infantile mortality is much influenced by malaria. (7) It has a greater influence on the mortality-rate, more than a high birth-rate even. (8) Malaria kills not less than 350,000 people, annually, in the Punjab. II.-General Considerations. Annual fever deaths in the Province. Comparison with last seven years. During the year under review the total number of deaths from fever was 376,003 against 284,784 in 1915 and 345,471 in 1914 giving a death-rate equivalent respect- ively to 19.44, 14.72, and 17.86. The annual fever mortality in 1916 was by 34,270 more than in any one of the last seven years except in 1909, the year following the
3 last big epidemic. This increased mortality in 1909 was undoubtedly an after effect of the epidemic of 1908, as is evidenced by the facts, that (1) the autumnal fever mortality in 1909 was 85,594 against 92,936 in the year under review and (2) the rate of mortality was more marked during the early months of 1909. Explanation of Charts I and II of Appendix A. This is borne out by Chart I of Appendix A, which shows the mortalities in round figures, and in Chart II, which gives graphically the mortalities per mille. In these charts a fall in total deaths for the year under review is also noticeable. The rise in total deaths last year and in the year 1911 was chiefly due to an epidemic of plague. The same charts show the autumnal fever mortality. The fever deaths during the months of October and November in 1916 were more than double those given in the same months for 1915. The autumnal fever mortality figures for the year under review were 92,936 against 45,686 in the previous year and 70,389 in the year 1914. Antumnal fever mortality for 1916 compared with that of last decade. The following table shows that the fever mortality of the whole or the last decade was at no time higher than it was in 1916 except in 1908 :- TABLE I. Showing the autumnal fever deaths and ratio per mille during the last decade. 1907 1908 1909 1910 1911 1912 1913 1914 1915 1916 Fever  Deaths. Death- ratio. Fever  Deaths. Death- ratio.

Unreliability of vital statistics. It is as well perhaps to mention, that the fallibility of the medium, through which vital statistics are recorded, and the great variety of diseases included under the head of fevers, are duly recognised, but in view of the universality of malaria, the inflation of the figures, by any disease except plague, is not likely to affect the general conclusions arrived at in this report. A short resum of the Punjab meteorological features for 1916. In the month of January the total rainfall was much below the normal, whilst in February it was fairly widespread except in the south-west of the Province. Except for the district of Rawalpindi the fall was much less than the average in March. In April it was hardly half the normal fall. In the north and east the fall was normal, but a little above this in the south-west in May. In June it was remarkably heavy in the hill tracts of Simla and Kangra, and above the average in the plains. Monsoon. The monsoon broke in the middle of July, and was more marked in the north and east of the Province than in the south-west ; the rainfall was remarkably heavy in the neighbourhood of Sialkot, Gurdaspur Lahore, and Montgomery, so much so that it exceeded the normal by 50 per cent. in the north and east, and 21 per cent. in the south-west.
4 The monsoon was exceptionally heavy in the month of August all over the Province, except in Ludhiana, Jullundur, Hoshiarpur, Kangra, and Sialkot. It was something about four times the normal in the south-west districts of Multan, Muzaffargarh, and Dera Ghazi Khan. In September the fall was a little below the normal in the south-west of the Punjab, but up to the standard in the north and the east. The monsoon ended about the close of the first week of October, about a fortnight later than usual. There was only a slight fall on the 16th of December. The weather was thus less disturbed than usual from January to April, it approached the normal in May, June, and September, but was mostly wet in July, August, and the early part of October, and exceptionally dry during the rest of the year. Clouds were noticed in the sky from July to October and the humidity was above the normal during the rainy season. Temperature. The temperature was fairly normal during the year, except that the maxi- mum temperature which was about 2-3 below the normal from May to November, and the minimum below by about the same number of degrees in May, November, and December, but it was higher in October by 2. Conclusion. Although the rainfall during the first two months of the third quarter of the year was much in excess of the normal, and the air damper, it barely amounted to the normal in September in the north and east, and was defective in the south- west. The great heat of July and August was not favourable to the develop- ment of anopheles, and the breeding places, which had been formed during July and August, dried up very quickly during September, when the rainfall was low and showers were easily absorbed. Apart from this, the incessant and heavy downfall of July and August disturbed breeding places so frequently by the addition of fresh water, that there was but little chance for the few anopheles, that are found in these months, to lay eggs which could reach the adult stage. The heavy fall on the 6th of October, the highest recorded in any one day in the Province during the year, served to flush out most of the anopheline breed- ing places, and as cold weather conditions, which are inimical to the propaga- tion of anopheles, set in very quickly, most of the danger, usually accruing from a heavy monsoon, passed away. We gather from this year's experience that an excessive monsoon is, in itself, not sufficient to cause a malaria epidemic but that there must be breaks in it and moderate falls to provide suitable climatic conditions. Besides the climatic conditions that were unexpectedly unfavourable to a repetition of the widespread epidemic of 1908, other factors must be admitted the prosperity of the people leading to increased resistance to disease in the human host, and the absence of marked flooding, owing to the- monsoon being in defect in the hill tracts in the third quarter of the year. III.-Distribution of Endemic Malaria. General increase in the incidence of malaria. The year under review witnessed a distinct general increase in mortality returns under the heading of fever in all the districts but one that of Hissar in the Ambala Division. Comparison of 1916 and 1915 fever figures. The "Fever" deaths in the Punjab accounted for 376,003, with a death-rate of 19.44 per mille of population against 284,784 with the mortality figure of 14.72 per mille in the previous year the lowest on record since 1877 when it was 12.54. Autumnal fever mortality. The autumnal fever mortality-rate in the last decade was highest in the year under review with the notable exception of the year 1908, the year of the last great epidemie.
5 Fever mortality for Punjab districts compared. The distribution of the fever mortality rate in all the 28 districts of the Punjab is given in Table I of Appendix B. It also gives the comparative figure for the last year, and the mean ratio per 1,000 of population for the previous five years. Districts with highest mortality. A scrutiny of this table shows that the highest fever mortality-rate was recorded in the districts of Mianwali with 32.82 per mille, Gujranwala 3087, Muzaffar- garh 2979, Multan 2259, Kangra 2240, Dera Ghazi Khan 299, Rawalpindi 2118, Attock 2099, Sialkot 2089, and Hissar 2006. A reference to the last year's fever mortality figures shows, that the mortality-rates in these districts was 2010, 1689, 2034, 1731, 1741, 1619, 1798, 1813, 1297, and 1485 respectively. All these districts had a much higher rate this year than their quinquennial average. Districts with lowest fever mortality. The districts with the lowest fever mortality-rate per mille were Simla 923, Gurgaon 1294, Rohtak 1427, and Lyallpur 1490. These rates were, with the exception of that for Gurgaon, where it was slightly below, higher than the quinquennial average. Districts where fever figures keep high. From a comparison of the fever figures with the previous quinquennium (vide Table 1 of Appendix B) it will be noticed that the fever death-rate has been persistently high in the districts shown in the table below:- TABLE II. Showing the districts with persistent high fever Mortality.    No. Name of the district. RATIO OF FEVER DEATHS PER MILLE OF POPULATION.

In the three largest towns of the Punjab the fever death-rates of 2113, 1578, and 1357 were recorded in Lahore, Multan, and Amritsar, respectively; the figures for the last years in these towns are shown in the following table:- TABLE III.

?6 Towns with high fever figures. In the smaller towns a fever death-rate as high as 54.41   was   recorded in Begowal, 48.82 in Karor, 44.34 in Kila Didar Singh, 36.01 in Bhakkar, 28.01 in Miani, 27.17 in Khangarh, 25.45 in Leiah, 25.40 in Pind Dadan Khan, 25.39 in  Gujranwala, 25.31 in Wazirabad, 24.16 in Ramnagar, and 24.00 in Sodhara. Towns with low fever figures. Towns affected to a markedly less  extent,  as shown by the fever mor- tality, were   Rewari with 0.69, Gojra with ,2.03, Sargodha 3.05, Shahabad  6.24,   Dharmkot 6.32, Tarn Taran 6.57, Mitranwali 6.91, Hafizabad 6.97 and Akalgarh 7.10. The Provincial fever death-rate of 1944 was exceeded in 14 districts and 26 towns. Towns where fever figures usually  keep up. A study   of Table II   of  Appendix   B shows,   that   the   fever  mor- tality  continued to remain high in the previous five years   in   the   following towns, though the Province as a whole was relatively malaria free:-Karnal, Jagadhri, Burya, Dasuya, Tanda Urmur, Mukerian, Una, Rahon, Kamalia, Dinanagar, Sodhara, Bhera, Pind Dadan Khan, Pindigheb, Kalabagh, Shujabad, Muzaffargarh, Khangarh, Alipur, Leiah, Karor, Dajal, Rajanpur, and Kot Mithan. A study of the last six years' fever figures would appear to   show that this list includes most of the towns where endemic malaria exists. Distribution  of   fever   figures   in   the Punjab. On Chart III of Appendix A it will be seen, that the fall in the fever curve, which had started at the end of December 1915 continued   to   the   close   of  March 1916, being made more conspicuous by the drop in April. There was a slight but distinct rise in May, which-commonly noticed since the introduction of plague into the Province-was probably due to plague deaths incorrectly recorded under the head of "Fever". After May there was a steady fall which continued throughout the months of June and July. This was followed by a rise in August reaching its maximum in November. The out- standing feature of the chart is a very distinct increase in the fever mortality figures during the months of September, October, and November, and its con- tinuance to the end of the year. Description of maps. Map I given in Appendix C gives the comparative figures  of the fever death-rate per  mille for 1915 and 1916 for the districts of the Punjab. Map II is appended in the Appendix C to show the epidemic figures for the whole of the Punjab. The epidemic figure for the districts is given in red and the towns in blue. It is intended to show the variations in the prevalence of malaria and its intensity in different tracts. Maps III and IV are appended in the same Appendix C to show spleen- rates of different places (in which there are dispensaries) taken before and after the fever seasons in the months of June and November respectively. Endemic  and hyper-endemic  centres in the Punjab. The tables  below emphasize the fact, that in most of the towns which were found in the previous year to be endemic or hyper-endemic in the terms of relative intensity from the point of view of malaria, the spleen-rate remained high.

It will be seen that, though the spleen-rate is liable to fluctuations, it tends to keep high, and where this is the case over a number of years, it may be confidently concluded that malaria is endemic, and that it may pass into an epidemic condition under suitable climatic and other conditions. Relation of canal irrigation with fever in Montgomery and Mianwali. Montgomery. A special reference to Mianwali and Montgomery seems called for in this connection. The spleen-rate has considerably increased in both places since the opening of the canal at the end of 1913. The parasite- rate was also determined in Montgomery in September 1913, i.e., before, and in February 1916, i.e., 2  years after, the canal was opened. A glance at the table below will show as measured by these two methods, the extent to which malaria increased in Montgomery on the introduction of canal water:- TABLE VI. Showing the spleen-rate and malaria index before and after the introduction of the canal in Montgomery town. SPLEEN-RATE. PARASITE-BATE. 1913. 1916.  1913. 1916. 416 850  272 2727 This result is confirmed by the statement given below in table form showing the fever cases treated at the Civil Hospital and Jail Dispensary, Montgomery, from 1908 to 1916:- TABLE VII. Name of Dispensary. NUMBER OF CASES TREATED.  1908. 1909. 1910. 1911. 1912. 1913. 1914. 1915. 1916.

?9 was nearly as high. If anything the jail figures are still more striking. A distributary passes through the jail and from the running water in this, larvae were caught which bred out into a carrier species - culicifacies. Specimens of the same species were caught in the jail dairy. The presence of the dairy in the same compound as the jail seems to be undesirable. The canal water breeds out the carrier anopheles which ordinarily feed on the dairy cattle, but if they happen to bite a carrier of malaria in the vicinity, they have the dairy for protection and for feeding, while the parasites are undergoing development in their bodies. This also accounts for the increased amount of malaria in the jail, and that in spite of the prophylactic issue of quinine. Mianwali. As for Mianwali, the canal irrigates the Civil Station, the Jail and Police Lines. The town, supplied by well water, as will be observed from the, following table, has not suffered nearly as badly as the Civil Station although the number of fever cases has increased very markedly since 1913, the year before the opening of the canal :- TABLE VIII.

A glance at the table given above shows that - (1) Malaria is endemic in the Punjab. (2) There has been a marked increase in the fever incidence in the Punjab, and that it is fairly general. (3) As already shown, the fever incidence was very high in the years 1908 and 1909 (the year after the great epidemic), and in 1913. (4) In some of the places the increase in fever cases has seemed to go hand in hand with the opening of canals.
11 IV.-EPIDEMIC MALARIA. Increased incidence of malaria. There cannot be said to have been an epidemic of malaria in the year under review, although the incidence of fever was high, and the number of autumnal fever deaths was more than double that of the previous autumn. The prevalence was fairly universal except for the districts of the Ambala Division, where the rainfall was somewhat deficient in intensity ; it was more marked in the western or south-western districts of Mianwali, Muzaffargarh, and Dera Ghazi Khan, and in some isolated places and rural areas, of which a number were newly irrigated. To discover the amount of intensity in certain towns, and rural circles the following factors are made use of :- 1. Epidemic figures for different towns and rural circles of the Province. 2. Comparison of spleen census figures before, and after the fever season of 1916. 3. Comparison of hospital returns for the previous quinquennium. Epidemic figure. For working out the epidemic figure in the present year, the fever deaths for the month of November were taken for the numerator, and the average monthly fever mortality for the months of February, March, and April for the denominator. This change was necessary, as the fever mortality exhibited its greatest virulence in November. In very many places this year the epidemic figure was above 1, showing that (1) there has been a marked increase in fever incidence, (2) the number of fever deaths exceeded the normal in the months of greatest intensity, and (3) the autumnal recrudescence was markedly conspicuous. The epidemic figure 5 or about it is taken to indicate increased incidence on normal autumnal recrudescence. The towns and rural areas, where the epidemic figure was about 5 or exceeded this number, are given below:- TABLE XI. Showing towns and rural circles with epidemic figure about 5 or above it.

Study of spleen-census maps of 1916. From a comparative study of spleen-census Maps III and IV for 1916 appended in Appendix C, it appears that the places where the intensity of malaria was most marked was in the vicinity of rivers or newly constructed canals.
?13 Spleen-census of November 1916 compared with that of June 1916. The table given below, which, shows a rise to about double or more in the autumnal spleen-rate of 1916 over that of June, indicates the relative virulence of the disease :- TABLE XII. District. Town.

15 Map II in Appendix C. As there were many places where the epidemic figure was 5 or above, it has been thought advisable to prepare and append a separate map (Map II in Appendix C) showing the distribution and intensity of malaria during the year under review. Special note on the malaria of Kangra District. The epidemic figure, the spleen-rate, and the hospital returns fail to show the increase in malaria in the Kangra District, yet the fever mortality figures are higher than any year in the decade except in 1908 :- TABLE XIV.

Changes in the staff. As two members of the staff applied for, and obtained temporary commissions in the I.M.S., the research work of the laboratory was considerably affected.
16 Shifting of laboratory to new tempo - rary building. There was a further dislocation of work,  as the laboratory had to be moved to allow of an extension of the science class rooms of the Government College. Malaria surveys completed. Malaria surveys of Thanesar,   Montgomery, Mianwali, Gujranwala, and Lyallpur taken up  last year, were completed. Short notes on  these will be  submitted as soon as practicable.    A detailed report on the  survey of Thanesar is about to be submitted. Surveys undertaken. Surveys of the towns  of  Gohana and  Khangarh  were undertaken, as malaria is markedly  endemic in both of them. Why Gohana Was chosen. That of Gohana may, it is thought, yield some interesting results owing to a remodelling of the Western Jumna Canal system by which there has been a much lessened supply of water for irrigation. Why Khangarh was chosen. The town  of   Khangarh   has   shown a   very  high rate   of   infantile mortality,   with   a   high   total   mortality   for which fever was mainly responsible. Dissection of anopheles. Some  thousands of  anopheles  were dissected to determine the species of the local  carriers  in  places  under   survey and of other visited during the year. Dissection of A. Rossi. Innumerable   A.   Rossi were again   dissected,   to   decide, if possible, whether they are ever carriers in nature, and if the parasites  could undergo in them changes at any stage of their development ; but with a negative result. It seems, however, that some definite results may be obtained, as in Khewra, with very limited breeding places, the spleen-rate has been found to be as high as 64.46 and the only species found there hitherto is A. Rossi. It has been remarked by certain observers that A. Rossi becomes infected if the larvae breed in brackish water, and Khewra may well furnish confirmation of this observation.                        Visits paid to :- Khewra. The towns of Khewra, Katas,   Choa  Saidan Shah, and Kallar Kahar in the Jhelum District were visited. At Khewa an attempt was made to decide if anopheline larvae could breed in the brackish water of a stream running  at the foot  of the  salt  range,  or   in the waters of small lakes found within the salt mines. No larvae but two imagines of A. Rossi were found after an exhaustive search. The presence of as high a spleen-rate as 64.46 and a parasite-rate of 14.87 in the face of the absence of anopheles fauna is puzzling; it is hoped to throw more light on this problem in the present year. Katas. The town of  Katas  was  visited  to  ascertain whether anopheles larvae were breeding in the sacred tank, in which there are  innumerable  fish.    Larvae  were   found to abound side by side with the fish in the weeds and in the middle of the tank. Specimens of the fish, which, permitted to be caught after exercising a con- siderable amount  of tact,  were identified as   Cirhina Latia (Ham Buch) 8 Fish caught from sacred tank in Katas. specimens and  Barbus  Terio  (Ham  Buch)  97 specimens, both of which, specially when young, are destroyers of insect larvae. From this it would appear as if fish did very little injury to anopheles larvae. A similar result was met with in the tanks at the Shalamar Gardens at Lahore, into which fish of larvicidal species were specially introduced to reduce the number of anopheles larvae.
17 Choa Saidan Shah and Kallar Kahar. Choa Saidan Shah and Kallar Kahar  were visited as the spleen-rate had been found to  be as high   as 68.42 per cent in the one and 87.5 per cent. in the other.  These places are picturesquely situated in a valley, the one on a small stream, the other on a lake which contains slightly brackish water; both are very malarious. M. Listoni hovered in swarms above one's head in the dusk of the evening in Kallar Kahar, even in the middle of December, when it was very cold, much colder than it is in the plains of the Punjab. These places will be kept under observation. Spleen-census before and after fever season of 1916. The spleen-census of school  children under ten years was again carried out in June and November 1916. The results are shown in Maps III and IV of Appendix C.  A comparison of these results gives a fair idea of the limited endemics found in different localities. Visit to Muktsar. The town of Muktsar was visited after it was flooded by the heavy fall of rain-8.5 inches-on the night  of the   13th July.    Fortunately, it was possible to show that the locality- was not ordinarily malarious, and that, if proper precautions, which were indicated, were taken, it was unlikely that great harm, as far as malaria was  concerned, would follow. Quininization scheme. The scheme for quininization of school children, approved  of by  the Local  Government,   for voluntary  adoption  by selected Municipalities was participated in by certain Municipalities in the Rohtak, Gurgaon, Ferozepore, Ludhiana, Lahore, Amritsar, Sialkot (Pasrur), Montgomery, Gujrat (Kunjah), Lyallpur, Jhang, Shahpur (Sargodha), Multan, Muzaffargarh (Jatoi) and Dera Ghazi Khan Districts. A short note on this is given in the chapter on Anti-Malarial Measures. Malaria leaflet. A simple leaflet  on malaria was circulated all over the Province during the fever season. It has been appreciated, and there have been considerable demands for it from the various districts. Correspondence with Director of Public Instruction for providing teat tubes containing mosquitoes. In   answer   to   our   inquiries,  the   Director   of    Public    Instruction was not in favour of Colonel Lane's sug- gestion to supply specimen tubes containing mosquitoes for instructional purposes to schools. He    proposed,   however,  instead, that  Medical Inspectors should be given a small stock, which they could use for demon- stration purposes on visiting schools; where they might leave them, if they thought they would be of use. Something will be done on these lines in the near future, but it will probably be advisable before issuing the tubes to give these Inspectors some preliminary instruction. Improvement of sanitary condition of Lahore and some other places with re- gard to  malaria. Correspondence has  been  kept up  in connection  with  reducing the number of breeding places of anopheles in Lahore and other stations, as Ambala, and Mianwali, and in the improvement of the sani- tary conditions in and around dak-bungalows and rest-houses. Necessity of information of increased incidence of malaria in a place to the Chief Malaria Medical Officer, Punjab. We have tried to obtain special reports from Civil Surgeons on any special prevalence of malaria in their districts, but up to the present no definite information has been afforded. IV.-Anti-Malarial Measures. Quininization scheme. The scheme for the quininization of school children was not  a success. Local authorities had failed to comply  with  the instructions issued, so  that when the time came for them to put them into effect, most found themselves without  the  means of carrying the   scheme  out,  as they had   no  quinine or registers  ready.
18 Steps have been taken to see that this does not occur again. The Central Jail, Lahore, has been asked to keep a good supply of both quinine tablets and registers ready for next season, and the local authorities will be reminded sufficiently early to enable them to make their arrangements. When it became very evident that there would be a large increase in the incidence of malaria, steps were taken to- (1) warn local authorities.; (2) draw their attention to the necessity there was for obtaining a sufficient supply of quinine in advance; (3) depute fourteen Sub-Assistant Surgeons on malaria duty, one- unless otherwise noted-in each of the following districts of the Punjab:- Hissar, Gurgaon, Karnal, Ambala, Jullundur, Ludhiana, Lahore, Am- ritsar, Gurdaspur, Gujrat, Gujranwala (two), and Muzaffargarh (two). In the Dera Ghazi Khan District local arrangements were made to utilise the services of Vaccinators. Observations on the possibility of ducks as agents in redaction of the number of anopheles larvae. Observations have been made to test the presence of ducks in the reduction of anopheles larvae (vide Journal of the American Medical Association, 1914, Volume II, page 1203, Article by S. G. Dixon). Two ponds were chosen in the Lawrence Gar- dens, Lahore; the one used by the ducks in the Zoo, and the other, not so used, near the old kiln. Anopheles larvae were found to breed in large numbers mainly in the duck pond, and all of them, with a very few exceptions, depend- ing on the season, developed into M. Culicifacies and N. Fuliginosus, both carriers of malaria. When the nearness of these ponds to the centre of the Civil Station is remembered, and that the vicinity is much frequented by children, the result of these observations is one requiring attention. It should be noted that the conditions in these ponds are dissimilar, one, the duck pond is shallow, with grassy edges, but the other is deep, surrounded by rank vegetation, with the leaves of overhanging trees decomposing in the water, making it unsuitable as a breeding place for anopheles larvae. It is intended to go further into this in the present year, and if possible make suggestions for a remedy. Note on members of staff. Assistant Surgeon Bawa Harnam Singh Bhalla has been in charge of the laboratory, and has carried out the necessary work in connection with surveys and local in- quiries throughout the year. He has been of the utmost assistance to me, and I have formed a high opinion of his professional ability in all departments of the work pertaining to his special appointment. Assistant Surgeon Raghu Nath has worked consistently in the Labor- atory throughout the year. Assistant Surgeon Kanhya Lal Bhatia served for the whole year. The bureau, when he left for military service, lost in him an efficient and capable officer. Sub-Assistant Surgeon Abdul Ghaffar continued to carry out his duties to my entire satisfaction. Sub-Assistant Surgeon Ghulam Mohi-ud-Din also worked well and for his good work he was promoted to the third grade without examination. The Laboratory Assistants Daulat Ram and Abdul Razaq have been useful both in field work and in the laboratory. The work of the clerical establishment has been satisfactory. H.
