ASSAM:ARMY HEADQUARTERS, INDIA, MEDICAL DIRECTORATE, New Delhi, the 29th November 1939. SIR, I have the honour to submit the accompanying report on the Health of the Army in India for the year 1938. This Report is for the first time being sub- mitted separately in its present form as a purely military report instead of being published as Volume II of the Annual Report of the Public Health Commissioner with the Government of India. Originally Volume II contained details which concerned civilian institutions; but of recent years the contents have been purely concerned with the Army in India, and as such can be more conveniently produced as a military report. The Health of the Army can be regarded on the whole as distinctly satis- factory. Sick rates are tending to stabilise at a satisfactory level; the rate for British Troops at 603.7 per 1,000 is not however quite so low as in the previous year while that for Indian Troops at 421.8 per 1,000 is less than any for the past 8 years. Invaliding has decreased slightly for British and increas- ed very slightly over last year for Indian troops. The rate for the latter is however below any other year for 14 years. On the Frontier although " Peace reigned officially ", troops were con- stantly out on columns or road protection duties, but the health of the troops remained satisfactory throughout the period. In addition to the organised campaign that is waged yearly against mala- rial infection, similar efforts are now being directed by " Spraying campaigns " to control the incidence of Sandfly fever. The results have been satisfactory. In a year in which cholera assumed epidemic proportions over a great part of India Troops were so well protected that only one small outbreak occurred. A wide and ever increasing sphere of activity for the health of troops in India has been that of Maternity and child-welfare which flourishes actively in military cantonments and produces beneficial results. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant, GEO. G. TABUTE AU, Major-General, Director of Medical Services in India. The Secretary, Defence Department (Army Branch), Government of India. A2

The death rate for B. O. Rs. is half that of the pre-war rate while that for officers remains variable. Invaliding on the other hand shows little downward tendency, a fact probably due in part to the increased facilities for rapid transfer of serious cases for further treatment at home and in part to the rising standards of fitness required in our specialised modern army. 2. Officers. Admissions show a rise of approximately 7 per 1,000 the rate per 1,000 of strength admitted to hospital being 428.9 during the year as compared with 421.4 in 1937.

Inspite of an actual reduction of almost 900 admissions to hospital during the year the admission ratio per 1,000 has been 603.7 as compared with 567.8 in 1937 and 580.5 in 1913, a rise of 36 per 1,000 for the rate on the year. The principal causes of admission to hospital showing the increase or decrease compared with the previous year were:4 Malaria continues to hold its place as the principal single disease and shows an increase of 6 per 1,000 although there is hardly any increase in actual ad- missions for the disease. The insect borne group of diseases however shows a decrease of 2 per 1,000 in rate and nearly 400 cases in actuals, the reduction being mainly in dengue, but also slightly in Sandfly fever for which 100 less cases were admitted during the year. The venereal group of diseases with an increase of nearly 4 per 1,000 in the rate actually shows a slight reduction in the numbers admitted for the whole group. Unfortunately this is confined to the cases of gonorrh5 The diseases chiefly responsible were:6 TABLE No. 9.

Summary of Interesting features of the year. (a ) Malaria remains at a most satisfactorily low level inspite of the aftermath of the 1937 Frontier operations. (b ) Although officially there were no operations in progress, war condi- tions prevailed in Waziristan throughout the year and yet ad- mission rates were remarkably small. (c ) Cholera was epidemic in many parts of the country, but the incid- ence amongst military personnel, except for one restricted out- break, was negligible. There were only one British case and 42 Indian cases. (d ) The Enteric Group of fevers which are endemic throughout the coun- try and in places epidemic, have been now reduced. to less than 1 per 1,000 over the whole year both for British and Indian troops. (e ) The Dysentery-Diarrh8 BRITISH9 (c ) Health of civil communities.10 The following note by an experienced officer is worth quoting:11 That the reductions noted in Table No. 10 are not fortuitous and wholly de- pendent on favourable conditions is shown more clearly in the graph below which covers a period of 20 years and includes bad climatic years (1933) and several years of frontier operations. BRITISH12 There is no doubt that anti-mosquito measures in practically all canton- ments have reached a very high degree of efficiency and are carried out with enthusiasm. For troops in cantonments this is certainly, in part at least, the cause of this satisfactory fall in admissions. The considerably higher incid- ence amongst Indian troops compared with British is in part due to the fact that the former tend to go out of the protected cantonment into infested bazaar areas and also proceed on leave away from cantonments. The value of spray- ing as a cheap and efficient anti-mosquito measure in cantonments and camps has been fully proved during the past 2-3 years and is considered to account for the continued reduction in admissions. It is a noticeable feature that groups of infection in particular units are often specifically attributed, and rightly so, to some particular camp, held away from the safety of cantonments. Lahore Cantonment is a good example of the efficiency of measures now adopted within cantonments. These mea- sures are considered later in this report. TABLE No. 11. British malarial cases in Lahore.

In spite of the adverse criticism on the results of treatment with plasmoquine given in the Report of the Health Organisation of the League of Nations in 1933 on the work done in military hospitals in India, 1931, our methods were continued. Our results have fully justified the method and opinions now expressed are the reverse of those expressed in 1933. The standard treatment is now as follows, though experienced medical officers are always entitled to adopt any form of treatment they may wish. British Troops14 TABLE No. 13. Year. Rate.

" The excellent work put in by all units has been more than justified by the reduction of sickness in their ranks " writes the president of the anti- malarial Committee. Units themselves and Brigade Commanders have little doubt that the result is due to their own. anti-malarial measures, although the smaller rainfall of 1938 increased the prevalence of mosquit15 Secunderabad, a practically non-malarious station, has shown a large increase due to the British Regiment who produced 90 out of the 98 cases as a result of infection in Waziristan. In Eastern Command, where excess rainfall was noted, all districts show an increase. Delhi Brigade Area shows the high rate of 117.5 per 1,000 the greater part of this being attributed to relapses in the British Regiment who returned from Waziristan, having been infected at Damdil. An increase in Meerut District is also noted attributed to the practice of allowing men from the hill station of Chakrata to go on leave to Kalsi Camp which lies in the foot hills (terai); an incongruous procedure for troops placed in "cold storage" and which, if allowed, requires the strictest antimalarial pre- cautions. In all India there were only 4 stations with strengths of over 500 in which the malarial admissions exceeded 100 per 1,000 viz . Lucknow 154.1; Delhi 117.5; Razmak 106.5 and Rawalpindi 102.8. Razmak is really a non- malarious station but constant columns on "Hard Scale" into the low mala- rious valleys account for the infections. The types of infection by Commands over the past 3 years is shown in table No. 14 below. The small proportion diagnosed clinically from the total cases is satisfactory. TABLE No. 14.

Sandfly fever. The All-India admission rate for this unpleasant and debilitating, mild fever, which exacts quite a heavy toll, has remained practically stationary for British troops and has been still further reduced for Indian troops. The general rate would have been distinctly less in this year had not Western (Ind.) District produced 178 admissions instead of the 5 cases shown the previous year, because in Northern and Eastern Commands there was a further reduction on last year's satisfactory figures, while Southern Command showed no marked change.
16 TABLE No. 15 Sandfly fevers over past 10 years17 The years 1937-38 may have been peculiarly adverse to sandfly breeding, but there is no evidence that this was the cause of the reduction which has appeared since the very vigorous spraying campaign was started. The Western Inde- pendent District figures in fact show the contrary. In both these years the British troops in Landikotal, the hot bed of sandfly fever infection, were un- salted troops and a high incidence of infection might well have been anticipat- ed. Yet the incidence here has been one-third that of previous years. The conclusion is reached that anti-sandfly measures must be responsible for this welcome reduction of the disease. During these two years an energetic anti- sandfly campaign has been waged under the personal encouragement of the Peshawar District Commander who took the keenest interest in all measures which could be made effective. It is considered that the most important anti-sandfly measure adopted was that of regular spraying of barracks. It is easy to argue "post hoc ergo propter hoc", but the one factor which is now present when the incidence has been reduced and was not present before is this "regular spraying of barracks."

Fevers of the Typhus Group The incidence remains much the same this year with a slight decrease for both British and Indian troops and cases have been widely scattered. TABLE No. 18 Incidence of Typhus Fever19 Western Command (Western Independent District) remains without any cases and the increase in the total cases diagnosed is seen to be due to Eastern and Southern Commands. The recognition of the clinical disease and its confirmation by serological investigation is probably still far from complete, even amongst military per- sonnel, and requires continued study. The disease is probably prevalent in the civilian population in many areas and passes unrecognised under the heading of fever or typhoid. At Kasauli in Northern Command there was this year one definite case of Typhus of the OXK serological type from which a strain has been isolated in guinea pigs. Work has been continued on the reservoir of infection and on the transmission of OXK. Evidence has been collected that rats may serve as the reservoir. Re- garding transmission20 In Northern and Southern Commands there was a slight increase in the admission for this group. Poona and Ahmednagar had 4 cases each amongst British troops. In Western Ind. District there were no British troops cases for the second year in succession. This immunity is definitely attributed to inoculation because such cases as have occurred were amongst officers all of whom were due for inoculation. The prevalence of cases of dysentery shows that the opportunity for infection by intestinal infections was amply present. The relative proportions of the members of this disease group are shown below. TABLE 21 Comparative Table of Types in the Enteric Group21 The comparative effect of the Enteric fever group on British soldiers of over and under one year's service in India is shown below in Table No. 23. Last year comment was made that for the first time no cases had occurred in soldiers of under one year's service in India and the enhanced effects of the new T. A. B. vaccine now issued by the Royal Army Medical College, Millbank and the Central Research Institute, Kasauli, was credited with this achievement. This year this record has been broken and the case incidence has reverted to that of the period 1934-35.

TABLE No. 24 Enteric fevers23 The 1.54% unprotected B. 0. Rs. appear to have been exceedingly lucky. Their apparent immunity to infection may be due to old standing protection, from past inoculation or to the relative protection of sanitary measures, and food protection in barracks. 11. Dysentery, Diarrhoea, Colitis and Amoebic Hepatitis A very different picture indeed is presented by this group compared with those of the previous disease groups which have been steadily reduced. In fact there is a tendency to increase rather than decrease. For British troops this is shown by the graph for the past 6 years which gives a very distinct rise in the rates of cases admitted. Dysentery and Diarrhoea24 TABLE No. 27 The incidence of the Total Dysentery-Diarrhoea Group Year British troops Indian troops 1913 18.5 25.9 1919 45.3 31.1 1925 24.3 20.3 1929 36.3 24.6 1930 40.5 27.7 1931 43.9 22.6 1932 38.2 21.8 1933 40.2 23.3 1934 40.4 30.2 1935 43.1 17.8 1936 40.7 17.2 1937 41.8 17.9 1938 44.8 24.7 A study of the monthly incidence of this disease group by Commands and the All India figures together with the reiterated comments of experienced Hygiene officers indicates clearly that the majority of the infections are flyborne and come from the vast reservoir of adjacent bazaars or cities in which sanita- tion is primitive. The monthly figures are given in the following table.

In the various areas of this vast country there are naturally differences in the periods favourable to fly breeding, but the figures above indicate the two rises in case incidence which correspond with the periods at which fly prevalence is known to increase; namely the spring period of March and April
25 and the moist hot period of July to the end of August. In the south where a double monsoon prevails there is often a second increase in sfly prevalence and of consequent cases of the dysentery group. This year Secunderabad surpassed itself with 103 British admissions and Poona had 76, though Southern Command as a whole showed a decrease in total admissions compared with 1937. The relative incidence of the component diseases of this dysentery group is shown in the following table for six year period. TABLE No. 29 The incidence of Dysentery, Diarrhoea, Colitis and Amoebic Hepatitis Ratios per 1,000 Dysentery. Diarrhoea. Colitis Total. Amoebic Hepatitis.

This is considered to be due to the improvement in laboratory technique and improved methods of diagnosis of cases which now pass to the more definite dysentery groups. In amoebic hepatitis and liver abscess we also have a tendency to reduction which over the longer period from 1920 has been definite. The ratio per 1,000 of amoebic hepatitis, which unfortunately has been doubled in the present year, is still only two thirds that of 1933. The cases of liver abscess have decreased steadily. In the seven year periods 1920-26 and 1927-1933 the average actual admissions were 30.6 and 9.8 respectively and in the last five year period only 3.4. The steady drop in the sub-groups, amoebic hepatitis and liver abscess, is in contrast with the dysentery-diarrhoea sub-group which is undoubtedly fly-borne. This fact seems again to indicate that fly carriage may not be the main cause of spread of these amoebic infections. It was pointed out in last year's report that the extensive improvement in water supplies and the chlo- rination of water may well have been responsible for this, and that chlorina- tion must have a greater effect on the cysts of E. histolytica than. is generally supposed. It is in the fly-borne dysentery-diarrhoea, sub-group, in which there has been no improvement, the rates of incidence ranging steadily about 25 and 16 per 1,000 respectively over a long period of years. A study of the tables and of figures from Commands makes it clear that there has been no tendency for the incidence to be reduced over a period when malaria, sandfly fever and enteric have shown pronounced reductions. Yet dysentery and diarrhoea are strictly preventable diseases. C
26 It is considered that the reason lies in the fact that, having no sound preventive inoculation against these diseases and the diseases being fty borne the sanitation of the surroundings of our cantonments plays a predominant part in the incidence of the infections. The sanitation, " save the mark " of bazaars, even in cantonments and particularly in any adjacent uncontrolled areas, is so bad as to pass the belief of any one who has not studied it. Open ground, nullahs and drains such as exist are freely used as latrines, latrines where they exist afford every facility for flies to obtain easy access to faecal food and the dysenteric infection. Flies can be found breeding every where, massive reservoirs of infection abound in the population and the completely insanitary habits of the bulk of the bazaar population completes the circle of infectivity from the sources of infection to the food of troops. Under these circumstances, until the civil population is educated and the sanitation improved, the only real and possible remedy lies in the protection of food supplies of all kinds for troops, officers and families by fly proofing all places connected with food. In Western Independent District, where there was an increase of 26 cases, Karachi had the majority in February and March while Quetta had them in June, definitely in the fly seasons. An outbreak of dysentery occurred amongst a large draft of R. A. F. men at the Transit camp at Karachi and was held to be due to faulty dish washing and the lack of fly proofing of food stores, dining rooms and kitchen annexes. In Eastern Command, Jhansi had the highest figures for any station in the Command. This was attributed to the fly infestation caused by the municipal trenching grounds which are sited much too near cantonments. Action is being taken to try to remedy this condition. A comparison of the admissions in Jhansi with those at Agra which is relatively near, but has no closely adjacent large bazaars or trenching grounds, is of interest in this connection.

The distribution of the four disease types by Commands shows that there is little variation in them from year to year.

Cholera In spite of the epidemic of cholera which spread explosively over the greater part of eastern and northern India [Paragraph 5(c)] there was only one British case. This occurred in the Lucknow District, a mild case which recovered. Energetic precautions and a very careful watch over possible sources of infection had to be taken in all Commands from eastern Bengal to the limits of the frontier in Peshawar, Kohat, Waziristan and Baluchistan. Except in a few isolated cases amongst Indian personnel these measures proved success- ful. 13. Diseases of the Digestive System With an increase of nearly 200 admissions the rate per 1,000 has risen. 1936 103.1 per 1,000. 1937 99.4 per 1,000. 1938 113.6 per 1,000. This is concomittant with the rise in the general dysentery group and as far as the cases of intestinal infection go is dependent on similar causes. Tonsillitis, which curiously is included in this group, has produced 91 more cases than last year and accounts for a large number of hospital admissions every year (1,453 cases) and is again third in the list of principal causes of admission. C2
28 Of Catarrhal Jaundice there were 256 cases this year and Gastritis pro- duced 326 cases. Pharyngitis which also curiously is included in this list pro- duced 444 cases. In connection with the increase in messing allowance for the provision of suppers, which was introduced in the autumn of 1937, one medical specialist expresses fears that there may be a general increase in digestive disorders because on this account the British soldier receives an extra meat-meal and will now be eating 3 meat meals a day ! We are quite sure that there is little like- lihood of such an untoward effect. 14. Cysticercosis There was only one case of this distressing condition which occurred at Lahore. It was a case typical of the complete unexpectedness of the condition. The details are as follows: Sergeant W. Service in India 10 years. No history whatsoever of worm infection or anything abnormal. He was a patient in hospital for a traumatic ulcer of the leg. A smart and able N. C. O. He was seen by the Assistant Surgeon on duty recovering from a " Fit ". There was nothing to account for this until X-ray revealed the presence of cysticeri in leg and thigh, pelvis and skull. Epilepsy.29 15. Oriental Sore There were only 8 admissions amongst British troops but 86 from Indian troops. But the numbers under out-patient treatment are very consi- derable. The admissions over 5 years are shown below. TABLE No. 33 Oriental Sore Admissions Year British troops Indian troops 1934 5 103 1935 7 67 1936 34 172 1937 12 135 1938 8 86 In the endemic area of Quetta Rs. 2,000 was allotted by Government as a special anti-sandfly measure for Quetta city and surrounding areas. In 1936 the numbers of cases with oriental sore in the military and civil population became great enough to cause anxiety and under the orders of the Government of India, Dr. Smith from the Central Research Institute, Kasauli was detailed to investigate and report. This report showed that conditions were exceptional- ly favourable for sandfly breeding and the spread of oriental sore infections. It recommended the bricking of all the main nullahs. In the cantonment this improvement is now being carried out. The incidence of Oriental Sore in Quetta apart from actual admissions is shown in the following table. It will be seen that the numbers have again jumped considerably. TABLE No. 34 Incidence of Oriental Sore in Quetta Cantonment British troops Indian troops and followers Total 1936 63 448 511 1937 36 165 201 1938 53 391 444 In 1938, of the 391 cases 124 I. 0. Rs. and 137 Followers or 261 cases belonged to the Cavalry Regt., and of these 137 Followers 119 were syces. As far as this area is concerned there must therefore be some factor present in the horse lines which accounts for this prevalence. In pursuance of this feature trials were made with Stomoxys Calcitrans which is abundant in the lines. Mechanical transference by this means was clearly proved by the production on volunteers of sores 5 and 6 months after the experimental bites by this fly. It should be noted however that the condi- tions for ample sandfly breeding in and round these lines has been almost ideal. During the present year traps, spray guns and spraying were extensively used in every barrack and quarter of this unit. The rise in incidence is dis- appointing and arrangements have been made to intensify the campaign and. to ensure protection and to cover of all open sores to prevent transmission to others.
30 16. Minor Septic and Local Injury Groups This combined group of cellulitis and infected injuries, which are so inter- connected as to be suitably regarded as one group, produces, as ever, a very high rate of temporary inefficiency. The total admissions in the present year number over 5,000 for British troops alone while Indian admissions were over 10,000. If considered as one, this group almost invariably heads the list of causes of sickness; hospital admissions are large and barrack treatment cases even larger. From the nature of military training this must of necessity be so to a considerable extent. From the preventive aspect, active measures consist chiefly in ensuring as rapid cures as possible, for this purpose hospital admission is often the most satisfactory method, and in the maintenance of good general health by feeding. The total inefficiency from this group for troops is best summarised in the following table. TABLE No. 35 Minor Septic and Local Injury over the past 10 years British Troops Indian Troops Minor septic Local Injury Total Minor septic Local Injury Total 1929 52.4 56.8 109.2 24.4 37.4 61.8 1930 52.7 58.9 111.6 25.6 38.3 63.9 1931 59.0 61.7 120.7 30.0 41.2 71.2 1932 56.2 58.5 114.7 30.4 43.7 74.1 1933 58.1 60.2 118.3 32.7 48.2 80.9 1934 57.9 62.3 120.2 17.5 49.0 66.5 1935 59.7 62.2 121.9 35.3 53.1 88.4 1936 59.5 61.8 121.3 33.4 52.6 86.0 1937 54.6 57.6 112.2 31.4 52.0 83.4 1938 59.2 62.7 121.9 33.4 58.7 92.1 Cellulitis still retains second place as a single cause of admission to hospital and in spite of a reduction of 11 cases the rate for the year has increased from 41.3 of 1937 to 45-2 this year. Boils show a slight reduction recently. TABLE No. 36 The indicence of Boils British Indian 1936 473 696 1937 346 531 1938 333 645 Local injuries, which include sprains, abrasions, contusions and open injuries, taken as a whole accounted for over 2,500 British admissions. There were 25 deaths which is 7 more than in 1937 but 6 less than in 1936.
31 In Northern Command the incidence was high with an increase from 104.92 per 1,000 in 1937 to 114.03 in 1938. This was largely due to contributions from Waziristan where naturally the local conditions of a state of " peace-war " with repeated columns was very liable to cause these diseases. The general trend is however downwards and, with attention directed to treatment with elastoplast and similar dressings, hospitalization and prolonged periods under barrack treatment are definitely less. The incidence in Northern Command has been as follows. TABLE No. 37 Minor Septic and Local Injury Group for Northern Command. British Troops. (per1000). 1933 140.07 1934 130.50 1935 126.67 1936 121.33 1937 104.92 1938 114.03 The advent of the Sulphonamide group of drugs has also commenced to make a difference in these tiresome cases and even better results may be ex- pected in future. They have begun to be used extensively with uniformly good results in all cases of septic skin infections and a marked shortening of the period of hospitalization. The policy has been to administer 45 grains daily for 3 days followed by 2 days rest and repeated, if necessary.The increased salt ration which received comment in last year's report was continued. Although the advantages aimed at, the reduction of Prickly heat and Boils, have not been proved statistically, the trend of opinion is definitely in favour of this extra issue on account of the general feeling of better health which it appears to give. The effect on the advent of prickly heat is doubtful; but the reduction in the subsequent boils, their number and severity by means of this extra salt appears much more probable. Troops certainly favour it, particularly Indian troops, and scientifically the need for an increased intake to cover the extra loss during hot weather appears to be definite. This extra salt ration also appears to play a part, it may be an even more important part, in the ability of the body to maintain the heat regulating me- chanism during high external temperatures with high humidity. This is referred to again in paragraph 24. 17. Venereal Diseases These diseases which gave an increase of 6.1 per 1,000 the previous year, have shown a further increase this year of 3 per 1,000, though there is a slight decrease in the actual admissions. The admission rate is now 10 per 1,000 more than it was 6 years ago. The increases are from Southern Command and West- ern Ind. District; Eastern and Northern Commands both show a slight decrease. The decrease in Northern Command is not regarded as showing any real tendency to a reduction of infections, in fact 1937 and 1938 are the worst year ever a. ten year period. The comment is made in the annual report that: "There is no doubt that the main difficulty to contend with in the prevention of venereal disease in India is the lack of social amenities and amusements outside barracks, particularly female companionship ". The introduction of the 4 year period of service abroad which has now been sanctioned may have some effect on this aspect of the problem.
32 In Eastern Command with its slight decrease, the Presidency and Assam District had the highest rate with Calcutta as the plague spot of the district. Special disciplinary measures which were introduced in the mid-year appear to have had an appreciable effect in reducing infections. In Western Ind. District the increase was principally in Syphilis and Soft sore with a real fall in the incidence of Gonorrhoea. The comment is made " Has the ready availability of the Sulphonamide Group of drugs in chemists shops anything to do with this ? " It had been stated that the British batta- lion now in Quetta, when recently in Tientsin were known to have been buying this drug there. In Quetta two small fulminant outbreaks were traced to one brothel in a street which is entirely devoted to the same. In Karachi there was an increase of cases from 29 to 70 of Syphilis; 45 of these came from Quetta. In Southern Command there was a sharp rise from 14.70 per 1,000 to 50.28 per 1,000, a rise which was shared by all districts in the Command. The worst stations were Malappuram, Bombay, Madras and Secunderabad. The worst stations for all India with their ratios per 1,000 were: Calcutta (Alipore) 108.0 Karachi 62.2 Bombay (Colaba) 95.1 Agra 56.2 Madras 90.3 Jubbulpore 55.9 Trimulgherry (Secunderabad) 75.5 Lucknow 54.4 Ferozepore 72.6 Cawnpore 53.5 Hyderabad (Sind) 67.2 Quetta 52.1 Lahore 51.6 Although the group as a whole appears to be on the increase in the All India figure and cannot be viewed with equanimity, yet it must not be forgotten that we have here in India a large body of men made fighting fit, young, healthy vigorous and susceptible who, up to the present year, have been serving abroad for 6 years and more at a stretch, away from their accustomed social contacts and amenities. It is little wonder that, temptations being what they are, many men succumb. Even now this is less than 5 men in every hundred over the course of the whole year, a figure which is remarkable for its small- ness. From this it is not meant to infer that preventive measures should not be encouraged, but that the risks are great and probabilities of infection high. Preventive measures are provided in Preventive Ablution Rooms in all units, but inspection has shown that a vast improvement could be made in many of these Preventive rooms and that the use of the rooms could be enor- mously increased. For example in Northern Command it was shown from an examination of the case cards that in 47% of cases Ablution rooms were not used at all and in 24% they were only used. 24 hours after exposure. Or in other words in 71% of infections had not really been used at all. This is a matter to which attention is being directed. As regards treatment the use of the Sulphonamide group of drugs has been stabilised and extendea. Much has been written in the journals on the efficacy of the treatment, but from the military patients point of view the Sulphonamide group has changed the whole outlook of the disease, both for the patient and the doctor. Hospitalization has been markedly reduced and in one large area, Lahore, there had been no cases of relapse in nine months.
33 Complete rest appears to be an essential part of the treatment and. in army cases, where this is practicable, the results are stated to be infinitely better than cases in civil life which do not do so well. There is now also a tendency for the Dermatologist under whom the majority of cases are treated to allow the body to develop and build up its own resistance for a week before any drugs are administered. Results by this method are stated to be definitely superior, recovery is more rapid and relapses are fewer. The total cases of venereal and its groups are shown in the following table. TABLE No. 38 Venereal diseases for 6 years by groups 34 There were only 11 cases of smallpox in 1938 compared with 13 cases in 1937 and 8 cases in 1936. British other ranks produced 5 cases, one each in Peshawar, Bareilly, Meerut, Cawnpore, Mhow, but there were no deaths. British Officers and their wives and B. O. Rs' wives had no cases. Amongst children there were 6 admissions with no deaths, the cases being 2 in Peshawar the others at Meerut, Cawnpore, Ranikhet and Mhow. 19. Cerebrospinal fever There were 2 cases, one of which died at Ranikhet, the recovery case was at Razmak. There were 23 cases amongst Indian other ranks and followers. The majority of cases reported were in Northern Command and occurred in the first quarter of the year. 20. Poliomyelitis There were 6 cases amongst British and none amongst Indian troops. Three of these were at Poona in July, August and September; the others were at Landikotal (April), Dinapore (August) and Jhansi (December). 21. Respiratory Diseases These have shown a slight increase over the past 5 years for British troops though Indian troops have shown a similar decrease. TABLE No. 40 Respiratory Diseases by types35 Influenza has not appeared in any epidemic form until the end of the year when a definite epidemic diagnosed mild influenza appeared in Lahore District and was continued on into the beginning of 1939. The majority of cases were however Indian troops and were not admitted to hospital. Hospital admis- sions for all India totalled 570 cases as compared with 776 of 1937 and 646 of 1936. Tonsillitis and Pharyngitis, which should be included in this group, pro- duced 1,453 and 444 admissions respectively. In Northern Command there is an increase in general respiratory diseases of 11.16 up to a rate of 55.87 per 1,000, the highest since 1933. The increase is almost entirely due to the high rates for Tonsillitis in Peshawar, Rawalpindi and Waziristan districts. Pneu- monia has shown a slight decrease in the Northern area. 22. Tuberculosis There were 50 admissions for Pulmonary tuberculosis and only 1 for other tuberculosis in the present year, compared with 61 and 7 in 1937 and 57 and 9 in 1936. The cases were very evenly distributed throughout India and no instance was noted of special prevalence in any one unit. Owing to the time which this disease takes to manifest itself it is very difficult to assess the source of infection, a problem which frequently arises in pension cases, particularly in the case of Indian troops. There is a general impression that tuberculosis, and pulmonary at that, is on the increase in India. Military figures which may be regarded as reliable do not bear this out as shown in the following table; or rather show that as far as cantonment popu- lations are concerned there is no obvious increase. TABLE No. 42 Incidence of Tuberculosis amongst British and Indian troops over a 5 year period (actuals). Year. British troops. Indian troops. 1934 64 253 1935 69 275 1936 66 233 1937 68 194 1938 51 212 23. Diphtheria. There has been an increase in the numbers of diphtheria cases from all commands so that the all India figure has risen from 40 last year to 53 this year for other ranks. There were no epidemics amongst adults, though Poona had 9 cases, but there were three definite epidemics amongst children at Sanawar, Solon and Barian in Northern Command. These are described in paragraph 28 under children.
36 The general incidence is best shown by the following table. TABLE NO. 43 Diphtheria by Commands in categories37 Of the 22 cases in Lahore District 14 were at Amritsar from one Company of Infantry chiefly in July when there were maximum temperatures up to 112ºF. The one fatal case here was a stout, constipated alcoholic. In the Peshawar District the hot weather in Nowshera was exceptionally severe with high temperatures, at 107º to 111ºF. together with a high relative humidity in July and August. All troops were placed upon Epsoms salts twice weekly with very beneficial effects, the cases of heat stroke and heat exhaustion being 4 each. In Waziristan there were only 2 cases amongst British troops, a point well worthy of note considering the extremely hard physical work and exposure undertaken by all troops on frequent columns in the worst of the hot weather. The importance of occupation, even if it be occupation out of doors in the sun all through the middle of the day, is well shown by this contrast between 2 cases in Waziristan and 14 cases from one Company in Amritsar. Fortunately the shibboleth of " exposure to the sun means sunstroke " is rapidly dying out. It is now beginning to be recognised that the best way of keeping men healthy in the hot weather and preventing heat stroke is not to shut them up in barracks from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M., nor need a large, heavy topi be worn from dawn to dusk, but that men should be fully occupied, outside if need be, throughout the day provided reasonable common sense precautions are taken and immediate notice is taken of any one who appears to be off colour or looks ill. The Waziristan figures of this year, the results during the 1937 operations, the July civil disturbances in Lahore in 1936, the recent experience of training in the hot weather months in certain stations all indicate that heat stroke and heat exhaustion are not inevitable because men are engaged on hard physical duties out in the open throughout the day; but rather the reverse, provided ample drinking water is available, that clothing and feeding are adjusted suitably, that common sense precautions are observed and that any men who appear to be off colour receive immediate attention. There is now one other factor which appears to be of considerable import- ance and that is the maintenance of the total salt content of the body at a proper level. In paragraph 16 the issue of an extra salt ration for the reduction of minor septic conditions and boils was noted. But views are now being expressed that an extra salt ration may be of definite benefit in the maintenance of general health in the hot weather and the prevention or reduction of heat stroke and the effects of heat. A daily excess loss of salt in the perspiration which is not made good in the daily food must after 2-3 months produce a dele- terious effect on the general tone of the body and particularly of the central nervous system. In a short article published in the Royal Army Medical Corps Journal on work done at Peshawar during the year, a medical officer noted that the salt loss was 6.8 grammes or almost 1/4 oz. of salt for a normal route march of 9 miles in the hot weather of Peshawar. He found that the water requirements of a man marching 8 to 9 miles on a day when the tempera- ture is 104.3ºF. in the, shade and relative humidity 47 per cent. was approxi- mately 6 pints of water in order to maintain real fighting efficiency, to which must be added the amount of common salt which has been lost during the day, which is estimated at practically half an ounce. Stokers at hard work in hot climates utilise weak solutions of salt water as their drink. In mines, with high temperature and humidity, the effect of salt drinks are dramatic in effect- ing recovery from incipient heat stroke or exhaustion. The use of increased salt for this purpose is therefore well worthy of consideration in the prevention of heat stroke and more particularly of heat exhaustion.
38 The seasonal incidence of these cases of heat stroke and heat exhaustion are shown below. TABLE No. 46 Seasonal incidence of Heat Effects. (British Troops) . Jan. Feb. Mar. Apr. May June July Aug.

The suspension of any dental standard on enlistment however means that a certain number of even poorer material than in the past, both in number and structure of the teeth, is beginning to arrive who will require even more attention and care than has hitherto been necessary. The proportion of artificial dentures requiring supply or upkeep must also increase. (b) Oral Hygiene. 40 The principal diseases for which British other ranks were invalided are shown below.

In Peshawar the case was associated with an epidemic amongst dogs in which a noticeable feature was the very short incubation period. Anti-rabic treatment is carried out very extensively for all troops and their families. Treatment centres are provided at the military hospital in every large cantonment or where the size of the military population demands it, fifty-five being maintained during the year. In addition subsidiary centres may be established temporarily at any hospital for treatment of any special case or group of cases, so that military personnel need never travel far to receive early treatments. Vaccine is obtained from the Central Pasteur Institute and treatment graded in accordance with the type of injury. The history of each case is carefully assessed and in all cases of doubt or where treatment will allay fears, treatment is given. The total of treatments by districts throughout the country is shown below. TABLE No. 54. District. British. Indian. Total.

In view of the increasing notice and use of this group of drugs reports were called for on their use during the year. These indicate that use has been made of the group for a very wide range of conditions varying from parturition to chickenpox and including 56 separate types of disease. The value of the drug has been fully proved in cases of Gonorrhoea, all septic conditions, several resistant types of skin infection, and very markedly in cases of pneumonia and D 2
44 the acute meningitis infections. The Enteric fever group, tubercular condi- tions such as empyema and peritonitis, and even malaria in certain stages are reported to show rapid improvement under this treatment. The demands have been great and with experience the exhibition of the drug is being put into its proper sphere of action. 32. Hygiene. A. THE CONTROL OF FOOD AND OTHER SUPPLIES. Summary of work carried out at the Military Food Laboratory, Kasauli, during 1938. (a ) There has again been an increase in the work done during the year, a record total of 18,012 having been examined. The total includes work at the Ghi heating centre at Agra. This increase has been achieved without an in- crease of staff, but working hours had to be increased and work rearranged. The value of the work to the Army in India carried out by the highly trained, ex- perienced staff cannot be exaggerated. TABLE No. 55. Summary of samples received, accepted or rejected.

(c )Group A .46 In general the Ghi has been satisfactory, but the acidity of the finished product has been high in certain cases. The limit of 11 points is not exceeded, but it is considered that a 9 point limit should be aimed at before the products leave the Centre. This will allow for a slight rise during storage to the specifi- cation of 11 points which should not be exceeded before issue of the Ghi. The number of samples was 3,973. There were 3 rejections for high acidity and the average figure for acidity was high this season. 23 samples had to be re-heated, 30 samples retreated and 3 samples were completely rejected for dirt alone and 3,917 samples were finally accepted. B. ACCOMMODATION. A sum of Rs. 10,42,989 was provided during 1938 for improvements to existing and provision of new quarters for British personnel, and Rs. 3,10,110. was expended on improvements to existing or provision of new dining halls and cookhouses. Much remains to be done especially in the provision of dining rooms and cookhouses; but where money has been available very definite improvements have been made. Work has actually been carried out at 8 stations in Northern, 2 in Eastern and 6 in Southern Command and at Karachi in Western Independent District. Owing to criticisms of the types and structure of new accommodation to the effect that many of the newer types of quarters were much hotter than the old types of buildings, temperature experiments have been carried out during the year on both types of buildings. The results were very inconclusive and the trials are being repeated during 1939 in three distinct phases throughout the hot weather months. One fact which appears to have been established is that the orientation of the building has a definite effect on the temperatures within that building and the consequent comfort therein, rather than the actual structure of the building, within reasonable limits. In Commands the, following points have been noted:47 The greatest need is for (i ) the construction of modern fly proofed messing blocks (ii ) the construction of fly proofed latrines for all troops and followers and all personnel in barracks, quarters and bungalows. Electrification schemes or work have been carried out at Rawalpindi, Lahore and Kohat and are in progress in several stations in Northern and Eastern Commands. C. HOT WEATHER PRECAUTIONS IN THE PLAINS. From Northern Command, in which troops were on duty for days in the open during the hot weather, it is considered to be proved by the experience of the past few years that:48 At Lahore, which has deep wells of good quality, trouble arose in the distri- bution system, the 20 year old pipes showing grave defects in many parts. At Razmak, where the open channel and exposed pipe supply was a constant source of trouble, 2 tube wells have been completed inside the " wire " but the supply is limited. Traditionally tribesmen were never believed to tamper with water supplies; but during this year they not only cut the supply, but poisoned the water with Picric acid. There were no untoward results. In the Western Independent District at Fort Sandeman one Indian Hospi- tal Corps man, employed as water chlorinator outside the fort, was murdered by a pathan. At Karachi, there have been two acute shortages, and now water is bought from the municipality. Manora now receives a piped supply, the old water barges having been discarded. At Quetta chlorination has been reduced to 0.25, the water is very good. Boring, to augment the supply in case of summer shortage, was commenced in the Hanna river but had to be stopped owing to the action of the local zemindars who exhibited " Oliver Twist " propensities. Swimming baths for British Troops .49 " The Bhairoba Nullah.50 because they did not realize that one good man on this work will keep 10 or more good men out of hospital. The advantage of the method is that units are trained to appreciate the work themselves, it can be continued in camp or any new station, and the money saved on coolies provides ample means for purchase of materials. It should be mentioned that success depended on a keen station commander and a malarial officer who is an enthusiast. At Fort Sandeman from May to November 16,303 anopheles were caught of which 9,036 were A. stephensi; they were considered to come from the Zhob river. Aerial photography was used for malarial surveys. Civil co-operation. 51 Septic Tanks. 52 can pass through gauze of an even finer mesh than this. As a result of these experiments " No. 22 S. W.

Reports indicate progress in the standard of knowledge of camp sanitation and elementary Hygiene amongst officers and men, but there is still much room for improvement. The first essential is that the officers of a unit shall under- stand the principles of sanitation and firmly believe in its importance, both in peace and war. Only by this means can the sanitary chaos of troop concen- trations and movements be avoided. In Northern Command special courses of lectures by the Deputy Assistant Director of Hygiene, or a specially selected officer, was arranged for all officers additional to the training laid down in Regulations for the Army in India, Instruction 341. A combined pamphlet on sanitation, water duties and first aid has now been published and issued to all. Hygiene inspections. 54 agreed that results obtained from the use of H suspensions were inconclusive and of little value as a help to diagnosis. A rising titre of agglutination to TO and AO remained the diagnostic standard. Several publications have recently appeared on the production of Vi antibodies in the blood during an attack of typhoid fever and also during the carrier stage. The authors of these articles suggest that in practically every case of infection or the carrier stage of typhoid fever demonstrable amounts of Vi antibody are developed. In view of the above it was decided that investigations should be carried out by selected laboratories with the possibility of the employment of suspen- sions of Vi strains of typhoid bacilli for agglutination tests as a means of diagno- sis. On the whole results obtained were disappointing but this to a large extent is considered to be due to inexperience of officers concerned in the correct reading of results obtained. Reports were rendered to the Officer in charge, Enteric Laboratory, Kasauli who correlated results obtained. The following extracts are taken from his consolidated report. (a ) A large number of individuals suffering from diseases other than typhoid fever may develop traces of Vi agglutinins in their blood; occasionally this may be considerable. (b ) Although the majority of patients suffering from typhoid fever develop appreciable amounts of Vi-antibody, several cases have been collected where it has not been possible to demonstrate it. (c ) Vi agglutinins were not demonstrated in every carrier. Fours cases were fully investigated, two convalescent temporary carrier. and two healthy permanent carriers (two urinary and two faecal) In two cases definite positive results were obtained. In another the Vi-titre was very low, between 10 and 20, which in view of the presence of traces of this antibody in so many non-enteric cases cannot be considered very significant. In the last example although Vi-antibody was present in low titres during the acute condition none could be demonstrated during the temporary carrier stage. (d ) There is evidence to show that Vi-agglutinins may appear very early in the blood during an infection. In some cases it appears before the O or H, and this fact may explain the very low or, complete absence of, titre obtained in some of the cases where the blood serum was first examined on the 8th day of illness or even later. (e ) It has been stated that there appeared to be little relation between the severity of the disease and the Vi content of the organism responsible. This is well illustrated in a small epidemic investi- gated. In 12 cultures examined from this epidemic (all the cases were very seriously ill and two were fatal) only one was rich in Vi-antigen and four, including one from a fatal case, were almost completely devoid of this antigen and did not appear to be cap- able to give rise to any Vi-antibody. In next year's report it is hoped to record a fuller account of this aid to diagnosis. All workers in Military Laboratories in India are now supplied with Vi suspensions and they have also been issued with detailed instructions con- cernaing the method of carrying out the test and reading results.
55 A standardised Vi anti-serum has also been issued to all laboratories. By the use of this serum comparisons can be made with results obtained, and the type of agglutination that should be obtained in positive cases appreciated. Isolation of Enteric Group organisms from blood culture. 56 (i ) A case of typhoid fever in which pyrexia lasted for 15 days. B. typhosum was first isolated from the faeces on the 25th day of disease and the organism persisted until the 73rd day. The maximum presence of Vi agglutinins was demonstrated on the 32nd day which suggests that a relationship existed between the late excretion of bacilli and the late rise in Vi agglutinins. (ii ) A proved case of typhoid fever in which B. typhosum was isolated both in the primary attack and during a relapse from blood culture. During convalescence paratyphosum C. was isolated from the faeces. It was not possible to establish the fact that the original infection was a double one as it was only after the B. paratyphosum C. had been recovered from the stool that the blood serum was tested for the presence of these specific antibodies. It was then found to contain both the flagellar and somatic antibodies of B. typhosum and B. paratyphosum C., Vi agglutinins were also present. (iii ) A case of infection with B. paratyphosum A. primary pyrexia lasted for 17 days, a relapse however occurred on the 23rd day and the tem- perature then persisted for a further 30 days. During the relapse period the following complications occurred. Severe intestinal haemorrhage, severe haemorrhage from left nostril necessitating plugging, extensive ulceration of the palate and right pillar of the fauces, inflammation of left parotid gland accompanied by cellulitis of the whole of the left side of the neck, double otitis media with perforation of both tympani, cystitis. B. paratyphosum A. was isolated from a throat swab taken during the ulcerative period. The patient recovered. (iv ) A case of infection with B. paratyphosum B. The patient was admitted with all the symptoms of a very acute dysentery. No pathogenic organism was isolated from the stool. Pyrexia persisted for 7 days during which time a blood culture was taken which was negative. During a relapse a second blood culture was taken from which B. paratyphosum B. was isolated. Organisms sent to the Enteric Laboratory, Kasauli for confirmation or iden- tification. 57 choleraic cramps. The temperature rose to 105.6 but recovery was dramati- cally rapid. There were no associated cases although the patient lived in a mess where all partook of the same food. Further investigations have been carried out by the Officer in charge, Enteric Laboratory into the alkalegenes group. Sera has been prepared from a number of non-motile gram negative bacilli that failed to ferment any of the ordinary carbohydrate media. These organisms had been cultivated from the blood of patients suffering from continuous fevers. Serologically related strains were found on seven occasions. These were considered to be B. alkaligenes as distinct from viterio alkaligenes (B. faecalis alkaligenes of Petruscky.) In one case the organism persisted for sometime in the faeces after it had disappeared from the blood. It appears that besides being more than one morphological type in this group of bacteria, there also exist several serological types of the non-motile variety. Dysentery.TABLE No. 56. Comparative statement showing percentage of isolations of dysentery organisms by Commands59 As in previous years isolations from out stations were poorer than those in which a laboratory is located. Lack of organization among the subordinate hospital staffs in details of collection of specimens again being considered to be the main cause. The enlarged clinical side rooms established at Jhelum and Wellington have thoroughly justified their existence. Sub-cultures of all organisms isolated are sent to the parent District Laboratory for confirmation which is also responsible for the supply of media, etc. In the case of Jhelum the percentage of positive isolations from bacillary exudate specimens was 88.9 and from indefinite exudate specimens 45.5. These figures are better than those obtained in several large laboratories. At Wellington the causative organism was isolated from 67·6 per cent of cases of dysentery showing a typical bacillary exudate. Types of dysentery organisms isolated. 60 TABLE No. 57.

62 In Table No. 58 it will be noted that there is little difference between Commands in the percentages of the various infections to the total in the Command. Western (I) Distriot had again this year however higher percentage of B. Sonne infections. These figures represent careful work in 26 laboratories all situated in different parts of India. They have now been very consistent over a period of years and although no figures are available from civil sources it is considered that they represent fairly accurately the various types of dysentery and their respective proportions among the civil population also. Routine examination of menials prior to employ ment. 63 immunisation had been completed. As was to be expected, however, swabs taken from cases of pharyngitis and tonsillitis continued to be positive for C. diphtheriæ for a considerable time after the outbreak of clinical diphtheria had ceased. The true state of affairs was distorted, as it so commonly is in children's schools, by the fact that large numbers of children were found with hypertrophied and septic tonsils in which the C. diphtheriæ lurked for a long time. The probability is that the large majority of these cases of sore throats with swabs positive for C. diphtheriæ were cases of non-specific tonsillitis which were merely incidentally carrying C. diphtheriæ, (i.e. , so-called bacteriological diphtheria), a state of affairs which is common in institutions after mass artificial immunisation has been performed. It is interesting to note that out of 34 cases of this " bacteriological " diphtheria five individuals carried virulent C. diphtheriæ in their noses or throats for more than a month after all clinical signs of sore throat had dis- appeared, and it was only after thorough surgical toilet of the pharynx and posterior nares that they ceased to carry. Three of these persistent carriers were of the nasal type, their throat swabs only rarely showing C. diphtheriæ. This illustrates the very great importance of examining nasal swabs in all carrier examinations carried out with a a view to controlling and tracing the source of an outbreak of diphtheria.

It is the practice now in all laboratories to test samples of water taken from the actual source of supply in addition to samples from taps, etc., as drawn by the consumer. This practice is necessary in view of the age of certain ditstributing systems. It is now understood by all that no result on drinking water for troops is sattisfactory unless there are no faecal B. Coli present in 100 cc. of the samples submitted. Chemical examinations of water are comparatively rarely asked for and numbered 159 as compared with 338 last year. Bacteriological examinations of milk were asked for on more occasions than last year and numbered 395. There were 874 dark ground examinations for the presence of T. pallida in scrapings but as the total number of positives or negatives from cases eventually diagnosed as syphilis were not recorded by all laboratories, it has not been possible to assess these results. The diagnosis of primary syphilis by means of Wassermann reaction or by the demonstration of the presence of T. pallida has been referred to previously. The high figure of 10,702 was reached in cultural examinations of urine which included nearly 1,500 examinations carried out in Kasauli in connection with the investigation of carrier of organisms of the Enteric Group. From the total number of specimens examined in all laboratories B. Coli was isolated on 446 occasions. Again this year the District Laboratory, Rawalpindi was responsible for the greatest number of isolations. There were 349 examinations of scrapings from cases suspected of suffering from tropical sores. Leishman Donovan bodies being found in 80 instances, of which 57 were demonstrated in the District Laboratory, Quetta. This figure is much less than last year when 170 examinations were positive and is interesting in view of the fact that during 1938 there was an increase in the admission rate for sandfly fever. The quantities of serum and agglutinable suspensions issued to laboratories by the Enteric Laboratry, Kasauli were as follows. Agglutinating sera 4,500 ccs. Standard agglutinable suspensions 65,000 ccs. Concentrated agglutinable suspensions 11,000 ccs. Owing to the simplification of the serological diagnostic methods employed for the Enteric Group of Fevers with the adoption of the Felix method only for this work the quantities of the various agglutinable suspensions issued to laboratories is considerably less than last year. The preparation of the Vi-antigens involves much more work, than the preparation of 'H' or 'O' antigens and the time saved by the smaller requirements of Standard Agglu- tinable Suspensions has been more than taken up by these new productions. Apart from the work of supplying these standard products to Military Laboratories the majority of the Medical Schools and larger Civil Institutions in the country apply to this laboratory for sera, suspensions and type cultures. Tissues sectioned and reported on totalled 619 which included a large number of reports on tumours. In addition a total of 194 sections were made from the brains of horses, jackals, monkeys and dogs suspected of having suffered from rabies. Negri bodies were demonstrated on 76 occasions. New methods for staining sections of this nature were suggested by three officers in their annual reports, these are being tried out at present and will be referred to in next year's report.
68 The amount of section work done, apart from the size of the station obviously depended on the interest taken by the officer in charge of the labora- tory and many of the above examinations were undoubtedly carried out for instructional purposes only. The number of antegenous vaccines prepared decreased slightly from last year but numbered 507. During the year 8 medical officers, 6 assistant surgeons and 14 sub- assistant surgeons were trained in laboratory duties and in addition 15 assistant surgeons and 31 sub-assistant surgeons were trained in clinical side room work. This latter training is considered to be of great importance especially as regards the diagnosis of malaria. With very few exceptions nearly all laboratories are now equipped with up-to-date equipment and within reason any special equipment requested for special work has been and can be provided annually. The Medical Directorate's Technical Library has been extensively used by many medical officers throughout India, a total of 109 reference books having been issued on loan throughout the year. It is satisfactory to note that practically all officers commanding hospitals have made special reference in their annual medical transactions concerning the close liaison between the pathologist and medical officers in charge of cases. It is considered to be due in a great measure to this liaison that the results throughout the year have been so satisfactory. 34.

Officers The admission rates for officers which has shown a steady upward tendency for the past 10 years is this year again conspicuous for a rise while the rates for invaliding at 19.86 per 1,000 and for deaths at 10.40 per 1,000 continue to show an annual irregularity. The principal causes of sickness were as follows:86 The principal causes of admissions to hospital were:87 TABLE No. 488 TABLE 6 Principal causes of invaliding for Indian Troops Increase or decrease as compared with 1937 Diseases.

It will be noted that once again Tuberculosis heads the list, pulmonary tuberculosis accounting for 160 of the cases and the total Tubercular diseases form nearly 1/3 of the total cases invalided. The average number of constantly sick in hospital was 1768.29 or 15.78 per 1,000 of the strength compared with 15.15 in 1937. The average sick time to each soldier was 5.76 days and the average dura- tion of each case was 13.65 days compared with 5.53 days and 14.12 days of 1937. Men under barrack treatment (out patients) were 1229.9 per 1,000 com- pared with 1219.1 and 1343.3 of 1937 and 1936 respectively. The combined ratio of constantly sick in hospital plus those constantly under treatment in barracks was 33.22 per 1,000 compared with 33.00 in 1937 and 34.93 in 1936. This represents the total loss per 1,000 per day. These statistics show that the health of the Indian Army has been satis- factory throughout the year although the admission rate of 421.8 per 1,000 is n excess by 30.1 over that of last year. In Commands the features have been a marked decrease in admissions in Western Independent District which offsets an increase in Northern Command. In the former, with 804 fewer admissions, the admission rate was reduced by 58 per 1,000. This remarkable decrease is due to that of malaria. In the latter there has been an increase of 58 per 1,000, but the health of troops is regarded as satisfactory. Troops were out on road protection duties on the Kohat-Bannu road from the beginning of June to the end of the year. The comment is made that it is remarkable how fit troops keep under these semi- war condition, even through the heat of the hot weather. The peak of the sickness curve for all India was in August. The peak in Commands was in August in Northern, Eastern and Southern Commands; but in Western Independent District was in July and in Southern Command there were two peaks in April and August.

92 PRINCIPAL DISEASES AFFECTING THE INDIAN ARMY 40. Principal interesting features of the year (a ) The remarkably small admission rates in Waziristan although war conditions were in operation practically throughout the year. (b ) The continuance of the low admission rates for malaria. There has however been an increase on the very low rate of the pre- vious year. (c ) The continued downward trend of sandfly fever and the remark- able reductions achieved in Northern Command particularly at Landikotal. (d ) Although cholera spread into epidemic proportions in eastern and northern India, extending from Assam to the Afghanistan border, the number of army cases was limited to 42 of which 38 cases occurred in a sudden outbreak amongst troops travelling into Waziristan. (e ) Scabies shows an unusual figure of 10.47 per 1,000 in Northern Command being an increase of 3 per 1,000. The all-India figure is 11.2. (f ) Climatic conditions have not been markedly unfavourable except for the late warm weather which carried malaria far into the autumn, the rainfall in Southern Command which appears to have been extremely favourable to malaria round Mhow and the absence of rain in the Quetta area which though favouring large scale mosquito breeding was accompanied by a marked fall in malarial incidence in military and civil populations. 41. Malaria Amongst Indian troops the admission rate has been 109.7 per 1,000 compared with 97.9 of 1937 and 121.3 of 1936. From over 12,000 cases there were 6 deaths compared with 4 of the previous year and 8 of 1936. The reduction in this disease over the past 10 years is well shown in the table. TABLE 8 Annual admission for malaria93 The incidence of the various types of malaria by Commands is shown below:94 The wave of incidence was prolonged into the autumn in Northern Com- mand owing to abnormal warm weather. In Eastern Command there was a similar delayed fall in the occurrence of cases. In Southern Command malaria was the commonest of all diseases in 9 out of 13 stations. In Western Command admissions have fallen below 100 per 1,000 for the first time on record, the rate being 86.9 per 1,000 in place of 161.89 per 1,000 of the previous year. Hindubagh gives a good example of what can be done, the admissions being reduced from 471 to 232 by concentrated, intelligent action and the expenditure of Rs. 100. Spraying played a prominent part in this. It was remarkable this year how malarial admissions fell away in August and September. 1937. 1938. Admissions in August 32.0 14.5 per 1,000. Admissions in September 54.8 13.6 " " The fall is attributed to concentrated anti-malarial measures in which spraying played a large part. It should be noted however that there was a marked decrease in malaria in the civil population. 42. Sandfly fever With the admissions for this disease down to 517 for the whole of India there has been a continuation of the downward trend. The incidence in the principal districts affected by this disease has been as follows. TABLE 11 Comparative Table of Sandfly fever in Districts Ratios per 1,000. 1937. 1938. Rawalpindi District 18.0 7.6 Peshawar District 15.6 14.2 Sind Brigade 12.7 7.3 Zhob Ind. Brigade 10.9 4.4 Kohat District 8.0 1.8 Baluchistan District 7.1 5.8 It is observed that the reduction has been in the Northern Command, particularly in Rawalpindi District, and the Command figures over 10 years are worth quoting. TABLE 12 Sandfly fever in Northern Command 1929 36.04 per 1,000. 1930 21.54 1931 27.46 1932 27.56 Spraying and fumigation as an anti-malarial measure in cer- tain stations. 1933 16.53 1934 14.85 1935 18.83 1936 18.43 Spraying campaign intensified as an anti-sandfly and anti-mos- quito measure. 1937 10.65 1938 7.10
95 The figures for Landikotal, that hot bed of sandfly fever, are perhaps even more remarkable. sandfly fever in Landikotal 1934 224 cases. 1935 239 " 1936 97 " 1937 27 " 1938 19 " This startling reduction amongst Indian troops may, to some extent, be due to the fact that those forming the garrison during the year came from other parts of the Peshawar district and were presumably "salted" troops, but more of the decrease is really attributable to the use of "Pyefly" spray- ing in barracks, to the whole hearted co-operation of the troops in anti-sandfly measures and to the replacement of the old mud buildings by good modern stone or concrete and the canalisation and making "pukka" of nullahs where feasible. The all-India incidence is shown below. TABLE 13 Sandfly fever Ratios per 1,000. 1934 8.3 1935 7.5 1936 10.6 1937 6.0 1938 4.6 43. Dengue The all India incidence has fallen to 1.1 per 1,000.

96 44. Fevers of the Typhus Group There were only 38 cases amongst Indian troops compared with 43, 48, 45 and 51 of the previous years. In all there were 52 cases amongst Indian personnel, 29 of which were from Northern Command and 14 and 9, respectively from Southern and Eastern Commands. The details have been considered in paragraph 9 of Section I. 45. Enteric Group of fevers The comparison of these diseases has been considered under paragraph 10, Section I. The decline in incidence has been maintained for Indian troops, the admissions being 86 this year. TABLE 15 Case incidence of Enteric Group of fevers97 TABLE 17 Dysentery, Diarrh98 47. Cholera In spite of the wide spread and in places, severe epidemic amongst the civilian population, (see paragraphs 5 and 40), there were in all only 42 cases amongst Indian military personnel. In the previous 10 years there have only been 1 or 2 cases in each year and the present group of cases is due to one isolat- ed outbreak in Waziristan. The Waziristan outbreak .99 At Nowshera in Peshawar District recruits in a Sikh Regiment were found to be very heavily infected on routine examination. Treatment was carried out for all and in 62 men the average increase in weight was 91/2 lbs. with marked improvement of the condition of the trained recruits sent to their units. The Director of Public Health of the Punjab was informed and arrangements were made by him for an anti hookworm campaign in the Ludhiana area and chlorination of certain wells in the Campbellpore District from which these infected recruits had come. 49. Cysticercosis There were no admissions during the year amongst Indian troops or Followers. 50. Oriental sore There were 95 admissions for this condition, but a large number are treated as out-patients. This has been referred to in paragraph 15, Section I. In Quetta the condition had given rise to serious anxiety after the heavy incidence of 1936 and a special grant of Rs. 2,000 was made for preventive measures. The incidence in three years has been:100 There is no indication of any decrease in the admissions for this group. 52. Venereal diseases This group accounted for 837 admissions compared with 812 of the previous year. TABLE 23 Comparison of groups of venereal diseases.101 54. Cerebro spinal fever There were 23 cases of which only 4 occurred outside Northern Command. The seasonal incidence and location are best shown by the table below. TABLE 26 Cerebrospinal fever among I. Os. and I. O. Rs. (1938).102 Pulmonary Tuberculosis, of which there were 188 cases during the year, has given its lowest admission figure for at least 12 years in Northern Com- mand: It is considered that the improvement may be due to better housing conditions which have been introduced since the Great War. There were 160 Indian Officers and I.O. Rs. and 35 Followers inva- lided during the year for Tuberculosis. Pneumonia and Broncho-pneumonia. -The admission rate for these remains practically constant. The total admissions were 561 with 48 deaths, Northern Command producing the highest number while in Southern Com- mand the admissions have again decreased and are half that of 12 years ago. TABLE 28 Annual comparison of Pneumonia.-Actuals 1931. 1932. 1933. 1934. 1935. 1936. 1937. 1938.

With the introduction of the sulphonamide group of drugs this disease which was so feared by Indian troops may be held even more in check. The results of the enquiry into treatment with rectified spirit in saline on which comment was made in last year's report have shown that it has only been used in a few cases. One case, a prolonged case of pleurisy, in which tuberculosis was suspected, improved rapidly with injections of 20 c.c. of 30 per cent. alcohol every fourth day. The sulphonamide group of drugs offers much greater scope. The incidence of the diseases of the group is best shown in table form.

Artillery. Sappers and Miners. Indian Signal Units. Infantry. Trachoma amongst Recruits.-The Secretary, The Indian Soldiers Board, raised the question with the Chief Recruiting Officer, Delhi as to whether there was a real increase in trachoma in the civil population in the principal recruiting areas to account for the increasing number of promising young men who were being rejected on account of trachoma. The matter was taken up with the Public Health Commissioner who replied to the effect that a comparison of the figures for 1935, 1936 and 1937 did not suggest any ab- normal increase in cases treated for trachoma in the recruiting areas of the Punjab and Delhi Province. No special measures were being taken by the Inspector General of Civil Hospitals except by means of lectures and pro- paganda; but that a " Blindness Week " would be held throughout the country early in 1939 to raise an intensive campaign for precautionary measures. against blindness and eye diseases. It is to be hoped that any measures adopted will bear fruit because the concern of the Indian Soldiers' Board over the apparent increase of trachoma.
107 is fully justified by figures available from military records. The numbers rejected for trachoma at the main recruiting centres were as follows:108 It will be observed that comparing 1936 and 1937 the number rejected in 1937 in the Delhi recruiting area was just over 9 times that of 1936. In 1938 the number was less, but still more than 7 times the figure of 1936. It will also be noticed that there has been a marked fall in rejections in the Rawalpindi area in the three years. Even granted that attention is focussed on the condition and that diag- nosis is more accurate, there appears to be a marked increase of the condition in the recruitable population of the Delhi area. 61. Welfare Work among Indian Troops' Families The extent of this work is again noted as increasing steadily in many stations. It is becoming more and more valued by the Indian soldier and difficulties of caste, class and religion are definitely interfering to a smaller degree. Infant welfare work is however largely becoming merged into that of the general care of families and the provision and use of family hospitals in which are provided beds for maternity cases. In fact comment is made in the yearly reports about this to the effect that demands for treatment and for unit or station family hospitals are more pronounced than those for infant welfare work alone. Infant welfare work is however much appreciated and has a very definite value, but the treatment of children and women bulks even more largely. Owing to this demand comment is frequently made that the time is rapidly approaching when the treatment of families of Indian troops and followers and the provision of hospitals for this purpose will have to be recognised as an obligation on central authority. The solution suggested in some cases is the allotment of a portion of the Indian military hospital for this purpose. Where spare buildings exist this may be possible; but the authorised provision of beds for troops and followers will at times be fully required and such encroachments could not be allowed. At present, apart from certain payments of wages and provision of personnel, the whole welfare and families treatment system is run by voluntary effort, by subscription from units, by donation from central charitable funds and by the personal support, both physical and financial, of the wives of officers of the units concerned. In addition a great deal of voluntary work is given by Medical Officers and members of the I. M. D. The opinion of medical officers is that the whole movement is worth while, not only from the point of view of immense improvements in the physical conditions of the families, but also from the beneficial effect on the troops concerned. Three years ago those controlling welfare centres were asked to compile daily registers of the work done and to include these in an annual report for which a proforma was issued. At the end of 1938 a further questionnaire was issued asking for comments on specified lines and in reference to specified diseases. These have been incorporated in the present annual reports to a modified degree, but will be included more fully for 1939. Further details are best discussed in the order given in this questionnaire.

109 (b). Approximate numbers dealt with by welfare centres. 110 The criterion for the establishment of a true families hospital should however be the ability of the garrison to bear the cost of maintenance, apart from the easier question of initial cost. In addition to the provision of welfare centres and family hospitals greater amenities for women and children are being progressively provided in the form of children's playgrounds and schools, purdah gardens for the women and even hot water bathing establishments. At one station, Roorkee, a school opened for 20 children was inundated at once with 50 applicants. In all there are some 80 centres now established111 to bring them late in the disease is mentioned in some stations with conse- quently a higher mortality rate. A seasonal incidence, spring and mid- summer, corresponding to the fly prevalence, has been particularly noted at many stations; but no marked correlation of families' cases to troops' cases has been observed in the majority of reports. Attention to home-visiting and advice on the improvement of local sanita- tion is mentioned in many reports. Diagnoses are made usually on clinical grounds except in the case of in- patients when laboratory facilities are available.

Operations were undertaken in the Shaktu Valley in February and March. In spite of snow and slush and unusual rain the health of troops remained good with a decrease of 67 per 1,000 in the admis- sion rates and a reduction of average constantly sick during the year. In Northern Command the downward trend of sick rates which com- menced 10 years ago has been broken by an increase of 50 per 1,000 during this year. This increase is almost entirely due to Lahore District where there was a jump from 567 to 714 per 1,000 for admissions caused by the early return from the hills into areas where malaria was more prevalent than usual and to security posts away from cantonments. In addition there was an unexpected rise in July due to malaria at Razani Camp in Waziristan where half the Razmak garrison spent the summer. Razani is a definitely malarious site with surrounding villages badly infected thereby; sandfly fever was also very high. The death rate was 2.75 per 1,000 which is almost the same as 2.78 of last year and little above the quinquennial average of 2.54. The actual number of deaths was reduced. The chief causes of death were: Local injuries (including 18 gunshot wounds). 0.78 per 1,000 Infectious diseases 0.58,,,, General injuries. 0.39,, 6 TABLE 7.

10 4. Women and Children. The admission rates for women have decreased appreciably during the year. One cause, in the north at least, has been stated to be the later reten tion of women and children in the hill stations owing to the moves of troops in the early autumn after the onset of the War. Admissions for wives of Other Ranks have been reduced by nearly 50 per 1,000, 263.9 compared to 311.8 of 1938; and the death rate has fallen from 3.84 to 0.83; the average constantly sick has been reduced by 2 per 1,000 invaliding has been nearly halved compared with 1938. It is remarkable that in the Kohat and Peshawar Districts there have been no deaths amongst wives of Other Ranks for 3 years in succession. It should be remembered of course that the majority of women move to the hills for the summer from these districts. But even in Southern Command with a strength of 1,500 there have been no deaths during this year, ad- missions dropped 155 per 1,000 whereas those of men and children increased. Admissions for members of the Nursing Services fell by 60 per 1,000 to 439.6 but the average constantly sick rate was raised by 2 per 1,000 and the invaliding rate was doubled. Children on the other hand show an increase of 20 per 1,000 for the whole of India to 374.1 and the death rate has been raised by 3 per 1,000, from 9.75 to 12.3 per 1,000. The figure for average constantly sick in hospital is however practically unchanged at 11.43 per 1,000. Fuller details as to the sickness amongst women and children will be found in paragraph 76.

Summary of interesting features of the year. (a) The outstanding feature of the year was the political tension during the summer culminating in the declaration of War against Germany on September the third. (b) The preparation and dispatch of overseas troops and replacements in India went on a pace after the beginning of September; Territorial forces were embodied; protective posts and defence areas were manned at all important points, posts and areas which in many cases were outside cantonments and in highly malarious or unhealthy districts were occupied. (c) Although officially it was peace, Waziristan again had troubles and operations were carried out in the Shaktu Valley in February and March in cold, wet weather and there were continuous columns throughout the year. There were remarkably low admission rates for sickness considering the condi- ions. (d) Tetanus toxoid immunisation was introduced during the year. At first limited to External Defence Troops and later provided for all troops pro- ceeding abroad, provision of Tetanus toxoid is now being made to immunise the whole army. The possibilities of indigenous manufacture of the Toxoid were closely examined but early success was impracticable and indigenous provision was abandoned for the time. (e) There has been a general increase in sick rates for both Officers and men, though there have been no serious epidemics. Invaliding rates have increased appreciably for Officers, but slightly decreased for Other Ranks and death rates have decreased for both. The 4 quinquennial periods since the last war have shown a steady decrease in sickness and death both for Officers and men. (f) Malaria was not severe except in certain areas in the south and east, but in the north, while not extensive in amount, it extended late into the autumn due to a prolonged warmth. The general trend of the graphs of malarial incidence remains satisfactory. (h) The dysentery-diarrhoea group shows no signs of decrease in the numbers of cases and continues to exact a heavy toll in all Commands. (i) Enteric fevers although showing a slight rise in admission rates is held satisfactorily in check although there is ample evidence that it is widely spread around many of our cantonments. (j) Dengue and Sandfly fever were both much in evidence in Eastern Command, the former at Calcutta in the summer, the latter at Agra after abnormal rains in September. (k) Spraying as a defensive measure against all insect borne diseases has been continued with increasing vigour and often with success, particularly in Northern Command, against the Sandfly. Arrangements are now well in hand for production of pyrethrum spray solutions in our own Medical Stores Depots from Empire grown pyrethrum flowers from Kenya. (l) With the advent of War frequent offers of help with special remedies to cure some or all of the ailments of the soldier were received. Some were patriotic and without personal advantage to the offerer, others were on a com- mercial basis. Many were completely useless as for example that of the gentleman who offered to cure all malaria with a few doses of his special medicine which on examination proved to be nothing but common salt. 6. Factors which may have affected the incidence of disease amongst Troops. (a)Climatic conditions. 13 Taking the year as a whole the rainfall was 27 per cent. or more in defect in the Punjab, Sind, Rajputana, Gujarat and north Hyderabad and was nearly up to normal in the South and East. Early in the year there was abnormally heavy rain on the Frontier with enhanced sick rates in February, and in north-west India. This was succeeded after a definite cold wave by a trying hot weather with high humidity. A scanty and deficient monsoon period was followed by a prolonged, warm autumn which carried malaria and sandfly fever into the late autumn months. Defective rainfall was markedly accentuated in Rajputana and West Central areas where famine conditions prevailed. The chief military station affected was Nasirabad where shortage of water lead to evacuation of certain troops. Heavy rainfall in the late monsoon occurred in the United Provinces and eastwards and a very heavy fall round Agra and Cawnpore resulted in a marked rise in sandfly fever, 50 cases in one day at Agra. With the excess rain in Bengal and eastern United Provinces an epidemic of Dengue was recorded from Lucknow and considerable numbers in Calcutta. High summer and autumn temperatures also ruled in this area. In the South rainfall and temperatures were average except on the west coast and in the Bombay area where local excess lead to conditions favouring malaria. The extreme conditions enjoyed by troops in Waziristan are worth. noting. Temperatures which range from the 25 degrees of frost in winter to 122°F in the summer; rain of which half the annual fall may be experienced in one storm and relative humidity which varies from 9 to 99 per cent in the course of a few days. (b) Seasonal incidence of main diseases. 14 ALL INDIA 1939. CHART No. III, BRITISH15 The Government of Bombay after 4 years have had remarkable success in dealing with two big festivals at Pandharpur; and in all Provinces voluntary inoculation has had a considerable effect. The Punjab Government had. expended 1 1/4 lakhs of rupees during 1939 and the Madras Government has arranged a scheme for Rs. 15 lakhs for improvements of the water supply in villages. During the year cholera has been intermittent in different areas. An autumn epidemic in Delhi Province16 returning leave men, reservists and recruits arriving from their homes already infected; in the increased dysentery in certain stations and the relative increase of unfits in depot stations from which units had departed. In fact so great has been the effect of this factor that only a perusal of the sections on disease will show the full effects. After the outbreak of War overcrowding in barracks was common in many stations. This was in most cases only temporary and produced no ill effects, medical officers were however watchful and precautions such as " head and tail " arrangements of beds were put into effect where necessary. One remarkable result is shown in paragraph 64 dealing with hot weather precautions in that British troops and their families could be moved by train during the hot weather months without serious harm, provided adequate pre- cautions were taken throughout the journey. Likewise drafts of young British troops arrived during hot weather months without any grevious consequences. The manning of defensive posts had a marked effect on the health of troops because preventive measures against malaria or sandflies or fly borne dysentery were in some cases not successfully carried through or even not used at all. Civil disturbances affected two groups of troops; one in the east where a small force of troops was out in the Cuttack District for several months and the other in the west where disturbances at Sukkur in November necessitated the presence of troops for some weeks. Health remained remarkably good in spite of troubles with dust, flies and mosquitoes and in spite of camping sites unsatisfactory from every hygienic point of view. Principal Diseases affecting British Troops. 7. Malaria. Considering the conditions malarial admission rates have been satisfactory for all India. It is true that the admission rate at 58.1 per 1,000 is higher than the good years 1935-37, but reductions in total strengths during the autumn partly account for this apparent rise and the early return to the plains and war activities already referred to in paragraph 6(d ) are definitely the cause of the real increase. The increase for all India is entirely due to "Fresh" cases which have risen by nearly 11 per 1,000 whereas "Relapses" have decreased by 3 per 1,000, vide Table 14. The all India incidence of total cases for past years is shown below in Table 12 and even more clearly in graphic form for the past 20 years in chart No. 2. TABLE 12.

[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of 74987704.tif] The seasonal incidence of Malaria for British and Indian troops is well shown in chart No. 5 giving the monthly incidence over the past 5 years:
19 MALARIA ALL INDIA CHART No. V. BRITISH TROOPS =20 In the Western Ind. District a bad malarial year was forecast but very energetic antimalarial measures were instituted and proved so successful that the total cases were the lowest for 8 years. "When it is realised that in the Lora river about 2 miles from and outside cantonments the mosquito larvae were so thick in July that the water presented a heaving black mass and 35,000 mosquitoes were trapped, the majority being almost equally divided between Anopheles subpictus, culicifacies and stephensi; and yet 1939 is the second lowest malarial year on record; one must come to the conclusion that anti.malarial measures were of some avail." As illustrative of the reduction in cases in large cantonments the following table is of interest showing the actual admissions at Rawalpindi and Lahore over a series of years. TABLE 13. British Malarial cases in Rawalpindi and Lahore Actual admissions. Year. Rawalpindi. Lahore. 1924 .. 4370 1925. 473 2245 1926 469 2479 1927 549 1524 1928 370 886 1929 433 1097 1930 133 1320 1931 86 1047 1932 69 679 1933 70 1047 1934 64 371 1935 50 296 1936 106 303 1937 84 171 1938 94 114 1939 41 292 It should be noted that at Lahore a considerable proportion of the British garrison is in barracks in a small enclave in the middle of the town and away from the protection of cantonment hygiene. The beneficial results obtained by spraying barracks, quarters and followers lines with insecticide sprays is becoming more and more evident from reports from all stations. A systemetic programme of spraying is essential. We have now succeeded in introducing an official pyrethrum spray solution at cheap rates for indent purchase from medical stores. This is made available to all anti- malarial officers and may be purchased by individuals for self protection. The concentrated extract or ready made solution are prepared by Medical Stores Depots from Empire (Kenya) produced pyrethrum flowers (see paragraph 64.B). Treatment.21 At the outbreak of War stocks were reviewed and enquiries set on foot to obtain supplies from Empire sources and orders were issued to restrict the use of Atebrin and Plasmoquine to their legitimate use of treatment of malarial cases. The British made drug, Tebetren was investigated and a trial was instituted, but some-what late in the season. The results have been sufficiently good to encourage further trial. The prophylactic treatment of troops with atebrin received a large scale trial in Waziristan, but the results were very indifferent and further use for this. purpose has been stopped. Details of this trial are given in paragraph 64B. (c) (iv ). The following Table gives the admissions for "fresh and relapse" cases by Commands over the past 5 years and shows a satisfactory position for all India and Southern and Eastern Commands for relapse rates, though in Northern and Western Commands relapse rates have increased somewhat.

T. cases and 19 per cent. of malignant tertian cases relapsed it was particularly noticed that it is the same individuals who come into hospital year after year and their condi- tion is probably that of reinfection and not relapse. Malarial situation in Commands.-In Northern Command although there was a moderate increase in total rates due to increases in fresh and relapse, the incidence is markedly less than it was 10-15 years ago. The disease inci- dence has really shown itself in two distinct and contrasting areas. A southern zone with high rates in Lahore District and Waziristan District, Western Ind. District shared in this increase in prevalence; and a northern zone with low rates, Peshawar District with the lowest rates ever recorded, 33 per 1,000, Rawalpindi District with the remarkable figure of 41 cases and Kohat District with low rates except for cases imported from Multan. The Rawalpindi admissions of the past 4 years are worth noting: 106-84-94-41. In Waziristan there was a heavy outbreak at Razani Camp due to infec- tion from neighbouring uncontrolled villages. In Lahore District including Multan, Ferozepore, Lahore Cantonment and Ambala light scattered showers, high humidity and a late summer which was prolonged well into the late autumn.
22 at a time when troop movements and unusual postings were in progress, were responsible for definite malarial outbreaks. In Delhi Province military personnel have shared in the benefits achieved by the Malaria Institute of India in the anti-malarial improvements which have been made round Delhi and New Delhi. In Eastern Command the excess rains in the U. P. lead to a slight increase in fresh cases limited chiefly to Meerut District although civil reports show there was marked prevalence in Orissa and Bengal. In the South the malarial incidence was rather less than usual in Madras and Deccan Districts, although civil reports indicate an unusual epidemic in Madras Presidency. In Bombay District malaria was widespread and pre- valent in the civil population and military personnel were similarly affected. Admission rates at Mhow and Jubbulpore were also markedly increased. In the Bombay area lack of attention to recognised methods of prevention or lack of discipline were definitely the cause of many admissions; for example at one defensive outpost of 32 men nets were not used for the first 4 days because no means of supporting the nets over the men's beds had been provided, of this group 32 men were eventually admitted for malaria; in another case a surprise visit by the medical officer discovered 11 men in one room and 9 men in another sleeping in a malarious area without their mosquito nets. In Western Ind. District the rate for malaria has risen from the low record of last year, but can still be considered as satisfactory as being half that of practically all previous years. This decline in cases is attributed to the enthu- siastic work of an energetic anti-malarial officer and efficient cantonment and unit malarial squads. The incidence in this District has been as follows:23 TABLE 16. Comparative diagnoses of Malaria by Commands. (Percentages.) Command. Year. B. T. M. T. Q. T. Mixed. Clinical.

M. T. Infections were 14 per 1,000 in both the former and only 3 and 2 per 1,000 in the latter. 8. Sandfly Fever. This unpleasant and debilitating condition has shown a distinct rise both for British and Indian troops, a rise of 6 per 1,000 for the former and of 1.3 per 1,000 for Indian; but the sickness therefrom is still well below the pre-1937 period when spraying was seriously introduced. The cause of this increase has been an epidemic at Agra in the Delhi Brigade Area, where there was a jump of 34 per 1,000, this increase spread to the Lucknow area; a marked increase of nearly 8 per 1,000 in the Rawalpindi District area; an increase in Lahore District chiefly due to 74 cases at Sialkot and Ferozepore during the hot weather and a definite prevalence of the infection in the premonsoon period at Lucknow.

24 At Agra on the 6th September there was an immense downpour, 15 inches of rain within 2 days which did much damage to mud walls. This was followed by an epidemic of sandfly fever with as many as 50 admissions from military personnel in one day. The Delhi Brigade admission rate jumped 34 per 1,000 to 53.5. Energetic measures were adopted including the spraying of buil- dings with insecticide and the epidemic ceased as abruptly as it had begun. In the Lucknow area sandfly fever was very prevalent in the pre-monsoon period and was also noted into P. and A. District. The result of these out breaks was that the sandfly fever admission rate for Eastern Command rose to 35.34 per 1,000. Rawalpindi District: the rate rose 7.71 per 1,000 to 51, the highest figure for at least 10 years. But for Northern Command as a whole the incidence has been low, though slightly increased on 1938, for the third successive year i.e. since spraying campaigns were introduced. The actual admissions have fallen from 1260 in 1931 to 654 in the present year and in Peshawar District, which has been notorious for sandfly fever the admission rate has fallen below 100 per 1,000, viz . 93.29, for the first time. The rate for Landikotal at 107 per 1,000 is satisfactory, but the rate in Peshawar itself is considerably higher at 130.8. This improvement is again attributed to the spraying campaign which even at every 4th day is the most potent protective means we have. At 93 per, 1,000 in Peshawar District the admissions for sandfly fever have fallen from 17 per cent. of the total admissions for all causes in 1938 to 14 per cent. in the present year. TABLE 18.

Western Ind. District, however, in contrast to the previous year shows a decrease of 60 per 1,000 to 54.75 a very much more reasonable figure. It is too soon to shout that our measures are successful but the reduction has been is attributed to: (a) improved housing in the new barracks; (b) destruction and removal of old buildings and rubble; (c) increased efficiency of spraying.
25 When things go well we are inclined to forget the natural reductions which may occur from climatic and other causes and the periodic decrease in the wave of incidence of all diseases. It is interesting to note however that a marked or very marked prevalence of sandflies, Phlebotomus papatassii and others, was recorded in several areas including Western District. Phlebotomus was particularly noted in the hill stations of Rawalpindi District, and at Dalhousie but no truly indigenous cases have occurred, a point worth noting in connection with the conclusion reached in this connection in the Sandfly fever Enquiry Report. The Sandfly fever Enquiry at Peshawar, carried out by an officer of the Royal Army Medical Corps under the auspices of the Director, the King Insti- tute of Preventive Medicine, Guindy, has been brought to a close; the officer concerned having departed on service. A summary of the report is included in paragraph 64 K. 9. Dengue. This disease is one of the conditions which appear to show marked annual Variations. It appears in epidemic form in certain areas and then appears to die away. In the present year we seem to have encountered the epidemic in P. and A. District and in Lucknow District which has materially influenced the all India figures for British troops. TABLE 19. The incidence of Dengue Fever. Ratios per 1,000. Admissions. Year. British.

26 From Table 19 it will be observed that Indian troops do not show the marked variations shown by British. The latter may be specially prone to infection or it may be partly a question of diagnosis. When Dengue is pre- valent there is a tendency to diagnose many obscure mild fevers as such. Whereas at other times uncertain cases are labelled cold, pharyngitis, influenza and so on. The presence of a mild, evanescent rash in a two to four day's fever is much more easy to see on the European than on the Indian skin. In P. and A. District with 288 admissions, it was at Calcutta, where there were 268 cases that the epidemic became most marked. Cases occurred from May to October with 73 admissions in May, but doubt has been expressed by some medical officers as to the correctness of the diagnosis in this small epidemic as in some portions of the period mosquitoes were not remark- ably prevalent. In Lucknow there was a similar but lesser influx of cases, both British and Indian. There was also a small epidemic at Ambala amongst Officers, their families and servants. This was an unusual outbreak and appeared to be limited to certain bungalow areas. At Lahore too there were some typical dengue cases, 6 were admitted there and one Lahore case in Dalhousie. Aedes egypti were common in Lahore at the time, also albopictus and vittatus. Five cases were reported from Karachi and of the 45 cases admitted and diagnosed as such in Southern Command 14 each came from Bombay and Madras. It will be seen therefore that the condition was widespread tending to epidemic proportions in the Bengal delta. 10. Fevers of the Typhus Group. The total sickness from this Group remains much the same as in 1938 viz ., 61 for 1939. British cases have however increased to 30 and Indian decreased to 31, but the total numbers are very small. The total numbers from all ranks and classes was 73 and again the cases fall into two main groups; the typhus of the Hills which occurs in the autumn and the Murine typhus (Protens X 19) of the Plains which gives the bulk of the cases (27 out of 73). The OX 2 group only produced 8 cases and 7 cases were diagnosed as typhus group but unclassified. TABLE 21. Incidence of Typhus Fever. Year. Actuals. British. Indian.

Eastern and Northern Commands both record slight increases. In the latter however Lahore District continued to show the previous year's decrease, the rate now being 2.2 per 1,000 with no deaths. In Peshawar District there was an epidemic in the villages surrounding Nowshera and a number of cases. in the Saddar Bazzar. Northern Command as a whole showed a slight increase. to 1.51 per 1,000 but the total military cases in the Command only numbered 19. The A. D. H. & P. comments to the following effect. Considering the disease was rife in surrounding villages (Nowshera and Abbottabad) we must conclude that inoculation plus water treatment are the cause and our safeguard, and that this is not due to improved sanitation (other than water). The dysentery incidence which is not affected by either of these preventive measures shows no sign of reduction. The fact that during the year nearly 2,000 British troops were in camps in Waziristan together with Indian Troops, Followers and labourers and that no single case of Enteric occurred speaks well for our control in Military areas. The only case in Western District was due for inoculation. The relative proportions of the members of the Enteric Group of diseases is shown by the next table.

But this is only one example out of a number. Protective inoculation.31 12. Dysentery, Diarrh32 CHART NO. VI. DYSENTERY & DIARRHOEA33 The all India figure is really made up of two counter-balancing areas, the North and West, with a decrease of admissions during the year and the East and South which by their greater increases have affected the total rate. In Southern Command there was an increase of 8 per 1,000 and the need for fly proofing of dining rooms and latrines in cantonments is stressed. In Deccan District, with Mhow and Nasirabad as the worst stations the admissions have increased by 4 per 1,000 to the highest for 6 years. Rs. 15,480 have been sanctioned for fly-proofing of latrines in cantonments. In this District to troop movements an increase in infections is attributed, having occurred en route and becoming evident by the admission of a number of cases 4 or 5 days after arrival at the new station. In Eastern Command there has been a steady increase over the past 3 years attributed definitely to insanitary conditions and fly borne infection. In Meerut District the dysentery-diarrh34 The fly borne nature of infection.35 OHART NO.VII. BRITISH TROOPS =36 It was hoped that the Municipal trenching grounds at Jhansi would be moved at the end of the year. No action to this effect has been successful and the Municipal authorities do not appear to be willing to make any improvement in the sanitation of areas under their control. Fly infestation with its high dysenteric consequence will therefore remain unabated. The relative incidence of the whole Dysentery group is of interest also in showing the decline of the amoebic type of infection compared with the fly- borne bacillary type. It will be noted that am37 TABLE 32.

Cholera As an aftermath of 1938 Cholera was wide-spread, reaching epidemic form in the east and centre of India [see paragraph 6 (c )]. In spite of disturbed conditions, in spite of garrisoning security posts in unhealthy isolated areas and in spite of many unusual moves by train and road throughout the year, although there were a number of alarms of cholera in cantonments, there were NO cases amongst British troops in 1939 and only two civilian cases in cantonments, Lucknow Cantonment. 14. Disease of the Digestive System. The admission rate for this group of diseases has again risen appreciably viz. by 10 per 1,000 to the considerable figure of nearly 124 per 1,000. 1936 103.1 per 1,000. 1937 99.4 per 1,000. 1938 113.6 per 1,000. 1939 123.5 per 1,000. This follows closely the rise in the general Dysentery group and as far as the intestinal infections go is dependent on similar causes namely disturbed conditions, much travelling and camping also probably the earlier return from Hill stations. Tonsillitis which is included in this group shows a satisfactory reduction of over 200 cases but is still 3rd on the list of principal diseases. Both catarrhal jaundice and gastritis show appreciable reductions during the year; the former 28 cases less and the latter 80 cases. Pharyngitis however which is one of this group produced a substantial increase of nearly 100 cases. The increase in digestive diseases does not in any way seem to be connected with the increased ration allowance as was feared by one medical specialist in the previous year. An outbreak of intestinal trouble, acute diarrh38 15. Cysticercosis, Epilepsy and the Worm Infections Cysticercosis.39 16. Oriental Sore. There was an increase of 16 cases of cutaneous Leishmaniasis amongst British troops. The relative figures for the past 5 years are shown below. Increase or decrease of Oriental Sore. Year British troops Indian troops 1935 +2 40 however show an increase of 458 admissions with a total nearly up to 11,000 cases. In addition there are the numerous cases retained under Barrack treatment. It is likely that something could be done by close supervision of all cases in their early stages, but the very nature of military training and particularly of any frontier operations tends to produce large numbers of such cases. In Northern Command this group always produces large numbers of ad- missions. In the present year there is a substantial increase of nearly 20 per 1,000 to 135.11 per 1,000. A ten year table shows that the rate rarely drops below 120 per 1,000. The total inefficiency caused by this group is summarised in the following table. TABLE 34.

41 Local injuries, which include sprains, abrasions, contusions and open injuries, taken as a whole accounted for nearly 450 less British admissions than in the previous year. There were 3 more deaths than in 1938 but 10 more than in 1937. Resin Poisoning.42 CHART No.VIII. BRITISH43 TABLE 3644. (iii) The presence of ample facilities and temptations leading to infec- tion, with a lack of social amenities and European companion- ship outside barracks during long years of service is undoubtedly one of the causes. (iv) The new drug treatment is also having an effect. This can be obtained readily from local practitioners at a cost very small compared with the penalties inflicted on the unfortunate man who acquires the disease and presents himself for official treat- ment.

BRITISH TROOPS=47 20. Small pox The protective state acquired by vaccination remains at a satisfactory level. Forgetfulness is still a case of neglect of this simple precaution. Owing to the period of 3 years being the limit of protection after vaccina- tion allowed by Port Health authorities in places out of India an amendment was issued to our own vaccination rules for all troops proceeding abroad. Orders were issued that all officers and troops proceeding abroad must have been protected by vaccination not less than 12 days or more than 3 years at the time of reaching the port of disembarkation.

British Officers. 99.81 99.52 British Other Ranks. 99.91 99.28 Women and Children 99.70 97.32 There was a reduction of 6 cases of smallpox compared with the previous year. British other ranks produced cases at Delhi, Meerut, Cawnpore and Sialkot but there were no deaths. There were no cases amongst British Offi- cers and their families and there was only one case in B. O. Rs.' wives at Meerut. This is all the more remarkable in view of the marked prevalence of small- pox in many areas of the country [see paragraph 6 (b )]. For example at Ambala there was a small epidemic in the Railway colony, 67 cases and 11 deaths, but there were no British cases in the station. 21. Cerebrospinal Fever. There were only 3 cases, one of which died at Meerut, the recovery cases were at Razmak and Jubbulpore. Special attention was directed to the likelihood of cases occurring when the Relative Humidity was rising. Little such correlation was observed but climatic changes are often very localised and perhaps not accurately recorded. From previous experience there is an obvious correlation. There was an increase of 9 cases amongst Indian troops, the majority in Northern Command. 22. Poliomyelitis. With only 3 cases this infection does really very little damage even in our susceptible populations. In 1938 there were 6 cases. It is the dramatic onset and high mortality which draws public attention to this disease. Amongst Indian troops there were 2 cases in lieu of none of the previous year. The British cases were at Rawalpindi and Peshawar in June and Lucknow in September; the Indian cases were at Poona and Quetta in July and August.
48 Owing to the fame which has been achieved by the use of the "Iron Lung" much attention has been directed to this condition although it is relatively unimportant. For comments on the " Iron Lung " see paragraph 66 (viii). 23. Respiratory Diseases. The slight increase in the rate per 1,000 of the past 5 years has been main- tained giving a steady rise during these years for all three types of the main respiratory group. Whereas Indian troops have shown an almost similar decrease. The British increase has been more apparent than real in that there has been a reduction of nearly 50 actual admissions. With a decrease in Northern and Eastern Commands the slight general rise is due to increases in Southern Command. There have been no epidemics to account for this except for very localised outbreaks labelled " Influenza " in Southern Command. There were 111 cases of Influenza admitted, but a note is made to the effect that nearly all are from seaport towns at a time when Dengue was prevalent. In Madras District there were 34 admissions for Influenza immediately after the arrival of a fresh British Battalion and finally there were 46 cases from British troops and 11 from Indian troops. The influence of the Sulphapyridine group of drugs in the treatment of these cases has been commented on as being one of the outstanding features of success. TABLE 40. Respiratory Diseases by types.

There was, however, an increase of 61 cases of pneumonia compared with the preceding year but the deaths were only 5 compared with 10 of the previous year. This definite increase in pneumonia is due to admissions in Southern and Northern Commands. In Eastern Command there was a definite decrease in the disease, noted as being one of the few bright spots of the annual résumé; but in Southern there were 30 cases with no deaths and in Northern there was a sharp but not extensive increase. It is interesting to note that in Waziristan, where British troops were either in Razmak, at 7,000 feet, or in camp at Razani at 5,000 feet the pneumonic rate was the lowest in the Command at only 1.10 per 1,000.
49 Lobular Pneumonia and Pleuresy with 91 cases between them remained at the usual figure. Bronchitis gave us 87 cases less than in 1938 and there were NO cases of Empyema. The monthly admissions for the pneumonic group are shown below. TABLE 41. Monthly incidence of Pneumonic Group50 25. Diphtheria. There has been a continued increase in this disease to 64 amongst British personnel making a continued rise over the past 3 years, a marked contrast to the cases amongst Indian troops which have again, only 2 admissions for the year.

The general incidence is best shown by the following table:51 26. Effects of Heat. There has been a satisfactory reduction in cases and even better reduction in deaths which are usually high in this group. The slight increase in Heat Exhaustion in recent years is partly due to the greater tendency to diagnose this condition in mild cases of general malaise in the hot weather months. This absence of any marked increase in the Effects of Heat for British personnel is all the more satisfactory in that the whole of the hot weather months saw frequent moves of troops by rail and road, the manning of unusual defence posts and a premature return of British troops from Hill stations to the Plains.

There was however a decrease in Heat Stroke, 5 cases with 1 death. In Southern there were only 2 cases all told with 1 death in Bombay. In Northern Command the rate reduced to 3.1 per 1,000 but the 1938-39 period is well above normal. This was due to 10 cases in Rawalpindi which included one elderly Warrant Officer, the only serious case, who was taken off the train in a collapsed state. Deaths this year have been exceptionally low, 1 out of 39 cases or 2.7 compared to 14.29 per 1,000 of 1938. The value of increased salt intake which was stressed in our 1938 report was shown at Cawnpore where the hot weather was long and trying with record temperatures but a low relative humidity. The value of increased salt consumption in the prevention of heat-stroke was stressed. Only one case of Heat Exhaustion was.admitted. There were other cases with slight tempe- ratures but they were not dealt with as cases of " Heat ". In a large station in Peshawar District a patient for Gonorrhoea developed heat-stroke in hospital and died rapidly. He was shown to be a chronic alcoholic (8 pints of beer and much whisky daily) with typical alcoholic stomach and liver. His heart showed the typical wooden heart of heat-stroke.

52 27. Mental Diseases. For British Troops the steady decrease of recent years has been continued, the numbers admitted being the least shown for the past 6 years. Invaliding although showing a reduction of 9 cases is still over 50 for the year. Nearly 30 per cent. of the admissions were for Hysteria and of these only 9 were invalided. TABLE 47.

Steps were taken at Home to rectify this matter. A group of 8 men who were noted from Southern Command to weigh under 112 lbs. on enlistment were placed on special reports; a follow-up showed that they have now gained satisfactorily in weight.

Deaths. The death rate at 2.75 per 1,000 shows a slight decrease on the previous year and the death rates over the quinquennial periods since the War 1914-18 show a steady decline to 2.54 per 1,000. In Southern Command there were only 17 deaths compared with 29 of 1938 and this is first time for many years that the death rate has fallen below 2 per 1,000. There were two unusual deaths, a B. O. R. who was mauled by a tiger near Deolali and another who was killed in shallow water by a shark at Madras. One British soldier is considered to have died of Heat Stroke at Mount Abu but the cause of death was uncertain as he died alone when lost from his walking party in the hills. In Waziristan the deaths increased to 19 but 15 of these were due to gun shot wounds. The principal causes of death were: Per 1,000. Local injuries including G. S.

As noted in paragraph 2, the admission rates for Officers has increased for the last 3 years and stands at 435.1 per 1,000. This increase is due to rising admissions in Northern and Eastern Commands, Western Independent District and Southern Command showing definitely decreased rates. In Northern Command there has been a jump of 90 to the year's rate of 497.01 per 1,000. This actually is about normal for the Command except in the " low " years 1937, 1938. This is due chiefly to Lahore District where the rate increased to 521 per 1,000 due to similar causes as for the Troops. The death rate has, however, decreased and, at 1 only, is lowest for 8 years. Kohat District is noteworthy in having an exceptionally low sick rate at 375 per 1,000 in spite of the long trying hot weather which was experienced there.
55 Eastern Command, though less in actuals, shows some increase in the admission rate. There was considerable Dysentery in Meerut, and Dengue and Sandfly fever in Lucknow District. There were 3 deaths in young officers including two young R. A. M. C. officers, one of poliomyelitis and one of tuber- culosis. Southern Command shows a reduction in sickness, 6 per 1,000 and no deaths. Dysentery at 52 per 1,000 was the most prominent feature and also minor septic diseases. Western Independent District too showed a marked drop in admissions, the actuals being halved and the rate reduced by 200 per 1,000. There were no invalids and no deaths. The D. A. D. H. remarks: "It is undoubtedly a fact that Officers particularly are paying more attention to protecting themselves and their men from malaria, sandflies and the pollution of food by flies." The principal causes of sickness amongst Officers were as follows:57 PART I SECTION II ON THE HEALTH OF INDIAN ARMY.
58 SECTION II ON THE HEALTH OF INDIAN ARMY 33. General The health of the Indian Army has on the whole been satisfactory. There have been no pidemics of any note and such increase as there has been, viz ., 32.2 per 1,000 in admission rates an be fully accounted for by conditions of war service. Large numbers of eservists returned to their units, there was a consid- erable influx of recruits and many defensive posts had to be manned in re- latively unhealthy areas. Death rates have decreased to 2.12 per 1,000 and invaliding has increased to 6.43 per 1,000. The average constantly sick figure has increased to 16.25.

Officers The admission rates for officers which has shown a steady upward tendency for the past 10 years is this year again conspicuous for a rise of nearly 80 per 1,000 but is still below the quinquennial figure for 1925-29 but the rates for invaliding at 12.36 per 1,000 and for deaths at 3.84 per 1,000 have decreased. The increase in admission rates is due partly to the return to India of a number of retired and in many cases elderly officers after the outbreak of war and partly to the arrival of a number of very junior officers without experience of life in East. The principal causes of sickness were as follows:60 CHART No. X. Ratios per 1,000 Admitted to Hospital, Invalids, Constantly sick, and average sick time to each soldier from 1921 to 1939.

61 Of the total deaths 4 were due to injuries, a cause which as usual heads the list of causes of deaths. Of the remaining, deaths due to sickness the diseases were: Haemorrhagic meningeal effusion, Aneurysm, Bronchitis, Nephritis and Carcinoma, each 1 case. 35. Soldiers There has been a marked rise in admission rates, nearly 33 per 1,000 to 454.0, a rate higher than any shown by the past quinquennial periods. This increase is due in greater part to four main preventable diseases, viz ., malaria, dysentery, scabies and sandfly fever. In all of these diseases and in many others shown in the table below any relaxation of disciplinary control and laxity in the recognised measures of prevention will produce an increased number of cases. This has been in part, the cause of this year's increase and is due to the disturbing influence of the onset of war, unusual journeys, overcrowding in barracks, manning of defensive posts scattered throughout unhealthy areas away from the protection of cantonment life, increased training and other activities. But is also due to the importation of infected personnel in the form of Reservists called up from their villages, numbers of recruits infected before acceptance and auxiliary troops arriving from civilian life. The principal causes of admissions to hospital were:62 TABLE 5563 The main diseases for which invaliding was necessary are shown below.

Venereal diseases. 0.04 .. 0.01 It will be noted that once again Tuberculosis heads the list, pulmonary tuberculosis accounting for nearly 200 of the cases and the total tubercular diseases again form nearly 1/3 of the total cases invalided. The average number of constantly sick in hospital was 16.25 per 1,000 of the strength compared with 15.78 in 1938 and 15.15 in 1937. The average sick time to each soldier was 5.93 days and the average duration of each case was 13.06 days compared with 5.76 days and 13.65 days of 1938. Men under barrack treatment (out patients) were 1,296.5 per 1,000 com- pared with 1,229.9, 1,219.1 and 1,343.3 of 1938, 1937 and 1936, respectively. The combined ratio of constantly sick in hospital plus those constantly under treatment in barracks was 34.60 per 1,000 compared with 33.22 in 1938, 33.00 in 1937 and 34.93 in 1936. This represents the total loss per 1,000 pe day. These statistics show that the health of the Indian Army has on the whole been reasonably satisfactory throughout the year although the admission rate of 454.0 per 1,000 is in excess by 32.2 over that of last year. All Commands show an increase in sick rates with Malaria and Sandfly fever being the chief causes. In W. I. District there was an increase of 60 per 1,000 due to malaria and sandfly fever. In Eastern Command the sick rate, though not so adversely affected as in the case of British Troops, at 455.3 per 1,000 gives the highest rate for 6 years, sandfly fever, malaria and dengue being the causes. Southern Command too has produced increases due in the main to malaria of which there were 2,416 admissions compared with 1,609 of the previous year. There was a good deal of overcrowding in Bombay at one period. In Northern Command, where there was a general increase of 19 per 1,000, a curious feature was the contrast between Lahore and Waziristan districts with higher rates and the other three districts, Kohat, Peshawar and Rawal- pindi districts with the lowest sick rates ever recorded. The general decrease
64 in malaria and sandfly fever was partly offset by increases in mumps, pharyn- gitis and ankylostomiasis. In Waziristan district in spite of operations in the Shaktu Valley in February and March with cold, rain and snow and pro- longed columns the general health has remained good. Kohat district with a reduction of 75 per 1,000 in sickness has the healthiest year for 4 years. In Peshawar district with still further reductions the admission rate at 353 per 1,000 is the lowest for at least 15 years; there were only 19 cases of malaria, 1 of sandfly fever and 1 of venereal diseases per 1,000 of strength. In this district the progressive fall in insect borne diseases is of interest. 1934. 1935. 1936. 1937. 1938. 1939. Insect borne disease group 50.6 39.6 47.9 30.0 30.1 25.6 per cent of the total admissions. From Rawalpindi district the following observations are recorded. From the 1st September onward all the factors which tend to increase sick rates were operative, reservists were called up in large numbers, recruits arrived in batches, Territorial battalions were raised and leave men were recalled from and through malarious areas. The sanitary discipline of these was naturally not so good as it is in the trained troops. Men were undergoing intensive training, there was some overcrowding and many outposts and secu- rity points were manned. In spite of all these factors the sick rate was lower this year compared with 1938 and would have been better still but for these abnormal activities after war was declared. Barrack treatment and high rates of sick. The remark is noted from reports that of all the factors given to account for high sick rates in barracks, the personality of the medical officer is one of the most important. Frequent changes of medical officer, the presence of newly joined, ignorant medical officers and soft hearted elderly medical officers are all conducive to specially high sick-rates in the medical inspection rooms.

68 36. Followers. Admission rates for followers at 323.2 per 1,000 show an increase of 51.2 over 1938. The death rate has been 2.50 and invaliding rate 4.23 per 1,000. The following table shows the sickness rates for followers during the past 5 years. Sick rates for followers are usually on a much lower level than for troops partly because they are less likely to report sick as long as they can carry on with their work. TABLE 59.

Principal interesting features of the Year. (See paragraph 5.) (a) The declaration of War and the preparation and despatch of over- seas troops and replacement of units was the outstanding feature of the year. Subsequently there was much movement of troops; Territorial Forces were embodied; protective posts over widely scattered and often unhealthy areas were manned; Reservists and returning leave men arrived in large numbers from malarial infected areas and Recruiting Centres were flooded with eager applicants. (b) Tetanus Toxoid immunisation was carried out for. Indian Troops of overseas forces and has been arranged now for the whole Army in India. (c) Operations were carried out in the Shaktu Valley in Waziristan, at Cuttack in Orissa in the east and at Sukkur in Sind in the west. The health of troops remained remarkably good. (d) Hospitals had to be expanded in certain stations to meet require- ments of increased garrisons. (e) Drought conditions prevailed in Rajputana and the Eastern Punjab. The garrison of Nasirabad had to be reduced because of water shortage. (f) In P. & A. and Meerut Districts there were increased sick rates in all the six principal diseases: Malaria, sandfly fever, dysentery, venereal disease, influenza and minor septic diseases but in contrast Rawalpindi district showed decreases in malaria, minor septic diseases, sandfly fever, scabies and venereal diseases. 38.Factors which have affected the incidence of disease amongst troops. (a) The changed distributions of troops due to the War; the manning of defensive posts in out-of-the-way and often unhealthy areas; the frequent moves; the crowding of barracks and quarters with recalled leave men, with reservists and with recruits many of whom must have been heavily infected with malaria and other communicable diseases were important factors. (b) There was a prevalence of cholera in the East and Central India; plague in the South; small-pox round Abbottabad, Lahore, Ambala and Meerut; Malaria in the U. P. and the Bombay area. (c) An excess rainfall in the Agra-Lucknow area on the 6th September, 11.26 inches in one day, which caused much destruction in the former, pro- duced an epidemic of sandfly fever. (d) Anti-insecticide spraying has been considerably developed and arrange- ments were made for manufacture of the pyrethrum spraying solutions from Kenya grown flowers prepared in the Military Medical Store Depots. (e) Active operations in the Shaktu Valley in February and March with cold, rain and snow; ' Civil disturbance ' forces in Orissa at Cuttack and at Sukkur in Sind. In all the health of the troops remained remarkably good. (f) Estforce.70 Measures for the preservation of the health of the troops had to be exten- sive and these would appear to have been well carried out because the inci- dence of sickness under these adverse conditions was satisfactory. During the period the following were the principal admissions for Indian Troops:71 The incidence of the various types of malaria by Commands is shown below. TABLE 61.

This increase however was not great except in parts of Southern Command and in most instances did not exceed the rates of the normal years. In Western Independent District there was an increase of 24 per 1,000 but the rate is 59 per 1,000 less than any preceding year except that of the exceptional 1938. Civilian figures on the other hand show an increase of 30 per cent. The incidence was late into the autumn, viz ., to the end of Novem- ber in Chaman, due to high humidity and temperature and to returning leave parties. Karachi showed a remarkable fall in figures; the distinction made here between " Fresh " and " Relapse " cases as given is illuminating. F
72 Karachi Fresh. Relapse. B. T. cases 5 23 M. T. cases 4 8 Clinical 3 21 Total 12 52 or a relapse rate of 81 per cent. One can only comment from these results that either the figures are entirely fallacious or the methods of treatment are extremely inefficient. It was owing to the obvious inaccuracies in distinction between " Fresh " and " Relapse " cases amongst Indian troops from very many stations that it was decided to abandon this distinction for Indian troops. The distinction was inaccurate, grossly misleading and used as a cloak of self complacency by officers who showed that all cases in their station were " Relapse " cases from elsewhere and that there was no malarial infection present in their's. From the end of 1939 malaria for Indian troops will be recorded as " total " malaria. In Eastern Command there was an increase of 373 actual fresh infections. It was estimated that 60 per cent of all Indian troops' malaria was acquired out of cantonments. A definite decrease in Jhansi was surprising at first sight, but was accounted for by troop movements. Meerut and Dehra Dun were particularly affected by imported malaria and infections on outpost duties on Bridges. In Southern Command the increase was due to malaria in Bombay, Saugor and Jubbulpore; in all there was quite an epidemic of infections. In Bombay there were 10 cases of Quartan fever. The majority of cases were from small defensive posts scattered in unhealthy areas in the autumn. Difficulties were experienced in net-suspension because in barracks net-wires are provided and poles were not available or were not used. It is essential that proper means of suspension for mosquito nets should be provided wherever space permits. Steps are being taken to secure this provision for the future. In Northern Command Malaria continues to produce double the admis- sions of any other disease, but in this year it has actually decreased 9 per 1,000 and gave the best year for 11 years. There is however no marked tendency to progressive fall as for the British over the past 15 years, this being due to recruits arriving infected, chronic cases with tolerance living in the lines, bazaar life and infection while on leave. For all such cases the use of the full therapeutic course is decidedly the most effective method for stopping ad- missions and draining the reservoir. Spraying campaigns are said to have produced most satisfactory results at Sialkot, Dharamsala, Bakloh, Jhelum, Rawalpindi, Nowshera and Peshawar. At Jhelum special attention was paid to freeing from infection families living in the lines. The very low incidence of malaria amongst the men is attributed to this. In Waziristan District there are two remarkable contrasts. Mir Ali with an admission rate of 230 per 1,000 due to cases at the groups of piquet- in the Shinki defile which are surrounded by areas over which anti-malarial control cannot be maintained and Wana at which the admission rate is 83 per 1,000 and is lower even than the remarkable result of 1938. At Wana and Damdil an extensive trial of prophylactic Atebrin was undertaken during the uatumn73 The progressive fall in Peshawar District is also worth noting. 137.82 163.34 94.98 97.14 78.07 In this district mosquito proofing is provided at Chakdara but the proof- ed rooms are too hot to use. In all reports it is noted that the best results are invariably obtained and the greatest freedom from malaria achieved in those places and in those units in which the greatest attention is paid to the details of prevention. Wherever there is personal interest by the commanding officer and by company and platoon commanders in the supervision of nets, use of cream, in regular and painstaking spraying and in lectures and talks, there the malarial incidence is relatively least. Where such interest is lacking preventive measures are neglected. For example an A. T. Company returned from the Frontier heavily infected and was housed in a large station next to another A. T. Company. When a flood of infections were noted in the latter it was discovered that nets were not being properly used by either company and no active anti- malarial measures were being carried out. In Western Independent District the localisation of malarial cases is interesting. Quetta. Travel. Camp 47 miles Camp away. Khauozai 46 miles away. 41 1 23 15 40. Sandfly Fever. With the admissions for this disease now at over 700 for the whole of India there has been a break in the recent downward trend. The all-India annual incidence is shown in the following table:74 It is observed that the reduction has been in the Northern Command, particularly in Rawalpindi District, and the Command figures over 10 years are again worth quoting. TABLE 65. Sandfly fever in Northern Command. 1929 36.04 per 1,000. 1930 21.54 1931 27.46 1932 27.56 Spraying and fumigation as an anti-malarial measure in cer- tain stations. 1933 16.53 1934 14.85 1935 18.83 1936 18.43 Spraying campaign intensified as an anti-sandfly and anti-mos- quito measure. 1937 10.65 1938 7.10 1939 7.80 The figures for Landikotal, that hot bed of sandfly fever, are perhaps even more remarkable.

Alipore 39.6 Bangalore 10.2 29.5 P. & A. District and Madras District were the areas affected this year. In the former, of 47 cases 34 cases occurred at Alipore at the time when there were 268 cases amongst British troops for the disease. In Southern Command there were no cases either in Bombay or at St. Thomas Mount, Madras; a fact remarkable enough to deserve mention. Of 81 cases in Madras District 78 were from Bangalore. Here mosquitoes of all kinds were prevalent and Dengue increased a pace. Indian troops had 78 cases compared to 25 of the previous year and British 8 compared with 3 of 1938. 42. Fevers of the Typhus Group. There were 42 cases amongst Indian troops compared with 38, 43, 48, 45 and 51 of the previous years. The details have been considered in paragraph 10 of Section I. 43. Enteric Group of fevers. The comparison of these diseases has been considered under paragraph 11, Section I. The decline in incidence has been maintained for Indian troops, the admissions rate being 0.5 this year. TABLE 68. Case incidence of Enteric Group fevers . Ratio per 1,000. 1934 1.9 1935 1.4 1936 0.7 1937 0.9 1938 0.8 1939 0.5 This steady decrease in case incidence for Indian troops who must often quite definitely be subject to the possibilities of severe or mass infection is indeed most satisfactory, and is one of our outstanding successes in preventive medicine.
76 A perusal of the Preliminary Report of the Public Health Commissioner for 1939 shows how widespread and intense are Enteric Group infections in the civil population; thus: In the N.-W. F. Province, especially in the larger towns, enteric fever was prevalent and the death rate was nearly doubled in Peshawar: in Bengal there was a marked increase in urban and rural areas in the C. P. there were 1,285 recorded deaths and the Commissioner reports that the incidence of this disease is considerably higher than recorded mortality figures would indicate: in Bombay the epidemic of 1938 continued in less severe form into 1939: in Madras Presi- dency the disease was widespread and prevalent throughout the year and in Assam enteric continued in all parts of the province with a sharp epidemic in one area. It is therefore obvious that we have a civilian population riddled with Enteric group infection and yet living in their midst is our military personnel composed of the same classes and types who only have one man in 2,000 even infected during the year. The greater part of this success is unquestionably due to our standard of protective immunisation by T. A. B. inoculation. The percentage of all ranks protected is as follows:77 TABLE 70. Dysentery, Diarrh78 decrease has no evidence of real reduction from a normal figure of 20 to 24 per 1,000. In every area it is stressed that this is a fly-borne disease, occurring subse- quent to any prevalence of flies and due to carriage of infection from insanitary, infected ground and latrines to unprotected feeding places and dining rooms. The monthly figures and the known facts of insanitary surroundings and nume- rous cases, acute and chronic, in surrounding populations clearly show the correlation between the carrying house fly and the infection of our troops. Comments on and illustrations of this have been made from Bombay, Kohat, Peshawar, Rawalpindi, Quetta and Lucknow. Even from Egypt from Indian units stationed there comment has been received on a marked prevalence of dysentery and diarrh9 Abbottabad.80 49. The Minor Septic and Local injuries Group of diseases. This prolific combined group produced nearly 16,000 admissions in the year for British and Indian troops, and the man-days lost comes to nearly 220,000 days. TABLE 74.

Rs., and Followers were invalided. The admission and invaliding rates for Indian Officers and Indian Other Ranks and for Followers for the past 5 years has been as follows:84 These figure include pulmonary and non-pulmonary tuberculosis amongst Officers and all ranks and followers. It will be observed that during the past 8 years the numbers for the Indian Army have tended to remain stable with an inclination to decrease. As a slight guide to the tendency in the civil population the tuberculosis noted at recruiting centres amongst the recruitable population may be of future use. TABLE82.

The percentage of recruits accepted at the recruiting centres in the year ending the 31st March 1940 was 54.6 compared with 56.5 per cent. of the previous year, rejections being 45.4 per cent. The principal causes of rejection of recruits for this year has been as follows. TABLE 87. Causes of rejection of recruits87 In the Report for 1938 the number of recruits rejécted for Trachoma received some comment in view of the attention drawn to this by the District Soldiers' Board in the Delhi Recruiting Area. The numbers rejected for Trachoma at the main recruiting centres during 1939 were as follows compared to the two previous years. TABLE 88 Stations. Quarter ending 1937 1938 1939 Mar. June. Septr.

In 1938 the number was less, but still more than 7 times the figure of 1936. It will be noted from the figures for 1939-40 that rejections at Delhi show a further decrease, actual and relative in the two halves of the year. There is a very marked jump in numbers rejected for this condition during the last quarter of the year at Rawalpindi, Lahore and Jullundur; possibly due to previous rejects trying again. MILITARY COLLEGES AND SCHOOLS. Royal Indian Military College, Dehra Dun. The health of the cadets has been very good with no serious illness. Mumps was introduced at the beginning of the autumn term but the infection faded out. Coryza, malaria, a few cases of dysentery and a chronic cystitis suspected of being tubercular comprised the medical cases and knee injuries, fractures and 3 cases of otitis media formed the surgical cases. A multiple fracture of the epicondyle of the humerus was the only unsuccessful surgical case. King George's Royal Indian Military Schools. Ajmer.88 The Ghi issue was reduced to that required for cooking only. The saving thus obtained was expended in providing a daily packet of one ounce of fresh butter from the Government Military dairy to every boy. At first received with doubt this issue subsequently became very popular. 60. Invaliding There has been a definite rise in the invaliding rate during the year. This. might well be expected in a year affected by the onset of war, but the amount of the rise from a very steady rate of many previous years indicates that in the case of reservists and many employed men medical examination for fitness or unfitness in peace time may be too lax or lenient. At the outbreak of war. with prospects of service overseas it became obvious that many an elderly reservist or follower was not fit for general service. This is a point to which strict attention is desirable in the future. Invaliding Ratio per 1,000 1935 5.54 1936 5.52 1937 5.49 1938 5.83 1939 6.43 The principal causes of invaliding are shown in paragraph 35, Table 4 of Section II. Special Cases. 89 62.Officers Special diseases and remarks The admission rates for Officers has increased by 75 per 1,000 to 462.1 a figure which is in excess of any for the past 10 years but is not as great as the average for the quinquennium 1925-29. Digestive diseases, injuries and malaria as in previous years form the three principal causes of sickness, the first shows an increase of 27 per 1,000 but malaria has slightly decreased. Invaliding. at 12.36 per 1,000 has returned to a more normal figure com- patible with the past 10 years and deaths at 3.84 show the lowest figure for many years. (See paragraph 33, Tables 53-A and B and paragraph 34.) In Northern Command there is an increase in admission rates, the rate is about normal, but deaths have satisfactorily decreased for British and Indian officers. In the latter there were none, and in the former 2 out of 3 were due to gunshot-wounds. In Rawalpindi District 187 per 1,000 of the 710.38 per 1,000 were due to digestive diseases and minor septic groups. Pesha- war District showed a marked reduction in malaria and sandfly fever. In Waziristan at Bannu there was one case of enteric fever, the classical case of an officer who did not wish to be inoculated and acquired the infection on a train journey. In Southern Command the disease rates were higher than in the previous year, but there were no deaths from disease. Two of the notified deaths were from mawling by tigers. 63. Followers The admission rate at 323.2 per 1,000 is considerably more than that of 1938 and higher than any year for 10 years, except that for the unhealthy year of 1933. The principal diseases of Followers with their annual variations are shown. below. TABLE 89. Admission for followers.90 TABLE 90.

94 SECTION III. SPECIAL SUBJECTS. 64. Hygiene A. Accommodation (i ) The standard of accommodation in barracks and quarters of British and Indian troops has continued to progress. Modern barracks both for British and Indian troops are definitely good and show attention to those details which improve the health of the occupants. The modern type of married quarter, both British and Indian, is also definitely good with modern sanitation available in the British type. But during inspections it is noted and comment is often made that many barracks, many cookhouses or feeding places and many quarters are much below modern standards. This applies perhaps more particularly to the family lines of Indian troops and followers and the family quarters of British troops in hill stations. It is however a question of money and of relative needs in a district or command, and those who constantly urge new lines here or new quarters there should realise that relative needs must be judged. (ii ) Overcrowding .95 (iv ) Whitewashing of buildings. 96 Lucknow and Jhansi are already extensively provided with permanent drain- age, in others where pukka drainage is lacking it is a moot point whether such drainage really has any bearing on the incidence of malaria. (ii ) Mosquito destruction in occupied premises is of paramount importance and for this the development of spraying with insecticide is proving of the greatest value. In many places it is the method of choice and the only practi- cable method. The method has the great advantage that it deals with mos- quitoes, sandflies, flies, fleas and bugs, and that it can be applied to existence in barracks, camps, quarters or in the field. (iii ) Personal protection is the final main standby. Protection with the mosquito net is held by some eminent malariologists to be capable of prevent- ing 95 per cent. of all infections. Unfortunately there are times when the standard pattern net cannot be used or even any net at all and in addition we have not yet succeeded in providing net protection for Followers who form a large part of our military population. Every possible method is utilised in some station or other during the year; but in this report only those which have been specially in evidence during this year will be mentioned. But in assessing the value of any particular method factors such as the following have to be borne in mind. A spleen census of school children carried out by the Health Department of the Punjab since 1914 shows that for the past 3 years malaria in that area has been abnormally low and that any decrease in cases in a cantonment is not necessarily due to the excellence of the anti-malarial work. (a ) Elimination of the "carrier" mosquito (i ) Anti-larval methods and prevention of breeding. Permanent works and drainage. 97 Larvicidal Fish. 98 It was found that men working with lethane sprays suffered from acute irritation of conjuctivæ, of mucous membranes and of the hands. Though apparently harmless the irritation does definitely occur. Experiments have shown that ½ oz. of 1 in 75 Liq. Extract of Pyrethrum or 1 in 33 Lethane freshly prepared in 3rd quality kerosene was required for each 1,000 c.ft. of space for killing all mosquitoes. It was also shown that the carbon tetrachloride, petrol and even citronella could be deleted from our original mixture. In all stations definite spraying programmes are carried through for barracks, quarters, offices, followers-quarters and even trains. The demand is great and entails heavy work by the anti-malarial and unit squads, but so obvious are the results that units willingly co-operate. The ordinary hand spray-gun and various types of portable sprayer have been employed. A new robust hand sprayer devised by the Malaria Institute of India has been manufactured, but has not yet reached complete success. Six Phantomyst machines were purchased for various stations and reports on their use through a season have been received. The reports indicate that when they are working they are good; but they are under-engined and mecha- nically defective and therefore usually not working. For large, closely group- ed barracks they are useful; but they are not really suited to our universal needs. Oily plate .99 Arrangements have now been made for issue of filled cream containers on a 25 per. cent basis for all troops and of the cream itself on an as-required scale to all military personnel and their families, to troops on the move, to families travelling, to touring officers and to all personnel proceeding on leave. Con- tainers may be purchased full of cream at 3 annas each by all military person- nel not entitled to the free issue. (c )Removal of reservoirs of infection. "Prophylactic treatments ." (i )Treatment of new arrivals, returning leave men, called up reservists, etc., forms a method which has been successfully employed. This method is of use on two counts in that potential malarial patients are forestalled by a full course of treatment and secondly chronic infective foci are removed from the lines before they can pass on their parasites to the local mosquitoes and to their fellow men. A full treatment is much more satisfactory than a half- hearted truncated course. The following observations by an experienced officer on the subject of malarial infection and enlarged spleens is worth recording from a Frontier station. 1. Moderately enlarged spleens disappear in the cold weather, reappear- ing in ever increasing numbers from March onwards. The appearance of en- larged spleens from apparently nowhere and at a time when there are no mos- quitoes was a disconcerting feature. 2. If untreated, these spleens increase in size, fluctuating from time to time. 3. Enlarged spleens retreat under treatment only to reappear again on discontinuing treatment. 4. Marked fluctuations in size occur frequently under treatment so much so that I suspected my palpating hand in the earlier days. 5. I frequently picked out men at Medical inspections who had fever with parasites in their blood. These men stated that they had no complaints and felt well. Hence it would appear that the number of admissions to hospital may not truly represent the malarial state of a garrison. It may also explain why one comes across enlarged spleens with no previous history of an attack. I am inclined to believe that for each admission to hospital there is at least one "sub-clinical" case in the lines. (ii ) The treatment of Followers and particularly of women and children at Welfare Centres and Indian troops family hospitals has also been noted as having a definite anti-malarial effect. Unfortunately we have not yet been able to provide Followers with net protection though trials of a less expensive net for this purpose are under way. An indication of the relative safety of cantonments is given by the follow- ing Spleen Index figures taken in an area of average endimicity. Percentage enlarged spleens. Indian children in cantonments 7.8 Indian children in villages just outside cantonments 29.0 Indian children in surrounding districts 45.0
100 (iii ) In co-operation with the civil authorities some progress has been made in a few places, but the ever present fear that co-operation will entail expenditure from local civil funds is usually the stumbling block to achieve- ment. (iv ) Prophylactic treatment. 101 Co-operation between Military Hygiene Officers and Civil Health autho- rities has been sought by a memorandum issued by the Central Advisory Health Board at a meeting held in Madras. Lists of names and appointments were circulated to indicate the corresponding officers between whom liaison should be established. It has been chiefly left to the Military health officers to ini- tiate any co-operation which has been achieved. Comment is made by our hygienists that in practically all cases the scheme is due solely to military initiative, still depends on military drive and owes nothing to civilian energy. In Northern Command 15 fully orga- nised co-operation committees are now in being; but the main barrier to real progress is the unwillingness to provide money for obviously necessary schemes. Military Medical Embarkation Officers at Madras, Bombay, Calcutta and Karachi have been appointed to perform ex officio the duties of Port, Health Officer in respect of all troop ships. D. Dairies. In the Government Military Dairies Service we have an institution which is steadily improving, which yearly proves more and more valuable to the Army in India and which is responsible in no small measure for the improve- ment in health in military cantonments. A very high standard of hygiene is maintained which contrasts well with other uncontrolled supplies which unfortunately the power of vested interests can still maintain in various cantonments. In many stations all the Indian units now take their supply of milk from the Military Dairy. British families also are becoming more sensible in this respect though the temptation of credit and lower prices of the local gwalla is often great. Excellent new dairies have been completed at Lahore, Sialkot, Peshawar, Meerut, Wana, Jubbulpore, etc., and are in building or under improvement at other places. For stations where dairies do not exist depots provide the supply, such as at Bareilly, Abbottabad, and Bombay, with good results. In Southern and Eastern Command small pasteurisers are provided in a majority of the dairies to deal only with small quantities of milk. Large pasteurisers to deal with the whole output have not been installed. The policy of putting such large pasteurisers is now being steadily pursued as funds be- come available, but the cost is very high and has been more than doubled since the onset of war. Provision will therefore be only gradual. Other dairies. 102 for provision of a suitable training area in each brigade station and for the use of these as part of the general training of units and for their maintenance from training-grant funds. Demonstration areas are already being established at a number of stations: Lucknow, Karachi, Jhelum, Sialkot, Peshawar, Jubbulpore and so on. In addition in each Command pamphlets of instruc- tion have been revised and issued to all medical officers. To reach its proper place in the training of all personnel training in field hygiene must be treated as a part of the normal training programme of the year. It is hoped that by the means mentioned above satisfactory results will now be obtained. Rest camps and training camps are often the obvious source of infection and admission to hospital of quite large numbers of men. Special attention has been directed to the use of all available preventive measures in such camps as a means of conserving man-power and preventing waste. F. Food and its control. This has been receiving special attention during the year particularly since the commencement of war which has called for large demands from un- usual sources and new types of materials or foodstuffs. The routine inspection of food supplies and of issues has been very thorough and a most excellent supervisory control is maintained through the Director of Contracts, Director of Supplies and the Military Food Laboratory, Kasauli. Few people, other than those intimately concerned, realise what a valu- able part this Food Laboratory plays in the maintenance of our high standard of foodstuffs for the Army. A summarised report of the work done through the year is given below and conveys some idea of the scope of the work covered. This work includes the control of ghi supplies which are prepared at the Ghi Heating Centre at Agra. Throughout the year and particularly in the last 4 months after the onset of war this laboratory under able and highly skilled personnel has examined and checked samples of supplies of all kinds. At times the checking may appear to be severe, but there is no doubt that the slightest relaxation of control or standards means immediate deterioration of quality. (i) The Military Food Laboratory, Kasauli. Summary of work carried out during 1939. (a) There has again been an increase in the work done during the year, a record total of 20,328 samples having been examined. The total includes work done at the Ghi Testing Laboratory, Agra.

THROUGH SIND 109 carried out. Records throughout journeys were kept by the officer in medical charge and graphs prepared for each journey. Journeys through the Sind. Desert to Karachi were not accepted owing to the intense heat on this section of railway where Mean temperatures of 86° to 110° are experienced in June to August. From a consideration of shipping facilities and the stations from which troops would move the subject of the journey to Bombay or to Karachi be- came important. The advantages of the Bombay route in relation to tem- peratures encountered during the journey are shown by the graphs given below. These refer only to June, but similar differences are shown for the months of July and August. The hours spent in a temperature over the danger mark for Heatstroke are lengthy on the Karachi route and short on the Bombay route. Very special precautions were taken in respect of troops and families such as ample supplies of ice, one maund per compartment and five maunds per troops carriage twice daily: proper provision of fans: provision of ample drinking water: spraying of all compartments on the train as an anti-insect measure with pyrethrum solutions before occupation: entrainment as far as practicable early in the morning or at least shortly before departure: the proper spacing of meal hours and provision of meals suitable to requirements. In Waziristan District the special danger is the "Heat-Stroke Express" which runs at some 10 miles per hour from Mari Indus to Manzai. Ice blocks were issued to British troops and hand fans provided. There was one British case of heat exhaustion. Throughout the season there have been practically no adverse results from these hot weather journeys.

This must however be close at hand to the quarters otherwise the whole object is defeated; also if close at hand the latrine is likely to receive the better supervision. Group latrines of this type are being provided for new constructions. (iii ) Cantonment sanitation schemes and general control .113 holes to the space between them. The frame is fitted in place of a window in the cookhouse or dining room. Reports on this have now been received and vary from "most useful" and "excellent traps" to "poor", "ineffective" and "useless". As a whole they appear to be definitely of use provided they are properly made, provided no adventitious methods of escape are allowed to the captured flies and provided the trap does not appear definitely darker from the inside of the room than do the other fly proofed windows. (v ) Composting. 114 At Wana an excellent new tube well gives a full supply which together with the original fort-well and irrigation water is turning Wana into a garden city. At Bannu chloronomes have at last been provided for the two wells which were previously hand treated. To the writer's certain knowledge recom- mendations for the chloronomes have been made since 1929. At Nasirabad on the edge of the "Drought" area the water supply has been so much reduced that drastic restrictions had to be imposed and finally has necessitated the removal of all troops. New water supplies from deep tube wells have been provided in a number of places: Razmak, Lucknow and Agra. At the last a scheme of 5 new wells with high level tanks will give an ample supply. The standard of No-lactose-fractors-in-100 cc. is aimed at and laboratory reports indicate that this high standard is usually achieved in all our larger supplies. In several stations where municipal or other civil supplies are utilised in cantonments it has been found necessary to rechlorinate the supply to obtain results which satisfy our standards. For example at Secunderabad an additional chlorination plant was required at the Gun Rock distributing reservoir to give satisfactory results from the Hyderabad Chlorinated Supply. Similarly at Allahabad rechlorination was necessary. This may of course be due to the condition of the pipe system as in the case of Lahore (above). At both Bareilly and Roorkee, an investigation was carried out with regard to the presence of lactose fermenting organisms in the water supply. In both cases, the infection was considered to be taking place in the storage tanks, and steps are being taken to dust proof the tanks. In no instance were the lactose fermenting organisms adjudged to be typical coli, or faecal orga- nisms. A special report has been rendered on the supply at Bareilly. At Meerut one well produced suspicious water during the rains. This is being investigated by the R. E. with a view to increasing the protection of the well, and it is to be watched carefully this year. Fortunately the well can be cut out of use quite readily. (ii ) Fluorine content. 115 was dispelled in 1937 when they cut the aqueduct which carried water into Razmak and even more rudely shattered when in 1938 they poisoned the water in Asad Khel reservoir with picric acid. Once again in 1939 they interfered with our water supplies by unsuccess- fully attempting to poison with picric acid the drinking water reservoir at Dizh Narai. All water since May 1938 has been tested daily for poisons at Razani, Damdil and Thal, and occasionally at Mir Ali, a special attention being paid to tests for arsenic. By means of surprise tests it is ensured that all medical officers, assistant surgeons and sub-assistant surgeons in Waziristan are tho- roughly familiar with the use of the "Case, water testing, poisons". K. Sandfly fever enquiry. The field and part of the laboratory work of this enquiry was carried out by an officer of the R. A. M. C. with a small staff at Peshawar under the direction and pay of the Director, King Institute, Guindy, Madras. Field Work. Systematic trapping of sandflies showed that P. minutus and P. papatassi were not present either at the beginning of the season or in the autumn below maximum temperatures of about 75116 Two water-base insecticides, "Deskito" and "Multicide", were tested; but using a 7 per cent solution a concentration equivalent of 20 cc. pure solu- tion per 1,000 c.ft. is required for killing. The Phantomyst sprayer does not appear to have any real advantage over hand sprays. An effort has been made to determine the maximum altitude at which P. papatassi is found. The flies exist in large numbers at Landi Kotal, at 3,500 feet, where the disease is met with in epidemic form during the hot weather period. At Cherat (4,500 feet) at a distance of 40 miles; and Abbotta- bad (4,000 feet) distance 110 miles, the fever is reported as occurring in sporadic form, suggesting that the cases are either imported from the plains, or else incorrectly diagnosed. In each of these places, a trained collector worked for two weeks, and the collection of flies brought down were despatched to Guindy for identification. No P. papatassi were among the specimens found at Cherat and at Abbottabad only two were noted in the collection examined. Examination of earth samples for sandfly's larvae has been carried out by means of a special apparatus, in which the soil is broken up in a concentrated solution of magnesium sulphate and the supernatant material floated off to a settling tank and thence to a filter paper on a Buchner funnel. Of fifteen specimens examined, two have been positive, both of which were taken from shady places and contained a fair amount of moisture. Laboratory Work. Sera have been collected, during the first three days of fever, from seventy- eight cases of suspected sandfly fever. After dessication by a process of freezing in vacuo, over sulphuric acid, these sera were despatched to the King Institute for further examination. In Peshawar, seventy of these sera have been tested for the presence of virus by chorioallantoic membrane inoculation, with results as follows:117 Serum and C. S. F. from a case of sandfly fever collected on the 1st and 2nd day of the disease respectively were tested for the presence of virus. It was found to be present in both as judged by lesions obtained on egg mem- branes. 65. PATHOLOGY. The routine work again showed an annual increase during 1939. A total of 2,36,528 specimens were sent for laboratory examination during the year, 14,744 more than last year. This annual increase which has now taken place for some years past is considered to be due to the following three main factors:118 The serological findings in the following 8 bacteriologically proved cases show the uncertainty of the Widal reaction against 0 antigen in inoculated persons:119 TABLE 98 Vi antibody content in healthy inoculated personnel No. of cases examined. Vi titre 0 to 1/10 1/20 1/40 1/80 1/160 Per cent Per cent Per cent Per cent Per cent 79... 89.2 7.2 3.6 ... ... From the above tables it will be seen that both in inoculated and un- inoculated personnel, the Vi content of the serum is extremely low120 There is, however, one feature of the Vi curve in typhoid which seemed to distinguish it from the non-specific Vi curves not infrequently encountered in other diseases. The true Vi curve usually showed a definite rise and fall, though the peak may not have been very high: whereas the non-specific curve may be high to start with, but in subsequent tests showed a gradual or rapid fall121 In the case of Indian troops necessary examinations in order to exclude the carrier condition are undertaken by local military laboratories. Organisms of the Enteric Group were isolated from the urine of patients on 26 occasions. In last year's report several cases of Typhoid and Paratyphoid infection exhibited unusual features and were described, this year only two such cases arose. In one B. typhosum and B. Paratyphosum A were isolated from the blood culture, and in another B. typhosum and B. dysenteriac Shiga were isolated from the faeces. Organisms sent to the Enteric Laboratory, Kasauli, for confirmation or identi- fication.122 In one District four cases of infection with B. columbensis occurred. Three of the cases developed antibodies to a maximum titre between 100 and 250, and one to 500. One Indian other rank had a severe attack of the relaps- ing variety. The remaining three cases had urinary complications. Auto- genous vaccines were employed in treatment in a strength of 250 million orga- nisms per c.c. with beneficial results. Dysentery .123 Northern Command who head the list of successful isolations issued instruc- tions that this method was to be employed by all laboratories in the Command. Each hospital was initially supplied from the nearest military laboratory with a sufficient number of bottles containing the buffered glycerine and saline solution; and as each bottle containing a specimen of stool was received at the laboratory a fresh bottle containing sterile solution was sent back to the hospital. In this way it was ensured that hospitals always had available a suitable stock of filled bottles, while the cleaning, sterilizing and refilling were carried out in the laboratory. The above scheme achieves two aims:124 The distribution of the various strains of dysentery bacilli throughout the four Commands during 1939 is shown by laboratories in Table No. 101 and the percentage of each group in each Command in Table No. 102.

The greatest number of cases that occurred during any one month was at Dagshai where 8 infections with OXK were recorded in August. Investigations have been carried out by various workers both civil and military in an attempt to discover the vector of these fevers. The louse, flea, tick and mite have in turn been under suspicion but so far no definite conclusion has been reached. Brucella Group infections.128 The percentage of haemolysed or septic sera, and broken capsules received in the above laboratories was exactly the same as last year, only 1.5 per cent. which tends to show that great care must have been taken by hospitals in the taking and despatch of specimens for examination. The employment of the Kahn test as a check on the Wassermann test is considered by many to be most essential, especially from the point of view of technical errors which may be encountered in the actual performance of the tests. The check is also of value in the case of diseases which may give a false Wassermann reaction, and also in cases with no history of syphilis in which the diagnosis is " tonsil- litis " or perhaps " dermatitis ". In such cases a doubting medical officer may not accept the result of a single test with the result that treatment is delayed; but, if a positive Wassermann reaction is supported by a positive Kahn test treatment may be commenced immediately. In the case of syphilis a positive Wassermann reaction appears earlier than a positive Kahn, but on the other hand the latter persists longer, and so has a definite advantage as a control on the effects of treatment. The District Laboratory, Quetta, has continued the practice of bleeding guinea pigs for complement only once a month. The Officer Commanding the laboratory reports that he has had no difficulty in keeping complement frozen for six weeks or even two months and then still obtaining a satisfactory titre of 1/50. The work done in the four laboratories and results obtained are shown in Tables 106 and 107. TABLE 106 Wassermann and Kahn tests129 The number of cases diagnosed primary syphilis on a positive Wassermann reaction is still considered to be too high. In the case of Indian troops there is little doubt that many report late for examination having previously obtained local treatment in the bazaar. In the case of hospitals situated in a station where no laboratory facilities exist the practice is still continued of forwarding specimens of sera (taken from the sore) in capillary tubes to the nearest laboratory for examination. Experi- ence has shown that spirochaetes remain alive for many days under these conditions but medical officers seem to find it very difficult to send suitable specimens. In a large number of cases the specimens received consisted of blood only. In 50 cases however out of 300 forwarded for examination posi- tive results were obtained and enabled these patients to be treated before their Wassermann reaction became positive. The following tables show the method by which primary infections in the case of British and Indian troops were diagnosed throughout the year by Commands.

130 In one District Laboratory at the request of the Specialist in Dermatology complement deviation tests for gonorrhæa were undertaken with the object of deciding when the correct moment had arrived for beginning treatment with Sulphanilamide. At first a considerable number of tests were carried out; but, with the introduction of M. & B. 693, the value of the test declined and pari passu the number of sera received in the laboratory decreased. Malaria.131 Blood typing tests were carried out on 2,139 individuals which is an increase of 845 tests as compared with last year. All laboratories continue to prepare and store their own Group II and III sera in order to be in a posi- tion to carry out this important test. Blood sedimentation tests increased by 231 to 663. This test has become far more universal throughout labora- tories but as last year the greatest number was carried out at the District Laboratory, Razmak. This laboratory was also responsible for 164 reticulo- cyte counts out of a total of 300. Post mortem examinations were undertaken when considered necessary and numbered 91 of which 40 were performed in Eastern Command alone. In one case death was found to be due to meningitis caused by a typical B. influenzae, this organism was also recovered from pus in the right knee joint. All available literature has been studied but no record can be found of infec- tion of a joint cavity by this organism. Bacteriological examinations of water numbered 2,373 which is a slight decrease from last year. It was noted that lack of uniformity appeared to exist among laboratories in the methods of examining water bacteriologically, and in the expression of results, due probably to the various methods given in different text books. All laboratories have been circularised and recom- mended to employ the method laid down in the Ministry of Health Bulletin No. 71. Chemical examination of specimens of water are comparatively rarely asked for but numbered 197 as compared with 159 last year. Bacteriological examination of specimens of milk numbered 402 which corresponds closely with the total of last year's examinations. There were 1,526 examinations for the presence of T. pallida in scrapings of which 207 gave positive results. The diagnosis of syphilis by means of the Wassermann reaction or by the demonstration of the presence of T. pallida has already been referred to. A total of 9,431 specimens of urine were culturally examined which in cluded 1,243 examinations carried out in the Enteric Laboratory, Kasauli in connection with the investigation of convalescent patients who had suffered from infection with the Enteric Group. From the total number of specimens examined in all laboratories B. coli was isolated on 339 occasions. Scrapings from cases suspected of suffering from tropical sore numbered 523 as compared with 349 last year. Leishman-donovan bodies were de- monstrated on 147 occasions, the District Laboratory, Quetta, being respon- sible for 90 positive tests. As far as Quetta is concerned this is a very definite increase from last year, the Officer in charge of the laboratory attributing it to the arrival in Quetta of new "unsalted" troops. He also remarks that it is interesting to note that since his arrival in Quetta in 1936 he has only seen one case of an oriental sore on the face of an adult European female. Boys and girls are equally infected on the face. It appears that the powder and cosmetics used by ladies have a repellent effect. Ladies are mostly affected round the arms and legs. Further animal experiments on transmission of this condition were under- taken but results obtained were unsatisfactory and inconclusive. The increase in the number of cases infected this year in Quetta is of interest as it coincided with a decrease in the number of cases of sandfly fever although sandflies were unusually prevalent.
132 The quantities of serum and agglutinable suspensions issued to Labora- tories by the Enteric Laboratory, Kasauli, were as follows:133 In the case of Wellington a total of 1,075 examinations was carried out which included all routine examinations normally entrusted to District or Brigade laboratories. In the case of dysentery specimens showing a typical bacillary exudate causative organisms were isolated in 81 per cent. of cases, and in those with an indefinite exudate in 50 per cent. In the past it has been the custom for all results obtained by these en- larged clinical side rooms to be checked by the parent laboratory but in all cases results were found to be so satisfactory that this practice has been dis- continued. In December 1939 another enlarged clinical side room was opened at Wana and it is anticipated that it will prove itself to be as useful and efficient as those already established. Library. 134 A drug called Tebetren has been tried for treatment, but preliminary reports do not indicate any remarkable success. Malignant tertian malaria was considerably in evidence in certain areas and quartan cases were reported. Some of the malignant cases were definitely connected with infection at Kathgodam on the way to or from Ranikhet. (ii )Dysentery. 135 (vi ) Cysticercosis with convulsions was seen in a case in Lahore. He had been brought up in India, enlisted here and served here over 4 years. X-ray examination showed numbers of calcified cysts deep in the musculature of arms and legs. (vii ) Glandular fever.136 Extract from the Annual Report of the Medical Specialist, Deccan District, for the year 1939. 2. That on the whole the doses of the drug given are too small, either the daily total being too little, or if the initial daily dosage is adequate, it has not been continued long enough. In this connection it may be permissible to quote from an article by H. L. Marriot in the B. M. J., dated 11th November 1939, and which appears to be the standard dosage adopted by most autho- -rities now, and has been advocated by many other authorities in current literature with very mild modifications. It is necessary in treating Pneumonia to aim at securing and maintaining a blood concentration of sulphapyridine of not less than 4 mg. per 100 cm. In adults this level is usually achieved by a dosage of 2 grammes, followed in 4 hours by 2 grammes followed by one gramme four hourly. After 2½ days the dosage should be reduced to 0.5 gramme four-hourly for 24 hours and then 0.5 gramme 8 hourly for 32 hours, i.e ., a total of 23 grammes administered on a decreasing scale during 5 days. The drug should be given in all cases of Pneumonia, however late in starting it may be, as it helps to prevent such complications as empyema, etc. They were both British Troops, and were admitted with mild malaise, slight pyrexia, and discrete erthematous rashes, distributed chiefly on the back, the chest and the upper arms and legs. In neither case were there any definite physical signs, and in both cases, all symptoms cleared up completely within 48 hours without any special treatment. It is felt that both these cases are strongly presumptive of toxic reactions from the sulphonamide group, which must have been purchased privately as neither patient was on treatment from any Army source. Tests are being carried out at the British Section Hospital to see if there is any reliable test for the detection of the drug in the urine, and if there is, how long after the drug has ceased to be taken it will remain detectable. If any reliable evidence can be obtained a further report will be submitted. [The details of a suitable test have since this been circulated]. 67. Surgery. As can be seen from the list of operations and surgical treatments surgery for the Army in India covers a wide scope and provides very considerable diversity of practice for army surgeons. It is difficult to group descriptions of cases from the reports of numerous surgical specialists and it is therefore considered that the best picture can be given by quoting cases of interest. (i ) Fractures of course form a large proportion of military cases. Skeletal traction by pins and the use of Bohlers unpadded plaster fixation and traction. using Bohlers special series of metal frames is specially mentioned by several surgeons. The uniformly successful results with absence of invaliding and the freedom of the patient are particularly noted. Two cases of fractured pelvis with intra pelvic rupture of the urethra and other multiple injuries from riding accidents were successfully treated by passing and leaving in situ a rubber catheter without any local sutures; plaster and extension dealt with the fractures. A fractured skull with middle menin geal rupture and uninterrupted recovery after trephining. A lorry accident at Abbottabad filled the British wing of the hospital there with some remarkable cases; a gross rupture of the liver; a severe wound of the perineum and anum which recovered completely after gas gan- gene infection and a stormy convalescence; a compound depressed fracture of the front of the skull w th extensive facial and scalp laceration which healed by first intention and 11 other less serious cases.
137 These cases and a severe chest wound case with massive surgical emphy sema which recovered and many other cases speak volumes for the skill of the Nursing Services who were taken to assist with the cases and then left under trying hot weather conditions to complete the results of surgery. Large numbers of fractures treated successfully with no case of invaliding from this cause were recorded at Kohat and special comment is made on the reliable work of trained I. H. C. orderlies in this theatre. At Lucknow a B. O. R. with compound fracture of tibia and fibula deve- oped gas gangrene, two days after successful excision of the wound. Gangrene developed to the level of the knee with marked gas formation and amputation was performed to the lower 1/2 of the thigh. He made an uninterrupted re- covery. From Ranikhet a case of excision of the head of the radius for comminuted fracture is reported. Two operations were performed and patient returned to full duty with very slight limitation of movements. The value of portable X-ray sets is emphasised in the case of fractures and of gunshot wounds. (ii ) Gunshot wounds.138 Autotransfusion of blood from severe haemorrhage is mentioned as the method of treatment in two cases and success from drainage without removal of the appendix in children with acute perforated appendicitis is recorded in several cases (Ochsner-Sherren delay treatment).

141 68. Radiology. There has been a general increase in the work done, in some cases this has more than doubled in the past 5 years. A summary is given below and the complete table will be found in Part II. Film papers are now used to a great extent especially for positioning fractures after treatment. But comment is made that the definition is often not so good with papers and that they do not store well owing to the tendency to curl. Portable X-ray sets have repeatedly proved their value. In places where such are not available there is a strong demand for the provision of these sets. The examination of pulmonary cases, pyelography, control and examina- tion of stomach contents after barium meals are types of X-ray work which are increasing in our hospitals. At Rawalpindi 7 Nursing Sepoys of the I. H. C. were trained and qualified in electric message. At Quetta the new X-ray and electro-therapeutic block was taken into use and found to be eminently satisfactory. Cases of interest were:142 Class in which a contrast medium was used and nature of medium143 (ii) Premedication is extensively used by many anaesthetists: Sodium bromide grs. 40 and chloral hydrate 1 dr. followed at one hour before operation by hyoscine 1/100 gr. and morphia 1/6 gr. is one standard method. Others omit the morphia and use atropine 1/75 gr. (iii) The need for adequate training or refresher training of sub-assistant surgeons is stressed by several anaesthetists and in several centres instruction has been given to officers and members of the I.

Gone are the days of 2 months stay in hospital for gonorrhoea. The average length of stay is now reduced to 18 and even 14 or 12 days and must be reduced still further. Gonococci dis- appear in 2147 Several officers comment on the indifferent response given by Indian troops to antisyphilitic treatment compared with the 100 per cent successful treatments for British troops. Various reasons are suggested including the chances that the treatment prescribed never reaches the patient for whom it is intended. (iv ) Chancroid. 148 73. Ophthalmology. Large numbers of patients are seen by our Ophthalmologists. The eye specialist at Quetta who was new to Indian conditions comments on the extreme mildness of the trachoma which he has seen and the slight amount of permanent damage which appears to be caused. The typical linear scar is usually absent and only careful, well illuminated examination reveals the extent of the old infection. Acute conjunctivitis tends to light up the trachomatous conditions and he finds the best cure is conjunctival painting with silver nitrate 1 per cent on alternate days which clears the trouble in a month. His conclusion is that Trachoma as it is experienced in the Indian is no bar to enlistment in the Army unless it is very marked or in an early stage. On the other hand an experienced Ophthalmologist in South India makes the following observations:149 Large alkaline drinks cleared the temporary condition after a week, but a fort- night later progressive optic atrophy produced total blindness. A case of remarkable recovery was of a 3 year old girl with thick corneal opacity after injury by lime which cleared almost completely after 2 months treatment. Trauma cases were frequent, including a B. O. R. with a riccochet pellet from a dog-shooters gun, a boy falling on to a stick, and damage from hockey sticks, tennis balls and footballs. Malingering which had been absent last year has reappeared on the out- break of war, particularly amongst reservists. Night blindness is the com- monest pretence. It is most catching. 5 cases have been detected and were awaiting trial in one large station. Night blindness or alleged night blindness has also been reported from Southern Command amongst motor drivers after the outbreak of war. Such complaints are most difficult to refute. The specialist of the area concerned makes the following observations:150 In Meerut District there were 568 new cases and 2,700 cases treated as out-patients. These included 3 emergency Schwartz's mastoidectomies 2 B. O. Rs. and W/O of a British Officer.

Families Hospitals (British) (i) Hospitals, staffs and equipment.152 The need for early hospital treatment for acute dysentery and diarrhoea and the special need for pressing the fluid intake in the case of children is stressed. This is a point to which education at Welfare Centres should give particular attention. A further point is to make mothers, nurses and even medical men realise that the condition in children is more often than not a dysenteric infection and that this group "dysentery-diarrhoea" should be labelled, called and treat- ed as "dysentery". The expression used by a mother or medical attendant "just a touch of diarrhoea" is a misleading euphemism which so often pro- duces a fatal delay in carrying out the required energetic treatment. Parents should be made to realise that the child has "dysentery", the infection being due probably to flies or bad hygienic methods in their own household. In one fatal case of diarrhoea quoted from Deccan District the child's ayah was examined and found to be suffering from dysentery, B. flexner isolated from the stools, and two other children in the same family developed dysentery. From Quetta the following observation has been made by the Deputy Assistant Director of Pathology:153 Six cases of tropical Typhus were admitted in Lahore District: 4 at Dagshai and one each at Sanawar and Kasauli. Typhoid fever. 154 The general health and development of children in these schools has been good. The outstanding defect shown by many reports is the condition of their teeth. In one large district the proportion with defects was 33 per cent. Many parents do not seem to realise the importance of adequate care of the teeth by daily attention. In some measure it may also be due to defective feeding, though the appearance of a majority of children does not suggest any lack in the quantity or quality of their feeding. At several schools milk, a pint plus a sterile straw, is provided for 1 anna and some 75 per cent of the children take it. School buildings have been improved in many places by additions or alterations. New school buildings have been provided at long last at Dal- housie where an excellent well lit school room, a suitable cloak room, ablution room and storeroom have been added. At Cliffden it was hoped to provide an enlarged school but war has made this impossible. Drinking fountains and a safe piped water supply have now been provided in a number of schools, this is an important point in places where the restless school child requires an ample amount of drinking water. Lighting in many schools is still far from satisfactory and artificial light- ing where it exists is poor. Attention is being paid to this point. Positioning during work is a matter which requires constant care and efforts are being made to make teachers position-conscious. In conjunction with positioning during work special attention has been paid throughout the year to the question of seating of school children. Early in the year a circular was issued to all concerned giving the points which needed special supervision as regards size, shape and placing of desks and as regards size and shape of the chairs, the criterion being comfortable upright posture with feet firmly placed flat on the ground. It has been found that little difficulty occurs in obtaining satisfactory results for each child if the school mistress obtains the co-operation of the M. E. S. to get the right size desks and chairs. There has been a very marked improvement in the provision of proper desks and seats for children in our schools during the past 15 years. C. Child Welfare and Welfare Centres, Indian Families Hospitals British. 155 Indian .156 are treated it is found that the numbers admitted to the I. M. H. are less................ One feels that one must return thanks to the self sacrificing work of the wives of British Officers in the station for the time and energy which they have given to this work." The A. D. M. S., Rawalpindi district remarks as follows:157 (c ) Progress of the work done. 158 and the remainder from the Indian Expeditionary Force Canteen Profits Fund. Suitable lady doctors of the class required who will stay in their jobs are diffi- cult to obtain and some of them require to he handled with considerable tact. This need is however not entirely one-sided, because similar differences of opinion arise amongst those who control the activities of welfare centres and family hospitals. The officers and ladies of wealthy units which have had welfare centres going as flourishing concerns for some years are sometimes very loathe to combine in a station welfare movement or to share a troops family hospital with units not so fortunate. S. E. M. Os. and medical officers have no easy job at times to obtain the willing co-operation of all who consider that they should have a say in the control of affairs. Unified control on a station basis is essential if Welfare work is to play its full part in the improvement of the health of Indian families. In addition to the doctor family hospitals have one, two or even three trained nurses, trained dais and sweeper staff. In welfare centres the staff usually consist of a trained nurse, either resident or visiting, a trained dai and a female sweeper under the direct supervision of the Regimental Medical Officer who works in conjunction with one or more senior ladies of the unit. (f ) Funds.159 is based on the estimated needs and the demands received from all centres in their Annual Report and Budget Request Forms, Form A. G. 26. It should be noted that the funds available for distribution can only meet about two-thirds of the closely scrutinised demands. (g ) Confinement 160 A point which arises in carrying out full treatment is that it is especially difficult to ensure that family-patients continue their treatment to its end. They are exceedingly inclined to stop as soon as fever and symptoms subside. (It might be mentioned that British Officers and their families are not exactly exemplary in this respect).
