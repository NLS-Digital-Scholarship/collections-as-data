All solid excremen- titious matter is removed every morning by the conservancy carts. The men resort to the large open public latrine. So far as was practicable the military authorities have exercised a strict supervision in keeping the large and small drains open so that no recommendations were required. Water. supply. Water-supply has been good in quality and abundant in quantity from rivers, tanks, and deep wells; the first source being much the most pure and best, hardness but 3½°, solid contents 68 grains per gallon. The tanks rank next in softness and purity; the wells, varying from 20 to 40 feet in depth, have a hardness of from 12° to 77°, and contain from 18 to 182 grains of solids per gallon, chiefly chlorides and sulphates.

Coorg almost escaped the scourge, which was also but little felt in the Kurnool District. The incidence of the disease was most severely felt in Cuddapah, Mysore, and Bellary. To the Sanitarian cholera means dirt, and truly there is no lack of this in the Mysore Province and in the Ceded Districts. A year which is favourable to the spread of cholera is generally favourable to the spread of small-pox; in this case, however, the number of cases of the latter disease registered for 1875 fell below that registered for 1874 by 1,238. This decrement is most distinctly seen in the returns from Mysore, Coorg, and Cuddapah, the increment in those from Bellary and Kurnool. In Mysore and Coorg the disease was of a mild character, owing probably to the fact that it repre- sented the progressive subsidence of an epidemic which reached its acme in 1872. As regards the great class of fevers, it is be noted that, alike in Mysore and in the Ceded Districts, the number of casualties exceeds that of 1874, one proof that the presence in an epidemic form of a disease such as cholera is not necessarily accompanied with a corresponding diminution in the casualty returns from other diseases. 86,969 casualties from "fever" occurred in this administrative circle during 1875, or 15,219 more than in 1874. When we remember how comparatively small is the percentage of mortality of many of these fevers, some idea may be formed of their universal prevalence on the Mysore plateau and in the Ceded Districts. Although the past year was pre-eminently a cholera year, yet no marked increase in the return of casualties from bowel-complaints is noted. 12
46 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF MADRAS. Bangalore. Meteorology. MYSORE DIVISION. 47 the great and pressing subject of sanitation is securing the attentive consideration of all author- ities, whether military, civil or medical, and that fair, though not always rapid, progress is being made in reducing the principles of the science to practice. Beyond the heavy expense involved there are few or no difficulties experienced in applying the laws and principles of sanitary science to European troops in India, but it is different with Native troops, whose habits and prejudices run counter to many of the arrangements and restrictions necessary to secure the required health state of their houses and lines. As regards the new lines which have lately been built, as in the case of the Sappers and Miners, or which are being constructed as in the case of the 36th M.N.I. at Bangalore, the prominent defects of the old lines have been avoided, and arrangements have been made for the due conservancy of the huts, as well as for the drainage and cleanliness of the lines. It is a matter of some difficulty and of constant labour to keep the old lines and huts in a satisfactory state of sanitation. The huts, generally speaking, are small, constructed of mud, defective in ventilation, in light, in the arrangements required for latrines and lavatories, and defective also as regards drainage. The streets of the lines are frequently much too narrow, and the total absence of artificial drainage leads necessarily to the extreme sulliage of the soil and to the inevitable pollution of the water of the neighbouring wells. The lines of the 23rd Regiment W.L.I. afford a good illustration of the objectionable features of these older lines. Still it must be admitted that these evils are reduced considerably by the constant supervision of military and medical officers, and by the constant activity of the conservancy department. I am of opinion that the sepoy should be hutted by Government; that his hut and lines should be erected on proper principles; that especial care should be taken in the erection of the hut, privy and lavatory and of the regimental latrines; that overcrowding of the hut should be forbidden; that artificial drainage should in all cases be adopted; and that simple but efficient sanitary arrangements should be enforced. All this can be done without interfering with the innocuous habits of the native, interference being only necessary when these habits and customs are followed in an objectionable and insanitary manner. The unit of sanitary administration in civil life is the house, in military life the sepoys' hut, and until these houses and huts are placed in a sanitary condition, the mere sanitation of sur- roundings will have but little influence upon the mortality and sickness ratios. The tendency of our sanitary arrangements is chiefly centripetal, and sanitation has a tendency to stop short outside the house or hut; it would be well in my opinion if there were also a centrifugal tendency carrying sanitation from the house towards the surroundings. The regimental lines at this station are, with the exception of the eastern hutting lines, good. Those at Bellary are old and susceptible of improvement. The lines at the French Rocks are clean and well conserved; those at Mercara are still incomplete, at least as regards the left wing huts.

The average daily sick per mille of strength when applied as a test of the health state of regiments ranges them in the order noted in the margin. The high numbers of the three regiments last on the list are due not so much to causes operating during last year, as to the antecedent low health state of the corps from original poor physique and defective lines, from service in Burmah and Arracan, and from residence in Coorg.

Attention must be given to the annual invaliding list and to the various causes which have led to the loss which, from this cause, the regiment has sustained. The numbers pensioned or discharged in the Mysore Division and Ceded Districts during the present and two previous years are as follows:MYSORE DIVISION. 55 Diseases of Men sent on Sick Certificate during the Year.

It is framed from the " constitutional statements" furnished to this office. The strength is that of regiments as they stood on the last day of the year. Companies of the Sappers and Miners absent from head-quarters are excluded. The entire absence of a death casualty in the 4th Regiment L.C. was noted in the report of last year, and has fortunately to be noted again on this occasion. The explanation lies probably in this, that the regiment numbers a little over 200 sabres; that, owing to non-recruital by enlistment for many years, the troopers are men who have reached mid-life; and that they have had the advantage of serving in a climate peculiarly favourable to the preservation of the health of the native soldier.

At the same time it must be remembered that, as a rule, the sanitary condition of native lines is more satisfactory than that of most native towns and villages, hence we may expect that they will exhibit a mortality somewhat less than the casualty ratio of the general native population. The stations marginally noted give the ratios of mortality according to a descending scale. Passing over the case of the 4th Light Cavalry, which is exceptional, it is to be noted that the mortality ranges from 21.38 per mille at the French Rocks to 44.17 per mille at Mercara. Attention is solicited to the widely different ratios of mortality yielded by the 36th and 23rd Regiments, which occupy contiguous lines at Bangalore, the former showing a mortality per mille of 21.39, the latter of 35.64. The former regiment has lost 19, the latter 37 children. The influence of station and situation upon the life of children is given in the following table:58 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF MADRAS. The total number of Europeans of all ranks, staff and regimental, in the Mysore and Ceded Districts Commands during the past year amounted to 165.01, of whom 60 were admitted to the sick list and 1 died. The corresponding numbers for 1874 were 172, 76, and 4. 1874. 1875. Admitted to strength.............. 442 363.61 Died to strength.............. 23.2 6.06 The principal causes of sickness, noted in the order of their frequency, are as follows:MYSORE DIVISION. 59 1866 108.8 1867 116.09 1868 201.9 1869 109.6 1870 117.2 1871 169.1 1872 132.81 1873 136.64 1874 151.2 The ratio of admissions for 1875 per mille of strength for the period of occupation amounts to 170.8. The corresponding ratios for the last nine years are given in the margin. Out of a total of 282 cases, or 52.8 per cent., were due to primary or secondary syphilis. This table shows that venereal diseases have been steadily on the increase since 1866 among European soldiers. 1868 being a year of exceptional severity, and when it is considered that about 50 per cent. of all attacks are due to primary and secondary syphilis, the serious character of the question becomes apparent. It is true that medical officers urge that the disease is of a milder type than it used to be, and that during the latter months of 1875 the proportion of European soldiers infected was lower than usual, still the fact remains prominent that the ratio per mille of European troops affected with venereal diseases is on the increase, and that 52.8 per cent. of these are cases of syphilis. I attribute the somewhat unsuccessful working of the Lock Hospital at Bangalore to the radical deficiency of the rules under which the Contagious Diseases Act is worked. The limitation of the rules to prostitutes consorting with Europeans may be a necessary and a politic measure, but it is one which effectually prevents radical measures being applied for the suppression of venereal disease in the very class for whose special benefit the shackled rules have been devised. Registered prostitutes constitute but a very small fraction of the prostitution of the station and Pété, and it is not always, or even generally, with registered women that the soldier consorts. Registered women consort freely with natives, and thus the soldier is at all times in nearly as great danger from registered as from unregistered women. H.M.'s 89th Regiment 13 Do. Royal Artillery 10 Do. 18th Hussars 4 Do. 45th Regiment 12 Total 39 No departmental zeal and activity, no energy on the part of the ruling Committee, Police or Magistracy can ever effect more than the partial success of radically imperfect rules. The Lock Hospital acts by limiting somewhat the spread of venereal disease, and, it has been urged, by diminishing also its severity. Of the correctness of this latter view I am not quite satisfied, for the marginal return shows that during 1875 39 cases of secondary syphilis were treated in the European hospitals of this station. The detective agency has been made more efficient since last report. A Police Serjeant and two special constables have been entrusted with the duty of serving summonses upon prostitutes who attend weekly on examination days, and also of prosecuting those who fail to attend; "but there appears to be," adds Dr. C. Smith, "no special arrangement for preventing unlicensed prostitutes frequenting the lines" or for detecting clandestine prostitution. Infected men are unable or unwilling to indicate the women with whom they have consorted, and even registered women are not always willing to give up the names and places of residence of others who are unregistered. The registration of prostitutes is consequently very defective. Conviction of unregistered prostitutes is also difficult to obtain. Of the 104 registered women present on the 1st of January 1875, 58 are reported by the Police as having left the station and 4 died in hospital; 26 women were registered during 1875, leaving 68 on the register on the 1st January 1876. The Lock Hospital having fallen to ruins, the women were removed on the 3rd of June to the Soldiers' Rest-house as a temporary measure, where they still were at the close of the year. The hospital stands greatly in need of the services of an active and vigilant matron. Bellary 60 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF MADRAS.

The proportion of syphilitic cases to other forms of venereal disease is, however, very high, being over 65 per cent. for 1875. The number of registered women on the list at the close of 1874 was 83 and at the close of 1875, 102. In the cases of registered women syphilis generally appears as a mild and manageable disease, the severer cases of the malady being principally met with in non-registered cases and in females who came to the cantonment from the districts. Venereal disease is very common in domestic life all through the Ceded Districts. The detective agency is insufficient; the duties in connexion with the Lock Hospital being simply added to the ordinary duties of the Police force, they come to be regarded as of inconsiderable importance, or, at all events, as altogether of secondary importance to the legitimate duties of the department. A special and active agency is required, and a corresponding vigour would seem to be called for in conducting the magisterial duties connected with prostitution. In my last report I alluded to the Police as active propagators of venereal disease. Dr. Cleveland concludes his annual report for 1875 with the following remarks: " The absent women are not, as a rule, apprehended, and several who indulge in promiscuous prostitution are not brought on the register. Whether these are known to, and connived at by, the Police for pecuniary bribes or other considerations, is a question not capable of solution, but the allegation has often been made. The large number of venereal cases which occur among the Police is a sure indication that they consort much with this class of women."

Men frequently report sick after unavoidable night duty. The average number of nights in bed to one on duty has been 3.10. Looking to the admission of 78 per cent. of strength into hospital during the year, it may safely be said that the duty does exercise an injurious influence on health, but it is not the duty alone, as insufficient nourishment, wretched accommodation, bad drainage of the lines, &c., all tend in the same direc- tion.

The other trees that only can flourish are Capparis horrida, Balanites Ægyptica, Zizyphus jujuba, Ficus benghalensis, Bignonia suberosa, Tamarindus Indicus, Cassia fistula, Cassia Roxburghia, Cathartocarpus Indica, Feronia elephantum, Azadiracta Indica. Vegetables are scarce on account partly of the difficulty of obtaining water free from salts, and the cultivation of garden flowers is for a similar reason most difficult Dry cultivation in the district is almost the only practicable method in consequence of the absence of tanks. Cholum is princi- pally cultivated. The black soil produces cotton in great abundance. Sheep, goats, and cows are numerous. The jackal and fox are the only wild animals to be found in this vicinity.

The first increase of sickness was coincident with the outbreak of the south-west monsoon, when cold, strong winds, often assuming the character of storms, attended with rain and a variable temperature, prevailed night and day. The second unhealthy period was simultaneous with the occurrence of the north-east monsoon commencing towards the end of October. The individuals seized were those labouring more or less under malarial dyscrasia contracted in Arracan and the Nicobars, the chill serving to excite the disease germs into operation. This opinion is founded upon and borne out by the very moderate prevalence of malarial disease amongst other native troops or the native civil community at this station. Certain conditions of soil, topography, and climate must therefore be in conjunction aiding each other in maintaining a pure atmosphere, and either neutralizing the action of other agents, or rendering impossible the generation in any considerable amount of the disease principle which produces malarial fevers. A few of these favourable peculiarities are at once distinguishable: the soil is dry, free from swamps and exuberant vegetation, and every where open and accessible to the action of the sun and winds. Moreover dry cultivation only can be practised, thus removing another possible source of evil apt to arise from subsoil saturation and imperfect drainages. The prevailing weather is dry, and seldom muggy or depressing. I observe with much satisfaction that chronic rheumatism with its frequent concomitant of impairment of motor and sensitive power of the extremities, which was an abiding source of trouble and cause of non-efficiency in Burmah, has almost ceased to appear on the sick report since the arrival of the regiment here. Its cause was then ascribed to excessive and prolonged humidity of soil and atmosphere in conjunction with sudden changes of temperature occurring in a parti- cularly-marked degree at night, and the immunity enjoyed in the dry and less variable temperature of this station goes to confirm that opinion. Dysentery ranked third in the list, and presented a high figure in 1874, but its occurrence for the past year was much less frequent. The other diseases do not call for special remarks, being for the most part trifling and accidental. Deputy Surgeon-General George Smith, M.D., inspected this corps on the 23rd February 1876, and reports as follows:78 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF MADRAS Years.

In 1874 there were 64 admissions for secondary to 39 of primary syphilis. In 1875 there were 72 admissions from secondary to 201 of primary syphilis. On the 1st of January 1875 there were 94 prostitutes on the register in the Trimulgherry and Secundera- bad bazaars; 66 were added during the year, making a total of 160; but of this number 43 either absconded or removed their names, leaving a balance of 117 on the 31st December. There has been an increase in the numbers on the register as compared with the previous year of 23. Disease has increased greatly among the prostitutes, 300 admissions against 161 in the previous year 1874.

Ague*has been the cause of 50 per cent. of the total admissions; but, being of a mild type, and amenable to treatment, it does not seem to have had any marked deleterious effect on the health of the men generally. One sickly young man died from fever. Cholera appeared in the lines in September and remained till October 6th, the date of the occurrence of last case; five cases occurred and two died. Its origin was not traceable, but cholera existed in different parts of the station at the time, though not in the neighbourhood of the lines; also the regiment at the time afforded the Residency escort at Chadderghat, where cholera existed, and though no cases occurred amongst the men there, still there may have been some communication between the men and their families (though it was prohibited), and the disease thus brought into the lines. The state of vaccination in the regiment and lines is good and only a few children and recruits remain unprotected. 40th Regiment Natibe Infantry.

In my opinion little or nothing can be done, "unless at very great expense to Government," to improve matters in this respect. I would advise the building of new lines on higher ground, which can easily be obtained a little to the south of the present lines, and why this position was not in the first instance selected is a mystery to me. The men's huts are as well ventilated as native huts usually are, and the lines are kept very clean. The accommodation in the lines having been found insufficient for the five companies, of which the regiment is at present composed, some twenty or thirty huts a little to the east of the lines were built, which now afford accommodation for all; there does not appear to he any overcrowding.

It will always exist as long as the present arrangements continue, and until the men are allowed to bring their families with them, in which case they would, in my opinion, be content to remain five or six years instead of three as at present. During my visit to Thayetmyo I had to call attention to the overcrowding of some of the blocks of buildings occupied by the 6th N.I., and also of the hospital, and suggested a simple arrangement for the relief of the latter. I have not heard if anything has been done in consequence. Some ground in the vicinity of the quarters occupied by the Ordnance Serjeants and Conduc- tors at Rangoon being in a swampy condition, was brought to the notice of the General Commanding, and has since been drained. The quarters themselves are particularly unhealthy, especially during the rains, and require entire reconstruction. 4th Regiment Native Infantry.

In all cases their pulse, temperature, and urine were normal, appetite good, bowels regular, and they daily grew stout while in hospital. On carefully examining the feet nothing could be discovered to account for the above symptoms. Medicine of all kinds, both internal and external, proved useless, so I resorted to repeated blisterings with the best results, and in a short time they were all cured. I am not aware that there is at the present time a single case in the regiment. There were other men who purposely produced swelling of the legs, others sore-eyes, some dysentery, and a number reduced themselves to a low debilitated state from pure starvation.
