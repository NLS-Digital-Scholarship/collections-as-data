In Cachar, Lakhimpur, and Sibságar, the tea-plantations were visited. The tea-planters gave great assistance in Cachar, sending to the Civil Surgeon certificates of the number of successful cases. In most of the reports it is stated that the Civil authorities aided the work. The Deputy-Commissioners of Kámrúp and the Khási Hills took more than usual interest in the matter, and used their personal influence in the villages while on tour. It is said in the Nowgong report that the aid of the civilians and influential natives was not required. This view does appear to be borne out by the amount of work done. III.( 6 ) 5. Kamrúp.( 7 ) 1. Cachar.( 8 ) In Cachar and Nowgong the proportion of inoculated children to prisoners is very high. If inoculation be spread equally through the population and the prisoners belonging to the district, the conclusion would be that the practice of inoculation has been more common in the last ten years than it formerly was. In Goálpára, Sibságar, and Sylhet, there is little difference between the children and prisoners. In Sibságar, judging from the returns, inoculation is not so common as in other districts, and here vaccination has been brought to bear on the two classes under consideration.

No. 367 S. FROM J. J. CLARKE, ESQ., M.D., Deputy-Surgeon-General, H. M.'s Forces, Eastern Frontier District, and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam, To C. J. LYALL, ESQ., M.A., C.I.E., C.S., Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam, Dated Shillong, the 29th June 1882. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit the Vaccination Report of this Province for 1881-82. 2. The Report until this year has not been printed in a complete form since 1875, and on this occasion I have endeavoured to illustrate the work and the agency employed as clearly as possible. 3. In 1875 a scheme for circle vaccination was submitted by this office to the Assam Administration and the Government of India but it was allowed to drop out of sight, and until last season no addition to the vaccination staff of 17 or 18 dispensary vaccinators has been made. 4. By the continued zeal and efforts of Civil Medical Officers and the strengthening their hands, when circumstances warrant, by an increase of the vaccination staff, time will doubtless overcome the prejudices of the people and the vaccination work of this Province will in due course take a fair stand and compare favourably with that of other Provinces. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient Servant, J. J. CLARKE, M.D., Sanitary Commissioner, Assam.

And so again with lymph: they should procure a small supply of good lymph from England stored in capillary tubes and sent out so as to reach Assam early in October, packed and ready for distribution to their several gardens. By such an arrangement, at a very trifling expense and independent of Government help, which should not be sought or expected, tea-garden managers might perform a noble and praiseworthy duty which hitherto has been almost universally neglected. Sanctioned scale of cost of vaccination establishment, with recommend- ations for further strengthening the hands of the executive. 11. The subjoined statement, No. VII., sets forth the sanctioned scale of pay of the vaccination establishment in this Province for the past season:OF THE PROVINCE OF ASSAM. 7 sanctioned: these will be put up in 11 packets of 20 tubes each and despatched from England so as to reach India not later than the 1st September 1882, and as soon as these packets are received by me, I will at once distribute them to the several district medical officers. I have also placed myself in communication with the Sanitary Commissioner, Bombay, in the hope of obtaining from him a small supply of calf or animal lymph at the commencement of next vaccination season. I entertained at one time the hope of raising animal or calf lymph myself, but as the procedure is somewhat complicated and in the absence of an establishment of any kind I doubt if I shall succeed in doing so at present. I would suggest to Civil Surgeons, as in all probability practicable, the advisability of their securing vaccine lymph in capillary tubes, or on ivory points, at or towards the end of the next vaccination season, and sending such supply as they are assured is of good and undoubted quality to me. The capillary tubes hermetically sealed might be secured in small pieces of bamboo with a pledget of cotton wool at the end and then sealed. The ivory points, properly charged, should be slowly dried and then placed in a small two-drachm bottle, in the bottom of which a little cotton-wool has been previously placed, and a morsel of cotton-wool is to be put into the bottle before closing it with an accurately-fitting cork. These, when received, I woud keep stored in a cool place until the next vaccination season, when I would distribute to the Medical Officers to whom they might belong, and I see no reason why pure good lymph so secured may not be preserved during the hot season at Shillong, and be ready at hand when the vaccination work begins. The sources whence lymph was supplied during the past vaccination season. 13. The following abstracts from the reports of medical officers show the sources from which the lymph was supplied during the past season, and the success of the various supplies :8 ANNUAL VACCINATION REPORT the subject of vaccination, for, if in the whole science of curative or preventive medicine one thing more than another is proved, it is that one of the direst scourges that ever afflicted humanity is controlled exactly in proportion as the operation of vaccination is well and thoroughly performed among the population. The earnest and most untiring efforts of medical officers will be necessary as each vaccination season comes round, and they should not, I think, despair of ultimate success even among a people so apparently averse to vaccination as the Assamese are said to be, or yet in a Province where the difficulties of transit and means of moving about among the population are unsurpassed in India. The duties of Civil Surgeon in the employ- ment of vaccinators. 15. We have, I think, no reason to be dissatisfied with the increase of work done last year by the increase of the staff of vaccinators, especially when we remember the lateness of the season before that increase could be made; and as executive medical officers now have the assurance of the Chief Commissioner that he is ready to sanction an increase of expenditure to meet an increase of the staff or pay of the vaccinators, if he can be satisfied that correspondingly improved results will be obtained, Civil Surgeons should consider it a part of their duty to secure as far as possible the services of men of some family respectability, as I pointed out in paragraph 7 of my last year's report, and they should endeavour to raise the status of the vaccinator, and train and employ men in whom reliance can be placed, with the view not only of improving the quality of the vaccination work, but of raising the standard and the sense of responsibility of the vaccinators themselves. In such districts, too, where a disposition is shown by the people to adopt vaccination, and the work appears to warrant it, the advisability of the appointment of a head vaccinator, or even a native superintendent, should claim consideration. SHILLONG. 16. Khási and Jaintia Hills.OF THE PROVINCE OF ASSAM. 9 from successful cases in the station. There were three ex-inoculators who worked, and reported having performed 305 operations. But their work was not inspected. Two or three severe outbreaks of small-pox have prevailed during the year in the district, one especially in the north-east quarter, where Mr. McNaught, a Hospital- Assistant, and two vaccinators proceeded, and rendered during the epidemic every possible service. There were four vaccinators employed for eight months in this district, and the Deputy-Commissioner and Medical Officer appear to be of opinion that with a stronger staff of vaccinators the Gáros would be brought to adopt vaccination entirely, and the scourges of small-pox might be diminished, if not in due course stamped out altogether. One fact appears clear, that the greater the success of vaccination and the more the system is encouraged, the readier the people are to adopt it and to discountenance inoculation. DHUBRI. 18. Goálpára District.10 ANNUAL VACCINATION REPORT Both the Deputy-Commissioner and Civil Surgeon speak very highly of the hearty co-operation in the work of vaccination given during the season by Mr. H. Bell, Manager, Lower Assam Tea Company, not only as regards the tea-garden population, but also by extending vaccination to neighbouring villages. The work was entirely done by the Native Doctor of the tea-garden, who successfully vaccinated 165 cases. This hearty co-operation of Mr. Bell's in the work of vaccination is a worthy example, and might with great advantage be followed by every tea-garden manager in Assam. Messrs. Gilman Bros., Sonapur, also gave marked and careful attention to the vaccination of their tea-garden coolies. NOWGONG. 20. Nowgong District.OF THE PROVINCE OF ASSAM. 11 Lymph supplied from the North-Western Provinces and Oudh, from Calcutta, from England, all reported a failure until the 30th November, when one successful case supplied good lymph, when operations gradually commenced. SIBSÁGAR. 22. Sibságar District.12 ANNUAL VACCINATION REPORT performed 647 primary operations, of which 429 were successful. By this dispensary agency there was a total of 1,552 vaccinations, of which 1,104 were successful; against 1,454 vaccinations, of which 1,251 were successful. One ex-inoculator vaccinated 537 persons, with a reported success of 100 per cent. which is absurdly improbable. Surgeon Shewan, who was in charge of the civil, as a collateral charge to those of his military, medical duties, visited the vaccination work carried on around the station, and he supervised that of the Hospital-Assistant, but he did not record the number of his inspections. Inoculation is practised in the district; and outbreaks of small-pox often occur, but they do not appear so prevalent or so virulent as in some other districts. The lymph was obtained from Bengal, but its quality was at first doubtful. The indigenous population do not appear very averse to vaccination, and better work than during the past year may be expected, and should be shown next season. SYLHET. 25. Sylhet District.OF THE PROVINCE OF ASSAM. 13 SILCHAR. 26. Cachar District.14 ANNUAL VACCINATION REPORT APPENDIX A. INSTRUCTIONS FOR VACCINATORS . (Prescribed by the Order of the Privy Council, 29th July 1871.) 1. Except so far as any immediate danger of small-pox may require, vaccinate only subjects who are in good health. As regards infants, ascertain that there is not any febrile state, nor any irritation of the bowels, nor any unhealthy state of skin; especially no chafing or eczema behind the ears, or in the groin, or elsewhere in folds of skin. Do not, except of necessity, vaccinate in cases where there has been recent exposure to the infection of measles or scarlatina, nor where erysipelas is prevailing in or about the place of residence. 2. In all ordinary cases of primary vaccination, if you vaccinate by separate punctures, make such punctures as will produce at least four separate good-sized vesicles, not less than half an inch from one another; or, if you vaccinate otherwise than by separate punctures, take care to produce local effects equal to those just mentioned. 3. Direct care to be taken for keeping the vesicles uninjured during their progress, and for avoiding afterwards the premature removal of the crusts. 4. Enter all cases in your Register on the day when you vaccinate them, and with all particulars required in the Register up to column 9, inclusive. Enter the results on the day of inspection. Never enter any results which have not been inspected by yourself or your legally qualified deputy. In cases of primary vaccination, register as &quot;successful&quot; only those cases in which the normal vaccine vesicle has been produced; in cases of re-vaccination, register as &quot;successful&quot; only those cases in which either vesicles, normal or modified, or papules surrounded by areolæ, have resulted. When the vaccination of an unsuccessful case is repeated, it should be entered as a fresh case in the register. 5. Endeavour to maintain in your district such a succession of cases as will enable you uniformly to vaccinate with liquid lymph directly from arm to arm; and do not, under ordinary circumstances, adopt any other method of vaccinating. To provide against emergencies, always have in reserve some stored lymph; either dry, as on thickly-charged ivory points constantly well protected from damp, or liquid, in fine, short, uniformly capillary (not bulbed) tubes, hermetically sealed at both extremities. Lymph, successfully preserved by either of these methods, may be used without definite restriction as to time; but with all stored lymph caution is necessary, lest in time it have become inert, or otherwise unfit for use. If, in order to vaccinate with recent liquid lymph, you convey it from case to case otherwise than in hermetically-sealed capillary tubes, do not ever let more than eight hours intervene before it is used. 6. Consider yourself strictly responsible for the quality of whatever lymph you use or furnish for vaccination. Never either use or furnish lymph which has in it any, even the slightest, admixture of blood. In storing lymph, be careful to keep separate the charges obtained from different subjects, and to affix to each set of charges the name, or the number in your register, of the subject from whom the lymph was derived. Keep such note of all supplies of lymph which you use or furnish as will always enable you, in any case of complaint, to identify the origin of the lymph. 7. Never take lymph from cases of re-vaccination. Take lymph only from subjects who are in good health, and, as far as you can ascertain, of healthy parentage; preferring children whose families are known to you, and who have elder brothers or sisters of undoubted healthiness. Always carefully examine the subject as to any existing skin disease, and especially as to any signs of hereditary syphilis. Take lymph only from well-characterised uninjured vesicles. Take it (as may be done in all regular cases on the day week after vaccination) at the stage when the vesicles are fully-formed and plump, but when there is no perceptible commencement of areola. Open the vesicles with scrupulous care to avoid drawing blood. Take no lymph which, as it issues from the vesicle, is not perfectly clear and trans- parent, or is at all thin and watery. From such a vesicle as vaccination by puncture commonly produces, do not, under ordinary circumstances, take more lymph than will suffice for the immediate vaccination of five subjects, or for the charging of seven ivory points, or for the filling of three capilla- ry tubes ; and from larger or smaller vesicles take only in like proportion to their size. Never squeeze or drain any vesicle. Be careful never to transfer blood from the subject you vaccinate to the subject from whom you take lymph. 8. Scrupulously observe in your inspections every sign which tests the efficiency and purity of your lymph. Note any case wherein the vaccine vesicle is unduly hastened or otherwise irregular in its development, or wherein any undue local irritation arises; and, if similar results ensue in other cases, vaccinated with the same lymph, desist at once from employing it. Consider that your lymph ought to be changed, if your, cases, at the usual time of inspection on the day week after vaccination, have not, as a rule, their vesicles entirely free from areolæ. 9. Keep in good condition the lancets or other instruments which you use for vaccinating, and do not use them for other surgical operations. When you vaccinate, have water and a napkin at your side, with which invariably to cleanse your instrument after one operation before proceeding to another.

Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner of Assam, in the General Department, No. 4,450, dated Shillong, the 17th August 1882. READ( 2 ) patients. At the same time, he thinks that vaccination might successfully be made compul- sory by law in Sylhet, and that the opposition to it arises partly from a distrust of the intentions of Government and of the arguments used to induce voluntary submission to it. Average number of operations performed by vaccinators in each district. 4. The other additions to the staff were in the districts of the Assam Valley: the increase was, as Dr. Clarke explains, made in October, which was too late to enable the men to be set to work as early as was desirable. The Chief Commissioner hopes for better results during next season. An average of at least 1,000 operations for each vaccinator employed should be capable of attainment, and is actually- attained in many other parts of India. Yet Appendix B, Statement III., shows that this moderate figure is approached only in Cachar (913) and the Khási Hills (900), where no additional men were employed. The average number of operations per man in other districts is shown below :( 3 ) of all persons passing through contractors' depôts (which description till the end of last year included not only contractors' but also the bulk of sardári coolies) not already protected from small-pox. And thus the unprotected population on the plantations should consist only of free labourers, and of the children of contract coolies born in the Province. From what he has seen on his tours among the tea-gardens, Mr. Elliott believes that planters are already fully alive to the advantage of thoroughly carrying out vaccination on their gardens, an advantage which is of the most direct kind, as a small-pox outbreak would seriously interfere with the efficiency of their labour force ; and he has found vaccination practised wherever he has enquired into the subject. He cannot, therefore, altogether accept Dr. Clarke's view (paragraph 10 of the report) that the matter has been neglected by tea-planters; and he has no doubt that if facilities are afforded them for obtaining lymph from successful cases already established in the district, they will do all in their power to spread vaccination among the people in their employ. It is, he thinks, too much to expect that planters should import their own lymph, except where gardens are in charge of European Doctors, who are aware of the sources of supply and the procedure to be adopted for procuring it. But all Civil Surgeons should, on application, arrange for the Hospital-Assistant on each garden where the manager desires it being supplied with virus from some properly established vesicle in the neighbourhood. Proportion of success attained. 8. Turning now to the success attained by the different classes of operators, the Chief Commissioner finds that of the primary vaccinations (including tea-garden cases), 44,230 in number, 38,741, or 87.5 per cent., are returned as successful. Of re-vaccinations, 1,181 in number, the unusually large proportion of 1,118, or 94.6 per cent., were successful. Last year the figures were 87.6 for primary vaccinations ; none of the re-vaccinations in 1880-81, 12 in number, were successful. The table below shows the proportion of success attained by each class of operators with primary vaccinations:( 4 ) Nága Hills, Sibságar, and Cachar. The inspection done was greatest in the Gáro Hills and Nowgong, and least in Goálpára. The improvement in the second of these districts, as compared with last year, is very creditable to the Civil Medical Officer. Supply of lymph. 10. The Sanitary Commissioner has noticed the important question of the supply of lymph at considerable length in the Report, and the Chief Commissioner's special acknowledgments are due to him for the care and thought he has bestowed on the subject. The record of failures is still too long, but probably the arrangements which Dr. Clarke has recently made will show better results in the coming season. In many instances the ultimate source of the lymph obtained is not stated : it is said to have been supplied by such and such an officer, but no information is given as to whether it came originally from England (as the Chief Commissioner ascertained to be the case at Dhubri, where the lymph is shown in the report as supplied by the Sanitary Commissioner, Bengal), or from one of the depôts established in the Himalayas. So far as the report shows, it would seem that the best results were obtained from virus supplied from England and from the Almorah depôt in the North-Western Provinces. Mr. Elliott believes that, if the indent is received in time, the Vaccination Department in those Provinces is always ready to supply as much lymph as is required by applicants; its transport by post is easy and speedy, and no Civil Surgeon should therefore find any difficulty in providing himself, at the commencement of the vaccination season, with good and efficient virus with which to commence operations. A separate correspondence has recently passed on this subject, and Mr. Elliott does not therefore discuss it further ; but he trusts that next year's report will show not only a much smaller proportion of failures, but a much earlier successful establishment of vaccination for the season than that for 1881-82 shows for several districts. Increase to vaccinating staff. 11. Dr. Clarke again urges an increase to the vaccinating staff, the entertainment of a native superintendent or head vaccinator to supervise the ex-inoculators in Kámrúp (paragraph 19), of more vaccinators in the Gáro Hills (paragraph 17), and generally the introduction of the &quot;circle&quot; system of vaccination, where it is found possible to carry it out.

ANNUAL VACCINATION REPORT OF THE PROVINCE OF ASSAM FOR THE Year 1883-84. BY A. ETESON, M.D., DEPUTY-SURGEON-GENERAL AND SANITARY COMMISSIONER. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] SHILLONG: PRINTED AT THE ASSAM SECRETARIAT PRESS. 1884.
No. 3868. FROM A. ETESON, M.D., Deputy-Surgeon-General, Eastern Frontier District, and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam, To THE SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER OF ASSAM. Dated Shillong, the 12th July 1884. SIR, I HAVE the honour to forward, for submission to the Chief Commissioner, the Report on Vaccination in the Province of Assam for the season 1883-84. 2. It is gratifying to find that the marked progress of recent years has continued; and that the great personal interest taken in the department by Dr. Clarke, late Sanitary Commissioner, and the increased funds, allotted under the liberality and, fostering attention of the Administration, are being rewarded by the healthy growth and spread of vaccination in nearly every district of Assam. 3. It only remains for the Local Boards and Municipalities to follow the lead thus wisely given to them by Government, and also that the medical staff should take care their operations are successful both in word and deed. 4. At present, the chief difficulty appears to be in the belief among the common people that vaccination is not so protective as inoculation. With more careful inspection that results are genuine in both present and past years, such a belief will ultimately be dispelled; and Assam, otherwise, offers few obstacles to material progress in vaccina- tion. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient Servant, A. ETESON, M.D., Deputy-Surgeon-General and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam.
REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE PROVINCE OF ASSAM FOR THE YEAR 1883-84. Plan of the report. 1. The report is prepared in accordance with the system adopted in previous years. First, a series of tables are introduced showing the work as it is distributed, its general results, and expenditure. Second, a brief review of the district operations as obtained from medical officers in their annual reports. Third, the general statistics of the year throughout the Province. Source and character of the lymph em- ployed. 2. The supply of lymph was, as usual, obtained from many sources, and of variable quality. The English lymph, obtained on indent through the Sanitary Commissioner with the Government of India, was a limited supply, intended only to assist Civil Surgeons to begin work. In this respect it was not generally successful. In the Gáro Hills 10 tubes failed to produce a single vesicle. At Gauháti 10 operations produced three vesicles, but these were very good ones. At Nowgong 7 tubes of English lymph all failed. At Lakhimpur the record was lost. At Cachar 8 tubes English lymph entirely failed both with the Civil Surgeon and other medical men in the district. Bovine lymph not successful. 3. Similarly, bovine lymph obtained from the Bombay and Bengal Sanitary Departments was unsuccessful with very few exceptions. Darjiling, Punjab, Almora supply. 4. Of lymph supplied from the depôts at Darjiling and Almora, the former was unreliable; the latter very good. In a general way, both vaccinators and ex-inoculators prefer beginning with a macerated crust and afterwards with armed points or from arm to arm. Attempts to maintain local lymph not successful. 5. Attempts were made, both last year and this, to store lymph locally; but I do not recommend its adoption. It is less likely to produce a healthy pock than a fresh importation from regular depôts in another province. Vernacular instructions to operators, Appendix A. 6. Appendix A, which follows this report, is a reprint of the instructions to vacci- nators prescribed by the order of the Privy Council, 29th July 1871. Vernacular translations in Bengali and Assamese will as usual be issued to Civil Surgeons for the next season. Total results of vaccination during the season 7. In Appendix B, Annual Statement III., the vaccination of the Province during the season by the different classes of operators is fully illustrated. Dealing with the figures only, the results are a very great advance on any statistics of the Province previously recorded, and it is especially satisfactory in being now the third year in succession in which such marked success has occurred. Comparison of results with previous years. 8. The increase of 1881-82 was 87.2 per cent. over the figures of 1880-81. In 1882-83 there were 12,593 vaccinations (paragraph 7) more than in 1881-82, equal to 27.8 per cent.; and now for 1883-84, 88,693 total vaccinations have been performed, being an advance of 53.4 per cent. on the figures of 1882-83, and an advance of 267.1 per cent. on the totals of only four years ago. Details of the season's work further exam- ined. 9. Statement III., Appendix B, also shows in detail the work of each district, and the establishment by whom it was performed. With respect to the district work, a review of each annual report will be given, showing the total increase and decrease of the year. Agency employed in 1883-84. 10. The provincial vaccination establishment for 1883-84 numbered 170 altogether, being 12 more than in 1882-83, but 8 less than in 1881-82. The average work done by each operator was 460.9 opera-
2 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. tions; but this figure is subject to great variation, some of the municipal vaccinators and ex-inoculators having an extremely low return. Statistics of work in the tea-gardens. 11. Vaccination in the tea-gardens has made considerable advance. In 1882-83 statistics of 2,243 operations, and 1,746 successful, were submitted. This year the total recorded reaches 10,336, and it is probable that one-third at least of the gardens in Cachar and Nowgong have not been taken into account. Of the 10,336 operations, only 5,300 are stated to have been successful, an average of 51.2 per cent. As the same lymph was used with the coolies as for the district generally, I infer that inspection on tea-gardens is more complete, and that the higher ratio outside means deficient inspection. In Barpeta sub-division, where ex-inoculators work with no one to look after them, they have simply returned every operation as successful. Statistics of the Province. 12. Including the tea-gardens, the number of operations for the season for the whole Province was, as before stated, 88,693; of this total, 88,123 were primary, with 76,368 successful, equal to 86.66 per cent. There were 570 re-vaccinations only, of which 421 were successful, equal to 73.86 per cent. Statistics excluding tea-gardens. 13. Excluding tea-gardens, the primary vaccinations by Government agency totalled 77,787, with 71,068 successful and a ratio of 91.36 per cent. It is impossible not to suspect these results are wrong. The tea-gardens average is 51.2 only; the Government operators return 91.36. In 1882-83 the figures were 89.6, and in 1881-82 88.7. Dr. Macnamara considers vaccination on tea-gardens by the &quot;Doctor Babu&quot; are &quot;illusory;&quot; on the other hand, there are numbers of the gardens under direct European medical inspection, and the returns have probably been submitted by the latter. Again, the tendency of illusory returns is to be favourable, as witness the Barpeta ex-inoculators. I believe the ratio of successes recorded by Government operators is much too high, by which it is to be understood many operations are recorded as successful which subsequent vaccination or even ocular inspection would demonstrate to be unprotective. Statistics of preceding decade. 14. Appendix C illustrates the progress of vaccination in the Province since 1874-75. As the present year concludes a ten-year series of this table, it will be convenient in future to begin a fresh series. The present table will be consolidated into an average of ten years, the figures of the preceding year entered, and those of the current season: REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. 3 year. Except Assistant-Surgeon Hari Charan Sen, at Jorhát, who has medical charge of the station and dispensary, neither of the others can do more than temporarily assist, as their duty is concerned with immigration. Sylhet has two native Superintendents of Vaccination, Goálpára and Kámrúp each one. Three other districts, Cachar, Darrang, and Lakhimpur have developed to a standard for which a Superintendent is required. The various classes of vaccinators, Government, Local, and Municipal, show a moderate but a satisfactory increase. Ex-inoculators have again risen from 48 to 51: of these 35 are employed in Kámrúp, and 12 of these in Barpeta sub-division, where their work is never inspected. Calling to mind the Chief Commissioner's views on this subject published in paragraph 6 of the Resolution on vaccination operations in Assam for 1881-82, the Civil Surgeon should certainly not have authorised their employ- ment ; and in future the rule will be strictly observed that &quot; such agency is to be wholly abandoned, where their work cannot be thoroughly tested.&quot; In Goálpára, the numbers have been reduced from 16 to 9, but the same rule must be applied there ; and in Sibságar and Sylhet, where, also, they are still employed in insignificant numbers.

The work which has been carried on during the past season among the labourers of all classes on the Assam tea-gardens is shown in the above table. Statistics are yet defective. Results as received. 25. It has elsewhere been explained that the statistics enumerated above do not comprise all that has been done; returns are said to be disliked by the managers; and probably from one-third of the gardens answers have not been received. The figures represent a very great advance on those of last year. The total vaccinations on tea-gardens by private agency in the season 1882-83 was only 2,243, with 1,746 deemed successful, and 2,735 with 2,445 by Government employés. This year the returns state that 10,336 persons were vaccinated by garden agency alone, but with only 5,300 successful, equal to 51 per cent. On the other hand, the vaccina- tions by Government servants were 4,814 with 3,738 successful, a proportion of 77.6. Ratio of successes very low. 26. As no reports accompany the tabular returns received from garden managers, I cannot explain the very low rate of successes entered. At Cachar there was mention of the English lymph having been reported useless, but I should say the want of success was probably due to inattention on the part of parents and the vaccinating officer combined. In the Annual Sanitary Report of the Province for this year mention is made of very inefficient vaccination which came under my personal observation in Sibságar. 27. There were thus 15,150 operations this year and 9,038 successful, against 4,978 and 4,191 of the last season: Civil Surgeons and others interested would do well to ascertain privately what were the difficulties which prevented a better average of successful operations, and I should be very glad if I can be of any assistance in removing them by private advice and supplies of good lymph.

The last table on the list details very minutely the total cost of the Pro- vincial vaccination establishment during the season. The cost to Government has been Rs. 5,512, to Local Funds Rs. 1,220, and to municipalities Rs. 482, total Rs. 7,214. In respect of the first item it was remarked by the Officiating Chief Commissioner in his review of last year's report (page 3) that10 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. year, except 1878-79 and 1881-82, with this disadvantage, however, that there was no district inspection owing to the Civil Surgeon's absence on field service and pressure of duty in the station. Statistics. 34. Of the 1,544 successful vaccinations, 66 were done by the Civil Surgeon, 1,417 by the dispensary vaccinators, and 61 by Hospital-Assistants. There are no ex-inoculators employed; and according to the report the practice is unknown; neither were any outbreaks of small-pox recorded. 35. The area selected for the season was between the towns of Jaintia and Nongiri. The people generally were not averse to vaccination, but the operators met with tiresome delays either from the whim of a local chief, or pleas of bad weather, or the obstructions of divination. The Civil Surgeon considers the work done satisfactory; and probably it is so, taking into consideration the scattered villages and the above-mentioned obstacles. 36. There were 114 people of different ages vaccinated in Shillong. Within the Municipal area Act XIII. of 1880 is not in force. Protection afforded by the work of previous years is said to be considerable. I advise thorough inspection of the work done in previous years to ascertain individually, by the present condition of the scars, whether the protection is sufficient. 37. The supply of lymph was obtained from various sources and of various kinds: fresh calf lymph from Bombay, three distinct supplies of bovine lymph and crusts from Bengal, and vaccine lymph both from Bengal and the Punjab. Six of the seven supplies were found efficient. 38. The total cost in this district was Rs. 379-8, of which Rs. 288 for salary and Rs. 91-8 travelling allowances. The additional pay of Rs. 16 a month appears to have secured efficient trained vaccinators; but the average cost of each successful operation, viz., As. 4-3, should not be passed unnoticed. Every operator who does less than 1,000 successful cases in six months should give special explanation; inspection should be arranged for the district as well as for Shillong. Small results of 1882-83 39. Gáro Hills.REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. 11 Evil consequences of spurious vaccination. small-pox was lately prevalent in their villages, and that its attacks were confined to those who had been vaccinated. Mr. McNaught would be doing a public service if he would take pains to ascertain what degree of truth there is in such a report and in tracing it to its source. Spurious vaccination is no protection, but is under all conditions an active injury to the cause. More- over, even good lymph may be an imperfect protection, if enough has not been absorbed, or if maturation has been interrupted. Inspecting officers should see not only the cases of the week, but also some who were vaccinated the year before; for from these genuine vaccination, and enough of it, as evidenced by a typical, depressed, and foveated scar, can be much more thoroughly diagnosed. The ex-inoculator is not to be employed again. Sources of lymph supply for the year. 44. The Tura lymph was obtained from three sources, viz., locally raised, fresh lymph from Dacca, lymph in tubes from Darjiling twice, and 10 tubes of English lymph from Shillong. The Dacca supply was excellent, and practically supplied the district. The two from Darjiling and England were not successful. 45. Nagá Hills.12 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. examine not only the current year's work, but also that of previous years, to see that the scars show genuine and sufficient protection. Work in the Immigration Depôt. 54. There is a sectional report given of vaccination performed among immi- grant coolies in the depôts. 671 operations were performed, but as these persons are not usually detained over 48 hours at Dhubri, the results are entirely unknown. It would be better to omit it en route; it is hard that coolie mothers and their babies should have this distress added to the discomforts of travel. Legislative interference should not be dis- cussed in the annual reports. 55. The Civil Surgeon presses the question of making vaccination compulsory; and the Deputy-Commissioner replies opposing his view. It is not advantageous to argue matters with such a wide bearing in local reports. Local opposition from bigotry, and its explanation. 56. There was much opposition met with in the Goálpára sub-division attributed to the influence of the Barpeta Shastras, and which I under- stand has not yet been removed. It is possible, however, that the prohibition did not originate with them. Mention is made in the report of small- pox having been rife at Sálpara and attributed to vaccination; and perhaps the Barpeta priests only issued their ban in response to a local appeal. Dr. Dobson, however, with praiseworthy energy, enquired into this outbreak, and is satisfied that small-pox appeared first, and that the vaccinators were summoned by the villagers to their relief. Many who were thereupon vaccinated certainly took the disease, but this was the con- sequence of earlier contagion. The expenses and average cost of each successful case. 57. The expenses of the establishment have been large, viz., Rs. 676; but the results have been gratifying: the average cost of each successful case performed by Government servants being a fraction over one anna, and if the ex-inoculators' work be included, the average cost is reduced to ten pies. Inoculation supposed to be disappearing in this district. 58. The Civil Surgeon is of opinion that inoculation is fast disappearing. Per- sonally he has not seen a single case, nor any marks except in the elders of a family. The vaccinators concur in this view, although such a sanguine statement is likely to be exaggerated, and, indeed, it is opposed to the opinion of the former Civil Surgeon given in the previous year; possibly the practice is disappearing in thánas which are closely searched by vaccinators, and is relegated to more outlying places. If this is so, vaccinators in accepting the responsibility of removing one protection, must see that the other which is substituted surpasses it in value; this can best be done by careful and genuine, rather than by nume- rous operations. Lymph supply. 59. The lymph was supplied by the Sanitary Commissioners of Assam and Bengal, human and bovine, and in tubes and crusts. It was good throughout. Once the vesicle is established, the vaccinators kept up the supply without difficulty. Means to which the success of the year may be attributed. 60. I apprehend the excellent results of the year are due to the systematic training which the vaccinators learnt under Dr. Dobson's eye at the depôt in Dhubri, to the practical manner in which the work was planned, and to the diligence with which their returns were examined and the work inspected; the newly-appointed Superintendent of Vaccination is to be congratulated on the results. Much also due to interest and advice of the district officer. 61. I would also tender my acknowledgments to Lieutenant-Colonel Michell, Depu- ty-Commissioner, for his kindly interest in the work from beginning to end, for the support accorded to the subordi- nates in their labours, and especially for the intelligent review of the year's work which covers Dr. Dobson's annual report. Districts and staff. 62. Kámrúp.REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. 13 Barpeta sub-division. Work and statistics. 63. It will be convenient to review the work done at Barpeta first. Among the 13 operators there were only 1,430 successful cases. The Hospital- Assistant did 121 altogether, of which 116 were successful; the ex-inoculators 1,314, of which the Hospital-Assistant gravely reports&quot; all&quot; were successful. With leisure and overlooking the people always, it would not be out of the way to run 110 consecutive cases to a good termination as an isolated case; but that twelve indivi- duals working separately should all have avoided failure might have struck the mind of a Hospital-Assistant as absurd, and ought not to have been passed by the Civil Surgeon without reproof. Obstructions. 64. In this township it seems the inhabitants are of two religious persuasions, one of which permits vaccination and the other forbids it on penalty of heavy fine. The Hospital-Assistant is of opinion that inoculation is not so prevalent as formerly. Ex-inoculators only employed. 65. The ex-inoculators obtain their lymph from Gauháti, and work free of cost to Government. But cheap and spurious vaccination is not what is contemplated by Government, and these men should not be re-employed. On this subject the remarks of Dr. J. J. Clarke (paragraph 9) of last Vaccination Report, and the observations of the Officiating Chief Commissioner (paragraph 6) in his covering Resolution, on the necessity of closely inspecting and supervising the work of ex-inoculators, have not received local attention. Gauháti municipality and district statistics. 66. In respect of the sadr station of Gauháti the manner of work was fully described in last year's Vaccination Report, and need not be reproduced, as very little change has been introduced in the year now being reviewed. At Gauháti the staff was in full number 32, which includes 23 unpaid ex-inoculators. The total number of primary cases registered was 7,283, of which 6,866 were successful. In detail the Civil Surgeon had 45 operations, 39 and 86.6 per cent. successful; the Superintendent 81,72, and 88.8 per cent., two Hospital-Assistants 89, 82, and 92 per cent, one municipal vaccinator 143, 127, and 88.8 per cent., four Government paid vaccinators 2,866, 2,663, and 92.9 per cent, and 23 ex-inoculators 4,059, 3,883, and 95.66 per cent. respectively. The Government paid vaccinators averaged 718, the ex-inocu- lators 178, and the municipality man 147 operations. The first ought in a populous district like Kámrúp to show at least 1,000 successful cases each in six months; the small results shown by the municipal vaccinator were commented on last year. Dr. Mullane is advised to recommend his being replaced by a more efficient subordinate next season. Comparison with previous year. 67. The comparison with last year (5,677 and 4,513) is favourable, but the figures even with the Government staff alone, ought to reach a higher standard. The ratios of successful cases are all high, and, 3,786 having been verified by inspection, may be supposed correct. In the ensuing annual report the condition of protective marks of former years should be noted. Dr. Mullane inspected a páthsálá at Chaigáon, 26 miles from Gauháti, and found among 12 scholars, 5 protected by vaccination, 2 by inoculation, 2 by small-pox, and 3 not protected, rather a singular uniformity in so small a number. Expense of each case in town and district contrasted. 68. The cost of each successful operation in Kámrúp was 1 anna 5 pies to Govern- ment, and 15 annas I pie to the municipality, a contrast which might be fittingly brought to notice where Act XIII. of 1880 is supposed to be in force. Source of lymph. 69. The supply of lymph was obtained solely from the Sanitary Commissioner of Assam. The calf lymph failed entirely, but from the humanised lymph 10 operations were performed; of these three maturated and supplied, apparently, the whole of the subsequent vaccination. Work in local tea-gardens. 70. There is a small return of vaccination from tea-gardens in this district.

Nowgong.14 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. Staff at work in the district. 72. The operations are on a modest scale. Beside the Civil Surgeon, there are three dispensary vaccinators, two supported by Local Funds, and one Hospital-Assistant. Mr Driberg of opinion that the district should get a Superintendent, as the Civil Surgeon has too many other duties to enable him thoroughly to inspect the work being done by subordinates There is, no doubt, room for great improvement in the present indefinite way the work is carried on; and certainly the absence of efficient inspection leads to many irregularities, and is the cause of objections about the impotency of the protection afforded; an increase to the staff might reasonably be asked from the Local Funds under the Deputy-Commis- sioner's own guidance. Statistics of 1883-84. 73. The results of the year are satisfactory. From 1873-74 to 1880-81 the number of successful operations in this district barely averaged 180 per annum. In 1881-82 they rose, &quot;through steady determination and the cordial aid of district officers,&quot; to 1,310, in 1882-83 to 2,109, and in 1883-84 to 2,610. This is encouraging if the success is real. No ex-inoculators are employed, although from a remark in the report it would appear that some of this class work in the villages either with vaccinia or with variola, according to the fancies of the people. Proposed additions to staff for 1884-85. 74. I hope the authorities will succeed in raising the staff of vaccinators to 10, and have a Superintendent also. In this way the district can be mapped out carefully,' and if the vaccination performed is genuine and sufficient, the preference which, it is stated, the people now show for inoculation, on account of its decided individual protection, will disappear. Vaccination on tea-gardens not flourishing. 75. The work done on the tea-gardens is properly characterised as &quot;quite in- sufficient.&quot; The managers are under the impression that vaccination is general among unprotected coolies at Dhubri, but this is incorrect. Dr. Dobson states that 671 coolie children only were vaccinated there this year for all Assam, and that the results were not known. Taking a favourable estimate of 500 being successful, not more than 120 of them would be drafted into the Nowgong gardens. The figure of operations by tea-garden agency for the year was 69 successful out of 91 operations. The population of 22 gardens which furnished returns is entered at 4,933; but the Deputy-Commissioner considers there are at least 12,000 labourers employed. Managers should insist on the Medical Superintendent or subordinate in charge posting in October a requisition on the Civil Surgeon for a small supply of lymph tubes and crusts, and thereafter carrying on the work until March. Average cost of each case in the district 76. The cost of each successful vaccination is unusually high, viz., 3 annas 1 pie for the district staff; the permanent vaccinator's average being nearly twice that of the temporary. He is credited with 569, and the extra men with less than 400 successful cases. This is a poor average of the season. Supplies of lymph and crusts. 77. The supply of lymph was the same as in other districts. The English lymph failed; the supplies of human and bovine lymph from Bengal were not reliable. The best store came from the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, North-Western Provinces. General observations 78. The closing remarks of the late Mr. Hughes are valuable, as it is likely few medical officers in Assam were better acquainted with the people:REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. 15 Provinces, to the post. He obtained supplies of excellent lymph privately from the North-Western Provinces, and is able to report highly of the quality of the work performed. Favourable results at Tezpur. 82. The results are very favourable. Dr. Campbell himself vaccinated 892 times, with 848 successful results, being an average of 95 per cent., and the two dispensary vaccinators, who had been carefully trained by him and supplied with lymph of an established quality, operated 2,507 times and 2,383 successful, being an exactly similar average. The local vaccinator showed 861 and 772 successful, average 89.66. As Dr. Campbell inspected over 1,000 cases and with an average success of 95 per cent. nearly, these statistics appear reliable, and are gratifying. Results at Mangaldai. 83. In Mangaldai the vaccinators were not so energetic. The Hospital-Assistant succeeded in 124 cases out of 135, and the two vaccinators in 679 out of 787, being an average of 86.27. The results are not good, and the excuse of the unwillingness of the people must be understood as implying previous inefficient operations. The explanation here, and elsewhere, is that without efficient superintendence bad vaccination is the cause of numerous complaints from the people. The Civil Surgeon truly remarks that &quot; inefficient work only retards the advance of vaccination.&quot; Inoculation not common in Darrang. 84. The report states that inoculation goes on in this district &quot; to a very small extent, or not at all;&quot; and that in no instance has an out- break of small-pox been traced to have originated in the practice; but this is negative evidence only, and is not supported by the mortuary statistics, for small-pox prevailed nearly everywhere, although it was never bad in and about Tezpur &quot; where most of the children had been successfully vaccinated.&quot; Localities within and without operative influence. 85. At present, protection has been chiefly given to Tezpur and its vicinity, the work spreading outwards, and each village being thoroughly searched; but both Bishnath and the eastern portions have had little or no vaccination. Sources of lymph supply. 86. Lymph was obtained from three sources, viz., from the Sanitary Commissioners of Assam and the North-Western Provinces and four tubes of calf lymph from Bengal. The two first were very good, but the latter was here (and elsewhere) an entire failure. Expenses of the year. 87. The cost of the establishment at Tezpur is not great, viz., Rs. 386, and the average of each successful operation, 1 anna 11 pies, is also moderate. At Mangaldai the average cost is no less than 6 annas 6 pies. Vaccination Act not anywhere in force 88. Vaccination is nowhere compulsory in Darrang. In the opinion of the Civil Surgeon, no one would object to its being made so. Work on the tea-gardens 89. The report of work on the tea-gardens is unsatisfactory. Only 110 operations are recorded from Tezpur, of which 103 were successful; and all of them were performed by the Civil Surgeon him- self. At Mangaldai 114 cases were done by the vaccinators. Review by the Deputy-Commissioner. 90. Dr. Campbell's report is forwarded under a review by Mr. Williams, the Deputy- Commissioner. He is of opinion that objections against vaccination are gradually disappearing, especially among the lower classes, and he entirely concurs in the Civil Surgeon's view that complaints are chiefly due to inadequate protection. I doubt if the quality of the lymph has so much to do with non-protection as is generally supposed. The greatest proportion of failure is due to a healthy pustule never maturating thoroughly. I am convinced that if children of one year were examined the following year, the inspecting officer, judging by the cicatrices alone, would certainly reject a great proportion of them as unprotected. Wide scope for spread of vaccination in Darrang if staff is increased 91. In Darrang there is room for wide extension of vaccination: all the conditions are favourable; the people are not unwilling; there is little or no inoculation; the Civil Surgeon brings experience and great energy to the task; the civil authorities do not withhold encouragement and expla- nation from the people. If the Local Boards will aid by a larger grant for the ensuing year, so that a Superintendent on Rs. 25 a month and four temporary vaccinators on Rs. 10 a month may be trained and sent, two to Bishnath and two to Sotiah, I feel sure the results would be still more encouraging, not by increased numbers only, but chiefly because under Dr. Campbell's energy and watchful care the vaccination would be both genuine and ample for protection.

I was present while many of the operations were performed. Altogether about 50 Mishmi adults were vaccinated.&quot; (G. Godfrey, Deputy-Commissioner.) Lymph supply. 115. The supply of lymph was obtained from the Sanitary Commissioner, Assam, and from the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners, Bengal and North-Western Provinces. The Darjiling stock was a failure, one supply of bovine lymph succeeded in every instance. Return for the year highly meritorious. 116. Sylhet.REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. 19 of the tubes received from the Sanitary Commissioner, Bengal, contained lymph which for some reason or other could not be blown out of them. I thought they may have been put aside for some time before being sealed, and that the lymph dried in consequence. On the whole, the lymph received took well. The supply was kept up by ' arm-to-arm' vaccination when possible, but ' house-to-house' vaccination was practised in the majority of cases, the lymph being conveyed in capillary tubes, which are especially valuable where caste prejudices are strong.&quot; Staff of operators. 118. The staff comprised the Civil Surgeon, the Native Superintendent, and Assist- ant-Superintendent of Vaccination, ten Government, one municipal, eleven Local Fund vaccinators, five Hospital- Assisants, three ex-inoculators, and two compounders: all worked well. Below is the table of results of each:20 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. Statistics of the year. Low rates of successes. 125. The number of operations recorded was 5,073, of which 3,926 were successful. This is a ratio of 77 per cent., and is undoubtedly a low proportion. In 1882-83 the figures given were 4,688, 4,266, and 90 per cent. respectively. The reason assigned for so small a ratio is that the lymph in tubes as first supplied failed generally, not only when used by the Govern- ment operators, but also in the hands of the medical men and private practitioners on the tea-gardens. It was only with crusts received later that good lymph was established. Results of' a special examination as to protection enjoyed by civil population. 126. Dr. Monteath gives a table showing the protection variously afforded among three classes of the population who were examined, viz., prisoners, dispensary patients, and school-boys. It is given below:REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. 21 APPENDIX A. INSTRUCTIONS FOR VACCINATORS. (Prescribed by the Order of the Privy Council, 29th July 1871.) 1. Except so far as any immediate danger of small-pox may require, vaccinate only subjects who are in good health. As regards infants, ascertain that there is not any febrile state, nor any irritation of the bowels, nor any unhealthy state of skin; especially no chafing or eczema behind the ears, or in the groin, or elsewhere in folds of skin. Do not, except of necessity, vaccinate in cases where there has been recent exposure to the infection of measles or scarlatina, nor where erysipelas is prevailing in or about the place of residence. 2. In all ordinary cases of primary vaccination, if you vaccinate by separate punctures, make such punctures as will produce at least four separate good-sized vesicles, not less than half an inch from one another; or, if you vaccinate otherwise than by separate punctures, take care to produce local effects equal to those just mentioned. 3. Direct care to be taken for keeping the vesicles uninjured during their progress, and for avoiding afterwards the premature removal of the crusts. 4. Enter all cases in your Register on the day when you vaccinate them, and with all particulars required in the Register up to column 9, inclusive. Enter the results on the day of inspection. Never enter any results which have not been inspected by yourself or your legally-qualified deputy. In cases of primary vaccination, register as &quot; successful&quot; only those cases in which the normal vaccine vesicle has been produced; in cases of re-vaccination, register as &quot; successful&quot; only those cases in which either vesicles, normal or modified, or papules surrounded by areolæ, have resulted. When the vaccination of an unsuccessful case is repeated, it should be entered as a fresh case in the register. 5. Endeavour to maintain in your district such a succession of cases as will enable you uniformly to vaccinate with liquid lymph directly from arm to arm; and do not, under ordinary circumstances, adopt any other method of vaccinating. To provide against emergencies, always have in reserve some stored lymph; either dry, as on thickly-charged ivory points constantly well protected from damp, or liquid, in fine, short, uniformly capillary (not bulbed) tubes, hermetically sealed at both extremities. Lymph, successfully preserved by either of these methods, may be used without definite restriction as to time; but with all stored lymph caution is necessary, lest in time it have become inert, or otherwise unfit for use. If, in order to vaccinate with recent liquid lymph, you convey it from case to case otherwise than in hermetically-sealed capillary tubes, do not ever let more than eight hours intervene before it is used. 6. Consider yourself strictly responsible for the quality of whatever lymph you use or furnish for vaccination. Never either use or furnish lymph which has in it any, even the slightest, admixture of blood. In storing lymph, be careful to keep separate the charges obtained from different subjects, and to affix to each set of charges the name, or the number in your register, of the subject from whom the lymph was derived. Keep such note of all supplies of lymph which you use or furnish as will always enable you, in any case of complaint, to identify the origin of the lymph. 7. Never take lymph from cases of re-vaccination. Take lymph only from subjects who are in good health, and, as far as you can ascertain, of healthy parentage; preferring children whose families are known to you, and who have elder brothers or sisters of undoubted healthiness. Always carefully examine the subject as to any existing skin disease, and specially as to any signs of hereditary syphilis. Take lymph only from well-characterised uninjured vesicles. Take it (as may be done in all regular cases on the day week after vaccination) at the stage when the vesicles are fully-formed and plump, but when there is no perceptible commencement of areolæ. Open the vesicles with scrupulous care to avoid drawing blood. Take no lymph which, as it issues from the vesicle, is not perfectly clear and trans- parent, or is at all thin and watery. From such a vesicle as vaccination by puncture commonly produces, do not, under ordinary circumstances, take more lymph than will suffice for the immediate vaccination of five subjects, or for the charging of seven ivory points, or for the filling of three capillary tubes; and from larger or smaller vesicles take only in like proportion to their size. Never squeeze or drain any vesicle. Be careful never to transfer blood from the subject you vaccinate to the subject from whom you take lymph. 8. Scrupulously observe in your inspections every sign which tests the efficiency and purity of your lymph. Note any case wherein the vaccine vesicle is unduly hastened or otherwise irregular in its development, or wherein any undue local irritation arises ; and, if similar results ensue in other cases, vaccinated with the same lymph, desist at once from employing it. Consider that your lymph ought to be changed, if your cases, at the usual time of inspection on the day week after vaccination, have not, as a rule, their vesicles entirely free from areolæ. 9. Keep in good condition the lancets or other instruments which you use for vaccinating, and do not use them for other surgical operations. When you vaccinate, have water and a napkin at your side, with which invariably to cleanse your instrument after one operation before proceeding to another.

APPENDIX C.Resolution on the Assam Vaccination Report for 1883-84. Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner of Assam in the General Department, No. 6,036, dated Shillong, the 18th September 1884. READ( 2 ) departmental agency; the exact ratio was 33 per cent. in 1882-83 and 32 per cent. in 1883-84. The number of inspections (25,090 against 18,021 in 1882-83) is very evenly divided between Civil Surgeons and Native Superintendents (12,310 by the former, and 12,780 by the latter), but the results arrived at by these two classes of officers are widely different, the former finding 85 per cent. of the operations successful, and the latter 95 per cent. Nearly half of the inspection work done by Native Superintendents was in the district of Sylhet, where the percentage of successful cases is shown as 99.6. Work of this kind is obviously untrustworthy, and suggests a doubt whether the inspecting officer is really able to distinguish a successful operation from a failure. Secondary operations. 6. Secondary operations were only 570 in number, all performed by Government agency. The number returned as successful was 421, and the proportion 73.8 per cent. Vaccinating staff. 7. The agency by which the department worked in 1882-83 and 1883-84, and the total number of operations performed by each class of officers, are detailed in the following table:( 3 ) 1882-83. 1883-84.

The number of vaccinators maintained by municipalities, towns, and stations, is shown in the margin. The addition of two vaccinators has been followed by an increase of only 187 in the number of operations, and the average per man has fallen from 325 to 248, being highest in Sibságar (369), and lowest in Gauháti (147). The number of municipal vaccinators in Sylhet and Gauháti, however, is stated differently in the municipal administration reports of these places, i.e., two vaccinators to each municipality, and this discrepancy will have to be enquired into.

Sylhet was the first district to set the example of paying vaccinators out of Local Funds, and its example has been followed in 1883-84 by five other districts. The work done by the 20 vaccinators thus employed is such that the Local Boards have had full value for their money; the total number of operations was 15,219, and the average per operator was 761: in the South Sylhet sub- division it stood as high as 1,021. The lowest averages are in Habiganj (337) and Nowgong (379). The figures in the margin show the number of Local Fund vaccinators employed in 1883-84, according to Dr. Eteson, but there are several discrepancies between his returns and the Local Boards' annual reports, the latter showing expenditure on vaccination where the former show none, and vice versa. The following is a list of such instances :( 4 ) The Chief Commissioner insists that his orders on this subject shall be attended to, and a special explanation will be called for from the Deputy-Commissioner of Kámrúp and the Civil Surgeon of Gauháti. No change in the number of ex-inoculators in any district must be made without the previous sanction of the Sanitary Commissioner, and the work done by the men employed must be so far tested as to afford some guarantee that their operations are really protective, and are not, as here in Kámrúp, calculated by their ineffectiveness to discredit vaccination in the eyes of the people. The number of ex-inoculators in the other districts is not large enough to call for special comment. Vaccination on tea-gardens. 11. The returns of vaccination work performed among tea-garden coolies, whether by Government operators or by the medical officers employ- ed on the gardens, appear as follows- for 1882-83 and 1883-84:( 5 ) vaccinators for Sylhet district were sanctioned. It would be convenient if the report contained a reference to all Government orders sanctioning an increase on the budget allot- ments. Dr. Eteson says that the sum sanctioned by Government for vaccinators' pay was Rs. 4,689, but Rs. 550 of this remained unutilised, and he conjectures that the reason was the inability of Civil Surgeons to get together their full quota of temporary vaccinators at the beginning of the season. This is a point on which definite informa- tion should be afforded in next year's report. Permanent versus temporary vaccinators 13. The Civil Surgeon and the Deputy-Commissioner of Sylhet concur in repre- senting the disadvantages attending the employment of temporary vaccinators, the difficulty of beginning the season with a full staff, the inferiority of the work done by unpractised men, and their want of familiarity with the people among whom they are sent. The difference of cost between permanent and temporary pay, however, is too great to permit of any general change being made in the present system of recruiting the vaccinating staff. It does not follow that because men are only employed for a season of the year, different men should be employed each year. In other provinces where the same. system is followed, the vaccinators go to their homes for the recess, and return to their duties in the cold weather. The Chief Commissioner sees no reason why it should be impossible to obtain vaccinators on the same terms in Assam. Increase in the number of vaccinators. 14. In two districts an increase in the number of vaccinators is proposed. The Nowgong Local Board wish to raise the number from three to ten, and Dr. Eteson proposes an addition of four Local Fund vaccinators to the four Government vaccinators of Darrang. For both districts, also, a Native Superintendent on Rs. 25 a month is said to be wanted. The Chief Commissioner is willing to provide the Superintendent out of provincial revenues whenever the number of vaccinators is sufficient to require such supervision, but he thinks that the increase in the number of vaccinators in plains districts should ordinarily be provided for out of the funds of the Local Boards. and he is glad to record that the Local Boards have shared this view, and have responded in a most satisfactory manner to his suggestions. In the budget for 1884-85 provision is made for the entertainment of vaccinators by 18 out of the 19 Local Boards in the Province, and in the case of the missing one, South Sylhet, some mistake seems to have occurred, for it had 3 vaccinators in 1883-84 and presumably did not intend to reduce them. The total number provided for in the budgets of 1884-85 is 33. Cost of each operation. 15. Including the work done by the unpaid agency of ex-inoculators, the average cost of each successful operation, whether primary or secondary, was 1½ anna: last year it was 1¼ anna. Excluding operations by ex-inoculators, these averages rise to 13/4 and 1½ anna respectively. Supply of lymph. 16. The reports of the failure of attempts to vaccinate by reason of the badness of the lymph continue to be discouraging, and the cause requires careful investigation, for the Chief Commissioner believes that in other Provinces no such difficulties are experienced. It is partly due, in all probability, to the ignorance of the vaccinators, who cannot distinguish bad lymph from good: and the evil done by the use of bad lymph is wide and far reaching, both in the discouragement it produces when the subject is found to be unprotected from small-pox, and in the discomfort and suffering caused by the sores which result from it. A remark- able instance of this latter evil came under Dr. Eteson's own observation, and is narrated in paragraph 82 of his Sanitary Report. No great success attended the attempts made in 1883-84 to renew the supply of lymph by import from other Provinces and from England. The English lymph proved an almost total failure, and bovine lymph sent from Bengal and Bombay did no better. The best lymph came from Almora. Compulsory vaccination. 17. Dr.Eteson remarks that the Compulsory Vaccination Act has hitherto been practically a dead letter in Assam. It is in force only in the municipalities of Sylhet, Gauháti, and Dibrugarh, and in Dibrugarh cantonment, and the work done in the three municipalities in 1883-84. as compared with the population, is shown below. These figures are taken from the municipal Administration Reports, and include all vaccinations performed within municipal limits, whether by municipal vaccinators or others :( 6 ) Dr. Eteson remarks that mention is nowhere made of any officials who are responsible for the carrying out of the Act. The Sylhet and Dibrugarh rules, however, state very plainly who is responsible. The Hospital-Assistant in charge of the dispen- sary is the Superintendent of Vaccination, under the direct orders of the Civil Surgeon; he keeps the register of unprotected children, issues notices to parents and guardians, and institutes prosecutions under the Act if they neglect to have the child vaccinated within a week. The Gauháti rules are less detailed, but the same duties and responsi- bilities devolve on the Hospital-Assistant of the dispensary here also, in virtue of his function as Superintendent of Vaccination in the municipal circle. If, therefore, there is any failure to enforce the Act (and the figures quoted above certainly suggest such a suspicion), it can only arise from a neglect of the plain provisions of the rules, and Civil Surgeons can easily satisfy themselves whether this is the case or not. A special section upon the working of the Act in the three municipalities and in the cantonment of Dibrugarh should be appended to the Report for 1884-85, showing the number of vaccinations, the number of children on the registers, and the extent to which protection has been carried since the Act has been in force. The number of prosecutions under the Act should also be ascertained from Deputy-Commissioners, and recorded in this section. In the Sylhet Administration Report mention is made of 64 cases in which notices were issued under Section 18 of the Act on parents and guardians who omitted to vaccinate their child- ren ; but those notices were only issued at the close of the year under report. Attitude of the people towards vaccina- tion. 18. The district officers, whose reports are summarised by Dr. Eteson, consider that, though religious prejudices sometimes interfere, no active opposition to vaccination exists generally among the people of Assam. It is stated that the influence of the Barpeta Shastra was unfavourable in the Goálpára sub-division, and that in Barpeta itself one section of the Hindus was opposed to vaccination, while the other admits it. The sects here intended are doubtless the two sects known as Mahapurushias and Damo- darias, the former being hostile to vaccination, while the Damodarias are not. In the Jorhát sub-division, again, the reports state that there are communities who consider it inconsistent with their character as bhakats to be either vaccinated or inoculated even when epidemic small-pox is raging. But the general view is that the chief difficulty which vaccination in Assam has to overcome is the preference of the people for inoculation, a preference founded partly on old custom, and partly on a belief, which is, perhaps, not ill- grounded, that inoculation affords more certain protection. The Civil Surgeon of Sylhet writes:( 7 ) ber of operations was the result: but the Chief Commissioner has since heard that this letter was a fraud, and that the Goshain subsequently levied fines from those who relied on it. No Deputy-Commissioner, no Government officer, wields half the authority or power which these saintly personages possess. They make progresses through the districts with semi- regal state, are attended by crowds of followers, are paid by the contributions of the villa- gers,.levy dues through their subordinate officials who are spread over the country, and hold courts of enquiry, at which reports are received of all lapses from the religious ordinances which govern social life, and punishment is inflicted. Mr. Elliott in the last winter received a graphic account from an old mauzadar, who was not apparently lying, of what he him- self had witnessed when one of these Goshains came to a village where one of his disciples had violated the anti-vaccination ordinance: how his followers seized hold of the man, and in the Goshain's, presence, and by his orders, beat him till they were tired, and then levied a fine of Rs. 40: No complaint has ever been made in the criminal courts of these acts of violence and exaction. Large sections of the community are no doubt free from this religious subjection, and it is among them that vaccination makes progress: but among the classes higher in the social scale it can make little advance till some means are found of diverting the opposition of the Goshains, or till the superstitious veneration in which they are held melts away. District reports. 19. The table given in paragraph 2 of this review affords a comparative view of the work done in all the districts of the Province. Sylhet shows by far the largest number of operations, and the development of vaccination work from 1,948 operations in 1881-82 to 23,241 in 1883-84 reflects high credit upon Dr. Macnamara, as well as upon the Deputy-Commissioner and the sub-divisional officers. Dr. Macnamara, however, takes too favourable a view of the quality of the work done by the vaccinators, and had his inspections extended over 1,500 or 2.000 cases, instead of 281 only, he would probably have found a smaller proportion of successful cases than 90 per cent. What is wanted in Sylhet is closer supervision of the large staff of vaccinators now at work. Cachar.( 8 ) in 1882-83, and has only risen to 3,606 in the year under report. There are three Government vaccinators, two municipal vaccinators (Sibságar and Golághát), and one man paid from Local Funds; and these six men performed only 3,064 operations between them, or one-half the number that the Government has a right to expect. There are three ex-inoculators, who performed 323 operations. and ought to be got rid of. The Chief Commissioner trusts that Dr. Partridge will give his particular attention to vaccination during the coming season, and expects the district officers to co-operate with him towards ensuring a better outturn of work in 1884-85. There are to be four vaccinators entertained by the Local Boards in the next season. Lakhimpur.ANNUAL VACCINATION REPORT OF THE PROVINCE OF ASSAM FOR THE Year 1884-85. BY A.

REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE PROVINCE OF ASSAM FOR THE YEAR 1884-85. Plan of the annual report. 1. The report is prepared in accordance with the plan adopted in previous years. First, a series of tables is introduced showing the distribution, expenditure, and general results; second, a review of the district operations; third, the general provincial statistics of the year. To these are added appendices of useful information and current topics of interest. Sources of the seasonal supply of lymph. English lymph. Quality variable. 2. The supply of lymph was, in the first instance, obtained from England on a general indent through the Sanitary Commissioner with the Government of India. 200 tubes were required, but only 100 were sanctioned, owing to the small stock available, compared with the demand from India at large. The lymph arrived on the 23rd September 1884, and was immediately distributed to the several Civil Surgeons. This selected pure lymph is, of course, intended only to begin vaccination; and for this purpose special care should be taken to use it on particularly healthy infants, of four to eight months, to secure a properly developed and uninjured natural vesicle. The reports are by no means uniform as to the quality of this year's supply. From some districts it is said to have been very good, in others fair, and in others a failure. Its quality cannot be relied upon as uniform throughout, notwithstanding every care in its collection in England; but I cannot help thinking that the results are mostly proportionate to the care with which the first operations are performed and watched. Failure follows the matter being left to careless subordinates. In each district review will be found in detail the source of the supply, and its success or failure. Indian lymph. 3. Subsequently, each Civil Surgeon received, either by private communication or on periodical issue, lymph tubes from the Sanitary Commis- sioners of Bengal, the North-West Provinces, and Superin- tendents of Vaccination at Calcutta, Dacca, Darjeeling, Almorah, &c., and, generally speaking, the supply was reliable. In no particular of their duty is the value of a trained vaccinator so marked as in this point of maintaining a good and ample supply of lymph. In Assam the great majority of the operators have to be hastily trained and insufficiently inspected, with the result that they are either ignorant of the characteristics of true lymph or careless as to its quality. The narrative of Mr. McNaught's inspection, published in Appendix B, is, I fear, too common an example of what goes on in the Province generally. TABLE No. I.

Staff employed in Aasam. 4. In this table is entered the agency employed in each district and the class of operators. The Civil Surgeons remain practically the same from year to year. Dr. Cran, Civil Surgeon of North Lakhimpur, did no work this year. Only one Assistant-Surgeon, Hari Charan Sen, in medical charge of Nowgong, took any part in vaccination this season. At Dhubri and at Tezpur the Assistant-Surgeons have been relieved of vaccination in accordance with paragraph 19 of the Resolution of 1883-84. The number of Hospital-Assistants also remain practically the same ; the slight increase from 25 to 28 being due to new dis- pensaries in Sylhet and Nowgong. The latter district has had a native inspector for the first time (Chief Commissioner's No. 6,593, dated the 14th October 1884). I agree with Mr. McNaught's view that the title Native Superintendent is inappro- priate. The Civil Surgeon is the Superintendent of Vaccination in his district. The Government, or as I propose to term them, the Provincial vaccinators have been reduced from 45 to 42. This is due to three vaccinators in Goálpára who were paid last year by Government having been paid by the Local Fund in 1884-85 (Chief Commis- sioner's No. 5,350, dated the 17th October 1883). One vaccinator, who was sanctioned for six months, was not entertained, under a wrong impression (Civil Surgeon's No. 439, dated the 7th June 1885.) An additional vaccinator for Mauphlang in the Khási Hills- district was sanctioned (Chief Commissioner's No. 6,741, dated the 16th October 1884). A native inspector was also sanctioned for Darrang (Chief Commissioner's No. 7,737, dated the 22nd November 1884), but was not employed, as no competent man could be got. I strongly urge on Dr. Campbell the suggestion given by Mr. McNaught to ask for one from the Superintendent of Vaccination, Calcutta, in time for next season's opera- tions. The Municipal vaccinators received an addition of one each at Habiganj and Dibrugarh. The work of this class is unsatisfactory; neverthless, no municipality should be without one. If vaccination be not encouraged under the eye of education and authority, how can the ignorant and rude villagers accept it with confidence ? The most satisfactory feature of the table is the increase of Local Fund vaccinators from 20 to 40. Cachar, Sibságar, Darrang, Nowgong, Kámrúp, and Goálpára have all now followed the lead of Sylhet, and are making laudable efforts to accustom the people to vaccination and to depopularise inoculation. Hardly less satisfactory is the decrease of ex-inoculators from 51 in 1883-84 to 27 in 1884-85. In the review of both Goálpára and Kámrúp the services of these men are usefully sketched, and certain advantages claimed for their continued employment. It will be observed that Surgeon Dobson objects altogether to the term ex-inoculators, and would have them styled &quot; licensed private vaccinators.&quot; In the Calcutta and Darjeeling circles these men do all the district work, and are there styled &quot; licensed vaccinators.&quot; In Lakhimpur, however, the original term is shown to be still appropriate. The essential condition of their employment has been fairly observed (Chiet Commissioner's Resolution 1883-84, paragraph 10), and, so long as their numbers are with- in reasonable control and their work adequately supervised, they may be encouraged.. I think the term &quot;licensed vaccinator&quot; is suitable, and recommend its adoption. 5. Taken as a whole, the table shows there were 170 vaccinators of all classes last season, and 169 during the current season. TABLE No. II.

The extraor- dinary progress made in Nowgong is no doubt due in a great measure to the unflinching support given to the operators and the sustained energy and increased establishment fostered by Mr. J. J. S. Driberg, Deputy-Commissioner. I had myself the advantage of seeing his personal and practical interest in every detail of the system. After balancing the increase and decrease, there is a net advantage gained of 15,038 operations; and the total of the season is 103,731, or an advance of 14.5 per cent. on the 88,693 of 1883-84. The actual increase is, indeed, not quite half of what it was last year; but, taking into con- sideration that the working staff of 1883-84 was 170, compared with 158 of 1882-83, and that in 1884-85 it was only 169, there is no fault to be found with the rate of progress, except in Sylhet, where certainly it would appear there has been less zeal than heretofore.

In not a single district report has any Civil Surgeon favourably mentioned any subordinate. This is a great mistake. Proper pride and emulation ought to be encouraged, and this can be done easily by a few words of courteous acknowledgment from a superior. The average of all the Provincial vaccinators, 971, is very good indeed; and in Shillong and Tura they averaged 1,562 and 1,439 respectively. I feel some difficulty in accepting the very large proportion of work in the hills, where distances are so great and the population so few. In Sylhet the average for 10 operators was 1,083 each. Municipal vaccinators. 13. There were only eight municipal vaccinators, and they performed only 4,146 operations, with 3,679 successful, or 88.7 percent. Their aver- age is, therefore, only a trifle over 500 cases. Their work has been stigmatised as &quot;miserable&quot; in previous years; but certainly the figures of this season are double the average of last, and may, it is possible, continue to improve. Dhubri, with 923 cases and 881 successes, is an example of energy in even a municipal servant; and Sibságar, Gauháti, and Jorhát have also done well. Local Fund vaccinators. 14. There were 40 Local Fund vaccinators employed during the year, and their total work amounted to 26,486 cases and to 23,875 successes; the average is 662 and 597, or 90.18 per cent. On the whole, considering with what difficulty these men are recruited; that many of them do not begin work until late in the season, and are often unskilful, unknown, and uneducated, more cannot be expected. The highest proportion seems to have been reached in Nowgong, where 6 men worked 5,871 cases, and the lowest at Kohima, where a man is said to have performed 12 cases, with 9 successes, for which he drew Rs. 70 pay at Rs. 10 a month and Rs. 21-6-0 as travelling allowance. His average cost of each successful case is correctly given at Rs. 10-2-51 Ez-inoculators Gross total. 15. Lastly come the ex-inoculators, as they have been hitherto termed. By refer- ence to the tables of previous years, the number of these men has been greatly reduced. In 1881-82 in Kámrúp alone there were 76; this year there have been only 28, viz., 18 in Kámrúp, 8 in Goál pára, 1 in Sylhet, and 1 (apprentice) in the Gáro Hills. But their statistics have not diminished materially. In 1881-82 the numbers vaccinated by these men were 15,890, with 14,835 successful. Last season 51 men are said to have performed 13,069 operations, with 12,272 successes; this season 28 (practically 26) men performed 15,338 operations, with 14,417, or 93.99 per cent., successes. Notwithstanding all that both Dr. Mullane and Dr. Dobson urge in their favour, I should be glad to have them still further reduced. The outcome of all vaccination by State aid in Assam for the season 1884-85, i.e., exclusive of private tea-garden agency, is 94,699 primary opera- tions, with 86,914, or 91.78 per cent., successful; and 583 secondary, and 463, or 79.41 per cent., successful. In Mr. McNaught's memorandum will be found an allusion to the registration of vaccination being confused; and Dr. Macnamara admits that in Sylhet children are re-vaccinated until they &quot; take.&quot; It is not a matter of much moment; but so long as &quot;re-vaccination&quot; has separate columns for report, it is advisable the two classes should be kept as distinct as possible.

By Civil Surgeons. 17. Of the individual share taken in this part of the work, Surgeon E. Dobson at Goálpára has far surpassed all previous record. In 1883-84, Dr. Whitwell was a long way ahead with 3,301, but Dr. Dobson in 1884-85 shows 5,930. Sibságar, with 3,996, stands second on the list; but the inspection there is nearly all by subordinates. Dr. Whitwell stands third, with 2,604, in Lakhimpur. Mr. McNaught shows 1,903, Dr. Mullane 1,508, and Dr. Campbell 1,168. The small figure (154) for Nowgong is due to the inspection having been carried on by Assistant-Surgeon. Hari Charan Sen. In the Nága Hills, Surgeon Borah was absent on political tours with the Deputy-Commissioner; in the Khási Hills and at Cachar the military medical officer, being in collateral civil charge, could not leave the station even for a day. In Sylhet, Dr. Macnamara has improved his record from 281 in 1883-84 to 830 in 1884-85; but the figure is still much below what should be expected in a district which has by far the largest staff of operators and the most extensive vaccination of any. By Native Inspectors. 18. As yet, there are native inspectors in 4 only out of the 11 districts. Darrang, already sanctioned, will have one next year, and it is to be hoped an effort will be made, under paragraph 14 of the Chief Commissioner's Resolution of 1883-84, to obtain a native inspector each for Sibságar, Lakhimpur, and Cachar. But, with this improved and more expensive establishment, there must also be a better principle of inspection. It is not sufficient, as advanced by the Civil Surgeon of Sylhet, that the inspector should pronounce a case successful, merely because it has &quot;taken.&quot; It is surprising that such a view should be held for a moment. It means that the object of vaccination is less to protect the people against small-pox than to furnish plausible statistics and a favourable report; whereas the real purpose of inspection is to guard against the latter and to establish the former. 19. Elsewhere (paragraph 11) allusion is made to the appointment of inefficient men to be native inspectors on grounds other than public duty and merit. TABLE No. V.

The progress of vaccination on tea-gardens continues much the same as last year. The number of operations has fallen from 15,150 in 1883-84 to 11,939 in 1884-85; the proportion of successes varies from a maximum of 91.23 per cent. in Darrang to a minimum of 35.8 in Sylhet. No explanation is given in any of the annual reports; nor do the Civil Surgeons comment on them. One would have thought Dr. Macnamara, who has so much to say concerning his own proportion of successes, would at least be startled by the contrast between 35 among his neighbours and 97 of his own. The supply of lymph was presumably the same in both. The probable explanation is that very little is known of how the work proceeds; that the registers are kept imperfectly or not at all, and no monthly returns prepared. Consequently, when a seasonal report is asked for, it lapses for want of system. Last year 9,762 vaccinations were reported in Cachar alone, and this year only 4,868. The Deputy-Commissioner, in forwarding the annual report, again mentions the great difficulties experienced in obtaining any statistics from the garden managers; and the Deputy-Commissioner of Sylhet speaks of this also, and adds that &quot; the returns not being prescribed by law, no compulsion is possible.&quot; Omission from future reports desirable. 21. So long as vaccination on tea-gardens by private agency is permissible only, any statistics must be misleading, and it would, perhaps, be better to omit them altogether from the official report.

Expenditure. 22. In Table No. VI. is detailed the total cost of vacci- nation for the season. Sanctioned Budget allotment. 23. The sanctioned provincial establishment consisted of 5 native inspectors, 43 vaccinators, and 1 apprentice. The actual number engaged was 4, 42, and 1. It has already been explained why a native inspector in Darrang and a vaccinator in Goálpára were not employed. The pay varied; but the total amount came to Rs. 4,810; and of this sum Rs. 4,317 appears disbursed in salaries. The deficiency occurs mainly in the Gáro Hills district, and is owing to men not having been employed the whole period for which pay was sanctioned. Similarly, undrawn pay lapsed at Mauphláng, Dibrugarh, Golághát, Tezpur, Nowgong, and Dhubri. Beside the above sum in salaries, a total of Rs. 1,603 is chargeable to the Provincial Government as travelling allowances. It is observable that the items vary considerably. In Sylhet, Goálpára, Darrang, Kámrúp, Nowgong, and Sibságar the native inspectors alone draw travelling allowance, and the vaccinators none at all; in Lakhimpur the charge to Government is moderate; but in the three hills districts the amounts paid under this head is very large. Travelling allowance has a marked effect in raising the average value of. each successful operation from a maximum of Re. 1-1-3 at Kohima and 4 annas 10 pies at Shillong to a minimum of 1½ anna at Tura, Nowgong, Darrang, and Goálpára. Municipal charges. 24. The share of the expense taken by the municipalities remains still very trifling. One native inspector, with a remuneration of Rs. 150 for the season, is sanctioned at Sylhet; and eight others are distributed through the Province at Silchar, Habiganj, Sylhet, Dibrugarh, Jorhát, Sibságar, Gauháti, and Dhubri. The total cost in salaries was Rs. 831 only. Only two of the eight employés are permanent. The &quot;Municipality&quot; heading of this column includes sanctioned expenditure for vaccination by certain stations and unions also. In future, the budget allotment, both of this column and of Local Funds, will be given. In 1883-84 the total municipal expenditure was Rs. 482. Local Funds charges. 25. The Local Funds provided the pay of 40 vaccinators and one inspector. The cost was Rs. 2,434 in salaries, and Rs. 248 in travelling allowances; total Rs. 2,682. Last season the amount was Rs. 1,220 only. 26. Finally, the last three columns give the gross expense of the season Rs. 9,433, compared with Rs. 7,214 of 1883-84; the number of paid vaccinations 66,793, compared with 54,642 in 1883-84, and the average cost of each operation to be 2 annas 3 pies in 1884-85, compared with 2 annas 21/3 pies in 1883-84. If the number of unpaid operations by licensed vaccinators, by tea-garden private agency, Civil Surgeons, Assistant-Surgeons, Hospital-Assistants, and Compounders be included as heretofore, the gross total successful is 92,863, and the average cost 1 anna 7½ pies. Compulsory vaccination areas. 27. In accordance with the instructions of the Chief Commissioner's Resolution of 1883-84, paragraph 17, a special section is appended showing the working of the Compulsory Vaccination Act of 1880 in the three municipalities and in the cantonment of Dibrugarh where it is in force.

REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. 9 Statistics. At Gauháti. 28. The foregoing table condenses all the information which has been obtained. In Gauháti alone does there appear to have been proper attention paid from the beginning. The number of children said to be on the register (1,549) is actually the numbers which have been vaccinated in the three years. This is wrong. Every registered birth should be transferred to the register, and the appropriate column subsequently filled in when vaccination has been successfully performed. During the last season 66 notices were served on parents, 14 prosecutions instituted when these were disregarded, and in all either vaccination performed or a small fine levied. Dibrugarh. 29. At Dibrugarh the Act has apparently only come into force this last year. The register is imperfect. Vaccination was fairly general, being in a ratio corresponding to the population nearly equal to Gauháti, and the prosecutions and convictions nearly alike. Dibrugarh Cantonment. 30. In the Dibrugarh Cantonment the figures are insignificant. Sylhet 31. From Sylhet the Civil Surgeon writes10 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. my part the Sanitary Commissioner of Bengal has favoured me with a note on the way vaccination is carried on in that province. From this, it appears a very large proportion of the vaccinators receive pay during the recess, varying in amount from 50 to 75 per cent. of their working salary. The statement covers the districts of Darjeeling, Eastern Bengal, Behar, Sonthal Parganas, Orissa, and Ranchi. In Eastern Bengal, which offers the nearest example to Assam, there are 67 men who are paid for both terms, compared with 32 temporary vaccinatiors and 24 apprentices who are paid only for the season. In Behar 61 and in Orissa 31 men are paid all through the year, and none are employed temporarily. In Sonthalisthan there are 21 permanent and 24 temporary; in Ranchi 21 permanent and 19 temporary. In Darjeeling there are six permanent hands, and the rest is entrusted to licensed vaccinators. Proposed re-organization in Assam. 37. I recommend that a beginning should be made in this direction, and that sanction be accorded to half the provincial vaccinators in each district of Assam being graded as permanent, with two- thirds of their salary continued during the recess. It behoves the Government to set an example to local self-government, and to increase the budget expenditure with increased results. 38. The reduced supply of 100 tubes of English lymph, instead of 200 required by indent, has been a serious inconvenience to the early development of vaccination last season. GOÁLPÁRA. 39. This important district, second only to Sylhet in the amount of work done, has remained throughout the season under the careful superintendence of Surgeon Dobson. Reduced working staff. 40. The working staff was reduced from 24 in 1883-84 to 20 in 1884-85, owing to the Assistant-Surgeon not taking any share, to one Hospital- Assistant, one unpaid vaccinator, and one provincial vacci- nator, less this season. Important increase of the season; 41. The results are most encouraging. In 1882-83 the total reached 6,922, in 1883-84 14,474, in 1884-85 16,691. Of the latter figures 15,982, or 95.75 per cent, are reported to have been successful. There was no re-vaccination. The Civil Surgeon operated 23 times, with 82.60 per cent successful; the native superintendent 589 and 95.07; the provincial vaccinator 922 and 97.72; the municipal vaccinator 923 and 95.44; the 5 Local Fund vaccinators averaged 688 and 99.91; 3 Hospital-Assistants averaged 26 and 80.77; 8 unpaid vaccinators averaged 1,339 and 94.44. and inspection very searching and compre- hensive 42. These statistics are gratifying, because the inspection was more thorough and complete than in any other district. Dr. Dobson inspected 5,930 cases, and reports 93.18 per cent. of them to have been successful, while the native inspector saw 4,815, and reports 95.72 per cent., to be good. Everything, however, still depends on the standard of &quot; a success. &quot; The report seems to accept as sufficient that the vaccine has &quot; taken,&quot; and to count successful those who have broken pustules and even sores. Genuine protection essential to success. 42a. It cannot be too often or too strongly insisted upon that the standard of a successful operation is its protective efficiency, and that a vaccination which has not proceeded through a maturated pustule to a depressed foveated scar or scars covering an area the size of a four-anna piece is not held to be adequately protective. In this sense, I look with suspicion on all ratios claiming over 80 per cent. of success. No tea-gardens nor compulsory area 43. There are no tea-gardens of any extent in Goálpára and no vaccination reported; neither is any part of the district under the Compulsory Vaccination Act. Attitude of the people not favourable. 44. The people, as a rule, do not care for vaccination anywhere. The Deputy- Commissioner in forwarding the report states it is as unpopular as ever; and that without the aid of the police the operators would have no work. But there must, as Dr. Dobson writes, be some degrees of willingness; otherwise the resistance which, notwithstanding the police, is complete in and about Goálpára town would be general. Probably, a great deal of vaccination is now accepted &quot; faute de mieux; &quot; inoculators are getting scarce; they find themselves harassed, their work stopped, their occupation maligned, and the people take to vaccina- tion, not because it is preferred, but because they are getting nothing else. During this season Dr. Dobson found an inoculator working with a license given him by the old pensioned Hospital-Assistant of Goálpára, and he had already promoted 34 cases of small-
REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. 11 pox before he was found out. And then there is the question of a fee. The people may- or may not fee the Government vaccinators, but they must fee the private inoculators ; and this frequently amounts to extortion after a successful attendance in a well-to-do family. Small-pox was not either prevalent or very fatal. 45. The prevalence of small-pox during 1884 was very slight. Only 267 deaths in the whole district were registered, compared with 613 in 1883. Dr. Dobson gives a table of the mortality in each sub-divisional outpost. In Sidli, Salmara, Rungjuli, Fakiragram, and Bugribari vaccina- tion had not been allowed by the inhabitants in 1883-84 ; and in these outposts 250 out of the 285 deaths occurred. In Dhubri town, Agomoni, Jemadarhat, Sukchar, Manicachar, and Lakhipur, where there had been ample vaccination, not a single death was reported. In both 1883 and 1884 8 out of 23 outposts had no death ; on the other hand, Goálpára town, which is most obstructive, was also free of the disease. Among 11 deaths in Dhubri thána, 8 were imported cases among immigrants. Lymph generally good. 46. The supply of lymph was, on the whole, good; it was chiefly obtained from the Sanitary Commissioner of Bengal in periodical fresh supplies. Dr. Dobson states the vaccinators in his district work chiefly with crusts, because these are easily collected and carried; and parents object to arm-to-arm vaccination. His vaccinators also find it difficult to collect lymph in tubes, as the vesicle is ordinarily picked by the child. It is strange that in the neighbouring district of the Gáro Hills, Mr. McNaught, equally painstaking and observant, insists on arm-to-arm, ivory points, and tubes being essential to genuine vaccination. On my inspection tour in December 1884 I saw over 100 children in a large village near Manicachar, in nearly all of whom the vesicle was destroyed. I did not see five uninjured, and these were in the early stage, about the sixth day, and would probably be picked in the next twenty-four hours. Value of ex-inoculators' work considered. 47. The report deals very fully with the question of ex-inoculators, whose work has been repeatedly questioned, both as to genuine character and reliability of figures ; and the Chief Commisssoner's Resolu- tion on the Report of 1883-84, paragraph 10, passed positive orders that this class of operators are not to be employed unless they can be properly supervised. The number who were granted licenses in Goálpára during the present season was only 8, and they appear to have had that supervision which was conditional to their employment. Dr. Dobson unhesitatingly favours them under such circumstances. He writes12 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. Dr. Dobson and the working staff com- mended. 49. I have great pleasure in bringing to special notice the excellent work of the season by Surgeon E. Dobson and his subordinates. KÁMRÚP. District work and progress fairly good. 50. The annual report for this important district exhibits a fair amount of progress, especially when the reduction in the working staff is taken into consideration, but it is the only district which appears to have had more vaccination ten years ago than it has to-day. In 1875-76 the total number of vaccinations was 9,875; in 1876-77, 13,110; in 1877-78, the number fell to 7,857; in 1878-79 it rose to 13,206; in 1879-80, 12,099; in 1880-81 it again fell to 6,244; in 1881-82 it rose to 11,689; in 1882-83 fell again to 5,677; in 1883-84, 8,718; in 1884-85, 9,742. These fluctuations are explained by the employ- ment of ex-inoculators. At one time these numbered 70 in one season; and practically their returns were uninspected and unreliable. At present there are only 18. Careful preliminary preparation. No aid from either landowners or police. 51. Dr. Mullane began the season in the first week of October by preliminary successful operations in the municipality and on the Mundakata tea-garden with lymph obtained from the Sani- tary Commissioners of Assam and Bengal. The Hospital-Assistants, the old and new paid vaccinators, and the ex-inoculators received personal instruction, and when the supply of lymph had been locally established, each operator proceeded to district areas within which their work was ordered to be strictly confined. The mauzadars and the police in Kámrúp pay little heed to the vaccinators' parwanas, and give them no aid. Working staff. 52. There were in all 30 working staff, inclusive of 18 ex-inoculators; the Civil Surgeon, a native superintendent, or inspector, four provin- cial, one municipal, three local vaccinators, and two Hospital- Assistants were the others. Results. 53. The result of the season's work was 9,872 vaccinations, being 9,742 primary and 130 secondary operations. Of the former 89.84 per cent. and of the latter 88.46 per cent. are reported to have been successful. The average work of each man is a distinct advance on 1883-84. The ex-inoculators had only 154 last season, and have 253 this season; the municipal vaccinator, who was warned for dismissal with only 147 cases last year, shows 685 this year. Inspection very good. 54. The inspection has been good; Dr. Mullane himself saw 1,508 cases, and reports 90.24 per cent. successful; the native inspector saw 3,940 cases, with an average of 83.60 per cent. successful. Even these averages, which are much less favourable than last year, are considered by Dr. Mullane (and I agree with him) too good. He states that unsuccessful operations are generally concealed from inspection. Result of a school inspection at hazard. 55. He has again given the result of a chance inspection of a páthshála on the roadside. There were 34 children present, and of these 10 were vaccinated, 8 inoculated, 5 protected by small-pox, and 11 altogether unprotected. These chance enquiries are very useful, and might with advantage be imitated in other districts. The age of the vaccinated children should be added, and especially the condition of the vaccine scar. Expenditure. 56. The cost of vaccination in Kámrúp is in marked contrast to the adjoining district of Goálpára. In the latter it has been shown that the average cost of each operation by paid operators was 1 anna 8 pies only, whereas in Kámrúp it is 3 annas 2¼ pies. This is due to each vaccinator showing a less average of results in Kámrúp than in Goálpára. It is not possible to bring all the districts to the same standard; because in each opposition or concession on the one side, skill and persuasiveness on the other, must vary; but in Kámrúp there is considerable improvement possible; although it is rather ungenerous so to criticise work which has made a decided and genuine advance during the two seasons vaccination has been superintended by Dr. Mullane. The total cost of the season was Rs. 841-11-4, of which the Government share was Rs. 450. The work of ex-inoculators in Kámrúp con- sidered. 57. There are two points connected with vaccination in Kámrúp that require special notice; the first is the continued employment of ex- inoculators. The opinion of Dr. Dobson as to their useful- ness and reliability in Goálpára has been quoted at length (paragraph 45). But it was chiefly in Kámrúp that both these qualifications had been called in question in the report of 1883-84. When it was seen that the Chief Commissioner's distinct orders as to their non-employment generally, conveyed in paragraph 10 of the Resolution on that year's working of the department, had been followed by the continued employment of 18 men.
REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. 13 a special explanation was called for. Dr. Mullane in reply states in substance that both the Deputy-Commissioner and the Civil Surgeon were of opinion it was not advisable to dismiss these men all at once; and that the saving clause of the Chief Commis- sioner's order was made available to keep 18 of the best of them who could have their work fairly inspected. It may here be stated that the unpaid work of these 18 men, amounting to 4,569 vaccinations and 4,243 successes, is nearly half of the whole district work, and that without their aid vaccination in Kámrúp would make a very poor show indeed. Their operative value. 58. As to the genuine character and real value of the unpaid vaccination, Dr. Mullane's opinion is less decided. He is quite satisfied that these men have a local influence and persuasion that overcomes opposition, so that vaccination is introduced by them where all other operators would fail; but on the crucial points of the objections, viz., their practice of inoculation and vaccination indiscriminately, the sustained purity of the lymph used, and the protection which follows their operation, Dr. Mullane is silent. These, however, will, 1 feel sure, not escape his observation, and so long as they are duly instructed, licensed, and inspected by competent superiors, the objection to their employment disappears. Results of compulsory vaccination at Gauháti. 59. The other point in Kámrúp is the result of compulsory vaccination within municipal limits. This remains, as stated in the report of 83.84, practically a dead letter. In consequence of the Chief Commissioner's Resolution (paragraph 17) an effort appears to have been made to carry out the provisions of the Vaccination Act of 1880; 14 prosecutions were instituted before an Honorary Magistrate, and either small fines inflicted or the child ordered to be vaccinated. The results do not seem very commensurate with the trouble, loss of time, and detention from their other duties which this process entails on the sanitary authorities. NOWGONG. Nowgong shows the greatest advance of the year. 60. The energy which has lately been infused into vaccination in this district has received a remarkable development in the operations for 1884-85. Ten years ago the numbers were counted in less than hundreds, where now they are numbered by thousands. Excellent annual report. 61. The annual report is written by Mr. McNaught, the newly-appointed Civil Medical Officer, and is replete with careful observations. In an appendix is reprinted a special memorandum on the vaccination of the year, which is commended to the attentive perusal of all the Civil Surgeons in the Province. Systematic division of labour, 62. Instead of the work being carried out in the desultory manner hitherto, the district was divided into nine areas, and the operators received clear orders to confine their visits to their own area. Each of them received &quot; parwanas,&quot; and the mauzadars also received the same, indicating the vaccinator who was appointed to their thána. They still meet with that prohibition against vaccination by the Gosains, which appears to be founded as much on personal interest as upon religious fanaticism. and close supervision. 63. Inspection has been much more searching. Assistant-Surgeon Hari Charan Sen, who was in medical charge of Nowgong almost the whole season, inspected 1,928 cases, and found 1,620, or 84 per cent., successful. A native inspector was appointed for the first time, and he inspected 4,001 cases, and found 3,126, or 78 per cent., successful. Mr. McNaught, who joined late in the season, saw 154 operations, and reported 84, or 54.54 per cent., suc- cessful. All these figures are much nearer the truth than the returns of last year. Knowing the close personal attention which Mr. McNaught gives to details and the discrimination he gives to each particular case, I am inclined to think that his low per- centage is the most reliable of the three. Results 64. The work done in 1884-85 is very satisfactory. Vaccination was performed in 543 villages, and the total of cases reached 10,872. In 1883-84 the total was Rs. 2,983. There were 9,402 reported as successful, being an average of 86.47; only seven re-vaccinations, of which four were successful. Last year there were only the Civil Surgeon, three provincial, two local, and one Hospital-Assistant vaccinator at work. This year the staff was increased to 14, viz., one Civil Surgeon and one Assistant-Surgeon, one native inspector, three provincial, six local, and two Hospital-Assistants. No compounders and no ex-in- oculators were employed. Complaints of the temporary employment of the working staff, and advises apprentices. 65. The task of training vaccinators is seriously hampered by the system of discharg- ing the employés at the end of the season. Mr. McNaught recommends apprentices, but the difficulty is to find in- E
14 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. fluential men who would come. The term is usually applied to youths; but certainly youths are not the best operators. Men of middle age are more successful in overcoming the prejudices of villagers. At present, the old hands who have acquired the confidence of the people turn to some other occupation in the off season, and training has to be done all over again in October. Inoculation is supposed to be widely prevalent from the scars commonly met with, but no outbreak of small-pox was directly traced to its practice. According to the vital statistics, small-pox was generally absent from Nowgong during the year. Lymph supplies 66. The supply of lymph was obtained from many sources during the year. The original supply of eight tubes from this office was good, and started the work; but it was found extremely difficult to keep up the supply, owing to the children vaccinated being old enough to be worried by the itching, and nearly all the vesicles were burst. This corresponds with my own observation. I have seen very few cases of uninjured vesicle. During the season good lymph was obtained from Bengal and Dacca; that from Almorah failed. Tea-garden vaccination. 67. The vaccination on tea-gardens in Nowgong as reported is insignificant. The coolie population for 1884 is 11,438, and of these 24 gardens, with a population of 5,725, returned 240 cases of vaccination, with 199 successful; on 21 gardens there was none. The usual excuses are advanced, viz., that the coolies object. On some gardens the managers consider the vaccination should be done by Government agency, although by Rule 131, under Act I. of 1882, the responsibility is clearly on the medical officer of the garden. District officers should require more attention to the provisions of the law. These are neglected simply from not being enforced. Every manager, both as an example and from self-interest, should call on the medical officer of the garden to do his duty in this respect. Expenditure. 68. The total cost of the vaccinating establishment of Nowgong for the season and year was Rs. 930, of which Rs. 398 was charged in salaries to Government, Rs. 382 to Local Funds, and Rs. 149 travelling allowances. Each vaccinator, permanent and temporary, is credited with over 1,000 successful operations, and the average cost, weighted as the annual charge has been for the first time with an inspector, is reduced from 3 annas 1 pie in 1883-84 to 1 anna 7 pie in 1884-85. Conclusions. 69. The report is favourable in the three most important points, viz., wide dissemi- nation, efficient inspection, and reduced average cost. There remains now only the doubt as to genuine protection, which is general to the Province, and which it is plain from Mr. McNaught's Memoran- dum will receive particular attention at his hands. Acknowledgments of local efforts, 70. For the successful results of the year every acknowledgment is due to Mr. Driberg's enthusiasm and support. To Assistant-Surgeon Hari Charan Sen great credit is due. Mr. Driberg reports him as most active and energetic, and constantly supervising the vaccinators. In a very able covering report the Deputy-Commissioner makes the following remarks:REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. 15 to a limited extent trained before starting. Inspections were general; in only one instance was the lymph found to be bad. Working staff materially augmented. 73. The subordinates employed under the Civil Surgeon were largely added to. Last year only six were employed; but in the present year there were 12, inclusive of Hospital-Assistants. A native inspector was sanctioned by the Chief Commissioner (No. 7,737, dated Shillong, 22nd November 1884), but he was not appointed. No other explanation can be given (in Dr. Campbell's absence) by Assistant-Surgeon Umesh Chandra Ghosh, except that probably the services of a competent man were not procurable. Results. 74. The work of the season is a total of 8,986 vaccinations, of which 7,933, or 88.28 per cent., are reported as successfal. There were 26 re-vaccinations, of which 4 were successful. The Civil Surgeon himself performed 628 times, with a successful average of 90.44 per cent. Two provincial vaccinators at Tezpur had an average of 906 cases, with 92.09 per cent., and two at Mangaldai had 955 each and 86 85 per cent. successful. Three Local Fund vaccinators at Tezpur had had an average of 724 and 90.16 per cent., and 3 at Mangaldai 681 and 83.01 per cent. Hospital-Assistant Dwarika Nath Shome at Mangal- dai had 390 cases and 91.28 successful. All these are good figures, and show what may be done by zeal and good management. Inspection defective. 75. The inspections, however, have been insufficient, and it must be repeated here, as in last year's report, that without efficient inspection, the figures and the genuine work are both doubtful. When only one case in 9 has been verified, there is wide room for misplaced confidence. Here, as elsewhere, the vaccination in tea- gardens is not general. 76. On the important tea-gardens of this district very little work is being done. Dr. Campbell mentions that all the children of immigrants are vaccinated at Dhubri; but this has ceased since the spring of 1884. The immigrant population on gardens for 1884 is 24,144, of whom 6,250 are classed as children. When therefore the number vaccinated in a year is only 300, there is a certainty that many hundreds are left unprotected. Dr. Campbell should make a point of examining the arms of any children he may see when on a visit to tea-gardens; in this way an accurate idea may be gained of the reality or otherwise of the vaccination going on. Method of communicating. 77. Apparently the vaccination in this district is carried from arm-to-arm and by ivory and goose quill points. No mention is made of crusts, but it is more than doubtful whether they are not here, as elsewhere, largely used. It is to ascertain these details of genuine vaccination that more thorough inspection is urgently needed. Feelings of the people passive. 78. The feeling of the people is generally favourable; though Assistant-Surgeon Umesh Chandra Ghose (who writes the annual report) describes it in the Tezpur thána as &quot;quiet submission.&quot; At greater distances from the sadr station the people are averse to vaccination: &quot;they dread its immediate action, and do not believe in its future efficacy.&quot; Inoculation practised secretly and in re- mote villages. 79. Inoculation is said to be seldom used now, although nearly the whole adult population carry the marks of it. On one occasion an inoculator appears to have begun work, but to have been threatened and stopped. The Doms and Miris have no objections to offer. Small-pox was comparatively trifling all through the year, the maximum being 90 deaths for the district in May. It is stated that no death from small-pox occurred in either Tezpur or Mangaldai towns during the year. Expenditure. 80. The cost of the establishment has been very small, viz., Rs. 360 to Govern- ment and Rs. 348 to Local Funds. No travelling allowances appear in the accounts. If the monthly rates of pay are inclusive of travelling allowance, this should be stated in a foot-note to Statement V. The vaccinators entertained at Mangaldai received only five and a half months' pay. The total cost was Rs. 708, and the average of each successful operation 1 anna 7½ pies. The inordinate cost of each operation in Mangaldai last year, viz., 6½ annas, was reduced to 1 anna 4½ pies in 1884-85. Vaccination should be extended to Bishwa- nath. 81. I observe with regret that no effort has yet been made to open up Bishwanath to vaccination. Deputy-Commissioner's review. 82. The annual report is forwarded with a review by the Deputy-Commissioner, who mentions Dr. Campbell's constant inspection duty. But the district is too wide and the means of travel too defective for the Civil Surgeon to fulfil inspection as it ought to be done. A good man
16 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. should be selected, on whose honesty and energy reliance can be placed; and he should work the more distant areas, and, if possible, get men into Bishnath. A little influence and tact are also required from the local authorities in gaining ground. The presence of a vaccinator attached to the camp of the district officer in the cold season has many advantages. Conclusion. 83. On the whole, vaccination at Mangaldai has made material progress, and both Dr. Campbell and the subordinates merit praise; but it must be impressed on the staff of all ranks that the benevolent objects of Government can never be satisfactorily attained unless the work done is thoroughly protective against small-pox; neither can the prejudices of the common people be really overcome except by their self-interest in the same direction. SIBSÁGAR. Annual report. 84. The Civil Surgeon, Mr. Atkins, has written the annual report, although he had had only a short acquaintance with the district, having taken over charge from Dr. Partridge on the 18th February. It is unnecessarily diffuse, separate reports and tables having been prepared for the sub- divisions at Jorhát and Golághát. The report and statements of the district should comprise the sub-divisions also; only in Statements II. and V. is division into municipal, town, sadr, or sub-division called for. Inspection. 85. There is very little information in the report. Mr. Atkins, being new to the Province, has much to learn. He went in March to the vaccination ground, and inspected 184 casesREPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. 17 vaccinate the Nágas if possible. Small-pox is said to have again been brought into the plains markets by the hill Nágas. Lymph supply said to have been unfavour- able. 92. All the bovine lymph supplied from the Sanitary Commissioner, Bengal, was unsuccessful. No mention is made of the English lymph which was supplied ; in point of fact, of 10 distinct and separate supplies only one is stated to have been good and efficient. This is in such marked contrast with the reports from other districts that I apprehend there was little or no trouble taken with selection of first cases, watching the operation, and carefully establishing the result. Inspector required 93. Sibságar should have an energetic native inspector for 1885-86. All the statistics and the report have a shadow of distrust and doubt in their value. The actual work done is never known; and the operators, without fear of detection, become slack. LAKHIMPUR. Annual report is received late 94. The annual report of the season is prepared by Surgeon R. R. H. Whitwell, Civil Surgeon of Dibrugarh. It has been delayed for several week by references, and has been received, still somewhat defective, only on the 26th June. Operations. 95. The work was conducted on the same lines as last year. Each vaccinator was given a defined area and aided by a parwana, calling on the mauzadars to assist him. He was ordered to report progress, in person if possible, once a month. In North Lakhimpur, Dr. Cran selected the vaccinators and superintended their operations. The assistance given by the mauzadars was very slight. Inspection very thorough. 96. The inspection has been painstaking and thorough. The following remarks are especially deserving of record:18 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. receive Rs. 81, instead of Rs. 72, and the difference might tempt him to remain. Of course, the reduction 25 per cent. would be proportionate to higher or lower rates elsewhere. Proposal to require a previous term of vac- cination from all medical pupils. Statistics. 99. I think less favourably of another suggestion, viz., that all medical students should, on matriculation, give a certificate of qualification in vaccination by six months' district training. District work requires old and well-known hands, men who have acquired influence, not raw lads, whose zeal would be sure to outrun discretion and bring odium on the system. The work of the season in Lakhimpur shows a good advance on last year's statistics. Altogether, there were 6,475 primary vaccinations and 5,637, or 87.05, successful. Very little of this has been on the frontier from difficulty of access and inspection. In North Lakhimpur there were only 1,396 operations and 1,150 successful. Hospital-Assistant Karim Ali must be informed that much more will be expected next year. There is a Provincial and a local vaccinator to assist him; and a much higher average is expected. Opposition met with. 100. Dhol Govind and his son Gopi Nath Dás, the ex-inoculators, were very useful in overcoming prejudices in several villages where vaccina- tion has previously been stubbornly refused. It was described by them as only English inoculation. In one instance, Gopi Nath vaccinated 200 children in a village where not one had been allowed previously. The Nágas continue obstinately to refuse, notwithstanding generous offers of rum, old hats and coats. They allege the general belief that it will cause small-pox, being no doubt unable to distinguish between vaccination and inoculation. It is also likely that they fear illness, restraint, and separation; as they can only be operated upon during their annual subsequent visits to Dibrugarh for trade. Working staff. 101. The staff in Lakhimpur consisted of the Civil Surgeon, one Hospital-Assistant, four provincial, one municipal, and three local vaccinators. Dr. Whitwell is, as last year, conspicuously in advance, with 1,415 primary and 145 secondary vaccinations. Of the former, 86.99 per cent., and of the latter, 72.41 per cent. were successful. Three provincial and two local vaccinators near Dibrugarh had averages over 650 each; and one of each class at North Lakhimpur nearly 550 each. As usual, the municipal vaccinator showed the lowest amount of work, with only 261 cases. Small-pox not prevalent. 102. Last year small-pox was nowhere very prevalent in the district. In the compulsory area in Dibrugarh itself seven deaths were registered, and 69 in the whole district. But at intervals the ravages of the disease among the wild tribes of the frontier are terribly severe. Lymph supply as first received was a failure. 103. Dr. Whitwell found all his first supplies of lymph, alike from Shillong, Darjeeling, and Calcutta, failures; he is unable to explain this. Probably he began too early in the season. He lost three weeks and 800 cases by this delay. Subsequent-regular supplies from the Sanitary Commissioners of Bengal and Darjeeling were very good. He began work with lymph personally collected from the Gurkha sepoys and children in cantonments. He made several efforts to cultivate and collect bovine lymph, unsuccessfully. Expenditure is much above the average 104. The detail of the cost of the operations, given in Table V., shows the average for this district is higher than in any other except the Khási Hills, viz., 4 annas 3¾ pies. This is due partly to the high rate of wages, Rs. 15 monthly, of the vaccinators, partly to considerable travelling allowances, Rs. 308, and partly to the low average of operations. The total expenses amounted to Rs. 1,122, of which Rs. 597 was charged to provincial, Rs. 426 to local, and Rs. 99 to municipal revenue. Inspection. 105. 2,604, or 39.28 per cent., of the total vaccinations were inspected, and 2,124, or 81.57 per cent., found successful. This proportion is much more reliable than that given for Sylhet; but it is also evident that the medical officers hold very different views as to what constitutes a success. I wholly support Dr. Whitwell that the essential value of an inspection is to elicit its protective value against small-pox. Compulsory vaccination. 106. The report adds a paragraph on the working of the Vaccination Act in the compulsory area of Dibrugarh in accordance with Chief Commissioner's Resolution, paragraph 17 of the Report for 1883-84. It is stated only 182 children have been placed on the register since September 1883, when the Act came into force. As the population of Dibrugarh is 7,153, there must have been great laxity here. It would appear also that most of the work has been done among immigrant families. The municipal vaccinator performed 261, with 243 successes, and Dr. Whitwell not quite 200 with 175 successes. The latter were chiefly among the Dooms, who allowed the Civil Surgeon to vaccinate their children, but
REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. 19 refused to yield to native operators. There were fifteen prosecutions under the Act: four were dismissed and eleven fined in small sums. In cantonments there were 65 children on the register; of these 64 have been vaccinated. Nothing is known of any prosecutions. Annual Report. 107. The annual report for Lakhimpur has been prepared with intelligence and care. The work of the season was prosecuted with energy; and my acknowledgments are due to Dr. Whitwell. There ought to be four more local vaccinators provided in the local budget; and a district inspector appointed. NÁGA HILLS. Progress among the Nágas. 108. The spread of vaccination among the Nágas, Mikirs, and others of the hill tribes has made a considerable advance during last season; but the value of the work is not fully proved, owing to the want of inspection. Surgeon Borah commenced the operations and trained the vaccinators; but was then absent from December to February, while the work was mainly in progress. He was on special tours with the Deputy-Commissioner through independent Nága villages. Inspection. 109. Hence out of 1,228 cases reported, only 202 were inspected, and the average of successes found to be 84.65 per cent. Among the 1,228 cases no less than 1,182, or 96.25, are said to have been successful. This is another instance of the unreality of work by subordinates which is not tested as to its purity and genuine character. Expenditure. 110. The cost of the year was Rs. 377-6, of which Rs. 180 was paid by Govern- ment, Rs. 91-6 from local subscriptions for an extra temporary vaccinator for seven months, travelling allowances Rs. 106, and small items for coolies, sweetmeats, &c. The average cost of all the successful operations was 5 annas 1 pie; but if the work of the two specially-paid vaccinators be alone counted, the average cost rises to Re. 1-1-3. There is one permanent vaccinator on Rs. 15 a month, who is said to have worked for six months; but I think he might with advantage be employed all the year round. There must be many villages in the Nága Hills where climate, at all events, would not prevent this. Tribes who were vaccinated. 111. Vaccination appears confined so far to Kohima and Wokha. Of those who accepted it, 80 were Angámi and 382 Llota Nágas, 728 were Mikirs, and 38 other classes. Dr. Borah states the Angámis are averse; the Lhotas indifferent; and the Mikirs are somewhat willing. Inoculation is unknown among these tribes; and the only means of protection when attacked with small-pox is to leave the village and encamp around it till the epidemic has subsided. Conclusion. 112. Dr. Borah's attention is specially invited to the remarks made in paragraph 50 of the Annual Report on Vaccination for 1883-84, The use of old crusts to start the work is full of danger; and any statistics of uninspected operations which give more than 85 per cent. of successes should be viewed with suspicion. Vaccination which is merely a statistical success is not any benefit to the people. Inspection is absolutely essential, and selected fresh lymph from arm to arm must be used as often as possible. KHÁSI AND JAINTIA HILLS. Incidents of the year. 113. The past season has been an eventful one in this district. It began by the Bengal inoculators visiting the Khási villages and extending their work. When this was heard, a notice was sent prohibiting inoculation; but, in reply, the Seim of Nongkreem presented a petition to the Deputy-Commissioner to the effect that he anticipated disturbance of the peace if the prohibition was insisted on. The Deputy-Commissioner ruled that the prohibition must be withdrawn as illegal outside municipal limits. In Darrang, however, where there is no municipality, the annual report states that under similar circumstances the prohibition was effectual. The result of permitting these Bengalis to continue their custom has been a widespread and desolating epidemic of small-pox, which is only now (June 1885) disappearing; and to a certain extent the epidemic has led to a change in the feeling of the people. They have realised the danger of inoculation, and vaccination has been much more freely accepted. Statistics. 114. The total number of primary operations in 1883-84 was 1,861 and this was noted as a very successful year. In 1884-85 the total is 3,545, of which 3,026, or 85.35 per cent., are reported to have been good. There was, however, no inspection by the Civil Surgeon, and the figures are those of the native vaccinators only. There were 114 re-vaccinations, of which 107, or 93.85 per cent., are said to have succeeded.
20 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. Working staff. 115. The staff consisted of the Civil Surgeon for the time being, who operated fifteen times with ten successes; two Provincial vaccinators, one permanent, and one employed for six months, who together return 3,022 operations with 2,600 successes; a vaccinator at Mauphláng dispensary paid by Government, whose work was very small, being 185 cases and 136 successes; and three Hospital-Assistants engaged in and near Shillong, who performed 323 operations and had 280 successful. There are no ex-inoculators in this district. Lymph supply generally good. 116. The lymph was obtained in the beginning by four tubes from England supplied from this office; and on six other occasions during the season from the Sanitary Commissioner of Bengal, being two each of vaccine, humanised vaccine, and bovine lymph. The humanised vaccine lymph was a partial failure; but all the rest was found good and efficient. Expenses very great; 117. The cost remains very large, the average of each successful operation, notwithstanding the increased numbers reported, being 4 annas 10 pies, 7 pies more than in 1883-84. This is partly accounted for by the higher rate of pay, Rs. 16; but the chief expense is in the travelling allowance bills, which amount to Rs. 440-11. This, with Rs. 363-3-2, salaries of Government employés, brings the total cost to Government for the season to Rs. 803-14-2, and proves the urgent need of inspection. The municipal grant was Rs. 150, but of this only Rs. 64 appears to have been expended in the pay of a man during the non-vaccinating season; and the balance is said to be deposited in the savings bank. and ought to be reduced. 118. Notwithstanding the great increase of work which is reported to have been done, the actual results in the absence of efficient inspection by superior authority cannot be accepted as genuine; and it is certainly most desirable that the travelling allowances should be reduced. There is apparently no check on the amount claimed under this head. Annual report is meagre and the results are not reliable. 119. The annual report contains nothing interesting except the second-hand information about small-pox in the Khási villages. So long as the civil medical duties are additional to the military and there is no district inspection, the real progress of vaccination in its protective value must remain open to grave doubts. GÁRO HILLS. Continued progress reported. 120. It will be remembered that progress in this district, which had been retarded by great sickness among the operators in 1882-83, made a very extraordinary advance in the season of 1883-84. The total rose from 2,432 to 7,263; and of successes from 1,973 to 6,938. In the present year the increase, although less marked, is still very satisfactory ; the total has now reached 8,683, with 8,464, or 97.47 per cent., of successful operations. Distribution of the work. 121. Vaccination began in Tura on the 12th September with good lymph in tubes from Dacca and Darjeeling ; and on the 1st October the vaccinators began their tour into the district; two new men, who had been first carefully trained, forming part of the staff of six. They travelled in pairs and worked a given area until every village had been visited. Among the hill Gáros little or no opposition was met with ; but in the plains the refusal to accept vaccination was occasionally invincible. Protection is now fairly general. 122. The report mentions that the Gáros are now fairly protected, with the exception of a small area west of Tura. The adult popula- tion are generally scarred after inoculation, but this is now dying out, and vaccination preferred. During the past ten years, 39,784 successful cases have been reported ; and although, as Captain Maxwell points out, a very large proportion is only what the medical subordinates tell us, yet there is reason to believe that under the careful training of the operators, the rigid selection of good lymph, and the close inspection instituted and maintained by Mr. McNaught, the results have been fairly protective. For example, during the present season, out of 1,370 cases which were personally inspected, Mr. McNaught himself found 1,320, or 96.35 per cent., good, and how particular he is may be inferred from his paper on the subject printed as an appendix to this report. Again, Dr. Gupta, who succeeded Mr. McNaught in medical charge of the district in February 1885, made a tour of inspection in March, and saw 533 cases, and found only 7 unsuccessful. This gives even a higher percentage of 98.68 ; and his testimony is the more valuable, because he particularly mentions that he saw the vaccination principally in its later degree, and that from the excellent type of the scars, he considered the vaccination to be &quot; eminently satisfactory.&quot; I would, however, mention that when I visited Tura itself in November 1884, I examined half a dozen children at hazard in the police lines, and found not one of them with a good scar, although all were said to have been vaccinated.
REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. 21 No small-pox in Tura. 123. The report states that no deaths from small-pox were reported in the district in 1884 ; but this refers probably to Tura station itself, which is the only place where vital statistics are collected. District staff. 124. There were six provincial vaccinators, and they averaged 1,436 operations each, This is the best on record up to date. There were only 5 cases of re-vaccination. The Hospital-Assistant at the dispensary and the Civil Surgeon had very few cases. It is their particular duty to see that all the children in Tura itself are adequately protected. Expenditure. 125. The cost of the establishment is paid entirely by Government, and amounted to Rs. 460-5-2 in salaries and Rs. 373-8-3 in travelling allowances. The average cost of each successful operation was 1 anna 7 pies. This is a great contrast to the Khási Hills district operations. Review by the Deputy-Commissioner. 126. The annual report is forwarded by Captain. Maxwell with a concise and valuable review of the work. He states that all the credit of the past season's success is due to Mr. McNaught, and with this I fully agree. In this district the success is not one of figures only; but, as appears from superior inspection, to be genuine and of real protective value, and I cordially recommend Mr. McNaught's exertions to favourable notice. SYLHET. The results of 1884-85 less satisfactory than those of 1883-84. 127. The annual report on vaccination in this large and important district is a great contrast to the flourishing propects and success of the season 1883-84. It may be remembered that the Sanitary Commissioner wrote of the latter as &quot; everything that could be desired,&quot; and made copious extracts from it; and the Chief Commissioner's Resolution (paragraph 19) considered &quot;the development of vaccination in Sylhet reflects high credit upon Dr. Macnamara and the district officers.&quot; Annual report is uninteresting. 128. For the current season Dr. Macnamara's report is short and perfunctory, and, instead of the careful and lengthy covering review which was acknowledged with such pleasure last year, the Deputy- Commissioner has forwarded this annual report practically without comment. The inference presents itself that the Civil Surgeon is discouraged by the retrogression which has taken place, and more especially by the necessity forced on him of beginning the work every year with new hands. His opening sentence explains this :22 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. Statistics. 131. The gross outcome of the year by 36 operators is 18,818 cases and 18,341 successful, or 97.46 per cent. There were 78 re-vaccinations, and 61, or 78.2 per cent., successful. In 1883-84 the working staff comprised 35 persons, the returns showed 22,993 cases, and 22,068 and 95.98 per cent. successful. Distribution. 132. The detail of the vaccination in Statement II. shows that the work chiefly fell on ten provincial vaccinators in the sadr division. These men performed, on an average, 1,084 cases each, with a reported success of 99.61 per cent. The next highest average is one local fund vaccinator in Habiganj 823 and 98.84 per cent., and three local vaccinators in Maulavi Bázár who reached an average of 793 and 96.8 per cent. In Sunámganj, Balaganj, and Karimganj the local and municipal vaccinators did 500 or less. The Civil Surgeon, native inspector, assistant inspector, the several Hospital-Assistants and municipal vaccinators, did nothing specially deserving record. Inspection. 133. Inspection of 10,299 cases is reported, and the proportion of successful is given as 99.52. Of these the Civil Surgeon saw 830 and the native inspectors 9,469. On this subject Dr. Macnamara writesREPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. 23 Surgeon-Major Monteath was in bad health and altogether unfit for duty at the beginning of the season, and afterwards Surgeon H. C. Banerji, in military employ, held the civil duties in addition, and was not available for any district visiting. Lymph supply. 138. Many serious complaints have been made for the last two years as to the quality of the lymph obtained, and the Deputy-Commissioner in forwarding the report states that these complaints had frequently been made to him. It may be as well to explain here how the supply of lymph for the Province is arranged. Early in each year an indent is prepared in this office for English lymph in tubes and passed on to the Sanitary Commissioner with the Government of India for supply. The indent for 1884-85 asked for 200 tubes, and in reply the Sanitary Commissioner intimated it had been reduced to 100 in consequence of the difficulty in obtaining a large supply of good lymph. The lymph was received on the 23rd September, and immediately distributed. Dr. Partridge states that three tubes were sent to Cachar, but this is probably a mistake: eight English tubes, and one of calf lymph from Bombay were forwarded to Cachar on the 6th October. Beside this initial supply, every Civil Surgeon is in communication direct with the Sanitary Commissioners of Bengal and the North-West Provinces, and obtains periodical or emergent supplies. Manifestly, it is the proper way that Civil Surgeons should make their own arrangements for Indian lymph. It would be a useless circumlocution that all supply should first be centralised at Shillong, then again radiated. I have heard of no difficulties elsewhere; the quality varies, but supply by crust or tubes is always ample. Probably, Dr. Monteath's ill-health was the cause of this, as of many other shortcomings where the civil medical duties had been allowed to fall altogether to subordinates. Dr. Partridge says that the quality of the lymph from this office and from the North-West Provinces was good, that from Calcutta bad. It is of course understood that the first limited supply of selected English lymph shall be used in the sadr station only on selected cases and under the personal supervision of the Civil Surgeon. When once the local supply has been established, the vaccinators themselves should be held responsible for keeping it up, but in practice no doubt many of them are exceedingly careless, and without constant inspection they fail to keep up tubes or they carry on work with bad lymph. Working staff. 139. The staff of operators employed in Cachar was increased to ten, which included three provincial, one municipal, and three Local Fund vacci- nators. The Civil Surgeon, one Hospital-Assistant, and one compounder added their quota. If three or four more vaccinators are entertained by the Local Board, an application for a native inspector, which is much needed, would probably be sanctioned. From the annual report it is evident that each operator has not been given a definite area in which alone to work; there has been no inspection, and it is probable the favourable statistics of past years are to a large extent untrue. Dr. Partridge has much before him to put vaccination under thorough organised command. Statistics. 140. Notwithstanding an increase of three local operators, the total reaches only 4,744 cases, of which 3,738, or 78.79 per cent., are reported to be successful. There were 13 re-vaccinations, and 9 successful. In 1883-84 there were 5,073 cases, of which 3,926, or 77 per cent., were successful. Examination of particular classes as to protection. 141. The following table gives in this year's report details of particular classes examined with a view to ascer- tain the amount of protection afforded :24 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. surprising they should have been inoculated. It is very desirable that Dr. Mullane's examination of schools haphazard should be followed in every district, so that we may learn to what extent the protection from inoculation and vaccination is advancing and receding. Small-pox very severe in 1884. 143. Last year small-pox was widely and severely prevalent throughout Cachar, affecting the garden labourers:REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. 25 APPENDIX A. INSTRUCTIONS FOR VACCINATORS. (Prescribed by the Order of the Privy Council, 29th July 1871.) 1. Except so far as any immediate danger of small-pox may require, vaccinate only subjects who are in good health. As regards infants, ascertain that there is not any febrile state, nor any irritation of the bowels, nor any unhealthy state of skin; specially no chafing or eczema behind the ears, or in the groin, or elsewhere in folds of skin. Do not, except of necessity, vaccinate in cases where there has been recent exposure to the infection of measles or scarlatina, nor where erysipelas is prevailing in or about the place of residence. 2. In all ordinary cases of primary vaccination, if you vaccinate by separate punctures, make such punctures as will produce at least four separate good-sized vesicles, not less than half an inch from one another; or, if you vaccinate otherwise than by separate punctures, take care to produce local effects equal to those just mentioned. 3. Direct care to be taken for keeping the vesicles uninjured during their progress, and for avoiding afterwards the premature removal of the crusts. 4. Enter all cases in your Register on the day when you vaccinate them, and with all particulars required in the Register up to column 9, inclusive. Enter the results on the day of inspection. Never enter any results which have not been inspected by yourself or your legally-qualified deputy. In cases of primary vaccination, register as &quot; successful&quot; only those cases in which the normal vaccine vesicle has been produced; in cases of re-vaccination, register as &quot; successful&quot; only those cases in which either vesicles, normal or modified, or papules surrounded by areolæ have resulted. When the vaccination of an unsuccessful case is repeated, it should be entered as a fresh case in the register. 5. Endeavour to maintain in your district such a succession of cases as will enable you uniformly to vaccinate with liquid lymph directly from arm to arm; and do not, under ordinary circumstances, adopt any other method of vaccinating. To provide against emergencies, always have in reserve some stored lymph; either dry, as on thickly-charged ivory points constantly well protected from damp, or liquid in fine, short, uniformly capillary (not bulbed) tubes, hermetically sealed at both extremities. Lymph, successfully preserved by either of these methods, may be used without definite restriction as to time; but with all stored lymph caution is necessary, lest in time it have become inert, or otherwise unfit for use. If, in order to vaccinate with recent liquid lymph, you convey it from case to case otherwise than in hermetically-sealed capillary tubes, do not ever let more than eight hours intervene before it is used. 6. Consider yourself strictly responsible for the quality of whatever lymph you use or furnish for vaccination. Never either use or furnish lymph which has in it any, even the slightest, admixture of blood. In storing lymph, be careful to keep separate the charges obtained from different subjects, and to affix to each set of charges the name, or the number in your register, of the subject from whom the lymph was derived. Keep such note of all supplies of lymph which you use or furnish as will always enable you, in any case of complaint, to identify the origin of the lymph. 7. Never take lymph from cases of re-vaccination. Take lymph only from subjects who are in good health, and, as far as you can ascertain, of healthy parentage; preferring children whose families are known to you, and who have elder brothers or sisters of undoubted healthiness. Always carefully examine the subject as to any existing skin disease, and specially as to any signs of hereditary syphilis. Take lymph only from well-characterised uninjured vesicles. Take it (as may be done in all regular cases on the day week after vaccination) at the stage when the vesicles are fully-formed and plump, but, when there is no perceptible commencement of areolæ. Open the vesicles with scrupulous care to avoid drawing blood. Lake no lymph which, as it issues from the vesicle, is not perfectly clear and trans- parent, or is at all thin and watery. From such a vesicle as vaccination by puncture commonly produces, do not, under ordinary circumstances, take more lymph than will suffice for the immediate vaccination of five subjects, or for the charging of seven ivory points, or for the filling of three capillary tubes; and from larger or smaller vesicles take only in like proportion to their size. Never squeeze or drain any vesicle. Be careful never to transfer blood from the subject you vaccinate to the subject from whom you take lymph. 8. Scrupulously observe in your inspections every sign which tests the efficiency and purity of your lymph. Note any case wherein the vaccine vesicle is unduly hastened or otherwise irregular in its development, or wherein any undue local irritation arises; and, if similar results ensue in other cases, vaccinated with the same lymph, desist at once from employing it. Consider that your lymph ought to be changed, if your cases, at the usual time of inspection on the day week after vaccination, have not, as a rule, their vesicles entirely free from areolæ. 9. Keep in good condition the lancets or other instruments which you use for vaccinating, and do not use them for other surgical operations. When you vaccinate, have water and a napkin at your side, with which invariably to cleanse your instrument after one operation before proceeding to another. APPENDIX B. Memorandum on the vaccination seen during the Civil Medical Officer's tour, Nowgong District. 11th and 12th March 1885.26 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. has been but rarely carried out. The vaccinator states that the people often object to even two marks being done, as the inoculators generally do one mark, and he has to comply with their prejudice in order to have vaccination done. Many of the scars on the 41 persons were through scratching or other causes, without the distinctive character that would without doubt indicate a true vaccine mark. The vac- cine virus used is crusts. He does not appear to know how to properly select and perform vaccination by lymph only, either arm to arm or from supply stored in tubes. I was able to see the recent vacci- nation in various stages of five to seven days. These were mostly spurious, having dried-up crusts then. The virus in use must be bad, and the so-called vaccination now being done by him must cease, as it is not to be depended upon. His return to Nowgong is directed, and he should at once total up his work of the season. There is no good virus now available. A telegram is now being sent in for despatch to Dacca for a fresh supply of trustworthy lymph. Vaccinator states that he finds considerable difficul- ty in places to persuade the people to be vaccinated. He states that the potter caste (Kuwar) will not be vaccinated unless the Gossain, name unknown, who lives in Dibrugarh district, Halmora, mauza Chamagurihuttra, will permit them; also the Hut Kulia, a caste whose Gossain is Peali of Khola Katiahuttra, Nowgong district. Perhaps something may be done to move the Gossains to permit their followers to be vaccinated in approaching cold weather. The work done is scattered over large areas, a few here and there, and with difficulty found and examined. The vaccinator does not keep up a proper diary, and has no printed register of vaccination. 13th to 15th March 1885.REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. 27 be better off than others; but often the class of vaccinators found comprises those who are ex-inocula- tors, those who are wanting in intelligence to understand the plain instructions placed in their hands, those who, though willing and active, lack a proper training; sometimes men who can neither read nor write; men deficient in energy and truthfulness, making up for their laziness or ill success by plenty of book-entered successes, with a tolerable sprinkling of good men who can be trusted, and these all are the principal channels through which vaccination is brought to the people. If bad vaccination is done no amount of supervision afterwards will remedy it. 4. To open out good prospects and encourage respectable men to engage in vaccination, there might be apprentices on Rs. 5 per month; these, after passing, being appointed vaccinators on Rs. 10, and, after showing themselves trustworthy, to be eligible as28 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. 13. There seems some doubt about the rule in the register if a vaccine operation fails; whether to write the person's name again further down on the date upon which other attempts are made to vaccinate, or to note opposite the original entry the successful repetition of the operation, even if occurring after two or three attempts. The practice varies both in the different districts and amongst vaccinators in the same district. The whole of the Vaccination Statements I. to VI. in annual return show individuals, not operations or attempts at vaccination. If the same individual, after having undergone two or more attempts at vaccination, is entered by name on each of the different dates attempted, it causes an error in the total of individuals vaccinated, as there is no practical means of eliminating these double entries so as to show persons only, vide heading of Statement I., Vaccination Return. The concluding part of paragraph 4 of Rules for performing vaccination is the cause of doubt; of course, it is evident that the successful result could only be entered once. 14. A rule obtains in some districts for the vaccinators to each send in a copy of the register of names of persons vaccinated monthly. A numerical abstract would be preferable, entail less labour, and be useful for the preparation of the annual vaccination return. A copy of the vaccination diary should also be sent in. The vaccinators do not keep up a regular diary, but they should, as this is very essential as a check upon their movements and work. It should contain date, place to which travelled, vlilage headman's name, distance travelled, number of persons vaccinated that day, remarks. As a further check upon the work done and in lieu of the monthly register copies sent in to head-quarters of some districts, a rule is sometimes observed that on the day of vaccination a copy of the part of the register referring to the village is given by the vaccinator to the village headman to take care of and produce when required for inspection, of the children vaccinated, and which can thus be done without the vaccinator being necessarily present with his register book. Printed forms for this should accompany the vaccinator. 15. The vaccinators generally at end of two months return to head-quarters to receive pay, report progress, receive orders, &c., and on these occasions their registers, diary, lymph tubes, lancets, &c., should be examined, and deficiencies supplied. Enquiry should also be made about inoculators, small-pox, or epidemic disease in the locality assigned them. 16. The training of vaccinators to distinguish small-pox, chicken-pox, and measles and healthy from unhealthy children is very useful. If any of the suggestions herein made are worth considering, I shall feel satisfied that I have not laboured in vain. J. McNAUGHT, Civil Medical Officer.

READ ( 2 ) have a percentage of only 64.9 (51.3 in 1883-84). A similar difference exists in the work of Government operators on tea-gardens and in the districts ; there were 3,490 operations by Government agency in tea-gardens, and 73.6 per cent. are reported successful (51.2 per cent. in 1883-84 and 77.8 in 1882-83), against 91,792 operations in the district, with a success-percentage of 91.9. Inspections. 5. Considerable improvement appears in the inspection work of the past year ascompared with its predecessor, 42,534 cases, or 41 per cent. of the total operations of the year, having been inspected, against 25,090, or 32 per cent., in 1883-84. The number of inspections by Civil Surgeons, including the Assistant-Surgeon at Nowgong, has increased from 12,310 to 20,309, and of these the Civil Surgeon of Goálpára contributed 5,930, or 40 per cent. of the total number. The number of vaccinations inspected by Native Superintendents was 22,225. The difference between the success-percentages in Civil Surgeons' and Superintend- ents' inspections is much less marked this year than formerly. In 1883-84 Superintendents found 95 per cent. of inspected cases successful, but Civil Surgeons 85 per cent. only. This year, the percentages are 91.4 and 90.3 respectively showing that Superintendents have tested cases more rigorously, and that the work seen by Civil Surgeons has been of better quality. There is reason, however, to believe that vaccinators endeavour, as far as possible, to show inspecting officers such cases only as they know to have been successful. In Sylhet, the success-percentage on 9,469 cases inspected by Superintendents remains at the incredibly high figure of 99 6 The low percentage (88.7 per cent.) of success recorded by municipal vaccinators, whose work is peculiarly liable to inspection, tends to show that the average success-percentage of the province is still fictitiously high. Secondary operations. 6. Secondary operations numbered 583, of which 463, or 79.4 per cent., weresuccessful. They were chiefly performed by Government vaccinators (195), Civil Surgeons (164), and municipal vaccinators (101), and it does not appear that re-vaccination was practised at all on tea- gardens during the year. Vaccinating staff. 7. The following table gives an abstract statement of the work done by thevaccinating agency under Government employed in the province during the last three years :( 3 ) it exceeds 1,000. The low averages shown in the returns submitted by provincial vacci- nators from Golághát and North Lakhimpur were specially referred to in the report for 1883-84, and these sub-divisions again furnish the lowest averages in the Province.

The number of vaccinators maintained by municipalities, towns, and stations isshown in the margin, the only increase appearing in the districts of Sylhet and Lakhimpur. The number of operations performed by this class of vaccinators has increased from 1,487 in 1883-84 to 4,146, and of these latter, 3,679, or 88.7 per cent., were successful, while the staff has increased by the addition of two vaccinators, and the average per man has risen from 248 to 518. The highest average of work done appears in Dhubri(881 successful cases), and the lowest in Silchar (203), but the returns in all cases showan improvement over the figures of the past year. Local Board staff 10. Forty vaccinators were employed by local boards, as compared with 20 in1883-84, and the number of operations was 26,486, against 15,219. The' largest number of operations is reported from Nowgong, (5,226 successful cases), and the average per head is highest in Goálpára (985). The lowest averages are in Golághát (166), Karimganj (379), Sunámganj (391), and Dhubri (490). The success which has attended the local boards in their efforts to pro- mote vaccination is a most pleasing and hopeful feature in the annals of the year. Ex-inoculators Ex-inoculators. Number.

The vaccinations performed by ex-inoculators were first brought on record in1880, when 58 men were employed, and their operations numbered 8.665. It was observed last year that the 35 men of this class in Kámrúp were practically left without any supervision at all. For 1884-85 their numbers have been reduced to 18, and there are also 8 in Goálpára and 2 in Sylhet; one of the latter is an apprentice, and is shown under that designation in the table in paragraph 7 above. These 28 men did more work than the 51 who were employed in 1883-84. The results recorded in Goálpára, if trustworthy, are extremely credit- able. Dr. Eteson proposes to call this class of men licensed vaccinators as in Bengal, and the change of name is approved. Tea-garden operations. 12. The following table shows the vaccination work among the garden populationperformed by Government and tea-garden agency during the past three years:( 4 ) Lymph. 14. The quality of the lymph furnished to operators in the Province has been aconstant object of complaint during previous years, and different opinions have been given regarding the supply received in 1884-85. The quantity of English lymph in tubes received from the Sanitary Commissioner was only half the amount which had been indented for, and Civil Surgeons received further supplies from Bengal, the North-West Provinces, and Bombay. The lymph was in most cases good; the supply received from Bengal failed in Lakhimpur, but in other districts it proved successful. The different systems at work in the neighbouring districts of Gáro Hills and Goálpára are noted in the report, vaccination being carried on in the former district by lymph in tubes and arm-to-arm vaccination, while in Goálpára the inhabitants object to arm-to-arm vaccination, and crusts are chiefly used in the operations. Compulsory vaccination. 15. The Compulsory Vaccination Act V. (B C.) of 1880 was in force in the areasmentioned below, and the accompanying table gives the available information regarding the work done in them during 1884-85, as compared with the two previous years:( 5 ) provincial vaccinators is only 514. and for local board vaccinators only 433. As regards inspection work, the report shows that 403 cases were inspected by the Civil Surgeons, and 3,593 by hospital-assistants ; the results of these inspections are not separately shown, but in the total 89.36 per cent. are entered as successful. On the whole, there is much room for improvement still. The work done in Lakhimpur was 6,629, against 5,398 operations. Dr. Whitwell inspected 2,604 cases, finding 81.6 per cent. successful. This district has more than trebled its number of vaccinations since 1881-82, and Mr. Ward trusts that it will continue to make progress under Dr. Whitwell's charge. Considerable advance has been made in vaccination work in the Nága Hills, 1,228 operations having been performed, as compared with 473 in 1883-84. The low percentage of inspections (16 per cent.) deducts from the value attached to the reported results: 1,182, or 96.25 per cent. of the operations, are said to have been successful, but among the inspections 84.65 only were found successful. The persons vaccinated were chiefly Mikirs, but there were 382 Lhota Nágas and 80 Angámis. The number of operations in the Khási Hills rose from 1,861 to 3,545. Considerable impetus has been given to the cause of vaccination among the Khásis by a serious outbreak of small-pox during the year, the disease having been propagated by the practice of inoculation. This visitation has opened the eyes of the people to the risks attending inoculation, and disposed them to accept the preventive offered them by the Government. The success attained in the Gáro Hills in 1883-84 continued during 1884-85, and the number of operations has risen from 7,263 to 8,683, of which 8,464, or 97.47 per cent., are reported as successful. Inspection work was efficiently performed by Dr. McNaught and his successor Dr. Gupta, the former examining 1,370 cases, of which 96.35 per cent. were considered successful, and the latter 533 cases, finding only 7 unsuccessful. The Officiating Chief Commissioner observes with satisfaction the favourable mention of Dr. McNaught in the Report, and agrees in ascribing in a large measure to his exertions the signal success of vaccination among the Gáros. The progress recorded in Sylhet has fallen back after the great advance made in 1883-84. The number of operations has decreased from 22,993 to 18,818. This backsliding is attributed by Dr. Macnamara to the disadvantages of working with a temporary staff, especially where the number of men employed is so large as in Sylhet, This is a question which has beentouched on by Dr. Eteson in paragraphs 36 and 37 of his Report, and the Officiating Chief Commissioner will be glad to consider any proposals he may have to make for giving greater permanency to the etsablishment, always remem- bering that the present is not a favourable time for increased expenditure of any kind In Cachar also the number of operations fell from 5,073 to 4,757, though three new local board vaccinators were added. Here the cause was the change of Civil Surgeons during the year. Dr.Monteath was incapacitated by illness, and Dr. Banarjea, who held charge during the greater part of the year, was confined to the station by his regimental duties. The present Civil Surgeon, Dr. Partridge, must endeavour to show an improve- ment during the coming season. Conclusion. 17. In concluding this review of vaccination work in Assam during 1884-85, theOfficiating Chief Commissioner desires to express his satis- faction at the steady progress of the work, and the interesttaken in it by Civil Surgeons, and also to thank Dr. Eteson for his full and interesting Report.

Plan of the Annual Report. 1. The report is prepared in accordance with the plan adopted in previous years:first, a series of tables is introduced, showing the establish- ment, operations, expenditure, and general results in detail; second, a review of the work in each district; third, the general provincial statistics of the season. To these are added appendices of useful information and current topics of interest. Sources from which supply of lymph is obtained. From England very good. 2. The supply of lymph was obtained in the first instance by the Sanitary Com- missioner of Assam from England on indent through the Sanitary Commissioner with the Government of India. 125tubes were received and distributed to the head-quarters of each district on the 30th Sep- tember. It appears to have been of exceptionally good quality, and was favourably mentioned by all the Civil Surgeons,except at Shillong, where only one tube out often gave a successful result. From India of variable quality 3. During the season the Civil Surgeons also received periodical supplies on theirown application direct from the vaccine depôts in Dacca, Darjiling, Calcutta, and a few from Almorah. As usual, the accounts differ widely regarding the value of these country resources. Many were very good, but there were also many failures. In particular, the bovine lymph is rarely vital on reaching Assam. It does not appear to be as yet capable of reproduction after a week, and I fear this will disqualify its introduction into Manipur, towards the fulfilment of which Colonel J. Johnstone, the Political Agent, took so much trouble in 1885. On the whole, superior to former years. 4. But, on the whole, there seems to have been more pains taken to secure whole- some pure vaccination at first; and there have been, in Mr. Kennedy's words, &quot; fewer complaints &quot; of the quality than formerly. The complete directions on this subject which were drawn up by Mr. McNaught and published in Appendix B to the Report of last season, will, if attended to, go far to remove the serious objections which have been taken in past years to bad lymph.

Improved quality of vaccination resulting. 7. This higher standard cannot be attained without constant care and thoroughinspection. The men selected for this superior grade should be reliable, hard-working, and capable; those who are merely plausible and superficial must be dismissed. It too often happens that old vaccinators are promoted on the grounds of past efficient service, but the real test should be their present, not their past, fitness. Additional inspection in South Sylhet yet necessary. Where licensed vaccinators are being employed anew. 8. In Sylhet there is ample space and work for a third native inspector, who musthave his head-quarters at Habiganj. The Local Board have this season re-opened on trial the system of licensed vacci- nators; men who are paid by fees on successful results, and who are under no efficient inspection. This system is to go backwards; and the result will be figures only, and not protection. It has been pointed out in past annual reports that vaccination so performedis pernicious, and brings good work elsewhere in disrepute. If a native inspector is sanctioned for South Sylhet and located at Habiganj, there will be no objection to a limited number of licensed vaccinators working within his beat, under his orders, and on the terms of private remuneration which obtain in Goálpára and Kámrúp; but, except under such conditions, the re-employment of these men should be prohibited. A native Inspector is also wanted in Lakhimpur. 9. Lakhimpur is now the only plains district without an Inspector, although itis so extensive and straggling that one is particularly required. An effort should be made next season to increase the working staff by three more Local Fund vaccinators, and no time should be lost in forwarding an application to have a native inspector sanctioned. Inspection in the bills districts is nominal only. 10. In the Nága and Khási Hills, vaccination is still in a very immature anddisorganised state; but in the Gáro Hills, where the annual record shows several thousand successful cases every year, the necessity of more thorough inspection should be carefully considered.

Certainly, the statistics of Nowgong itself, and to a certain extent those of the district also, point to a material degree of protection having been attained; but we should be on our guard against premature conclusions drawn from the figures of a year which was healthy in other epidemic respects as well as from small-pox. The difficulty is to explain how there should have been such a divergence in results in the two contiguous districts of Sibságar and Nowgong. In both, the Superintendents are especially interested in vaccination; both are zealous and careful workers; both receive earnest support and funds from the district officers; both had nearly the same results last season; yet in 1885-86 Mr. Atkins extends his previous record by 161.39 per cent., while Mr. McNaught loses by 37.32 per cent.

An abstract of Table III. is given in Provincial Statement III., printed at page 25.It is useful, because it gives the percentage of successful operations among the different classes. In primary opera- tions the provincial and licensed vaccinators are the highest ; and these men apparently excel Civil Surgeons in their art. It will be observed that 30 Hospital-Assistants, who have had the benefit of hospital training, are far below the rank and file of vaccinators, of whose training and want of skill no one complains more frequently than Dr. Macnamara, at the very time he claims that their pretentious successes in Sylhet are reasonable.

The municipal vaccinator in Sylhet claims only 88.97 per cent. The work done by garden agency in Sylhet registers only 58.46 per cent., and in 1884-85 was only 28.75 per cent. In no other district of the province is the proportion of successful primary operations within 5 per cent. of the Sylhet record, and. the average of the whole province, weighted as it is with the Sylhet disproportionate record, is only 89.28 per cent. These facts should have more weight than a theoretical opinion based on other climates and operators. TABLE No. V.

Vaccination on tea-gardens by private and official agency is detailed above.The decrease which was noted in the report of last season continues. In 1883-84 there were 15,150 operations; in 1884-85, 11,939; and in 1885-86, 11,542. Of the latter, 9,239, or 80.04 per cent., were reported to be successful. The 11,542 operations were made up of 6,249 primary vaccina- tions by garden agency, and of 5,293 by Government employés. Cachar, as hitherto, shows most work done, and has a small advance on the total of last year. Statistics are imperfect and unreliable. 21. Nearly all the district officers draw attention to the fact that the vaccination returns of tea-gardens are not prescribed by law, and are difficult to obtain. Although Kámrúp has but a small proportion of them, the returns have only been obtained after much difficulty on this date (June 25th) and are still incomplete. The same may be said of every district. Sibságar has a resident garden population almost equal to Cachar, and the contrast in the statis- tics between these two districts marks their extreme unreliability. So long as vaccination is irregularly reported and is dependent on the good-will, or otherwise, of managers, the value of the table is really nothing at all.

In Table No. VI. is detailed, in rather a complex and minute form, the cost of vaccination in Assam. Taken as a whole. 23. The number and classes of the subordinate operators at each station, and for thedistrict, the period during which they have been sanctioned and actually employed, their rates of pay and the amount disbursed, are all noted at length in the first columns. As any of these points which are peculiar will be brought out in the review of each district report, it will be more convenient to mention here merely the total expenditure under the heads of Government, Municipal, and Local Fund vaccinators, with the average cost of each successful operation during the past season. Details. Salaries Travelling allowances increase. 24. The Government charges were Rs. 4,802-11-0 for pay, and Rs. 2,546-13-9travelling allowance; total Rs. 7,349-8-9. In 1884-85 the figures were Rs. 4,317, Rs. 1,603, and Rs. 5,920, respectively. The increase of pay, Rs. 485, is due to additional native inspectors at Darrang (sanc- tioned by Chief Commissioner's No. 7,737, dated 22nd November 1884), at Cachar (sanctioned by No. 5,492, dated 18th September 1885), and at Sibságar (sanctioned by No. 1,495, dated 3rd March1886). The extraordinary increase, to travelling allowance will be duly noticed in those districts, particularly the Khási Hills, where the excess has been very marked. On the whole season, the increase amounts to Rs. 943 over the actuals of 1884-85, without any adequate cause being shown. It seems desirable that the budget allotment under this head should be more closely scrutinised; and that, if exceeded, sanction should only be given on full and satisfactory explanation. Increase of pay for native inspectors is fully met by increased quality and protection; but the increase of travelling allowance is a charge on vaccination which swells the average cost without definite benefits. Share of cost borne by the municipali- ties 25. The share of expenditure borne by municipalities has decreased this year bya sum of Rs. 50. Rs. 150 was paid to the Hospital- Assistant of the Sylhet Dispensary for inspection. On reference to the Annual Report for 1884-85, paragraph 135, it will be observed that I take strong exception to this grant. It is not properly earned; and, the Hospital-Assistant being himself a member of the municipality, is objectionable on general grounds. By Local Fund grants. 26. The most satisfactory feature of the accounts is the material advance in budgetallotments and actual expenditure on vaccination under the head of Local Funds; due to the impulse given in Chief Com- missioner's Resolution on the Local Board's Budget of 1884-85, paragraph 3, which is now coming into effect. This class of operators was increased from 40 to 70, and the payments under this head from Rs. 2,682 to Rs. 4,847-8-10. Summary 27. Summing up the totals, the expenditure on vaccination during 1885-86amounted to Rs. 12,978-2-3, compared with Rs. 9,433 in 1884-85; the total number of successful operations whichwere performed by paid agency was 83,277, compared with 66,793 last season, and theaverage cost in each year 2 annas 5¾ pies and 2 annas 7 pies. 28. If the total of vaccinations be made to include work by licensed vaccinators, by garden doctors and others, the total successful is 108,992, and the average cost 1 anna 10¾ .pies. 29. These are highly satisfactory results, regard being had to the superior protective value of the vaccination, which has been established under adequate inspection since 1884-85.

The results of compulsory vaccination under Act V. of 1880 in the municipa- lities of Sylhet, Gauháti, and Dibrugarh, and in cantonments at the latter station, is illustrated above. 31. The population under the law is 33,255 (Census 1881); and of these 1,801 children were vaccinated during 1885-86, of which 1,551, or 86.11 per cent., were success- ful. In both Gauháti and Dibrugarh the numbers are fairly good, and the protection against small-pox seems, by the results of the last two years, to be improving. In Sylhet, the proportion of operations is comparatively small, and the expense, 12 annas for each success, is relatively very great. There were, however, 168 persons reported in this area, of whom 27 were prosecuted and 15 convicted; so that possibly next season may see better results. Apparently, no registers are kept at Gauháti and Sylhet; without them, the provisions of the Act cannot be properly observed. GOÁLPÁRA. Working staff. 32. This important district, second only to Sylhet in the work done, has remained throughout the season under the careful superintendence of Surgeon E. Dobson. 33. The staff comprised, in addition to one Civil Surgeon and two Hospital-Assist-tants, one native inspector, one Provincial, one Municipal, five Local Board, and nine licensed vaccinators, being thesame total (20) as last season. Results 34. The results continue to be highly satisfactory; 15,285 primary vaccinationswere performed, of which 14,310, or 93.62 per cent., were successful. There were also 67 secondary, with 64, or 95.52, successful. The licensed vaccinators, who are paid by results, furnish the highest average, viz., 1,273 each. The Provincial vaccinator was also successful; but many of those paid by Local Funds worked inadequately. The Civil Surgeon, the Inspector, and two Hospital-Assistants aided in some degree. Inspections. 35. The inspection was thorough; Dr. Dobson himself verified 3,703 cases, andreported 91.70 successful, while the native inspector proved 6,168, with 91.68 per cent. successful. No tea-gardens nor compulsory area. 36. There are no tea-gardens in Goálpára, and no vaccination performed outsideGovernment agency; neither is there any compulsory area nor any prosecutions. Small-pox not prevalent. 37. During 1885 only 436 deaths from small-pox were reported throughout this large and populous district. Of these deaths, 188 occurred in Salmara and 181 at Fakiragram on the south bank. Both stations have hitherto been remarkable as refusing vaccination, but during the past season some progress has been made, and it will be interesting to note the result. Attitude of the people. 38. Dr. Dobson describes the attitude and feeling of the natives as regardsvaccination to be generally that of passive resistance; but in some places, such as the foot of the Gáro Hills and also in the Eastern Duars, the people anxiously await the arrival of the vaccinator, pay c
10 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. him the prescribed fee willingly, treat him with great respect, and feed him on the fat of the land. But these favours are only shown to those operators who are known to be successful, men of local origin and sympathies, who not only vaccinate but smooth away prejudices of the mothers and calm their agitation by propitiatory invocations. The licensed vaccinators in Goálpára have, in short, replaced the old inoculators, and their success is- due quite as much to their personal influence and familiarity with the villagers as it is to the superior virtue of vaccine over variola. Inoculation dying out. 39. Inoculation appears to be gradually but surely dying out under systematicand extended vaccination. No cases were reported, nor were any outbreaks of small-pox originated by it. Thevaccinators take first possession of each district area and guard it jealously fromintrusion, since their livelihood depends on the results. Other general subjects. 40. Of other general matters a brief summary may be given. Dr. Dobson stillmaintains that the licensed vaccinators do the best work, and are most economical; the Local Fund hands are difficult to get and difficult to train. Even when set to work, they are often idle and sometimes unmanageable. The lymph supply from the Sanitary Commissioners of Assam and Bengal was, as a rule, good and sufficient. Both bovine and human lymph were successfully used. &quot;Arm-to-arm&quot; vaccination is being more widely adopted every season. Expenditure. 41. The cost of these extensive vaccinations has been less favourable than in theseason 1884-85. The total cost of paid agency has increased from Rs. 600 to Rs. 633-14, while the number of successful vaccinations performed by them has fallen from 5,783 to 3,405 and the average cost risen from 1 anna 8 pies to 2 annas 11 pies. If the unpaid work is included, there is, however, only a small increase, viz.. 8½ pies each, compared with 7 1/6 pies in 1884-85. Licensed vaccinators show both the best and cheapest work. 42. The real fact is that the licensed vaccinators are local residents who areknown, and have no difficulty in getting the people to yield; whereas the Government vaccinators of all kinds are not well known, and three-fourths of their time is taken up with arguing and waiting instead of vaccinating. So long as the work of the former class can be thoroughly inspected, it should manifestly be encouraged. KÁMRÚP. Superintendence. 43. Dr. J. Mullane, Civil Surgeon of Gauháti, is the Superintendent of Vaccinationfor Kámrúp, and has been in charge during the current season. Working staff Licensed vaccinators in Barpeta have been added to in number without authority. 44. He had under his orders 1 native inspector, 4 Provincial, 1 Municipal, and6 Local Fund vaccinators, 3 Hospital-Assistants, and 22 licensed vaccinators. This is an increase of 3 Local Fund vaccinators, 1 Hospital-Assistant, and 4 licensed vaccinators on the establishment of 1884-85. In respect of the latter class of operators, Dr. Mullane explains that these fourmen were licensed by the Local Board of Barpeta in place of temporary vaccinators who were not available, and that this was done without any reference to the authorities at Gauháti, and as a matter of fact their work has never been inspected or their returns checked. This action on the part of the Barpeta Local Board so entirely contravenes the orders of the Chief Commissioner, conveyed in paragraph 10 of the Resolution on the Report of 1883-84, that it has been specially referred for notice by the Local Government. Results. Licensed vaccinators still largely employed in Kámrúp. Pleas for their continuance. 45. The total of the operations in Kámrúp for the season just closed exhibits agreat increase on the figures of recent years, and much credit is due to Dr. Mullane for the zeal and energy which he has himself shown in vaccination, and which he has also succeeded in infusing into his numer- ous subordinates. The number is 15,754, compared with 9,742 in 1884-85, and those recorded as successful were 13,781, or 87.47 per cent., compared with 8,763, or 89.95 percent. These statistics would be much more satisfactory if it were not for the large proportions(8,027) credited to the licensed vaccinators who are still so generally employed in Kámrúp. In Goálpára, where also this class is popular, Dr. Dobson is careful to explain in his report that their work is as fully supervised as that of the men who receive pay by the month and not by fees on successful results. But no allusion to the quality of the vaccination performed by these men is to be found in the Kámrúp report. All that Dr. Mullane urges in their favour is that the licensed vaccinators, being old and well-known residents, are more successful in persuadingparents and children to undergo vaccination, and that theyare more constant and helpful in subsequent attendance onthe children. These are certainly valuable qualifications, but I am sure Dr. Mullane will
REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. 11 Constant inspection of their work reiter- ated. himself see that they do not touch the main point of adequate protection. The mere fact of payment by fees on successes casts a doubt also on their returns. It cannot be toooften repeated that the licensed vaccinators should be con- stantly inspected. So long as they are doing honest work, they are valuable adjuncts, and their influence and care render them still more so. But once they are left to their own devices, and no means are taken to see they use good lymph and that protection is real, abuses are certain to grow up, and the vaccination which is being spread is only a mischievous delusion. Mode and plan of employment. Lymph supply exceptionally good. Averages of the vaccinators. 46. As usual, the greatest care was taken in beginning the season early, and withan ample store of good lymph. The twelve tubes of English lymph obtained on the 2nd October from the Sanitary Commissioner of Assam were all successful; and from these 12 children more than 100 ivory points were charged, and the district operations commenced. I had an opportunity of inspecting the vaccination in Kámrúp, and found the vesicles in every case healthy and protective. The good quality was maintained until the season closed. Allthe subordinates worked well, although no one in particular is mentioned. The provincial vaccinators had an average of 789, the municipal 774, and the Local Fund men 571 each. The licensed vaccinatorsin Gauháti had an average of 382 cases, and those in Barpeta of 301. The municipal vaccinator at Gauháti had the highest recorded average of successes, with 91.28, and the licensed vaccinators at Barpeta the lowest, with 75.96. Inspection. 47. Inspection has also been very good. The Civil Surgeon verified 2,153 cases,the Hospital-Assistant at Barpeta 207; and the native inspector 5,647, total 8,007. The percentage found success- ful was 86.99, 67.63, and 81.83 respectively; and these figures convey the impression not only of ample inspection, but also that the standard of what is a success is being materially raised. Inoculation No small-pox epidemics. 48. Dr. Mullane is of opinion that inoculation is by no means banished fromKámrúp. He could not say that he had actually traced anyoutbreak of small-pox to this practice; but he discoveredpatients in two villages who were undergoing it, and he infers its existence elsewhere.Small-pox was, however, nowhere prevalent, except an out- break in April and May at that focus of epidemics, Nalbari, on the north bank, where 35 deaths occurred. But the mortality for the whole district in 1885 was only 116, equal to 18 in 100,000 of the population (Census of 1881). Compulsory vaccination in Gauháti. 49. The Gauháti Municipality is one of the compulsory areas under Act V. (B.C.)of 1880. During the season 23 notices were served on heads of families for neglecting to comply with the law, but in only4 of these was it found necessary to prosecute and fine. The more active provisions of thelaw which had been enforced in 1884-85 had a good effect. Tea-gardens. 50. Of vaccination in tea-gardens in this district the report makes no mention.They are few in number, and the population insignificant.Since writing the above the returns have come in, and it appears that only 61 vaccinations were performed, of which 59 were successful. The garden population of Kámrúp during 1885 was 2,915. Examination of prisoners for protection. 51. To give some idea of the extent to which the population is protected, Dr.Mullane examined 150 prisoners on the 31st March. He found 81 had been inoculated, 31 had been vaccinated, 27 had had small-pox, and 11 were unprotected. Expenditure. 52. Lastly, the expenses are summarised in Statement V. Provincial revenues werecharged with Rs. 450 as salaries and Rs. 136 for travelling allowances; the Local Funds paid Rs. 432 and municipal fundsRs. 120 in addition as salaries. The total cost was, therefore, Rs. 1,138, and the average of 6.526 successful vaccinations by paid agents was 2 annas 9½ pies. If, however, the gross total of 13,854 successful vaccinations of the district be counted, the average cost is 1 anna 3¾ pies only. 53. All this is highly satisfactory, and is mainly due to Dr. Mullane's close supervision of details, to adequate inspection, and to the economy observed in the distribution of work. NOWGONG. 54. The annual report is prepared by Mr. McNaught, Civil Medical Officer, who has been in charge the whole season. c2
12 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. Plan of operations. 55. The same plan as in 1884-85 was followed, and the help of influentialMuhammadans obtained to introduce vaccination among the inhabitants of Puranigudam. The prohibition by Gossains has not yet been withdrawn. Working staff. Results. 56. Last season there was a working staff of 14, and the total number of casesreached 10,872. This season there were 17 operators, viz.,Civil Surgeon, Inspector, 3 Provincial, 9 Local Fund,and 3 Hospital-Assistants ; but the total is only 6,819 cases, of which 6,117, or a totalof 89.70 per cent., were successful. The average of the Provincial vaccinators was 716, and of the Local Fund 398. Inspection. 57. The inspection was very complete ; by the Civil Surgeon 1,513 operationswith 78.98 per cent. successful, and by the native inspec- tor 3,146 and 88.23 successful. These figures are exclusive of 778 vaccinations which were performed by the Civil Surgeon and native inspector themselves. In an appendix will be found a memorandum of the duties required of an inspector, which has been drawn up by Mr. McNaught with his usual tact and com- pleteness. A very large proportion of the cases inspected had the full complement of four marks or vesicles. Explanation of decrease this year. 58. In explanation of the decreased number of vaccinations this season, Mr.McNaught states that the children of those classes who are willing have been to a large extent already operated on:whereas no progress has been made in overcoming the prejudices of those who areunwilling, or who are deterred by the fear of the Gossains. Detail of the castes vaccinated. 59. The various castes of the vaccinated are given, viz., 10 Christians, 185Muhammadans, 4.637 Hindus, 471 Doms, 805 Mikirs, 318 Kacharies, 393 Lalungs, total 6,819.Careful training and supervision observed. With marked success in results. 60. Very great pains was taken by the Civil Medical Officer to train the opera- tors thoroughly to inspect the quality of the vaccine pustules, to obtain and maintain pure and healthy lymph,and to see there was no injury done during the maturation. It is believed, in conse- quence, that vaccination in Nowgong is really genuine, and Mr. McNaught has the satisfaction of reporting that for thethird year in succession not a single. case of small-pox has been seen in the town, norhas any outbreak been reported from the district. Protection observed among prisoners and in schools. 61. There is no compulsory area in Nowgong. The amount of protection affordedthe adult population is shown by a random inspection of 60 prisoners. Among them 28 carried the scar of inocula- tion only, 24 were marked with small-pox, seven had been vaccinated, and one was wholly unprotected. Among students in the English school 115 were examined ; of whom 41 had had small-pox, 31 inoculated, 27 vaccinated, and 16 unprotected. In the Vernacular school 89 were examined; with the result that 24 had had small-pox, 16 were inoculated, 19 vaccinated, and 30 were unprotected. In the vital statistics for 1885 there were only 5 deaths from small-pox reported on tea-gardens and 10 in the district. Lymph-supply. 62. The English lymph received from the Sanitary Commissioner of Assam was ofgood quality, and successful in establishing an early and reliable supply. The lymph, both bovine and human,obtained from Dacca, Darjiling, and Almorah, varied in quality ; some was good, butmore failed. Vaccination on tea-gardens. 63. The vaccination on tea-gardens is not at all so general as it ought to be. Inonly half the gardens -of the district was any vaccination done. The total number of operations was 301, with 253 successes. Expenditure and average cost. 64. Out of a budget grant of Rs. 1,190, only Rs. 952 was expended during theseason. Owing to the decrease in the operations, the average cost has risen from 1 anna 7 pies in 1884-85 to 2 annas 7 2/3 pies in 1885-86. Review by the Deputy Commissioner. 65. The Civil Medical Officer's report is forwarded by the Deputy-Commissioner,who remarks on the great benefit to the people from such a continued absence of epidemic small-pox. Mr. Primrose adds that Mr. McNaught has been most assiduous in his attention to the quality of the work, and trusts this will go far to remove prejudices amongst the natives. I have much satisfaction in adding my own testimony to the good work in Nowgong. I went
REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. 13 with Mr. McNaught into the villages about Puranigudam, and all the cases I saw were excellent in type. Mr. McNaught's colloquial acquirements and address increase his influence. DARRANG. 66. The vaccination in this district remained throughout the season under the superintendence of Surgeon R. N. Campbell, M.B., Civil Surgeon of Tezpur. Plan of operations for the season. 67. Operations were properly first begun in and around the sadr station with theearly supply of good English lymph obtained from the Sanitary Commissioner of Assam, and when a sufficiency had been established, the trained vaccinators went on to the more distant areas, viz., 2 to Gohpur, 2 to Bishnath, and 2 to Tezpur. Working staff. More Local Fund vaccinators should be employed. 68. The working staff has been increased from 13 to 14 this season. Two vaccina- tors, paid by Local Funds, were deputed to Bishnath, an area hitherto neglected, which it was necessary should be occupied. The native inspector, sanctioned during the previous season, has been usefully employed. He has not given proof of all the energy and tact requisite, but perhaps will do better with more experience. Dr. Campbell has now an efficient staff of subordinates. Butthe Local Funds might well support three more operators, making three to each of the districts named. Statistics. 69. The remarkable increase to the statistics which took place in 1884-85 has beenmaintained. There were 9,681 primary vaccinations regis- tered, compared with 8,986 last season. There were nosecondary vaccinations. The number found successful was 8,043, or 83.08 per cent.The Provincial vaccinators worked well, four of them having an average exceeding 1,000.The Local Fund employés also did well. Permanent Provincial vaccinator Kasinath Dasis mentioned for zeal and energy all through the season. Inspections. 70. The inspection was also very thorough and good. Dr. Campbell himself inspected1,056 cases, and found 81.25 per cent. successful; while the native inspector verified 3,658, with a percentage of 83.81 successful. I observe, however, that the inspection is confined to Tezpur and Mangaldai only. In future, Dr. Campbell should take Tezpur himself, and the native inspector should give two months each to Bishnath, Gohpur, and Mangaldai. Results. 71. The general results through the district are quite as good as in Nowgong.Dr. Campbell states there is now little or no objection met with around Tezpur, and that in the outlying districts thefear of evil results following it is dying out. Inoculation is being gradually superseded;no outbreaks of small-pox, attributable to its practice, have occurred during the year;there was, in fact, very few deaths from it reported, and certainly no epidemic. No compulsory vaccination. 72. There is no compulsory area under Act V. (B.C.) of 1880 in Darrang; norany municipality. On tea-gardens. 73. The vaccination on tea-gardens is almost wholly under Dr. Campbell's manage- ment, and is done by Government vaccinators. When it is entrusted to the &quot; Doctor-Babu,&quot; the lymph supply is usually wasted and lost, no returns are obtained, and there is no subsequent reliable inspection. Such drawbacks would, no doubt, happen from time to time; but neither the Civil Surgeon nor his staff of operators can vaccinate all the garden coolies without neglecting their proper duties to the people at large. Expenditure. 74. The total cost of vaccination in Darrang was Rs. 1,110-6-0, comprisingRs. 606-6-0 from Provincial, and Rs. 504 from Local Funds. The proportion of the latter expenditure is inadequate, and should be increased by three more vaccinators, as noted in paragraph 68. The average cost of each successful operation was 2 annas 5 ½ pie. This is also too much. Conclusion. 75. The annual report is forwarded with a letter containing certain recommenda-tions for improving and developing registration andinspection in villages. I am always ready to receive sugges- tions of this nature ; but they should be made specially and dealt with promptly. The heads of information necessary for an annual report to Government are printed ; and any district or local requirements should be kept distinct. But Dr. Campbell's successful vaccination, more especially its genuine protective value and thorough inspection, merit full acknowledgment. SIBSÁGAR. 76. This district report is prepared by Mr. Atkins, lately officiating in civil medical charge, and who has now been transferred to the North-Western Provinces. It has the value of being both concise and comprehensive.
14 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. Details of the staff employed. 77. The subordinate staff numbered 13 only in 1884-85. Owing to the supportof the district officer, the Local Boards, and more ample funds, no less than 26 operators took part in the vaccination of 1885-86. These were distributed as follows: at Sibságar sadr station one Civil Medical Officer, one Native Inspector, three Hospital-Assistants, one Provincial, one Municipal, and five Local Board vaccinators; at Jorhát sub-division, one Assistant-Surgeon, one Provincial, one Union, five Local Board vaccinators; at Golághát sub-division, one Hospital-Assistant, one Provincial, one Union, and three Local Board vaccinators. Results 78. The results are proportionate, and exceedingly satisfactory. Last yearMr. Atkins was exhorted to emulate the success of the neighbouring district of Nowgong, but he has excelled it to a remarkable degree. The total of 1884-85 was 4,915, with a successful average of 90.45 per cent. In 1885-86 the numbers have increased to 12,994 operations, of which 12,859 were primary and 135 secondary. Of the primary vaccinations, 11,810, or 91.84 per cent., were successful, and of the secondary, 127, or 94.07 per cent., were successful. The average number of operations, including all ranks, was 500; the Provincial vaccinators heading the list with 796. Inspection. A native inspector of high merit ap- pointed. 79. The inspection was also good, Mr. Atkins having verified in 1,236 cases,Assistant-Surgeon Hari Charan Sen 150, and the native inspector 4,321. The result of their joint supervision is a reported success of nearly 90 per cent., which is fairly reliable. Mr. Atkins writes that he was fortunate in getting an honest, intelligent, and thoroughly competent Assameseas his inspector; and I can of my own knowledge confirm the Civil Medical Officer's opinion. I took the opportunity when at Sibságar in the end of November, to have a number of the children collected, and nothing could be more satisfactory than the entire operation from first to last. The parents brought their children to the roadside with no reluctance: the vaccine pock in most cases was good, plentiful, and uninjured, and the lymph stored in capital order. One can only regret that when so thoroughly experienced, knowledgeable, and painstaking a medical officer is appointed, the inducements of service in the province are inadequate to retain his services. Feelings of the people 80. Mr. Atkins considers that the bulk of the people are not averse to, but ratherappreciate, vaccination. But probably the real fact is that when work is well done it is appreciated, and when it is bad it is rejected. No inoculation was heard of nor any epidemic traced to its practice. Mr. Atkins had great difficulty in abolishing the habit of carrying about old crusts; he insisted on arm-to-arm vaccination pure and simple; and, as an example, suspended one vaccinator for disobedience of orders in this respect. He makes favourable mention, on the other hand, of Hospital-Assistants Amanat Ali and Maniram Das for their energy in spreading vaccination among the Miri villages about Disangmukh. There were only 135 recorded deaths from small-pox in this district during 1885, being at the small ratio of 36 in 100,000 of the population. &quot; Lymph supply. 81. The supply of lymph was, as usual, from the Sanitary Commissioners of Bengal,the North-West Provinces, and Assam. The ten tubes of English stock from the latter were &quot; eminently successful.&quot; The supply from Almora, Darjiling, and Calcutta was not always reliable. A small portion was sent to the American Missionaries at Molungting in the Nága Hills, but the result is not stated. Tea-gardens. 82. The vaccination on the numerous tea-gardens of Sibságar is also unrecorded.It was started on some twenty or thirty, but only four gardens, returning 168 operations, gave in any results. Expenses. 83. The cost of the establishment was Rs. 1,244, of which Rs. 382 was drawn fromProvincial revenues, Rs. 714 from Local, and Rs. 160 from Municipal Funds. The average cost of each successful vaccination was one anna and 9 ¼ pies only. This is also highly satisfactory. Good services of Mr. Atkins. 84. Mr. Atkins has been transferred to a more congenial climate and station inIndia, but the energy and ability which he manifested in every branch of his department during his short stay at Sibságar will long be remembered; and it is to be hoped the benefit to the people of all classes in that district will be lasting. I have much pleasure in bringing his merits to the notice of the Chief Commissioner of Assam.
REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. 15 LAKHIMPUR. Superintendence. 85. The vaccination in this district has been under Dr. Whitwell's superintendencethroughout the season 1885-86. In North Lakhimpur the operations were watched by Dr. Cran, who is in medical charge of the sub-divisional station, and the local vaccinators received their first instruc- tions from him. Working plan. 86. The plan pursued was the same as in former years. After proof of capabilityeach vaccinator has a definite area assigned to his working, receives periodical supplies of lymph, and reports progress or difficulties, as the case may be. Staff employed. 87. There were altogether 11 officers employed, viz., the Civil Surgeon, four Provin- cial, four Local Fund, and one municipal vaccinator, and one Hospital-Assistant. Dr. Whitwell himself, being engaged inthe study of Assamese to qualify for his permanent appointment, was obliged to leavevaccination to the subordinates. Results. 88. Nevertheless, the statistics are, on the whole, good. The total number of caseswas 8,005, all primary; and of these 6,567, or 82.03 per cent., were reported successful. No one over six years of age was vaccinated. Inspection. 89. Inspection was nominal only; the Civil Surgeon examined 157, of whichhe found 142, or 90.44 per cent., successful. He was too much engaged on other duties, as explained in paragraph 18, to devote his attention to this. But it is quite as necessary in Lakhimpur as elsewhere. Native inspector should be appointed. 90. The Local Board should be pressed to increase the number of vaccinators byat least three more, as the district area is so extensive; and an application should be submitted for sanction to employa Native Inspector in terms of Chief Commissioner's Resolution, Vaccination Report1883-84, paragraph 14. Expenditure. 91. The cost of the establishment is moderate. From Provincial revenues Rs. 450was paid in salaries, and Rs. 207 as travelling allowance; Local Funds contributed Rs. 325 pay and Rs. 96 travelling allowance, and the Dibrugarh municipality Rs. 90. The total was Rs. 1,170-5-6 and the average cost of each successful operation within a fraction of 3 annas. Wages are high in Lakhimpur. If a native inspector is obtained, the additional expense can only be authorised on the promise of a larger working staff and a greatly increased outturn of vaccination. Tea-gardens 92. The returns from tea-gardens in this district are very incomplete. Among some40,000 labourers and their families only 750 vaccinations by Government agency were reported, of which 581 were successful ; and 269, with 247 successful, were reported as due to garden medical officers. General remarks. 93. There was no serious outbreak of small-pox anywhere. Inoculation is becomingmore discountenanced each year; many of the prejudices against vaccination are being slowly removed, and work is making real progress; the statistics of vaccination in the compulsory area has been noticed elsewhere. The lymph supply received at the commencement of the season from the Sanitary Commissioner of Assam, was alone successful; later supplies in tubes and crusts, both human and bovine, forwarded periodically from Bengal were of variable quality. NÁGA HILLS. Decrease in the numbers in the Nága Hills. The permanent provincial vaccinator an expensive arrangement. 94. Vaccination in the Nága Hills is not making much progress. Thereis one vaccinator paid from Provincial funds, who received Rs. 15 a month all the year round, and also drew Rs. 23 for travelling allowances and for an interpreter. He performed 8 operations, of which 6 were successful, so that his average presents the unique figure of nearly Rs. 34 for each success. He was ill from November to February; but it was pointed out in the Vaccination Report of 1884-85, that he ought to be at work all the year in the hills.Dr. Borah ought not to permit such continued uselessness and extravagance. Besides the above individual, the Civil Surgeon and the Hospital-Assistants at Wokha and Kohima took a small share in vacci- nation : but the real working man seems to be Sewchurn, dresser of the Kohima dispensary. Out of a total of 495 cases, he vaccinated 377, with 323, or 85.67 per cent., successful. General remarks. 95. There is not much more that is worthy of record. Among the 495 vaccinatedwere 17 Angámi, 377 Lhotas, and 101 other classes. Mr. Greer, Deputy-Commissioner, relates the fact of the gaonbura
16 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. The gaonbura of Mozema vaccinated. of Mozema, who was under arrest at Kohima, hearing that small-pox had broken outin his village, came forward voluntarily, and was vaccinated; but his example does not appear to have been of much use. Protection by police is now withdrawn. Lymph supply generally good. 96. Dr. Borah explains the serious decreas [NLS note: poor quality text appears here and has been omitted REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. 17 Results 106. The contrast between the work carried on in the Gáro Hills with that done in the Khási Hills is very great . Six vaccinators in the former have an average of 1,270.5 cases; and the total of the district is 7,637, of which 7,320, or 95.85 per cent., were successful. Although this total is less than the figures of 1884-85, it is a substantial record, and is creditable to Dr. Gupta's first year of superintendence. The whole district has now been thoroughly searched, and Dr. Gupta explains that the numbers are not likely to be maintained in future, as ground already occupied must next year be gone over again. Inspection 107. The inspection has also been very good. The Civil Surgeon verified 2,671 cases himself, and reports 92.66 per cent good. Two ripened pocks, or their scars, were required as the evidence of ample protection, except in children under one year, in whom one was sufficient. General remarks. 108. I am pleased to observe also that the vaccination was not desultory and fitful. The excellent system introduced by Mr. Mc- Naught of having limited areas completely worked, has been carried out by his successor. The Gáros have taken kindly to the practice, and render every possible aid to the operators in its successful performance. Moreover, the practice of inoculation has entirely ceased in these hills, and there have been no outbreaks of small-pox attributable to it. There was one epidemic at village Gabul, in which 17 persons were attacked, but the disease was communicated by a family which had migrated thither from the Khási Hills. The provincial vaccinator was at once ordered to Gabul, operated on 58 who were unprotected, and arrested the further spread of the disease. Lymph supply 109. The periodical supplies of lymph from Darjiling and Dacca were good, the tubes of English lymph received from the Sanitary Com- missioner of Assam unusually so. 110. There are no tea-gardens in this district nor any compulsory areas. Expenditure 111. The cost of this establishment has been moderate, compared with results, viz., Rs. 462 in salaries and Rs. 374 in travelling allow- ance, the average being 1 anna 9¾ pies for each success- ful case. It is all paid from Provincial revenues. Dr. Gupta should bring to notice the names of his subordinates who have done particularly good work.. 112. The registration of the Gáro Hills is limited to Tura station, with a popu- lation of 744 in 1881. In this community no case of small-pox occurred. SYLHET. Superintendence 113. Vaccination in Sylhet has continued throughout the season under the super- intendence of Dr. J. W. Macnamara, Civil Surgeon. He has written a full and careful report, which is reviewed by Mr. Stevenson, Deputy-Commissioner, in his usual able and considerate manner. Subordinates employed 114. The number of operators was increased from 36 in 1884-85 to 46, viz., 19 in the sadr division, 6 in Sunáinganj sub-division, 5 in Maulavi Bázár, 10 in Habiganj, and 6 in Karimganj. The staff comprised 1 Civil Surgeon, 1 native inspector, and 1 assistant native inspector, 10 provincial, 2 municipal, and 21 Local Fund vaccinators, 6 Hospital-Assistants, 3 com- pounders, and 1 licensed vaccinator. The increase is altogether in the Local Fund class. Results 115. The result has been a considerable increase on the figures of 1884-85. In that season the total was 18,818 cases and 18,341, or 97.46, successful, while in this the aggregate is 25,015 cases, of which 24,917 were primary and 98 secondary. Among the former 23,529, or 94.42 per cent., and among the latter 95, or 96.93 per cent., are said to have been successful. Protective value of &quot;successes&quot; discussed 116. Although this successful proportion is something less than previously, it is still much greater than obtains elsewhere in Assam, especially in more manageable districts and under thorough superior observation. Dr. Macnamara believes such a proportion is reasonable, that it is supported by the statistics of his hand-book, and is borne out by the results of his personal inspection. But I must repeat what was entered in last year's report, that it is inconsistent with general careful observations elsewhere, and even by other operators at his own doors; that it is unlikely to be maintained under the conditions of new hands and uncertain lymph so frequently reported by himself as difficulties; and that such practical objections ought to be his guide, rather than the results of an expert in more favourable countries and climates with every convenience and aid to the success of each operation.
18 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. Inspections. A third native inspector for South Sylhet is needed. 117. The only inspection reported is by the Civil Surgeon, who verified 1,492 cases, and reports 1,457, or 97.65 per ent., of these to have been successful and by the native inspectors, who report 16,866, with 16,490, or 97.77 per cent, as being successful. The Hospital-Assistant of the sadr dispensary is also engaged as a native inspector for the town of Sylhet, and received Rs. 150 honorarium for this duty; but the tables do not show what share of the work, if any, that he did. The figures of the two native inspectors are certainly open to doubt. In no other district has one of these officers compassed half the total of inspections for which credit is claimed in Sylhet; and, admitting that the population of Sylhet is comparatively dense and the villages close together, an average of nearly 120 inspections for each working day is surprising. There ought to be a third native inspector for South Sylhet. Habigánj and Maulavi Bázár have 15 local employes and an application for an inspector, with his head-quarters at the former station, would be favourably recommended. Average work of each class. 118. The average work done by each class of vaccinators is, on the whole, very good. In Karimganj four Local Fund men performed 4,032 operations, and in the sadr division 10 provincial vaccinators had an average of 970 each. Hospital-Assistant Kamini Kumar Chakravarti at Maulavi Bázár is specially commended by Dr. Macnamara. Compulsory area results. 119. The municipal limits of the town of Sylhet are a compulsory area under Act V. (B.C.) of 1880. The population- by the Census of 1881 was 14,407, but it is to a certain extent fluctuating. The municipal vaccinator, who receives pay all the year at Rs. 10 monthly, performed 245 operations, with 218, or 88.97 per cent., successful. His average value is, therefore, 8 annas 9 ¾ pies each. Attention has been before drawn to the inadequacy of this man's work. During the season 168 persons were reported under Section 18 of the Act. Of these, 133 obeyed the Magistrate's orders, 8 were non-suited, and 27 prosecuted, of whom 15 were convicted. Consideration by the local authorities is invited to the fact that the municipal vaccinator's work is at the rate of only three operations in two days; and that, although the births in the township registered during 1885 were only 253, or seven in excess of the vaccinations, the former is notoriously defective, being at the ratio of 17.56 per thousand on the Census population of 1881. It is almost certain that both birth registration and vaccination represent only about half the requirements of the Act, and the plea of the Civil Surgeon that the intelligent classes in Sylhet object on various grounds to vaccination has no bearing in a compulsory area. On tea-gardens. 120. Vaccination on tea-gardens continues, as hitherto, in a very indifferent state. The Deputy-Commissioner writes that many managers view it with disfavour, as tending to unsettle the coolies and to desertions. Out of a coolie population in Sylhet which stood on the 31st December 1885 at 50,559, the aggregate number of first vaccinations was 1,507, of which 881, or 58.46 per cent., were successful. But this proportion of primary vaccination is much greater than in the compulsory area of Sylhet itself. On this subject I would invite attention to the remarks in paragraphs 20 and 21 of the Vaccination Report of 1884-85. Expenditure. 121. The cost in Sylhet has risen from Rs. 1,904 in 1883-84, and Rs. 2,086 in 1884-85, to Rs. 3,284-12 in 1885-86. The increase represents entirely additional establishments. The results are not proportionate, as the average cost has steadily increased from 1 anna 9 pies to 1 anna 11¼ pies, and this year to 2 annas 3 pies. Of the total sum, Provincial revenues contributed Rs. 1,537, made up of Rs. 1,050 in salaries, and Rs. 487 travelling allowance; Local Funds added Rs. 1,427, and the remaining Rs. 320 was paid by the municipality of Sylhet. Of the increased charge of the season, viz., Rs. 1,198, the greater portion, viz., Rs. 928, has been provided from Local Funds; Provincial revenue has contribu- ted Rs. 280 more, and the municipality Rs. 10 less than in 1884-85. Here it should be mentioned that the advisability of retaining vaccinators on half pay during the recess months has commended itself to the Local Boards in Sylhet generally ; so that an improve- ment may be expected in the progress of vaccination during the early weeks of the work- ing season, in the qualifications of the operators, and in the influence which their residence and experience will bring to bear on prejudices. Conclusion. 122. I beg to express my acknowledgments to Mr. Stevenson for the careful and complete review with which the district report is forwarded; and also to Dr. Macnamara for his able superintendence of so large and often troublesome a body of subordinates. Another inspector for South Sylhet is necessary; the vaccinators ought not to lose time by wandering over the country looking for good places, but should each have a definite area allotted to them,
REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. 19 and be forbidden to leave it, except under superior orders; above all, a higher standard of what constitutes protective vaccination should be established. I was disappointed in not seeing any vaccination during my inspection of Sylhet this year. I had allotted ten days to the district, and hoped to have got down south to Maulavi Bázár by land, and to have seen vaccination in the villages en route. But although I had given ample notice of my visit and its principal object, I found the vaccinators absent, no knowledge of their precise locality, and very indefinite views of inspection generally. In common with the Province at large, Sylhet was particularly free from small-pox in 1885. Only 683 deaths were registered, compared with 2,646 in 1884, and 2,584 in 1883. Dr. Macnamara inspected a school at Rainagar, and among 75 boys found that 50 had been inoculated, 4 had had small-pox, and 21 were vaccinated. CACHAR. Superintendence. 123. Dr. T. D'O. Partridge, Civil Surgeon, has been Superintendent of Vaccination throughout the season. This is the first year in which the duty has been taken by him in this district; but he has had considerable previous experience in Dibrugarh and Sibságar. Subordinate staff. 124. He had under his orders a staff of 15 operators, including one native inspector, 3 Provincial, 1 Municipal, and 6 Local Fund vaccinators, 3 Hospital-Assistants, and 1 compounder. This is a valuable addition to the working party of 1884-85, and is no doubt due to the commendable interest shown in vaccination by Mr. Kennedy, Deputy-Commissioner. The increase consisted of 1 native inspector, 3 Local Fund vaccinators, and 2 Hospital-Assistants. Results 125. Their combined operations have been most successful; and Mr. Kennedy, in forwarding the report, attributes the results as entirely due to Dr. Partridge taking a keen interest and in organising the work in all parts of the district. In 1884-85 there was a total of 8,089 vaccinations, of which 6,151 were successful. In 1885-86, the totals are 12,984 and 11,064 respectively. These figures include the work done on tea-gardens, which seems to be peculiarly successful and unique in Cachar. During this season 3,753 vaccinations took place there; and of these 2,783, or 74.15 per cent., were good and protective. Averages of successes 126. From Statement II. of the district report it is clear that all the operators worked with energy, but in Hailákándi sub-division the average is excellent. The proportion of successes varies from a maximum of 94.59 per cent. to 80. There must be something wrong about these averages, they ought to approach very closely in all the sub-divisions of one district and under one inspection, if only a uniform standard of what constitutes &quot; success&quot; is maintained. But this is just where the system fails. One officer judges a success what another would register as failure. Inspections. 127. Inspections also show a marked improvement. Last season there was none to speak of, but this season the Civil Surgeon has verified 942, and the native inspector 3,752; with a success- ful average recorded above 90 per cent. Lymph supply. 128. The lymph supply is reported to have been variable, but Mr. Kennedy writes that complaints were less frequent than hitherto. Of the English supply, four tubes only, out of 10, were good. Inoculation. 129. Dr. Partridge is of opinion that inoculation is still general ; but he has only the evidence of certain villagers, who say they prefer it to vaccination. On the other hand, none appears to have been actually discovered, and no outbreaks of small-pox were attributable to it during the year. There was, in fact, no prevalence of the disease any where in Cachar ; the deaths registered in 1885 having been 36 only, and the proportion 12 in every 100,000 of the population. Protection averages among school boys 130. There is no compulsory area under Act V. (B.C.) of 1880. Of 443 school- boys examined, 206 were found inoculated, 195 vaccinated 27 had had small-pox, and 15 were altogether unprotected, being the small ratio of 3.39 per cent. These figures are somewhat surprising; they would have had more value if Dr. Partridge had mentioned that the boys had been examined by himself, unselected, and without previous notice; and, after all, they represent probably a sadr school of a municipality where a local vaccinator has been employed for years, and has influence among the educated classes. What is required is to collect the same statistics from half a dozen páthsálas in the rural areas of each sub-division. D2
20 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. Tea-gardens 131. 3,780 persons were vaccinated on tea-gardens by Provincial and Local Fund vaccinators. I am not quite sure that such an extensive appropriation of public servants is contemplated; the under- standing is that lymph only should be distributed, and the actual work left to garden doctors; but Cachar seems always to have claimed Government aid in this form, and it is the only district in which vaccination on tea-gardens is considerable. Of 179 gardens, returns were received from 123. Expenditure. 132. The expenditure in Cachar amounted to Rs. 1,046-5-3, of which Provincial Funds paid Rs. 383 in salaries and Rs. 157 in travelling allowance. Local Funds paid Rs. 450, and Municipal Funds Rs. 56. The average cost of each successful vaccination, inclusive of those performed on tea-gardens by public operators, was 2 annas. Acknowledgment of good services in Cachar. 133. The results in Cachar for the past season are the highest on record, and Dr. Partridge is to be congratulated on having so quickly reor- ganized the district operations and disseminated vaccination so extensively and economically, while acknowledgments are also due to Mr. Kennedy, Deputy-Commissioner, and the members of the Local Board for the increased funds available and for the general assistance given to the work. GENERAL REMARKS. Inoculation Employment of ex-inoculalors Payments by results in the Punjab. 134. There would seem to be little doubt but that inoculation is losing ground in Assam. The tenor of nearly all the Civil Surgeon's remarks is to this effect. The professional inoculators are mostly Bengali immigrants, and their time of business corresponds very nearly to the busiest time of the vaccinators. The two classes cannot work together, or unknown to each other; and Dr. Dobson lays particular stress on the fact that the licensed vaccinators, who were formerly inoculators, have their living to make, and would very soon inform against any opposition. In South Sylhet, the Local Board employed unofficially two or three ex-inoculators and paid them by results, viz., 3 annas each the first hundred and 2 annas each in excess. In the Resolution of the Honourable the Lieutenant-Governor on the Punjab Vaccination Report for 1884-85, it is noticed that in Dera Ismail Khan &quot;an effort is being made to extend vaccination by the entertainment of local vaccinators instead of outsiders, who are to be paid by results at the rate of one anna for each successful operation, and a small reward of 2 to 4 pies to each mother from whose child lymph may be taken.&quot; There seems, however, to be no lack of customers in Goálpára, who pay the local men at the rate of 2 annas, instead of being paid one anna, and, where the population is fairly plentiful and transit easy, as in South Sylhet, this system should at least be tried in the beginning, Progress in the feelings of the natives owards vaccination. 135. The district reports touch slightly on the feeling of the natives regarding vaccination. &quot;'In general it is passive acquiescence, and, as heretofore, accepted more or less unwillingly. But in some places the people do seem to understand its protective value, and are growing accustomed to the regular seasonal visit. There are still considerable sections of the population who are entirely under the influence of the priesthood, and dare not be vaccinated even if they wished it. Not a single Superintendent mentions his having received assistance from a native of any rank or education. In this respect the practice of the Punjab Government might be copied with advantage. Commendatory certificates are given to those who interest themselves in the cause of vaccination. These certificates are ordinarily signed by the Sanitary Commissioner. Very special services are to be reported to Government for the grant of sanads signed by a Secretary; or, if the services have been of altogether exceptional merit, by the Lieutenant-Governor. Improved accuracy and genuine vaccination of the year. 136. In the review of last season's operations it was remarked (paragraph 34) that the two points of vaccination in Assam which stand out prominently under the increase of late years, are the accuracy of the statistics, and the genuine protective character of the vaccine pock. In both respects I am satisfied that in nearly all the districts the Civil Surgeons, as Superintendents, entered on the current season's operations with an earnest willingness, not only to extend vaccination, but to improve its character by careful inspection, and to check the registers of the operators as often as possible, and I believe with fairly good results. In several townships, and even in whole districts, there has now been no severe epidemic of small-pox since 1883-84, and the immunity has been particularly marked in those which have had the advantage of careful supervision and systematic vaccination.
REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. 21 Medical officers' services acknowledged. 137. During this year, Dr. Partridge at Cachar, Dr. Mullane at Gauháti, Dr. Campbell at Tezpur, and Mr. Atkins at Sibságar have been particularly active and successful, and their exertions merit acknowledgment. Review of last seasons Report by the Government of India. 138. The review of the Report for 1884-85, and of the Chief Commissioner's Resolu- tion thereon, by the Government of India is contained in Home Department (Sanitary) No. 339, dated Calcutta, the 2nd December 1885, and was received in this office on the 28th idem. It notices with encouragement the successful efforts made by Local Boards in Assam to promote vaccination in their respective areas. A.

To examine the vaccinator as to his acquaintance and compliance with the procedure laid down in the rules for performing vaccination and to instruct him when deficient. He should, if possible, see the vaccinator perform vaccination, so that any error may be corrected. He should encourage him to to careful and good work. To vaccinate as many himself as can conveniently be done, and show the vaccinator the proper procedure. To explain the nature of vaccination and its many advantages to the people, and encourage them to accept it. To keep up and submit to the Civil Surgeon a half-monthly diary. This should be carefully filled lp and he should clearly note the number of successful vaccinations performed by each vaccinator separately, and the number of those seen by himself. He should be provided with vaccine instruments, registers and forms, and a supply of good lymph. He should at once remedy any defect found in the quality of lymph or in the vaccine operation generally. He should keep a separate list of persons in each mauza who refuse vaccination, their village, Gosain, caste, and reason for refusing also being clearly stated, and submit it with his diary.

Resolution on the Vaccination Report for 1885-86. Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner of Assam in the General Department, No. 4,830, dated Shillong, the 19th August 1886. READ(2) extension of vaccination in Sibságar is due to the exertions of Dr. Atkins, who has unfortunately been transferred from the province since the close of the year. In Nowgong, the reason alleged for the decrease is that the ground open to vaccination has been, worked out, and only the exclusive castes remain, who obey the dictates of their Gohains in refusing vaccination; but it is too early yet to fall back upon an excuse of this kind. It may possibly have some force in the Gáro Hills, with their small population, where the protection afforded is already so effective that there were no deaths from small- pox in 1885-86, and only one outbreak, which was stopped at once by a vaccinator going out and vaccinating the whole village. The decrease in Goálpára is not explained. If following the statistics of the Census Report of 1881 we assume that population increases yearly at the rate of 3 per cent. in Cachar and Lakhimpur, at the rate of 2 per cent. in Sibságar and Nowgong, and at 1½ per cent. elsewhere, then the following table shows in round numbers the number of vaccinations necessary in order to keep pace with the growth of population:( 3 ) percentage (97.8), that raises the general average in inspectors' cases above that of cases inspected by Civil Surgeons. The Chief Commissioner is glad to find that the tendency to overestimate the success of vaccination is not universal among native inspectors. Dr. Eteson comments on the great variety exhibited in their estimates. It ought to be possible for Civil Surgeons to teach these men some few plain rules to regulate their judgment. The Sibságar, Goálpára, and Sylhet figures seem to show that inspectors are ready enough to take the cue from their official superiors, and to follow any standard which the Civil Surgeon himself adopts. Cases inspected by Civil Surgeons were not only somewhat more numerous than last year (15,336 against 14,788), but they were far better distributed, every Civil Surgeon in the province taking a fair share in the work, except in Lakhimpur, where Dr. Whitwell is said to have had much of his time taken up in reading for his examination in Assamese. Last year two-fifths of the total number of Civil Surgeons' inspections were due to the single district of Goálpára. Cases tested by native inspectors nearly doubled their numbers (43,558 against 22,225 in 1884-85), but the number of inspectors themselves has been increased from 5 to 8 by adding men in Tezpur, Sibságar, and Silchar. There is now an inspector in every plains district, except Sylhet, which has two, and Lakhimpur, where none has yet been provided. The Nowgong man did less inspection work than last year: elsewhere the old inspectors bettered their record, and the three new men show a fair average. Sylhet is the district where the average stands highest, the two inspectors having tested 16,866 cases between them. Goálpára and Kámrúp come next. The comparative density of population is probably the main cause of these differences. Vaccination staff. 6. The departmental staff of all kinds in each district during 1885-86 has been as follows:( 4 ) Provincial vaccinators. No per vaccinator. * Darrang........................ 1,108 Cachar........................ 1,015 Khási Hills........................ 1,385 Gáro (5) cases respectively, giving averages of 383 and 301 cases per man in each sub-division. In Goálpára, the licensed vaccinators are no less carefully supervised than the regular paid vaccinators, but there still seems to be a want of proper supervision in Kámrúp. This is a point which should be pressed upon the Civil Surgeon's attention. During 1885-86, 4 new men in Barpeta were added by the local board, notwithstanding the injunctions which have repeatedly been given against any addition to this class of vaccina- tors in Kámrúp without the Sanitary Commissioner's consent. The attention of the Deputy-Commissioner will be drawn to the remarks on this subject in paragraph 45 of Dr. Eteson's report, and timely notice should be given of any future action of this kind contemplated by a local board. The extremely poor work done by these four Barpeta men is in itself the strongest proof that supervision ought to be stricter. There are certain undeniable advantages in employing this class of operators, under proper guarantees. Dr. Dobson in Goálpára finds them much more efficient than the local board vaccinators, being at once keener for work (they are paid according to the number of successful cases) and possessed of that local interest and influence in which the paid hands are generally deficient. But all this is in a great measure the result of a strict and regular system of supervision, such as must now be introduced into Kámrúp. It will never do to depend for one-half the vaccination of the district upon men whose work is never tested, and cannot be trusted. Next year's report should show the number of licensed vaccinators' operations which have been tested by the Civil Surgeon and by the Inspector. A larger individual average of work must be got out of these men, and it may, perhaps, be worth considering whether a special inspector should not be entertained to look after this army of licensed vaccinators, or ex-inoculators, as in this district they better deserve to be called. Supply of lymph. 11. The Sanitary Commissioner procured 125 tubes of lymph from England, and distributed them, at the rate of ten to a district, before the season began. They generally proved very good. Lymph was also indented for directly by Civil Surgeons from the depôts at Dacca, Calcutta, Darjiling, and Almora, and turned out to be of variable quality. On the whole, the English lymph seems to be decidedly superior. The only exceptions occurred in Cachar, where six of the ten tubes were failures, and in Shillong, where, for some unexplained reason, all the ten proved useless. This is particularly provoking, because vaccination in the Khási Hills, after a long and seemingly hopeless struggle with the conservative prejudices of this very obstinate hill people, has suddenly taken a great start within the last two years. The average number of vaccinations among the Khásis used to be about 1,800 annually; in 1884-85 the number rose to 3,659, and in 1885-86 to 4,279. Two successive outbreaks of small- pox in these two years have apparently frightened the Khásis out of their superstitions fof the time being. Further progress may be hoped for; but the first condition is that vacci- nation should be effectual, i.e., that the operators should have good lymph to work with. Financial statistics. 12. The following table gives a comparative view of the cost of vaccination during each of the past two years. The salaries of Civil Surgeons and of the Sanitary Commissioner are not reckoned in these figures :ANNUAL VACCINATION REPORT OF THE PROVINCE OF ASSAM FOR THE Season 1886-87. BY A.

There has been no change introduced during the year either in the sources of lymph or in the class of operators. The tables and the general plan of the report are also the same as heretofore. Sources of lymph. 2. There were 150 tubes of English lymph received through the Sanitary Com- missioner with the Government of India on the 28th Sep- tember 1886, and distributed without delay in proportion to the size of each district. With this first stock the Civil Surgeons began local production, and this was supplemented all through the season by periodical supplies from the depots in Dacca, Darjiling, Calcutta, and Almora. Quality of the lymph. 3. Very especial pains has been taken of late years to secure the purity and genuineness of the vaccine medium. It was recognized that, naturally, one of the main difficulties in the way of winning the people's confidence would gradually disappear if the absolute protective quality of vaccination was fairly established, that in order to secure this the utmost care must be taken to establish healthy vaccination only, regardless of figures, and to support it by adequate inspection. It is impossible as yet to say that any material results have affected the Provincial population at large, but the statistics of mortality from small-pox have now been unusually small for the last three years, and there is frequent mention in the district reports that the confidence of the people is being slowly gained, and that in many places there would be no difficulty in extending the provisions of Act V. of 1880 to the general population.

In the above table is exhibited in very laborious detail the share taken in vaccination by the working staff at each station or district centre. Briefly, it may be summarised that the Civil Surgeons vaccinated 1,030 persons; the Hospital-Assistants and compounders 3,114; Inspectors 1,435; provincial vaccinators 41,246; municipal vaccinators 4,161; Local Fund vaccinators 55,076; and licensed vaccinators 15,838. The average number to each person of the classes named in the above order will be 128.75, 72.42, 179.37, 982.05, 462.33, 744.27, and 521.27. By Civil Surgeons 7. The number of vaccinations performed by Civil Surgeons individually has dimi- nished considerably. In 1884-85 it was 2,667, in 1885-86 1,192, and in 1886-87 it is only 1,030. Drs. Mullane, Campbell, and Whitwell are, in fact, the only ones who appear to make any practice of it. The general excuse is that inspection of tea-gardens is becoming every year more exacting and laborious, and interferes with their own proper duties. This is to be regretted. If Dr. Macnamara has to inspect tea-gardens at such an expense of time, he might at least take a few fresh &quot; points,&quot; and improve the occasion by vaccination also. Hospital-Assistants and Compounders 8. None of the Hospilal-Assistants have vaccinated energetically. Dwarkanath Shome, of Mangaldai, is the best as usual, with 237 cases; but this is a great falling off from 422 in 1885 86. Naturally, the example of Civil Surgeons has been followed by their immediate subordinates. At Kohima, Compounder Sew Charan, with 648, has worked well under many difficulties; and at Mangaldai Rámesvar Dás, with 660, has also an excellent record. In both instances, the Civil Surgeon should endeavour to obtain a suitable gratuity to each from the local authorities. Native Inspectors. 9. Of eight native Inspectors, two, viz., Mehajan Ali at Nowgong (636) and Debánando at Sibságar (611) have done well. Elsewhere. Inspectors have done very little actual vaccination. Dr. Campbell at Tezpur explains that he does not approve of their being so engaged. It keeps them at one place when they ought to be moving. He adds that any vaccinations actually performed by them he has included in the local operations. I agree with his views in this respect.
REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. 5 Provincial vaccinators Municipal ditto Local Fund ditto Licensed ditto 10. The local vaccinators constitute the great body of operators in the Province; collectively numbering 74, and accounting for 55,076 vacci- nations. The Provincial vaccinators are by far the most able of this class, being generally men of experience and local influence. There are 42 altogether, and their record is an average of 982 each. In Sylhet ten have an average of 1,177 each. Of course, populous districts give much larger averages. The nine municipal vaccinators have an average of 462, which is a further decrease on the statistics of 1885-86. These men are a lazy set, getting their pay too easily. Sylhet has again the laziest man in the laziest class. It would be an excellent move if these men were paid by results for a year or two. One is so paid already by the municipality in South Sylhet. The municipal vaccinator at Sibságar is the only one of nine who earns his pay under the present system. The 74 Local Fund vaccinators have a fair average of 744 each ; last year the figures were 70 and 638. Their work is often greatly hindered by exposure, sickness, distances to travel, new faces, and objections. The 30 licensed vaccinators are paid principally by results, receiving two annas for each successful case. Under this system each achieved an average of 521 operations, but of only 488 successes, which represent Rs. 61. I am rather at a loss to understand how Dr. Dobson finds applications for licenses so numerous that they actually prefer to work on this system to regular wages ; unless, as is only too likely, the two-annas fee is taken both at operation and at cure. Percentage of successful operations in each class 11. The success attending operations by each class is not given in the preceding table, but can be found in Provincial Statement III., printed at page 23. It is unfortunate that what constitutes a &quot; successful operation &quot; is nowhere precisely defined, and hence we meet with considerable variations in the proportions. Dr. Macnamara is of opinion that &quot; a successful operation &quot; means that the virus has been communicated, and has &quot; taken. &quot; The development of the vesicle and its ultimate protective value are not taken into account, and he cites in support his personal inspection of a vaccinator's register, which he found correct, and in which there were only 26 failures in 745 entries. There can be no reasonable doubt but that some men are more and some less conscientious in respect of their view as to successful operations. Taken as they stand together in the Provincial tables, Civil Surgeons show an average of 88.57 per cent. of successes, Hospital-Assistants and compounders of 86.69 per cent.; local vaccinators of all classes 92.57 ; and licensed vaccinators of 92.60 per cent. ; and this is very much in harmony with Mr. Knox Wight's remarks:6 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. Statistics of inspections. 12. The important subject of inspection is tabulated above. It may be remembered that, owing to an increase in the staff specially sanctioned at my earnest recommendation for each plains district except Lakhimpur, the number of inspections in 1885-86 nearly doubled the proportions verified in 1884-85, reaching 51 per cent. This season the inspecting staff has not been increased, but there has been a slight falling off in the numbers verified, the 59,044, or 51 per cent., of 1885-86 falling to 58,556, or 48 per cent., of 1886-87. The total is made up by 15,671 inspections by Civil Surgeons, 3,241 by Hospital-Assistants, and 39,644 by native Inspectors. The latter are, of course, specially told off for this duty. Among the Civil Surgeons, Dr. Dobson is by far the most persevering, his figure being 3,927 and the highest on record. Mr. McNaught, Assistant-Surgeon Annada Prasad Ghosh, and Dr. Mullane are also commendable. The total of this column (15,671) forms a slight advance only on the figures, 15,336, of 1885-86. I cannot quite understand why Dr. Whitwell has so retrograded. In 1883-84 he found time to verify 3,301 vaccinations, but this season only 547. He was, at all events, not occupied with the study of Assamese. Among the Inspectors, Mahajan Ali at Nowgong and Thaku Ram at Darrang have been particularly energetic. The Inspector of Goálpára on the other hand, has dropped from 6,168 to 3,219. Dr. Dobson should see to this. Results. 13. The gross number of successful and unsuccessful operations are given in columns 2 and 3, but these can be more succinctly understood by reference to column 4 in which the rate per cent of each is enumerated. It will be seen that the average of successful operations by all the Civil Surgeons is 88.82; by the Hospital-Assistants 92.32, and by the Inspectors 91.92. In each class, the bulk of the vaccination occurring in Sylhet, the average success is heavily loaded by the theoretical successes still supported in that district. Inspection of licensed vaccinators 14. The continued employment of this class, formerly known as ex-inoculators, has been prohibited, except under close supervision, and the Chief Commissioner, in the Resolution accompanying last year's report (paragraph 10) requires that their operations, as tested by the Civil Surgeons and the Inspectors, shall be shown separately. Briefly, the following are the facts. There were 30 licensed vaccinators, as compared with 32 in 1885-86, and the total num- ber of their operations amounted to 15,838. Of these, 14,666 are said to have been success- ful, equal to a general average of 92.60, or very nearly the average of all ranks for the season, viz., 92.32. In Goálpára, 11 men were employed, who performed 8,489 times, and of these 5,690 were inspected, with 90.21 average of successes. In fact, so far as the tables show, both Dr. Dobson and his Inspector devoted by far the greatest share of their time to this duty, and the licensed men did over two-thirds of all the vaccination in the district. In Gauháti, there were 18 men of this class employed, and their work is represented by 6,982 operations out of a district total of 14,653. The Inspector alone was overlooking, and reported 2,150 verified, with an average of 82.28 successful. In Darrang there was one young apprentice employed, who had formerly practised as an inoculator.

Vaccination on tea-gardens. 15. Vaccination on tea-gardens by private and official agency is detailed in Table No. 5. There were 6,930 men, women, and children vaccinated by garden agency, of whom 5,294, equal to 76.36 per cent., proved successful. In addition, 4,117 primary vaccinations took place on tea-gardens by Government officers, of which 3,768, or 91.52 per cent., were successful. The total figures for 1886-87, therefore, are 11,050, 9,062, and 82.01, compared with 11,542, 9,239, and 80.04 last year. Except in Sylhet and Cachar, nothing to speak of is reported else- where. As explained last year, the table is quite defective, as no returns are enforced by law, and the figures given are only those which it pleases managers to give. Expenditure 16. In Table No. 6 is detailed, in a very complex and minute form, the cost of vacci- nation in Assam for 1886-87. The print is very small, and it is most trying to compare years gone by. The table ought to occupy two pages instead of one. Broadly speaking, the income side of the accounts stand at Rs. 15,131, made by budget grants of Rs. 6,644 from Provincial revenues, Rs. 7,616 from Local Boards, and Rs. 871 from municipalities; whereas the expenditure is less by nearly Rs. 3,000, being Rs. 6,247 of Provincial, Rs. 5,366 Local, and Rs. 521 Municipal. It is wrong to leave so large a balance unexpended. In some instances, there is a real saving by lower salaries than in previous years; but in most it is due to the full period of six months' employment not having been put in. In Goálpára there was a saving of Rs. 961 caused by licensed vaccinators being freely employed, whose remuneration was from the patients themselves. Government cost. 17. The Provincial budget grants for vaccination amounted to Rs. 6,644, and the actual expenditure was Rs. 6,247-14-7. The expendi- ture for last year was Rs. 7,349-8-9. The economy practised has been due to a more rigid supervision of the travelling allowances. A circular was issued by my orders restricting the maximum travelling allowance in any month to Rs. 15. The result has been a drop under this head from Rs. 2,546-13-9 to Rs. 1,652-13-8 without any diminution of efficiency. There is no doubt that vacci- nators in districts removed from supervision were taking advantage of unrestricted allowances. Local Boards 18. Provision had been made in the various Local budgets for a further expenditure of Rs. 8,487, of which only Rs. 871 was subscribed by the municipalities. An examination of Table 6 will show how feeble is the support given by them to vaccination; and it may be added that nowhere is its progress more dilatory and imperfect. It has already been stated the total expen- diture from local and municipal funds was Rs. 5,887, leaving an unexpended balance of Rs. 2,600. Civil Surgeons must, in future, be more careful to acquaint themselves with the budget grants. More vaccinators might have been employed, and more work done. Goálpára is particularly referred to in this respect, and the Khási Hills, Nowgong, Gáro Hills, and Sylhet have all suffered considerable balances to lapse. Summary. 19. Summing up the various totals, it is found that the total expenditure on vaccination for the season amounted to Rs. 12,135-11, compared with Rs. 12,978-2-3 in 1885-86. The total number of successful operations by paid agency increased from 83,277 to 94,202, and the average cost of each was reduced from 2 annas 5 ¾ pies to 2 annas 0¾ pies. If the total number of unpaid vaccinations be included, the total was increased from 108,992 to 117,766 and the cost of each reduced from 1 anna 10¾ pies to 1 anna 7¾ pies. Mortality from small-pox. 20. During the last four years the decrease in the mortality from small-pox has been very remarkable. In 1883, 6,162 deaths from this disease were registered, in 1884 4,781, in 1885 1,980, and in 1886 564. It is too soon to draw any reliable inferences in favour of general protection to the population; but all accounts agree that inoculation has been materially driven out of the field, and that vaccination could be widely substituted if the least show of authority were superadded.

The result of compulsory vaccination under Act V. of 1880 in the several areas placed under the Act in Assam is detailed above. Briefly stated, it appears among a population which num- bered in 1881 33,255, but which is probably much greater now, there were 1,487 children vaccinated, of whom 1,163, or 78.2 per cent., were successful. It would seem as though the Act is practically a dead letter. Except at Dibrugarh, there are no registers kept, nor any registrars appointed. In Gauháti there were only 4 prosecutions, and in Sylhet 27, of which 15 proceeded to conviction. As the Act has only been in force since 1882, it would appear that many children over age are included. At all events, the table shows that 7,696 children have been vaccinated in the compulsory areas since its introduction, while the registration of births in the same period shows 3,442 only GOÁLPÁRA. Staff. 22. This important district has been throughout the season under the superintendence of Surgeon E. Dobson, M.B., who has had under his orders 1 Inspector, 5 Hospital-Assistants, 1 provincial and 3 local vaccinators, 1 compounder and 11 licensed vaccinators, total 23. This is an increase of three individuals on the working staff of last year, but is more apparent than real, as all the Hospital-Assistants have been included, although their work was nominal. Results. 23. The results have not been commensurate with the records of past years. The number of primary operations has fallen from 15,285 to 11,081, and the proportion of successes from 93.62 per cent. to 91.57. Statement 1 of the district annual report shows the reduced figures are chiefly due to the inadequate work done by all classes except the licensees. Dr. Dobson does not fully explain how such general laziness has been allowed, except by a hint that the population open to vaccination is being reduced; but this is improbable, except the operators cling to their old beats, instead of searching new circles. Inspections 24. Inspection was, however, very good; 3,927 was the total number tested by the Civil Surgeon himself, of which 3,401 were licensees' opera- tions and 526 by paid operators. The general average of successes reported by Dr. Dobson was 90.91. In addition, 3,219 vaccinations were verified by the Inspector, of which 2,289 were licensees' work and 930 only by paid vacci- nators. The general average of successful operations in his case was 90.33. This is very good, and reads fairly honest. It should be the aim of every Superintendent to have two- thirds of the work done in his district inspected, and a general average of 90 per cent. successful will be accepted as commendable. No tea-gardens nor compulsory area 25. There are no tea-gardens. worked by immigrant protected labour, nor any vaccination outside Government agency; neither is there any compulsory area nor any prosecutions. Acceptance of the operation by the people. 26. The attitude of the people towards the vaccinators is variable. About the foot of the hills, and among the Gáros, there is often a real welcome given, accompanied with feasting and mummery; elsewhere the resistance is passive; and in many villages there exists a religious constraint which prevents the parents from allowing vaccination at all.

10 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. Prevalence of small-pox. 27. In respect of the danger to be apprehended from free inoculation or denying both it and vaccination, it is interesting to observe that 1886 has been a year of remarkable immunity from small-pox everywhere, and that in this respect the people have escaped indifferently. Inoculation has admittedly been on the wane the past three years, and I am inclined to attribute the decrease of small-pox to this cause, rather than to advanced protection by vaccination. The few tests taken at random by the Civil Surgeons prove incontestably that the population en masse have hardly a tithe protected by vaccination. On the other hand, the district sanitary and vaccination reports of the past three years are all agreed that the inoculators are fewer and rarer in their visits, and none of the Civil Surgeons seem to have had personal know- ledge of any epidemic outbreaks due to inoculation. It may be also that these men, who all come from Bengal Proper, have found their occupation gone, since so many of their class in Gauháti and Goálpára have been trained to use vaccine only, and are in opposition. Whatever the cause may be, the almost complete absence of small-pox from the registers of 1886 is very remarkable. In Goálpára, with a population of 446,232, there were only 60 deaths last year, compared with 436 in 1885, which itself was a year of remission. As the facts above noted for Goálpára are common to every district, it is unnecessary to repeat them. In my opinion the climate of Assam is inimical to small-pox, and that the disease could be stamped out as completely as in Ireland, if inoculation were prohibited by law, and vaccination widely substituted. Under existing freedom, the danger is of an overwhelming epidemic some day, when years have left the mass of the people neither inoculated nor vaccinated. Lymph supply. 28. Dr. Dobson reports that his supply of lymph was both ample and good. The English stock received from the Sanitary Commissioner of Assam established the general first supply, and subsequently the Sanitary Commissioner of Bengal was particularly generous in forwarding periodically tubes of human and bovine lymph. Expenditure. 29. It has already been explained (paragraph 16) that while an expenditure of Rs. 1,501 was budgetted for 1886-87 season's vaccination, the actual cost amounted to Rs. 540 only. For this latter sum there were only 2,298 successful vaccinations, and the average of each accordingly reaches the high price of 3 annas 9 pies. This is a serious increase on 2 annas 11 pies of 1885-86 and the 1 anna 8 pies of 1884-85. It means that the paid subordinates are not fulfilling their share of work. Dr. Dobson explains that he found it &quot; impossible &quot; to obtain the full number of paid vaccinators, which accounts for the large share of the budget grant which has lapsed, and he adds that many of his paid vaccinators would have preferred working as licensees. It would appear that both systems, so equally arranged, became antagonistic. Let Dr. Dobson develope his unpaid agency further, or at least divide his district equally between the paid and unpaid agency. There is no doubt but that they are now competing and obviating each other's success. The pay of the Inspector, too, should not be entirely charged against the district paid vaccinations. KÁMRÚP. Superintendence and staff. 30. Dr. J, Mullane, Civil Surgeon, Gauháti, is the Superintendent of Vaccination for Kámrúp, and has been in charge all the season. He has under his orders a working staff, comprising one Inspector, four Provincial and eight Local vaccinators, two Hospital-Assistants, and 18 licensed vaccinators. The numbers almost exactly correspond with those of 1885-86, except that the licensees have been reduced from 22 to 18. Results. 31. The work done, although not showing such a special record as last season, is, however, very meritorious. Dr. Mullane himself set the best example of the year in vaccinating 310 persons, while all the local paid vaccinators have a better average than before. The licensed vaccinators also are good. The total primary vaccinations came to 14,579, compared with 15,754 in 1885-86, and the successful cases to 13,261, or 90.95 per cent., compared with 13,781, or 87.47 per cent. There were 7,208, or nearly one-half, inspected, of which 2,150 were operations performed by licensed vaccinators, and it is stated that the average of successes by these men reached 92.88, compared with 91.52 per cent. of the paid and instructed agents. I observe that Dr. Mullane has not himself inspected any of these unpaid agents' vaccination, and until he has himself verified the quality and quantity of the work credited to them, a very considerable doubt will remain both as to the accuracy of the former and the protection of the latter.
REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. 11 Lymph source. 32. The original supply of lymph was obtained from England through the Sanitary Commissioner of Assam, and was found good in every respect. Nearly 100 ivory points were charged from the first cases developed in Gauháti, and thereafter the men took their departure to mapped and named areas, armed with a magistrate's parwana of protection. Attitude of the people. 33. Like many others in Assam, Dr. Mullane finds that opposition is frequently due rather to the individual performer than to the rite itself. This may be readily admitted. The villagers are, in fact, too ignorant to know any difference in the latter: but an operator who has lived among them for years, and can flatter or frighten as is required, exercises naturally a very material influence. It is in this respect the ex-inoculators have succeeded for many years in carrying on more than half the vaccination of the district at no expense to Government at all. Small-pox. 34. As elsewhere, small-pox was quite phenomenally rare in Kámrúp. The mor- tality for 1886 reached the insignificant figure of 10 in 100,000. Inoculation is still widely practised, but no epidemic due to that source was observed. The amount of protection enjoyed by the inhabitants was estimated roughly by an examination of 293 prisoners. Among these, 176 had been inoculated, 59 vaccinated, 29 had gone through small-pox, and 29 were unprotected. Expenditure. 35. There remains only to give a brief note of the cost of vaccination in Kámrúp. Rs. 1,454 were originally sanctioned for the season, and only Rs. 1,189-12-3 was spent. I observe from a correspondence that the Local Board have refused to grant any travelling allowance to the Inspector, on the plea that he is paid all the year round. This is very bad economy. The Inspector is an able man, and, unless he gets travelling allowance, it is pretty certain he will not cover the ground as it is necessary he should do. Besides, it is not as though he were idle in the hot weather. He is always at the Civil Surgeon's orders for epidemic out- breaks. His travelling allowance, up to Rs. 15 a month, should certainly be allowed, subject to the usual vouchers. The average price of each successful operation was 2 annas 11 pies. NOWGONG. Superintendence and staff. 36. The annual report is prepared by Mr. McNaught, Civil Medical Officer and Superintendent of Vaccination, all through the season. It is covered by an intelligent review by Mr. Knox Wight, Deputy-Commissioner, whose interest in and support of sanitary progress is always marked. Under Mr. McNaught there were one Inspector, 3 provincial and 8 local vaccinators, and two Hospital-Assistants. Results. 37. The total number of primary operations performed was 10,742, compared with 6,819 in the previous season. This considerable increase is attributed to the help and support of the civil authorities, which succeeded in removing the prejudices of particular classes hitherto in opposition, and also to greater diligence and success on the part of the vaccinators, and to more careful and frequent supervision. Classes vaccinated. 38. A table is given, showing the exact number of each sect or class in Nowgong who were vaccinated, viz., 13 Christians, 733 Muhammadans, 5,438 Hindus, 1,106 Domes, 2,248 Mikirs, 465 Kacharis, 705 Lalungs, 40 Gáros, not specified 27, total 10,775. Inspections. 39. Out of the total number.vaccinated, 10,032, or 93.40 per cent., were successful as primary; and 33 secondary operations were also perfomed, with 31 succsses, or 93.93 per cent. 8,109 of the vaccinations were also verified, viz., 2,568 by the Civil Medical Officer and 5,541 by the Inspector. This is equal to 75.25 per cent., and is by far the largest proportion hitherto recorded. There seems to be some mistake in the record of successes. In Statement II. it is shown that, of the whole number vaccinated, viz., 10,742, 10,032, or 93.40 per cent., were success- ful; whereas from Statement III. it appears that no less than 1,016 out of 8,109 were found unsuccessful. This makes a serious reduction to 87.47 per cent. on the inspected and more reliable cases. Tea-gardens. 40. On the tea-gardens of this important district, with a population of 12,681, vaccina- tion is not looked after as it ought to be. Only 311 cases were performed, with 226 successful, or 72 per cent. On 25 gardens it was reported that no vaccination was practised; others state that 95 to 100 per cent. are already protected. From four gardens no answers were received. Of course, this is
12 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. all wrong. Vaccination ought to be compulsory on every garden, and, unless managers see that medical officers do their duty in this respect, a day will come when the neglect of precautions will be regretted. Lymph supply. 41. The English lymph received from the Sanitary Commissioner of Assam at the commencement of the season was very good, and materially contributed to establish reliable vaccination. Mr. McNaught suggests that it would be a material benefit if a second supply were available about Christmas; but the English supply is very expensive. Besides this, the Sanitary Commissioner of Bengal was good enough to furnish periodical supplies. Bovine lymph was a failure. Decrease of small-pox. 42. The statistics of mortality from small-pox in Nowgong are very favourable. In 1881 there were 549 deaths among a population of 310,579; in 1882, 176; 1883, 81; 1884, 51; 1885; 15; 1886, 11. But how little the people are adequately protected is shown by Mr. McNaught's examination of patients at the dispensary; among 1,396, it was found 501 had been inoculated, 798 had passed through small-pox, 65 only had been vaccinated, and 32 were unprotected. As during the last ten years, 32,195 persons have been vaccinated in Nowgong, it is not to be expected that much impression can have been made on the general population; but after ten years more of active increase, such statistics ought to be greatly modified. Inoculation. 43. As indicated by the dispensary examination, inoculation was formerly very openly and commonly practised. It is still carried on away from stations. Mr. McNaught found a Bengali had in- oculated 13 persons in a village before he was reported. Of these, 5 passed through small-pox successfully, 7 failed, 1 girl died; but no epidemic followed. Expenditure. 44. Of Rs. 1,244, which formed the sanctioned grant of the year in Nowgong, Rs. 941-10-1 only appears to have been expended. The cost of each successful operation, therefore, was reduced to a minimum of one anna six pies only, and I am strongly of opinion it would be judicious on the part of the Local Board to grant a gratuity of one month's pay to the subordinates, in consideration of the excellent results shown in Nowgong since 1884-85. Special remarks. 45. Mr. Knox-Wight's covering letter to the annual report merits special notice. He has endeavoured, to the utmost of his power, and with considerable success, to avert opposition on the part both of Muhammadans and Hindus. By friendly discussion and arguments he has obtained many concessions. DARRANG. Superintendence and staff. 46. Dr. R. N. Campbell, Civil Surgeon of Tezpur, superintended all the vaccination of this district throughout the season. He had under him a working staff, increased from 13 to 17, and which comprised, besides himself, one Inspector, four Government and eight Local Fund vaccinators, two Hospital-Assistants, one compounder and one licensed vaccinator. Results 47. Their combined efforts succeeded in producing an aggregate of 11,417 opera- tions, of which 10,105, or 88.50 per cent., were successful. Each class worked zealously to achieve this satisfactory highest record. The Inspector alone does not take part in actual vaccination; he was too much engaged in moving from place to place. General observations. 48. Dr. Campbell's annual report is very concise, and may be reviewed in a single paragraph. The English lymph received through the Sanitary Commissioner, of Assam proved very efficient. Vacci- nation was started early, and the men usually worked in pairs for each sub-division and thána. There was no material opposition; inoculation is no longer practised; there was little or no small-pox anywhere; there is no compulsory area; vaccination on tea-gardens is left almost entirely to Government operators, the number of cases having totalled 989, of which 875, or 88.47 per cent., were successful. Inspections. 49. Dr. Campbell has taken particular pains to make his inspection thorough. In addition to 629 verified by himself, the Inspector tested 5,208, including all those performed by the licensee The great advantage of having these inspections is instanced here, for the proportionate successes among the tested cases was found to be 80.18 only, which included a phenomenal 99.38 per cent. of the licensed vaccinator. It is, however, explained that the latter attained his entire success by not counting his failures, but repeating the operation.
REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. 13 Expenditure. 50. The budget grant for Darrang amounted to Rs. 1,484, and the actual expendi- ture to Rs. 1,468-6. This is as it should be. No difficulty was found in procuring operators; their training was carefully supervised by the Civil Surgeon himself; the travelling allowances are most reasonable. The average cost of each successful paid operation was 2 annas and 81/3 pies; while, inclusive of the unpaid vaccinations performed by the licensee, compounder, Hospital-Assistants, and Civil Surgeon, the average cost was 2 annas 3 pies only. SIBSÁGAR. Superintendence and staff. 51. Assistant-Surgeon A. P. Ghosh, Officiating Civil Medical Officer, was superin- tendent of vaccine operations in Sibságar during the season. He had under his orders one Inspector, three Government, three municipal, and 15 Local Fund vaccinators; besides six Hospital-Assistants. This is an increase of three over the previous strength. Results. 52. The results are exceedingly satisfactory. Last season Mr. Atkins was con- sidered to have done uncommonly well in raising the aggregate of vaccinations from 4,971 to 12,994; but Mr. Ghosh has succeeded in surpassing the latter record, with a total of 16,450 operations, out of which 15,300, or 93.04 per cent., are said to have been successful. Three Government or provincial vaccinators head the list with an average of 876; 15 Local Fund vaccinators follow with an average of 744; while the average of the whole 29 staff is 567. These results will be found equal if not superior, to any other. Inspections. 53. Of the quality of the work so performed, Mr. A. P. Ghosh also reports very favourably. The lymph first obtained through the Sanitary Commissioner of Assam was of excellent quality and suc- cessful in every case. During the season 4,843 cases were inspected. This is hardly a sufficient proportion. The Inspector is credited with only 1,873 of these, which must be materially increased next season. General remarks. 54. Local influence appears to have had much to do with the success. These vaccinators, who are residents and acquainted with the feelings and prejudices of the villagers, are always most welcome. Mr. Ghosh relies much on the tact, kindness, conciliation, and patience of the vaccinators, but more especially on the quality of the virus, and its distinctive protective value, as opposed to the danger of inoculation. The three great Gosains from the Majhuli visited Sibságar on the occasion of the Jubilee festival, and were spoken to on the subject of their sustained refusal to allow vaccination among their followers. Mr. Anderson enters a marginal note that he fears &quot;their prejudices are not yet entirely overcome.&quot; Small-pox. 55. The year was especially favourable here, as elsewhere, in the diminished mor- tality from small-pox. A recorded mortality of 28 only in an area containing 270,274 of population in 1881 is the lowest on record. Neither was inoculation prevailing. There is no compulsory area. It is calculated from the births that the annual number of children available for vaccination in Sibságar is a little over 8,000, and that 5,019 of them were successfully vaccinated in 1886-87. No accurate information was procurable as to the vaccination performed on tea-gardens. Expenditure. 56. The budget grant for this district amounted to Rs. 1,510, and the entire expenditure to Rs. 1,322-2-6. The average cost of each successful case was 1 anna 3 pies only. I have much pleasure in copying the following note by Mr. J. D. Anderson, Deputy-Commissioner, on the report:14 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. Results. 58. Vaccination has not advanced on the figures of 1885-86. The total number of primary operations has decreased from 8,005 to 6,210. Of the latter figure, 5,183, or 83.46 per cent., were reported successful. As, however, only about one in eleven was verified, such successes are proble- matical. North Lakhimpur. 59. Included in the return for Dibrugarh is the vaccination at the sub-divisional head-quarters of North Lakhimpur. Here Dr. Cran, who has medical charge, superintends, and has three vaccinators under him. This is not sufficient. There ought to be four at least at North Lakhimpur, and the staff at Dibrugarh might be materially increased. The number of successful vaccinations should not be less than 10,000. General remarks. 60. Dr. Whitwell is alone in reporting that the English lymph was unsuccessful, except in one instance. All the other reports are uniformly good. The town of Dibrugarh is a compulsory area; but, as noted elsewhere, the working of the Act is not very vigorous. Only 252 successful operations were performed, and &quot;no one was punished for resisting.&quot; Expenditure. 61. Rs. 1,084 was the total budget grant, and Rs. 1,011-7-6 the actual expenditure. Of this sum, Rs. 252 was admitted as travelling allowance. In the adjoining district of Sibságar the vaccinators get no travelling allowance, and I cannot help thinking it is quite unnecessary. The money so saved could be put to much better purpose in paying an Inspector. The best system is to have local, resident, well-known vaccinators, thoroughly protecting each a given area, and travelling Inspectors, who see that the work is being properly done and reported to the Civil Surgeon, The average cost of each successful vaccination has always been high in Lakhimpur. In 1886-87 it was 3 annas 4 pies, a very remarkable contrast to the propor- tion in Sibságar. NÁGA HILLS. Summary. 62. Vaccination in the Nága Hills, with Kohima as its head-quarters, has not made very great progress since it was first attempted in 1881. During the past season the Provincial vaccinator has im- proved on his record of last year, and obtained 410 patients, in whom 343, or 83.66 per cent., proved successful. The Hospital-Assistant added 85 and 63 successful, and the dresser at Wokha obtained 648 with 561, or 86.57, per cent., successful. But it does not seem clear how any work is done at all, for Dr. Basu, the Officiating Civil Medical Officer, states that he could not get any one to undergo it except with the aid of a guard and &quot;authority.&quot; The dresser was stationed at Wokha, and the vaccinator at Lozema, and both worked to the end of the season. Rs. 330 was the total of the sanctioned grant, and Rs. 307 was expended. The average cost of each successful operation by the vaccinator was 14 annas 4 pies. KHÁSI AND JAINTIA HILLS. Superintendence and staff. 63. There is practically no superintendence of vaccination, as the Civil Surgeon of Shillong never visits the district, and the village work is not inspected. There are two provincial and one municipal vaccinator, and assistance is also given by the Dispensary Hospital-Assistant at Shillong. Summary of results. 64. The two vaccinators worked well, having an average of 1,185 operations each, with 87.55 per cent. of successes. The municipal vaccinator succeeded 332 times, or 89 per cent. of his 373 cases Altogether, 3,209 cases were operated, viz., 3,014 primary, with 2,636, or 87.45 successful. and 195 re-vaccinations, of which 130, or 66.66 per cent., were successful. There is a distinct falling off in numbers here, compared with the seasons both 1884-85 and 1885-86, but Dr. Moran explains that the staff was not fully employed, and one vaccinator turned out irregular work. Feeling of the people. 65. Very little is really known about the vaccination in these hills; information is entirely secondhand. It is said that most of the work is done in the eastern side, and that many villages are entirely protected. I am inclined to doubt it. Inoculation is distinctly practised, and last year a Seim reported that the public peace would be endangered if it was prohibited. The mortality from small-pox was considerable, in comparison with other districts; 61 deaths having taken place, chiefly in the three groups of villages round Nongkhlow, Mariau, and Soheeang, but even at the time the people refused to accept vaccination.
REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. 15 Lymph supply 66. Dr. Moran reports that the English lymph in tubes supplied through the Sanitary Commissioner of Assam was successful, and of excellent quality. Expenditure. 67. The cost of vaccination in these hills has always been very high, owing to the extraordinary scale of travelling allowances claimed by the staff. Last year they drew Rs. 879 under this head, and the average cost of each successful case was 6 annas 1½ pies each. A rule was accordingly made that not more than Rs. 15 monthly would in future be sanctioned. The total budget grant for the year was Rs. 834, and the actual expenditure Rs. 734-14-3. The travelling allowances were reduced to Rs. 324-10-8, and the average cost of each successful vaccination to 4 annas 42/3 pies. Dr. Moran will be good enough to make his subordinates understand that this sum is still considered extravagant; and that it is expected they will so far extend their operations that the average cost shall not exceed 3 annas. GÁRO HILLS. Superintendence and working staff 68. Dr. P. M. Gupta, Civil Medical Officer of Tura, was Superintendent of Vacci- nation in this district, and had under his orders 6 provincial vaccinators and one Hospital-Assistant. Supply of lymph. 69. He was supplied early in the season with 10 tubes of English lymph through the Sanitary Commissioner of Assam, and found them all good and successful. He was also assisted by a few tubes from Dacca and Darjiling. Results. 70. Dr. Gupta's assistants worked very well and thoroughly, although there is some doubt on the reliability of their figures, seeing so little of their work is ever inspected. His six operators had an average of 1,369 cases each, which is by far the highest on record; followed by 98.38 per cent. successful cases. I recommend some careful checks on the registers, but the men are often far distant from head-quarters, and Dr. Gupta complains that his duties as treasury officer prevent his adequately supervising these subordinates. Only 1,184 of the operations were inspected; but it is significant, both here and elsewhere, that the verified successes were 86.06 per cent. only. Attitude of the Gáros and prevalence of small-pox. 71. Among the Gáros there is little real opposition to vaccination. For many years it has been accepted willingly, and inoculation is nowhere favoured. Many times parents have come to Dr. Gupta, and begged his personal visit to their village, to assure them their children were fully protected. There was no outbreak of small-pox reported. Expenditure. 72. The budget grant was Rs. 1,074, of which Rs. 839-13-2 only appears to have been expended, viz., Rs. 477-0-2 in salaries and Rs. 362-13 in travelling allowances. The total expenditure, compared with results, is not the least satisfactory feature of the report, and shows the average cost of each successful vaccination to have fallen from 1 anna 9¾ pies in 1885-86 to 1 anna 7¾ pies in 1886-87. SYLHET. Superintendence and staff. 73. Dr. Macnamara, Civil Surgeon, has been Superintendent of Vaccination in this populous and extensive district all through the season. He had under his orders two Inspectors, 10 provincial, 2 municipal, and 22 Local Board vaccinators, beside eight Hospital-Assistants and four compounders. The staff of all classes engaged numbered, therefore, 48, being an addition of two to the number engaged last season. Results 74. Briefly stated, the number of vaccinators having increased from 46 to 48, the operations have also risen from 25,015 in 1885-86 to 28,083 in 1886-87. Of this last figure, 27,951 were primary, with a professed average of 95.56 successful and 132 re-vaccinations, with 95.45 successful. The average number of vaccinations for each operator is 585 only, the Hospital- Assistant and municipal vaccinators having very insignificant totals. On the other hand, ten Provincial vaccinators had an excellent average of 1,177, and a few of the Local Fund men also did good work. Inspections. 75. On the important subject of inspection I regret not to find any satisfactory explanation to the objections raised in last year's report. Statement III gives a total of 18,487 as having been verified, divided 1,345 to the Civil Surgeon, 15,070 to the Inspectors, and 2,072 among Hospital-Assistants. It is stated that 8,000 were tested in the Sunámganj sub-division,
16 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. whereas the return accounts for 1,899 vaccinations only in Snnámganj. Such as they are, however, the general average of successes has been given above; but they are in my opinion too favourable. Vaccination on tea-gardens by private agency. 76. There was an average resident coolie population of 54,397 in Sylhet during 1886. How many of them are unprotected cannot be stated; but among them 460 men, 402 women, and 3,046 children were vaccinated by private agency during the season. Of this total (3,908), 2,676, or 68.47 per cent., only proved successful. This is in startling contrast to the professions of the public vaccinators; and Dr. Macnamara, while supporting his own figures, does rot explain the different results attained by competent operators elsewhere in the district. Inoculation and small-pox. 77. Most of the Sylhet villagers are ignorant of any distinction between inoculation and vaccination; the former is now not practised commonly; but its use seems to be dying out; no outbreak of small-pox was traced to this cause. The mortality from small-pox in Sylhet has greatly decreased of late years. In 1883 the total was 2,584; in 1884, 2,646; in 1885, 683; and in 1886 only 98. Lymph supply. 78. Twenty tubes of English lymph were early obtained from the Sanitary Commis- sioner of Assam; half of these produced vesicles, and the quality was reported to be good. As the English supply is obtained solely to commence the season with the best possible lymph, the Civil Surgeon should himself supervise their initial use, and not leave its quality to be reported on by his subordinates. At regular intervals during the season, further supplies were obtained through the Sanitary Commissioners and Superintendents of Bengal, Dacca, Almorah, and Darjiling. Generally speaking, the quality was good, though in many instances bovine lymph was a failure. Expenditure. 79. The budget allotment for the year amounted to Rs. 3,331. Provincial revenues contributed Rs. 1,050, Local Funds Rs. 1,314-14-11, and municipalities Rs. 53-14 in salaries and Rs. 234 travelling allowances, towards the total expenditure of Rs. 2,652-13-2. It will be seen that no less a sum than Rs. 678-2-10 lapsed unexpended. As 26,330 of the vaccinations are claimed to have been successful, the average cost of each is the very small proportion of 1 anna 7 1/3 pies. Compulsory area. 80. The town of Sylhet within municipal limits is a compulsory area under Act V. of 1880. The population was 14,407 in 1881. During the past season 350 vaccinations took place. 27 persons were tried before an Honorary Magistrate under the Act, of whom 15 were convicted. There is no competent registrar. An attempt was made to oblige Dr. Macnamara to be registrar, and to prosecute under the Act, to which the Civil Surgeon made a strong objection, and is supported by the Deputy-Commissioner. Failing in this, the munici- pality compelled the Hospital-Assistant of Rainagar Dispensary to undertake registration and prosecutions, &quot; a duty which he cannot possibly perform.&quot; Conclusion. 81. Although I cannot accept Dr. Macnamara's figures as accurate, I cannot help expressing my sense of his zeal in vaccination, and his capable administration of the large number of subordinates. He has the chief merit of raising the number of vaccinations from 1,945 in 1881-82 to 27,951 in 1886-87. CACHAR. Superintendence and staff. 82. Dr. T. d'O. Patridge, Civil Surgeon, has been Superintendent throughout the season, and has had under his orders one Inspector, three Provincial, one municipal, and seven Local Fund vaccinators, besides three Hospital-Assistants and two compounders. Results. 83. The total number of persons vaccinated amounted to 10,646, of which 10,525 were primary and 121 secondary. The percentage of success- ful cases was 91.06 in the former and 76.86 in the latter. The Government and Local Fund vaccinators each had an average of nearly 950, which is very good; while the municipal vaccinators did fairly good work with 572. Inspections. 84. The numbers verified on inspection were 1,293 by the Civil Surgeon and 3,644 by the Inspector, total 4,937; and the successful proportion among them was found something greater than the general average; though it is not quite clear how such a difference can occur as 82.38 in Lakhim- pur and 94 per cent. in Hailákándi.
REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. 17 General summary. 85. Besides Government vaccination, 2,234 (nearly all children) tea-garden labourers were vaccinated by private agency, the succesful cases being 1,933, or 86.49 per cent. There is no compulsory area and little or no assistance obtained from civil authority. Inoculation is very much practised, but there was no genuine record of any mortality or epidemic outbreak. There were only two deaths from small-pox registered in the whole of Cachar in 1886. The usual supply of lymph was obtained from the Sanitary Commissioners of Assam and Bengal, and was good, especially the English tubes. General protection against small-pox. 86. Dr. Partridge was at some pains to examine different classes of the people who came under his care to ascertain the extent of protec- tion against small-pox, and has given the results in the subjoined table:18 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. 7 pies to 2 annas 5¾ pies. In 1886-87, 94,202 paid successful vaccinations cost Rs. 12,135-11 only, and the average cost shows the material reduction from 2 annas 5¾ pies to 2 annas 0¾ pies. Continued decrease of inoculation and small-pox. 91. All accounts agree in stating that the practice of inoculation is yearly becom- ing more infrequent. The people consider it is still gifted with more entire protection than vaccination, but a few more years of careful and systematic supervision will satisfy them that good vaccination has all the advantages without the dangerous risks of inoculation. Many of the Civil Surgeons are of opinion that in districts, as distinguished from towns, compulsory vacci- nation would be practicable. There has been unfortunately no progress made in remov- ing the prejudices of the Gosains and their prohibitive orders. It is apparently due solely to personal interest as proper to maintain alike their privileges and authority. Reduced travelling allowances. 92. The excessive travelling allowances, which had hitherto been unchecked, and which led to unreasonable claims, have been modified in accord- ance with the views expressed in last season's report (para- graph 24). By Circular letter No. 5-498 S.REPORT ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM. 19 Vaccination under the Rev. Dr. Griffiths at Mauphlang 95. For more than three years a vaccinator has been specially sanctioned for the mission station of Mauphlang, under the supervision of the Rev. G. Griffith, M.D., who was in medical charge. I regret to report that it has been found necessary to withdraw the sanction, owing to the inadequate results. There ought to be an excellent field in that neighbourhood, and, with work open to him at least ten months in the year, 800 operations should have been reported. But, as a fact, the number reported in 1886 was only 330. Review of last season's report by the Government of India. 96. The Government of India review of the Assam Vaccination Report was received in this office on the 30th October 1886. The difficulty of ascertaining the precise nature and extent of vaccination on tea-gardens is mentioned, owing to all such information being dependant on the personal interest taken in it by managers. Some progress in this respect might be made if Government would authorise the free issue of a blank register and annual return to each manager or medical officer. Statement IV. in the present annual return is drawn up in accordance with the form prescribed by Home Department Resolution No. 86, dated 9th May 1877. Medical officers' services acknowledged. 97. The Superintendents of Vaccination in charge of districts who have been especially successful during the season 1886-87 have been Dr. R.Neil Campbell in Darrang, Dr. J. Mullane in Gauháti, and Dr. J. Macnamara in Sylhet. In Nowgong Mr. J. McNaught and in Sibságar Assistant- Surgeon A. P. Ghosh have made great advances, and have been particularly active and careful in their administration. Dr. P. M. Gupta also deserves a word of praise for keeping up a large average of operations under many special difficulties natural to that region. A.

Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner of Assam in the General Depart- ment, No. 5,447, dated Shillong, the 14th September 1887. READ( 2 ) Work done by each class of operators. 4. Of the 121,900 operations only 571 were re-vaccinations. The number of operators being 214, this gives an average of 569 apiece, against 553 in 1885-86; but, as before stated, only 155 of the staff were persons whose whole time was given to vaccination. The following table shows the number done by each class in detail:(3) General remarks. 9. The year was remarkably free from small-pox, from which disease only 564 deaths were recorded in 1886. Dr. Eteson states that in his opinion the climate of Assam is inimical to this disease, and that it would be possible, by prohibiting inoculation by law and giving a free course to vaccina- tion, altogether to stamp it out of the Province. Several Civil Surgeons have recorded statistics of the proportion of the people coming under their observation who were found to be inoculated, protected by having had small-pox, and vaccinated. At Nowgong Dr. McNaught found, among 1,396 patients at the dispensary, 501 who had been inoculated, 798 who had had small-pox, and only 65 who had been vaccinated. At Silchar Dr. Partridge found, out of 971 persons, chiefly schoolboys, 487 who had been inoculated, 242 who had been vaccinated, 130 who had had small-pox, and 112 who were unprotected. These observations should be continued. The large proportion at Nowgong who had had small- pox hardly bears out Dr. Eteson's theory that the climate of the Province is hostile to the disease. The extensive use of inoculation proved by these statistics at least shows that the people recognise small-pox as a danger which requires to be combated. The ages of the persons examined at Nowgong are not stated; the extensive spread of vaccination, as shown by Statement IV. appended to the report, is a matter of very recent date, and its effects can hardly yet be visible among adults. Dr. Eteson gives reasons for thinking that inoculation is really giving way in Assam before vaccination, and the Chief Com- missioner hopes that this may be the case. The religious objections, however, to vaccination entertained by some of the Gosains of Upper Assam, and by the Mahapurushiya sect who are numerous in Kámrúp, are still far from being removed.

Modification of present report. 1. The orders of the Government of India, quoted in the covering letter, direct that reports on Vaccination shall be full triennially, the intermediate years being confined to statistical returns, with brief commentaries. No Provincial subsidiary orders have been received directing the precise statistics to be published annually, and therefore the modification adopted for the present season has been to present Provincial tables alone in the body of the report with explanatory notes, followed by the statements required by the Government of India. Anticipation of material check to progress. 2. I may be allowed to express here my anticipation that the Assam Report on Vacci- nation, if confined annually to the Government of India statements only, would be prejudicial to the progress and interest taken in the subject. Our vaccination department has lately taken vigorous growth, development and results, and will receive a material check by too heavy pruning in its immature stage. Lymph supply. 3. There has been no change introduced during the year in the sources of lymph. 200 tubes from England were received on the 10th September 1887, and distributed as before. It seems to have varied very much in quality, as indeed should be expected; but in several instances the original tubes sufficed, not only for early stock, but even to maintain the supply throughout the entire season. Periodical supplies were also received from Calcutta, Darjeeling, Almorah, and Dacca, and helped the operators largely. Bovine lymph has proved a failure again and again. TABLE 1.

It is satisfactory to find a decided improvement in the figures recorded. Last season the verified vaccination of the Province was 58,586, or 48 per cent. of all the operations. In 1887-88, the inspections have totalled 69,237, or 52 per cent. A fair share of this important duty has been taken by Civil Surgeons. I have found it necessary to forbid Hospital-Assistants inspecting district vaccination The duty was only nominally performed, and was incompatible with their dispensary duty. In future they are to be inspectors for town limits only. The last column of the return gives the percentage of successful operations deduced from inspected cases only, and is in more reasonable proportion to the actual surrounding conditions, rather than to fanciful theories.

The vaccination on tea-gardens is a sanitary measure required by the rules framed under Act I. of 1882; but there is no rule requir- ing managers to submit a report of what vaccination has been done. In an Appendix will be found a copy of a circular recently issued to each district, pointing out the relative duties in this respect. The statistics show that vaccina- tion is being generally neglected, through the opinion that has spread that the duty rests primarily with Government operators, and possibly from the continued immunity from epidemic small-pox enjoyed for some years. Table No 6 omitted. 9. In previous Annual Reports there has followed in this place a complex and laboriously detailed table showing the cost of the depart- ment for the whole season. In accordance with the economy recommended, this has now been omitted. All necessary information under this heading will be found in General Statement No. II., which will be explained later on.

Licensed vaccinators, formerly termed ex-inoculators, are chiefly employed in Goálpára and Kámrúp. The operations attributed to them have increased from 15,838 last season to 19,807 in this; and the number inspected has also increased from 8,164, or 51 per cent., to 11,627, or 58 per cent. The proportion of successful cases among those inspected has increased from 91.27 per cent. to 92.12 per cent. The work intrusted to these men is at last placed on a thoroughly satisfactory footing in Goálpára. They are, in fact, under precisely the same system as the Government vaccinators, and, indeed, are for the most part private practitioners who extend the benefit of vaccination at no cost to Government. I should be glad to see Dr. Dobson's excellent arrangements copied elsewhere, more especially in the populous and thriving district of Sylhet. With local energy and emulation, the vaccination in South Sylhet could easily be doubled by licensees drawing fees from those operated on, subject to strict inspection and obtaining always their lymph stock through the Civil Surgeon. General tables. 12. Besides the preceding district tables, the Annual Vaccination Statements Nos. I. to III. of the Province are submitted, drawn in accordance with the Government of India requisition contained in Home Department Sanitary Resolution No. 86, dated Simla, the 9th May 1877. Statement No. I. 13. In Statement No. I., the particulars of vaccination are given for each district; the classes of operators; the population both in gross and average per square mile; the total operations of the season in each district; the average number performed by each class ; the successful primary and secondary vaccination, with the proportion per thousand of population ; the average quinquennial preceding vaccinations; and the average mortality from small-pox during the same period. Statement No. I. continued. 14. It is difficult to compress within a single illustrative paragraph all the informa- tion herein detailed. The average annual mortality from small-pox, .72 per thousand, occupies a medium position, being higher than Bengal, Punjab, Berar, Lower Burma, and Bombay; and lower than the North-Western Provinces,. the Madras Presidency, and Coorg. The proportion of
( 5 ) the population protected for all India is 28.74 per mille, compared with 24.01 for Assam. The Assam Valley districts are distinctly in advance of the Surma Valley, both in the proportion of the people protected and in the industry of the vaccinators. For the first time, it is shown how thoroughly backward and unprotected Sylhet is; the proportion of successful vaccinations being only 13 per thousand, compared with 35 in Cachar, and an average of 31 in the six Assam Valley districts. If vaccination were as forward in Sylhet as it is in Darrang, or even in Lakhimpur, the number of operations in the season should be 75,000, instead of 25,000. There is likewise a great contrast between 650 vaccinations performed by each Local Fund vaccinator in Sylhet and 1,023 credited to each of that class in Cachar. Dr. Macnamara should organise licensed vaccinators on the principle of payment by private fees, as is being so successfully worked in Goálpára by Dr. Dobson. Abstract Statement No. I. 15. The complicated statistics of Statement I. are reformed as an abstract in a smaller table, No. 1A., to follow. This is chiefly useful, as showing the success which has attended each class of operators. The percentage of primary successful vaccination varies from 83.20 per cent. of Hospital-Assistants to 97.44 of the Native Inspectors; while the 91.72 per cent. for all is fairly representative and adequate. The figure for India generally in 1886 was 94.43. Statement No. II. 16. In General Statement No. II. the cost of the department is given in a much more readable and concise form than in the table hitherto presented in the body of the report, and now expunged. The total cost of the department was only Rs. 13,356-14-5, towards which provincial funds contributed Rs. 6,164 11-6, Local Funds Rs. 6,537-0-5, and Municipalities Rs. 655-2-6. The average cost of each successful operation varied from As. 15-6 in Goálpára to As. 1-7½ in Sibságar. But these sums cover the paid operations only, and under them Goálpára is unfairly represented. Taking all the vaccinations into account, the average cost is reduced to 1 anna 10 pies for each successful case, and this is the correct view, as all the unpaid operations are under inspection and administration by paid officers. The vaccination at Manipur was initiative, and the cost unproportional. Next season a paid vaccinator will be at work. Statement No. III. 17. This return, which is required by the Government of India in the orders quoted in paragraph 12, is not applicable to Assam. Hospital-Assist- ants are required to assist in vaccination within the ordinary limits of their medical duties, but they have no special dispensary attendance for that purpose. Statement No. IV. 18. In General Statement No. IV. the progress of vaccination in Assam for the past ten years is figured. While the total at foot exhibits a fair improvement, the details afford some grounds for criticism. Notwithstanding the large increase to the immigrant population of all ages and both sexes, vaccination is not being cared for as it should be. Managers have apparently drifted into the notion that it may be left to Government agency, and the district reports by medical officers make mention of difficulties thrown in the way even when assistance by Government agency has been proffered. The truth I suspect to be that the rules have not been enforced, and so neglect has spread. A circular on the subject has been issued, and will, it is hoped, remind managers of their duty. It is possible, however, that the figures do not represent the vaccination really performed, as no return is required by law, and the information is entirely voluntary. The vaccinations performed by Provincial operators may be said to have made no advance, at all since 1883-84, the same of Municipal operators since 1884-85, while the Local Funds operators have not advanced, compared with the increase to their number in 1885-86. The only satisfactory figures in the table are those of licensed vaccinators, who give 19,807 operations, with 92.71 per cent. of successes, at practically no cost at all. Subject to thorough inspection, as is being given in Goálpára, it is highly desirable that a beginning on the same principles of payment by private fees should be authorised in each district. It seems strange that Dr. Dobson in Goálpára cannot get vaccinators to accept Government employment, while Sylhet and Cachar are wholly reliant on paid agency. A beginning should be made. Vaccination in Manipur. 19. Last season vaccination was begun in Manipur. It has long been supposed that the rigid caste prejudices of the people presented an insuperable bar to any protection except through Brahmin inoculators. Colonel J. Johnstone, when Political Agent, proposed bovine lymph only, C
( 6 ) and had such encouragement that the Hospital-Assistant of the dispensary was sent to attend the school in Calcutta, and he returned with instruction and the appliances for buffaloes as the vaccinifers. But no success has followed the use of such lymph in Assam; and it ended by ordinary lymph being obtained in tubes from Calcutta and Dacca. A fair amount of success has attended the introduction. Several Nága children were shown to me, and the parents were rather proud of the distinction. A vaccinator has been sanctioned for next season, and a share of English lymph will also be sent to Manipur. Hospital-Assistant Lutchman Prasad deserves credit for his energy. TABLE No. 7. District.

It closes (paragraph 5) with a suggestion that the religious prejudices of certain sections of the community in Kámrúp and Upper Assam might possibly be removed if the use of buffaloes as vaccinifers could be brought into practice. The opinion of the department, after enquiry, was not in favour of such a change. In this office No. 92S., dated Shillong, the 20th February 1888, I reported that no advantage corresponding to the additional expense and uncertainty was likely to result. The objection is less to the source of the lymph originally, than to the propagation through children of every caste. I also pointed out that the effort to introduce vaccination into Manipur by buffaloes has entirely failed, whereas the present year has seen human lymph accepted for the first time. But, perhaps, the strongest objection is that in Assam bovine lymph in any form loses its vitality very rapidly; so that Civil Surgeons' reports almost invariably mention that supplies of it received periodically from the Bengal depôts, are of no use at all. It would never do to substitute inefficient operations. A. ETESON, M.D., Deputy-Surgeon-General, and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam.

( 13 ) A.( 14 ) COMPARATIVE STATEMENT No. IV.( 15 ) APPENDIX A. Vaccination in Tea-Gardens. Dr. * * * has the medical charge of several tea-gardens in this district, and I have received a letter from him, under date the 7th May, explaining why so little vaccination has been performed in his gardens during the past season. He states that the Civil Surgeon has a staff of vaccinators, and that these men are sent to some gardens and not to others; and Dr. * * * further complains of the non-receipt of vaccine lymph, and desires to know if he should undertake the responsibility of vaccination work in all gardens of which he is in medical charge. 2. Dr. * * * is wrong in thinking that Government supply vaccinators for tea-gardens. The vaccinators employed under the Civil Surgeon are intended for the general public, and not for tea- gardens. By the rules framed by the Chief Commissioner under Act I. of 1882, the duty of seeing that all children and other unprotected persons in gardens are properly vaccinated rests with the manager of the garden. Each garden must employ its own Native Doctor, or make its own arrange- ments. All that the medical officer of a garden can expect is a supply of lymph, and for this he should indent early in the season, in fact, before the vaccination season begins, say, in September; the Civil Surgeon will then send the lymph as early as possible, according to the indents he receives and the requirements of each garden. 3. Each Government vaccinator has a circle allotted to him; if a garden for any special reason requires outside aid, application should be made to the Civil Surgeon, and he will endeavour to cause the vaccinator of the circle in which the garden is situated to tender his services to the manager; but this will not relieve the management of the duty of causing vaccination to be performed thorough- ly and efficiently. 4. The Civil Surgeon is the Superintendent of Vaccination for the whole district, including gardens, and it is his duty to see that vaccination in gardens is being performed, and to inspect cases; but in gardens where there is a European Medical Officer, the Civil Surgeon would naturally leave the supervision of the vaccinators to that officer, and look to him for a report of the work done. 5. The best plan would be for Dr. * * * to send in about September a list of gardens under his care, and at the same time an indent for the lymph he may need for those gardens; at the close of the vaccination season the necessary forms will be sent to him, and he will be asked to fill them up for the gardens on his list, and to send the returns to the Deputy-Commissioner or direct to the Civil Surgeon with any explanatory remarks he may think necessary. 6. Similarly, managers of gardens which do not employ the services of a European Medical Officer should, in September, indent direct on the Civil Surgeon for lymph, and at the end of the season apply for and obtain printed forms, which they should fill in and forward to the Civil Surgeon. With few exceptions, every garden has a Native Doctor, and with a proper supply of lymph, there should be no difficulty in carrying out the requirements of the law in regard to Garden Vaccination. * * * Deputy Commissioner.

No. SResolution on the Vaccination Report in Assam for 1887-88. Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner of Assam in the General Department No. 4,858, dated 3rd September 1888. READ( 2 ) Cost of the department. 8. The total expenditure on vaccination was Rs. 13,356, against Rs. 12,136 in 1886-87. Local Funds bear nearly half the cost, and Provincial Funds, with some assistance from municipalities, the other half. Provincial Funds paid rather less, Local and Municipal rather more, in 1887-88 than in 1886-87. The average cost of a successful operation has fallen from 2 annas 0¾ pies to 1 anna 10 pies. Buffalo lymph. 9. In his concluding paragraph Dr. Eteson notices a suggestion made by the Government of India regarding the use of buffalo lymph which has been employed with success in the Punjab, where the use of other lymph is objected to. The Deputy- Surgeon-General has already reported on the subject, and the Chief Commissioner fears that, for the reasons now stated, the suggestion could not be usefully adopted in Assam.

Plan of the Report. 1. As a detailed report will be due next year, the following remarks shall be limited to brief comments on the statistics of vaccination for the past year, except where something more extended seems necessary. The Annual Report on Vaccination for the year ending 1888-89 has been prepared on the lines of that of the previous year. Statement No. III. was shown blank last year, and all the vaccinations performed in dispensaries were included in Statement No. I. appended to the report; but this year the work done by the dispensary officials has been shown in Statement No. III., and the work of the vaccination staff in Statement No. I. in accordance with the forms prescribed by the Government of India, Home Department Resolution No. 86, dated the 9th May 1877. Lymph supply. 2. Two hundred tubes of lymph were received from England and distributed to all Civil Surgeons about the middle of September 1888. The results from the use of this supply were reported as very good and generally successful. Tube lymph produced in India was as a rule obtained direct by most of the Civil Surgeons from the Sanitary Commissioner, Bengal, and Deputy-Sanitary- Commissioners, Dacca and Darjiling Circles. In some cases lymph obtained by this office from the Deputy-Sanitary-Commissioner, Darjiling Circle, was distributed to Civil Surgeons, especially in the Khási and Jaintia Hills district, and to regimental medical officers. The results of these supplies were reported as generally good. The use of bovine lymph was not found successful. TABLE No. 1.

I have ordered a capable substitute to be employed at once. Of course, the want of an energetic Civil Surgeon, and Dr. Conceicao's illness, while in the district, partly accounts for this. I have directed the Civil Surgeon to keep the Assistant-Surgeon (specially appointed) well up to vaccination inspection work in the Nága Hills district during his tours with the Deputy-Commissioner, or when able to go out independently. In the Khási and Jaintia Hills there has not been until lately a separate Civil Surgeon; but now that there is one we must look to him for a very decided improvement in regard to vaccination work for the future. Of course, the absence of a really responsible officer accounts for the backward state of vaccination in these hills, nowithstanding the exertions and good work of the medical missionaries as regards vaccination. In the Cachar district, in his covering letter forwarding the district vac- cination report, the. Deputy Commissioner explains that the decrease is attributed to the Local Boards' vaccinators not having been employed on tea-gardens in compliance with the Deputy-Surgeon-General's Circular No. 58 , dated the 28th May 1888. The managers and medical officers of gardens seem to be, at least in the Cachar district, very apathetic (as a rule) as regards vaccination. The Civil Medical Officer of Cachar also mentions that many managers are very remiss even in submitting the vaccination returns, only 83 out of 129 due having been received up to date of the submission of his general return. Either vaccination should be made compulsory on gardens, or Local Board or Government vaccinators should vaccinate in them, their work being regularly inspected by the Native Inspector and also by the Civil Surgeon. I have issued a Circular to all Civil Surgeons in the Province with the object of securing better vaccination results in the ensuing season. TABLE No. 3.

The number of vaccinations found to be unsuccessful by Native Inspectors is greater than in the previous year, probably owing to closer and more careful inspection on their part in 1888-89. The number found to be unsuccessful by the Civil Surgeons and their subordinates were much less than in the previous year. The percentage of success- ful cases, as verified by the Civil Surgeons, was 97.32 (the highest) in the Sylhet district, and 76.47 (the lowest) in the Nága Hills district. The percentage of successful cases, as verified by the Native Inspectors of vaccination, ranges from 98.05 (the highest) in Goálpára to 79.60 (the lowest) in the Cachar district. TABLE No. 4.

The total vaccinations performed on tea-gardens during the year under report were 6,650, against 6,695 in the previous year, showing a very slight decrease of 45 operations on the figures of the previous year. Of the total number of primary vaccinations for the past year, 871 were performed by Government agencies, of which 645 were successful giving 74.05 per cent. of successful operations, and 5,779 by tea-garden agencies, with 86.93 per cent. of successful operations, as compared with 1,649 and 5,046 respectively in the previous season. Government agency having been suspended in most gardens, excepting some in Cachar and Lakhimpur, will account for the divergency in the former figures from those of the previous year. Managers of tea-gardens should be requested to show more interest in this work, as the figures arrived at, although somewhat better than last year, are not satisfactory, and regular submission of these returns should be insisted on. Cachar shows a slight falling off in the grand total primarily vaccinated which would not have happend had all the returns due been received from managers; but the operations by garden agency much exceed those. of the previous season, although those by Government agency are much less, in consequence of this office Circular Memorandum No. 58., dated the 28th May 1889, approved by the Chief Commissioner, as mentioned in paragraph 5 of Resolution on the Vaccination Report of the season of 1887-88. In Sylhet, the increase in the grand total is also very marked. In Kámrúp, the grand total is even less than last year, and in Darrang it is much less. In Nowgong the figures are something better than last year, while in Sibságar they are less, which, it is explained in the report, is due to the fact of no returns having been received from the sadr division and Jorhát sub-division, the figures given being for a few gardens in the Golághát sub-division only. As Government vaccinators are only available in the former portion of this district, the absence of the returns noted apparently explains the absence of any record here of operations done by the Government agency. In the Lakhimpur district there is an improvement over the figures of the previous season. There were 5,679 total successful vaccinations, against 5,988 in previous year, and the percentage of successful cases was 85.39, or less than the 89.44 of 1887-88.

The preceding table exhibits the vaccination work done in compulsory areas under Act V. of 1880 as compared with the figures for the past three years. The number of vaccinations performed in each of these municipal areas has fallen from 1,801 in 1885-86 and from 1,669 in 1887-88 to 1,406 in 1888-89. This falling off is not satisfactory, and denotes a want of success in enforcing the Act, although in accordance with the wishes of the Chief Commissioner, conveyed in No. 861, dated 9th February, the number of notices issued under Sections 17 and 18 of Vaccination Act, XIII. of 1880 (I. C), as has been for the first time given in this table. It shows that in the Sylhet Municipality 281 notices were issued, and in Gauháti 39 notices; but in Dibrugarh no notices were found necessary to issue, as it is stated that the parents and guardians, who at first objected to allow their children to be vaccinated, submitted to vac- cination on being spoken to. Notwithstanding these notices and personal explanations to parents and guardians, the fact remains that the figures are even less than last year. Unless it can be proved that the birth-rate has fallen off since the previous season, this fact shows how very much there is still wanting to enforce vaccination in these compulsory areas, and how much there is left to Deputy-Commissioners to do in this matter. 8. By the wish of the Chief Commissioner, and in accordance with Government of India, Home Department No. 746, dated the 23rd April 1889, the following information as regards municipalities, stations, and unions is here appended, as taken from the Municipal Report for 1888-89. SylhetMunicipality. 9. Vaccination was carried on through an unpaid Superintendent of vaccination, assisted by one public vaccinator paid by the municipality. The Vaccination Act V. is in force in this municipality There were 327 operations during the year, of which 313 were successful. Dhubri Municipality. 10. At present the municipality does not contribute anything for vaccination work in the town. A vaccinator used to be entertained, but it was found that he did not find sufficient work to warrant his retention on account of the objections made by the people to have their children vaccinated. The Commissioners of the municipality have decided to introduce compulsory vaccination, and for this purpose an application has accordingly been submitted to bring into force the Vaccination Act, XIII. of 1880. There were 19 vaccinations, of which 18 were successful. Where compulsory vaccination has been sanctioned, one or two vaccinators (as required) should be entertained. Goálpára Municipality 11. No remarks on vaccinations have been furnished in the Municipal Report. The following information has been taken from the Sanitary Report of the Goálpára Municipality for 1888-89. The municipality does not contribute any expenditure on vaccination work. It is carried out by the Hospital-Assistant in medical charge of the dispensary and by a vaccinator under the supervision of the Civil Surgeon. Gauháti Municipality. 12. The Vaccination Act was in force throughout the year. The people are not opposed to the operation of the Act. A vaccinator is provided for by the municipality, and a lump-sum of Rs. 180 was, therefore placed at the disposal of the Civil Surgeon who supervises the work in the town. Four cases were instituted against those who neglected to produce their children for vaccination, and all of them were discharged with warnings. There were 581 vaccinations, of which 447 were successful.
( 6 ) Barpeta Municipality. 13. The inhabitants of this municipality, being the followers of Mahapurusia, are opposed to vaccination. The two cases shown in the table attached to the Municipal Report were amongst foreigners only. It is stated that the people will not give their free consent to the introduction of the Vaccination Act; but, if Government will introduce it for the public safety, they will submit to it. ' The fact of this matter is that they are afraid of their Gossains, or spiritual guides, who impose heavy fines on them for any violation- of longstanding customs. It is true that, for some years past, there has been no epidemic of small-pox, as actually reported, in Barpeta, yet there are numerous marks of small-pox on the person of Mahapurusias, which indicate that they are as equally subject to the disease as other classes of Assamese, and consequently that the prevalence of this disease amongst them is concealed and not registered. Dibrugarh Municipality. 14. The Vaccination Act was in force throughout the year. The work was carried on by a vaccinator on Rs. 15 per month for the vaccination season under the superintendence of the Civil Surgeon. There were 499 vaccinations performed, against 528 in the previous year. There were no prosecutions. It is reported that at present very few children are unprotected either by vaccination or small-pox. The municipality contributed Rs. 85-4-1, against Rs. 72-9-3 in 1887-88. The above report of alleged protection should be credited with caution. More energy is required, and this, no doubt, will be given by the new Civil Surgeon. Silchar Station. 15. No remarks have been made in the Municipal Report about vaccination, but the statements appended to it show that 312 vaccinations were performed during the year, of which 268 were successful. One vaccinator was employed during 1888-89. Sibságar Station 16. The vaccination work is carried on under the superintendence of teh Civil Surgeon. A vaccinator was employed for six months, and the municipality paid Rs. 55 for his pay. There were 162 vaccinations performed during the year, of which 133 were successful. The Vaccination Act No. V. is not in force at this station; it should be introduced. Shillong Station. 17. Out of a population of 2,250, the total number of vaccinations during 1888-89 was 279, and, of this number, 166 were successful. There is a permanent vaccinator employed by the Station Committee, and the total expenditure was Rs. 150. Habiganj Union. 18. The total number of operations performed during the year was 75, and the number of successful cases 55, against 68 with 50 successful cases in the previous year. There is no paid vaccinator in this union, the vaccinations having been done by the Hospital-Assistant of the dispensary. Balaganj Union. 19. There is no vaccination staff employed by the union. The Magistrate has not made any remark on this subject. It appears that only four cases of vaccinations were done by the Hospital-Assistant with the help of the compounder, which is very unsatisfactory. The attention of the Civil Surgeon of Sylhet is called to this deficiency. Sunámganj Union. 20. The number of operations performed during 1888-89 was 147, against 49 of the previous season, with 136 successful, against 87 in the pre- vious season. There was no special union agency employed. The work was carried on by the Local Board vaccinators as in the previous year. Jorhát Union. 21. A Government vaccinator was employed on Rs. 10 per month for six months, and another by the union on Rs. 10 for the two months of February and March 1889. 591 vaccinations were performed during the year as compared with 330 in 1887-88; but the rate of successful vaccinations during the year decreased by 3.8 per cent. as contrasted with the figures of last two years viz., 90.6 and 86.8 per cent. respectively. The attention of the Civil Surgeon is called to this point with a view to its remedy. The cost of each successful case was one anna and seven pies. Golághát Union. 22. The work done in this municipality shows a somewhat better result than in the previous season. There were 68 operations performed with 56 successful cases, against 67 with 47 successful cases in the previous season. There were two vaccinators employed during the season viz. one paid by Government and the other by the union. The expenditure on vaccination was Rs. 380-0-11 out of the sanctioned budget allotment of Rs. 450. The Civil Surgeon is requested to see that Government and the union are rewarded with more numerous vacci- nations and better results for this expenditure, for two vaccinators, in future.

Table No. 6 shows the licensed vaccinators' operations inspected by the Civil Surgeons and the Native Inspectors. They are chiefly employed in the Goálpára and Kámrúp districts. The number of vaccinations performed by them has increased from 19,807 in 1887-88 to 22,284 in 1888-89, and the number inspected by the Civil Surgeons and the Native Inspectors has also increased from 11,627 to 12,513 in 1888-89; but the proportion of inspections to total operations has fallen from 58 to 56 per cent., the decrease being marked in Kámrúp. The number of successful cases among those inspected has increased from 10,711 to 11,706, and the percentage of successful cases actually verified by inspection from 92.12 to 93.55. In the Goálpára district there were 18 licensed vaccinators em- ployed, who performed 14,115 cases, as compared with 11,581 operations of the preced- ing year. The work done by them in this district is reported to have been very success- ful. In the Kámrúp district there were 32 licensed vaccinators employed, against 18 in the previous season ; but the authority under which the number was increased is not explained in the Annual Vaccination Report of the Kámrúp district for 1888-89. 8,169 operations were performed by 32 licensed vaccinators, against 8,226, showing a slight decrease on the figures of the previous year. The Civil Surgeon inspected 280 cases, against none inspected in the previous season, which is so far satisfactory, but he should imitate the Civil Surgeon of the Goálpára district in the number and proportion of his inspections, as this system requires more careful inspection and supervision on his part than that done by Government vaccinators. General tables 24. Besides the preceding district tables, the Annual Statements Nos. I. to IV. are submitted. Statement No. 1. shows the population and particulars of vaccination in each district during the year, excluding the operations done by the dispensary staff. Statement No. I. A, appended to the Report since 1883-84, has been omitted this year, as it is not a prescribed form sanc- tioned by the Government of India. TABLE No. 7.

( 8 ) Relation between the state of protection enjoyed by the people and the death-rate from small-pox for the previous five years. 25. The preceding table has been drawn up with a view to illustrate the relation between the state of protection by vaccination and the pre- valence of small-pox during the past five years, vide para- graph 12 of the Chief Commissioner's Resolution on the An- nual Sanitary Report for 1887. I should here remark, with reference to the Chief Com- missioner's direction in paragraph 7 of the Resolution on the Annual Sanitary Report for 1888, that I have acted in strict compliance with the orders contained in the Resolution on the Sanitary Report for 1887, in retaining for and embodying in this report the above comparison between the supposed protection of the people against small-pox by vaccina- tion and the mortality from that disease. The position in the two scales (columns 2 and 3) occupied by the several districts shows that there is generally very little relation between the supposed state of protection and the supposed deaths from small-pox. This relation does not in any case correspond exactly. In Cachar the figures correspond nearest. We must only assume, as a cause of the general want of relation between columns 2 and 3, that either the districts are not vaccinated equally well in every part so as to give equal pro- tection throughout, or that the inspections of successful cases by Native Inspectors are unreliable, or that false returns are made, or, again, that, as has happened in Darrang, cases of measles, &c., are reported as small-pox, and thus the average of deaths for that disease is untruly increased. As I know that vaccination in the Goálpára district, for instance, is most carefully supervised and inspected by the Civil Surgeon, I cannot believe that the relation between protection and deaths is only as 3 is to 6, and therefore it must be quite incorrect. I think that this divergence between the figures is due to faults (ignorance, &c.,) on the part of the vital statistics reporting agency. Nowgong and Sibságar are not the best protected, and still the figures there show comparatively fewer deaths than protec- tions, which supports the idea that imperfect registration of deaths explains the want of better and more equal relation between columns 2 and 3. This remark applies to Sylhet also. On looking over all the above reasoning, I am of opinion that imperfect registration, rather than any deficiencies on the part of the vaccination agency, will explain the diver- gencies above noted. Now that we have began this comparison, I hope that the columns will correspond more with the actual results in the future. Statement No. II. 26. The Annual Statement No. II. gives the cost of the department in a more concise form. The total expenditure was Rs. 13,337-6-1, of which the Provincial funds contributed Rs. 6,097-13-4, Local funds Rs. 6,633-1, and municipalities Rs. 606-7-9. The average cost of each successful operation rose from one anna six pies (the lowest) in Sibságar to one rupee fourteen annas and eleven pies (the highest) in the Nága Hills. Statement No III. 27. This statement has been prepared in the manner as explained in paragraph 1 of this report. Statement No IV 28. The Annual Statement No. IV. shows the progress of vaccinations in Assam for the past ten years. The total exhibits a marked and continued gradual increase from 1880-81 to the end of the past season. The work done by the Government vaccinators has fallen from 40,464 in 1887-88 to 38,894 in 1888-89. There is also a decrease of vaccinations performed by the dispensary staffs from 6,034 in the previous season to 4,415 in the year under review. The work done by the municipal operators has sunk from 4,092 in 1887-88 to 3,176 in 1888-89. On the other hand, the work of the Local Fund vac- cinators has increased to 58,924, against 55,668 in the previous year. It is also satis- factory to note that the operations done by the licensed vaccinators has risen from 19,807 in 1887-88 to 22,284 in 1888-89 without any cost to Government. Except Goálpára and Kámrúp, all other districts are dependent on paid agency, and in such districts a beginning ought to be made to employ licensed vaccinators whose work, however, should be carefully inspected by the Civil Surgeon, as in the Goálpára district. Vaccination in Manipur. 29. One vaccinator has been employed since last year. He performed vaccinations amongst the Nága and Manipuri children from October to March 1889. No assistance of any kind was received from the Rája, and the matter was reported to the Political Agent who tried his best to improve matters, but without any success. The amount of work done during the year was very small. Only 272 operations were performed, against 607 in 1887-88, which is very unsatisfactory. It is hoped that the Political Agent will be able to secure a better result next year. This year the work was done in a limited area, near the capital, and the vaccinator of course had no permission to compel vaccination, but still persua- sion on the part of the Political Agent may effect very much in this direction.

The results of examinations made by the Civil Surgeons among certain classes of the general population to ascertain to what extent they were protected against vaccination are illustrated in the above table. The total number of persons examined was 27,070. Of this, 6,921 were vaccinated, 13,390 inoculated, 5,466 had small-pox, and 1,293 unprotected, and the results show to what extent inoculation is practised in the districts of Cachar, Groáipára, Darrang, Nowgong, and Gáro Hills. In Sylhet, vaccination has been greatly interfered with by the gunacks who are much believed in by the people, and who practice inoculation only, from which practice a very severe epidemic of small-pox broke out in the past season in Lakhai in the Habiganj sub-division of that district. I have recommended to the Chief Commissioner that all inoculation be made penal in Assam, as this practice of unchecked inoculation has resulted in serious epidemics of small-pox and loss of life resulting therefrom. The total number of schoolboys examined was very small, as compared with other classes of persons so examined, which arises from schools being but occasionally inspected, whereas dispensaries and jails are almost daily inspected at sadr stations by the Civil Surgeons. District reports. 31. As in the previous year, the Civil Surgeons have made no change in the form of their annual returns and reports. They were submitted to this office punctually. CHARLES P.

Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner of Assam, in the General Department, No. 4,562, dated the 27th July 1889. READ( 2 ) 5. The statistics embodied in paragraphs 8-22 of the report, which relate to vaccination in municipal areas, disclose considerable differences in the results, for which no sufficient reasons are apparent. Thus, it is not understood why the municipality of Goálpára- should be exempted from the necessity laid upon others of contributing towards the payment of a vaccination staff, as vaccination is peculiarly a kind of charge which municipal funds should bear. Some explanation should also have been given of the failure which tool place in the Golághát Union, where, although two vaccinators were employed during the season, the outturn of work (less than two cases each per week) compared very un favourably with that performed in the neighbouring union of Jorhát. In paragraph of the Provincial Municipal Report for the year 1887-88, the Chief Commissione expressed his hope that municipal authorities would in all cases insist upon due attention being given to the matter of vaccination, and would provide effective supervision over municipal vaccination where circumstances show this to be necessary. It was added that there should be no hesitation in allotting adequate amounts for expenditure on this important object. The present report does not, the Chief Commissioner regrets to notice, show that this hope has been realised. It is clear that the importance of vaccination is it present only imperfectly appreciated in many cases by municipal bodies, and Mr. Westlard would, therefore, again direct renewed attention to the matter. In future, municipal bodies should submit a separate report on vaccination within the areas under there control, through Deputy-Commissioners, to the Sanitary Commissioner, who will be requested to give especial attention to this branch of vaccination work. 6. In conclusion, the Chief Commissioner desires to notice the careful supervisior, and the consequent success, of Surgeon E. Dobson, Civil Surgeon of Goálpára. The natural consequences of the active interest taken by Surgeon Dobson in the work c vaccination have been fully illustrated in the year under report, as in previous years, by the results obtained in the Goálpára district.

REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE PROVINCE OF ASSAM FOR THE YEAR 1889-90. GENERAL SUMMARY. Plan of the report. 1. As a detailed report is due for the year 1889-90 in accordance with the Resolution of the Government of India, Home Department/Medical, No. 28/1,579.95 , dated the 15th July 1887, the remarks contained in this report give a full history and general result of the working of the department during the year under review. The report is prepared in accordance with the plan as required in the above noted Resolution. The statements appended to this report first show the work done and their results; secondly, the expenditure; thirdly, the work done in the dispensaries by the dispensary staff; and, fourthly, the primary vaccinations and their results. Lymph supply. 2. The first annual supply of lymph from England was received here on the 23rd September 1889, and was distributed to the several Civil Surgeons on the 27th September. A second supply of English lymph was received from the Sanitary Commissioner, Bengal. A third and fourth supply of English lymph were received, and all these were distributed to the several Civil Surgeons. The results, as reported by the Civil Surgeons, were very successful in every district except Cachar, where the greater part of it did not prove to be successful. The ordinary supplies of lymph received from the Sanitary Commissioner, Bengal, Deputy- Sanitary-Commissioners, Darjeeling and Dacca Circles, were also reported generally good and successful. The bovine lymph received from these sources was reported as unsuccess- ful. TABLE No. 1. Showing the agency employed in each district of the Province during the years 1886-87 to 1889-90.

The table in the preceding page exhibits the number of vaccinators, inspectors, and other classes of operators employed in each district in 1889-90, as compared with those in the previous three years. The number has risen from 214 in 1886-87 to 252 in 1889-90, but the total number of operators in 1889-90 shows a very slight increase, as compared with the figures in 1888- 89. The marked increase in the number of Hospital-Assistants and compounders, as contrasted with these classes of operators in the previous year, is due to the opening of new Local Board dispensaries. The number of Native Inspectors of Vaccination rose from 12 in 1888-89 to 13 in 1889-90, which is due to the appointment of the Hospital- Assistant in charge of the Rainagar municipal dispensary, who acted as Inspector of Vaccination in the Sylhet town. The number of licensed vaccinators decreased from 50 in 1888-89 to 41 in 1889-90 caused by the number of this class of operators having been reduced from 32 to 20 in Kámrúp in the year under report. In Goálpára the number rose from 18 to 20. TABLE NO.2. Showing increase and decrease of Vaccination work in each district during the four years 1886-87 to 1889-90. District. Total number vaccinated.

The preceding table shows separately the vaccinations performed on tea-gardens by garden as well as by Government agencies during 1889-90. The total number of vaccinations performed on tea-gardens was 9,992, against 6,650 in 1888-89, showing an increase of 3,342 over the figures of the previous year. There were 8,251 successful cases, against 5,679 in the previous season, and the percentage of successful cases was 82.57. as compared with 85.39 in the past year. Of the total number of 9,992 vaccinations, 9,217 were performed by garden agencies, of which 7,587 were found successful, giving a percentage of 82.31 successful operations; 775 were done by Government agencies, with 83.09 per cent. of successful cases. As mentioned in paragraph 6 of last year's report, with some exceptions in Cachar and Lakhimpur, managers now arrange for their own vaccination work, Civil Surgeons supplying lymph and inspecting when visiting gardens. It will be obvious, both from this and from Table No. 3, that the percentage of successful vaccinations by garden agency is much less than that done by the Government vaccinators. Sylhet, Cachar, and Lakhimpur, in the order given, show the highest grand total figures, Cachar not being first in this respect, as happened in the previous year, and Sylhet gives 1,773 more than in 1888-89, Lakhimpur showing 1,666 more operations than in the previous year, both cases proving the much greater interest taken by managers in this important matter in the past year in these two districts, and this greater interest is confined to those two districts, as Darrang and Nowgong only show a moderate increase, and Sibságar a considerable decrease. The proprietors and managers in the Sibságar district ought to be addressed on this subject. TABLE NO.5. Name of munici- pality or cantonment Population according to the Census of 1881.

The total number of operations performed was 1,734 in 1889-90, against 1,406 in 1888-89, showing an increase of 328 over the figures of the previous year, which is a good improvement. In Sylhet 352 notices were issued. In Gauháti there were 7 prosecutions and 7 punishments ; 40 notices were issued at this station. In the Dibrugarh Municipality no notices were issued for the reason explained in paragraph 7 of last year's report. TABLE NO.6.

Inspection of licensed vaccinators' work. 8. The number of licensed vaccinators' operations inspected by the Civil Surgeons and Native Inspectors of Vaccination during 1889-90 is recorded in the above table The number of vaccinations performed by this class of operators amounted to 18,758, as compared with 22.284 in 1888-89, showing a decrease of 3,526 operations over the figures of the previous season. Of this number, 2,547 were inspected by the Civil Surgeons, of which 2,361 were found successful, as compared with 3,252 and 3,021 respectively in 1888-89. The number of operations seen by the Native Inspectors of Vaccination shows a slight decrease of 167, as compared with the figures in the previous season. The decrease is accounted for by the falling off in the number of licensed vaccinators, which was reduced from 50 in 1888-89 to 41 in 1889-90. Of the number inspected by the Native Inspectors, 8,529. or 93.79 per cent., were found successful, as compared with 8,685, or 93.78 per.cent., in the previous season ; but the former number shows a greater percentage of successful cases on the smaller total of operations done in the past year. The reduction in the number of licensed vac- cinators arose from 12 less of this class having been employed in the Kámrúp district than in the previous year, although one was employed this year in the Sibságar district and two more were added to the Goálpára staff by Dr. Dobson, who prefers them to paid vaccina- tors, as it is, in his opinion, more to their interest to work well, and certainly their average of successful cases is, in the Goálpárá district, better than the corresponding average in the other districts, where the work is done by paid or by Provincial vaccinators.

The preceding table corresponds with Table No.7, paragraph 24 of last year's Vaccination Report for this Province, and also with the table given in paragraph 40 of the Report on Vaccination for the Central Provinces for the year 1885-86, according to the orders of the Chief Commissioner of Assam in paragraph 12 of his Resolution on the Sanitary Report for 1887. It is based on all the successful vaccinations of the previous five years. The figures in the columns agree in a. greater degree than those in the correspond- ing table at page 7 of last year's report, and Goálpára gives corresponding figures in columns 2 and 3. Notwithstanding this improvement, the remarks in paragraph 25 of last year's report apply generally here also Annual Statement No. I., explanation of 10. The Annual Statement No. I. appended to this report exhibits the work of the vaccination staff, viz., of the Native Inspectors of Vaccination, of the Provincial, Local Board, municipal, and licensed vaccinators and apprentices, as well as the work done on tea-gardens by garden agency. During the year under report a grand total of 130,238 operations were performed by the whole vaccination staff, of which 74,112 were males and 56,126 were females, as com- pared with a grand total of 123,880 operations in the previous year. One hundred and twenty-nine thousand eight hundred and sixteen were primary operations, of which 1,20,206, or 92.59 per cent., were successful, and 422 were re-vaccinations, of which 351, or 83.17 per cent., were successful Out of a total of 120,206 successful vaccinations, 15,239 persons so vaccinated were under one year, 73,243 were over one and under six years, and 31,724 were over six years of age. In 1889-90 an aggregate of 24.49 persons were successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of the population, and for the previous five years the annual average was 21.87 per mille of population. It would appear from columns 16 and 18 of this statement that the largest number of persons, who have been successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of the population, has been in the Gáro Hills district. Darrang and Sibságar come next in this respect. The Nága Hills, Khási Hills, and Sylhet are still very backward with regard to the vaccinations per mille of population, although the increase in the actual number of operations in Sylhet in the past year has been so far satisfactory. The average'annual number of deaths from small-pox during the previous five years, i.e., from 1884 to 1888, was .41 per mille of population. It was highest (.96 per mille of population) in Darrang, and (.07) lowest in the Nowgong district. Annual Statement No II., explanation of 11. The Annual Statement No. II. shows the cost of the department in 1889-90. The total expenditure was Rs. 13,769-10-11. Of this amount, Rs. 5,843-10-6 were contributed by Government, Rs. 7,069-9-9 by Local Boards, and Rs. 856-6-8 by the Municipalities. The average cost of each successful case for the whole Province was 2 annas 1¾ pie It was remarkably, and indeed ridiculously, high in the Nága Hills district, which arose from what the Deputy-Commissioner describes( 7 ) as he only did 20 operations from June 1889 to 31st March 1890, and of this number only 12 proved successful. A report should have been sent to me, and my assistance asked for, before October 1889, which was not done. As soon as I knew of the matter (just lately), I at once directed the Civil Surgeon, Sylhet, to select a good Muhammadan from that district (as suggested by Mr. Porteous, Deputy-Commissioner), and to send him to the Nága Hills as vaccinator at once. The Civil Surgeon should have taken early action in this matter. The cost was lowest in Manipur, where it was only at 1 anna 2 pie per case. Statement No. III., explanation of 12. Annual Statement No. III. shows the number of operations performed at the dispensaries by the dispensary staff. The total number of primary vaccinations performed by this class of operators amounted to 7,222, against 4,415 in 1888-89, and of that number 6,743 were successful, showing a percentage of 93.37 of successful cases, as compared with 3,975 total successful and a percentage of 90.03 in the previous year. Out of the above-noted total of 7,222 dispensary vaccinations, 5,845 were performed in the dispensaries in the Sylhet district, as compared with 2,950 in 1888-89, which shows a great advance, as compared with the work done than in any previous season. In the Khási and Jaintia Hills district the figures have risen from 3 in 1888-89 to 182 in 1889-90, which is a great improvement; in Goálpára from 280 to 305. In Cachar there was a falling off of 180 operations, as compared with the figures in the previous year, in Darrang 73, and in Sibságar 61. There was a slight decrease in the districts of Lakhimpur, Nowgong, and Nága Hills. Statement No. IV. 13. Annual Statement No. IV. shows the number of primary vaccinations, with their results, for the past nine years, as compared with 1889-90. This statement shows a continued marked improvement in the work effected, from 24,163 operations with 21,170 successful cases in 1880-81 to 146,338 with 134,579 successful cases in 1889-90. The work done by Government vaccinators rose from 38,894 in 1888-89 to 44,929 in 1889-90, by dispensary staff from 4,415 to 7,222, by Municipality from 3,176 to 4,127, by Local Fund vaccinators from 58,924 to 62,005, by licensed vaccinators from 22,284 to 18,755, and by tea-garden agency from 5,779 to 9,217. There was a marked decrease of 3,529 vaccinations performed by the licensed vaccinators, as compared with those of the previous year. This was chiefly due to the reduction of the number of this class in the Kámrúp district from 32 in 1888-89 to 20 in 1889-90, or a reduction of 12, slightly counterbalanced in the Groálpára district by the addition of two and the appointment of one in the Sibságar district over the numbers of the previous year.

( 8 ) TABLE No. 8.( 9 ) Dr. Dobson devotes much attention to the training of the licensed and other vacci- nators, and insists on each depositing, as security, from Rs. 10 to Rs. 20, which is forfeited, as previously agreed on, by carelessness, misconduct, &c.; and rewards are given for successful and good vaccination. He mentions the following licensed vaccinators as having done 1,000 operations each in the past season:( 10 ) Results. 22. 7,731 vaccinations were performed during the year, against 10,263 in 1888-89. Of these, 7,685 were primary vaccinations and 46 second- ary, as compared with 10,097 primary and 166 secondary in the previous year. The percentages of successful cases were 91.72 in the primary and 78.26 in the secondary vaccinations, as compared with 87.47 and 91.57 respectively in the previous season. The Government vaccinators each performed, on an average, 748 vaccinations, and the Local Board vaccinators 747. The Municipal vaccinator performed only 180 operations, which is very unsatisfactory. Inspections. 23. There were 2,528 cases verified by inspections. Of these, 215 were by the Civil Surgeon, 50 by the Assistant-Surgeon, and 2,263 by the Native Inspector of Vaccinations, showing a percentage of successful cases verified by each, of 92.09, 96, and 89.96 respectively. The inspection of vaccination by the Civil Surgeon was greatly interfered with by his absence in Lushai with the Surma Valley police force as noted above. The Military Medical Officer, acting in Dr. Partridge's absence, could not be spared from the sadr station, hence the falling off both in the number of operations and in the Civil Surgeon's inspections. Vaccinations on tea-gardens. 24. Out of a garden population of 41,042 in this district, 2,594 persons were pri- marily vaccinated, of which 2,258 were successful, giving 87.04 per cent. of successful cases, as compared with 2,677 thus vaccinated in the previous year, 2,358 successful, and 88.08 per cent. of successful cases in that year. Protection enjoyed by the indigenous popula- tion from small-pox. 25. The table below shows the protection enjoyed by the indigenous population from small-pox:( 11 ) Compulsory vaccination. 31. The Vaccination Act is compulsory in the municipal area in the Sylhet town. Expenditure. 32. The total cost of the vaccination establishment was Rs. 2,894-15-11, and of this amount Rs. 1,245-1-6 were paid by Government, Rs. 1,437-8-9 by Local Funds, and Rs. 212-5-8 by Munici- palities. The average cost of each successful case was 1 anna 6 ½ pie. GOÁLPÁRA. Staff. 33. Dr. Dobson, Civil Surgeon, has been the Superintendent of Vaccination through- out the year. There were under his orders one Native Inspector, one Government vaccinator, one Local Board vaccinator, and 20 licensed vaccinators, total 23. Results. 34. The number of operations performed by all classes of operators amounted to 15,582, against 15,062 in 1888-89, or 520 in excess of the previous year. Of this number, 772 were performed by the Native Inspector, 1,240 by the Government vaccinator, 627 by the Local Board vaccinator, and 12,943 by licensed vaccinators. It will be observed that the work done by the licensed vaccinator is about five times in excess of the work done by the paid agency. Inspections. 35. Inspection in this district was good. Out of a total of 15,887 vaccinations, 9,517 cases were verified, viz., 3,220 by the Civil Surgeon, with 92.11 per cent. of successful cases, and 6,297 by the Native Inspector, with 95.15 per cent. of successful cases. Vaccination of immigrants. 36. There are no tea-gardens in this district, but the vaccinators performed opera- tions on newly-arrived and other immigrants. Vaccina- tion is not compulsory in the district. Lymph. 37. The lymph supplied by the Sanitary Commissioner, Assam, proved to be very good. The lymph supplied by the Sanitary Commissioner, Bengal, and Deputy-Sanitary Commissioner, Darjeeling Circle, was also reported generally good. Arm-to-arm vaccination is performed as far as possible. Expenditure. 38. The total expenditure on vaccination in this district was Rs. 331 only, and of this amount Rs. 70 were paid by Government, and Rs. 261 by the Local Board. The average cost of each successful case was 2 annas. KÁMRÚP. Staff. 39. Dr. Nandi was in charge of the district from the beginning of the year to 10th November 1889, and Dr. J. Mullane held charge during the rest of the season from 11th November 1889 to 31st March 1890 The working staff comprised one Inspector, 4 Government vaccinators, one Municipal vaccinator, 7 Local Board vaccinators, and 20. licensed vaccinators, total 33. Results. 40. The total number of vaccinations performed by these operators amounted to 12,750, against 15,839 in 1888-89. Of this number, 295 were performed by the Native Inspector, 2,491 by Govern- ment vaccinators, 516 by the Municipal vaccinator, 4,368 by Local Board vaccinators, and 5,080 by licensed vaccinators, as compared with 175, 3,204, 526, 3,765, and 8,169 respectively in 1888-89. The successful cases were 11,527, or 91.04 per cent., as con- trasted with 14,618 successful cases, or 92.38 per cent., in the previous year. 10,084 cases were verified by inspections, and of these 1,356 cases were inspected by the Civil Surgeon, 385 by the Hospital-Assistant of Barpeta, and 8,343 by the Native Inspector. Lymph source. 41. The preliminary operations were commenced in Gauháti on the 15th September by 4 tubes of lymph received from the Deputy-Sanitary Commissioner, Darjeeling Circle, and with these one case was successfully vaccinated. Subsequently, 22 tubes were received from the Sanitary Commissioner, Bengal; all the cases vaccinated from this source proved a failure. On the 29th September 16 English lymph tubes were received from the Sanitary Commissioner, Assam, and from this source 42 cases were successfully vaccinated; from these successful cases a large stock of lymph was raised, which was distributed to the vaccinators before they started work. Opposition to vaccination. 42. In some portion of the district the opposition to vaccination is still great, and in many villages in the district not a single case has hitherto been vaccinated. The Vaccination Act is compulsory in the Gauháti municipal area only. There were 7 prosecutions, and conviction was obtained in each case. c2
( 12 ) Expenditure. 43. The total expenditure on vaccination in this district amounted to Rs. 1,609-9. Of this amount, Rs. 348-15 were paid by Government, Rs. 1,080-10 by Local Funds, and Rs. 180 by the Munici- pality. The average cost of each successful case was 3 annas 8 pie. DARRANG. Superintendence and staff. 44. The vaccination staff employed during the year under the superintendence of Dr. S. Borah was composed of (a) two Native Inspectors, who were paid by the Local Boards at Rs. 25 for six months of the vaccination season and at Rs. 12 for the other six months of the year, one of whom was employed in the sadr division and the other in the Mangaldai sub-division; (b) four Provincial vaccinators, two in each sub-division; (c) eleven Local Board vaccinators, seven in Tezpur and four in Mangaldai; and (d) one apprentice vaccinator. Results. 45. The average number of persons vaccinated was 1,285 by each Local Board vaccina- tor in Mangaldai and only 681 in Tezpur. Each Provincial vaccinator performed 1,105 cases in Tezpur and 1,099 cases in Mangaldai. The Mangaldai Native Inspector performed 605 operations, and the Tezpur Inspector only 117 operations. The apprentice vaccinator performed 105 opera- tions. The total work done by the vaccination staff during 1889-90 amounted to 15,147 operations, of which 13,724, or 90.60 per cent., proved successful, as compared with 12,868 operations, of which 11,409, or 88.66 per cent., were successful in 1888-89. Besides these, 174 vaccinations were performed by the Civil Surgeon and 57 by the Hospital-Assistants, and their work is shown together in Annual Statement No. III., appended to this report. Inspections. 46. The Civil Surgeon inspected 1,855 operations, the Mangaldai Native Inspector 6,718, and the Tezpur Native Inspector 3,975. Of these, 1,669, or 89.90 per cent., 5,588, or 83.17 per cent., and 3,940, or 99.11 per cent., respectively were found successful, Supply of lymph. 47. English lymph in tubes was first received in September, and operations began on the 1st October both at Tezpur and Mangaldai. When the lymph became plentiful in these centres, the vaccinators, who were detailed off, being armed with purwanas duly countersigned by the Deputy-Com- missioner, were sent to their respective localities. All the English lymph proved successful. The human lymph was also successful, but the bovine lymph proved unsuccessful. Lymph was stored in tubes and ivory points. Expenditure. 48. The total expenditure was Rs. 2,089-12, of which the Local Board contributed Rs. 1,657-2, the Government Rs. 432-10, as compared with Rs. 1,933-2, Rs. 1,347-6, and Rs. 580-12 respectively of the pre- vious year. This shows that the Government paid Rs. 153-2 less than in the previous year, which is attributed to the pay of a Native Inspector, which was formerly debited to the Provincial revenues, being now debited to the Local Fund. The average cost of 13,640 successful operations by paid agency was 2 annas 5 pie each, which is less by 3½ pies than the cost in the previous year. NOWGONG. Superintendence. 49. Vaccination was carried on in this district under the superintendence of the Civil Medical Officer. His continued efforts to remove the opposition of the people to vaccination is very creditable. Letters from certain influential Gossains, advising their followers to submit to vaccina- tion, were obtained and used by the vaccinators, and were of great use. Copies of Sanskrit slokas permitting vaccinations were extracted from the Hindu sacred books by a Gossain. These were shown to the people and were, in some instances, effective. Staff. 50. The vaccination staff in this district consisted of one Provincial Native Inspector, employed for six months; three Provincial vaccinators, of whom one was permanent and two temporary; and of nine Local Board vaccinators, all of whom were temporary. Results. 51. The Native Inspector performed 327 vaccinations, besides 5,597 inspections. The average number of persons vaccinated by each Provincial vaccinator was 851, and by each Local Board vaccinator 774, against 705 and 766 respectively in the previous year. Of the vaccinators, seven did good work, while five had to be punished by fine for inattention or bad work. Two hundred and fifty one vaccinations were performed by the Civil Medical Officer and only 33 by the two Hospital-Assistants, as contrasted with 239 and 70 respectively in the preceding
( 13 ) year. Besides these, 9,849 operations were performed by the vaccination staff, of which number, 8,500, or 86.30 per cent., proved successful, against 9,217 in the previous year, of which 7,961, or 86.37 per cent., were successful. Inspection. 52. The Civil Medical Officer verified 1,960 cases by inspection, and found 89.80 per cent. to have been successful. The Native Inspector verified 5,597 cases, and found 91.81 per cent. successful, against 5,318, or 90.93 per cent., successful in the preceding year. The Native Inspector, Mahajan Ali, is reported as attentive and diligent in his work and deserving of praise. Supply of lymph 53. A small supply of lymph was obtained in September to start vaccination in and around the town. The vaccinators and apprentices were called together and carefully instructed. As soon as lymph had been raised, it was given to the more reliable vaccinators to start vaccination in the mauzas. The supply of English lymph, as well as that received from Bengal, was also distributed. The former supply proved successful, but the latter failed in some instances. Prevalence of small-pox. 54. There has not been any epidemic of small-pox during the past five years, and not a single death from this disease occurred during the past two years. Expenditure. 55. The total expenditure on vaccination amounted to Rs. 1,155-11, of which the Government paid Rs. 534-8 and the Local Board Rs. 621-3. The total expenditure for 188S-89 was Rs, 1,047-7-6, of which the Government paid Rs. 533-8 and the Local Board Rs. 513-15-6. The average cost of each successful case was 2 annas and 2 pie, as compared with 2 annas 1 pie in 1888-89. SIBSÁGAR. Superintendence and staff. 56. The vaccination staff employed in this district under the superintendence of Surgeon H. C. Banerji consisted of one Native Inspector, 3 Provincial, 3 Municipal, 14 Local Board vaccinators, and one licensed vaccinator. Results. 57. The Native Inspector performed 164 vaccinations. The Provincial vaccinators performed, on an average for each, 1,383 cases, which is creditable. Each Local Board vaccinator performed an average of 856 cases, and each Municipal vaccinator 552 cases. Work done by licensed vaccinator. 58. An old Ahom, who used to practise inoculation secretly in remote Miri villages at the foot of the Nága Hills, was employed as a licensed vaccinator by the Civil Surgeon, in consultation with the Deputy-Commissioner. He performed 736 cases, of which 642, or 87.34 per cent., proved successful. 279 of his operations were examined by the Native Inspector, and 83.87 per cent. were found successful. He was allowed 1 anna for every case he vaccinated. Purwannas to vaccinators and mauzadárs. 59. All the vaccinators were provided with purwannas signed by the Deputy - Commissioner, Assistant-Commissioner, or Civil Surgeon, in which the mauzas allotted to each vaccinator were noted. Purwannas were also issued to the mauzadárs to help the vaccinators in their work, and to instruct the mandals and gaonburas to do the same. Results. 60. The amount of work done during the year by the vaccination staff was 18,696, against 15,881 of the previous year, showing an increase of 2,815 cases. The Hospital-Assistant performed 17 opera- tions, against 78 of the preceding year. The work was spread over a large area, but the places allotted to the vaccinators were thoroughly vaccinated. Inspections. 61. Of the total number of 18,713 vaccinations performed, 2,599 were inspected by the Civil Surgeon, with 2,513 cases, or 96.69 per cent., of successful cases, 380 by the Hospital-Assistant, with 355, or 93.42 per cent., successful, and 8,691 by the Native Inspector, with 8,043, or 92.54 per cent., successful cases. Expenditure. 62. The total expenditure amounted to Rs. 1,483-11-4, against Rs. 1,422-2-8 of the previous year, and the average cost of each successful case was 1 anna 4¾ pie, as contrasted with 1 anna 62/3 pie, in the preceding year. LAKHIMPUR. Superintendence and staff. 63. The annual report has been written by Dr. Daly, who has been Superintendent of Vaccination throughout the year. There were four Pro- vincial, one Municipal, and seven Local Board vaccinators under his orders. The district was divided into twelve divisions, one division being allotted to each vaccinator, who was held responsible for the work in that division.
( 14 ) Results. 64. The number of operations performed rose from 7,794 in 1888-89 to 9,017 in 1889-90. The percentage of successful cases was 81.82 as compared with 85.30 in the previous season. The work was spread over a large area in a fairly definite manner. Supply of lymph. 65. The lymph supply received from the different sources in Bengal proved failures, and those received from the Sanitary Commissioner, Assam, were reported as generally good. Inspections. 66. Out of a total of 9,017 operations performed during the year, 1,328 cases were inspected by the Civil Surgeon, of which 1,123 were found successful. In this district the inspection of vaccinations in the villages is a matter of great difficulty, as the villages are scattered over a large area in which there are paddy-fields and jungles, and are in many cases approached by narrow paths. Feelings of the people towards vaccination. 67. On the whole, the attitude and feeling of the population is not against vaccination. If objections are raised, they can be overcome by the mauza- dárs with the help of the Deputy-Commissioner and the Civil Surgeon. Inoculation. 68. There was no practice of inoculation in this district, and no such case was re- ported to the Civil Surgeon. Prevalence of small-pox. 69. There was no outbreak of small-pox during the year. Vaccination is com- pulsory in the Dibrugarh Municipality. The town population are reported to be fairly well protected. Expenditure. 70. The total expenditure of the establishment amounted to Rs. 1,136-4, and of this amount, Rs. 506-2 were paid by Government, Rs. 558-2 by Local Funds, and Rs. 72 by the municipality. The average cost of each successful case was 2 annas 5½ pie. NÁGA HILLS. Superintendence. 71. The vaccination work is nominally under the superintendence of the Civil Surgeon, who, however, being a military medical officer, cannot leave the sadr station except occasionally, when there is urgent reason for so doing. Results. 72. The Assistant-Surgeon performed only one operation in Kohima, which proved successful. He should devote more time and attention to such an important part of his work when travelling; with the Deputy-Commissioner in the district, and I have drawn the attention of the Civil Surgeon to this matter. As the Assistant-Surgeon is a specially selected officer of European qualifications in medicine and surgery, it was intended from the outset that he should perform such district work outside the sadr station, under the orders of the Civil Surgeon, as is usually done by the Civil Surgeon. Three Hospital-Assistants performed 12 vaccinations, of which only 4 were successful, and the Compounder performed 2 vaccina- tions, both of which were unsuccessful. There was only one vaccinator paid by Govern- ment. He vaccinated only 20 cases at Wokha and the surrounding places Of these, 12 cases, or a percentage of 60, were successful. In 1888-89, the Provincial vaccinator performed 71 operations with 87.32 per cent. successful, as compared with 1,299 cases and 94.53 per cent. successful in 1887-88. The results of vaccination work are very unsatisfactory in this district, and compare most unfavourably with those of the previous years. During the year under report, altogether 35 operations were performed in this district, of which 17 were successful. In 1888-89, there were 88 operations, with 75 successful, and in 1887-88, 1,308 operations, with 1,229 successful cases. The Angámi and Kutcha Nágas are averse to vaccination. The other tribes allow it to be performed only in some villages. See remarks in paragraph 11 of this report. Expenditure. 73. The total expenditure was Rs. 165, being the pay of one vaccinator at Rs. 15 per mensem for 11 months; and, as he performed only 12 cases successfully, the average cost of each successful case amounted to Rs. 13-12; the cost having been Re. 1-14-11 in 1888-89, and in 1887-88 it was 2 annas and 4 pie only.
( 15 ) KHÁSI AND JAINTIA HILLS. Superintendence and staff. 74. There were three provincial vaccinators and one municipal. Of the provincial vaccinators, one worked under the missionary at Mauphlong; the other two were under the superintendence of the Civil Surgeon, Dr. R. Neil Campbell, who was in charge of the district throughout the year. Of these two vaccinators, one was permanent, and the other temporary for six months. Results. 75. During the year under report 3,028 operations were performed by the vacci- nation staff as contrasted with 3,062 in 1888-89, and the percentage of primary successful cases was 87.64, as com- pared with 82.39 of the previous year. The Civil Surgeon performed 161 operations, and the Hospital-Assistant 53. Inspections 76. The Civil Surgeon inspected the work about the station of Shillong and also in two villages beyond Cherra towards Shella. He examined 296 cases, of which 262, or 88.51 per cent., were found successful. Lymph source. 77. Lymph was obtained through the Deputy-Surgeon-General, Assam District. English lymph and lymph received from Darjeeling were successful, but the former was preferred. Feelings of the people towards vaccination. 78. In some places in the remote portions of the district the feelings of the indigenous population are hostile towards vaccination, and even in and about Shillong the help of the civil authorities had to be obtained. No opposition is met with amongst the Khásia converts of the Welsh Missionaries. Expenditure. 79. The total cost was Rs. 761-2-7 in 1889-90, against Rs. 736-7 in 1888-89, and the average cost of each successful case was 4 annas and 7 pie, against 4 annas and 9 pie. GÁRO HILLS. Superintendence and staff. 80. Dr. P. M. Gupta, the Civil Medical Officer, superintended the vaccination work in this district throughout the season. There were six provincial vaccinators employed, and they averaged 987.5 operations each. They all performed a total of 5,925 primary vaccinations, and of these, 5,830, or 98.39 per cent., were successful, as compared with 5,894 operations and 5,788, or 98.20 per cent. successful of the previous year. The Civil Medical Officer and the Hospital-Assistant performed no vaccinations. Inspections. 81. 1,028, or 17.35 per cent. of the total vaccinations, were inspected by the Civil Medical Officer, of which 997, or 96.98 per cent., were found successful. In 1888-89 he was able to verify by inspection 2,348 cases, but his inspections in 1889-90 show a decrease of 1,320 cases. This decrease is due to the reasons given in paragraph 4 of this report. Disadvantages explained 82. All the vaccinators were old hands, and therefore no measures were neces- sary to train them. At the beginning of the season one vaccinator fell sick and resigned, and it was over a month before another man was found to replace him. The head vaccinator was also ill and under treatment for nearly three weeks. Two of the vaccinators were convicted for having fraudulently exacted money from. Gáros, and were sentenced to imprisonment about the middle of February, and nobody was found at that late period to replace them. In spite of these disadvantages, the number of operations performed in 1889-90, although it does not show any perceptible increase as compared with that of 1888-89, does not show any diminution. Lymph. 83. Lymph was obtained from Calcutta, Dacca, and Darjeeling, and also ten tubes of English lymph were received from the Sanitary Commissioner, Assam. The results were fairly successful. Expenditure. 84. The total cost of vaccination amounted to Rs. 813-15-1, which was entirely borne by Government, there being no Local Board nor municipality in this district. The total expenditure in 1888-89 was Rs. 931-13-9, and the average cost of each successful case was 2 annas and 6¾ pie, but in 1889-90 the average cost was 2 annas and 2¾ pie, which is an improvement.
( 16 ) MANIPUR. Vaccination in Manipur. 85. One vaccinator was employed for six months in vaccinating the Nága and Manipuri children. 1,064 persons were vaccinated, against 272 in the previous year, of whom 676 were males and 388 females. 852 were primary vaccinations, of which 798 were successful. 212 persons were re-vaccinated with 180 successful. The percentage of success on the cases operated on was for primary vaccination 93.66 and for re-vaccination 84.90. The number success- fully vaccinated per mille of the population was 4.42, the corresponding ratio during the previous five years having been 7.86. There was no small-pox recorded during the year. It will be seen from the above that the total number vaccinated and those proving successful were much greater in the past than in the previous year. VACCINATIONS IN MUNICIPALITIES, STATIONS AND UNIONS. Statistics of municipalities, &c., recorded separately. 86. In accordance with the instructions laid down in paragraph 3 of Circular No. 5J., dated 31st January 1890, from the Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam, which, it is understood, supersedes the orders contained in the last portion of paragraph 5 of the Chief Commissioner's Resolution on the Annual Vaccination Report of Assam for 1888- 89, the following information as regards vaccination in municipalities, stations, and unions has been furnished by the Civil. Surgeons, and in some instances by the municipal authorities, and such information has been separately detailed in this report in accord- ance with Government of India, Home Department, No. 746, dated 23rd April 1890. Sylhet Municipality. 87. One vaccinator was engaged by the municipality for five and a half months. He performed 484 primary operations, with 470, or 97.10 per cent., successes. He was employed under the supervision of the municipal Hospital-Assistant, for which the latter received Rs. 10 a month, and inspected 364 operations. The total cost paid by the municipality was Rs.175-7-8, against Rs.45 in the previous year. The average cost of each successful case was 5 annas and 11 pie, which is very high. The Civil Surgeon reports that 97 per cent. of the population are protected by vaccination. Dhubri Municipality 88. This municipality offered to contribute Rs. 10 a month during the season ; but the contribution was not paid, as the operations performed by the vaccinator were very few, and did not justify the expenditure, and as it was found quite possible for the Hospital-Assistant and the Inspector of Vaccination to do all cases between themselves. The total births within the municipal limits were annually very small. Sixty-five operations were performed in 1889-90, against 19 in 1888-89. Goálpára Municipality. 89. The municipality did not contribute any thing towards the expenditure on vaccina- tion work. Vaccination was carried on by the Hospital-Assist- ant in medical charge of the dispensary and by a licensed vaccinator. There were 95 operations performed during the year, of which 90 were suc- cessful. Vaccination is not compulsory in this municipality. Gauháti Municipality. 90. A permanent vaccinator on Rs. 15 a month was employed during the year. 541 operations were performed within the municipal limits, of which 422 were successful, against 581 and 447 respectively in the previous year. The Vaccination Act was compulsory within the municipal area. Seven prosecutions were instituted against parents who refused to allow their children to be vaccinated, and conviction was obtained in each case. The total expenditure on vaccination was Rs. 180 in 1889-90. Barpeta Municipality. 91. This municipality contributed nothing to meet the expenditure on vaccination. As stated in the previous year's report, the inhabitants, being chiefly the followers of the Mahapurusia religion, will not accept vaccination unless and until it is made compulsory in this municipality, During the year under report 82 children were vaccinated within the municipal limits by the Local Board vaccinator and by the Hospital-Assistant in medical charge of the dispensary. Of the 82 vaccinated, 75 were children of Doms or fishermen by caste, and 7 Bengalis, who were not followers of the Mahapurusia religion. Out of the 82 opera- tions, 51 were successful, against 2 only in the previous year. Dibrugarh Municipality. 92. The vaccination work was carried on by a vaccinator paid by the municipality at Rs. 12 a month. 626 persons were vaccinated during the season, of whom 504 were successful, against 499 and 436 respectively of the previous season. The number of births registered during the year 1889 was 312, against 199 in the preceding year. Act XIII. of 1880 was in force throughout the year, but no prosecutions were found necessary under the Act. Some
( 17 ) Marwaris objected to have their children vaccinated, but their objections were overcome without recourse to criminal proceedings. The total expenditure borne by the munici- pality was Rs. 72, against Rs. 82-4-1 in the previous year. Silchar Station. 93. A separate report has been prepared by the Vice-Chairman, Babu Har Kisor Gupta which deals with the subject in full. During the year under report the Station Committee entertained a permanent vacci- nator at Rs. 15 a month, who also acted as a registrar of vital statistics within the station limits. He worked under the direct supervision of the Civil Surgeon, and performed 180 operations, of which 170 were successful, against 312 and 268 respectively in the preceding year. The falling off in the number of vaccinations is due to the fact that the number shown in the preceding year included the operations performed in the suburbs also, whereas the figures for the year under report represent the vaccinations performed within the station limits only. The vaccinator, owing to his twofold duties, could not be employed outside the station. The Civil Surgeon and the Deputy-Commis- sioner are of opinion that vaccination should be made compulsory in this station. A suggestion has been made in the report for the employment as vaccinators of young native doctors properly qualified, and who have not obtained any employment since passing their examination on whose work the people would, it is said, put greater reliance. If they would engage to serve as vaccinators for a year, this would be a good idea in many respects, which, however, is doubtful. I shall ask the opinions of Civil Surgeons as to the likelihood of this proposal proving a practicable one. Deducting the actual cost for registration of vital statistics, the expenditure incurred in 1889-90 for vaccination work alone amounted to Rs. 65, against Rs. 60 in 1888-89. Sibságar Station. 94. A vaccinator was employed during the season from October to March on a monthly salary of Rs. 10. He worked under the supervision of the Civil Surgeon. Altogether 400 vaccinations were performed by him, and of these, 143 operations, with 123 successful were done within the station limits, as contrasted with 162 operations with 133 successful cases in the preceding year. The municipality contributed Rs. 60, against Rs. 55 in the previous year. The Civil Surgeon advises that the law regarding vaccination should be made compulsory in this station. Shillong Station. 95. There was one vaccinator employed throughout the year. He performed 545 operations, the Civil Surgeon had 107, and the Hospital-As- sistant of the dispensary had 53 operations. There was a total of 705 operations, against 181 of the preceding year, showing a marked increase of 524 operations. Although vaccination is not compulsory here, yet the results are satisfactory. Of 673 primary operations, 183 under one year, 320 between one and six years, and 88 above six years were successful. Of 32 cases of re-vaccinations, 24 were successful. The success attending the excellent work of Dr. R. N. Campbell is gratifying and remark- able, as far as the station is concerned. The civil authorities rendered much assistance. The municipality contributed Rs. 150 annually in the year, and the actual expenditure was Rs. 147-1, against Rs. 86-9 in the preceding year. Habiganj Union. 96. A special vaccinator was employed for the first time on Rs. 10 a month under the supervision of the dispensary Hospital-Assistant, The vacci- nator received Rs. 36-14, and performed 165 operations, of which 121 were successful, and the cost of each successful case was 4 annas and 10 pie. Sixty of his operations were inspected by the Hospital-Assistant and 54 were found successful. In 1888-89, 75 operations were performed without any special agency, i.e., by the dispen- sary Hospital-Assistant. Of this number, the number of successful cases was 55. It is hoped that better results from the employment of the special vaccinator, and also from the operations of the Hospital-Assistant in addition, may be obtained in the next season. Balaganj Union. 97. There was no paid vaccinator in this union. 269 vaccinations were performed by the Hospital-Assistant and the compounder in charge of the Baláganj Dispensary; of which number, 256 were successful, as contrasted with only four operations in 1888-89. The result has been very satisfactory this year. Sunámganj Union. 98. There was no paid vaccinator employed by this union. The number of opera- tions performed during 1889-90 (by the Hospital-Assistant of the dispensary) was 359, against 147 in 1888-89, and of those 241 cases were successful, against 136 in the previous year. D
( 18 ) Jorhát Union. 99. One vaccinator was entertained from the union funds on Rs. 10 per month. The sanctioned budget grant for 1889-90 was Rs. 60. The total expenditure was Rs. 50 during the year, against Rs. 42-10-8 of the previous year. In 1889-90, 805 vaccinations were performed, of which 757, or 92.7 per cent., were successful, as contrasted with 591 operations, and 513, or 90.6 per cent., successful in 1888-89. Golághát Union. 100. Only one vaccinator was employed by the Golághát Union; he was paid for six months only, at Rs. 10 per mensem, and he performed 87 operations. The Hospital-Assistant in medical charge of the dispensary performed 13 cases. The total number of vaccinations performed during the year was 100, against 68 in the previous year, showing an increase of 32; and, of that number, the successful cases were reported to have been 88, as compared with 68 in 1888-89. The total cost of vaccination was Rs. 60 as contrasted with Rs. 55 in the preceding year. I have requested the Civil Surgeon to take care that better results are obtained in the coming season.

Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner of Assam in the General Department, No. 5,909G., dated the 30th July 1890. READ( 2 ) concerned, and he would ask the Deputy-Surgeon-General to consider whether some steps might not be taken to bring about a development of vaccination at that place by increasing the number of municipal vaccinators, or by such other measures as may appear feasible. Any prejudicial influence which may be exercised by kála azár affords a reason tor increasing rather than relaxing the efforts not only in regard to vaccination, but in regard to all sanitary measures. Paragraph 15. (Inoculation in Sylhet and Cachar ) 5. The Chief Commissioner has had under his consideration the subject of inocu- lation as practised in the Province, and will shortly apply to the Government of India for permission to bring into operation the Bengal Acts, IV. of 1865 (which prohibits inoculation) and III. of 1880 (which renders vaccination compulsory), in certain localities adjoining Bengal. The Acts in question are already in force in the adjoining Bengal districts, and their operation could be fully watched in the particular areas in Assam to which it is proposed to apply them. Paragraph 16. (Employment of licensed vaccinators.) 6. The employment of licensed vaccinators in Goálpára, as supervised by Dr. Dobson, has proved successful; but the system is open to obvious abuses, which can only be kept down by the exercise of strict control. The case referred to in paragraph 16 of the report, in which a vaccinator demanded more than the sanctioned fee (two annas), attracted the Chief Commissioner's notice when on tour at Goál pára last cold weather, and such cases, if of frequent occur- rence, would outweigh the benefits attributed to the employment of this agency. The Civil Surgeon of Shillong should be able to spare more time for the inspection of vaccina- tion operations during the cold weather, when the European population of the station is at its lowest. Paragraph 54. (Prevalence of small-pox in Nowgong.) 7. It is satisfactory to note that no epidemic of small-pox has taken place in the district of Nowgong during the last five years, while no death from small-pox has occurred during the last two years. This fact, coupled with the statistics given in the report, affords the best testimony to the value of the services of Dr. McNaught in this department, which Mr. Quinton has much pleasure in recognising. Paragraph 58. (Work done by licensed vaccinators in Sibságar) 8. The plan followed in the Sibságar district in the matter of the employment of ex-inoculators as licensed vaccinators is worthy of adoption elsewhere, when favourable conditions exist, as being likely to conciliate the people towards vaccination. Paragraphs 93-94. (Compulsory vaccination in the Silchar and Sibságar stations.) 9. The proposal to introduce the Compulsory Vaccination Act into the stations of Silchar and Sibságar should be separately submitted for the Chief Commissioner's consideration and orders. Paragraphs 95, 96, 99. and 100 of report (Results in Shillong Station and Habi- ganj, Jorhát, and Golághát Unions) 10. As observed by the Deputy-Surgeon-General, although vaccination is not compulsory in the Shillong Station, the results are satisfactory. The results obtained in the Habiganj Union by the appoint- ment of a special vaccinator are good, but a larger number of operations should have been shown. In the case of the Jorhát Union the results were especially good. As regards the Golághát Union, the sub-divisional officer will be directed to use his influence with a view to forward the cause of vaccination. 11. The extent to which small-pox prevailed in the several municipalities and stations of the Province is shown in the Annual Sanitary Report, but the Chief Com- missioner would be glad if the Deputy-Surgeon-General would be good enough in future to embody this information in the Annual Report on Vaccination, so that a judgment may readily be formed of the practical success or otherwise of vaccination work in each of the municipal areas. 12. In conclusion the Chief Commissioner desires to thank Dr. Costello for his efficient supervision of vaccination work throughout the Province during the year under report.

No. 523S. FROM DEPUTY-SURGEON-GENERAL C. P. COSTELLO, Administrative Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam, To THE SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER OF ASSAM, Shillong, the 27th July 1891, SIR, Government of India, Home Department (Public), No. 28 2 or an increase of 41,454 over the previous year, which is a great improvement. There has been a general and most gratifying increase in vaccination all through the Province in the past season, excepting in the Gáro Hills and in the Goálpára district, in each of which there was a slight falling off, as compared with the previous year. In the Sylhet district the number of operations rose from 37,274 in 1889-90 to 53,273 in 1890-91, or 15,999 in excess of the previous year, which is very satisfactory. In the Darrang district the work done increased by 5,973 over the figures of the previous year, in the Lakhimpur district by 4,706, in the Nága Hills district by 3,810, in the Kámrúp district by 3,261, in the Nowgong district by 1,931, in the Khási and Jaintia Hills district by 731, in the Cachar district by 672, and in the Sibságar district by 625 over the figures of the previous year. On tea gardens the work done was greater by 4,146 vaccinations than the figures of the previous year. TABLE No. 2.

The table above shows separately the vaccination work performed on tea gardensby Government and garden agencies. There were 16,696 vaccinations performed on tea gardens, against 9,992 in 1889-90, or an increase of 6,704 over the figures in the previous year, which is very creditable. The number of successful cases rose from 8,251 in 1889-90 to 13,387 in 1890-91, but the percentage decreased from 82.57 in 1889-90 to 80.18 in 1890-91. Of the total number of 16,696 operations performed on tea gardens, 13,363 were done by garden agencies with 10,174 successful cases, and 3,333 were performed by Government agencies with 3,213 successes.

The preceding table shows the vaccination work done in the compulsory areas under Act V of 1880 as well as in the Dibrugarh canton- ment, as compared with the work done in the past three years. The total number of operations performed increased from 1,734 in 1889-90 to 1,891 in 1890-91, and the number of successful operations from 1,439 to 1,658. This was chiefly due to the number of operations performed in the Dhubri and Goálpára munici- palities, where Act V has been made compulsory, during the year under review, and which are included in the above table. In Sylhet 250 notices were issued under the Act, but no prosecution or conviction took place, and in Gaubáti there were only ten notices issued. TABLE No. 5.

The number of licensed vaccinators' operations actually inspected during the year 1890-91 will be found in the above table. The number of operations performed by this class of operators amounted to 18,247, against 18,758 in 1889-90, or a decrease of 511 operations from the previous year. The total number of inspections were 11,215, of which 10,324 were found to be successful cases, as compared with 11,641 inspections with 10,890 successful cases in 1889-90, showing a decrease from the figures of the previous year. The percentage of successful cases actually verified by inspection also decreased from 93.55 in 1889-90 to 92.05 in 1890-91. Of the total number of vaccinations inspected by the Civil Surgeons and their subordinates, 891 were found unsuccessful, against 751 in 1889-90. So that the work done by this class of operators was not as good, all round, as in the previous year. B 2
4 Annual Statements. 9. Besides the preceding table, the Annual Statements Nos. I to IV are appended to the report. Annual Statement No. I, explana- tion of. 10. Annual Statement No. I shows the population according to the census of 1891 and particulars of vaccination in each district during the year, excluding the operations done by the dispensary staff. Annual Statement No. II, expla- nation of. 11. The Annual statement No. II gives the cost of the department in a more con- cise form, which has been explained in paragraph 3 of this report. Annual Statement No. III, expla- nation of. 12. The Annual Statement No. III shows the number of operations performed at the dispensaries by the dispensary staff. There were 10,466 operations performed by this class of operators, against 7,265 in 1889-90. Of that number, 10,406 were primary vaccinations, of which 9,010 were successful, showing a percentage of 86.58 of successful cases, as compared with 7,223 primary vaccinations, with 6,743 successful and a percentage of 93.37, in the previous year. In the Sylhet district the figures have risen from 5,845 to 7,485, or about seven-tenths of the total vaccinations performed at the dispensaries of this Province. The increase is also very marked in the Nága Hills district, the figures having risen from 15 to 947 in 1890-91. Annual Statement No. IV, expla- nation of. 13. The Annual Statement No. IV shows the number of primary vaccinations per- formed in Assam for the past nine years, as compared with the figures in 1890-91. The total number of operations performed rose from 146,336 in 1889-90 to 177,356 in 1890-91, or an increase of 31,020 over the figures of the previous year, which is a great improvement. The work done by Government vaccinators has increased from 44,929 to 62,471; by dispensary staff from 7,222 to 10,406; by Local Fund vaccinators from 62,005 to 68,757; and by tea garden agency from 9,217 to 13,363. The work done by the licensed vaccinators decreased from 18,755 to 18,234. There is also a slight decrease in the work done by the municipal vaccinators, as compared with the figures in the previous year. Remarks on the advisability of extending IV Act (B.C.) of 1880 to certain selected areas in the Surma Valley. 14. The extension of Act IV (B.C.) of 1880 to such areas in Assam as may be selected by the Chief Commissioner for the purpose of prohibiting inoculation in them, and has been approved by the Government of India, under certain restrictions, in paragraph -5 of Home Department (Sanitary) No. 1, dated the 2nd January 1891, to the Chief Com- missioner of Assam, is, I think, most desirable for certain areas in the Surma Valley districts ; but, previous to applying it to such selected areas, I am inquiring from the Civil Surgeons of the Cachar and Sylhet districts as to the places where it can be safely applied, especially with reference to the necessary condition of there- being sufficient means of vaccination open to the public before the Act in question is made applicable to the areas which may be so selected. As soon as this proviso has been complied with, I shall propose certain areas to the Chief Commissioner for the enforcement of the Act in them, and I hope that by this means inoculation, hitherto so common in certain subdivisions, notably the Habiganj subdivision of the Sylhet district, may be discontinued. Vaccination in Municipalities, Stations, and Unions. 15. In accordance with Government of India Home Department No. 746, dated the 23rd April 1889, the following information as regards vaccination in muncipalities, stations, and unions is here appended. Sylhet Municipality. 16. Vaccination was carried on in this municipality under Act XIII of 1880 (the Vaccination Act). For the efficient management of the vaccination work in this municipality, the Commissioners framed certain rules under section 19 of the said Act, which have been sanctioned by the Chief Commissioner. One vaccinator was engaged by the municipality, who performed 401 operations, of which 350 were successful. An allowance of Rs. 10 per mensem was given to the Hospital Assistant in medical charge of the Rainagar dispensary for the supervision of the town vaccination work. The expenditure under this head was Rs. 180-7-8, and the average cost per head of successful vaccination was 8 annas and 6 pies. Dhubri Municipality. 17. The Vaccination Act was only introduced at the close of the season. The municipality did not contribute anything towards vaccina- tion. The Hospital Assistant and the Inspector of Vaccina- tion performed all the vaccinations done within the municipal limits. The total number of births annually is so small that there seems no necessity for a special grant from the municipality on this account. Forty-seven vaccinations were performed, against 65 in the previous year ; of this number, 32 were successful.
5 Goálpára Municipality. 18. The Vaccination Act was introduced into this municipality about the beginning of the season. The municipality did not contribute anything towards vaccination. The work was carried on by the Hospital Assistant in medical charge of the dispensary and by a licensed vaccinator, as in the previous year. There were 47 operations performed during the year, against 95 in the previous year ; of that number, 45 were successful. Gauháti Municipality. 19. Five hundred and eight operations were performed during the year, against 541 in the previous year ; of that number, 444 were successful. The permanent municipal vaccinator performed 419 primary vaccinations, of which 362 were successful. Ten notices were issued to the parents who refused to allow their children to be vaccinated. The total expenditure on vaccination was Rs. 180. Barpeta Municipality. 20. The municipality did not contribute anything towards vaccination. The people will not accept vaccination, on account of religious bigotry, until it is made compulsory. There have been 10 children vaccinated by the Hospital Assistant, of whom 9 were successful, against 82 with 51 successful cases in 1889-90. The Vaccination Act, V of 1880, is not compulsory in this municipality. Dibrugarh Municipality 21. Vaccination is compulsory within the municipal area. The population within the municipality is well protected. One temporary vaccina- tor on Rs. 12 per month for six months was employed. He performed 693 primary operations, of which 640 were successful, against 626 with 504 successful cases in the previous year. The total expenditure on vaccination was Rs. 72, and the average cost of each successful operation was 1 anna 8 pies. Silchar Station. 22. Vaccination is not compulsory within the station. One vaccinator was employed on Rs. 5 per month throughout the year from April 1890 to March 1891. 239 primary operations were performed, of which number only 142 children were vaccinated within the limits of the station, and the remaining 117 were done in the villages near the station. The number of successful cases was 223. The average cost of each successful case was 3 annas and 11 pies. No Progress can be expected unless vaccination is made compulsory by law. Sibságar Station. 23. The law against inoculation is enforced in the station. The people appreciate vaccination. The station pays Rs. 10 monthly during the season for a vaccinator. He was employed from October to March, and performed 518 operations, of which 481 were successful. The average cost of each successful case was 2 annas. Shillong Station 24. Vaccination is carried on in this station under the supervision of the Civil Surgeon. The permanent vaccinator was found on one occasion to record fictitious cases. He was therefore fined one month's pay and was dismissed. A new man has been appointed in his place, who is doing good work. Four hundred and nineteen operations were performed during the year, of which 366 were successful. The Civil Surgeon had 22 successful cases out of 23 opera- tions, and the Hospital Assistant in charge of the animal vaccination depôt and the Hospital Assistant in subordinate medical charge of the Shillong dispensary performed 49 vaccinations, all of which were successful. It should be noted here that the Shillong vaccinations were generally performed with animal lymph. The total expenditure on vaccination was Rs. 126-3-3 out of a grant of Rs. 150. The average cost of each successful case was 5 annas 6 pies. This high rate for successful cases was due to the indifferent vaccinator, who was discharged for his false returns as above noted. Habiganj Union. 25. The report says that it was at first intended to employ the Hospital Assistant of the coolie depôt (who has spare time) this year, to avoid the cost of employing a ganak. The Hospital Assistant, however, fell sick and took sick leave at the beginning of the vaccination season, and a ganak vaccinator was employed on Rs. 10 per mensem from 3rd December 1890 to 31st March 1891 to vaccinate within the limits of the union under the supervision of the Local Board Inspector of Vaccination. There were 104 operations performed by this vaccinator, including 25 cases performed by the Inspector of Vaccination, against 165 in the previous year. Of that number, 71 were successful, inclusive of 21 successful cases of the Inspector, against 165 operations with 121 successful cases in the last year. The total expenditure on vaccination was Rs. 40. The sooner Act V is introduced here the better. I am recommending to the Chief Commissioner that this union be directed to engage a really good vaccinator with the advice of the Civil Surgeon. Balaganj Union 26. There was no paid vaccinator in this union. The Hospital Assistant and the com- pounder performed only three operations, of which two were successful and one unsuccessful, which is not satisfactory. There was no expenditure on vaccination during the year. There is no longer a regular
6 union here, so I recommend that the Local Board be directed to engage a good vaccinator and I am submitting a letter to the Chief Commissioner to this effect. Sunámganj Union. 27. There was no paid vaccinator employed in this union. The compounder attached to the Sunámganj dispensary was paid Rs. 2 monthly for four months for performing vaccination operations within the limits of the union. -He performed 51 operations, and the Hospital Assistant, in addition to inspecting these cases, performed 24 operations, total 75, against 359 operations in the previous year. There ought to be a vaccinator here also,7 directed by the Government of India letter (Home Department8 APPENDIX A. Annual Report of the Animal Vaccination Depôt for the year 1890-91. Expenditure. The total expenditure since the establishment of the depôt, viz., 13th January 1890, up to 31st March 1891, was Rs. 5,671-13-11, out of which Rs. 440-7-1 were expended in the financial year 1889-90 and Rs. 5,231-6-10 in 1890-91. A statement showing the expenditure on different heads and a cash statement are attached herewith. Purchase and repair of building. 2. A building was purchased for Rs. 350, and Rs. 302-2-6 was expended for repairing the building and constructing new cow stalls and a fireplace with chimney. The total expenditure on this head was Rs. 652-2-6, out of which Rs. 300 were expended in the year 1889-90 and Rs. 352-2-6 in 1890-91. Animals. 3. Three goats were purchased for Rs. 4-11, to see whether they could be vaccinated as successfully as calves, but the experiment proved a failure. One died, and the remaining two were sold for Rs. 2-12. The net cost was Re. 1-15. 467 calves were purchased at a net expenditure of Rs. 2,452, i.e., 467 calves were bought at Rs. 7 each = Rs. 3,926. Rs. 817 were realised by the sale of calves, which leaves a net cost, under this head, of Rs. 2,452. A contractor was engaged almost throughout the year, who supplied calves at Rs. 7 each, out of which amount he returned Rs. 3 when he got back the calf. Only 19 calves were disposed of by private sale for Rs. 64. Out of 467 calves, 187 died, 270 were sold or returned, and 10 remained in hand on the 1st April 1891. 4. A statement showing deaths of calves in different stages month by month is attached herewith, which will at once show that excessive cold is the sole cause of mortality. The number of deaths among the protected calves is much greater than the unprotected, as the former, being weak, could not endure excessive cold. Again, January and February were the months of the greatest number of deaths. The total expenditure under the head &quot; Animals&quot; was Rs. 2,453-15. Feeding of animals. 5. Rs. 199-10-6 were expended for purchasing rice, calm, grass, and salt for feeding calves. Miscellaneous 6. The total expenditure on this head was Rs. 1,229-15-9, out of which Rs. 871-4 were expended for 124,000 empty capillary vaccine tubes, Rs. 42 for service stamps and postcards, and the remaining Rs. 316-11-9 for purchasing instruments, furniture, packing boxes, rope, candles, wax, &c. Establishment. 7. The establishment consists of one second-grade Hospital Assistant, three coolies, and one sweeper. The Hospital Assistant gets Rs. 53-12, each coolie Rs. 9, and sweeper Rs. 12 per month. Only one coolie was appointed in the beginning of the year, and the remaining were appointed subsequently as the work increased. The total pay drawn by coolies and sweeper was Rs. 350-11-1, and the Hospital Assistants' pay amounted to Rs. 785-7-1, out of which he drew Rs. 140-7-1 in 1889-90 and Rs. 645 in 1890-91. The total expenditure under the head Establishment was Rs. 1,136-2-2, viz., Rs. 140-7-1 in 1889-90 and 995-11-1 in 1890-91. Vaccination. 8. 412 calves were vaccinated during the year, out of which 40 died in stall, so lymph could not be obtained from them, and lymph obtained from 11 calves was solely used in mixing with lanoline for experiment. 118,486 tubes were loaded from the lymph obtained from the remaining 361 calves. So the average quantity of lymph gathered from each calf was 328.21 tubes. Distribution 9. 112,475 tubes of lymph were distributed to the Civil Surgeons of Assam, and the remaining 6,011 tubes of lymph have been used in vaccinating calves (some of the first loaded had to be destroyed). In the beginning of the vaccination season 3,000 tubes were supplied weekly to all the districts of Assam, but the supply was increased by and by according to demand to 5,170, in addition to the extra supply to the various regiments and contingent supplies. There was no breach of regular supply except on one or two occasions for a day or two, which was caused by the want of empty tubes in hand. This was caused again by the sudden demand of increased supply by various Civil Surgeons, and to the Calcutta market not being able to supply the necessary number of tubes. Quality. 10. Fifty-six children were vaccinated in the depôt in order to see the efficacy of calf lymph, and all except one were successful. In addition to that, it was tried by the Medical Officer, 43rd Gurkha Light Infantry, who used it upon six men and three children, and reported that vaccination had been successful in all the cases. The Civil Surgeon, Kohima, reported by wire &quot; vaccination very successful.&quot; This lymph is No. H2 which was returned by the Civil Surgeon, Dhubri, as unsafe to be used. Probably he returned the lymph without seeing the result obtained from its use. Surgeon Major S. Borah reported on the 31st March 1891 that &quot;so far the lymph proved very successful, but from the latter part of the current month (March) it is not so good, which may be attributed to the heat of the weather.&quot; The Officiating Civil Surgeon of Sylhet, Dr. Partridge, reported9 Protective power. 11. Opinions were asked by this office from all the Civil Surgeons of Assam, who responded to the call. The Civil Surgeons of Gauháti, Nowgong, Cachar, Nága Hills, Darrang, and Sylhet have reported that in their opinion the calf lymph has probably the same protective power as human lymph. The Civil Surgeon of Lakhimpur is of opinion that a sufficient time has not elapsed since the introduction of calf lymph in this Province to enable him to judge of the protective power of animal lymph. The Civil Surgeon of Tura is not ready to pass any opinion of the protective power in the absence of any epidemic of small- pox. Personally I am of opinion that the calf lymph has the same protective power as human lymph, but this can only be made certain during an epidemic of small-pox. 12.

COSTELLO, Administrative Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam, To THE SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER OF ASSAM. Shillong, the 27th May 1892. SIR, In accordance with the instructions contained in Government of India, Home Department letter No. 282 Explanation of annual statement No. IV. 7. Annual statement No. IV exhibits the number of primary vaccinations performed in Assam during the past ten years. The total number of operations increased from 177,356 in 1890-91 to 197,572 in 1891-92, and the successful cases from 161,625 to 184,225. The work of the Local Board vaccinators increased by 13,488 cases, of the dispensary staff by 6,452, and of the licensed vaccinators by 4,369; but the operations done by the Government vaccinators decreased by 8,109, which was mainly due to the unsatisfactory work done in the Kámrúp district, as is explained in paragraphs 8 and 9 of the report given below, and to the opposition of villagers where vaccination is not compulsory, to the prevalence of inoculation in some Sylhet subdivisions, as well as to some necessary changes of districts amongst the Civil Surgeons during the year, causing a few districts to be for short intervals in the charge of a Medical Subordinate only.

The above table gives the grand total of vaccine operations of all kinds (compulsory and non-compulsory) during the past year, and exhibits the increase or decrease in the number of vaccinations in each district as performed by all classes of operators in comparison with the work done in the preceding year. 206,331 persons were vaccinated during the year, against 187,110 in the previous year, showing an actual increase of 19,221 operations. There was an increase of vaccination work in all the districts of the province excepting in Kámrúp, Darrang, and Sylhet, which districts, in the order given, show a falling off. In the Nága Hills district the operations were increased by 10,430 over the figures of the previous year, in the Goálpára district by 4,117, in the Nowgong district by 2,902, in the Cachar district by 1,324, in the Lakhimpur district by 1,226, in the Sibságar district by 996, in the Khási and Jaintia Hills district by 658, and in the Gáro Hills district by 430. In Manipur 7,481 vaccinations were performed against nil in the previous year, which is very gratifying; and the Political Agent hopes, in time, to-have all the people of that State protected against small-pox. The work has been very unsatisfactory in the Kámrúp district from want of proper supervision on the part of the Civil Surgeon (Dr. Macleod), who was in charge of the district during the greater part of the season. In the Kámrúp district alone there was a decrease of 4,217 operations, in the Darrang district of 1,869, and in the Sylhet district of 123 operations, which last is a comparatively slight decrease. Surgeon-Major Borah, the Civil Surgeon of the Darrang district, should show better and more satisfactory results in the ensuing season. On tea gardens the work done was less by 4,134 vaccinations than in the preceding year, and the cause of the falling off will be found under paragraph 10 of this report.

4 Inspection of vaccinations. 9. The above table shows the number of vaccinations actually inspected by the Civil Surgeons, hospital assistants, &c., and native in- spectors. Out of a total of 206,331 vaccinations in the province, 101,197 cases, or more than half, were actually inspected, against 187,110 and 98,612 respectively in the previous year. Of the 101,197 cases verified, 92,978, or 91.88 per cent., were found successful as compared with 89,575, or 90.83 per cent., in the preceding year. The Civil Surgeon of the Goálpára district inspected 3,591 cases5 Vaccination on tea gardens. 10. The preceding table shows the vaccination work performed on tea gardens by the garden agency as well as by the Government agency. A grand total of 11,219 vaccinations were performed, against 16,696 in 1890-91 and 9,992 in 1889-90. The decrease is due to much less work of this description having been done in the tea gardens of all the districts, with the exception of Nowgong and Lakhimpur. In the Darrang and Sylhet districts, the decrease was most remarkable. The grand total increase in the Lakhimpur district was due to the vaccina- tions by garden agency having risen from 1,102 in 1890-91 to 1,520 in the past year. In this district there was, however, a decrease of operations under Government agency. The number of successful cases decreased from 13,387, or 80.18 per cent., in 1890-91, to 9,285, or 82.76 per cent., in 1891-92. The percentage of successful cases in the Sylhet district continues to be very low, although there was a slight improvement over the figures of the previous year. The general low percentage of success in gardens is attributed to lymph having been used by the garden agencies after it had been kept for a long time, so that it had become inert and useless, and no doubt it is often due to vaccination being carelessly performed and inspected. Of the total number of 11,219 operations performed on tea gardens, 9,229 were done by garden agencies, with 7,430 successful cases, and 1,990 were performed by the public vaccinators, &c., with 1,855 successes.

The result of inspection of the licensed vaccinators' work is given in the above table. The total number of operations performed by this class of operators came to 22,788 in 1891-92, against 18,247 in 1890-91. Of that number, 12,032 cases, or more than half, were verified by inspection. The inspection was very satisfactory at Goálpára, and least satisfactory at Kámrúp, where out of 4,462 operations only 732 were verified by the native inspector and none by the Civil Surgeon. The percentages of successful cases, as reported by the licensed vaccinators, were at Goálpára 95.17, Kámrúp 95.99, and Sibságar 95.14; but the result was found on inspection by the native inspectors to be 85.43, 86.47, and 94.12 per cent., respectively, in those three districts. Licensed vaccinators were not employed in any other district. Of the total number of 12,032 inspections, 10,493, or 87.21 per cent., were successful, against a total of 11,215, with 10,324 or 92.05 per cent. successful in the previous year. VACCINATION IN MUNICIPALITIES, STATIONS, AND UNIONS. 13. In accordance with the Government of India, Home Department letter No. 746, dated the 23rd April 1889, and with the Secretary to the Chief Commissioner's letter No. 3906G., dated 5th. May 1892, the following information regarding vaccination in municipalities, stations, and unions is given separately: Sylhet Municipality. 14. Vaccination has been compulsory in this municipality since 1st October 1882. Within the municipal limits 358 vaccinations were performed during the year, of which 335 were successful. In the previous year there were 401 operations and 356 successful cases, or in the past year a percentage of success equal to 93.57 as compared with 88.78 in the previous year. The causes of the decrease in the number of vaccinations were (a) a smaller number of births in 1891-92 than in 1890-91, (b) much more sickness among children than in the previous year, which prevented their being vaccinated. 280 notices were issued during 1891-92 under the Compulsory Vaccination Act. There were 7 prose- cutions, but no punishments were awarded, as all the persons so prosecuted were merely warned by the magistrate. One vaccinator was engaged by the municipality at Rs. 10 a month for a period of five and a half months, i.e., during the vaccination season. Besides a total expenditure of Rs. 55-2-6 on account of pay of this vaccinator, the municipality paid Rs. 60 for the supervision and inspection work which was done by the Hospital Assistant in medical -charge of the Rainagar Municipal Dispensary. All the cases done within the municipal area were inspected, and the percentage of successful cases as reported by the vaccinator was found correct. The total expenditure on vaccination was Rs. 115-2-6, and the average cost of each successful case was 5 annas and 6 pies in 1891-92 as contrasted with Rs. 180-7-8 and 8 annas and 6 pies respectively in 1890-91.
7 Dhubri Municipality. 15. Vaccination was made compulsory within this municipality from the 13th February 1891, but the rules under section 19 of Act XIII of 1880 were not introduced until the 10th February 1892. The municipality did not contribute anything towards vaccination, as it was not required to do so and as the Dhubri Dispensary Hospital Assistant performed all the vaccinations procurable within the municipal limits. He performed 59 operations with 56 successful cases, against 47 and 42, respectively, in the previous year. The total number of births registered during the year 1891 was 47, against 62 in 1890. It is reported that the total number of births annually within the municipal area is so small that at present there seems no necessity for a special grant for vaccination within this municipality. Goálpára Municipality. 16. During the year under review 193 vaccinations were performed in this municipality, of which 188 proved successful, against 47 operations and 45 successful cases in the preceding year. All the vaccination work was done by the Hospital Assistant in charge of the dispensary. No separate vaccinator was employed for this municipality, in which 136 births were registered during the year 1891. It was not necessary for the municipality to contribute anything towards vaccination. Gauháti Municipality. 17. During the year 1891-92, 702 vaccinations were performed in this munici- pality, of which 587 proved successful, against a total of 508 operations and 444 successful cases in 1890-91. Of the 702 operations, the municipal vaccinator performed 659 and the Hospital Assistant performed 43 cases. The municipality employed a vaccinator who was retained throughout the year at a monthly salary of Rs. 15. He received a total of Rs. 180 during the year and performed 544 successful cases, the average cost of each successful case having come to 5 annas and 4 pies. 28 notices were issued by the Civil Surgeon; and one person who failed to comply with the notice was prosecuted, who, however, afterwards complied with the provisions of the Act. Barpeta Municipality. 18. Vaccination is not compulsory in this municipality. No satisfactory work can be expected here until the Compulsory Vaccination Act is introduced. 53 children were vaccinated within the municipal limits during the year under report, of which 18 were vaccinated by the Hospital Assistant in charge of the dispensary, and the remaining were vaccinated by the Local Board vaccinator. Of the 53 children vaccinated, 50 were reported as- successful and 3 unsuccessful, against 10 operations and 9 successful cases in 1890-91. The births in this municipality in the past year amounted to 417. 53 vaccinations out of that number and of those (361) born in the previous year is a very insignificant propor- tion. I am asking the Civil Surgeon to impress on the subdivisional officer, &c., the neces- sity for a greater number of vaccinations, but very much improvement cannot be obtained until vaccination has been made compulsory, which I fear will be difficult, owing to the intense bigotry in this respect of the people. The municipality contributed nothing towards vaccination. Dibrugarh Municipality. 19. A total of 751 persons were vaccinated during the year against 731 in the previous year. Of those, 725 proved successful and 26 unsuccessful, against 681 and 50 respectively in the previous year. The number of births registered in this municipality during the year 1891 was 352. There were 7 prosecutions against 7 persons for not giving information of births, in which 4 persons were convicted; but there was no prosecution during the year under the Vaccination Act. The total expenditure on vaccination was Rs. 72 in 1891-92. Silchar Station. 20. Vaccination has been made compulsory in this station from 21st January 1892, and from the 7th April 1892 inoculation also has been prohibited by law. During the year under report a total of 185 operations were performed by the municipal vaccinator, of which 175 were primary and 10 re-vaccinations ; 169 of the former and 7 of the latter proved successful, against. a total of 142 vaccinations in 1890-91 within the limits of the station as at present defined. One vaccinator was paid at Rs. 5 a month for vaccination work in addi- tion to Rs. 10 as registrar of vital statistics from 1st April 1891 to 31st March 1892. I have submitted to the Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam by my No. 666S., dated the 23rd May 1892, a recommendation based on that of the Vice-Chairman, Babu Harkisor Gupta, that the station limits, as at present defined under the operation of Act V (B.C.) of 1880 and Act IV (B.C.) of 1865, may be extended :8 Sibságar Station. 21. The Compulsory Vaccination Act came into force in this station from 21st January 1892. A total of 257 operations, with 228 successful cases, were performed during the year, of which 145, with 130 successes, were within the station limits. In 1890-91, 518 operations, with 481 successful cases, were accomplished. The station paid Rs. 60 for a vaccinator, who was employed for six months. The average cost of each successful case was 4 annas and 2 pies. Shillong Station. 22. There-was one vaccinator throughout the year. He performed 465 operations with 434 successful cases, against 419 and 366, respectively, in the previous year. His work was inspected by the Civil Surgeon and the Hospital Assistant of the Vaccination Depôt. The total number of vaccinations performed within the station limits was 560 primary vaccinations and 8 re-vaccinations; of the former 525 and of the latter 3 were successful. The Civil Surgeon had 20 successful cases out of 22 primary vaccinations performed by himself. He also had 3 successful cases out of 8 re-vaccinations. The Hospital Assistant in charge of the Vaccine Depôt vaccinated 41, all successful; and the Hospital Assistant in charge of the dispensary vaccinated 31, with 30 successful cases. The cost to the municipality was Rs. 144-2. Habiganj Union. 23. A vaccinator was employed for this union for a period of 3 months and 29 days at Rs. 10 a month. He performed 95 operations during the year 1891-92, of which 71 were reported as successful. All his operations were verified by the native inspector who found the results to correspond with those furnished by the vaccinator. In 1890-91, 104 operations and 71 successful cases were performed in this union, of which 25 and 21, respectively, were done by the native inspector. Had the vaccination work been carried on for the full season in 1891-92, a larger number of children would have been vaccinated. I have issued directions to the Civil Surgeon of Sylhet to endeavour to have the number of vaccinations increased here. There were 105 births here in the past year as compared with 93 in the previous year. Vaccination is not compulsory in this union. Balaganj. 24. In accordance with my recommendation, as stated in paragraph 26 of the last year's Report, a separate vaccinator was engaged for Balaganj on a monthly salary of Rs. 10 from the 25th November 1891 to 31st March 1892. He did 380 cases, of which 321 were successful, against 3 cases done in the previous year by the Hospital Assistant and the compounder. The total expenditure on vaccination was Rs. 32, and the average cost of each succcessful case was 1 anna and 7 pies. The unions at Balaganj and Sunámganj were abolished during the year, hence statistics for Sunámgani have not been furnished separately. Golághát Union. 25. One vaccinator was employed by the union, as in the previous year, who during the six months forming the season performed 176 vaccinations with 170 successful cases within the union limits, as contrasted with 147 and 145 respectively of the preceding year. Of the 176 operations, 130 were performed by the vaccinator and 46 by the Hospital Assistant in charge of the dispensary. Besides these, the vaccinator performed 398 operations outside the union limits. The Compulsory Vaccination Act, V (B.C.) of 1880, was intro- duced into the union with effect from the 24th March 1892. Jorhát Union. 26. One vaccinator was entertained from the union funds on a monthly salary of Rs. 10, and the total expenditure for the year was Rs. 60, which was equal to the sum expended in the previous year. A total of 691 vaccinations, with 644 successful cases, were performed by him during the year, against 640 and 622 respectively in the preceding year. Of the 691 vaccinations, 232 cases, with 229 successes, were done within the union limits, and the balance beyond the limits of the union. Under Assam Gazette Notification No. 2955G. of the 12th April 1892, Act V (B.C.) of 1880 (the Bengal Vaccination Act, 1880) was extended to the whole of this union from the 12th April 1892, and the results cannot be shown until at the end of the next year. Remarks on the working of the animal lymph depôt at Shillong. 27. The working, cost, &c., or the animal lymph depôt is fully shown in Surgeon- Major Campbell's report in Appendix A. The success of this lymph in the past year has been very satisfactory, and even more so than in the previous year (see paragraph 7 above). 223,185 tubes were distributed, as compared with 111,475 in the previous year, or an increase of 111,710 tubes so distributed to the different districts, gardens, &c., including the Manipur State. The outbreaks of small-pox in the Nága Hills and in the Manipur State caused a considerable proportion of the greater expenditure of lymph, the quality of which
9 was found to be excellent in both districts, affording striking and gratifying results in staying the progress of the epidemic in Manipur and the Nága Hills, and also at least in stamping it out for the time by its protective power. I am sorry to say, however, that just lately another epidemic has occurred at Manipur, which is being combated by renewed vaccinations of the unprotected in that State. The expenditure is carefully supervised by Dr. Campbell, whose management has been in every way a great success in the past year, even more so than in the previous year, considering the great increase in the number of tubes sent out, the quality and success of the lymph, and the proportional moderate outlay incurred. The further report on lanoline as a preservative of the quality of this lymph cannot be furnished until October at soonest, owing to the great amount of work in the past season, the success of glycerine lymph, and also to fresh lanoline having been only lately received from England. Dr. Campbell has, however, already commenced his experiments with it, and his report shall be submitted as soon as possible. Up to the present, glycerine has proved most satisfactory in this respect, and this glycerine lymph leaves nothing to be desired, so great has been its success generally, at least 90 per cent. Dr. Campbell brings prominently to notice the good services of second-grade Hospital Assistant Pratab Chandra Bose, in subordinate charge of the depôt. I cannot speak too highly of Dr Campbell's own services, which have been of the highest value and deserving the commendation of the Chief Commissioner. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient Servant, CHARLES P. COSTELLO, Surgeon-Colonel, Administrative Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam.
APPENDICES. Annual Report of the Bovine Vaccine Depot at Shillong for the year 1892
13 APPENDIX A. Annual Report of the Bovine Vaccine Depot at Shillong for the year 1892. Expenditure. The total expenditure during the year was Rs. 7,712-2-8, which includes a sum of Rs. 297-5-1 on account of Manipur, so that the actual cost to Government was Rs.7,414-13-7. A statement showing the expenditure under the various heads is herewith attached. Repairs of buildings. 2. This includes the erection of a new building, with stalls, which was used entirely for calves while vaccinated. The Hospital Assistant's quarters, operation room, and office were re-roofed with corrugated iron. The floors of the office, operation room, and both houses, with calves' stalls, were cemented. A chimney was erected in the quarters of the Hospital Assistant. The outhouses were re-thatched. 3. The total cost was Rs. 1,422-2, of which Rs. 1,300 was for new and original works and Rs. 122-2 for repairs. Animals. 4. During the year 590 calves were purchased at a net cost of Rs. 2,693-8, of which sum Manipur is debited with Rs. 135, so that the actual cost is Rs. 2,558-8. A contractor supplied the calves during the year. He was paid Rs. 7 for each calf supplied. The calves were resold to him, after lymph had been taken, for Rs. 3 each for the greater part of the year, but during the latter part of the season for Rs. 2-8 only, as he suffered considerable loss from having so many calves when forage was scanty. 5. The number of calves used during the year is as follows : UNPROTECTED CALVES.

A statement showing the mortality month by month amongst the calves is attached. It will be seen that February and March are the most fatal months. The chief cause is the scarcity and dryness of the fodder. A quantity of green food is purchased for them, but of course while out with the shepherd pasturing they eat a quantity of hard dry fodder, which causes a form of gastro-enteritis or stoppage of the bowels. This was counteracted as much as possible by giving green food as much as possible, by a plentiful supply of water and soft food, rice, and matikalai and by treatment. The deaths as compared with last year are14 7. The total expenditure, net,under the head ' Animals' is Rs. 2,558-8 + Rs. 135 for Manipur, total Rs. 2,693-8, compared with Rs. 2,453-15 in 1890-91, which is a very small increase. 8. The increase would have been much greater, of course, if the death-rate had been equal in the two years. The expenditure would really have been less if credit were taken for the calves in hand at the end of the year 1891-92, i.e., 40 calves unprotected at Rs. 7 equals Rs. 280, and five calves protected, Rs. 3, equals Rs. 15, or total of Rs. 295, which might be deducted, whereas in 1890-91 the balance in hand was 9 calves unprotected at Rs. 7 = Rs. 63, and one protected at Rs. 3 = Rs. 3, total Rs. 66, so that the net expenditure might be stated as follows : Rs. a. p. 1890-91 ... ... ... 2,387 15 0 1891-92, including Manipur ... ... 2,398 8 0 1891-92, excluding 15 very satisfactory. As tested at the depôt and in Shillong, results were also satisfactory. Fifty-three children were vaccinated in the depôt or by the depôt authorities, all successful. Experiments were made with lymph kept in stock at various times, and found successful and just as satisfactory 47, 59, 97, and 109 days after loading as when just loaded. The Political Agent, Manipur, reports he has received his supply regularly, and the quality has been good. Revd. Clark, the Missionary at Mokokchang, reports very satisfactory results: of 289 vaccina- tions, quite 280 were successful. He says the development was very fine in most cases. Dr. Gillespie, the planters' doctor at Addabari, Darrang, says the fortnightly supply has been of most excellent quality, giving the most satisfactory results. He afterwards got a weekly supply. Surgeon-Major Macnamara stated to me verbally he had seldom had a failure, and the vaccina- tors averaged well over 90 per cent. successful, and this was in Sylhet, to which district 2,000 tubes were sent weekly. Surgeon-Captain Dobson of Dhubri also informed me that the supply was of very good quality. Lanoline lymph 17. No experiments were made with lanoline during the season, as it required all the time of the depôt establishment to carry on the routine work of loading tubes with glycerine lymph. A fresh supply of lanoline has been received from England from Ferris & Co., and already I have started manufacturing lanoline lymph, and will send a report on it and the comparative results compared with glycerine tube lymph in October, as experiments can be fully carried out during the non-working season. As glycerine lymph in tubes has proved so successful, it would be a mistake at present to change to lanoline, unless it can be proved more successful, easier of manufacture, keeps better, and as practicable for general use. General remarks. 18. One of the drawbacks to this depôt was the want of a proper water-supply, as water had to be brought from the foot of the hill some little way off, and this was a hardship, as the quantity of water required for flushing and cleaning out the two calves' sheds and the operation room was considerable. The Government of Assam has sanctioned Rs. 400 to build a masonry tank and supply water to the depôt for the ensuing year, which will be a great improvement. 19. The Hospital Assistant in charge, second-grade Hospital-Assistant Pratab Chandra Bose, has worked zealously, and I hope the Government of Assam will see its way to allowing the extra grant proposed by the Deputy Surgeon General, as this special work requires a skilful and zealous worker, and can only be a success if he is careful and attentive to his duties. 20. The work has increased very much this year, as may be seen from the increase in the number of tubes distributed, i.e.,16 Showing the Cash Account of Animals of Vaccination Depôt during the year 1891-92: RECEIPTS EXPENDITURE.

ArmyResolution on the Vaccination Report for 1891-92. Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner of Assam in the General Depart- ment, No. 5950 G., dated the 11th July 1892. Read2 letter No. 329, dated the 30th September 1891, reviewing the Vaccination Report of Assam for the year 1890-91, reference was made to the falling off in the number of operations performed in compulsory areas in the Sylhet district, and it was remarked that this falling off was especially to be regretted in view of the fact that inoculation appears to be commonly practised in that district. As regards this, it may be mentioned that Act IV (B.C.) of 1865 (an Act for the prohibition of the practice of inoculation) was extended in April 1892 to the towns of Sylhet, Karirnganj, Sunámganj, Habiganj, Maulvi Bázár, Hailákándi, and Silchar in the Surina Valley. The working of the Act and its effect on vaccine opera- tions will be noticed in the report for 1892-93. Besides the extension noted above, Act V (B.C.) of 1880 was introduced into the stations of Silchar and Sibságar and the Union of Golághát during the year under report, and it has been introduced also into the Jorhat Union since the close of the year. In the Dhubri Municipality, although Act XIII of 1880 (the Vaccination Act) was extended in February 1891, the rules under the Act were introduced only in February 1892. Working of the animal lymph depôt at Shillong. 5. The Chief Commissioner is glad to notice that the success of the Shillong lymph depôt is now assured, a result which is largely due to the able management of the depôt by Surgeon- Major R. N. Campbell. By order of the Chief Commissioner of Assam, F. C. DAUKES, Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam. A S P O (Report) No 15-200-11-7-92

No. 503S FROM SURGEON-COLONEL C. P. COSTELLO, Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam, To THE SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER OF ASSAM. Shillong, the 15th May 1893. SIR, Government of India, Home De- partment (Public) Nos. 282 38,878 were performed on infants under one year of age and 110,982 on children over one and under six years of age. as compared with 20,947 and 111,160 respectively in 1891-92. Remarks on Annual Statement No. II. 5. The annual statement No. II shows the cost of the establishment of the department in the past year as well as the amount expended from different sources and the average cost of each successful case. The total cost of the department on account of vaccinations was Rs. 17,701-5-2 during the year 1892-93 as compared with Rs. 15,993-0-3 in 1891-92, or an increase of Rs. 1,708-4-11 over the expenditure in the previous year. Out of the amount so expended in the past year, Rs. 7,238-8-1 were paid from Provincial Funds, Rs. 8,922-0-1 by Local Boards, and Rs. 760-13 by Municipalities, as well as Rs. 780 by the Manipur State, against Rs. 6,676-4-4, Rs. 8,215-11-8, Rs. 822-10-3, and Rs. 278-6 respectively in 1891-92. The average cost of each successful case was 1 anna 61/3 pies in 1892-93 as compared with 1 anna 6¾ pies in 1891-92, and 1 anna 9 pies in 1890-91. During the year under report the cost of each successful operation ranged from 4½ pies, the lowest, in the Goálpára district, to 5 annas 5 pies, the highest, in the Khási and Jaintia Hills district. Remarks on Annual Statement No. III. 6. The annual statement No. III shows the number of operations performed at the several dispensaries in the province during the year 1892-93 by Civil Surgeons, Assistant Surgeons, Hospital Assistants, and compounders, with their results. They performed a total of 11,161 vaccinations in 1892-93 against 16,936 in 1891-92, and 10,466 in 1890-91. The number of primary successful cases was 9,010 in 1890-91,15,440 in 1891-92, and 10,982 in 1892-93, and the percentages of successful cases were 86.58, 91.59, and 81.72 respectively in those three years. Darrang, Cachar, Kámrúp, and Goálpára gave the most satisfactory results in the past year, in the order given. A good part of the increase (675) over the previous year in Cachar was due to 333 persons, of the classes known as Cacharis, Nágas, Kukis, and Mikirs, having been vaccinated in the Gunjong Dispensary, against 27 and 7 in the two previous seasons, when Mikirs only submitted to vaccination. Mr. Baker, the subdivisional officer at Gunjong, hopes to succeed in having at least 1,000 Nágas, &c., vaccinated in the ensuing season. Much credit is due to third-grade Hospital Assistant Bishnu Charan Banerji for the above mentioned successful results in the Gunjong; Dispensary. Remarks on Annual Statement No. IV. 7. The annual statement No. IV shows the number of primary vaccinations performed and the number successfully vaccinated in the Province during the past ten years. It will be seen that the total number of operations performed increased from 88,123 in 1883-84 to 214,110 in 1892-93, and the successful cases from 76,368 to 199,081 in those years. TABLE No. 1.

The above table No. 1 shows the vaccination work done in each district and on tea estates in each of the past three years, and also compares the numbers of the operations of each year with those of the succeeding year, showing the differences between them, as well as offering a comparison of the results of the past with those of the previous year. During the triennial period which has just terminated the yearly number of opera- tions has increased from 146,506 vaccinations in the season 1889-90 to 224,943 in the season ending on 31st March of the current year, or an increase of 78,437 vaccinations as compared with 17,673, the corresponding increase for the previous triennial period, which is a considerable and satisfactory improvement. This increase has been very steady and continuous, although in the past year it has not been as high as in the previous year, which is explained by vaccinations in the Nága Hills having aggregated 14,275 in 1891-92, an increase of 10,430 over the figures of 1890-91, owing to the reasons given in paragraph 9 below, and also to Manipur having increased the numbers of the previous year (1891-92) by 7,481 over those of the year 1890 91, a considerable and most exceptional increase, owing to the special circumstances of the inclusion of the returns from Manipur for the first time in the body of last year's report and also to a widespread epidemic of small-pox having so alarmed the people of Manipur that they willingly submitted to vaccination, and even sought for it. Sylhet shows (see the figures for the past year) the greatest increase (23,773) over the figures of 1889-90, Kámrúp, Manipur, Darrang, Nága Hills, Nowgong, Lakhimpur, Cachar, Goálpára, and tea gardens show the next highest figures in the order given. The large increase in the Sylhet district is very creditable to the Civil Surgeons and the civil authorities concerned. The increase was first very noticeable in the year 1890-91, and is referred to in paragraph 4 of the Provincial Annual Vaccination Report for that year. During each year of the triennial period, and commencing after 1888-89, the increases in this district were continuous, except in 1891-92, and very remarkable, and I may mention that Surgeon- Captain S. H. Henderson, Dr. Partridge, Surgeons-Major J. W. Macnamara, and H. C. Banerji were, in turn, in medical charge of this district during the triennial period under review. It will be seen from the above that the good progress noted was effected chiefly during the incumbencies of Drs. S. H. Henderson, Partridge, and Banerji. Dr. Macnamara was on furlough from 2nd October 1889 to 11th October 1891, and remained in charge until 1st March 1892, during which latter period there was a decrease of 123 as compared with the corresponding period in 1890-91. The reason of the increase in Manipur has been given above. The increase in the Kámrúp district is very satisfactory. The increase in the Nága Hills district from 88 in 1888-89 to 14,275 in 1891-92, even with the comparatively reduced figures 7,110 for the past year, is, relatively to the popu- lation, the most satisfactory of the remaining districts. In the Khási and Jaintia Hills the increase in the triennial period only came to 745, which is but a poor result, arising partly from the apparent inability of the late Civil Surgeon to travel about in his district during the cold season, owing to the heavy medical duties in the sadr station of Shillong as reported to me (see this office No. 3234C., dated the 17th December 1892, to the Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam). I hope the present Civil Surgeon will be able to effect better results, and I am happy to be able to say that Dr. Dobson does not think that there will be any difficulty in his doing so during his incumbency which is satisfactory as, in my opinion, the vaccination of the people in this district has suffered much from the want of such constant and personal supervision in the interior of the district during the cold season. Remarks on the vaccination results of the past year, 1892-93. 9. Comparing the figures of the past with those of the previous vaccination season, the grand total actual increase for all districts was 18,612, which is not quite as high as the figures of the previous year (19,221), merely because in that year the total number of vaccinations was exceptionally swollen by the figures for the Nága Hills and Manipur, owing to the epidemic of small-pox in both districts and the crowds of people in them who, in consequence, sought protection against that disease through vaccination. So that, in reality, the yearly increase has been continuous, and, but for those exceptional and temporary causes, would have been actually much more than in the previous year. The largest increase of vaccination during the past year in any one district (13,357) took place in the Kámrúp district, which is a strikingly successful result, showing what can be effected by an energetic Civil Surgeon, especially when well supported by the Deputy Commissioner, and great credit for this is due to Surgeon-Major J. W. Macnamara and the Deputy Commissioner, Mr. Teunon. In the same comparison, Sylhet, Darrang, Manipur, and Nowgong, in the order given, show the most satisfactory work. Tea gardens show a satisfactory increase over the figures of the previous year, which, together with the increase (4,762) since 1888-89, shows that considerable attention is now given to
4 the protection of the coolies on gardens against small-pox. The Gáro Hills show only a small increase (74) over the figures of the previous year, but there has been a general steady, though slight, increase of vaccination in those hills in the last five years. North Lushai appears for the first time in this table with 246 vaccinations, which is a fair beginning, considering the difficulties which had to be contended with. Although the Nága Hills show a large decrease (7,165) in vaccinations as compared with the results of the previous year, it must be remembered that the exceptionally high figures in that year were altogether due to a very extensive outbreak of small-pox (connected with that at Manipur), which caused the Nágas to flock in crowds to the district dispen- saries and vaccination centres for protection against this disease. The other districts which show decreases, as compared with the previous year, are Goálpára, Sibságar, Lakhimpur, and Khási and Jaintia Hills, the districts with the greatest decreases being given first in order. It is hoped that in the current year better results may be shown in the last three districts, although I may say, at least for Goálpára, that the decrease there is most unusual, and could not have been due to any want of activity or supervision on the part of the Civil Surgeon, but may have been partly due to the large increase (4,117) in the year 1891-92 over the corresponding figures of 1890 91. An Inspector of Vaccination was appointed to the Khási and Jaintia Hills before the beginning of the past vaccination season, in the hope that vaccination would be through this means much increased in that district, but, instead of an increase, there has been a decrease of 644 vaccinations from the number vaccinated in the previous year, which is unsatisfactory and arises from the reasons given at the end of paragraph 8 above. Remarks on Annual Statement No. V. 10. The annual statement No. V appended to this report has been prepared in accord- ance with Government of India, Home Department No. 65 to the total number vaccinated was highest (37.80) in North Lushai, the total number vaccinated there only came to 246, which, however, is a good beginning for such a new and uncivilised country, and is therefore creditable to Surgeon-Captain Henry Bruce Melville, the Civil Surgeon of that district.

A total of 14,947 persons, mostly children, were vaccinated on tea estates in comparison with 11,219 in the previous year, showing an increase of 3,728, or 33.23 per cent. I may mention here that the corresponding figures came to 9,992 only in 1889-90, so that there has been an increase of close on 5,000 vaccinations in tea gardens since that season. The result in the past year was due chiefly to an increase of 2,416 vaccinations by Government agency, and, in a minor but yet satisfactory degree, to an increase over the previous year of 1,312 by garden agency. The total percentage of successful vaccinations was higher by 1.56 than in the previous year. The percentage of successful vaccinations performed by Government agency was much higher than by garden agency. TABLE No. 3. Number of deaths from small-pox in Assam from 1877 to 1892. Year.

The above table is intended to show the increasing protection of the people against small-pox. The well-known fact that small-pox mortality is apt to vary from year to year should be taken into considera- tion in reading it. Notwithstanding this, it seems that our registered mortality from small-pox has decreased from an average of 1,812 yearly in the quinquennial period 1877 to 1881 and of 3,336 in the corresponding period 1882 to 1886 to 1,452 in the past year; and, as our registration has decidedly improved in the past year, and as even in the
6 previous four years it has been better than it was from 1877 to 1881, this decrease is satisfactory as showing the much increased protection of the people which has been obtained by the successful vaccinations of the past five years. Vaccination according to age. 14. The total number of primary successful operations, including the dispensary vaccinations among infants under one year of age, rose from 16,183 in 1890-91 and 22,256 in 1891-92 to 41,920 in 1892-93, the number of infants vaccinated in the past year thus showing an increase of 19,664, or 88.35 per cent. over the figures of the previous year, 1891-92. The number of successful operations amongst young children over one and under six years of age came to 114,813 in 1892-93 against 118,353 in 1891-92, a decrease of 3,540, although a consider- able increase over the figures (94,922) of 1890-91. Vaccination in proportion to births. 15. The total number of births registered in the province was 155,909 in 1892, 143,548 in 1891 and 138,326 in 1890. The percentage of successful primary vaccinations among infants under one year of age to the total number of births registered was 26.89 in 1892-93 as compared with 15.50 in 1891-92 and 11.69 in 1890-91, exhibiting a consider- able increase in favour of the past year.

The result of inspection of the licensed vaccinators' work is given in the above table and is submitted under paragraph 10 of Chief Commis- sioner's Resolution on the Annual Vaccination Report, 1885-86. The total number of vaccinations performed by this class of operators came to 33,199 during the year 1892-93 against 22,788 in 1891-92 and 18,247 in 1890-91. Out of a total of 33,199 operations, 16,224, or about half, were verified by inspection. The inspection work was very satisfactory at Goálpára, where, out of 15,821 operations 11,403, or 72.07 per cent., were inspected. The Civil Surgeon, Dr. Dobson, inspected the very large number of 4,628 operations, or 29.25 per cent. of the work performed by this class of operator in his district, as compared with 600 so inspected in Kámrúp and 15 in Sylhet, or a percentage on such operations of 4.02 and 1.52 respect- ively in those two latter districts. The percentages of successful cases as reported by the licensed vaccinators were 98.11 in Kámrúp, 96.21 in Sibságar, 95.42 in Sylhet, and 94.21 in Goálpára, but the results as found on inspection by the Native Inspectors of Vaccination were 95.93 in Sylhet, 94.01 in Kámrúp, 89.63 in Goálpára, and 88.00 in Sibságar. Of the total number of 16,224 inspections, 14,915, or 91.93 per cent., were found successful, against a total of 12,032 inspections and 10,493, or 87.21 per cent., successful cases in the previous year.

Dhubri 8 Remarks on the working of the Compulsory Vaccination Acts in 1892-93, as tabulated in Table No. 5 above, in those Municipalities, Stations, and Unions in which they are in force. General. 17. The above table No. 5 shows the places where the Compulsory Vaccination Acts [Act V (B.C.) and Act XIII, both of 1880] were in force in the past vaccination season, with the dates on which the Acts first came into force. This table also shows the number of prosecutions and convictions as well as the average number of deaths and the death-rate per mille of population from small-pox for the five years from 1888 to 1892. The total number of operations performed has increased from 1,734 in 1889-90 to 2,984 in 1892-93, and the corresponding number of successful cases has increased from 1,439 to 2,721 in those two years. Sylhet Municipality. 18. During; the year under review, 405 vaccinations were performed in this Municipality ; of which 378 were successful; and in the previous year there were 358 operations and 335 successful cases, which show an increase of 47 vaccinations and of 43 successful cases in compari- son with the figures of the previous year. Vaccination has been compulsory in this Municipality since 1st October 1882, and the practice of inoculation was prohibited by law from the 7th April 1892. No death was reported as having occurred within this Municipality in any of the last five years, except 1891, in which year 7 deaths were registered. 248 notices were issued during the year 1892-93 against 280 in 1891-92 under the Compulsory Vaccination Act. There were no prosecutions or punishments during the year 1892-93. Dhubri Municipality. 19. No separate vaccinator was entertained for this Municipality. The vaccina- tion work was performed by the medical subordinate in charge of the Dhubri Dispensary. A total of 248 opera- tions were performed during the year 1892-93, contrasted with 59 in 1891-92 and 47 in 1890-91, which is a great improvement in favour of the past year, and the corresponding number of successful cases were 174, 56, and 32 respectively in the past three years. Goálpára Municipality. 20. During the year under review 83 vaccinations were performed in this Munici- pality as contrasted with 193 in 1891-92 and 47 in 1890-91. Although the work done in 1892-93 was much less than that of 1891-92, vet it exceeded that of 1890-91. The numbers of successful vaccinations were 74, 188, and 45 in 1892-93, 1891-92, and 1890-91 respectively. There was no separate vaccinator entertained for this Municipality, and the Hospital Assistant in charge of the Goálpára Dispensary performed all the vaccination work noted above. Vaccination was made compulsory in this Municipality on 12th November 1890, but it appears from table No. 5 above that no notices under the Compulsory Vaccination Act have been issued since then. Gauháti Municipality. 21. A total of 790 vaccinations were performed in this Municipality during the year 1892-93, of which 774 proved successful, against a total of 702 operations and 587 successful cases in 1891-92, and a total of 508 operations and 444 successful cases in 1890-91. The work in this Municipality was done in a great measure under the personal supervision of the Civil Surgeon. Of the total of 790 operations, the Municipal Vaccinator performed 752 cases and the Hospital Assistant performed 38 cases. A vaccinator paid by the Municipality was retained for the whole year on a salary of Rs. 15 a month. There were 35 deaths from small-pox in this Municipality during the year 1892 and 6 in 1891, but there was no death from this disease in the year 1890. Vaccination has been compulsory in this Municipality since August 1882. 11 notices were issued in 1892-93, 28 in 1891-92, and 10 in 1890-91, and there was only one prosecution in each of the years 1892-93 and 1891-92, with no prosecution during the year 1890-91. Dibrugarh Municipality. 22. In the Dibrugarh Municipality, and also in the Dibrugarh Cantonment, Act XIII of 1880 (The Vaccination Act) has been in force since September 1883. 13 notices were issued on persons who objected to have their children vaccinated ; but, as they all permitted their children to be vaccinated after notices were issued, there was no occasion for prosecution. Vaccination was performed by a Municipal Vaccinator, who was employed for six months on a monthly salary of Rs. 12 under the supervision of the Civil Surgeon. This vaccinator performed a total of 771 operations during the past year, of which 683 were successful, as contrasted with 751 and 725 respectively in the previous year. The total expenditure during the past year under the head of vaccination was Rs. 72, against the same amount in the preceding year. 14 cases were vaccinated in the Dibrugarh Cantonment, of which 9 proved successful, against 6 cases in the previous year, all of which had been successful.
9 Silchar Station. 23. One hundred and ninety one cases of vaccination were performed in the compulsory area of this station during the year 1892-93, against 93 cases in the previous year, showing an increase of 98 cases. Out of these 191 cases, 175 were successful, against 87 in the preceding year. At my recommendation, as mentioned in paragraph 14 of the Annual Vaccination Report of Assam for 1891-92, the boundaries of the station have lately been extended, which has brought areas, hitherto lying outside it, under the operation of Act V (B.C.) of 1880 and Act IV (B.C.) of 1865 : as both these Acts are in force in this station. No cases of inoculation occurred within the station limits in the past year, and no parents refused to have their children vaccinated when required. The working of Act IV (B.C.) of 1865 is further noticed below. There were only 3 deaths from small-pox during the year 1892 against 19 in 1891. Sibságar Station. 24. Vaccination is compulsory in this station. 196 operations, with 187 success- ful cases, were performed during the year within the station limits. 29 operations, with 25 successful cases, were per- formed during the year 1892-93 from the date of the introduction of the Compulsory Vaccination Act, viz., from 21st January 1892. One vaccinator was employed by this station at a monthly salary of Rs. 10 for six months, who performed also 274 operations outside the station limits. 15 notices were issued under the Compulsory Vaccination Act. Golághát Union. 25. During the year 1892-93, 170 vaccinations were performed within the limits of this union, of which 156 were successful. As the Com- pulsory Vaccination Act was not introduced until the 24th March 1892, no accurate comparison can be made with the statistics of the previous year when vaccination was not compulsory in the Union. One vaccinator was employed by this Union at a cost of Rs. 60 during the season. He also performed 358 operations outside the Union limits. Two notices were issued during the year under the Compulsory Vaccination Act, Jorhat Union. 26. One vaccinator was entertained from the Union fund on a monthly pay of Rs. 10 and the total expenditure for the season was Rs. 60. The vaccinator had to be fined and dismissed in the middle of the season, and another man was appointed in his place. A total of 116 vaccina- tions, with 111 successful cases, were performed during the year within the Union limits ; and, in addition to these, 232 vaccinations were performed outside the Union limits. As the above table No. 5 shows only the work done under the Compulsory Vac- cination Act, and as the Act was extended to this Union only from the 12th April 1892, no comparison has been made with the statistics of the previous years. There were no prosecutions or convictions during the year 1892-93 under the Compulsory Vaccina- tion Act. Remarks on the working of Act IV (B.C.) of 1865. 27. Act IV (B.C.) of 1865 (an Act for the prohibition of the practice of inoculation) was extended in April 1892 to the towns of Sylhet, Karimganj, Sunámganj, Habiganj, Maulvi Bázár, Silchar, and Hailákándi (all in the Surma Valley). Since the introduction of this Act in the towns abovenoted, no inoculation has been reported to have been practised in them, and the number of vaccine operations which has been performed in those towns during the year 1892-93 has increased generally in comparison with the figures of the previous year. Remarks on the working of the Bovine Vaccine Depot at Shillong in 1892-93. 28. Surgeon-Major R. N. Campbell gives a statement of the working, cost, and other generally useful points in the annual report of the bovine vaccine depôt, which is appended to this report. 213,867 tubes were distributed as compared with 223,185 in the previous year, showing a decrease of 9,318 tubes, caused by the Naga Hills and Manipur having required much fewer tubes than in the previous year, when a severe epidemic of small-pox prevailed in both districts, and also to Sylhet having required fewer tubes in comparison with the previous year's supply, owing, probably, to greater success in vaccination and a consequent saving of the bovine vaccine lymph: as the total percentage of success, as given in the Annual Provincial Statement No. 1 appended to the reports for the past two years shows a difference of plus 1.61 per cent. for the Sylhet district in favour of the year just ended (1892-93) as calculated on 54,737 vaccinations done by the regular vaccination establishment alone, not counting those effected by the licensed vaccinator (984) or by dispensary vaccination agency (5,326). Taking into considera- tion such difference as would be thus explained, the demand and supply of tubes have
10 actually increased, and continue to increase, owing to the general appreciation of the quality of the lymph. Remarks on paragraph 13 of the bovine depôt report. 29. As regards Dr. Campbells remarks at paragraph 13 of the bovine vaccine depôt report for the past year attached in Appendix A. it has always, since the opening of this depôt, been held by me that the first supplies of lymph sent out should be of the best quality, so as to insure good successful results to start with in each district and in order as far as possible to make vaccination popular and sought after for the rest of the season. Kámrúp, 3rd supply, gave bad results. Darrang, 1st and 3rd ditto. Lakhimpur, 1st ditto. Cachar, 1st and 3rd ditto. Sylhet, 1st to 3rd ditto. Goálpára, 1st especially, and also 2nd and 3rd, gave bad results. Gáro Hills, 1st to 3rd ditto. During the early part of my inspections of the past year, and before I inspected the Shillong vaccine depôt on the 11th November 1892, I had heard reports that the lymph was not, up to that time, as generally successful as could have been desired. I there- fore thought fit to make the enquiries mentioned, seeing the important interests concerned, and in order to prevent a recurrence of the laxness referred to, and I am glad to say that the end I had in view was obtained, i.e., such subsequent care and exactness in the collection and in the storing, &c., of the lymph as procured even more than usually excellent results for the remainder of the season. Considering that in the three vaccination seasons from 1890-91 to 1892-93 the total percentages of successful cases of primary vaccinations for the province in each year came to 91.41, 93.50, and 93.73 respectively, the average result of the first three supplies in the districts as noted in the margin must still be considered as having been generally unsatisfactory. In the Gáro Hills a success of 99.84 per cert. was obtained in the season 1890-91 (paragraph 31, Annual Vaccination Report for that year) and in paragraph 10 of the depôt report for the same year it is mentioned that the medical officer of the 43rd Gurkha Rifles had a success of 100 per cent., which shows what can and has been effected in Assam. Of course the same success cannot be expected in October in the plains as is obtainable in December and January; but, with equal care to send out from the depôt none but good lymph properly stored in air tight tubes, there should not be any great difference in the results ; and Dr. Campbell has acknowledged that such care was not taken at the outset of the past vaccination season. With reference to the probable causes put forward by Dr. Campbell to explain the want of success in some districts, we must remember that the districts showing the unfavourable results are, or were then, in medical charge of some of the best and most careful officers in the province, who are not by any means likely to allow the lymph &quot; to lie &quot; in their offices or to display any want of &quot; care,&quot; and who in my experience of them have been always most keen in trying to make vaccination as perfect a success as possible in their respective districts. As regards the Goálpára district, Dr. Dobson informs me that he invariably sends the lymph out to the vaccinators within 24 hours of its receipt, and that he keeps a careful record of the number of the supply, so that no error in this respect could have occurred ; and I believe from experience gained at my inspections that a similar custom prevails in all the other districts. I think, however, that the precautions mentioned by Dr. Campbell as regards the preservation of the lymph and the mode of operating should be always observed, as they are certain to prove most useful. Remarks on the management of the bovine vaccine depôt at Shillong in the past season and on its present state. 30. I inspected this depôt lately, since Dr. Dobson took charge, and I found it in good order, as, indeed, it always was in Dr. Campbell's incumbency, the very temporary falling off during the last Poojahs, as above noted, having been the only exception to Dr. Campbell's otherwise successful and able management during the past season. I also examined the (glycerine) lymph, and found it to be of excellent quality. Experiments with lanoline and glycerine lymph. 31. Dr. Campbell's experiments both with lanoline and glycerine, the original report of which was submitted to the Secretary to the Chief Commissioner with this office letter No. 951S., dated the 10th October 1892, prove that, at least as far as Assam is concerned, glycerine answers much better than lanoline :APPENDICES. Annual Report of the Bovine Vaccine Depot at Shillong for the year 1892-93.
12 APPENDIX A. Annual Report of the Bovine Vaccine Depot, Shillong, for the year 1892-93. Expenditure. The total expenditure during the year was Rs. 6,314-6-4. There was expended on establish- ment for Manipur the sum of Rs. 63-0-0, which is not included in this. The expenditure is Rs. 1,100-7-3 less than that of 1891-92. A statement showing the expenditure under the various heads is herewith attached. Repairs of buildings. 2. These were of a minor nature and only cost Rs. 38-2. Water supply. 3. A sum of Rs. 460 was expended on a force pump, piping and construction of a reservoir. The water is pumped from a beautiful spring of fine water into the reservoir at the top of the hill, and then distributed, one pipe to the operating room, another to the stalls for inoculated calves, and the third to the calf house. Each has its own cock. Having this good and plentiful supply of water saves labour and enables the houses to be flushed and kept clean. Animals. 4. During the year 458 calves were purchased at a net cost of Rs. 2,023-8. Manipur has not been debited with any of this. Should the Local Government think it necessary to do so, it may be done, but as the expenditure this year is much less than last year, and there is a saving in the budget grant for 1892-93, it has not been done. The only expenditure which Manipur has been called on to pay is the cost of one servant for seven months, Rs. 63. The same contractors supplied the calves as in former years. The initial cost of each calf was Rs. 7. After being operated on they were resold for the greater part of the year for Rs. 3, but towards the end of the season for Rs. 2-8 and for a short while Rs. 2, as the year had been very bad, and so many had died that the contractor would have been out of pocket, and it would have been impossible to get him to supply calves unless he could make something out of the transaction. The account of the calves during 1892-93 is 13 The past season has been bitterly cold, colder than the previous years the depôt has been in existence, hence the greater mortality in November, December, and January as compared with the previous year. The deaths in February and March on the other hand are loss, because the weather was warm, the rain came soon, and there were no high west winds. The same care as was shown in the previous year as regards housing , feeding, &c., was shown, which tended to prevent excessive mortality. This was described in last year's report. 6. The net expenditure on calves is Rs. 2,023-8 compared with Rs 2,693-8 in the previous year and Rs. 2,453-15 in 1890-91. This decrease is in part due to the large balance of calves in hand on 1st April 1892, but chiefly to the smaller number of calves used for inoculation. Cost of feeding 7. The cost of feeding was Rs. 398-6-3, compared with Rs. 453 in 1891-92. The decrease is due to the smaller number of calves used during the year. Miscellaneous. 8. The expenditure under this head was Rs. 2,256-11-6 compared with Rs. 2,105-8-8 in the previous year. Of this sum vaccine tubes cost Rs. 1,783-11, service stamps and telegrams Rs. 33, contingencies Rs. 440-0-6. Establishment. 9. The establishment consists of one second-grade Hospital Assistant for 12 months (and a supernumerary Hospital Assistant from 24th December),* two coolies for 12 months, one coolie and one sweeper for 7 months. The cost was14 Now, these results are very good in some districts and only really bad in Gáro Hills and Sylhet, as also to a less extent in Cachar and Goálpára. The Principal Medical Officer, Assam, in his letter of 28th January appended says &quot;In nearly every case the first supplies of lymph from your depôt were actual or comparative failures. &quot; This, I think, can hardly be considered correct, after carefully considering the reports tabled above. It will be seen at a glance that the results obtained vary in each district, but that the first six districts, Nowgong, Sibságar, Manipur, Kámrúp, Darrang, and Lakhimpur give on the whole very good results, the other four districts, Cachar, Sylhet, Goálpára, and Gáro Hills, on the other hand, give poor results, more especially Sylhet and Gáro Hills. I will now proceed to analyse in detail the lymph supplied to those districts which gave bad returns and try to explain the cause of the failure. Firstly, then, as regards the lymph supplied : Sylhet.15 (d) It is a good plan to perform the operation in the shade and out of the wind, because the heat of the sun and the wind make the lymph dry on the arm before it has been rubbed in sufficient- ly to be absorbed. Should it dry too quickly, all that is necessary is to add a drop of pure water and go on rubbing. (e) The after treatment of course is not to let the cloths get near the part till it is dry, nor to wash the arm for a day or two, and to warn the parents to take care that when the vesicle rises it is not broken ; but, besides these rules, which if not carefully carried out affect the results, of course there are certain rules regarding the manufacture of lymph, which, if neglected, will impair the efficacy. The rules are16 APPENDIX TO DEPÔT REPORT. Results of the first three supplies of lymph from the Shillong Animal Vaccine Depôt. Circular No. 168., dated Shillong, the 16th November 1892.

The extent to which licensed vaccinators' operations were inspected by Civil Surgeons would appear from the statement prefixed to paragraph 16 of the report to be insufficient in some cases. The figures clearly show that inspection is necessary, and it is desirable that Civil Surgeons should take a fair share in this work, whereas the number of such inspections performed by the Civil Surgeons of Sylhet, Kámrúp, and Sibságar was 15, 600, and nil, respectively, against 4,628 inspections carried out by the Civil Surgeon of Goálpára. Vaccination in compulsory areas. 4. In the compulsory areas, where Act V (B.C.) of 1880 and Act XIII of 1880 are in force, the total number of operations performed increased from 2,191 in the preceding year to 2,984, and the number of successful operations from 2,009 to 2,721. This result is partly due to the inclusion within the compulsory areas of the Golághát and Jorhát Unions, but real progress was made in some cases, especially in the Dhubri Municipality, and in the Silchar and Sibságar Stations, and to a less extent in the Municipalities of Sylhet, Gauháti, and Dibrugarh. The results in the Goálpára Municipality, where the number of operations and of successful operations fell off from 193 and 188 in the previous year to 83 and 74, respectively, were altogether the reverse of satisfactory. In the Dibrugarh Cantonment, the number of operations (14 against 6 in the previous year) seems altogether inadequate. No notices were issued under the Act in the Municipalities of Dhubri and Goálpára, the Dibrugarh Cantonment, the Silchar Station, or the Jorhát Union, and only one prosecution was undertaken (in the Gauháti Municipality). The Chief Commissioner is glad to notice that, since Act IV (B.C.) of 1865 (an Act for the prohibition of the practice of inoculation) was extended to the towns of Sylhet, Karimganj, Sunámgarj, Habiganj, Maulvi Bázár, Silchar, and Hailákándi, in the Surma Valley, no inoculation has been reported to have been practised in these towns. Working of the Animal Lymph Depôt at Shillong. 5. A full report has been submitted by Surgeon-Major R. N. Campbell on the working of the Shillong Lymph Depôt. The results continued to be good, although for a time some falling off in the quality of the lymph is said to have been apparent. The circumstances under which this falling off took place are not altogether clear, but precautions have been taken which, it may be hoped, will prevent any similar result in future. Conclusion. 6. The Chief Commissioner desires to take the present opportunity of offering his thanks to Surgeon-Colonel C. P. Costello for the interest displayed by him in forwarding the cause of vaccination since he has held the appointment of Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commis- sioner of Assam.

FROM SURGEON-COLONEL A. STEPHEN, M.B., Offg. Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam, To THE SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER OF ASSAM. Dated Shillong, the 15th May 1894. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit the annual vaccination statements of the province of Assam for the year 1893-94, in accordance with the instructions contained in Gov- ernment of India, Home Department, letter No. 282 were found to be successful, in Goálpára the successful percentage by licensed men was 94.57, whereas in Nowgong and Gáro Hills the percentages of primary cases found to be successful were respectively 69.53 and 62.85. In all districts a large number of the vaccinations done in October and November were unsuccessful. As many of these persons were successfully vaccinated later in the season in some cases the first unsuc- cessful operations, done in the beginning of the season, seem to have been excluded from the tables, while in other cases they seem to have been included. The number of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population for the province as a whole was 28.33, the ratio varying from 17.17 in the Khási and Jaintia Hills to 65.40 in the Nága Hills. The average annual number successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population during the previous five years was 26.03. Vaccinations done in tea gardens by garden agency. 6. There were 9,282 vaccinations done in tea gardens by garden agency as against 10,541 in the previous year, all of them cases of primary vaccination. Of the cases done during the present season, 7,439, or 80.15 per cent., were successful. Dispensary vaccination. 7. From Statement No. III it appears that 12,464 vaccinations were done by dispensary establishments, of which 12,213 were primary cases, and 251 were cases of re-vaccination. Of the primary vaccinations, 7,946, or 65.06 per cent., were successful. The percentage of successful re-vaccinations done by this agency was 47.01. Last year there were 14,161 dispensary vaccinations done, 13,438 of which were primary and 723 were re-vaccinations, the percentages of primary vaccinations and re-vaccinations found successful having been respectively 81.72 and 86.30. Total number of vaccinations done in tea gardens. 8. The number of vaccinations done among the tea-garden population by Government and tea garden agencies are shown in the following table:3 successfully by Government and tea garden vaccinators, were respectively 88 86 and 80.15. In 1892-93 there were 14,947 vaccinations done in tea gardens, of which 12,603, or 84.32 per cent., were successful. There were thus 4,363 fewer operations done and 4,007 fewer successfully done in tea gardens in 1893-94 than in the previous year. Total number of operations done compared with the total number done last year. 9. The following table gives the amount of work done by all agencies during the year under review in each district as compared with last year's results:4 of 2,538 operations done in Sylhet was due to the fact that there were four more licensed vaccinators in that district than in the previous year. In Manipur there were 1,776 more operations done than in 1892-93. The Civil Surgeon states that Manipuris, Nágas, and Kukis are willing to have their children vaccinated. Districts giving the largest decrease. 11. In Darrang there were 36 per cent. fewer operations done than in the previous year, 14,314 vaccinations as against 22,522 in 1892-93. The Civil Surgeon states that the large decrease was due to the fact that the first eight supplies of lymph failed, the consequence being that no work was done till the end of December. In Nowgong there were also 36 per cent. fewer operations done than in the previous year, due, the Civil Surgeon says, to the bad lymph received during the first part of the season and to the prevalence of kála-azár. In Goálpára there were 26 per cent. and in Kámrúp 22 per cent. fewer operations done than in 1892-93. The Civil Surgeon of Goálpára attributes the decrease to the greater opposition shown by the people, especially in places where small-pox was prevalent. The decrease in Kámrúp is believed by the Civil Surgeon to have been due partly to the bad lymph received and partly to the disturbances which occurred during a portion of the vaccinating season. Number of infants and children successfully vaccinated. 12. Including vaccinations done by the dispensary establishment, there were 37,112 infants under 1 year of age and 87,519 children between the ages of 1 and 6 years successfully vaccinated during the year, as against 41,920 and 114,813, the num- bers successfully vaccinated at these respective ages during 1892-93. There were, therefore, 4,808 fewer infants and 27,294 fewer children between 1 and 6 years of age successfully vaccinated than in the previous year. There were 151,391 births registered in the province during 1893, so that the percentage of children born during the year, who were successfully vaccinated, was 24 51 as against 26.89, the percentage successfully done during 1892-93. Result of inspections made by inspecting officers. 13. Statement No. V gives the particulars of the vaccination work which was verified by inspecting officers during the vaccinating season. Excluding vaccinations done in tea gardens by tea garden agency, there were 196,890 vaccinations done in the province during the year, and of these, 9,890 were inspected by Civil Surgeons and 115,565 by Native Inspectors. Civil Surgeons found that 7,666 and Native Inspectors that 103,178 of the vaccinations inspected by them were successful, so that the percent- ages found to be successful by Civil Surgeons and Native Inspectors were respectively 77.51 and 89.28. Vaccinators reported that 86.77 per cent. of their primary vaccina- tions were successful. During the previous year, 18,074 vaccinations were inspected by Civil Surgeons and 105,070 by Native Inspectors, the percentages found successful by Civil Surgeons and Native Inspectors having been respectively 91.29 and 89.82, and in that year vaccinators reported that 93.04 per cent. of their operations were successful. In 1892-93 there were 4,628 vaccinations inspected by the Civil Surgeon of Goálpára and 4,765 by the Civil Surgeon of Sibságar ; during the year under review the numbers inspected by these officers were respectively 663 and 533. During 1893-94 there were 859 vaccinations inspected by the Civil Surgeon of the Khasi and Jaintia Hills, as against 81 in the previous year. The Civil Surgeon of the Nága Hills inspected 1,139 vaccinations, a comparatively large number when it is considered that he holds the Civil Surgeoncy as a collateral charge. The percentages of inspections made by Civil Surgeons to the total number vaccinated again vary considerably. In Sylhet and Kámrúp the percentages in question were 1.54 and 2.04, respectively, whereas the respective percentages of inspections done in Darrang and Cachar were 12.31 and 8.46. The principal reason why Civil Surgeons, as a whole, did less inspection work during 1893-94 than during the previous year, was that the first supplies of lymph failed. Vaccination work practically did not begin till December, and during the remainder of the season, Civil Surgeons were not able to overtake as much inspection work as they did in previous years during the whole season. This, however, does not account for the whole of the decrease. Nearly one-third of the vaccinating season was lost, but Civil Surgeons did little more than one-half of the number of inspections which they did in the previous year. The number of inspections made by Native Inspectors was somewhat greater than the number inspected by them during the previous year. The six Sylhet Inspectors made 47,479 inspections, as against 26,567 made by the same number in the previous year. On the other hand, the two Native Inspectors of Darrang made 15,055 inspections in 1892-93, and only 7,234 during the year under review.
5 Result of inspection of work done by licensed vaccinators. 14. The result of the inspection of work done by licensed vaccinators is given in the following table :6 Work done in places in which the Compulsory Vaccination Acts are in force. 15. The following table shows the results obtained under the Compulsory Vaccination Acts in the municipalities, stations, and unions in which they are in force : Table showing the vaccination work done tinder the Compulsory Vaccination Acts, No. V (B.C.) and XIII of 1880, in certain Municipalities, Stations, and Unions in Assam during the years 1890-91 to 1893-94.

Sylhet 7 From the table it appears that in the municipalities and unions in which vaccination is compulsory, with an aggregate population of 62,127, 2,878 persons were vaccinated during the year, and in the case of 2,154 of these the operation was successfully performed. There were altogether 700 notices issued under the Acts, 8 persons were prosecuted, and 5 were punished. During 1892-93 there were 2,721 successful operations done in places in which vaccination is compulsory, or 567 more than during the year under review. During the year 1893 there was not a single death registered from small-pox in these municipalities and unions, the small-pox death-rate for the province, as a whole, having been 0.53 per 1,000. Silchar Municipality. 16. There were 133 persons vaccinated in this municipality during the year, and in the case of 123 of them, the operation was done successfully. In 1892-93, 175 persons were successfully vaccinated. There were 70 notices issued during the year, one person was prosecuted and one was punished. No deaths occurred from small-pox during 1893. The average annual death-rate from this cause during the previous five years in this municipality was 0.66 per 1,000. Sylhet Municipality. 17. The total number vaccinated and the number successfully vaccinated in this area during the year, were respectively 425 and 344, the corresponding numbers in 1892-93 having been 405 and 378. There were 481 notices issued under the Act, but there was not a single prosecution. Dhubri Municipality. 18. One hundred and thirty-one vaccinations were done in this municipality during the year, of which 114 were successful. In 1892-93, 218 opera- tions were done, of which 174 were successful. No notices were issued under the Act during the year, and, though there was a severe outbreak of small-pox in the Goálpára district, not a single death occurred from that cause in Dhubri. Goálpára Municipality. 19. There were only 56 vaccinations done in this municipality during the year, of which 53 were successful. The corresponding figures for 1892-93 were 83 and 74. The Civil Surgeon reports that the Hospital Assistant of the Goálpára dispensary displayed little energy in this part of his work. Nine notices were issued during the year, but there were no prosecutions. Gauháti Municipality. 20. The total number vaccinated and the number successfully vaccinated during the year in this municipality were, respectively, 503 and 407, the corresponding numbers for 1892-93 having been 790 and 774. The Civil Surgeon reports that the decrease was due to the lack of energy of the vaccinator. There were no notices issued under the Act during the year. Dibrugarh Municipality. 21. The large number of 1,139 operations were done in this municipality and cantonment during the year, of which 815 were successful. In 1892-93, 692 persons were successfully vaccinated in this area. There were 114 notices issued under the Act ; 7 persons were prosecuted, and 4 were fined. Sibságar Station. 22. One hundred and seventy persons were vaccinated in this station during the year, but, owing to the first eight supplies of lymph having failed, in only 49 cases with a successful result. Eighteen notices were issued under the Act, but there were no prosecutions. Golághát Union. 23. Out of a small population of 2,211, as many as 149 vaccinations were done in Golághát, and in 114 cases the operation was successful. In the previous year 156 persons were successfully vaccinat- ed in this Union. Two notices were issued under the Act during the year, but no one was prosecuted. Jorhát Union. 24. The comparatively large number of 172 vaccinations, of which 135 were successful, were done in this small Union during the year, the corresponding numbers for the previous year having been respectively 116 and 111. There were six notices issued under the Act during the year, but no prosecutions were instituted. Inoculation. 25. From the reports of Civil Surgeons the practice of inoculation seems to be gradually dying out. It is still, however, practised to a considerable extent in the Karimganj, Habiganj and Sunám- ganj subdivisions of the Sylhet district, and in several places in Cachar. The Civil Surgeon of Lakhimpur reports that it is still widely practised among the Assamese in that district, and the Civil Surgeon of Shillong states that inoculations appear to have been lately done in a village not far from Shillong. In the other districts of the province, inoculation seems to be little practised.
8 Death rates from small-pox com- pared with the degree of protection afforded by successful vaccination. 26. In accordance with orders conveyed in Government of India, Home Depart- ment, Sanitary letter No. 49, dated the 8th February 1894, the following diagram has been prepared with a view to illustrating the death-rates from small-pox per 10,000 of population registered in 1893 in each district of the province in which the registration of vital statistics was in force previous to 1891, as well as the proportion of the population protected against the disease by successful vaccination during the seven years, 1887-88 to 1893-94 :Diagram showing the death-rates from SMALL-POX per 10,000 of population during the year 1893, and the proportion of population protected during the seven years 1887-88 to 1893-94. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] NOTE.9 From the diagram it appears that there is little relation between the death-rate from small-pox and the degree of protection afforded by successful vaccination. Were a larger proportion of the population protected, the relation would doubtless be much more obvious. Animal lymph depôt at Shillong. 27. The annual report of the animal lymph depôt at Shillong by Surgeon-Major Dobson is given in Appendix A to this Report. The supplies of lymph sent from the depôt to Civil Surgeons at the beginning of the vaccinating season were quite inert. The first five supplies of lymph received by the Civil Surgeon of Sylhet were bad. The Civil Surgeon of Lakhimpur states that the first seven supplies he got were inert, and the general experience of Civil Surgeons was that vaccinations done by lymph received from the depôt up to the middle of November were unsuccessful. They are, however, unanimous in reporting that the lymph received after the 7th of December was excellent. On learning that the depôt lymph had failed, Surgeon-Colonel Warburton telegraphed to the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner of Darjiling on the 13th November 1893 to send 25 tubes of vaccine lymph to each Civil Surgeon of Assam, and some good work was done by means of this lymph before supplies of lymph of good quality began to be received from Shillong. The failure of the depôt lymph was principally due to the fact that the Hospital Assistant in charge of the depôt was inexperienced. He was trans- ferred to the depôt only on the 10th of August 1893, and previous to his arrival he had no opportunity of becoming acquainted with the work. The Civil Surgeon, Surgeon-Major Dobson, had also had little previous experience of the working of the depôt. He had seen nothing of lymph depôt work till he joined his appointment in Shillong in April 1893. Decrease in the amount of work done due principally to the failure of the depôt lymph in the begin- ning of the season. 28. There is no doubt that the decrease in the amount of work done during the vaccinating season of 1893-94, as compared with last year's results, was principally due to the failure of the vaccine lymph sent from the depôt in October and November, and the small percentage of successful cases was also princi- pally due to the same cause. When people found that the operations were failures, they began to lose faith in vaccination, and in several places they afterwards refused to allow their children to be vaccinated. To prevent a similar failure in future, the Hospital Assistant in charge of the depôt will be changed as seldom as possible. With the concur- rence of the Chief Commissioner, vaccine lymph will also not be sent to the districts in the plains till the 1st of November, and Civil Surgeons will be requested to personally test the first supplies of lymph received, and not to pass it on to the vaccinators till they satisfy themselves that it is of good quality. Inoculation of goats. 29. At the end of his report on the animal lymph depôt, Dr. Dobson gives the results of the inoculation of 7 goats with vaccine lymph. I agree with Dr. Dobson that no advantage is likely to be gained by substituting goats for calves for the purpose of obtaining lymph in this province. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient Servant, A. STEPHEN, M.B., Surgeon-Colonel, Offg. Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam. C
APPENDICES. Annual Report of the Bovine Vaccine Depot at Shillong for the year 1893-94. D
13 APPENDIX A. Annual Report of the Bovine Vaccine Depot, Shillong, for the year 1893-94. Expenditure. The total expenditure during the year was Rs. 5,506-9-4, which is Rs. 807-13 less than last year. Last year there was expended for Manipur Rs. 63 ; this year the amount comes to Rs. 248. The amount so expended is not included in the working expenses of the depôt. Repairs of buildings. 2. This cost Rs. 69-1-6 during the year against Rs. 38-2 last year. Animals. 3. During-the year 515 calves were purchased at a net cost of Rs. 2,349-8, besides this 7 goats cost Rs. 6-15-6, whereas last year 458 calves were purchased for Rs. 2,023-8. Manipur has not been debited with any of this. The initial cost of each calf has remained the same as last year, viz., Rs. 7. After being operated on, each calf is resold to the contractor who originally supplied it for Rs 3 from 1st April to 31st December, and for Rs. 2-8 each from 1st January to 31st March. The same man has supplied the calves ever since the depôt was started in Shillong, in 1890-91. He now refuses to renew his contract for the coming year unless his rates are enhanced, and gives as his reason for so acting that &quot; we have refused a very large number of calves, and that these died on his hands.&quot; If his excuse is true, we have every reason to be satisfied with our action, for it is absolutely necessary that we should never accept calves unless in perfect health. We are equally fair to him, inasmuch as we give him the option of refusing to take back any calf that has been operated on, till he is quite satisfied it is in perfect health. This year we have rejected 55 calves. No record was kept of the number of calves rejected the year before. A fresh contract, but on the same terms, has just been executed with a new contractor. I think it will be found to work well ; whatever we do, we cannot allow sickly calves to be operated on. The account of the calves during 1892-93 and 1893-94 is14 4.

The deaths among the calves since 1890-91 are as follows :15 (Compare above with paragraph 1, where we say &quot; last year there was expended for Manipur Rs. 63, this year the amount comes to Rs. 248. The amount so expended is not included in the working expenses of the depôt. 10. During the year 491 calves were inoculated, of which 12 died in stalls, and lymph was not taken from 17 others, as the vesicles were not up to our standard of excellence, and thus reduced the number from which lymph was taken to 462. In 1892-93, 483 inoculated calves gave 15 deaths in stalls and 29 failures, which reduced the number from which lymph was obtained to 439. 11. The number of tubes loaded was 238,282, or an average of 515.76 per calf. The number in 1892-93 was 224,403, or an average of 511.11 per calf. Distribution. 12. During the year lymph was distributed to every Civil Surgeon in the province, including Manipur and Lushai. The weekly supply forwarded to the various Civil Surgeons was16 Although the lymph continued to give unsatisfactory results much longer in some districts than in others, yet we find that it continued to be distributed broadcast to the vaccinators as soon as it arrived without its being first tested by the Civil Surgeon of the district. If lymph will not keep a week, it cannot be prudent to use it at all, and there was nothing easier than arranging to test it, so long as there was reason for being suspicious about its quality before distributing it, to be used on hundreds of persons. Thus I find one Civil Surgeon writing17 Statement of Net Expenditure incurred during the year 1893-94. 18 A.19 A.20 B.21 COMPARATIVE STATEMENT No. IV.

ASSAM SECRETARIAT PRINTING OFFICE (GENERAL) No. 48Resolution on the Vaccination Report for 1893-94. Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner of Assam, in the General Department, No. 5179G., dated the 21st July 1894. Read2 5. The areas of compulsory vaccination, in which Act V (B.C.) of 1880 or Act XIII of 1880 are in force, are the chief towns of the plains districts (except Nowgong and Tezpur), and the three subdivisional towns of Goalpara, Jorhat, and Golaghat, containing a total population of 62,127. The number of successful vaccinations performed in these towns was much less than in the previous year. It is satisfactory, however, that not a single death from small-pox occurred in the compulsory areas during the year. 6. In paragraph 25 of the report reference is made to the practice of inoculation which is reported to be still carried on to some extent in parts of the Sylhet, Cachar, and Lakhimpur districts. The question was fully considered as regards Sylhet in 1892, and, with the approval of the Government of India, Act IV (B.C.) of 1865, which prohibits the practice of inoculation, was extended to all the sadr and subdivisional towns in the Surma Valley. Gauhati is the only town in the Assam Valley to which the Act has been extended, the extension having been notified in 1873 when Assam formed a part of Bengal. The only hill district in which the practice of inoculation has been brought to notice is that of the Khasi Hills, the position in regard to which is somewhat peculiar, in that it consists mainly of petty semi-independent States where the prohibition could hardly be enforced. The Chief Commissioner has considered whether Bengal Act IV of 1865 should not be extended to other areas, but, on the whole, he has come to the conclusion that it is not expedient or necessary to take such action, especially as the practice is reported to be gradually dying out. The point should, however, be carefully watched and dealt with by executive action. 7. An account of the working of the Shillong animal lymph depôt is appended to the report. It is much to be regretted that the lymph supplied from the depôt in the early part of the season was found ineffective. This is said to have been due principally to the fact that the Hospital Assistant in charge of the depôt was inexperienced. The Civil Surgeon also had had no previous experience of lymph depôt work. The then Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner took all possible steps to remedy the failure. Lymph was procured from Bengal for immediate use, and it is reported that the lymph received from the Shillong depôt after the 7th December was excellent. The Officiating Chief Commissioner approves of the measures proposed by the Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner for preventing a recurrence of such failure. It is especially important that the Hospital Assistant in immediate charge of the depôt should be an experienced man. Failures such as this not only vitiate operations in hand, but also do much harm by diminishing the confidence of the people in the efficacy of vaccination.

No. 616S. FROM SURGEON-COLONEL A. STEPHEN, M.B., Offg. Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam, To THE SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER OF ASSAM. Shillong, the 17th May 1895. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit the Annual Vaccination Statements of the Province of Assam for the year 1894-95 with the following remarks. Number of vaccinators. 2. The average number of vaccinators employed in each district, exclusive of the dispensary staff, and the details of the work done by them, are given in Statement No. I. Including licensed and apprentice vaccinators, there were 230 Inspectors and vaccinators on an average at work during the year, as against 217 in 1893-94. There were 17 native Inspectors and 162 paid vaccinators employed as against 16 native Inspectors and 154 paid vaccinators in the previous year. There were 46 licensed vaccinators at work, being one less than the number employed in 1893-94. A native Inspector was appointed during the year in the Nága Hills district. Four additional paid vaccinators were employed in the Sylhet district, three in Kámrúp and two in the Nága Hills district; there were 11 vaccinators in the Nowgong district as against 12 in 1893. In the Sylhet district the five licensed vaccinators employed last year were replaced by five apprentice vaccinators ; in the Goálpára district, three additional licensed vaccinators were employed, and in Kámrúp 24 licensed vaccinators were at work, as against 23 in the previous year. Cost of the department. 3. Statement II contains a detailed statement of the cost of the department for the year. The total expenditure amounted to Rs. 18,833-1-4, as against Rs. 17,999-7-1 in 1893-94, an increase of Rs. 833-10-3. Of the total cost, Rs. 7,913-13-3 were met from Provincial Funds, Rs. 9,289-6-7 from Local Funds, Rs. 728-13-6 from Municipal Funds and Rs. 901 were contributed by the Manipur State. As 129,303 successful vaccinations were done by paid vaccinators, the cost of each successful vaccination done by them was 2 annas and 4 pies as against I anna and 11 2/3 pies in the previous year. Vaccinations done by paid and licensed vaccinators. 4. The total number of vaccinations done by paid and licensed vaccinators during the year was 181,477, as against 184,426 in the year 1893-94, a decrease of 2,949 operations. Of these operations, 177,492 were primary and 3,985 were cases of re-vaccination. In the previous year there were 179,487 primary vaccinations and 4,939 re-vaccinations done, the primary operations exceeding the number done during the year under review by 1,995 and the cases of re-vaccination by 954. Percentage of operations found to be successful. 5. From Statement I it appears that 155,837 of the primary vaccinations done by paid and licensed vaccinators were successful, the percentage found to be successful having been 87.80. Last year the percentage of successful primary cases was 86.77, 155,749 of the operations having been successful, being 88 fewer than the primary cases done successfully in 1894-95. The percentage of re-vaccinations found to be successful was B
2 61.25, as against 78.05 per cent. done successfully last year. The percentages of primary vaccinations done successfully varied very much in different districts. In the cool districts of Manipur, Nága Hills and Khási and Jaintia Hills the ratios were respectively 98.98, 95.75 and 91.63, and in Lakhimpur, which is cooler during the winter months than the other districts in the plains, it was 90.84. In the Nowgong and Cachar districts, on the other hand, the ratio of successful cases was only 56.55 and 62.93 per cent., respectively. Proportion of population suc- cessfully vaccinated. 6. There were 28.88 per 1,000 of the population of the province successfully vaccinated during the year, as against 29.65 per 1,000 done successfully in the previous year, and 28.42 per 1,000, the average proportion done successfully during the previous five years. Dispensary vaccination. 7. Details of dispensary vaccination are given in Statement III. From the statement it appears that dispensary establishments performed 12,302 vaccine operations, of which 11,842 were primary and 460 were cases of re-vaccination. Of the primary vaccinations 9,677, or 81 72 per cent., were successful, and 297 of the re-vaccinations were found to be successful, the proportion of successful cases having been 64.57 per cent. Last year, 12,464 dispensary vaccinations were done ; 12,213 primary and 251 re-vaccinations. Of the primary operations 7,946, and of the re-vaccinations 118, were successful, the percentages of successful cases being respectively 65.06 and 47.01. Total number of vaccinations done in tea gardens. 8. The details of vaccination work done during the year in tea-gardens by Government and tea-garden agencies are given in the following table : Table showing the vaccination work among the garden population performed by Government and tea-garden agencies respectively during 1894-95.

Of the 6,358 vaccinations done by tea garden agency, 4,452, or 70.02 per cent., were successful. Last year, 9,282 vaccina- tions were done in tea gardens by this agency, and of these, 7,439, or 80.15 percent., were done successfully. Of the 849 vaccinations in tea gardens done by Government agency, 448, or 52.77 per cent., were successful. There were altogether 4,900 operations done successfully in tea gardens, a percentage of 67.99. Last year, 8,596 out of 10,684 operations were done successfully, the percentage of successful cases having been 81.22.

There was an increase in the number of vaccinations done in 8 out of the 13 districts of the province ; the decrease in the province, as a whole, was due to many fewer operations having been done in the Sylhet and Darrang districts than in the previous year. Districts in which the greatest increase occurred. 10. In the Kámrúp district there were 6,603 more vaccinations done than in the previous year. This large increase was partly due to three additional vaccinators having been employed, but it was principally due to the great personal interest which Surgeon- Major Campbell, the Civil Surgeon, took in vaccination work. There was also a substantial increase of 5,769 operations in the Sibságar district. Surgeon-Lieutenant- Colonel Borah, the Civil Surgeon, states that the vaccination staff of this district worked very well, especially those employed in the Sibságar and Jorhát subdivisions ;- and much credit is due to the Civil Surgeon for the increased energy which he was able to infuse into his subordinates. Districts in which the greatest decrease occurred. 11. In the Sylhet district there were 12,055 fewer operations done than in the previous year, though there were four more vaccinators at work. The Civil Surgeon states that the decrease was due partly to the bad quality of the Shillong lymph, and partly to the fact that no lymph was received from the depôt in November. From his annual returns it would appear that the lymph supplied to him must have been, on the whole, good, as 94.12 per cent. of the primary vaccinations done by his paid vaccinators were successful. There were 3,543 fewer operations done in the Darrang district than in 1893-94 ; and it is worthy of remark that there were 8,208 fewer operations done in that district in 1893-94 than in 1892-93. The Civil Surgeon states that the decrease was due to the inefficiency of the Shillong lymph. The general results show that the Shillong lymph was not worse than the lymph supplied by that depôt in 1893-94, and it was of exactly the same quality as the lymph supplied to the neighbouring district of Kámrúp, in which comparatively very good results were obtained. Number of infants and children successfully vaccinated. 12. Including the work done by the dispensary establishment, there were 40,082 infants under one year of age and 90,464 children between the ages of one and six years of age successfully vaccinated during the season, as compared with 37,112 and 87,519, the respective-numbers done successfully at these ages during 1893-94. There were thus 2,970 more infants and 2,945 more children between the ages of one and six years successfully vaccinated than in the previous year. There were 156,153 births registered during 1894, so that 25.7 per cent. of the children born during the year were successfully vaccinated, as against 24.5 per cent. successfully vaccinated in 1893-94.

4 Results of inspections made by inspecting officers. 13. The particulars of vaccination work verified by inspecting officers are contained in Statement V. From the statement, it appears that of the 193,779 vaccinations done during the season by all agencies, with the exception of garden agencies on tea gardens, 13,541 operations were inspected by Civil Surgeons and 120,796 by native Inspectors. Civil Surgeons found that 10,908 of the vaccinations inspected by them were successful, and native Inspectors reported 105,361 successful cases, so that the percentages of cases inspected found successful by Civil Surgeons and native Inspectors were, respectively, 80.56 and 87.22. Vaccinators reported that 87.80 per cent. of primary vaccinations done by them were successful. During 1893-94, Civil Surgeons inspected 9,890 and native In- spectors 115,565 operations, and the percentages found to be successful were, respectively, 77.51 and 89.28. A comparison of the results shows that Civil Surgeons inspected 3,651 and native Inspectors 5,231 more operations than in the previous season. Among Civil Surgeons, the largest number of inspections, 3,497, was made by the Civil Surgeon of Sibságar, he having inspected 15.98 per cent. of the vaccinations performed in his district during the season. A considerable number of inspections were made by the Civil Surgeons of Goálpára, Darrang and Kámrúp. There were 1,051 inspections made by the Civil Surgeon of Manipur, a very creditable outturn, as he holds the Civil Surgeoncy as a collateral charge. There were very few inspections made by the Civil Surgeons of Cachar, Lakhimpur, Nowgong and Sylhet. The Civil Surgeons of Cachar and Lakhimpur had some difficulty in leaving headquarters on inspection duty, as, during a considerable portion of the vaccinating season, they were in medical charge of the troops stationed at the headquarters of their districts. The Civil Surgeon of the Khási and Jaintia Hills district inspected only 236 operations. He is in charge of the lymph depôt at Shillong, and I requested him not to leave the station during the vaccinating season, as the lymph depôt requires daily supervision. The six native Inspectors of Sylhet district verified the results in 43,511 cases, as against 47,479 in 1893-94. In Sibságar district, 17,606 cases were inspected by the native Inspector, as compared with 11,316 inspections made by him in the previous year. In the plains districts, the native Inspectors of the Cachar and Groálpára districts made the fewest inspections. Inspection of work done by licensed vaccinators. 14. The proportion of vaccinations done by licensed vaccinators, found after inspection to be successful, is given in the following table : Table showing the number of licensed vaccinators' operations inspected by the Civil Surgeons and Native Inspectors during the year 1894-95.

The percentages of operations inspected found to be successful by Civil Surgeons and Native Inspectors were, therefore, 91.56 and 87.77, respectively. In last year's report it was noted that Civil Surgeons had apparently overlooked the instructions contained in Government of India letter No. 223, dated the 4th Novem- ber 1893, regarding the desirability of having the work of licensed vaccinators closely scrutinized. The attention of Civil Surgeons was particularly called to this subject in September 1894. From the table, it appears that 42 per cent. of the work of licensed
5 vaccinators were inspected, as against 39 per cent. inspected in the previous year. In the Sibságar district all the vaccinations done by licensed men were inspected. The atten- tion of Civil Surgeons will again be particularly called to this important subject in the beginning of next vaccinating season. Results obtained in places in which the Vaccination Acts are in force. 15. The results obtained in municipalities, stations and unions in which the Compulsory Vaccination Acts are in force are given in the following table : Table showing the vaccination work done under the Corripulsory Vaccination Acts, Nos.

Sylhet 6 In the nine towns in which vaccination is compulsory, with an aggregate population of 62,127, there were 3,637 persons vaccinated in 1894-95 and 2,523 of these were opera- ted on successfully. In 1893-94 there were 2,878 vaccinations done in these towns with a successful result in 2,154 cases. During 1894 there were 49 small-pox deaths registered in these towns, the death-rate from this cause having been 0.79 per 1,000. The death-rate from small-pox in the province as a whole was 0.80 per 1,000. During the year there were 673 notices issued under the Acts in towns in which vaccination is compulsory, 47 persons were prosecuted, but no punishments were inflicted. In 1893 94 there were 700 notices issued, eight persons were prosecuted and five were punished. Silchar Municipality. 16. There were 159 persons vaccinated in this municipality, and 86 of them were operated on successfully. In 1893-94, 123 persons were successfully vaccinated. There were 75 notices issued under the Act, but no one was prosecuted. There was not a single small-pox death registered during the year. Sylhet Municipality. 17. There were 326 vaccinations done with a successful result in 236 cases. In 1893-94, 344 persons were successfully vaccinated in this municipality. There were 305 notices issued, but no one was prosecuted. One small-pox death was registered during the year. Dhubri Municipality. 18. Out of 573 vaccinations done during the year, 375 were successful. There were no notices issued under the Act. Eleven deaths from small-pox were registered during the year. Goálpára Municipality. 19. There were 120 persons successfully vaccinated in this municipality during the year, out of 217 who were operated on. In 1893-94, 53 persons were successfully vaccinated. Thirty-two small- pox deaths were registered during the year, a death rate of 5.9 per 1,000. There were&quot; 99 notices issued and 47 persons were prosecuted, but no one was punished. Gauháti Municipality. 20. Six hundred and fifty vaccinations, of which 364 were successful, were done during the year. In 1893-94, 407 persons were successfully vaccinated. Two small-pox deaths occurred during the year. There were 14 notices issued, but no one was prosecuted. Dibrugarh Municipality and Can- tonment. 21. There were 1,118 vaccinations done in the municipality and cantonment, with a successful result in 829 cases. Last year 815 persons were successfully vaccinated. There were 177 notices issued , but no prosecutions were instituted. Two small-pox deaths were registered in this area during the year. Sibságar Station. 22. Three hundred and three persons were successfully vaccinated in this station out of 350 operated on. One small-pox death occurred during the year. Three notices were issued, but no one was prosecuted. Golághát Union. 23. Out of 103 vaccinations done, 95 proved to be successful. In 1893-94, 114 persons were successfully vaccinated. No notices were issued under the Act. Jorhát Union. 24. In this Union 115 persons were successfully vaccinated out of 141 operated on. No notices were issued under the Act; not a single death from small-pox was registered. Inoculation. 25. Inoculation continues to be frequently practised in the Surma Valley, and the Civil Surgeon of Cachar states that the outbreaks of small- pox which occurred during the year in Lakhipur and Nagdirgram, originated directly from inoculation. The Civil Surgeon of Lakhimpur states it is widely practised among the Assamese of his district, and the Civil Surgeon of the Khási and Jaintia Hills reports that an inoculator was at work at Shella and Mustoh, near Cherra. In the other districts of the province Civil Surgeons report that inoculation is not practised. Mortality from small-pox com- pared, district by district, with the amount of protection afforded by successful vaccination. 26. The accompanying diagram has been prepared, in accordance with orders:conveyed in Government of India, Home Department, Sanitary, letter No. 49, dated the 8th February 1894, with a view to com- paring the death-rates from small-pox, district by district, registered in 1894, with the proportion of the population protected by successful vaccination during the seven years 1888-89 to 1894-95.

DIAGRAM showing the death-rates from SMALL-POX per 10,000 of population during the year 1894, and the proportion of population protected during the seven years, 1888-89 to 1894-95. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] NOTE*.7 As noted in last year's report, there seems to be little relation between the death- rate from small-pox in 1894 and the proportion of successful vaccinations done during the last seven years. The relation would be doubtless much more obvious if a larger proportion of the population were protected. Animal lymph depôt at Shillong. 27. The Annual Report of the Animal Lymph Depôt at Shillong, by Surgeon- Captain Carroll, is given as Appendix A to this report. The expenditure on the depôt, Rs. 6,815-2, was Rs. 1,308-8-8 in excess of the expenditure incurred last year. The increase in the expendi- ture was principally due to the larger number of calves inoculated and to the increased mortality among the calves, cattle-disease, similar to the epidemic of 1890-91, having been very prevalent. Lymph was not sent from the depôt till the end of October, and Civil Surgeons agree in reporting that the first supplies were of excellent quality. The quality of lymph supplied remained very fairly good till about the middle of December, when it began to deteriorate, and that supplied during January and the first week of February to most of the districts in the plains proved almost inert. The lymph supplied during the remainder of February and the whole of March was, on the whole, good. On finding out that lymph of bad quality was being furnished by the Shillong depôt, I telegraphed to the Superintendent of the Darjeeling depôt, requesting him to be good enough to send supplies of bovine lymph to the Civil Surgeons of this province and to the depôt at Shillong. The deterioration in the quality of the lymph was doubtless due to the Civil Surgeon of Shillong, in his endeavour to supply as much lymph as possible, sending out lymph taken from calves inoculated with lymph which had passed directly through four generations of calves without having been strengthened by humanised lymph. On finding that the Civil Surgeon of Shillong was supplying lymph of the fifth generation, I directed him not to send out lymph in future which had passed more than three generations through calves without having been humanised. The lymph sent out in January was not altogether inert, as the Civil Surgeon of Manipur reports that it was excellent. The results obtained in the Nága Hills during that month were also very good, and a portion of that supplied to Lakhimpur was efficient. In consequence of its not having been sufficiently strengthened by the addition of human lymph, it was not, however, sufficiently strong to resist the effects of the climate in the Surma Valley and the lower portions of the Assam Valley. By arranging to have a sufficient supply of active human lymph, and by not sending out any lymph beyond the third generation, I believe that the Civil Surgeon will be able to supply efficient lymph next season from the Shillong depô . I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, A. STEPHEN, M.B., Surgeon Colonel, Offg. Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam.
ANNUAL FORMS AND APPENDICES.
11 A.12 A.13 B.14 Comparative Statement No. IV.15 Statement No. V16 APPENDIX A. Annual Report of the Bovine Vaccine Depot, Shillong, for the year 1894-95. Total expenditure. 1. The total expenditure during the year was Rs. 6,815-2, being Rs. 1,308-8-8 in excess of that of the previous year. The causes of this excess will be explained under the various heads below. A sum of Rs. 289 was expended for Manipur, which is not included in the above. Petty construction and repairs. 2. These cost Rs. 146, being about Rs. 80 more than the year before. Two small rooms were added to the godown. The pump was very frequently out of order, and Rs. 24 were spent on its repair. It will probably be necessary to procure a new one. Animals. 3. During the year, 569 calves were bought at a net cost of Rs. 3,150. None of this was charged to Manipur. After being operated upon, the calves were resold to the contractor for Rs. 3 each up to the end of November, and for Rs. 2-4 each from December 1st to the end of the season. The latter rate was 4 annas less than in previous years, the reduction being made, as the contractor was suffering loss from the prevalence of epidemic cattle-disease in the district. This epidemic diarrhoea caused the deaths of most of the 199 calves which died, the mortality being about the same as occurred in 1890-91, another epidemic year. The contractor has, I believe, been a heavy loser this year, owing to the large number of deaths among unprotected calves in his hands. During the epidemic, he was given Rs. 9 for each calf, as otherwise he could not have supplied them. The total amount lost to the depôt from the excessive mortality, and the lower re- selling price was Rs. 310-2, and Rs. 157-8 were paid to the contractor for calves purchased at a price higher than the contract rate. The contractor was a new man, and his work was by no means satis- factory, as he frequently failed to supply calves, and also brought many weakly ones. A new con- tract has been made with three men, the initial cost of each calf to be, as before, Rs. 7, but the returning prices have been reduced to Rs. 2-8 and Rs. 2. . This reduction was undoubtedly necessary, as the contractors cannot be expected to work without some profit. The people who supply calves to the contractors have now become well aware that the Vaccine depôt must have calves, and have raised their prices accordingly. The account of the calves for 1893-94 and 1894-95 is as follows : UNPROTECTED CALVES. 1893-94. 1894-95.

The net expenditure on calves was Rs. 3,150, compared with Rs. 2,359 in 1893-94. The causes of the excess this year, apart from the fact that 94 more calves were vaccinated, have been stated in paragraph 3. Cost of feeding. 6. The cost of feeding the calves was Rs. 381-13, while in the previous year it was Rs. 287-6-6. In addition to the much larger number of calves inoculated this year, many, which were ill after taking lymph, had to be kept a considerably longer time than usual. Miscellaneous. 7. The expenditure this year under this heading was Rs. 1,817-8-8. In 1893-94 it was Rs. 1,731-7-3. Of this amount, the cost of vaccine tubes was Rs. 1,425-0-3, service stamps and telegrams Rs. 51-4-0, and contingen- cies Rs. 341-4-5. Establishment. 8. The establishment consists of a second-grade Hospital Assistant, with a special allowance of Rs. 20 a month, a clerk at Rs. 10, a loader at Rs. 12, a coolie at Rs. 9, and a coolie and sweeper at Rs. 9 each, engaged for 7 months in the year. The cost was18 that produced by inoculating with humanised lymph), but to supply the large number of tubes mentioned, it was necessary to send out lymph of the fourth and occasionally of the fifth generation. Besides this relative deficiency of humanised lymph, there was an actual deficiency as compared with previous years, due to failure on the part of the vaccinators who should have supplied it We rely for this lymph on the vaccinators in the Khási Hills, and it is very difficult to procure good workers. Five vaccinators are employedASSAM SECRETARIAT PRINTING OFFICE (GENERAL) No. 124Resolution on the Vaccination Report for 1894-95. Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner of Assam, in the General Department, No. 3510G., dated the 25th June 1895. Read2 5. It was noticed in the report for 1893-94 that no deaths from small-pox had occurred in the towns (containing an aggregate population of 62,127) in which Compulsory Vaccination Acts were in force. At the same time the Chief Commissioner observed that the number of successful vaccinations performed in these towns had fallen off considerably. In 1894-95, 49 deaths from small-pox were registered in these towns, the death-rate from this cause having been 0.79 per 1,000, as compared with a provincial death-rate of 0.80 per 1,000. The Chief Commissioner is, however, glad to see that a larger number of persons have been successfully vaccinated during the year. No addition was made during the year to the towns in which Compulsory Vaccination Acts are in force; but notifications have recenly been issued extending Act V (B.C.) of 1880 and Act IV (B.C.) of 1865 to the Civil Station, and Act XIII of 1880 to the Cantonment, of Shillong. 6. Inoculation is reported to be still practised in the Surma Valley, in the Lakhim- pur district, and the Khasi and Jaintia Hills. The question of extending Act IV (B.C.) of 1865 to these areas has been frequently considered by the Chief Commissioner. It was considered again last year, and the decision arrived at was that it was not necessary or expedient to take action in this direction as regards areas outside towns, especially as the practice is reported to be gradually dying out, but that the point should be watched and dealt with, as far as possible, by executive action. The Chief Commis- sioner will be glad to receive a fuller report of the cases in which small-pox epidemics in the Cachar district are said to have originated directly from inoculation. 7. An account of the working of the Shillong Animal Lymph depôt is appended to the report. The Chief Commissioner regrets that the working of the depôt has again been unsatisfactory, so far that inert lymph was supplied for some weeks during the vaccination season. The bad results of vaccination work during the last two years are, no doubt, due primarily to the supply of ineffective lymph during a portion of each season, and the Chief Commissioner hopes that every effort will be made to place the working of the depôt on a satisfactory footing. As pointed out in the Resolution on last year's report, such failures in lymph not only injure the vaccination work of the season, but also do much indirect harm by creating distrust of vaccination in the minds of the people. The Chief Commissioner observes that the Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner has issued instructions to remedy the defects in the working of the depôt, and that it is believed that efficient lymph will be supplied from the depôt throughout next season; but, if the present results should continue, it may be necessary to consider whether the depôt should not be closed.

No. 621S. FROM SURGEON-COLONEL A. STEPHEN, M.B., Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam, To THE SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER OF ASSAM. Shillong, the 15th May 1896. SIR, I HAVE the honour to forward the Vaccination Statements of the Province of Assam for the year 1895-96, with the following remarks. Number of vaccinators employed. 2. Statement No. I gives the average number of vaccinators employed during the season in each district, excluding the dispensary staff and tea- garden agencies, and the details of the work done by them. There were, on an average, 18 Inspectors, 158 paid and 48 licensed vaccinators, and 7 apprentices at work during the year, as against 17 Inspectors, 162 paid and 46 licensed vaccinators and 5 apprentices employed in 1894-95. In the Sylhet district, an additional Inspector of Vaccination was employed, the number of vaccinators was reduced from 51 to 49, and an additional apprentice was entertained. In the Goalpara district, four fewer licensed vaccinators were employed than in the previous year. In the Kamrup district, four additional licensed vaccinators were enter- tained and the services of three paid vaccinators were dispensed with. An apprentice vaccinator was employed throughout the season in the Darrang district. In the Nowgong district, an additional paid vaccinator, and in the Sibsagar district two additional licensed vaccinators were employed. Cost of the department. 3. A detailed account of the cost of the department is given in Statement No. II. The salaries of Inspectors and paid vaccinators amounted to Rs. 3,644-10-3 and Rs. 12,384-14-4, respectively, Rs. 3,166-14 were spent on travelling allowances and Rs. 745-11-3 on contingencies, so that the total expenditure for the year amounted to Rs. 19,942-1-10. The expenditure during 1894-95 was Rs. 18,833-1-4, or Rs. 1,109-0-6 less than that incurred during the year under review. Of the amount spent, Rs. 8,305-1 were met from Provincial Funds, Rs. 9,660-14 from Local Funds, Rs. 841-12-10 from Municipalities, and Rs. 1,134-6 were contributed by the Manipur State. There were 202,102 successful vaccinations done by paid vaccinators, so that each successful vaccination cost, on an average, one anna and seven pies, as against two annas and four pies in the previous year. Vaccinations done by paid and licensed vaccinators. 4. From Statement No.I it appears that the total number of vaccinations done by paid and licensed vaccinators during the season was 233,812, as against 181,477 in the previous season,2 Percentage of successful opera- tions. 5. Of the 227,114 primary vaccinations done by paid and licensed vaccinators, 221,992, or 97.74 per cent., were successful. 'Last year 155,837 primary vaccinations were done successfully by the same agencies, or 66,155 fewer than the number done successfully during the year under review. In 1894-95, the percentage of successful cases was 87.80. Of the 6,698 cases of re-vaccination, 5,893, or 87.98 per cent., were successful. In 1894-95, 2,441 re-vaccinations were done successfully, the percentage of successful cases having been 61.25. The lowest percentage of successful primary vaccinations, 85.05, was obtained in the North Lushai Hills, and the next lowest, 90.32 and 91.49, were the respective percentages obtained in the Khasi and Jaintia Hills and in the Garo Hills districts. The results obtained in the districts in the plains were very satisfactory. Proportion of the population suc- cessfully vaccinated. 6. Including the cases done successfully in tea gardens by tea-garden agencies, there were 42.97 per 1,000 of the population of the province successfully vaccinated during the year, as against 28.88 per 1,000 done successfully during 1894-95. The average number of persons successfully vaccinated annually during the previous five years was 164,908, and during that period 29.27 per 1,000 of the population were, on an average, successfully vaccinated annually. Dispensary vaccination. 7. From Statement No. III it appears that dispensary establishments performed 10,456 vaccinations during the year, of which 10,005 were primary and 451 were cases of re-vaccination. Of the primary vaccinations, 9,513, or 95.08 per cent., were successful, and of the 451 cases of re-vaccination, 371, or 82.26 per cent., were done successfully. Last year, 11,842 primary vaccinations and 460 re-vaccinations, a total of 12,302 operations, were done by the dispensary establishment. In that year,of the primary operations, 9,677, or 81.72 per cent., and of the re-vaccinations, 297, or 64.57 per cent., were done success- fully. Vaccination work in tea gardens. 8.

Of the 16,422
3 operations done by tea-garden agency, 14,245, or 86.74 per cent., were performed successfully, and 1,258 out of the 1,303, or 96.55 per cent., of the operations done by Government vaccinators, were successful. The results obtained by tea-garden agency were thus not nearly so good as those obtained by Government vaccinators in tea gardens and among the general population of the province. During 1894-95 there were 7,207 vaccinations done in tea gardens, and of these 4,900, or 67.99 per cent., were done successfully.

In the Sibsagar district, 5,769 more vaccinations were done in 1894-95 than in the previous year, and in 1895-96 the number of operations done exceeded those done in 1894-95 by 11,423, and during the year, 71.28 per 1,000 of the population of the district were successfully vaccinated. These results show that Surgeon-Lieutenant- Colonel Borah continues to take much interest in vaccination work. In the Manipur State, 5,633 more operations were done than in the previous year. The Civil Surgeon states that a good deal of work was done in villages on the Burmese frontier which had never been visited before. In the Kamrup district, 6,603 more vaccinations were done in 1894-95 than in 1893-94, and in 1895-96 there was a substantial increase of 3,505 above the number done in 1894-95. In the Darrang district, there were 3,430 more vaccinations done than in 1894-95, but there were 8,321 more vaccinations done in that district in 1892-93 than in the year under review. Districts in which the greatest decrease occurred. 11. There were 3,249 fewer vaccinations performed in the Naga Hills district than in the previous year. The Civil Surgeon states that the decrease was partly due to a considerable portion of the work having been done in the less accessible portions of the district and partly to the fact that the dread of small-pox is passing off, and Nagas are again beginning to refuse to allow their children to be vaccinated.. In the Khasi and Jaintia Hills there were 946 fewer operations done than in the previous year. The Civil Surgeon states that the decrease was due to the Inspector having been kept at headquarters during the first half of the season in order to give assistance at the lymph depôt so that, during that period, he was unable to push on the work in the interior of the district. There were 864 fewer vaccinations done in the Garo Hills district than in 1894-95, due, the Civil Medical Officer states, to the work having been commenced a month later than in the previous year. The first supply of lymph was sent from the Shillong depôt to the Garo Hills at the same time as the first supplies were sent to other districts in the province. Primary vaccinations done suc- cessfully at different age periods. 12. Including the work done by the dispensary establishment, there were 47,176 infants under one year of age, 131,507 children between the ages of one and six years, and 52,822 persons over six years of age, successfully vaccinated for the first time, as against 40,082 infants, 90,464 children between the ages of one and six years, and 34,968 persons above six years of age successfully vaccinated during 1894-95. Percentages found successful by inspecting officers. 13. Statement No. V gives the particulars of vaccinations verified by, inspecting officers. Of the 244,268 vaccinations done during the year by all agencies, with the exception of tea-garden agencies on tea gardens, 29,886 were inspected by Civil Surgeons and 158,915 by Native Inspectors of Vaccination. Civil Surgeons found that 29,045 of the vaccinations inspected by them were successful, a percentage of 97.19. Of the vaccinations inspected by Native Inspectors, 155,660, or 97.95 per cent., were found to be successful. The percentages found successful by Civil Surgeons and Native Inspectors coincided very closely with the results given by vaccinators, who reported that 97.74 of the primary vaccinations done by them were successful. During 1894-95 Civil Surgeons inspected 13,541 and Native Inspectors 120,796 vaccinations, so that Civil Surgeons inspected 16,345 and Native Inspectors 38,119 more vaccinations than in the previous year. As in 1894-95, the largest number of inspections was made by Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel Borah, the Civil Surgeon of Sibsagar, who examined 8,300 vaccinations, being 24.92 per cent. of the total number vaccinated. The Civil Surgeons of Sylhet and Goalpara inspected, respectively, 4,547 and 3,647 vaccinations. Seeing that the Civil Surgeon of Manipur holds the Civil Surgeoncy as a collateral charge, a creditable amount of inspection work was done by him. The inspections made by the Civil Surgeons of Nowgong, Kamrup, Darrang
5 and Cachar were disappointingly small. The Civil Surgeon of Shillong inspected only 270 vaccinations. In order that he might devote as much time as possible to the lymph depôt, I requested him not to leave Shillong during the vaccinating season. The seven Inspectors of the Sylhet district examined 55,137 vaccinations. The very large number of 31,295 vaccinations was inspected by the Native Inspector of the Sibsagar district. In the districts in the plains the smallest number of inspections were made by the Native Inspectors of the Cachar, Goalpara and Nowgong districts. Percentage of work of licensed vaccinators found successful. 14. The percentages of vaccinations done by licensed vaccinators found to be successful, after inspection, are given in the following table: Table showing the number of licensed vaccinators' operations inspected by the Civil Surgeons and Native Inspectors during the year 1895-96.

The number of vaccinations found to be successful by Civil Surgeons and Native Inspectors were 4,157 and 14,466, respectively, so that Civil Surgeons found that 97.60 and Native Inspectors that 97.43 per cent. of the operations inspected by them were successful. These percentages are very similar to the percentage of primary vaccinations found by inspecting officers to be successful in the province generally. The table also shows that 57 per cent. of the work done by licensed vaccinators during the year was inspected; 42 per cent. of the work done by licensed vaccinators during 1894-95 was inspected by Civil Surgeons and Native Inspectors.

Sylhet 7 The Compulsory Vaccination Act, V of 1880, was brought into force in the station and Act XIII of 1880 in the cantonment of Shillong on the 21st of June 1895. There are at present ten places in which the Compulsory Acts are in force, the aggregate population of which was 68,847 when the census was taken in 1891. In these ten places there were 4,161 vaccinations done during the year, and 3,828 of the operations were successful. During 1894-95, 2,523 successful vaccinations were done in the nine places, with a population of 62,127, in which the Acts were then in force. During 1895, there were 132 deaths from small-pox registered in the ten places in which the Acts were in force, the death-rate having been 1.92 per 1,000. Of the 132 deaths from this cause, 115 were registered in Dibrugarh. The small-pox death-rate of the province as a whole for the year was 0.77 per 1,000. There were 779 notices issued under the Acts during the year, 73 prosecutions were instituted and 10 persons were punished. In 1894-95, 673 notices were issued and there were 47 prosecutions, but no one was punished. Silchar Municipality. 16. There were 181 vaccinations done in this municipality during the year with a successful result in each case. In 1894-95, 86 persons were successfully vaccinated. There were seven notices issued under the Act, and there was one prosecution, but no one was punished. Five small-pox deaths were registered during 1895. Sylhet Municipality. 17. There were 478 persons vaccinated in this municipality during the year, and 442 of these were operated on successfully. In 1894-95, 236 persons were successfully vaccinated. There were 435 notices issued under the Act, but not a single prosecution was instituted. Not a single small-pox death was registered in the municipality during the year. Dhubri Municipality. 18. Only 146 persons were vaccinated during the year, as against 573 in 1894-95. There were no notices issued under the Act, and no deaths from small-pox were registered during the year. Goalpara Municipality. 19. There were 169 persons successfully vaccinated in this municipality, as against 120 vaccinated successfully in 1894-95. One small-pox death was registered during 1895. There were 87 notices issued under the Act, 6 prosecutions were instituted and one person was punished. Gauhati Municipality. 20. In this municipality 572 persons were successfully vaccinated, as against 364 in 1894-95. No notices were issued under the Act. There were two deaths from small-pox registered during the year. Dibrugarh Municipality and Cantonment. 21. The large number of 1,287 persons were successfully vaccinated during the year, as against 829 in 1894-95. Three persons suffering from small-pox were landed at Dibrugarh in February from a steamer which had recently left Calcutta, and from that date to the end of the year the disease was prevalent, causing 115 deaths in the munici- pality and cantonment. There were 250 notices issued under the Act, 66 prosecutions were instituted and 9 persons were punished. Sibsagar Station. 22. There were 394 persons successfully vaccinated in this station, as against 303 in 1894-95. No notices were issued under the Act. Seven deaths from small-pox were registered in the station during the year. Shillong Station and Cantonment. 23. Out of 438 persons vaccinated during the year, 387 were done successfully. There were no notices issued under the Act, which was brought into force on the 21st of June. Not a single small- pox death was registered during the year. Golaghat Union. 24. There were 104 persons successfully vaccinated in this union during the year. No notices were issued under the Act. Two small-pox deaths were registered during the year. Jorhat Union. 25. In this union 158 persons were successfully vaccinated, as against 115 in 1894-95. No notices were issued under the Act, and not a single death was registered from small-pox. Inoculation. 26. Inoculation continues to be frequently practised in the Surma Valley. The Civil Medical Officer of Cachar stated that an outbreak of small-pox, originating directly from inoculation, occurred in a village near Jhaffirband tea garden in the Hailakandi subdivision, and that the disease afterwards spread to that tea garden. He also reported that inoculation was
8 the cause of an outbreak of small-pox which occurred at Udarband Bazar, and that the disease afterwards appeared in the neighbouring Urunaband tea garden. In May 1895, two persons were charged in the Court of the Deputy Commissioner of Cachar, the one for causing death by a rash and negligent act in having inoculated a child who con- tracted small-pox and died, the other for doing a negligent act, likely to spread infection of a disease dangerous to life, in having inoculated certain children, one of whom contracted small-pox and lost his eyesight. They were each sentenced to a week's imprisonment and a fine of twenty rupees. On appeal to the Sessions Judge at Sylhet the term of imprisonment was remitted in each case, but the fines were allowed to stand. The Civil Surgeon of Sylhet stated that inoculation was carried on, to some extent, in all the subdivisions of that district during the year. The Civil Surgeon of Lakhimpur stated that, without doubt, inoculation is still practised among the Assamese of that district. The Civil Surgeons of all the other districts in the province reported that there was no evidence that inoculation was practised in their districts during the year. Mortality from small-pox com- pared, district by district, with the amount of protection afforded by successful vaccination. 27. The accompanying diagram has been prepared in accordance with orders conveyed in Government of India, Home Department, letter No. 49, dated the 8th February 1894, in order to compare the death-rates from small-pox registered in 1895, district by district, with the amount of protection afforded by successful vaccinations done during the seven years 1889-90 to 1895-96.

9 As noted in former reports there appears to be little relation between the death- rates from small-pox in the several districts, and the amount of protection afforded in them by successful vaccination. The proportion of the population protected by success- ful vaccination is comparatively small. As means of communication in the interior of districts in this province are comparatively difficult, small-pox is frequently not seen in the remoter portions of districts for several years in succession, and, when the disease is afterwards introduced into these tracts, very severe outbreaks occur. Animal Lymph Depôt at Shillong. 28. The Annual Report of the Bovine Lymph Depôt at Shillong, by Surgeon- Captain Carroll, is given as Appendix A to this Report. Including the amount debited to the Manipur State, the expenditure on the depôt during the year amounted to Rs. 7,217-3-11, an increase of Rs. 113-1-11 on Rs. 7,104-2-0, the amount spent on the depôt during the previous year. The expenditure would have been somewhat smaller than it was in 1894- 95 if a new pump had not been supplied at a cost of Rs. 147, and if capillary tubes had not cost Rs. 261 more than they did in the previous year. There were 239,386 tubes loaded, as against 250,249 loaded in the previous year. In the eleventh paragraph of his Report, Dr. Carroll gives the number of loaded tubes supplied weekly to Civil Surgeons. The Civil Surgeon of Sylhet received, on an average, 500 tubes and the Civil Surgeon of Kamrup 2,000 tubes weekly ; and the returns show that 75,712 persons were vaccin- ated in the Sylhet and 29,818 in the Kamrup district. As only 11,500 loaded tubes were received by the Civil Surgeon of Sylhet, the method of arm-to-arm vaccination must have been extensively resorted to in that district. Dr. Carroll observes that vaccinations done by lanoline paste in the Khasi and Jaintia Hills gave excellent results, and he states that if lanoline paste was substituted for glycerine lymph, the expenditure incurred would be little more than one-half of the present expenditure. After making experiments in 1892, Dr. Campbell came to the conclusion that glycerine lymph was more efficient than lanoline paste. A supply of lanoline paste might be sent to selected Civil Surgeons next vaccinating season for favour of report after vaccinations have been done with it under their personal supervision. All Civil Surgeons have reported that the vaccine lymph supplied by the Shillong depôt during the season 1895- 96 was of excellent quality. I inspected a considerable number of vaccinations in almost all the places which I visited during my cold-weather tour, and found that the results were in almost every case very satisfactory. Much credit is due to Surgeon-Captain Carroll for the very efficient manner in which he supervised the depôt during the year. He reports very favourably on the manner in which Hospital Assistant Chandra Nath Chand, who was in subordinate charge, performed his duties. Vaccination with fresh calf lymph. 29. The results obtained during the past season from lymph preserved in glycerine at the Shillong depôt have been quite as good as those- which are obtained when fresh lymph of good quality is used. It is, however, not always possible to prepare a sufficient supply of efficient lymph at the depôt, in consequence of epidemic disease occurring occasionally among calves and for other reasons, and it is, therefore, advisable to arrange to have an independent source of supply. The Chief Commissioner has accordingly directed that arrangements be made with a view to adopting next season the method of vaccinating with fresh calf lymph at the headquarters stations of districts. Instructions issued with a view to obtaining efficient vaccination. 30. A copy of two circulars which were issued to Civil Surgeons, containing measures which should be taken to obtain efficient vaccin- ation, is given in Appendix B to this Report. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient Servant, A. STEPHEN, M.B., Surgeon-Colonel, Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam D

13 A.14 A.15 B.16 Comparative Statement No. IV.17 Statement No. V.18 APPENDIX A. Annual Report of the Bovine Vaccine Depôts Shillong, for the year 1895-96. Total expenditure. 1. The total expenditure during the year was Rs. 6,544-10-5, being Rs. 270-7-7 less than last year. The diminution would have been much greater but for the following reasons:19 The causes of this considerable mortality were the change to the cold climate of these hills, combined, in many cases, with the great activity of the lymph with which they were vaccinated, which caused them to 'take' very freely. Expenditure on calves. 5. The net expenditure on calves was Rs. 2,639, while in the preceding year it was Rs. 3,150. Cost of feeding. 6. The cost of the calves' food was Rs. 284-5-6, compared with Rs. 381-13 in 1894-95. Miscellaneous. 7. The expenditure under this head was Rs. 2,076-6-8, while in the year before it was Rs. 1,817-8-8. Of this amount, vaccine tubes cost Rs. 1,686-13-1, service stamps and telegrams, Rs. 51-6 and contingencies, Rs. 338-3-7. In 1894-95 vaccine tubes cost Rs. 1,425-0-3, service stamps and telegrams, Rs. 51-4, and contingencies, Rs. 341-4-5. Establishment. 8. The establishment consists of a second-grade hospital assistant, with a special allowance of Rs. 20 a month, a clerk at Rs. 10, a loader at Rs. 12, a coolie at Rs. 10, and a coolie and sweeper at Rs. 10 each, engaged for seven months only. An additional coolie at Rs. 10 is paid for by Manipur. The cost was20 Statement of net Expenditure incurred during the year 1895-96. 21 APPENDIX B. Measures for obtaining efficient Vaccination. Circular No. 5S., dated Shillong, the 11th September 1895. FromASSAM SECRETARIAT PRINTING OFFICE (GENERAL) No. 97Resolution on the Vaccination Report for 1895-96. Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner of Assam in the General Department, No. 4387 G., dated the 7th July 1896. Read 2 credit is due to the Civil Surgeons of these districts for their successful management of vaccination work. The increase of 5,633 in the Manipur State, which has at times suffered severely from visitations of small-pox, is highly satisfactory. The results in Darrang showed an improvement, as compared with the results of the previous year, but the figures are still far below those reported in 1892-93. Statement No. IV in the Appendix to the Report furnishes an interesting retrospect of the progress of vaccination in Assam by all agencies during the past decade. From this statement it will be seen that in 1886-87 there were 128,262 primary vaccinations, of which 117,310 were successful. In 1891-92 the figures were 197,572 and 184,225, respectively. In 1894-95, 195,703 primary vaccinations were recorded, of which 169,971, or 86.9 per cent., were successful, while during the year under review there were 253,641 vaccinations, of which 245,839, or 96.9, were successful. The high percentage obtained in the year under review is an indication of the great improvement in the quality of the lymph supplied from the Shillong Bovine Lymph Depôt, and the results reflect great credit on Surgeon-Captain Carroll, who was in charge of the depôt throughout the year. Details of the work done at the depôt are given in Appendix A to the Report. The Chief Commissioner approves of the proposal made by Dr. Stephen in paragraph 28 of the Report, that experiments should be made next cold weather, with a view to testing the efficacy of lanoline paste as a means of preserving the lymph, this paste being considerably cheaper than glycerine, which is at present used for the purpose. In paragraph 29 of the Report, the Principal Medical Officer has pointed out the neces- sity of having an independent source of lymph supply, and he has referred to the arrange- ments which have recently been sanctioned by the Chief Commissioner for vaccinating with fresh calf lymph at the headquarters of districts. No reference is made in the Report to the method of vaccinating with human lymph ; the Report for 1896-97 may usefully notice to what extent arm-to-arm vaccination is still practised, and compare the results of the same with those obtained where animal vaccine is used. 4. The inspection work done by Civil Surgeons and Native inspectors is summarised in Statement No. V of the Appendix. Of the total number of 244,268 persons vaccinated, 29,886 were inspected by Civil Surgeons and 159,915 by Native inspectors, the corre- sponding figures for the previous year being 193,779, 13,541, and 120,796, respectively. These figures show a marked improvement. Of the total number of cases inspected, 97.19 per cent. were found by Civil Surgeons, and 97.95 per cent. by Native inspectors, to be successful. 5. The Compulsory Vaccination Act, V (B.C.) of 1880, was extended during the year to the station of Shillong, and Act XIII of 1880 was at the same time brought into force in the Shillong Cantonment. The total number of deaths from small-pox in towns in which Compulsory Vaccination Acts are in force, was 132, against 49 registered in the previous year, the death-rate in the ten towns to which one or other of the Acts has been extended, having been 1.92 per 1,000, compared with a provincial death-rate of 0.77 per 1,000. Of the 132 deaths, 115 were registered in Dibrugarh alone. The number of persons successfully vaccinated in towns rose from 2,523 in 1894-95 to 3,828 in 1895-96. No generalisations can be made in comparing areas under compulsory vaccination with the rest of the Province ; the total population in the areas where vacci- nation is compulsory is rather less than 69,000, and local conditions differ greatly between the towns in which this population is found and the rural areas where vaccination is not enforced by law.
