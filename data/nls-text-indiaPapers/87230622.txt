TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE UNITED PROVINCES OF AGRA AND OUDH FOR THE YEARS 1920-21, 1921-22, AND 1922-23. Period covered by the-report. THIS report covers the triennial period 1920-21 to 1922-23, but deals especially with the work of the year 1922 -23, as brief notes have already been submitted on the work of the preceding two years. Area and population. 2. During the triennial period under review the census enumeration was taken in 1921, according to which the area of the Province excluding the States of Rampur, Benares, and Tehri-Garhwal is 107,167 square miles and the population 45,375,787. Officers in charge of the department. 3. I held charge of the office of Superintendent General of Vaccination, United Provinces, during the triennial period under report except for the periods from 29th April, 1920 to 18th November, 1920 and from 16th May, 1922 to 30th November, 1922, during. which Rai Bahadur Dr. D. D. Pandya, the then Deputy Sanitary Commissioner (now Assistant Director of Public Health), IV Range, and Major W. A. Mearns, I.M.S., Assistant Director of Public Health, I Range, remained in charge, respectively. Constitution and strength of the depart- ment. (Statement II.) 4. The charge of the several ranges was held by the following officers during the triennium under report:( 2 ) Dr. K. C. Dube, D.P.H., from 19th November, 1920 to 1st November. 1921. Dr. K. P. Mathur, D.P.H., from 2nd November, 1921 to 1st August, 1922. IV RANGE. Rai Bahadur Dr. D. D. Pandya, D.P.H., from 1st April, 1920 to 28th April, 1920 and from 19th November, 1920 to 1st November, 1921. Dr. K. C. Dube, D.P.H., from 29th April, 1920 to 18th November, 1920 and from 2nd November, 1921 to 2nd August, 1922. Dr. K. P. Mathur, D.P.H., from 3rd August, 1922 to 26th November, 1922 and from 27th December, 1922 to 31st March, 1923. Dr. A. Sousa, D.P.H., from 27th November, 1922 to 26th December, 1922. The number of Assistant Superintendents of Vaccination (49) remained unaltered, but that of vaccinators was 909 in 1922-23 as against 911 in 1921-22 and 916 in the year preceding. During the triennuim under report a circular letter was isssued to all the district boards, suggesting an incrense in the pay of the vaccination staff on the basis of the scale laid down by Government for Government servants. Copies of the circular were sent to all the other local bodies employing vaccinators. With one or two exceptions, the suggestion was taken up favourably by the local bodies concerned. In 1921, Government raised the amount of the horse allowance given to Assistant Superintendents of Vaccination from Rs. 15 to Rs. 20 per mensem. During the triennium Government also sanctioned the change in the titles of the department and its officers. The Sanitation department was designated &quot;Public Health department,&quot; &quot; Sanitary Commissioner,&quot; Director of Public Health,&quot; and &quot; Deputy Sanitary Commissioners,&quot; &quot; Assistant Directors of Public Health.&quot; The headquarters of the four As- sistant, Directors of Public Health on general duty were also changed as noted below with a view to facilitating the administration of the depart. ment: ( 3 ) Average cost of each successful case of vacci- nation. (Statement II) 6. The average cost per successful operation was annas four and pies ten during the year under report as compared with annas five and pics two for the previous year and annas three and pies four for 1920-21. The average for the triennium under report was annas four and pies five as compared with annas two and pies five for the preced- ing triennium. The increase in cost has been accounted for above. Besides this it is more apparent than real, as the cost has been calculated on a comparatively smaller number of vaccinations performed during the triennium under report. In the table below, the cost per successful case of vaccination in these provinces for the three years under review is compared with that of other Indian provinces :( 4 ) during the triennium under review as compared with the previous corre- sponding period is shown in the table appended below :( 5 ) followed by Bahraich with 3,722 and Sitapur with 3,696. The worst districts indicating a fall were Benares with a decrease of 4,252, Far. rukhabad with 2,958, Mainpuri with 2,322, and Azamgarh with 2,182, The districts of Basti, Sitapur, Gorakhpur, and Moradabad which reported a decrease last year have shown a satisfactory increase. In Benares the decrease is accounted for by the low birth-rate and the prevalence of plague in epidemic form. In Farrukhabad it is attributed to the following causes :( 6 ) in proportion to births in the first range has been the highest for the several years past as compared with other ranges but in the year under report the percentage of the 3rd range exceeded that of the 1st range by .07. Mortality from small- pox. 11. The mortality from small-pox fell from .13 in 1920 and .03 in 1921 to .01 in 1922, the number of deaths during the three years being 6,354, 1,439, and 242, respec- tively. The quinquennial average was .10. Diagram. 12. A diagram showing the relation between the mortality from small- pox and the proportion of the population protected by vaccination in each district is attached. Dispensary vaccina- tion. (Statement III ) 13. An increase of 170 is noticed in the number of vaccinations per- formed at dispensaries in 1922-23 as compared with last year, but a decrease of 166 as compared with the year 1920-21, the actual figures for the three years being 420 (300 primary and 120 re-vaccinations), 250 and 576, respectively. The average for the triennium under report was 415 against 449 for the preceding triennium. Vaccination in muni- cipalities. 14. The total number of persons vaccinated in municipalities in 1922-23 was 101,815, that of vaccination opera- tions performed 103,646 (91,751 primary and 11 ,895 re-vaccinations), that of successful primary operations 85,729 and that of successful re-vaccinations 6,538 as against 97,994, 100,379, 82,881, 5,564 in 1921-22 and 106,513, 107,904, 86,987, and 7,895 in 1920-21. respectively. The number of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population in 1922-23 was 31.72 as compared with 30.39 in last year and 32.12 in the year before last. Among the well protected municipalities Almora wilh 142.81 persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of the population heads the list, and is followed by Naini Tal with 69.47, Etah with 57.73, Gonda with 52.54, Unao with 51.40, and Bahraich with 49.03. The muncipalities showing a low degree of protection were Rae Bareli (17.86), Nagina (17.93), Far- rukhabad (17.98), Tanda (18.61) and Kanauj 20.32. The decrease in Rae Bareli is attributed to the fact that many children left the municipality during the vaccination season and in Nagina to the appointment of a new and inexperienced man. In Tanda it is stated to be due to the prevalence of plague and cholera, while in Farrukhabad and Kanauj it is ascribed to non-receipt of lymph from the Government Bovine Lymph Dépôt, Patwa Dangar, for three consecutive weeks in January and February. The statement showing the number of successful vaccinations per- formed on children under one year of age in different municipalities forms appendix B to this report. Vaccination in can- tonments. 15. The total number of persons vaccinated in the cantonments of these provinces in 1922-23 was 8,840, of vaccina- tions operations 9,017 (5,352 primary and 3,665 re-vaccinations) of successful primary 4,884 and of successful re-vaccinations 2,485 as compared with 8,764, 8,775, 4,686, and 2,212 in last year and 11,516, 11,527, 5,713, and 3,579 in the year before last. The figures for the year under report show an increase over those for 1921-22 but a decrease as compared with those for 1920-21.
( 7 ) Vaccination in noti- fied areas. 16. In 1922-23 the total number of persons vaccinated in the notified areas, the number of operations performed, and the number of successful vaccinations were, respectively 11,771. 11,922, and 11,130 as compared with 10,792, 10,910. and 10,313 in 1921-22 and 13,399, 13,590, and 12,572 in 1920-21. The number of persons sucessfully vaccinated per 1 ,000 of population in 1922-23 was 32.46 as compared with 31.59 in 1921-22 and 37.72 in 1920-21. Among the notified areas showing the largest protection afforded against small-pox Shahganj (Jaunpur) stands first with a rate of 135.02, followed by Mainpuri Civil Station with 132.34, Bhim Tal with 59.84, Chunar and Chunar Settlement (Mirzapur) with 47.27, Rath (Hamirpur) with 42.15, and Fatehpur Sikri (Agra) with 40.21. Among the notified areas showing the least protection were Rikhikesh in the Dehra Dun district (2.04), Ramnagar in the Naini Tal district (17.62), Bilgram in the Hardoi district (18.11), Moghal Sarai in the Benares district (18.93) Auraiya in the Etawah district (19.78). Ramnagar shows a slight improvement over last year. The decrease in Bilgram, Rikhikesh, Moghal Sarai and Auraiya is stated to be due to low bath-rate. Vaccination Act. 17. The Vaccination Act is in force in all the cantonments, in 84 out of 85 municipalities and 46 cut of 48 notified areas. Steps are being taken to extend the Act to the municipality of Baraut and the notified areas of Rikhikesh (Dehra Dun) and Ganj Dundwara (Etah). The proposal to extend the Vaccination Act to the rural areas is under the consideration of Government. General results of in- spection. (Statement V). 18. (a) By Assistant Directors of Public Health and District Superintendents of Vaccination( 8 ) The districts showing a large number of vaccination inspections in 1922-23 are Jaunpur (13,054), Gorakhpur (11,488), Bulandshahr (7,435), Basti (6,511), Pilibhit (6,202), and Bijnor (6,167). Among the districts in which the smallest number of vaccinations was inspected the most conspicuous are Garhwal (294), Almora (530), Luck- now (870), Naini Tal (1,409), and Saharanpur (1,412). The percentage of inspections to total number vaccinated was 15.04 in the case of primary and 2.17 in the case of re-vaccinations in 1922-23 as against 13.45 and 1.94 in 1921-22 and 11.42 and 4.52 in 1920-21. (b) By Assistant Superintendents of Vaccination and other inspect- ing officers.( 9 ) During the year 1922-23, 332 (85 cow and 247 buffalo) calves were purchased or obtained on fee as compared with 469 in 1921-22 and 504 in 1920-21. Of 332 calves 298 were successfully vaccinated, three failed, 28 died before, and three after, vaccination. The total number of deaths among calves during the year was 138 as against 178 in 1921-22 and 109 in 1920-21. Of the 138 deaths, 131 were due to pleuro-pneumonia and seven to other causes. The total quantity of crude lymph obtained from 298 calves success- fully vaccinated during the year under report amounted to 15,097.5 grammes( 10 ) 69,436.75 grammes in metal collapsible tubes, 331,668, capillary tubes, and 5 grammes of glycerine paste sufficient to vaccinate 2,067,712 persons were issued during 1922-23 against 87,093.75 grammes of metal tubes, 135,448 capillary tubes and 6 grammes of glycerine paste in 1921-22, and 89,609.25 grammes in metal tubes, 137,633 capillary tubes, 14 grammes of glyecrine paste and 4 grammes of lanoline paste in 1920-21. Of the total quantity of lymph issued 153 capillary tubes and 75.25 grammes in bulk to the value of Rs. 55 were issued free during the year under report as compared with 660 capillary tubes and 75 grammes in bulk costing Rs 91 in 1921-22 and 1,443 capillary tubes and 126 grammes in bulk costing Rs. 131 in 1920-21. During the year under report 84 municipalities and 39 notified areas were supplied with lymph on payment. The municipality of Mainpuri and the notified areas of Shikohabad, Mainpuri Civil Station, Aonla, Auraiya, Sheopur, Moghal-Sarai, Chunar Settlement, Badshahpur and Madhoganj did not take lymph from the dépôt during the year under report. Lymph worth Rs. 22,126 was purchased by district boards, Rs. 5,868 by municipalities, Rs. 4,947 by the States, Rs. 1,043 by notified areas, Rs. 882 by private persons and value payable post and Rs. 483 by cantonments, as compared with Rs. 19,578, Rs. 6,308, Rs. 4,781, Rs. 991, Rs. 1,129, and Rs. 619 in 1921-22 and Rs. 19,889, Rs. 4,394, Rs. 3,527, Rs.800, Rs. 1,038, and Rs. 376 in 1920-21, respectively. Lymph to the value of Rs. 1,104 was supplied to the Military department in 1922-23, against Rs. 1,536 in 1921-22 and Rs. 2,064 in the year preceding, on an annual contract of Rs. 3,000. From 1913-14 to 1922-23 lymph to the total value of Rs. 19,015 was supplied to the Military department, while the total amount received from them amounted to Rs. 16,300, leaving the dépôt at a loss of Rs. 2,715. During the year under report the total receipts of the dépôt amounted to Rs. 41,354 (Rs. 38,349 from the sale of lymph and Rs. 3,005 from that of miscellaneous articles) against Rs 39,170 in 1921-22 and Rs. 37,144 in the year before. The expenditure of the dépôt in 1922-23 was Rs. 35,138 as compared with Rs. 33,259 in 1921-22 and Rs. 39,217 in 1920-21. The increase in cost is accounted for by the fact that a sum of Rs. 2,322 was spent on the purchase of new plates (positive and negative) for electric battery. It is however gratifying to note that the dépôt) worked at a profit of Rs. 6,216 and has in stock lymph worth Rs. 68,615 for next year. There is about 20 months' supply in hand. As, however, we only aim at keeping one year's supply in hand, only 50,000 grammes of lymph will be manufactured in the current year which will ensure a considerable saving to Government during 1923-24. During the year under report 1,236,903 operations (1,174,008 primary and 62,895 re-vaccinations) were performed with the calf lymph issued from the Government Bovine Lymph dépôt, Patwa Dangar, as compared with 1,219,802 in the last year and 1,356,405 in the year before last.
( 11 ) The results of vaccination performed during the year under report and the preceding two years are given in the table appended below :( 12 ) On the recommendation of the representative of the Tudor Company (Messrs. Balmer Lawrie & Co.) new plates (positive and negative; have been purchased and will be fitted during the ensuing year. An electrician has been appointed in place of the head mistri and Government has sanctioned the change of the designation from head mistri to electrician. The calf shed to bo used as a veterinary hospital has now been com- pleted and a grain godown, an oil godown, a store room, and mistri's work- shop are under construction. The estimates for the construction of several other buildings have been finally passed by Governrnent but funds have not yet been allotted. Captain E. H. Morbey, Superintendent of the dépôt, has again carried out his duties most satisfactorily, the dépôt being in excellent order and the establishment having worked under his orders regularly and well. I again bring his services to the notice of Government for recognition of the excellent work done by him during the last 3½ years, Improvements in the department. 20.

[Prescribed maximum lengthNOTES ON VACCINATION IN THE UNITED PROVINCES FOR THE YEAR 1923-24. Brief notes on Vacci- nation in 1923 24. A detailed report for the triennium 1920-21, 1921-22 and 1922-23 having been submitted last year, this report deals briefly with vaccination in 1923-24 as compared with 1922-23. Area and popula- tion. 2. The area of the province excluding the estates of Rampur, Benares and Tehri-Garhwal was 107,167 square miles and the population 45,375,787. Constitution and strength of the depart- ment. (Statement II.) 3. I held charge of the office of the Superin- tendent-General of Vaccination throughout the year. The following officers were in charge of the several ranges during the year under review :( 2 ) provinces during the year under report as compared with other provinces :( 3 ) The causes of the decrease in these districts were :( 4 ) Dispensary vaccina- tion. (Statement III.) 12. In 1923-24, 512 vaccination operations (215 primary and 297 re- vaccination) were performed by medical subordi- nates at dispensaries as against 420 in 1922-23. Vaccination in municipalities. 13. There was an increase in the vaccination work performed in municipalities during the year under review as compared with the preceding year, the total number of persons vaccinated being 107,045 and 101,815 and that of vaccination operations 112,863 (100,896 primary and 11,967 re-vaccination) and 103,646 (91,751 primary and 11,895 re-vaccination) respectively. The number of successful primary vaccinations and that of successful re-vaccinations amounted to 87,498 and 4,786 in 1923-24 as against 85,729 and 6,538 in 1922-23 respectively. The ratio of persons successfully vaccinated per mille of the population in 1923-24 was prac- tically the same as in 1922-23, the figures for the two years being 31.73 and 31.72 respectively. Among the municipalities showing a large num- ber of persons successfully vaccinated per mille of the population Etah and Gonda which stood third and fourth last year are first and second this year with a ratio of 68.25 and 56.47 respectively. Then came Mussoorie with 51.44, Unao with 48.08 and Konch with 43.44. The municipalities in which the least protection has been noticed are Mainpuri (12.75), Rae Bareli (17.92), Kanauj (19.61), Azamgarh (20.22) and Farrukhabad-cum- Fatehgarh (20.59). Farrukhabad-cum-Fatehgarh and Rae Bareli show an improvement over last year, while Kanauj is gone worse this year. In Mainpuri the decrease is ascribed by the District Superintendent of Vaccination to a smaller number of re-vaccinations being performed this year. In Azamgarh it is attributed to the supply of lymph of poor quality. Appendix B to these notes will show the number of success- ful vaccinations performed on children under the age of one year in different municipalities during the year under review. Vaccination in can- tonments. 14. In 1923-24, 10,988 persons were vaccinated and 11,162 opera- tions (5,661 primary and 5.501 re-vaccination) performed by the regular vaccination staff in can- tonments of these provinces against 8 840 and 9,017 (5,352 primary and 3,665 re-vaccination) respectively in the preced- ing year. The number of successful primary vaccinations and successful re-vaccinations during the two years were 4,928 and 2,719 and 4,884 and 2,485 respectively. The number of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population was 38.23 in 1923-24 as against 36.84 in 1922-23. An examination of the above figures will show an increase under all heads. In 1923 it was brought to my notice that the returns of vaccination operations performed by military medical officers in cantonments were not received by District Superintendents of Vaccination and were not included in the district returns. I accordingly addressed the Deputy Director of Medical Services, Eastern Command, on the subject who did not agree to furnish the information on the form in use in this depart- ment, but issued instructions to the military officers concerned to send half- yearly vaccination returns to my office on the form prescribed by the Army department. These returns show that military medical officers performed 16,705 vaccination operations (531 primary and 16,174 re-vaccination)
( 5 ) during the year under report. Of these the number of successful primary vaccinations was 336 and that of successful re-vaccinations 5,679. As the returns received from military authorities do not contain all the information required for our standard statements, the statistics contained therein cannot be included in any of the statements appended to these notes. Vaccination in notified areas. 15. The number of persons vaccinated and that of vaccination opera- tions performed in the notified areas in 1923-24 were 11,841 and 12,209 respectively, as compared with 11,771 and 11,922 respectively in 1922-23. Of the 12,209 operations performed 11,776 were primary and 433 re- vaccinations, as compared with 11,388 and 534 respectively in the preced- ing year. The total number of successful primary vaccinations amounted to 10,544 and that of successful re-vaccinations to 189 in 1923-24 as against 10,826 and 304 respectively in the previous year. The number of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of the population was 31.62 in 1923-24 as against 32.46 in 1922-23. Of the well protected notified areas, Shahganj (Jaunpur), Mainpuri Civil Station and Bhimtal (Naini Tal) retained their last year's position as first, second and third with a ratio of 62.11, 56.50 and 49.97 respectively. Then came Bhinga (Bah- raich) with 49.75 and Badshahpur (Jaunpur) with 46.92. Among the notified areas showing the least protection, the most conspicuous are Shikohabad in the Mainpuri district (10.99), Auraiya in the Etawah district (12.36), Bhowali in the Naini Tal district (19.10), Mubarakpur in the Azamgarh district (19.12) and Deoria in the Gorakhpur district (19.90). Auraiya went three steps down this year as compared with the previous year. The decrease in Auraiya is due to an outbreak of plague. In Bhowali it is assigned to the fact that a few children were left unvaccinated as they were not keeping good health. In Shikohabad, Mubarakpur and Deoria the decrease is ascribed to the supply of lymph of low potency in the earlier part of the season. Vaccination Act. 16. The Vaccination Act is in force in all cantonments and munici- palities and in 46 out of 48 notified areas. Steps are being taken to extend the Act to the notified areas of Rikhikesh (Dehra Dun) and Ganj Dundwara (Etah). The pro- posal to extend the Vaccination Act to rural areas has been shelved by Government for the present. General results of inspection. (Statement V.) 17. (a) By Assistant Directors of Public Health and District Superintendents of Vaccination.( 6 ) of the last Adh Kumbh fair, Allahabad, from November to February ; (2) Transfer of Major T. D. Murison, I.M.S., Assistant Director of Public Health, II Range, to Assam as Director of Public Health in November, 1923, and the post remaining vacant for about three months; and (3) Curtailment of tours of District Superintendents of Vaccina- tion. The largest number of inspections was done in the districts of Gorakh- pur (10,658). Azamgarh (8,868), Sultanpur (7,212), Bulandshahr (7,169), Jaunpur (6,572) and Bijnor (6,199). Of the districts in which the smallest number of inspections was performed the most conspicuous were Lucknow (123), Almora (143), Garhwal (238), Banda (897) and Naini Tal (942). All these districts have shown a further decline in the number of inspec- tions as compared with the previous year. In the case of Lucknow, however, the District Superintendent of Vaccination is not required to make vaccination tours. (b) By Assistant Superintendents of Vaccination and other inspect- ing officers.( 7 ) The number of calves purchased or obtained on fees during the year 1923-24 was 342 (64 cow and 278 buffalo) as compared with 332 (85 cow and 247 buffalo) in 1922-23. The disposal of 342 calves is given below :( 8 ) by calf lymph vaccination and the income and expenditure of the dépôt: ( 9 ) The question of revision of the contract amount is under considera- tion. The sale-proceeds of lymph from the dépôt in 1923-24 amounted to Rs. 35,216 and those of miscellaneous articles to Rs. 2,751, or a total of Rs. 37,967, as against Rs. 41,354 (Rs. 38,349 from sale of lymph and Rs. 3,005 from that of miscellaneous articles) in the preceding year. The decrease in the receipts from the sale of lymph is due to the issue of capillary tubes during the year being less than in the preceding year when a larger amount of capillary tubes had to be issued owing to the late receipt of collapsible tubes. The total expenditure incurred during the year under report was Rs. 36,602 as against Rs. 35,731 in the year before( 10 ) of a quantity of lymph which led to the destruction of all the lymph manufactured at that time. Lymph issued towards the end of the year was of good quality and high potency. The cold storage plant worked very satisfactorily during the year under report. 137,230.3 grammes of glycerinated lymph and 345.0 grammes of glycerine paste were kept in the cold storage last year for issue during 1923-24, out of which 31,667 grammes of lymph manufactured during the previous year were destroyed as lymph issued from this stock had been giving doubtful results. The remainder was issued during the hot weather and the first four months of the vaccination season. 88,266.0 grammes of glycerinated lymph and 375.0 grammes of glycerine paste have been manufactured and placed in the cold storage for issue during 1924-25. The lighting plant has worked satisfactorily during the year. The new plates (positive and negative) which were purchased during 1922-23 were fitted during the hot weather. The post of the electrician was made superior and permanent but non- pensionable. The staff of the dépôt carried out their duties satisfactorily. Captain E. H. Morbey, Superintendent of the dépôt, has again kept the dépôt) in excellent order and effected economies in many directions. I am glad that his valuable services have been recognised by Government by grant- ing him an increase in pay. District annual vaccination returns. 19. District annual vaccination returns were again received late from several districts and had to be returned for correc- tion. The attention of the District Superinten- dents of Vaccination concerned will be drawn to this. C. L.

Area and population. According to census of 1921 the area of the Province, excluding the States of Rampur, Benares and Tehri-Garh- wal, was 107,167 square miles and the population 45,375,787. Constitution and strength of the depart- ment. (Statement II.) 2. The charge of the office of the Superintendent-General of Vaccina- tion was held by Lieut.-Colonel C. L. Dunn, D.P.H., I.M S., throughout the year. The follow- ing officers were in charge of the several ranges during the year under report :( 2 ) Expenditure on vacci- nation. (Statement II.) 4. There was an increase of Rs. 11,032 in the total expenditure, excluding the charges on account of the Assistants Directors of Public Health and their establishments and a decrease of Rs. 1,096, including these charges as compared with 1923-24, the total during the two years being Rs. 3,98,376 and Rs. 3,87,344 and Rs. 4,61,492 and Rs. 4,62,588, respectively. The increase is due to the increased expenditure under the Government Bovine Lymph Dépôt, Patwa Dangar, and the vaccination staff. The decrease in expenditure under Assistant Directors of Public Health is due to the fact that the Assistant Directors of Public Health, 2nd and 3rd Ranges, were on leave ex-India for about six months. Average cost of each successful case of vaccination. (Statement II.) 5. The average cost of each successful case of vaccination in these Provinces during the year under report was nearly the same as in the preceding year. The figures for the two years were annas four and pies nine and annas four and pies ten, respectively. The follow- ing table shows the average cost of each successful case of vaccination in these Provinces during the year under report as compared with other provinces : ( 3 ) Each vaccinator vaccinated on an average 1,472 persons during the year under review as against 1,400 in the preceding year. The ratio of persons successfully vaccinated by the district staff was 26.68 per mille of the population as compared with 25.57 in 1923-24. It is gratifying to note that, like the preceding year, there was an increase under all heads during the year under report. Successful primary vaccinations in differ- ent districts. (Statement I.) 7. In 37 out of 48 districts the number of successful primary vaccina- tions performed in 1924-25 was in excess of that performed during the preceding year. Of these, Gorakhpur stood first with an increase of 4,925, followed by Azamgarh with 3,944, Farrukhabad with 3,853, Meerut with 3,791, Garhwal with 3,711, Bara Banki with 2,806, Allahabad with 2,739, Moradabad with 2,725, Agra with 2,669 and Etah with 2,365. Of the eleven districts showing a decrease the most conspicuous were Sultanpur (3,251), Jaunpur (2,611), Sitapur (2,264), Kheri (1,203) and Basti (950). The causes of decrease in these districts were( 4 ) Mortaity from small- pox. 10. The number of deaths registered from small-pox during 1924 were 2,724 against 747 of the previous year. The death- rates for the two years were .06 and .02, respectively, and the average for the past five years .08. Diagram. 11. A diagram showing the relation between the mortality from small- pox and the protection afforded by vaccination in each district is attached. Dispensary vaccina- tion. (Statement III.) 12. The total number of vaccination operations performed by medical subordinates at dispensaries during the year 1924-25 was 287 (216 primary and 71 re-vaccination) against 512 (215 primary and 297 re-vaccination) in 1923-24. Vaccination in muni- cipalities. 13. The vaccination work performed in municipalities during the year under report showed an increase as compared with that of the previous year, the total number of per- sons vaccinated being 115,177 and 107,045 and that of the vaccination operations performed 118,071 (101,517 primary and 16,554 re-evaccination) and 112,863 (100,896 primary and 11,967 re-vaccina- tion) respectively. The total number of successful vaccinations amounted to 91,909 in the case of primary vaccination and to 6,527 in that of re-vaccination during the year under review, as compared with 87,498 and 4,786 respectively, in 1923-24. The ratio of persons successfully vaccinated per mille of the population during the year under review was higher than the previous year, the figures for the two years being 33.88 and 31.73, respectively. Among the well-protected muni- cipalities Etah with 72.42 persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of the population heads the list, retaining its position of last year and is followed by Almora with 59.42, Gonda with 56.62, Naini Tal with 48.10, Lakhim- pur (Kheri) with 46.95 and Konch (Jalaun) with 45.37; Gonda and Konch, which stood second and fifth last year, are third and sixth this year. Among the least protected municipalities the most conspicuous are Main- puri (12.54), Ghaziabad (13.37), Dehra Dun (21.76), Rae Bareli (22.12), Farrukhabad (22.92) and Kanauj (23.39). Rae Bareli, Farrukhabad and Kanauj show an improvement over last year, while Ghaziabad and Dehra show a still greater decline this year. In Ghaziabad the decrease is ascribed by the District Superintendent of Vaccination to the improper maintenance of vaccination registers A and B by the municipality, with the result that a large number of children could not be traced for vaccination. In Dehra Dun it was due to the exclusion of some portion of the town from the municipal limits and to a smaller number of unvaccinated children of last year being available for vaccination. In Mainpuri it is ascribed to low birth-rate. The number of successful vaccinations performed on children under the age of one year in the municipalities during the year under report was 71,219 (vide Appendix B) against 69.579 in the previous year. Vaccination in can- tonments. 14. During the year under report 12,255 persons were vaccinated and 12,335 operations (5,483 primary and 6,852 re-vaccination) were performed by the vaccination staff in cantonments against 10,988 and 11,162 (5,661 primary and 5,501 re-vaccination), respectively, in the preceding year. The numbers of successful primary vaccinations and successful re-vaccinations during the two years were 4,995 and 4,117, and 4,928 and 2,719, respectively. The number of persons successfully vaccinated per
( 5 ) 1,000 of population was 44.20 in 1924-25 against 38.23 in 1923-24. Among the best protected cantonments, Cawnpore stands first with 165.00 followed by Almora with 112.38, Ranikhet with 102.70, Lucknow with 86.33 and Naini Tal with 84.72. The military medical officers in cantonments performed 20,786 opera- tions (451 primary and 20,335 re-vaccination) but of which 10,880 (236 primary and 10,644 re-vaccination) were successful. Vaccination in noti- fied areas. 15. The number of persons vaccinated and that of vaccination opera- tions performed in the notified areas during the year under report were 14,024 and 14,263 (12,405 primary and 1,858 re-vaccination) as compared with 11,841 and 12,209(11,776 primary and 433 re-vaccination), respectively, in the preceding year. The total number of successful primary vaccinations amounted to 11,585 and that of successful re-vaccination to 774 in 1924-25 against 10,544 and 189, respectively, in the previous year. The number of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of the population was 35.78 in 1924-25 as against 31.62 in 1923-24. Of the well protected notified areas Rajpur Notified Area stands first with a ratio of 128.03, followed by Chunar, Shahganj, Haldwani, and Gorakhpur with a ratio of 107.70, 84.90, 71.88, and 55.56, respectively. Shahganj, (Jaunpur) which stood first last year, stands third this year. Among the notified areas showing the least protection the most conspicuous are Bilgram in the Hardoi district (14.27), Karwi in the Banda district (14.75), Auraiya in the Etawah district (14.99), Kaimganj in the Farrukhabad district (20.18), Bhowali in the Naini Tal district (23.76). Auraiya and Bhowali show an improvement over last year. The decrease in Bilgram is due to the smaller number of births during the year as compared with the preceding year. In Karvi it is stated to be due to the effect of non-co-operation, while in Kaimganj to the imcompletences of registers of births and deaths and to notices issued having been returned unserved. Vaccination Act. 16. The Vaccination Act is in force in all municipalities and canton- ments and notified areas except in the notified areas of Rikhikesh (Dehra Dun) and Gunj-Dund- wara (Etah). Steps are being taken to extend the Act to these areas. General results of inspection. (Statement V.) 17.

From 1st April, 1925, the Military department have agreed to pay for the actual quantity of lymph supplied. The total value of lymph sold for the year 1924-25 amounted to Rs. 34,291 and that of miscellaneous articles Rs. 2,960 against Rs. 37,967 in 1923-24. The decrease is due to a smaller amount having been paid by the Military department for 1924-25 The sale-proceeds of lymph for the year could not, as usual, be realised in full before the close of the financial year. It is, however, hoped that in future the introduction of the contract system sanctioned in G. O. no. 4/XVI-143, dated the 3rd January, 1925, will result in prompt payments being made by local bodies. During the year under review the total expenditure of the dépôt amounted to Rs. 41,647 as against Rs. 36,014 in the preceding year, indicat- ing an increase of Rs. 5,633. The increase in expenditure is chiefly due to breakdown in the cold storage plant and engines during the hot weather as mentioned in a subsequent paragraph of this note. In addition to the direct expenditure incurred on setting the engines right the break- down was responsible for a large increase in the amount of ammonia used, there being a continual leakage till the advent of the cold weather. The engines also had to be run longer periods owing to the great loss in efficiency. Now that the engines and the cold storage plant are in thorough working order it is expected that the income for 1925-26 shall cover the recurring expenditure. The total number of vaccination operations performed with calf lymph supplied from the dépôt in 1924-25 amounted to 1,318,684 (1,243,750 pri- mary and 74,934 re-vaccinations) as compared with 1,309,636 in 1923-24. The following table shows the results of vaccination performed during the year under review as compared with the preceding year: ( 9 ) The returns received so far indicate a decrease in vaccination operations performed during the year. It is, however, gratifying to note that the percentage of successful primary operations has risen from 89.04 in 1923- 24 to 93.75 in 1924-25. Lymph issued during the year was of good quality and high potency. During the hot weather a breakdown occurred in the cold storage plant and engines. Consequently an expert Engineer had to be summoned by wire from Calcutta who was able to patch up the plant so as to carry on till the cold weather when the whole plant was dismantled and put in thorough working order. The total cost of replacing the defective parts and purchasing spares, tools, etc., amounted to Rs. 4,393. Fourteen thousand five hundred and eighty-three grammes of glyceri- nated lymph of the strength of 1 in 3 and 12 grammes of glycerine paste have been manufactured and placed in the cold storage for issue during 1925-26. The lighting plant worked satisfactorily during the year. Water-supply.( 10 ) months to undergo a course of instruction in the diseases of cattle.

Erratum slip to the Triennial Report on Vaccination in the United Provinces for 1923-24, 1924-25, and 1925-26. Page. For[Prescribed maximum lengthTRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE UNITED PROV- INCES OF AGRA AND OUDH FOR THE YEARS 1923-24, 1924. 25 AND 1925-26. Period covered by the report. 1. This report deals with vaccination during the triennium 1923- 24 to 1925-26, but more especially with the work done in 1925-26, brief notes on the work of the preceding two years having already been submitted. Area and popula- tion. 2. During the triennium under report the area of the province, ex- cluding the States of Rampur, Benares and Tehri- Garhwal, was 107,167 square miles and the popula- tion 45,375,787. Officers in charge of the department. 3. The charge of the department was held by me throughout the trien- nium, except for the period from April 23 to October 27, 1925, when I was on leave ex-India and Lieut.-Colonel W. A. Mearns, M.B., D.P.H., I.M.S., officiated for me. Constitution and strength of the de- partment. (Statement II.) 4. The charge of the several ranges was held by the following Assistant Directors of Public Health during the triennium under report:( 2 ) The number of Assistant Superintendents of Vaccination employed during the triennium remained the same, viz., 49, but that of vaccinators was 905 in 1923-24, 881 in 1924-25 and 888 in 1925-26. The district health scheme having been introduced in 16 districts, vide paragraph 81 of the Annual Sanitary Report for 1925, District Medical Officers of Health are District Superintendents of Vaccination in those districts instead of Civil Surgeons. Expenditure on vaccination: (Statement II) 5. Including the charges on account of the Assistant Directors of Public Health and their establishments, the ex- penditure of the Vaccination department amounted to Rs. 4,72,967 and excluding these charges to Rs. 4,07,476 in 1925-26, as compared with Rs. 4,61,492 and Rs. 3,98,376 in 1924-25 and Rs. 4,62,588 and Rs. 3,87,344 in 1923-24, respectively, the average annual expenditure in the two cases for the three years under report being Rs. 4,65,682 and Rs. 3,97,732, respectively, as against Rs. 4,25,900 and Rs. 3,64,073, respectively, for the preceding triennium. The increased expenditure in the triennium under review was due to the increased expenditure under the heads (1) Government Bovine Lymph Dépôt, Patwa Dangar, (2) vaccination establishment, (3) travelling allowance and (4) contingencies. Average cost of each successful case of vaccination. (Statement II.) 6. The average cost per successful operation amounted to annas four and pies five during the year under report as com- pared with annas four and pies nine in 1924-25 and annas four and pies ten in 1923-24. The average for the triennium under report was annas four and pies eight as compared with annas four and pies five in the preceding triennium. The following table shows the average cost of each successful case of vaccination in these provinces in the three years under report as compared with that of other provinces :( 3 ) General operations (Statement I.) 7. During 1925-26 the total number of persons vaccinated was 1,465,862 (1,281,453 primary and 184,409 re- vaccinations), against 1,296,756 and 1,267,442 in 1924-25 and 1923-24, respectively , The average for the triennium under report was 1,343,353 against 1,260,153 in the preceding triennium. The total number of operations performed during the year under report was 1,489,304 (1,304,127 primary and 185,177 re- vaccinations), against 1,318,693 and 1,310,148 in 1924-25 and 1923-24, respectively, and the average for the triennium under report was 1,372,715 against 1,271,793 for the previous triennium or an increase of 100,922. This is very satisfactory. The difference between the total number of vaccination operations performed and the total number of persons vaccinated represents secondary operations which numbered 23,442 in 1925-26 against 21,937 and 42,706 in 1924-25 and 1923-24, respectively, the annual average being 29,362 for the triennium under report against 11,640 for the preceding triennium. The percentages of successful primary vaccinations and re-vaccinations in which the results were known were 94.01 and 53.55, respectively, in 1925-26, against 95.21 and 61.55 in 1924-25 and 91.53 and 63.70 in 1923-24. The average for the triennium was 93.58 in the case of primary vaccinations and 59.60 in the case of re-vaccinations against 96.80 and 70.49, respectively, in the previous triennium. The average number of persons vaccinated by each vaccinator during the year under report was 1,650 against 1,472 in the preceding year and 1,400 in the year before last, the average for the triennium under report being 1,507 against 1,381 for the previous triennium. The table appended below shows the work done in the triennium under report as compared with the preceding triennium :( 4 ) An analysis of the above figures shows increases under all heads except under the heads of percentages of successful primary vaccinations and re- vaccinations. Successful primary vaccinations in differ- ent districts. (Statement I.) 8. The total number of successful primary vaccinations performed in the province was 1,208,273 in 1925-26 against 1,169,868 and 1,127,602 in 1924-25 and 1923-24, respectively, the average for the triennium being 1,168,581 against 1,144,462 in the preceding trien- nium or an increase of 24,119. Compared with the figures for the last year, the districts showing the largest increases are Ghazipur (6,513), Azamgarh (4,109) and Gonda (3,806). It is notable that in these districts District Medical Officers of Health have been in charge of vaccination instead of Civil Surgeons. The largest fall (1,647) occurred in Muttra. This was followed by Sul- tanpur with 1,374 and Meerut with 1,292. The decrease is accounted for by the District Superintendents of Vaccination concerned as follows :( 5 ) Mortality from small- pox. 11. In the year 1925 the number of deaths recorded from small-pox was higher than that in the preceding two years, the figures being, respectively, 9,373, 2,724 and 747. The ratios per mille for the three years were, respectively, .21, .06 and .02 and the quinquennial average .05. Diagram. 12. A diagram showing the relation between the mortality from small-pox and the proportion of the population pro- tected by vaccination in each district is attached. Dispensary vaccina- tion. (Statement III.) 13. The total number of operations performed by medical subordinates at hospitals during 1925-26 was 572 (304 primary and 268 re-vaccinations), against 287 in 1924-25 and 512 in 1923-24. The average for the triennium under report was 457 against 415 in the preceding triennium. Vaccination in mu- nicipalities. 14. In 1925-26 vaccination in municipalities showed a considerable increase in comparison with the figures of the pre- ceding two years, the total number of persons vaccin- ated and the number of operations performed being, respectively, 148,357 and 153,097 (111,015 primary and 42,082 re-vaccina- tions), against 115,177 and 118,071 in 1924-25 and 107,045 and 112,863 in 1923-24. The total number of successful primary vaccinations in munici- palities in the three years was, respectively, 96,445, 91,909 and 87,498 and that of successful re-vaccinations 15,718, 6,527 and 4,786. The ratio of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population during the three years was 38.60, 33.88 and 31.73, respectively. These results are very gratifying. The best protected municipalities were, in order, Almora (157.57), Mussoorie (145.17) and Naini Tal (103.69). Etah, which stood first last year with 72.42 persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population, occupies the fourth position on the list this year but with a higher degree of protection. Naini Tal, which was fourth last year is third this year. Among those showing a low degree of protection Mainpuri was worst with 24.39, followed by Kanauj with 24.59 and Ujhani with 24.94. All these, however, show an improvement over last year. Appendix B to this report shows the number of successful vaccinations performed on children under one year of age in different municipalities during the year under review. The total number in the triennium under report was 211,503 as compared with 204,078 in the preceding triennium. Vaccination in can- tonments. 15. The total number of persons vaccinated and the total number of operations performed in the cantonments of these prov- inces during the year 1925-26 were, respectively, 18,768 and 18,959 (6,213 primary and 12,746 re-vac- cinations), against 12,255 and 12,335 in 1924-25 and 10,988 and 11,162 in 1923-24, which is very satisfactory. The numbers of successful primary vac- cinations and re-vaccinations were, respectively, 5,246 and 7,377, against 4,995 and 4,117 in 1924-25 and 4,928 and 2,719 in 1923-24. The ratio of persons successfully vaccinated per mille of the population was 63.11, against 44.20 in 1924-25 and 38.23 in 1923-24. These figures show a very satisfactory improvement in 1925-26 over the preceding two years. During the triennium under review it was noticed that the vaccina- tion operations performed by military medical officers in cantonments were not incorporated in the district returns. The Deputy Director of Medical Services, Eastern Command, was accordingly asked to furnish the requisite information. He did not agree to the information being
( 6 ) furnished on the standard form of this department but issued instructions to the military officers concerned to send half-yearly returns to this office on the form prescribed by the Army department. These returns show that during the year 1925-26, 22,863 operations (502 primary and 22,361 re-vaccinations) were performed by the military medical officers against 20,786 in the year 1924-25 and 16,705 in 1923-24. The numbers of successful primary and re-vaccinations in the three years under review were 326 and 12,792, 236 and 10,644 and 336 and 5,679, respectively. As the returns received do not contain all the information required for the standard statements, the statistics contained therein cannot be included in any of the statements appended to this report. Vaccination in noti- fied areas- 16. During the year under report, 16,295 persons were vaccinated in the notified areas of the province and 16,641 vacci- nation operations (13,076 primary and 3,565 re- vaccinations) were performed against 14,024 and 14,263 in 1924-25 and 11,841 and 12,209 in 1923-24, respectively. The numbers of successful primary and successful re-vaccinations were, respectively, 11,813 and 1,283 against 11,585 and 774 in 1924-25 and 10,544 and 189 in 1923-24. The average number of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of the population was 37.53 against 35.78 in 1924-25 and 31.62 in 1923-24. The notified areas showing the highest protection were, in order, Bhim Tal (183.22), Chunar Settlement (106.41), Mainpuri civil station (66.91) and Bhinga (60.09). Among those showing the lowest degree of protection Rikhikesh (9.60), Karwi (13.43) and Bhowali (17.37) were the most conspicuous. Rikhikesh shows an improvement over last year. The decrease in Karwi is attributed to opposition on the part of public and in Bhowali to a few children either having left the place before vaccination or being unfit for vaccination owing to illness. Vaccination of school children. 17. It appeared from the inspection of school children carried out by the Special Health Officer, III Range, that nearly 33 per cent. of the children attending the muni- cipal schools in Allahabad were unprotected by vaccination. Accordingly, in September, 1925, the attention of all Assistant Directors of Public Health, District Superintendents of Vaccination and Municipal Medical Officers of Health was invited to the seriousness of the position and they were asked to inspect during the vaccination season, as far as possible, all school children in municipalities, notified areas, town areas and rural areas within their respective jurisdictions and to have those without good vacci- nation marks vaccinated and those over seven years of age re-vaccinated, where possible, under their personal supervision. In view of the facts disclosed by subsequent inspections, another circular was issued to all officers in the department asking them to make a careful examination of the state of vaccination in schools. In some municipalities where all the unprotected children could not be vaccinated at the schools arrangements were made to vaccinate them at their homes in accordance with the pro- visions of the Vaccination Act. This is not, however, possible in the rural areas where vaccination is not compulsory. The Director of Public Ins- truction, United Provinces, who was also addressed in the matter, issued necessary instructions to the educational authorities. The salient features noticed in the special reports submitted by the Assistant Directors of Public Health on the subject are mentioned below :( 7 ) 45.34 per cent. of the boys escaped vaccination altogether. The children with small-pox marks are, however, the survivals and estimating the mortality incidence to case incidence in such children as 35.35 per cent. the figure of 16.67 per cent. representing children with small-pox marks denotes that 25.45 per cent. had contracted the disease. The actual percentage of school-going class which escaped vaccination at birth was therefore 54.12 per cent. In the municipalities, out of 5,045 children seen in towns, 21.25 per cent. had no vaccination marks and 14.33 per cent. had small-pox marks ; so, allowing for deaths, 43.38 per cent. of the children of school-going class escaped vaccination at birth. II Range.( 8 ) introduction of compulsory vaccination in all rural areas, as has already been done in Bengal and to some extent in some other provinces. I cannot too strongly impress these views upon Government in the hope that they will extend vaccination by notification to the whole province at a very early date. The effect of this notification would be that all depart- ments of Government would then be required by law to assist the Vaccination department in carrying out their duties and, with this assistance, I do not anticipate that legal action would be necessary in an appreciable number of cases. Vaccination Act. 18. The Vaccination Act is in force in all municipalities, canton- ments and notified areas except in the notified areas of Rikhikesh (Dehra Dun) and Gunj Dund- wara (Etah). Steps are being taken to extend the Act to these areas. Compulsory vaccina- tion in rural areas. 19. The proposals for the extension of the United Provinces Vacci- nation Act to the rural areas were submitted to Government, but for the present Government have only agreed to extend the Act to the town areas and with this view have addressed Commissioners of divisions asking for their opinion as to the desirability of introducing compulsion in town areas. Attention is invited to my remarks in paragraph 17 above. General results of inspection. (Statement V.) 20. (a) By Assistant Directors of Public Health and District Superintendents of Vaccination.( 9 ) 21,554, Sultanpur with 19,665 and Basti with 18,336. The districts in which the smallest number of inspections was performed were Dehra Dun (6,108), Bara Banki (7,567), Rae Bareli (7,594), Meerut (7,607), and Fatehpur (7,834). The districts of Dehra Dun and Rae Bareli show an increase as compared with last year. The District Superintendents of Vaccination of all these districts will be asked to warn the Assistant Superintendents of Vaccination to devote more attention to this part of their duty. As regards the percentage of inspections of primary operations, Banda tops the list of the districts returning high percentages with 83.30, followed by Dehra Dun with 77.87, Etawah with 68.74, Sultanpur with 67.38 and Muttra with 66.98. Among the districts returning low percent- ages are Meerut with 14.87, Allahabad with 28.20, Hardoi with 29.00, Gonda with 30.06 and Agra with 32.65. The proportion of cases found successful to the total number inspected was 92.92 per cent. in the case of primary and 49.93 in the case of re-vaccinations as compared with 72.58 and 56.34 in 1924-25 and 90.33 and 48.14 in 1923-24, respectively. Provincial Bovine Lymph dépôt, Patwa Dangar, district Naini Tal. 21. The supervising charge of the dépôt was held by me throughout the triennium except the period from April 23, 1925, to October 27, 1925, during which I was on leave and the charge was held by Lieut.-Colonel W. A. Mearns, I.M.S. During 1925-26, the contract for the supply of calves was given to the old contractor at the rate of Rs. 12.8 per calf and Rs. 3 were paid by him for each animal returned, as against Rs. 12 and Rs. 3, respectively, in 1924-25 and Rs. 12 and Rs. 3-8, respectively, in 1923-24. The supply was not satisfactory owing to epidemics of infectious diseases which prevailed during the whole of the winter season in the districts of Bareilly, Moradabad and Pilibhit, and in Kumaun which resulted in the death of thousands of cattle. The majority of calves having arrived in an exhausted and emaciated condition, lymph obtained from them was poor. A greater number of calves had to be purchased to maintain a sufficient stock of lymph. All the calves that were purchased had to pass through the infected area and, therefore, carried infection with them. To avoid this, I am negotiating with the railway authorities for con- cession to rail calves from Bareilly and other stations on the Rohilkhand and Kumaun Railway to Kathgodam. The number of calves purchased or obtained on fees during 1925-26 including six dépôt calves was 610 (148 cow and 462 buffalo) as against 316 (21 cow and 295 buffalo) in 1924-25 and 342 (64 cow and 278 buffalo) in 1923-24. The disposal of 610 calves is given below :( 10 ) In addition to the above, one cross-bred Friesian bull, two cross-bred heifers and four cross-bred calves belonging to the dépôt live-stock died from rinderpest. During the year under review 20,961 grammes of crude lymph were obtained from 566 successfully vaccinated calves giving an average of 37.0 grammes per calf as against 12,801.4 grammes from 307 successful calves with an average of 41.7 grammes per calf in 1924-25 and 15,167.0 grammes from 328 successful calves with an average of 46.2 grammes per calf in 1923-24. In 1925-26 the average yield of crude lymph per cow-calf was 19.7 grammes and that per buffalo-calf 43.0, as com- pared with 11.1 and 43.9 grammes, respectively, in 1924-25 and 18.4 and 52.7, respectively, in 1923-24. As in last year the decrease in the average yield per calf was due to the calves supplied by the con- tractor being of inferier class. During the year under review, 106,028 grammes of glycerinated lymph (of strengths varying between 1 ( 11) During the year under review 93,056.2 grammes in metal collapsible tubes, 123,047 glass capillary tubes and 4 grammes of glycerine paste sufficient to vaccinate 2,449,553 persons were issued as compared with 86,332.5 grammes in metal collapsible tubes, 108,281 capillary tubes and 4 grammes of glycerine paste in 1924-25 and 86,993.75 grammes in metal collapsible tubes, 89,639 capillary tubes and 11 grammes of glycerine paste in 1923-24. Out of the total quantity of lymph issued, 409 capil- lary tubes and 325 grammes in bulk worth Rs. 199 were issued free to jails and missions in 1925-26 as against 233 capillary tubes and 75 gram- mes in bulk worth Rs. 59 in 1924-25 and 12 capillary tubes and 125.75 grammes in bulk worth Rs. 72 in 1923-24. During the triennium under review, the system of payment for lymph supplied to local bodies from the Government Bovine Lymph dépôt at contract rates was sanctioned by Government and was given effect to from April 1,1925. During 1925-26, 85 municipalities and 41 notified areas were supplied with lymph on payment. The notified areas of Main- puri Civil Station, Aonla, Auraiya, Sheopur, Moghal Sarai, Chunar Settlement, Badshahpur, Madhoganj and Pauri did not purchase lymph from the dépôt in 1925 26. In 1925-26, lymph worth Rs. 20,523 was sold to district boards, Rs. 5,901 to municipalities, Rs. 3,757 to Indian States, Rs. 1,446 to private persons and by value payable posts, Rs. 958 to notified areas and Rs. 755 to cantonments, as against Rs. 18,932, Rs. 6,985, Rs. 3,872, Rs. 1,430, Rs. 1,069 and Rs. 703, respectively, in the preceding year and Rs. 19,274, Rs. 6,244, Rs. 3,536, Rs. 1,631, Rs. 959 and Rs. 572, respectively, in the year before. During the triennium under review due to decrease in the supply of lymph, the annual contract grant paid by the Military department for lymph supplied to them was reduced from Rs. 3,000 to Rs. 1,300. Lymph worth Rs. 1,577 was supplied to the Military department during 1925-26, worth Rs. 1,215 in 1924-25 and worth Rs. 1,052 in 1923-24, on an annual contract grant of Rs. 1,300. The Military department had agreed to pay for the actual quantity of lymph supplied from April 1, 1925, but it was subsequently decided that the contract system should continue up to the end of 1926-27. The total receipts of the dépôt in 1925-26, excluding arrears for the previous years, amounted to Rs. 38,357 (Rs. 34,640 from the sale of lymph and Rs. 3,717 from the sale of miscellaneous articles) as compared with Rs. 37,251 in 1924-25 and Rs. 37,967 in 1923-24. The sale-proceeds of lymph could not be realized in full within the financial year. This appears to be due to the non-provision of necessary funds by some local bodies in their budgets. The total amount of arrears still due to the dépôt on account of lymph supplied in 1925-26 and three preceding years is Rs. 17,606. This amount includes Rs. 4,300 due from the Military department. Necessary steps are being taken to realize outstandings from the defaulters. The total expenditure of the dépôt in 1925-26 was Rs. 47,592 as against Rs. 41,647 in 1924-25 and Rs. 36,014 in 1923-24. A comparison of the figures of income and expenditure shows that the dépôt worked at a loss which amounted to Rs. 9,235 during the year under review, but this loss is more apparent than real and was altogether due to two unforeseen causes (a) the disastrous epidemic of rinderpest and
( 12 ) (b) the break down of the engines. It is mainly accounted for by a non- recurring expenditure of( 13 ) There was a break down again this year in the cold storage plant owing to the cylinder head being cracked which caused a great loss of ammonia and power. Prompt steps were taken to patch up the plant to carry on till the cold weather when the refrigerating plant was dismantled and a new cylinder head and spares were obtained from Calcutta. The plant is now working satisfactorily. Twenty-two thousand seven hundred and forty-one grammes of glycer- inated lymph of a strength of 1( 14 ) With a view to farther improve the state of vaccination in municipal- ities, I proposed to Government that in the districts where a district medical officer of health had been appointed, the control of vaccination in the municipalities (which are without a separate medical officer of health) of the district, should be transferred to the district medical officer of health. The Government, while agreeing to the proposal, directed that arrange- ments in this respect should be made in consultation with district and municipal boards concerned. At present outbreaks of small-pox are not reported and consequently information regarding the prevalence of the disease in a district reaches the District Superintendents of Vaccination in the form of the usual monthly mortuary returns about two months after the occurrence, and, consequently, much time is lost before proper measures for arresting its spread can be taken. I have, therefore, suggested to Government that primary outbreaks should be reported immediately, like those of plague and cholera, and when this is sanctioned, it would be possible to take prompt measures to combat the disease.

Brief notes on vacci- nation in 1926-27. A detailed report for the triennium 1923-24, 1924-25 and 1925-26 having been submitted last year, this report deals briefly with vaccination in 1926-27 as compared with 1925-26. Area and population. 2. Excluding the States of Rampur, Benares and Tehri-Garhwal, the area of the province according to census of 1921 was 107,167 square miles and the population 45,375,787. Officer in charge of the department. 3. I held charge of the office of the Superintendent-General of Vacci- nation, throughout the year. Constitution and strength of the depart- ment. (Statement II.) 4. The following officers were in charge of the several ranges during the year under report. I RANGE. Dr. K. L. Chaudhri, D.P.H., throughout the year. II RANGE. Lieut.-Colonel W. A. Mearns, I.M.S., from April 1, 1926 to March 9, 1927, on which date he proceeded on leave. Captain D. Clyde, I.M.S., from March 10, 1927, to the close of the year. III RANGE. Dr. A. Sousa, D.P.H., throughout the year. IV RANGE. Dr. K. P. Mathur, D.P.H., throughout the year. The number of Assistant Superintendents of Vaccination (49) remained unaltered while that of vaccinators was 898 against 888 in the preceding year. In addition to the 16 districts mentioned in the last year's report, the district health scheme was extended to the district of Bulandshahr during the year under report and the District Medical Officer of Health is now the District Superintendent of Vaccination in that district instead of the Civil Surgeon. Expenditure on vacci- nation. (Statement II.) 5. In 1926-27 there was an increase of Rs. 8,249 in the total expendi- ture excluding the charges on account of the Assis- tant Directors of Public Health and their establish- ment and that of Rs. 16,426 including these charges, as compared with 1925-26, the total during the two years being Rs. 4,15,725 and Rs. 4,07,476 and Rs. 4,89,393 and Rs. 4,72,967, respect- ively. The increase was due to the increased expenditure under the heads (1) Government Bovine Lymph dépôt, (2) vaccination establishment, (3) travelling allowance and (4) contingencies.
( 2 ) Average cost of each successful case of vac- cination. (Statement II.) 6. The average cost of each successful case of vaccination in these provinces during the year was nearly the same as in the preceding year, the figures for the two years being annas four and pies six and annas four and pies five, respectively. The following table shows the average cost of each successful case of vaccination in these provinces during the year underreport as compared with that of other provinces : ( 3 ) of experienced vaccinators to the Kumbh fairs at Brindaban and Hardwar and the appointment of new men in their places. Successful primary vaccinations in differ- ent districts. (Statement I.) 8. In 31 out of 48 districts the number of successful primary vaccina- tions performed in 1926-27 was in excess of that performed during the preceding year. Of these Fyzabad headed the list with an increase of 4,989, followed by Lucknow with 2,847, Ballia with 2,541, Partabgarh with 2,391 and Allahabad with 1,921. It is notable that in all these districts except Lucknow, District Medical Officers of Health were incharge of vaccination instead of Civil Surgeons. Of the 17 districts showing a falling off, the most conspicuous were Meerut with a decrease of 3,311, Kheri with 3,082, Budaun with 3,035, Muzaffarnagar with 2,785 and Almora with 2,020. The causes of decrease in these districts were :( 4 ) preceding year. The figures for the second, third and fourth ranges were 43.70 against 42.86 ; 61.47 against 60.95 and 40.36 against 43.86, res- pectively. The first range showed the best protection in comparison to other ranges. Mortality from small- pox. 11. The total number of deaths registered from small-pox in 1926 amounted to 12,020 indicating a death-rate of .26 against 9,373 and .21, respectively, in 1925. The quinquennial average was .07. Diagram. 12. The diagram appended shows the relation between the mortality from small-pox and the protection afforded by vaccination in each district. Dispensary vaccina- tion. (Statement III.) 13. The total number of vaccination operations performed by medical subordinates at dispensaries during the year 1926-27 was 1,373 (552 primary and 821 re-vaccinations) against 572 (304 primary and 268 re-vaccinations) in 1925-26, or more than double. Vaccination in mu- nicipalities. 14. During the year 1926-27, the total number of persons vaccinated in municipalities in the United Provinces was 141,801 against 148,357 in 1925-26. The total number of operations performed during the year was 145,100 (110,006 primary and 35,094 re-vaccinations) against 153,097 in the preced- ing year. The ratio of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of the popu- lation was 38.14 against 38.60. The figures show a decline compared to those for 1925-26, which (as in the case of districts) is due to the deputation of a number of municipal vaccinators to the Kumbh fairs at Hardwar and Brindaban. The best protected municipalities during the year were, in order, Naini Tal (173.33), Almora (125.23) and Etah (98.99). Among the municipa- lities showing the least degree of protection, Dehra Dun was first with 20.03, followed by Baraut (Meerut district) with 20.96 and Brindaban with 22.48. Appendix B shows the number of successful vaccinations performed on children under one year of age in the different municipalities during the year under review. The total number of such operations performed during 1926-27 was 74,981 against 70,705 in 1925-26 or an increase of 4,276. Vaccination in can- tonments. 15. 17,376 persons were vaccinated and 17,404 operations (6,036 primary and 11,368 re-vaccinations) were performed in 1926-27 against 18,763 and 18,959, respectively, in the preceding year. The numbers of successful primary vaccinations and re-vaccinations in the two years were 5,452 and 6,599 and 5,246 and 7,377, respectively. The number of persons success- fully vaccinated per 1,000 of the population amounted to 60.25 in 1926-27 as compared with 63.11 in 1925-26. The Director of Medical Services, Eastern Command, United Provinces, having expressed his inability to furnish vaccination returns for the official year for the purposes of vaccination report, he was asked to furnish the information for the calendar year. The returns received from the military medical officers show that 15,618 operations (485 primary and 15,133 re-vaccinations) were performed by these officers during the year under report. Of the 15,618 operations, 10,774 (426 primary and 10,348 re-vaccinations) were successful,
( 5 ) Vaccination in no- tified areas. 16. During the year under review, the number of persons vaccinated in notified areas amounted to 13,583 and that of operations performed to 213,806 (12,186 primary and 1,620 re-vaccinations, as compared with 16,295 and 16,641 (13,076 primary and 3,565 re-vaccinations) in 1925-26. The total number of successful vaccinations was 11,234 primary and 788 re- vaccinations as against 11,813 and 1,283, respectively, in the preceding year. The number of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of the population amounted to 34.45 against 37.53 in 1925-26. Among the well-protected notified areas, Colonelganj stood first with a ratio of 54.31, followed by Bhinga with 52.66, Nanpara with 48.88 and Utraula with 47.87. Of the notified areas showing the least protection the worst were Bhim Tal (10.24), Rikhikesh (12.51), Bargain Bazar (17.04) and Ramnagar (19.01). In Bhim Tal and Ramnagar the decrease is ascribed partly to few children having been left unvaccinated on account of ill-health and partly to the non-occurrence of small-pox, while in Bargain Bazar it was due to a large number of vaccinations (both primary and re-vaccinations) having been performed in the railway compound and workshops on account of the prevalence of small-pox in the town during the vaccination season of 1925-26. Rikhikesh shows an improve- ment over last year. Vaccination of school children. 17. As in the preceding year, a vigorous campaign of inspection of school children for vaccination in rural areas was carried on by the public health staff during the year under review. According to the returns avail- able up to date as many as 2,845 schools were visited by the district health staff in this connection. The total number of children found un- protected in these schools was 21,726. Of these, 17,J85 children were vaccinated on the spot. In addition to this the assistant directors of public health on general duty inspected a number of schools for the purpose. As a large number of boys who attend schools in rural arreas are not protected against small-pox, Government circularised all chairmen, district boards, and asked them to make an effort to get such boys vaccinated by enlisting the support of parents and guardians. Vaccination Act. 18. The Vaccination Act is in force in all municipalities, cantonments and notified areas, except in the notified area of Gunj Dundwara (Etah). Compulsory vaccina- tion in rural areas. 19. During the year under report Government addressed divisional commissioners and asked them to express their views after consulting district magistrates and the district boards in their divisions as to whether legislation should be undertaken for making vaccination compulsory throughout the province. The matter is still under their consideration. The necessity of extending the Vaccination Act to the rural area is urgent, and almost all the district medical officers of health have recommended its extension, vide paragraph 80 of the Sanitary Report for 1926. General results of inspection. (Statement V). 20. (a) By Assistant Directors of Public Health and District Super- intendents of Vaccination.( 6 ) 15,256 as compared with the preceding year, the actual number of cases inspected during the two years being, respectively, 179,223 (174,337 pri- mary and 4,886 re-vaccinations) and 194,479 (191,060 primary and 3,419 re-vaccinations). The percentage of inspections to total number vaccinated was 13.54 in the case of primary and 3.39 in that of re-vaccinations as against 14.91 and 1.86 in 1925-26, respectively. Among the districts showing a large number of inspections, Gorakhpur and Jaunpur which stood second and third last year, beat Azamgarh and secured the first and second positions with 18,054 and 12,076 vaccination inspections, Azamgarh getting the third position with 11,947. Then came in order Sultanpur, Partabgarh and Fyzabad with 11,238, 10,677 and 10,413 inspections, respectively. The districts returning the smallest number of inspections were Aligarh (165), Jhansi (282), Mainpuri (293), Almora (382) and Garhwal (436). All these except Almora showed a decline as compared to the work done in the previous year. (b) By Assistant Superintendents of Vaccination and other in- specting officers.( 7 ) should be adopted to ascertain the occurrence of the disease. All the district superintendents of vaccination and medical officers of health of municipalities were accordingly asked to report on the matter after the vaccination season. From the replies received it appears that only one case of post-vaccinal encephalitis was found in the Lucknow muni- cipality. Provincial Bovine Lymph depot, Patwa Dangar (District Naini Tal). 22. I held the supervising charge of the dépôt throughout the year under report. The new system of railing calves from Bareilly, as suggested last year, in order to avoid the calves being brought through the areas infected with contagious diseases, was introduced. The contract for the supply of calves was at first given to the old con- tractor Abdul Rahim, in the beginning of the season at the rate of Rs. 10-8-0 per calf and Rs. 3 were paid by him for each animal returned, but as he failed to supply the required number of calves, which caused great inconvenience and loss to Government, his contract was cancelled and the security deposit of Rs. 200 forfeited for breach of contract according to the terms of his agreement. The contract was then given to another man, at the same rate. He carried out his contract in a satisfactory manner, as far as numbers were concerned, but owing to an epidemic of rinderpest in the whole of the Bareilly and Tarai and Bhabar districts, the calves were in very poor condition with the result that the outturn of lymph was bad. The total number of calves purchased from the contractors or obtained from other sources was 499 (104 cow and 395 buffalo calves) against 610 (148 cow and 462 buffalo calves) in the preceding year( 8 ) Appended is a table showing the annual output of lymph, and the income and expenditure of the dépôt:( 9 ) the Military department was Rs. 1,217 against the annual contract of Rs. 1,300. During the year under report lymph worth Rs. 20,751 was sold to district boards, Rs. 5,903 to municipalities, Rs. 2,506 to the Indian States, Rs. 2,331 to private persons and by value payable posts, Rs. 915 to noti- fied areas and Rs. 624 to cantonments as compared with Rs. 20,523, Rs. 5,901, Rs. 3,757, Rs. 1,446, Rs. 958 and Rs. 755, respectively, in the preceding year. The total income of the dépôt during the year under report was Rs. 37,603 (Rs. 34,330 by sale of lymph, Rs. 3,273 on account of sale proceeds of miscellaneous articles) as against Rs. 38,357 in 1925-26( 10 ) During the years 1910-11 to 1923-24 (except in 1920-21) the income of the dépôt always exceeded the expenditure, more especially so before a largely increased expenditure was entailed owing to the installation of the cold storage plant, but under present conditions, it is in my opinion impos- sible to increase the receipts or to lower the expenditure unless the price of the lymph issued to district boards, municipalities and notified areas, is considerably increased. The price of the lymph issued in bulk to local bodies is the same now as it was before the heavy rise of prices which occurred during and after the war and this fact accounts for the recent deficits. Prices of calves, fodder, coolies and other establishment and the prices of annual repairs, buildings and machinery have largely increased while the price of the lymph has remained stationary. In addition Rs. 1,562 pension charges are now included in the dépôt budget while before this was not included. Also Rs. 3,580 per annum for annual repairs is now included while before this was in the Public Works department budget. The profits previously shown did not take these two items into account at all. The policy of Government in the past has been to endeavour to make the receipts and sale of lymph equal to the expenditure on the dépôt, but as I have said above this is not possible unless the price of lymph to the local bodies is raised by between 30 and 40 per cent. I am personally of the opinion that it would be very bad policy indeed to raise the price of the lymph to local bodies as it is evident from my accounts and from my knowledge of the budgets of district and municipal boards that they have even now the greatest difficulty in paying for the lymph supplied even at present prices. In the year under report out of about Rs. 28,000 due from local bodies only about Rs. 14,000 have been paid and some local bodies are often one or two years and even more in arrears. The Government is aware that the majority of local bodies agreed to a contract rate for lymph supplied instead of the old system of payment for the actual amount issued. Local bodies, therefore, know exactly the amount they have to pay at the very beginning of the financial year, but in spite of this, the majority fail to make these payments. The contract system was introduced solely for the purpose of facilitating payments within the financial year concerned and it appears to have failed in its object. The Government is also aware that during the last two or three years small-pox has been far more prevalent than in the previous decade. As a result of this the amount of lymph issued at contract rates has been considerably more than the amount issued on payment; the dépôt, there- fore, lost income by the introduction of these contract rates. As, however, the financial condition of most local bodies is in a pre- carious state, it is probable that under the old system much less lymph would have been used and much more small-pox would have occurred. After fully considering the whole question, I have come to the conclu- sion that the time has now come for Government to stop the issue of lymph to local bodies on payment and to issue it free of all charges. I am convinced that if this were done, more lymph would be used and more vaccination would be carried out. It would also relieve local bodies of these annual payments and release these funds for other purposes, such as increased grants for the improvement of sanitation. At present the
( 11 ) grants made for sanitary purposes by most district boards are practically negligible. Taking the figures of the current year, if Government were to decide the issue of lymph free to local bodies in the future, the loss of income would be Rs. 27,568-6-6 which would reduce the income of the dépôt from an average of Rs. 37,500 to Rs. 10,000 annually. This Rs. 10,000 is mostly made up of sale of lymph to Indian States, the military and cantonment authori- ties and private persons and the sale of miscellaneous articles, such as milk, eggs, garden produce, calves, etc. I hope that Government will give this proposal their most favourable consideration in the interests of vaccination in general. The total number of vaccination operations performed with calf lymph in 1926-27 amounted, 1,449,108 (1,304,368 primary and 144,740 re-vaccinations) as compared with 1,489,307 in 1925-26.

( 12 ) 30,677 grammes of glycerinated lymph of the strength of 1( 13 ) Chapter XCVII of the Manual of Government Orders relating to vaccination was revised during the year under report and the revised draft submitted to Government for approval.

ForNOTES ON VACCINATION IN THE UNITED PROVINCES FOR THE YEAR 1927-28. Area and popula- tion. According to census of 1921 the area of the province, excluding the States of Rampur, Benares and Tehri- Garhwal, was 107,167 square miles and the population 45,375,787. Charge of the depart-ment. 2. I held charge of the office of the Superintendent-General of Vaccination throughout the year. Constitution and strength of the depart- ment (Statement II). 3. As stated in paragraph 75 of the annual sanitary report for 1927, the III and IV Ranges were combined into one range with headquarters at Allahabad with effect from October 1, 1927, from which date the post of the Assistant Director of Public Health (Hygiene Publicity Bureau) was created. The following officers were in charge of the several ranges during the year under report: ( 2 ) Expenditure on vac- cination (Statement II). 4. There was a decrease of Rs. 18,388 in the total expenditure in 1927-28, including the charges on account of the assistant directors of public health and their establishment and of Rs. 8,775 excluding these charges as compared with 1926-27, the total amounts spent during the two years being Rs. 4,71,005 and Rs. 4,89,393 and Rs. 4,06,950 and Rs. 4,15,725, respectively. The dec- rease is attributable to (1) the abolition of the IV Range, (2) the dec- reased expenditure under the Government Bovine Lymph Dépôt, Patwa Dangar, and (3) the fact that the Assistant Director of Public Health, II Range, was on leave ex-India for eight months. Average cost of each successful case of vac- cination (Statement II). 5. The average cost of each successful case of vaccination in these provinces during the year under report was practically the same as in the preceding year. The figures for the two years were annas four and pies four and annas four and pies six, res- pectively. The following table shows the average cost of each suc- cessful case of vaccination in these provinces during the year under report as compared with other provinces :( 3 ) During the year each vaccinator vaccinated on an average 1,597.93 persons as against 1,615.89 in the preceding year. The ratio of per- sons successfully vaccinated by the district staff was 29.45 per mille of the population as compared with 28.44 in 1926-27. Successful primary vaccinations in differ- ent districts (State- ment I). 7. Like last year, in 31 out of 48 districts the number of success- ful primary vaccinations performed in 1927-28 was in excess of that performed in the preceding year. Of these Gorakhpur stood first with an increase of 30,435 and was followed by Benares (3,744), Kheri (3,229), Rae Bareli (2,751), Azamgarh (2,475) and Muttra (2,442). In all these districts the district medical officers of health were in charge of vaccination instead of civil surgeons. Of the 17 districts showing a decrease, the most conspicuous were Bijnor (1,844), Shahjahanpur (1,046), Garhwal (790), Fyzabad (665) and Pilibhit (611). The causes of decrease in these districts are reported to be :( 4 ) Mortality from small- pox. 10. The number of deaths from small-pox registered during 1927 was 7,894 against 12,020 of the previous year. The death rates for the two years were .17 and .26, respectively, and the average for the past five years .11. Diagram. 11. A diagram showing the relation between the mortality from small-pox and the protection afforded by vaccina- tion in each district is attached. Dispensary vaccina- tion (Statement III). 12. The total number of vaccination operations performed by medical subordinates at dispensaries during 1927- 28 was 341 (193 primary and 148 re-vaccinations) against 1,373 (552 primary and 821 re-vaccina- tions) in 1926-27. Vaccination in muni- cipalities. 13. The vaccination work performed in municipalities during the year under review shows a decrease as compared with that of the preceding year, the total number of persons vaccinated during the two years being 125,722 and 141,801, respectively. The total number of vaccination operations performed in municipal towns in 1927-28 was 133,265 (110,975 primary and 22,290 re-vaccinations) and that in 1926-27 145,100 (110,006 primary and 35,094 re-vaccinations). The ratio of persons successfully vaccinated per mille of the population was 36.78 against 38.14 in the preceding year. This decline in work is due to the spread of plague during the vaccination season. It is also due to the fact that in 1926-27, owing to the prevalence of small-pox, a larger number of vaccination operations was performed. Among the well protected municipalities Mussoorie occupied the first position with a ratio of 174.86 per mille and was followed by Sitapur, Etah, Sultanpur and Gonda with ratios of 92.99, 72.10, 68.39 and 61.31, respectively. Among those showing the least protection, Kashipur, Naini Tal, Brindaban, Farrukhabad and Kanauj were the worst showing ratios of 21.56, 22.97, 25.15, 25.24 and 25.36, respectively. In Kashipur the decrease was due to the fact that most of the people left Kashipur on account of plague, while in Naini Tal owing to an out- break of small-pox in 1926-27 more persons were vaccinated than in 1927-28. Brindaban, Farrukhabad and Kanauj show an improvement over last year. The number of successful vaccinations performed on children under the age of one year in the municipalities, during the year under report, was 77,862 (vide Appendix B) as against 74,981 in 1926-27, indicating an increase of 2,881. Vaccination in can- tonments. 14. During the year under report 11,783 persons were vaccinated and 12,195 operations (6,446 primary and 5,749 re-vaccinations) were performed by the vaccination staff in cantonments against 17,376 and 17,404, respectively, in the preceding year. The numbers of successful primary vaccinations and successful re-vaccinations for the two years were 5,645 and 3,206 and 5,452 and 6,599, respectively. The number of persons
( 5 ) successfully vaccinated per mille of the population was 44.25 in 1927-28 and 60.25 in 1926-27. During the calendar year 1927, the military medical officers in cantonments performed 1,171 primary vaccinations and 11,891 re- vaccinations, of which 1,055 and 8,469, respectively, were successful. Vaccination in noti- fied areas. 15. The number of persons vaccinated in notified areas during the year under report was 14,752 as compared with 13,583 in 1926-27. Vaccination operations num- bered 15,282 against 13,806. The total number of successful primary vaccinations amounted to 12,772 and that of successful re-vaccinations to 389 as against 11,234 and 788, respectively, in the preceding year. The number of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of the population was 35.20 in 1927-28 and 34.45 in 1926-27. Among the well protected areas, Chunar settlement stood first with a ratio of 91.84, followed by Gorakhpur, Bhimtal, Bhinga and Rath with the respective ratios of 83.21, 58.63, 57.34 and 48.76. Among those showing the least protection were Rikhikesh, Bhowali, Ramnagar, Bilgram and Auraiya, each giving a ratio of 10.18, 19.19, 20.00, 21.84 and 21.79, respectively. Ramnagar, Auraiya and Bilgram show an improvement over last year. In Rikhikesh the decrease is ascribed to the fact that less lymph was indented for on account of the Kumbh fair. This explanation is unsatisfactory and the president, notified area committee, is being addressed on the subject. In Bhowali the decrease is negligible. Vaccination ofschool children. 16. The public health staff visited as many as 3,054 schools for the inspection of the vaccination state of school chil- dren. They found a large number of scholars un- vaccinated. Many of these were got vaccinated by the officers in their presence. The total number of vaccinations carried out in schools as reported by the district medical officers of health and civil surgeons was 28,187. The assistant directors of public health also conducted similar inspections in the course of their tours. Although vaccination is compulsory in municipal areas, a fairly large percentage of the scholars escape vaccination. The attempts of the medical officers of health to vaccinate these are hampered in certain cases by the school masters themselves. A particular instance was brought to the notice of the Director of Public Instruction, United Provinces, who kindly issued instructions to the educational authori- ties for extending the necessary facilities to medical officers of health. Application of the Vaccination Act. 17. Up to the end of March, 1928 the Vaccination Act was in force in all municipalities, cantonments and noti- fied areas, except in the notified areas of Jalaun, Bindki (Fatehpur district) and Hasanpur (Mora- dabad district), which were newly created during the year. The question of the extension of the provisions of the Act to these areas is under the consideration of the local authorities concerned. The pro- visions of the Act were extended to the notified areas of Rikhikesh in the Dehra Dun district and Ganjdundwara in the Etah district and to the Basti town area, during the year under report.
( 6 ) Compulsory vaccina- tion in rural areas. 18. The necessity of making vaccination compulsory in rural areas is increasingly felt every year and nearly all the district medical officers of health have commented on the opposition to vaccination in rural areas offered by the high caste people. In spite of persuasion and propa- ganda carried on in the villages, the number of children which escape vaccination is very considerable, being in some districts as much as 33 per cent. of the children available. The danger of an epidemic of small-pox under such conditions can be well understood. In more than one case vaccinators were roughly handled by the villagers in their attempts to vaccinate the recalcitrants. Vaccination on a voluntary basis has now been in existence for a very long time and the ground has been well prepared for the intro- duction of compulsion. It is gratifying to note that the Government are considering the making of the Vaccination Act compulsory in rural areas. A number of children escapes vaccination in municipal towns owing to defect in section 9 of the Vaccination Act which lays down that girls up to 8 years of age and boys up to 14 years of age only should be vaccinated. I hope Government will accept my recommen- dation to remove this defect by making necessary amendments when the present Act is amended. General results of inspection (Statement V). 19. (a) By assistant directors of public health and district superintendents of vaccination.( 7 ) Gorakhpur stood first with a total of 38,227 inspections. Then came, in order, Almora (26,814), Basti (19,353), Garhwal (19,273) and Bareilly (17,873). Among the districts showing the smallest number of inspections the most conspicuous were Aligarh (5,564), Dehra Dun (6,076), Naini Tal (6,774), Jalaun (7,232) and Bara Banki (7,609). Comparing the figures for the preceding year the districts of Gorakh- pur, Basti, Garhwal, Dehra Dun, Jalaun and Bara Banki show increases, while Almora, Bareilly, Aligarh and Naini Tal show decreases. The district superintendents of vaccination will be addressed in the matter. As stated above the provincial average of inspections of primary vaccinations to total number vaccinated by these agencies during the year was 41.88 against 43.36 in the preceding year. The districts showing the largest percentages of inspections of primary vaccinations were Banda (77.84), Garhwal (71.08), Almora (69.63) and Etawah (67.05). The lowest percentages of inspections were recorded in Aligarh (15.81), Meerut (21.24), Moradabad (25.84), Sultanpur (26.06). (c) Verification of the percentage of successful vaccinations.( 8 ) on fee. Of the 318 calves used only one failed, while 20 died after operation. The deaths amongst the calves were low because of the precautionary measures taken to check the spread of the disease and the better class of the animals supplied by the contractor. Out of the 298 calves which survived after vaccination, 248 calves were sold and 50 were returned to their owner. The total quantity of crude lymph obtained from the 317 calves successfully vaccinated was 16,371½ grammes giving an average yield of 51.45 grammes per calf. In the preceding year 19,024 grammes of crude lymph were obtained from 452 calves with an average yield of 42.09 grammes. The increase in the yield in the year under report was therefore 9.36 grammes per calf. The average yield of crude lymph per cow calf and buffalo calf, separately, was 19.50 grammes and 62.40 grammes, respectively, against 21.96 grammes and 47.98 grammes, respectively, in the preceding year. 47,587 ½ grammes of glycerinated lymph of the strength of 1( 9 ) (primary 1,381,781 and re-vaccination 110,320) as compared with 1,449,108 (1,304,368 primary and 144,740 re-vaccinations) in the preced- ing year. The following table shows the result of vaccinations performed during the year under report, as compared with the preceding year :( 10 ) dépôt during the year under report was Rs. 42,514, i.e., Rs. 38,085 from the sale of lymph and Rs. 4,429 from the sale-proceeds of mis- cellaneous articles such as milk, fowls, eggs and garden produce, etc. In the preceding year the total income was Rs. 37,603, i.e., Rs. 34,330 from the sale of lymph and Rs. 3,273 from the sale of miscellaneous articles. The total expenditure on the dépôt during the year under report was Rs. 43,340 against Rs. 45,916 in the preceding year. It will, therefore, be seen that there was an increase in income by Rs. 4,911 and decrease in expenditure by Rs. 2,576. The actual loss on the working of the dépôt was only Rs. 826. It must be remembered that the figures of income do not include the value of the lymph manufactured during the year and kept in stock for issue next year, as it cannot be said how much of the lymph so set aside will retain sufficient potency for use in the coming season. The figures of income, on the other hand, include payments made for the lymph manufactured in the preceding year and issued during the year under report. The factor relating to the value of the lymph in stock is therefore fairly constant. Appended is a table showing the annual output of lymph, and the income and expenditure of the dépôt since its establishment : ( 11 ) (h) Plant and machinery.( 12 ) of the activities of the health staff one Ram Adhar Singh visited a certain village in the interior of the Sultanpur district and pretending to be an official subordinate to the civil surgeon realized money from villagers. The sanitary inspector of the tahsil during the course of his tour received the information of the presence of the man and managed to make him over to the police. The man was convicted and sentenced to six months' rigorous imprisonment. NAINI TAL : The 11th June, 1928. C. L.
