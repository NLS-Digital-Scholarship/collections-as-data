Annual Administration Report for the official year 1892-93. No. 1274 of 1893. FROM THE SUPERINTENDENT, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency; To THE SECRETARY to GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. Camp Ahmednagar, dated 8th July 1893. SIR, I have the honour to submit for the consideration of His Excellency the Governor in Council this my First Annual Administration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, late Horse-Breeding, in the Bombay Presidency and Beluchistan, for the official year 1892-93. 2. I beg to state that the delay is owing to several of the reports from district officers being sent in late and my report having been called for, I have been compelled to compile it without returns for three stallions in Khelat. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, J. W. A. MORGAN, Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency. B 360-1
GOVERNMENT OF BOMBAY. CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT. ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT FOR THE OFFICIAL YEAR 1892-93. Horse-Breeding. Stallions: number of. At the close of the last year the number of stal- lions was as follows:4 Number of stallions present. 6. The increase and decrease noted above left the strength of horse stal- lions on the 1st April 1893 as shown in the following table:5 11. Supa has been temporarily abolished until the stables are repaired. It will be seen that three horse stands, one pony and four donkey stands have been abolished, whilst 5 horse and 5 donkey stands have been established. Stallions: demand for. 12. The demand for stallions is increasing and I have indented for three thorough-bred and three three-quarter-bred horses from England and I shall require to purchase about 12 Arabs locally. I purchased one Turkoman stallion "Kashgi" for the Hyder- abad Local Board. 13. Appendix VI gives the cost of feed, keep, attendants, transit, &c., during 1892-93 of horse and pony stallions, and the figures given below show the general average cost per annum during the preceding ten years:6 16. The table given beneath shows the numbers removed from the re- gisters for various reasons:7 Produce, &c. 20. The results from the coverings of 1891-92 are given in Appendix VIII. 21. The average number of produce foaled per stallion employed for the last two years is given below:8 prejudicial effect on this market. I have consulted experienced Cavalry officers in Sind and they are of opinion that more than sufficient for their wants are brought to these shows. My own opinion and that of the Remount Officer is that the horses obtainable here are superior to those brought in the Bombay market. The First Bengal Cavalry stationed at Saugor, Central Provinces, bought 20 at the last Quetta fair and. 30 at Sibi. Some of these were the produce of Government sires. The North-Western Railway were asked during the last Sibi Show to carry Government horses at reduced rates and they immediately complied. The British India Steam Navigation Company have also promised to convey horses from Karáchi to Bombay at a considerable re- duction. I would again urge the necessity of thoroughly opening out this market to the Bombay Presidency, as there appears to be hardly any limit to the number obtainable, provided due notice is given to the dealers. If it is de- cided to give the experiment a trial, timely warning should be sent as to the number and class of horse required so as to enable dealers to collect and bring them in. It is very essential that this should be done, as the majority were so disappointed at the bad sales last year that it is highly improbable that they will undertake the risk again without being told that if suitable horses are brought, purchasers will be forthcoming. Few mature horses, the produce of Government sires, are obtainable at the shows held in the Presidency, as the best are procured when under three years of age for the Government rearing depôts and the remainder are eagerly bought up by native dealers and taken to different parts of India where a ready market is found for them. Such being the case, I would again point out how desirable it is that the four Bombay Cavalry Regiments should have another market besides Bombay, where suitable horses can be obtained. Taking all expenses into consideration, I think the average would compare very favourably with Bombay, and there can be no doubt that these horses are far and away superior to the cheap common under-bred waler obtainable at Cavalry prices. Mules purched for transport. 29. This is a new return and shows during the year 151 mules were bought up by the Commissariat Department for trans- port purposes9 Increase during the year. 32. The number received during the year is given below:10 Mule stock: number of. 38. A general statement will be found in Appendix XV giving the results for 1892-93. A summary of this is here shown:11 ful as regards numbers and quality of exhibits ever held at Ahmednagar. Total number of animals exhibited amounted to 585 horses and 417 cattle against 269 horses and 124 cattle in 189112 53. Depôts and Studs.13 64. Oats.14 APPENDIX I. HORSE-BREEDING.

Veterinary Captain Grainger delivered over charge on the 16th of April to Captain Williamson, Superintendent, Ahmadnagar Remount Rearing Depôt, who officiated as Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, till Veterinary Captain Morgan's arrival. Poona. Sholápur. Ahmadnagar. Shikárpur. 3. As proposed in this office report to Government, No. 3513, dated 10th December 1892, the Superintendent has given his tour in a tabular form (Appendix XVIII). He toured in the districts noted in the margin. He attended the horse and cattle shows held at Quetta, Ahmadnagar, Jacobabad, Chinchli, Sibi, Naushahro and Ahmedabad, and inspected the veterinary dispensaries at Nadiád, Ahmedabad and Karáchi. He visited besides Deesa, Pálanpur, Bháv- nagar, Bombay, Saháranpur, Bábugarh and Karnál. The visits to the three places last named were sanctioned in Government Resolution No. 9584, dated 7th December 1892. His tours and visits appear to have been well-planned and his movements active. 4. At the close of the year, the number of stallions stationed in the Presi- dency was 74 as against 76 at the end of the previous year. A Turkoman stallion has been purchased for the Hyderabad Local Board. This is believed to be the first instance in this Presidency of a stallion being owned by a Local Board. The existing number of stallions is considered inadequate and the Super- intendent intends purchasing 3 English and 12 Arabs shortly. 5. The effective number of stallions has risen slightly from 88.67 to 89.8, even though the total number (94) was less than that of the previous year (99). This is satisfactory. Casualties have decreased from 7.89 to 5.4 per cent. Stallions are now regularly exercised. By arrangement with the Inspector- General, stallions for this Presidency will be selected by the Superintendent, and the necessity of costly transfers will in future be avoided. Veterinary Assistants in charge grant-in-aid dispensaries have systematically supervised the feeding of stallions located at their stations. 6. Though the total number of mares covered by horse and pony stallions (including the Beluchistan stud) has slightly risen, the number being 3,109 as against 3,087 in the previous year, there is a considerable fall in the number of mares covered in Gujarát and in Sind and Cutch, which is not explained in the report. The average number of covered mares per horse has also fallen from 34.81 to 34.62, which is somewhat remarkable when the increase in effective strength of stallions is considered. The Deccan, with 26.57 mares per stallion, has the lowest average, the averages in Gujarát, Sind and Cutch and Beluchi- stan being respectively 33, 32.08 and 55.64, this last figure reaching the ordinary maximum permitted. 7. The number of mares branded rose from 809 to 929; but it is still below the figure (1,046) of 1890-91. The increase was general except in Gujarát, where last year there was a fall. The necessity of the recently proposed register of branded mares is well shown by the remarks in Veterinary Captain Morgan's paragraph 18. 8. 3,087 mares were covered during the year 1891-92, with a result reported "unknown" in 30 per cent. of cases. Above half the number of mares are in Beluchistan, where there are no Inspectors. Results in 50 per cent. of the re- mainder were classed as "did not hold." These figures are not satisfactory30 produce (907) shows about 25 per cent. of deaths and abortions, the high death- rate being due to great mortality in young stock in the Deccan, which is res- ponsible for 80 per centAnnual Administration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department in the Bombay Presidency and Beluchistan for 1892-93. No. 295. REVENUE DEPARTMENT. Bombay Castle, 12th January 1894. Memorandum from the Military Department of the Secretariat, No. 761-G., dated 11th May 18932 arranged to purchase 12 Arab stallions locally. A Turkoman stallion was purchased during the year for the Hyderabad Local Board. His Excellency the Governor in Council trusts that the excellent example thus set by the Hyderabad Board will be followed by other local bodies. As remarked by the Survey Commissioner and Director of Land Records and Agriculture, the pro- duce results cannot be regarded as satisfactory, only 907 foals, including 229 deaths or abortions, being reported out of a total of 3,087 mares covered by horses in 1891-92. Of the remainder, 1,240 are reported as "not held," and in 940 cases the results were not known. Future reports are, however, expected to show better results as greater care is being now taken in the matter of exercise and feed of stallions. Proposals have also been laid before Govern- ment with a view to improve the present system of produce registration, which is obviously very defective. As regards mule-breeding also, the produce statistics are unreliable, as there are no special Inspectors employed in Sind to which Province the industry is at present mainly confined. The decrease in the total number (846) of mares covered by donkey stallions in 1892-93 as com- pared with the number (1,019) in 1891-92 is stated to be due to sickness among the stallions. The number of coverings in the Deccan, however, rose from 1 to 28. The Superintendent hopes to make mule-breeding popular in this part of the Presidency by creating a market for mules. 2.The number of branded mares for horse and pony breeding on the register on 31st March 1892 amounted to 13,125. During the year under report a careful census of the branded mares was taken in eight districts of the Presi- dency, and as a result of it 2,199 mares were found to have died, or been sold or otherwise disposed of. The numbers in Sind, Beluchistan, Khándesh, and Cutch have not yet been checked owing to paucity of Inspectors. Beluchistan has, however, now been removed from the jurisdiction of the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay, and two more Inspectors have been sanctioned for the Department by Government Resolution No. 2525, dated 11th April 1893. Proposals have also been submitted to Government for the institution of a proper village register of branded mares. These measures will, no doubt, conduce to more accurate results. In the course of his tour which was well arranged, the Superintendent branded 929 mares for horse and pony-breeding and 141 mares for mule-breeding. The total numbers of branded mares on the register at the end of the year stood at 11,855 for horse and pony-breeding and 988 for mule-breeding. 3.There was a satisfactory increase in the number (351) of country bred remounts purchased at the several horse-shows during 1892-93 for this Presi- dency as compared with the figure (251) of 1891-92. Only 57 of the animals purchased could be ascertained to have been the produce of Government stallions. The remarks in paragraph 28 of the Superintendent's report as to the advisability of deputing a purchasing officer from Bombay to attend the horse- shows held in Sind and in paragraph 58 regarding the Ahmednagar Remount- rearing Depot should be communicated to the Military Department. The Com- missariat Department purchased 151 mules for transport purposes during the year under report. The number of colts, the property of breeders, castrated by Government salutris was 326 against 320 in the preceding year. 4.The total expenditure of the Department rose from Rs. 66,767 in 1891-92 to Rs. 68,268 in the year under report, of which the Provincial share amounted to Rs. 43,118 against Rs. 42,844 in the preceding year. Of the remainder, Rs. 14,145 were contributed by Local Funds and Rs. 11,005 from Imperial Revenues. The increase of expenditure was mainly on account of feed and keep of stallions. The average cost under this head per horse stallion amounted to Rs. 395 and for a donkey stallion to Rs. 291 as compared with Rs. 386 and Rs. 254 respectively in 1891-92. The attention of the Superin- tendent should be invited to the remarks on this subject made by the Survey Commissioner and Director in paragraph 12 of his review.
3 5. Veterinary Captain Morgan has submitted a valuable and interesting report and has shown commendable activity and zeal in the work of his Depart- ment and Government will watch with interest the progress of the experiments in fodder crops and sheep-breeding instituted by him at his own expense. Separate proposals should be submitted to Government regarding the question of the training of syces at the Ahmednagar Depôt. Future reports of the Civil Veterinary Department will have to be submitted in accordance with the rules and forms sanctioned in Government Resolution No. 8667, dated 27th November 1893. W. L.

Tables XVII. to XXI. are not applicable to this Presidency; hence they are not given. Cost of the Department. 92. Table XXVIII. shows the total cost of the department during the year under report which amounts to Rs. 60,581-1-10 as against Rs. 68,268-3-9 in 1892-93, showing a decrease of Rs. 7,687-1-11. The outlay has been divided under the following sub- heads :14 102. Charbon symptomatique.15 111. Beluchistan.16 the Deccan is capable of carrying a sheep far and away superior to the idigenous breed, both in wool and mutton-producing qualities but stock, to be superior to that bred and kept by the ordinary shepherd of the country, must be liberally fed and intelligently crossed17 130. The total number of animals treated amounted to 1,203 against 854 last year, of which 54 only were in-patients and the remaining (1,149) out- patients. 131. The Veterinary Graduate in paragraph 3 of his report states that aptha-epizootica was raging throughout the year, whereas only 85 cases were treated by him and no report received from the district officials to the effect that the disease was present. 132. Fifty-one fairs and cattle markets were visited and the Government stallions attended to. 133. No case of castration is reported. 134. The increase in the number of patients is most satisfactory. But the Graduate, in his report, treats of irrelevant matter and his figures are very inaccurate. 135. Receipts Rs. 3,103-6-2. Expenditure Rs. 1,453-4-10. Balance Rs. 1,650-1-4. Jalgaon. 136. The Graduate in charge of this dispensary was appointed in July 1893, and the dispensary was not opened until Janu- ary 1894. He worked in the meantime at Dhulia during the absence, on leave, of the Dhulia Veterinary Graduate and was in the district for three months. 137. The total number of animals treated amounted to 228, which is very fair considering the short time the dispensary has been in existence. 138. A slight outbreak of aptha-epizootica was treated by him with satisfactory results. 139. The Graduate's attention should be called to the fact that forms used by him are irregular. 140. Receipts Rs. 1,175-0-0. Expenditure Rs. 1,142-8-7. Balance Rs. 32-7-5. Bhadgaon. 141. Opened in October 1893. The total number of animals treated amounted to 340, a very satisfactory beginning. The Veterinary Graduate treated outbreaks of aptha-epi- zootica and rinderpest, 115 cases of the former and 22 of the latter, none of which were reported by the District officials to this office. 142. No case of castration is reported. 143. Receipts Rs. 1,415-0-0. Expenditure Rs. 1,358-1-10. Balance Rs. 56-4-2. Belgaum. 144. This dispensary was inspected by me on the 1st of June 1893 and was in good working order. The site is unsuitable, as there is practically no accommodation for in-patients. 145. The total number of animals treated amounted to 821 against 493 last year, the in-patients only numbering 31. 146. A slight outbreak of aptha-epizootica and rinderpest amongst the Municipality bullocks was treated by the Veterinary Graduate and the number of visits paid to owners' stables amounted to 93. Co-operation with the Itinerat- ing Veterinary Graduate was not necessary, but the latter appears to have done good work in sending cattle for treatment to the dispensary. 147. Eleven cases of castration are reported, which is satisfactory. 148. Receipts Rs. 2,370-11-5. Expenditure Rs. 2,299-0-6. Balance Rs. 71-10-11. Belgaum (Itinerating). 149. The Veterinary Graduate's report embraces a period extending over 11 months as he was in charge of the dispensary for one month. 150. The total number of animals treated amounts to 1,050 against 334 last year. Two slight outbreaks of aptha-epizootica and rinderpest were B 57918 treated by the Graduate, "but the district throughout the year appears to have been particularly healthy. 151. Four cases of castration are reported. 152. Receipts Rs. 804-0-0 and Expenditure Rs. 804-0-0. Hyderabad. 153. This dispensary was opened on the 14th of May 1893 and inspected by me on the 24th of January 1894. It was in good working order and in a thoroughly clean and sanitary state. The present site as a temporary measure is suitable although the accom- modation for in-patients is limited. 154. The total number of animals treated amounted to 825, of which only 60 were in-patients. 155. The Veterinary Graduate treated outbreaks of aptha-epizootica, attended the Shikárpur and Moro Horse Shows and paid 108 visits to owners' stables. The report reflects great credit on him. It is clear and concise and states what measures he has adopted to make the institution popular. 156. The Hyderabad Local Board have sent a man to the Bombay Veterinary College to. qualify himself for the post of Itinerating Veterinary Graduate. 157. Receipts Rs. 2,863-5-0. Expenditure Rs. 2,056-7-9. Balance Rs. 806-13-3. Karachi. 158. This dispensary was inspected by me on the 20th of January 1894 and found to be in good working order. The sanitary arrangements are somewhat defective and the accom- modation for in-patients quite inadequate. The proposed site for the new dispensary is suitable in every way and I would strongly urge the necessity of endeavouring by private subscription and otherwise to collect sufficient funds to complete the work as soon as possible. The total number of animals treated amounted to 1,581 against 290 last year. This is the largest number that has been treated at any dispensary and shows a marked increase over last year. 159. Only one case of rinderpest, three of aptha-epizootica and three of glanders have occurred in the district. The Veterinary Graduate paid a visit to Dasai Kalian's village, 18 miles from Karáchi, to investigate a disease present- ing symptoms of "Rot" amongst goats which had been prevalent for two years. He is of opinion that it is due to bad pasturage and unclean feeding, but no figures are given as to the mortality, &c. He treated the animals of the Police, Municipality, Zoological Gardens, and examined all Police remounts prior to purchase. His services were also called into requisition to assist in the purchase of dairy cattle for the Bombay and Ceylon Governments. 160. Only three cases of castration are reported. 161. The report reflects great credit on the Veterinary Graduate, and the rapid increase of patients denotes that he is carrying on the duties in an intel- ligent and satisfactory manner and making the institution thoroughly popular. 162. Receipts Rs. 3,655-0-0. Expenditure Rs. 3,157-3-10. Balance Rs. 497-12-2. Shikárpur. 163. I inspected this dispensary on the 12th of January 1894 and found it to be in fair working order. The present site is too far from the city and bazár, and it is to be hoped that the proposed change to a larger and more conveniently situated site will be beneficial. Opened on the 15th of May 1893. The total number of cases since that date amounts to 718, a most satisfactory beginning. 164. One case of aptha-epizootica was treated by the Veterinary Graduate. He attended the Shikárpur Horse Show, paid frequent visits to sick animals at owners' stables, visited the Government stallions at Shikárpur, Khairpur, Nathai Shah and Lárkhána. 165. No case of castration is reported. 166. Receipts Rs. 2,660-0-0. Expenditure Rs. 2,488-5-0. Balance Rs. 171-11-0.
19 Ahmedabad. 167. The total number of patients rose from 916 last year to 1,128 in 1893-94, of which only 74 were in-patients. The increase is most satisfactory, but the proportion of in-patients is very small. The Veterinary Graduate during the year attended the Friday weekly market and it is probably due to the careful way that this duty was performed that the city of Ahmedabad was free from epidemics during the year. He attended a very mild outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the Cantonment and surrounding villages and outbreaks of contagious disease in the Sánand, Dholka and Parántij Tálukas. It is to be regretted that he did not diagnose the disease in the above tálukas. This omission reduces the value of his report very considerably, as in this particular instance valuable brood mares died and much confusion appears to have arisen in the district reports as to what the disease really was. He inspected the horses belonging to the Police, paid 98 visits to owners' houses, attended the Government stallions and visited the "Panjrápol" once a week. 168. No cases of castration are reported. 169. The Graduate has done good work during the year. It is to be hoped that when the new dispensary is constructed there will be an increase of in-patients. As Sir Dinsha Manekji Petit has most generously promised the sum of Rs. 10,000 towards the new dispensary, it is to be hoped that the work will be commenced at once as the present site is unsuitable in many ways. 170. Receipts Rs. 3,209-1-0. Expenditure Rs. 1,427-12-5. Balance Rs. 1,781-4-7. Nadiád. 171. The total number of patients treated amounted to 1,208 against 1,141 last year. The new dispensary, the gift of Ráo Bahádur Becherdas Viharidas, will, shortly, be open- ed. The accommodation for in-patients is very limited, and not, in my opinion, sufficient for the wants of the place. The Graduate during the year attended one outbreak of "Gloss Anthrax" at Wanthavli in the Mehmadabad Táluka, of which 75 animals died. He paid 58 visits to owners' stables and attended the Government stallion at Kaira. Only five cases of aptha-epizootica and four of anthrax occurred in the district. 172. Three cases of castration are reported. 173. The institution is evidently gaining in popularity, judging from the use made of it by the surrounding villages. The report taken as a whole is favourable. 174. Receipts Rs. 1,939-12-0. Expenditure Rs. 1,381-7-1. Balance Rs. 558-4-11. Kaira (Itinerating). 175. From the report received from the Itinerating Veterinary Graduate, he took charge of the dispensary on the 4th of Febru- ary 1894. He toured for 1½ months at Mahej, Kaira, and Mátar, halting at each place 15 days. No cattle fairs or shows were visited by him and he attended the Government stallion at Kaira. There appears to have been no method in his movements and care should be taken in future that unless outbreaks of disease prevent, he should adhere to a tour laid down by the Committee. 50 animals in all were treated by him. 176. Receipts Rs. 731-15-11. Expenditure Rs. 153-3-7. Balance Rs. 578-12-4. Summary. 177. Considerable progress has been made in-the Presidency under this head during the past year and the total number of animals treated during the year under report amounts to 9,843 against 4,466 in 1892-93 (vide Table XXIV). The percentage of cured and relieved cases is high and unknown results comparatively smaller, denoting that greater care is exercised in the management of these institutions. The Graduates have been active and prompt in dealing with outbreaks of contagious disease and they have endeavoured to instil into the minds of villagers the precautionary measures to be adopted when outbreaks occur and otherwise afforded help and advice. The very small number of castrations reported (18) is to be regretted, as this is without doubt one of the chief duties of the Veterinary Graduate, particularly of those situated in the middle of the horse-breeding
20 districts. I would humbly suggest in future that all reports prior to being submitted be briefly criticised by the President of the Dispensary Committee and that all figures be checked. The majority received this year were very inaccurate, the appendices and the body of the report not tallying. (Tables XXIV, XXV and XXVI in connection with the dispensaries are attached.) Tours of the Superintendent. 178. A reference to the Appendix XXVII will show the exact places visited by me during the year under report and a general summary of each district with regard to its horse-breeding capabilities is given below. Poona. 179. Poona.21 Ahmedabad. 185. Ahmedabad may be classed as fair. Horse-breeding in this district appears to have received a severe check within the last few years for which there is no accounting, and matters have been made considerably worse by an outbreak of "Anthrax" last cold weather, which either caused the death of several good mares or led to their being sold with a view of getting them out of the infected district, and it will, probably, take years for this tract of country to recover the shock. I made a detailed tour, removed all old and unsuitable stallions, purchased all suitable young stock, and have endeavoured by all means in my power to again revive and improve the industry. This falling off is to be regretted, as the young stock in the nursery purchased from this district compare more than favourably with those from other parts of the Presidency. It is however satisfactory to note that there are still a number of men in this particular tract who are keen on horses and horse-breeding. Sind. 186. Sind.22 189. Our kind reception by the Chiefs and the keenness displayed by them in all matters connected with horse-breeding will, I trust, lead to useful results; and I hope that, should occasion arise, they will avail themselves of the help and services of this department.

23 yards from this block. They are, however, on high ground, dry, well drained and well ventilated, and the horses in them remain perfectly healthy throughout the year. I need hardly point out that the loss to Government is considerable, and it is most unsatisfactory for me to endeavour to get freshly landed English and Arab horses in a fit state to issue when the conditions are so unfavourable. 198.

No. A/2985 OF 1894. Poona, 27th September 1894. Submitted to Government. 2. During the year under report Baluchistán was made into a separate charge and the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, handed over the Baluchistán stallions and records on the 15th February last. Hence in this review the Baluchistán figures have been excluded. *Government Resolution No. 8667, dated 27th Novem- ber 1893, Revenue Depart- ment. 3. The report under review has been framed as far as possible in accord- ance with the form* laid down by the Goverment of India and deals with horse-breeding, cattle-breeding, veterinary dispensaries, and horse and cattle shows. Veterinary Captain Morgan was in charge of the Department during the whole of the year under report. Sholápur, Poona, Belgaum, Dhárwár, Bijápur, Khándesh, Násik, Ahmadnagar, Ahmad- abad, Shikárpur, Upper Sind Frontier, Hyderabad, Balu- chistan, Kathiáwár, Mahi Kántha. 4. The Superintendent toured in the districts and states marginally noted. It is impossible for him to minutely inspect his whole charge during each year. He travelled 681 miles by road, 12,268 miles by rail and 1,002 miles by boat, making a total of 13,951 miles. The details of his tours are given in a tabular statement which gives all the information required by the Government of India. The result of the Superintendent's observations during his tours is given in paragraphs 178 to 189 of his report which indicate the districts in which the best results are likely to be attained in horse-breeding. A special feature in his tour was his visit to Káthiáwár, which was visited with a view to purchasing young stock for the Rearing Depôt. Government stepping in as a purchaser must awaken a new interest in horse-breeding among the Káthiáwár Chiefs and will tend to induce them to breed up to a given standard and employ none but the best stallions. 5. The Poona and Ahmadnagar districts are in the estimation of the Superintendent the best horse-breeding districts of the Presidency proper. The establishment of the rearing nursery at Ahmadnagar has tended and undoubtedly will further tend to stimulate the enterprize in the surrounding districts. Very little progress has been made in horses-breeding in Khándesh although Government stallions have been stationed there for more than 30 years. The Superintendent attributes this to the unsuitability of the stallions, the mares being undersized ponies, which, though excellent, were not, with few excep- tions, "fit to mate with anything larger than a 13-2 pony, and the majority not even large enough for this." The experiment which the Superintendent proposes to make of introducing one or two country-bred pony-stallions into these districts seems commendable and likely to succeed. There seems little doubt that if sound well-shaped hardy pony stallions were available, breeders would be keen to secure their services. At any rate the experiment is worthy of fair and full trial. The central and northern parts of the Násik district have apparently small pony mares similar to those of Khándesh, and there also thoroughly good country-bred pony stallions might be tried advantageously. Parts of the Sholápur district on the other hand seem to have mares suitable for the larger stallions. Although in Ahmadabad the horse-show has collapsed, and horse- breeding seems to have received a severe check within the last few years for which it is difficult to account and matters have been made considerably worse by the outbreak of anthrax last cold season, the Superintendent is hopeful of the district for horse-breeding. He removed all old and unsuitable stallions, purchased suitable young stock and strove to revive and improve the industry. His efforts may be successful, as he says, "there are still a number of men B 57951 in this particular tract who are keen on horses and horse-breeding." The Superintendent thinks that the province of Sind has great possibilities for successful horse-breeding and that there is a large tract of country on the right bank of the Indus which requires special attention. Many wealthy zamindárs of this district are reported to be displaying extreme interest in horse-breeding and touring stallions in a modified form have been tried with great success. 6. There were 74 stallions on the register at the commencement of the year and 73 at its close. Two thorough-breds and one hackney have been received from England which are stated to be suitable in every way. The Superintendent experienced great difficulty in obtaining pure-bred, large-boned Arabs and was unable to complete the number required for the Presidency. A very high class country-bred stallion which cost Rs. 450 was purchased at the Shikárpur show. This first experiment of a country-bred stallion of doubtful origin being used in this Presidency will be watched with interest. Success may be more certain in this case than that attending the use of half bred imported horses, and in view of the patent failure reported on of imported stallions as foal-getters it is a question to be proved whether country-bred sires would not be more satisfactory in this respect. 7. The effective number of stallions actually at stud work was 86.6 per cent. of the total number against 95.5 per cent. last year. The Superintendent ought to have clearly explained this falling off. Casualties were the same as last year, i. e., 5.4 per cent. Six unserviceable stallions were sold as against four last year. Under special arrangement with the Government of India, the Jacob- abad stallions were removed to Quetta for the hot weather with satisfactory results. With reference to suitable stock for the Presidency, it appears that out of 72 remounts inspected 30 were rejected as unsuitable. This is a high propor- tion and is explained as due to the fact that young stock were bought with a view to starting the nursery at Ahmadnagar which ought not to have been purchased. Some of the young stock were the produce of small Arab galloways and did not grow to the size demanded for army remounts but they were good shapely animals which were readily purchased by the public and realized an average price of Rs. 320. The Superintendent is endeavouring to weed out the galloway stallions and to replace them by pure-bred large-boned horses whose stock will grow into suitable remounts. The Norfolk-trotter stands first as the producer of the most suitable stock for the army, next comes the thorough-bred English stallion, and last the Arab. The reason why the Arab stallion takes so low a place, even below that of unknown stallions, is explained above. It would seem advisable to show separately the Norfolk-trotter and the hackney which are different classes of horses, but are in the returns classed together; for it seems probable that a proportion of the young stock accepted as remounts and classed as the produce of the Norfolk-trotter, was actually got by pure-bred hackneys. 8. The number of mares covered by horse and pony stallions fell from 2,034 last year to 2,017 this year. There has been a considerable falling off in the number of mares covered in Gujarát, presumably owing to the severe out- break of anthrax. In Cutch and Sind the number rose 14 per cent. The average number of covered mares rose from 28.85 last year to 31.90 per stallion this year. This shows an improvement, but the stallions on an average are still very far from being fully employed. 9. The Superintendent branded in all 1,233 mares during the year inclu- sive of the figures for Baluchistán. This gives an increase of 163 mares over the previous year's figures and is due to the large number of mares branded for mule-breeding in Sind and Cutch. There were considerably fewer mares branded in the Deccan and more than last year in Gujarát. The large decrease in the number of mares branded in the Deccan for horse-breeding, from 236 last year to 57 this year, should have been explained. 10. The number of mares covered during 1892-93 was 2,034. The results noted below of the average number of mares covered by each horse are exceed- ingly disappointing:52 Average produce per stallion ... ... ... 7.59 Average number of mares "not held" per stallion ... 14.51 Average "unknown results" per stallion ... ... 6.75 Average number of mares covered per stallion ... 28.85 The average produce per stallion fell from 11.95 to 7.58. This remarkable falling off is explained by the Superintendent as being due (1) to inaccurate returns, (2) to no Inspectors in Sind and Cutch, and (3) to a large number of stallions on the register which are worn out and uncertain foal-getters. As regards inaccurate returns if the figures given in the report are not strictly correct, then they should be entirely eliminated, as incorrect figures only mislead and force one to conclusions which may be quite contrary to the true facts. It would be better to admit at once that trustworthy figures are not available. The absence of Inspectors in Sind and Cutch does not sufficiently explain the matter. As regards worn out stallions, it appears that the Superintendent has taken active steps to remove what appears the chief cause of the poor results by selling the least serviceable of the stallions. The stallions on the registers are not fully worked, and at the same time the Superintendent is anxious to buy Arab sires of a certain class, the inference is that a considerable proportion of the stallions at stud work is unreliable as foal-getters or unsuitable in other ways and it is necessary to replace them. The Superintendent's tabulated statement of produce returns shows, as far as the figures may be reliable, that the thorough- bred English stallion is on the average the surest stock-getter. The average comparative produce returns of different breeds of stallions are summarized below :53 stallion are: mule foals 4.93, mares not held 25.03, results not known 10.73, total number of mares covered per donkey stallion 40.69. 14. The average cost of maintenance of each horse and pony stallion was Rs. 346, that is, Rs. 28 less than last year, not 48 as stated by the Superintendent, who has included Baluchistán figures. For donkey stallions the cost was Rs. 279, that is, Rs. 14 less than last year and not 11 as stated by the Superintendent The general average cost is still high and this the Superintendent explains as being due to inclusion of cost of repairs to stables and to heavy transport expenses incurred in moving stallions. To get a correct idea of the cost of maintaining stallions, the transit expenses and those of repairing stables, &c., should be shown separately. 15. The total expenditure of the Department amounted to Rs. 60,581. This shows a saving of Rs. 7,687 over the previous year, but last year's expen- diture included the figures for Baluchistán. The Superintendent has not shown how much of the saving is due to the separation of Baluchistán. Local funds contributed Rs. 12,200. 16. The Superintendent has given a detailed description of horse and cattle shows in the Presidency; but as the reports of each show are separately submitted to Government and reviewed in this office, further comments are unnecessary, 17. The new form of cattle-disease report was adopted during the year and outbreaks of disease were promptly reported on occurrence. During the 6 months ending 31st March last 3,927 animals were reported attacked with contagious and infectious diseases. Of the above number 1,703 died, 3,293 being treated by veterinary graduates and 634 by the owners. The diseases were anthrax, rinderpest, foot and mouth disease, pleuro-pneumonia and charbon symptomatique. The Kolába district suffered most. 18. The work done at veterinary dispensaries is making satisfactory progress. The Superintendent reports that he found the Dhulia dispensary in a dirty unsanitary state, due to its being incorporated with the Pánjrápol. He thinks the state of the Belgaum dispensary unsuitable, as there is practically no accommodation for in-patients. The sanitary arrangements of the Karáchi dis- pensary are reported to be defective and the accommodation for in-patients quite inadequate. The Superintendent considers the accommodation for in-patients at the new dispensary at Nadiád insufficient for the requirements of the place. The work of the veterinary graduates in charge of the dispensaries at Hyderabad, Karáchi and Ahmadabad is favourably reported on. The total number of cases treated at dispensaries amounted to 9,843 as against 4,466 in the previous year. The percentage of cured and relieved amounted to nearly 85. The Superintendent is right in suggesting that all reports prior to being submitted should be briefly criticised by the Presidents of the dispensary committees and all figures checked as the majority received this year were very inaccurate. 19. Veterinary Captain Morgan's experiments on sheep-breeding are interesting and his remarks on fodder crops deserve attention. The distribu- tion of Guinea grass roots for cultivation in villages and stallion stands is specially commendable. The Superintendent's remarks on the unhealthy character of the stallion stables at Ahmadnagar should call for a separate report on the subject. The report as to the health and condition of the young stock at the rearing depôt is particularly satisfactory. The various tables appended to the report are based on the Government of India form, but this year's experience in compiling them has shown that the forms of some of these tables can be improved upon without sacrificing details. A separate report as to the modifications required will be submitted in consultation with the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department. C. W.

Annual Administration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department in the Bombay Presidency for 1893-94. No. 1473 of 1895. REVENUE DEPARTMENT Bombay Castle, 20th February 1895. Letter from the Survey Commissioner and Director of Land Records and Agriculture, No. A( 2 ) by horses in 1892-93. Of the remainder 1,023 are reported as "not held," and in 476 cases the results were not known. The average known produce per stallion also fell from 11.95 to 7.58. These poor results are attributed to want of Inspectors in Sind and Cutch, and the rendering of inaccurate produce re- turns, as also to the existence of a large number of worn out and uncertain foal- getters on the registers. With a view to secure improved results, measures have been taken by the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, to weed out all stallions of doubtful foal-getting powers. Government trust that the registration of mares and their produce will be placed on a more satisfactory footing when orders are passed on the proposals called for in paragraph 5 of Government Resolution No. 4343, dated 17th May 1894. The Survey Commissioner and Director of Land Records and Agriculture should be requested to expedite the submission of these proposals. 3. It is satisfactory to note that mule-breeding is gradually becoming popular even in tracts where it was hitherto unknown. This is the first year in which pony mares were covered by donkey stallions in Gujarát and eleven are reported to have been covered. The number of coverings in the Deccan rose from 1 in 1891-92 and 28 in 1892-93 to 45 in 1893-94. The Khándesh and Shikárpur Local Boards, the Khairpur State, and Mr. Gulam Husain Khán, a Zamindár in Sind, have also expressed their willingness to purchase donkey stallions. Government are at the same time glad to learn that the experiment of sending donkey stallions on tour with the Inspectors has proved successful. The arrangement introduced during the year under which all the English stallions in Sind were moved during the hot weather to Quetta, has been productive of good results. 4. The mares branded for horse, pony and mule-breeding on the register on 31st March 1893 numbered respectively 4,494, 6,172 and 973. In the course of his tour during the year under report, the Superintendent branded 533 mares for horse and pony-breeding and 335 for mule-breeding in addition to 365 mares branded by him in Baluchistan, i. e., in all 1,233 against 1,070 in 1892-93. Excluding 388 mares for horse and pony-breeding removed from the register by death or sale during the year under report, the total numbers of branded mares at the end of the year stood at 10,811 for horse and pony-breeding and 1,308 for mule-breeding. 5. There was a satisfactory increase in the number (461) of country-bred remounts purchased during 1893-94 for the Army, the Police and the Remount Rearing Depôt as compared with 351 in 1892-93. Of the number purchased 117 animals were ascertained to be the produce of Government stallions as against 57 during the previous year. These figures are believed to be much below the mark as it is found that in several cases the covering and produce certificates are lost or destroyed or become illegible, and the animals are there- fore entered as being of unknown parentage. The defect in the present system will, it is hoped, be remedied to some extent by the adoption of the parchment certificate which the Superintendent has introduced. The Military and Judicial Departments should be requested to invite the attention of purchasing officers to the remarks made by Veterinary Captain Morgan in paragraph 89 of his report in regard to the filling up of this certificate. The number of colts castrated by Veterinary Assistants and salutris was 109 as against 326 in 1892-93. The Veterinary Assistants employed in the districts do not appear to have been sufficiently active in impressing on owners of colts the expediency of castrating them and their attention has been drawn to the matter by the Superintendent. 6. The total expenditure of the Department fell from Rs. 68,268 in 1892-93 to Rs. 60,581 in the year under report. The figure for the former year, however, included the expenditure for Baluchistan, and the Superintendent should have shown how much of the saving in the latter year was due to exclu- sion of that province from his jurisdiction. Of the total expenditure the Pro- vincial share amounts to Rs. 35,767, and Rs. 12,201 and Rs. 12,613 were debited to Local Funds and Imperial Revenues respectively. The attention of the Superintendent should be drawn to the remarks made by Colonel Godfrey in paragraph 14 of his memorandum regarding the method of showing the average cost of maintenance of stallions. In view of the circumstances brought to notice
( 3 ) in paragraph 197 of the Superintendent's report, His Excellency in Council has every desire that the work of constructing new stallion stables at Ahmednagar should be commenced without delay, but he is not prepared even under those circumstances to approve of extravagant designs. There is nothing to delay the building of new stables, except the submission of a design suitable to the purpose and the financial ability of Government. 7. During the year under report the Superintendent inspected most of the Veterinary Dispensaries in the Presidency, and be has embodied in his report a review of the working of these institutions. The Collectors concerned should be requested to draw the attention of the Dispensary Committees to the remarks made by the Superintendent, and especially to his suggestion that the reports of the dispensaries should, prior to submission to him, be briefly criticised, and that all figures entered therein should be checked, by the Presidents of the Committees concerned. 8. Veterinary Captain Morgan has submitted an extremely interesting report, evincing a creditable activity on his part in acquainting himself with the conditions that prevail in, and the needs of, different parts of the Presidency. His Excellency in Council is satisfied that under his supervision, direction and advice intelligent progress in a marked degree is being made in the breeding and treatment of horses and cattle in this Presidency, and that the interest he dis- plays in his charge will communicate itself to the officers and owners with whom his work brings him into relation. The thanks of Government are due and should be conveyed to Veterinary Captain Morgan for the very valuable experi- ments in sheep-breeding and in the production of fodder crops which he is con- ducting at his own expense ; and the Director of Land Records and Agricul- ture should enquire if it is possible for Government to give Veterinary Captain Morgan any assistance in these matters.

GOVERNMENT OF BOMBAY. ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT FOR THE OFFICIAL YEAR 1894-95. PART I.4 Owing to the increased price sanctioned by Government for Arab sires, this season definite arrangements have been made with the dealer Abdulla bin Fariss to import specially for this department. Number removed from re- gisters. 4. The number of casualties and the diseases from which stallions died are given in Table II. The general percentage was 13.04 for horse and 14.81 for pony. Two stallions died and eight were destroyed for the reasons given in the table. 5. Table III shows that eight stallions were disposed of by sale for reasons given against each in the remarks column, calculated to render them unfit for stud purposes. Number present at close of year. 6. At the close of the year under report the following number of stallions were present:[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page]

5 Demand for Stallions. 13. Horse-breeding continues to make satisfactory progress in the Deccan, Sind, and Cutch. Owing to a further outbreak of anthrax this year in Gujarát a considerable falling off is noticeable. Stallions which produce the most suitable stock for the Army. 14. Table V. shows that a larger percentage of Arab and thorough-bred stock were drafted to British Regiments than stock got by Norfolk Trotters. The majority of those under the heading " unknown " are without doubt, from their make and shape, the get of Arabs and thorough-breds. The country-bred rejections sold this year were an old mare by " Pickle," which realised Rs. 200, and one young stock Rs. 520. (2).6 19. No donkey stallions were sold during the year (vide Table VIII). Number present at close of year. 20. The strength of the donkey stallions as it stood on the 1st April 1895 is shown in the following table:7 26. There is a slight increase of Rs. 11-1-7 per stallion, due to the number of transfers and changes which have taken place during the year. It has been found impossible to get the details for transit, maintenance, &c., of Government stallions this year in such a form as to show each item separately. Arrange- ments have been made to show these items separately next year. (2.)8 Number served by Govern- ment Stallions. 32. The total number of branded mares served by Government stallions during the year under report is 1,869 as against 2,017 last year. (3).9 fact that only 154 cattle were exhibited against 405 in 1893. The horse show was the most successful that has ever been held in the Deccan, and proves that Ahmednagar is a more suitable centre than Poona for holding it. Classes.10 purchased 30 for Police purposes. The show, which was held for the first time with a view of ascertaining the class of mare in the district, was most satisfactory, as it opens out a fresh field for the introduction of Government stallions, and promises in time to become one of the best breeding districts in Sind. I was very much surprised at the large number and size of the mares and the keenness evinced by the Zamindárs, several of whom have already promised to make paddocks and give their young stock complete liberty. Naushahro-Moro. 44. Commenced on the 4th of February 1895. The total number of animals exhibited amounted to 1,155 against 806 last year (588 horses, 39 mules, 392 cattle, 59 donkeys, 77 camels).

13 I think, be an accepted fact that there is more need for improving the cattle of the Deccan than in any other part of the Presidency; and yet any attempt would be worse than useless unless the natural conditions of the district could be so changed that an adequate supply of fodder could be procured in bad as well as good years. In the Central Division and in those parts of the Southern Division where the rainfall is moderate (the districts of heavy rainfall may be left out as unsuitable for breeding), the ordinary cultivator feeds his cattle almost entirely upon the fodder derived from his cultivated land. Here and there strips of country may be found where the villagers enjoy grazing rights and where horse- breeding is making some progress; but throughout the greater part of the Deccan where natural grazing exists, it is within forest limits and the grass is annually sold by auction and transported to military cantonments or large towns. Grass not worth cutting goes to waste as the admission of cattle into forest reserves tends to harm the trees. Few villages, now-a-days, have grazing grounds, and it would be interesting to know the amount of grass that grows on the common grazing ground of a Deccan village. You will, however, see plenty of cattle herded by two or three small boys grazing round each village. No man owns more than half a dozen breeding animals; consequently it would not pay him to herd them separately, and the result is that they run together and pro- miscuous breeding from immature parents follows. Under these conditions the mating of animals cannot be controlled and is never likely to be controlled in the Deccan, as the district is not a cattle-breeding one in the true sense of the word. A Deccan ryot keeps a cow or two because his family likes the milk, and the male offspring may, but most probably will not live to re-place his worn- out work bullocks. He is also a poor man living from hand to mouth, who, in a favourable season, sells his superfluous fodder. A season, however, of scant rainfall and scarcity comes at least once in five years, and a great many cattle, mostly the old work oxen and young calves, die on these occasions, and it is certain that almost all would die if the indigenous breed were not small, active, and exceptionally hardy. They have acquired these characteristics owing to the natural conditions of the districts where they are bred ; and as these natural conditions are unchangeable, it would, in my opinion, be disastrous to increase the size of the small cattle of a poor district or to change their cha- racter in any way except by using the best males of their own class, and as I have already pointed out this is almost impossible as mating cannot be controlled. In the Deccan we find well-to-do cultivators owning good work cattle. These, however, are not bred in the district, as the Deccan Kunbi knows full well he can buy cheaper than he can breed owing to the conditions already explained. The requirements of the well-to-do cultivators are met by an annual im- portation of large droves of Malvi and Khillari cattle, brought from Native State territory, north of Khándesh, where there is ample grazing, water, and natural shelter in the districts where these cattle are bred. The droves brought to the Deccan arrive generally about December and January, and are composed of bulls 4 or 5 years old. The cattle when sold to the cultivator are castrated before being broken to work, and may, therefore, be left out of count as having exerted any considerable influence in changing the characters of the indigenous breed. I have referred to the Malvi and Khillari cattle, because they are two separate and distinct breeds, although bred in the same district. They do not resemble each other except that they are both of medium size and evidently bred with a view of meeting the requirements of the well-to-do Deccan cultivator, who prefers them to any other breed, because they are spirited, active, strong, and equally good on the road and in the field. The breeds of cattle found through- out India are commonly supposed to be the result of haphazard breeding. This is not so; as every pure breed has a distinctive type and family likeness which only could be produced by careful breeding and by maintaining the pristine purity of the breed for many generations. The characteristics which distin- guish the Malvi and Khillari cattle from each other are so peculiar and so constant that they must have existed for generations. The same remark applies to the other pure breeds of the Presidency, especially to the massive cattle of the Krishna valley, to the Gir-breed of Káthiáwár (famed as a milk breed), to the heavy cattle bred in the Kachi hills and to those of Northern Gujárat; the two latter perhaps unsurpassed by any of the large breeds of India for transport B 41114 purposes. No one questions that there is room for great improvement in the average animal of even the larger and better breeds, but in my opinion, improve- ment can only be effected by maintaining the purity of each pure breed by breeding only from the best and by maintaining each breed in its own district or in a district where the surrounding natural conditions are suitable for success. No experienced stockman would attempt to breed Kachi or Guzerat cattle in the Deccan; they require other surroundings than trap rock and a limited supply of spear grass. In their own districts they do well, because they are surrounded by considerable tracts growing a fine quality of grass, ample shade and water, and the cultivated lands grow a greater variety of nutritious crops than in the Deccan. They are safe from famine, and it is practicable at all seasons of the year to give to full-grown and growing animals a liberal ration. The cattle are maintained in thriving conditions all the year round. Breeding animals are thus capable of producing a healthy vigorous offspring and the young stock are reared under conditions favourable to their perfect development. I have visited certain tracts of country in the Presidency proper, Sind, and Káthiáwár, where cattle have been bred for generations either for milk or draft purposes, where the conditions are favourable, where the zamindar and the ryot are wealthy, and where the breeds have been kept pure and distinct. I would wish to point out that in these favourable localities the owner will tell you with pride the pedigree of his cow or bull, and it is to these tracts of country I would humbly suggest that our attention be turned; but on what lines we should work, is to me a matter that requires most careful and deliberate consideration, as the facts which I have already gathered are such as to lead one to believe that owners have from generation to generation exercised more care and forethought in mating their cattle than they do their horses, and that they have been careful to keep the breeds pure and to keep such breeds in localities suitable for their perfect development. Cattle Fairs and Shows. Ahmednagar. 58. Commenced on the 10th November 1894 and held in conjunction with the horse show. Total number of animals exhibited amounted to 168 against 504 last year. Classes.15 of Násik and paid 51 visits to owners' houses. One case of glanders was reported, which occurred prior to the " Glanders and Farcy " Act was applied to Násik. This animal was taken away by the owner to a village called Khardi, and there treated until he died. No case of castration was reported. The institution is progressing favourably and the report satisfactory:16 Belgaum. 67. Veterinary Graduate Mr. Fernandez.17 was in charge of the Stationary Dispensary at Nadiád twice during the year. He attended outbreaks of gloss-anthrax and aptha epizootica, but appears to have received intimation too late to be of much service. Steps to prevent re- currence of this have already been taken by the District authorities. He paid 26 visits to owners' houses, and attended the Government stallion at Kaira. The outbreak of gloss-anthrax appears to have been of a serious type, as out of 87 animals attacked, 79 died. No cases of castration are reported. The Graduate's movements were active, and the report is a decided improvement on last year and denotes satisfactory progress :18 and has evidently done all in his power to make the institution popular and well known amongst cultivators. The report is very satisfactory. I trust that steps will be taken to arrange for the site north of the Post-office and that the new dispensary will be commenced without delay. Six cases of castration are reported :19 system is much to be condemned as the foals are weaned when three months old, starved, and lose their foal's flesh, a shock which the system never recovers. They are then tied up and fed on all kinds of fattening material without exercise or liberty, with the result that they neither develop nor attain the size they would have under more favourable conditions. GENERAL REMARKS. 80. District officers were particularly asked to furnish all returns, &c., required for the compilation of this report by the 20th April last, and I regret to state that complete returns were not received from Shikárpur until the 17th of June 1895. The following Veterinary Dispensary reports were not received until the dates mentioned against them :20 TABLE I. GOVERNMENT OF BOMBAY. MILITERY SECTION.

Veterinary Captain Morgan was in charge of the Department during the year under report, and though the report has been signed by Veterinary Lieutenant Larnder, the whole of the report, with the exception of the returns from Shikarpur, was compiled by the permanent incumbent. Ahmadabad, Kaira, Khandesh, Nasik, Ahmadnagar, Poona, Sholapur, Belgaum, Karachi, Hyderabad, Shikarpur, Upper Sind Frontier, Cutch, Káthiawar, Pálanpur, Kolhápur, Miraj, and Nizam's Territory. Ahmadnagar, Malegaon (Nizáim's Territory), Jacoba- bad, Talhár, and Moro. 3. The Superintendent's tour extended over 10,710 miles as against 13,951 done in the last year, but it was none the less satisfactory, and the difference seems to a great extent due to the Superintendent not having had to travel beyond the limits of the Presidency as in the previous year. In his tour the Superintendent travelled in the districts and states noted in the margin. In Kathiawar he paid, in company of the Remount Agent, a second visit to the state paddocks of Bhavnagar, Vankaner, Morvi, Palitana, and Wadhwan, and found a marked improvement in the general management of the stock. He purchased 10 head of young stock as against 11 in the previous year. He also paid a second visit to Cutch and purchased 6 head of young stock. The inspection of the Kolhapur state paddocks showed that the general management was faulty, and a thorough change in the present system appeared necessary to produce any good results. He visited and assisted at the shows held at the places noted in the margin. He inspected all the veterinary dispensaries except- ing the one at Surat established in the latter part of the year under report. He paid eight visits to Bom- bay in connection with the purchase of stallions and one to act as president of the examination committee of the Bombay Veterinary College. 4. The year commenced with 73 and ended with 67 stallions on the regis- ter. The Superintendent could not make up the deficit caused by the some- what large number of casualties (10) and sales (8) of old and worn-out or other- wise incapacitated stallions. The scarcity of high class Arab horses (by far the more numerous class of stallions used in this Presidency) which has of late been felt, was so great that the Superintendent could not purchase suitable Arab stallions for the maximum price (Rs. 1,500) fixed. Government have however, at the request of the Superintendent, raised the maximum price to Rs. 2,000, and the Superintendent has made definite arrangements to import Arab stallions specially for the Civil Veterinary Department. A country-bred pony stallion was purchased in the Bombay market. This is the second country- bred stallion in the Department. It is too early as yet to say anything positive as to their usefulness or otherwise. The Superintendent's remark that stallions should not be sent to this country until they are at least four years old is worthy of consideration. 5. The percentage of stallions actually at stud work further fell from 86.6 per cent to 83.2 per cent of the total number on the register, the effective number being 55.75 as against 63.22 in the previous year. The Superintendent has not clearly explained this falling off, but implies that it must be attributed to the keeping of a certain number of newly purchased stallions at the Ahmadnagar Depôt for acclimatization or treatment. As regards the suitability of stallions to produce remounts, the results shown are quite the reverse to those obtained in the previous year. The Arab stands first, followed by the thorough- bred English stallion, and the Norfolk trotter and Hackney which are classed together comes third as the producer of the most suitable stock for the army. The percentage of rejections was very small, being only 2.94 per cent of 68 horses inspected as against 41.6 per cent of 72 horses inspected in the previous year. B 41144 6. The number of mares covered by horse and pony stallions fell from 2,017 to 1,869, the decrease being probably due to the smaller number of stallions at work than in the previous year. This is borne out by the fact that the average number of mares covered per stallion rose from 31.90 to 33.52, and so far the work done by stallions has been more satisfactory than in the previous year, though it is still much below the standard. The Superintendent's remark regarding the demand for stallions, that in Gujarat a considerable falling off is noticeable, is not borne out by the figures. It is in Sind and Cutch that a considerable falling off (of 102 mares) is noticed, the average per stallion going down from 35.2 to 34.83. The Superintendent ought to have explained this decline. The only Local Board stallion owned by the Hyderabad Local Board did a fair amount of work, covering 32 mares as against 5 in the previous year. 7. The following table compares the covering results for the year under report with those for the previous year. The percentage of produce foaled has slightly improved ; it is nevertheless small, and the percentage of ' not held ' is considerably larger than it should be :45 9. Though castration shows a considerable increase over last year, the number of colts castrated is still unsatisfactory. Veterinary Assistants appear to have neglected this part of their duty. Among 15 Veterinary Assistants employed, only 19 colts were castrated46 16. By the end of the year under report 10 stationary and 5 itinerating veterinary dispensaries were at work, showing an increase of one dispensary in each of the two classes. The total number of animals treated rose from 9,843 to 13,936. The percentage of animals cured and relieved rose also from 85 to 86, which is creditable. The Veterinary Assistants in charge of these dispensaries are reported to have done good work, the Superintendent specially commending the work of the Veterinary Assistants in charge of the Ahmadabad and Karáchi dispensaries, The Dhulia and Jalgaon dispensaries are reported to have been in an unsanitary condition. The proposed new buildings, it is hoped, will remove this defect. The Belgaum dispensary worked under the same disadvantage of having a bad site as in the previous year. The Ahmad- abad and Surat dispensaries have now sufficiently large balances to entertain itine- rating Veterinary Assistants. The Superintendent's suggestion that cruelty cases should be sent to veterinary dispensaries for treatment is well worth consideration. The Shikárpur system of alternating the charges of stationary and itinerant Veterinary Assistants may be advantageously adopted in other districts where the duplicate staff of Veterinary Assistants is entertained with a view to give relief to the itinerant Assistant. 17. The Superintendent's remarks regarding cattle-breeding are both interesting and instructive. His opinion that rayats in some districts, well suited to cattle breeding, and where this has been carried on for generations, have shown much care in mating their cattle and keeping the breeds pure, seems to be well founded. 18. In quoting figures for former years for comparison, the Superintendent has again omitted to exclude the figures for Baluchistan, which has, since February 1894, been made a separate charge. The undersigned is also constrained to observe that the Superintendent's remarks are often too brief to explain the variations in figures. C. W. GODFREY, Colonel, Acting Survey Commissioner, and Director, Land Records and Agriculture,
Annual Administration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department in the Bombay Presidency for 1894-95. No. 118. REVENUE DEPARTMENT. Bombay Castle, 6th January 1896. Letter from the Survey Commissioner and Director of Land Records and Agricul- ture, No. A.2 previous year. This decrease appears to be due to the fact that a larger number had to be kept at the Ahmednagar Depôt for acclimatisation or treatment during the year under report. As remarked by the Survey Commissioner and Director of Land Records and Agriculture, the Superintendent is not correct in stating that a considerable decline in the demand for the services of the stallions is noticeable in Gujarát. The following figures show the average number of mares covered per stallion employed :3 it is hoped that the measures already taken by the Superintendent and the orders passed in paragraph 5 of Government Resolution No. 1473, dated 20th February 1895, will conduce to more accurate information on this point. During the year under report 51 mules were purchased by the Commissariat Department for transport purposes. The suggestion in paragraph 42 of the report regarding the advisability of purchasing young stock for the Ahmednagar Rearing Depôt at all the Sind shows should be communicated to the Director of Army Remounts for such action as may be deemed necessary. 6. The number (171) of colts castrated by Veterinary Assistants and Salutris during the year exceeded by 62 the number (109) in 1893-94, but as in the previous year the Veterinary Assistants do not seem to have paid sufficient attention to this part of their duty as out of the total number only 19 colts were castrated by them. The Collectors of the districts in which there are Veterinary dispensaries should be requested to draw the attention of the Dispensary Com- mittees to this matter. 7. The total expenditure of the Department rose from Rs. 60,581 in 1893-94 to Rs. 66,857 in 1894-95. The Provincial share of this cost amounted to Rs. 41,352 as compared with Rs. 35,767 in 1893-94, and Rs. 11,573 and Rs. 13,932 were debited to Local Funds and Imperial Revenues respectively. The increase in cost occurs mainly under the heads mentioned below :4 13,936 in the year under report as compared with 9,843 in the previous year, and the percentage of animals cured and relieved rose from 85 to 86. The Collectors of Khándesh and Belgaum should be requested to draw the attention of the Dispensary Committees to the remarks made by the Superintendent regarding the unsuitability of the present sites occupied by the Veterinary dispensaries in those districts. The suggestion of the Survey Commissioner and Director regarding the advisability of adopting where possible the system followed in Shikárpur of alternating the charges of Stationary and Itinerating Veterinary Assistants should be brought to the notice of the various Dispensary Committees. As regards the recommendation that animals which are the subjects of pro- secution for cruelty should be sent to dispensaries for treatment and detention till they are fit for work it is not clear that there is any legal authority for a general order to this effect, but the owners can of course be warned that if the animals are worked before they are fit they will be liable to further prosecu- tion and advised to send them to the dispensary. 10. The attention of the officers concerned should be drawn to para- graph 80 of the report, and they should be requested to see that no delay is allowed to occur in future in the submission of the District returns and Veteri- nary Dispensary reports required for the preparation of the Superintendent's annual report. Government concur in the observation made by the Survey Commissioner and Director in paragraph 18 of his review and trust that in future reports the Superintendent will give fuller explanations of variations in figures. Appendices to future reports should be prepared in the forms sanc- tioned in Government Resolution No. 2997, dated 22nd April last. 11.

The number of stallions present at the close of the year under report is as shown in the table below :[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page]
5 Stallions which produce the most suitable stock for the army. 13. Table V shows that a larger percentage of Norfolk Trotter and Arab stock was drafted to British Regiments than stock got by thorough-breds, and that 80 per cent. of thorough- bred stock was sent to Native Cavalry. This is, I think, due to the number of old thorough-breds that were in this Presidency, as it is a well-known fact that stock got by individual horses after they have arrived at a certain age seldom exceed 14-2 in height. They were, however, very shapely, well-balanced horses, up to weight, but did not come up to the standard height required for British Cavalry. The rejections, six in number, were sold, being under-sized; and it is very gratifying to find that the general public are quite alive to the merits of horses reared in Government paddocks, as the very high average of Rs. 501 obtained at public auction, denotes.

A total number of 312 animals changed hands, which is most satisfactory. 6 Khorásan donkeys were purchased by this Depart- ment for stud purposes, and arrangements have been made to further extend the trade.

The decrease in numbers throughout the various shows held in this Presidency and in Sind is due to the fact that the classification was carried out entirely by me and greater care exercised than in former years, when this duty was performed by local officers and myself.

It is a difficult matter for me to attempt, in a report of this description, any- thing beyond roughly giving the limits of the various tracts of country from which horses suitable for Native Cavalry are to be obtained, and to divide the so- called northern horse into four distinct classes, i.e., Cabulis, Khorásans, Turko- mans, and country-breds:22 this conformation being probably due to bad Turkoman blood. They are quiet, docile horses, easily broken, stand the heat of the plains, and are less liable to skin disease than the Cabuli. I think I may safely say that horses of this stamp carefully selected are next to country-breds and Arabs the best troopers obtainable at Native Cavalry prices. The Native Cavalry Regi- ments in Sind are mounted almost entirely on horses of this class and they speak very highly of them for the particular country in which these regi- ments are stationed. That they are fast enough for Native Cavalry was proved by the late Inspector-General of Cavalry who galloped a squadron belonging to the 5th Bombay Cavalry, composed entirely of these horses, over a measured quarter of a mile in 36 seconds, making a uniform pace of 25 miles an hour. That officer also tested their marching capa- bilities very highly and was more than satisfied with the result. The best of these horses are undoubtedly bought by the regiments in Sind and the Láhore dealers, who supply regiments both in Bengal and Bombay, the Calcutta and Bombay tramway companies. The remainder after attending all the various shows gradually work their way into India, and some few of the best are shipped at Karáchi, and horses that to my certain knowledge could be bought in Sind for Rs. 200 sell in Bombay for Rs. 600 and up- wards. Those not shipped at Karáchi inarch across the desert and are generally to be met with at Ahmedabad, and from there they usually strike across India, and the same dealers and horses that one met in Sind are to be found as low down as Secunderabad, Hyderabad and Madras. It will be seen that they cover a vast tract of country during the season, doing long marches, seldom railing ; yet it is quite the exception to see a horse in poor condition at any stage between Peshin and Madras and under conditions where the food and water are constantly being changed and without shelter. I think that these facts speak for themselves and prove that this particular class of horse can gallop 15 miles an hour and can march under adverse circumstances from one end of India to the other without losing condition. The Manager, Calcutta Tramway, says of these horses " that they are easily kept in condition except during latter part of the hot weather and beginning of the rains ; that they do better and live longer than the Waler." The Manager, Bombay Tramway, says " that in our work and climate it is easier to keep these horses in condition and that they are less liable to sickness, debility and sun-stroke than Australians. " The Manager, Karáchi Tramway Company, says " I know of no specific fault to which, as a class, this horse is subjected. He is particularly free from disease and the mortality is less under conditions of hard work than other class of horse."

Large numbers of mares, many of which have two or three strains of English and Arab blood, are annually brought over the border, covered by Government stallions, and taken back to their villages to foal, and it is hardly necessary for me to point out that these horses cannot be classed as either Cabulis, Khorásans or Turkomans, although many such are annually bought and sold as Northerns. To those accustomed to the various classes of horses to be met along the border, there is little difficulty in distinguishing the country-breds from the foreigner, and every endeavour should be made by purchasing officers to trace the various remounts bought with a view of correctly classifying them in the regimental records. All officers are unanimous in their opinion that the country-bred is par excellence the trooper for Native Cavalry, but they complain that, when mature and fit to enter the ranks, his price is often beyond them, and that 4-year olds are not obtainable in sufficient numbers to supply their annual requirements. Taking these facts into consideration the question now arises as to whether means could not be adopted to rear a certain percentage of the number that are foaled in this country annually. In this Presidency alone, and I have every reason to believe throughout the greater portion of the horse-breeding districts of India, a great number of well-bred young stock are sold by their owners at ages varying from 4 to 7 months. A large percentage of stock sold under these conditions, owing to a variety of causes, never reach maturity and few find their way into the ranks of either British or Native Cavalry. If accurate statistics of the stock sold under these conditions were obtainable, I feel sure that the loss would be found to be very great, and it is with a view of securing this material that I would advocate some system whereby a certain number of young stock could be reared for Native Cavalry. I realize that there are considerable difficulties in the way, but the experi- ment could be tried on a small scale and in a suitable locality without any great expenditure, and if successful, could be carried out to its entirety on such lines that all Native Cavalry Regiments would be mounted on horses which are acknowledged to be the best in India, and each regiment would have a small reserve of the most mature of these horses to fall back upon in the event of war. The present system has had a very long and patient trial and cannot be said to fulfill all requirements, as the large number of Walers and foreign horses in our ranks proves. As we cannot alter the conditions of the country, or improve the position of the majority of men who breed horses, or compel them to keep their stock until mature, it behoves us to find some means of endeavouring to utilize material which at a certain age exists in large numbers in this country, and which, when mature and in a fit state to enter the service, is not forthcoming. The buying of Walers for Native Cavalry seems a somewhat doubtful policy, and I think, if the opinions of all Officers Commanding Native Cavalry Regiments were obtained, that those in favour of the Waler would be in the minority. This is another strong argument in favour of getting more value than we do at present out of the country-bred, and adopting such means that the necessity for going beyond the sea or over our own frontiers for Native Cavalry remounts would be considerably lessened, if not in course of time entirely done away with. GENERAL REMARKS. 82. I would again call attention to the general remarks in my report for 1894-95, and would wish to bring to the notice of Government that the delay in submitting this report is due to the fact that the greatest difficulty is experienced by me in obtaining the necessary returns from district officers although they were particularly asked to submit them by the end of April. The Shikárpur returns were not received until the 9th June and are still incomplete, the result of the coverings of " Royal Visit " not being given. The following dispensary reports were received on the dates mentioned against them :25 83. The new stallion stables have been erected during the year at Ahmed- nagar, and, it is to be hoped, will be fit to occupy before the end of the rains. 84. The scheme for pensioning and training syces has been brought into force, and I trust it will in time have the desired effect of getting a thoroughly reliable body of men in the Department who will understand the management of a stud horse and lead to better results throughout, as I feel sure that the majority of men employed at present as stallion syces know little and care less for the valuable horses entrusted to their charge.

Do. 3rd 47 REVIEW BY THE SURVEY COMMISSIONER AND DIRECTOR, LAND RECORDS AND AGRICULTURE. No. A/2449 OF 1896. Poona, 12th August 1896. Submitted to Government. 2. As directed in para. 10 of Government Resolution No. 118, dated 6th January last, Tables II48 "Young Chieftain" have been placed, as sanctioned by Government, at the dis- posal of the Vánkáner State, though he is still borne on the register. It has now been decided in consultation with the Inspector General that no English stallions less than 4 years old are in future to be imported for Bombay. The Superintendent notices with satisfaction the great improvement effected in the Arab market, the higher price now offered by Government acting as an incentive. Stallions actually at stud work. 6.The effective strength of stallions actually at stud work rose from 83.2 per cent. of the total number in the previous year to 84.1 per cent. in the present year, the rest being in the Ahmadnagar Depot for acclimatization or treat- ment. This shows some improvement though the percentage is still much below that in 1892-93, when it was 95.5. Now that the Presidency is more or less provided with young stallions, it is hoped that considerable improvement will be shown next year. Of the 56.37 stallions actually at stud work, 35 were working in the Deccan, 8.38 in Gujarát and 12.99 in Sind and Cutch. The great difference in Sind between the number actually at stud work and that on the register is mainly due to the fact that the new stallions, which were to replace the old and worn-out ones, removed long ago, were sent to that province almost at the close of the year. The Superintendent branded mares for the first time and has located stallions in Lower Sind, which, he considers, promises to be capable of further extension. Stallions producing the most suitable stock for the Army. It is satisfactory to find that the Norfolk Trotter has regained the first place it had lost last year as the producer of the most suitable stock for the Army; the Arab comes second, and the T. B. E. stands last. The Superintendent attributes the unfavourable result in the case of the last to old age of most of the T. B. E. stallions. Out of 44 remounts inspected, 6 were rejected, but for want of class details they have not been charged against the class to which they belong Mares covered. 7. The number of mares covered by horse and pony stallions rose from 1,869 to 1,894, showing a slight increase of 25 mares. Of these 1,143 belonged to Deccan, 236 to Gujarat, and 515 to Sind and Cutch, against 1,081, 256 and 532 respectively in the pre- vious year. Thus in point of numbers Deccan alone shows some increase. The average coverings per stallion, however, show improvement in Sind and Cutch alone, being 39.64 against 34.83 during last year. In the Deccan the work per head comes to 32.65 and in Gujarát to 28.16 against 33.25 and 32.12, respective- ly of the previous year. The decrease in Gujarát is due to short work done by two Arab ponies who covered only 54 mares against 106 in the previous year. The horse stallions, on the other hand, did there more work than last year. And the Superintendent's general remark regarding demand for stallions that a large trade in milk and milk products has recently sprung up to the detriment of horse-breeding industry, which is true of Kaira District, does not hold for all Gujarát. The Hyderabad Local Board stallion covered 12 mares against 32 in the previous year; but he worked only for six months, having died in October last. He has been replaced by another in March last. It seems doubtful whether the statistics given above include the number covered under the certification system sanctioned by Government in November last. The Superintendent informs the undersigned that the first report on that system is only due in December next. He is apparently under some misappre- hension in supposing that no report is due till then. The report due in Decem- ber is on the working of the system as a whole with a view to decide its conti- nuance or otherwise. Government had, in their Resolution No. 3316, dated 23rd April last, called upon the Superintendent to notice the result of the system in his annual reports, and the Superintendent ought to have given the number of coverings effected during the four months of its working. The Government of India have, in commenting upon the Inspector-General's report for the past year, remarked that some redistribution of stallions in the Bombay Presidency is desirable as they appear to be doing short work, especially those in the Deccan and Gujarát. This point has not been noticed by the Superintendent, but the
49 undersigned is of opinion that no action should be taken in this connection until the result of the working of the certification system is before Government in December next. Produce Statistics. 8.The following table compares the results of coverings of the year under report with those of the previous two years:50 year's working only. Of the 32 coverings made by the District Board stallion at Hyderabad 4 only were successful, 24 did not hold, and the result of 4 is unknown. Remounts purchased. 9. The number of remounts purchased during the year amounted to 521 or 164 less than in the previous year. Less number was purchased for the Native Cavalry and Sind Police. Of the total number, 193 or 37 per cent. were purchased at the principal shows in the Presidency. The places where purchases were made have been shown as required by the Government of India, and these disclose that 28 per cent. of the remounts were bought outside the Presidency. It is satisfactory to note that the Rearing Depôt is securing year by year an increasing number of young stock suitable for remounts. Purchases for it were made for the first time in Sind with successful results. The Superintendent notes with satisfaction the improve- ment found in the Depôt animals. Of the total number purchased, about 28 per cent. were the known produce of Government sires, 49 per cent. were country- bred and the rest of unknown origin. Castration. 10. Castration makes little progress, the number of animals operated upon falling from 171 to 151. Veterinary Assistants cas- trated only 32 animals: 8 in Belgaum and Hyderabad each, 6 in Surat, 3 in Karáchi, 2 in Ahmadabad and the rest elsewhere. The work done is far from satisfactory. Donkey stallions and their work. 11. The number of donkey stallions (26) remained stationary. Four Italian donkeys were imported to replace an equal number removed from the register, one having died, 2 destroyed and one sold. Two stallions were bought for His Highness the Mir of Khairpur and one for a Jamindár in Sind. The total number actually at stud work was 23.03. These covered 872 mares during the year against 763 in the previous year. The average number of coverings per stallion rose from 33.43 to 37.86. This shows some improvement, though the number is still below that of 1893-94, which stood at 41.99. Out of 33.43 coverings per stallion made in 1894-95, only 4.42 foaled, 21.61 having not held, and the result of the rest being unknown. This gives only 13 foals per hundred coverings. The number of coverings in the Deccan and Gujarát shows a steady increase, but the progress made is so slow that the Superintendent despairs of making the industry popular in these tracts. Government have, however, recently expressed their unwillingness to abandon the scheme on such short trial and have directed the Superintendent to watch the progress and notice the results in his annual reports with a view to obtain further experience. The Superintendent notes that the Khorásán donkeys are more popular, much cheaper and apparently surer foal-getters than the Italians, and he has arranged for importing a few of them for stud purposes. The results are apparently based on a single stallion owned by the Department, who covered 33 mares in 1894-95, of which only 7 are known to have turned out successful. The Commissariat Department purchased 27 mules for transport purposes and 13 were bought by Captain Willis for the Army. Branding of mares. 12. During the year the Superintendent branded in all 1,465 mares,51 to divide the net increase between the number of stallions present, whether at the beginning or close of a year, as the average number actually maintained throughout the year differs from either and also varies with each year. An average increase per head can be properly shown thus:52 where no regular Veterinary staff has been entertained by the District Boards, but this could not always be complied with owing to paucity of graduates avail- able for such off and on duties. Cases having again been brought to light in which the Superintendent did not receive reports received by this office, district officers have recently been requested to arrange for their being regularly sent to that officer. Veterinary Dispensaries. 17. There were 12 stationary and 4 itinerating dispensaries at work at the end of the year. One dispensary at Dhárwár was newly opened and that at Poona, which existed before as a College of Science institution, was handed over to the Dispensary Committee and brought under the general scheme. The itinerating dispensary at Belgaum was temporarily closed for want of a suitable graduate to take charge of the work. The total number of animals treated at the various dispensaries rose from 13,936 in the previous year to 17,554 during the year under report. Of these, 75.4 per cent. were cured, 7.5 per cent. relieved, 3.2 per cent. died, 1.3 per cent. returned incurable, in 10.9 per cent. cases results were unknown and the rest were under treatment at the end of the year. The percent- age of unknown results is large, but, as explained by the Superintendent, it is probably due to owners removing their animals before they are cured or relieved. The work of all the Veterinary graduates except the two working in Shikárpur is reported to be good, the Superintendent especially commending the work of the Assistants in charge of the Karáchi, Ahmadabad, Hyderabad, Násik and Surat dispensaries. Suitable buildings have been provided for or are in course of erection at six places, and it is hoped that the District Boards else- where will before long take steps to remove their want. Instances have been brought to notice in which timely intimation of outbreaks of diseases was not given to the graduates working in the district, and the consequence was that they could not render the necessary assistance in their suppression. Steps are being taken to remedy this defect and it is hoped that in future the services of the graduates will be more fully availed of. In places Veterinary graduates in charge of dispensaries could not attend outbreaks of diseases in the district without closing their charge. This causes serious inconvenience and the District Boards will, it is hoped, entertain itinerating assistants wherever funds permit. Northern Horse. 18. The Superintendent's remarks regarding the Northern Horse are both interesting and instructive, and they may be com- mended for the consideration of the officers concerned. The Government of India have apparently acquiesced in the decision of the Bombay Government to allow dealers to compete at Sind shows. 19.The undersigned is again constrained to observe that the Superintend- ent's remarks are too brief to explain variations of figures and show little improvement over last year's report in this respect.

Annual Administration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department in the Bom- bay Presidency for 1895-96. No. 9927. REVENUE DEPARTMENT. Bombay Castle, 7th December 1896. Letter from the Survey Commissioner and Director of Land Records and Agriculture, No. A(2) these statistics to be reliable, and the Survey Commissioner and Director of Land Records and Agriculture should be requested to expedite the submission of the proposals called for in paragraph 5 of Government Resolution No. 4343, dated 17th May 1894, for placing the registration of mares and their produce on a more satisfactory footing. 3. The number of donkey stallions on the roll at the commencement of the year was 26. During the present year one donkey stallion died, two were destroy- ed and one was sold as it was impotent, while four were imported from other coun- tries. The number of pony mares covered by donkey stallions increased from 763 in 1894-95 to 872 in 1895-96, and the average number of mares covered per stallion rose from 33.43 to 37.86. The decrease in the number of foals from 110 in the previous year to 101 in the year under report is not however satisfactory. As the result of 687 coverings in Sind and Cutch in 1894-95, only 89 foals were reported, the number of cases "not held" being as many as 445, and those "not known" 153. It is however stated that these results cannot be accepted as accurate and that steps are being taken to secure more correct information. Gov- ernment cannot but accept Veterinary Captain Morgan's conclusion that at- tempts to establish mule-breeding in the Deccan and Gujarát are not likely to meet with success, but the experiment may be tried for another year. 4. The numbers of mares for horse, pony and mule-breeding on the regis- ter on 31st March 1895 were 4,731, 5,574 and 1,321 respectively. It is satis- factory to note that during the year under report the Superintendent branded 1,465 mares (915 for horse and pony-breeding and 550 for mule-breeding) against 433 in the previous year, as many as 84 per cent. of them having been branded in Lower Sind. 253 mares were removed from the register during the year owing to death or other causes, and the number on the roll on 3lst March 1896 stood at 12,838 (10,967 for horse and pony-breeding and 1,871 for mule-breeding). The system under which selected Government officers certify mares as fit for service by Government stallions was in force during the last four months of the year, and the Superintendent should have noticed the results of that system in the present report as directed in paragraph 3 of Government Resolution No. 3316, dated 23rd April 1896. 5. The number of country-bred remounts purchased for Government fell from 685 in 1894-95 to 521 in the year under report. This decrease is due to a smaller number having been purchased for the Bombay Native Cavalry and the Police in Sind. Of the animals purchased 144 were reported to be the produce of Government stallions against 117 in the previous year. It is observed that during the year under report purchases for the Ahmednagar Remount Rearing Depôt were made for the first time in Sind with successful results. The high average price obtained for the produce of Government stallions reared in Gov- ernment paddocks but rejected for the cavalry affords the best proof that great improvement in the breed is being effected. 6. The number of colts castrated by Veterinary assistants and salutris together in 1895-96 was 151 as compared with 171 in 1894-95. During the year under report 32 colts were castrated by Veterinary assistants against 19 in the previous year. The number is still much smaller than it should be, and the Collectors concerned should be requested to draw the attention of the Dis- pensary Committees to this matter. 7. The total expenditure of the Department during the year under review (Rs. 69,074-15-10) shows an increase of Rs. 2,218-1-11 over that of the previous year, but this increase is due to the debit to the Civil Veterinary Department of the salary of Veterinary Lieut. Larnder for the period he acted as Superintendent during the absence of Veterinary Captain Morgan on privilege leave. Of the total cost Rs. 40,799 were charged to Provincial Revenues, Rs. 16,748 to Im- perial and Rs. 11,527 to Local Funds, as compared with Rs. 41,352, Rs. 13,932 and Rs. 11,573, respectively, in 1894-95. The average cost of maintenance of each horse and pony stallion rose from Rs. 361-15-7 to Rs. 368-12-6, and that of each donkey stallion from Rs. 286-9-10 to Rs. 292-5-3. On this point the Superintendent's attention should be drawn to the remarks made by the Survey Commissioner and Director of Land Records and Agriculture in para- graph 13 of his memorandum No. A(3) 8. During the year under report outbreaks of cattle-disease were reported from 15 districts of the Presidency, but, as remarked by Veterinary Captain Morgan and Colonel Godfrey, other districts could not have been entirely free from it. The total number of animals attacked by various contagious and infectious diseases rose from 17,273 in 1894-95 to 18,635 in 1895-96, but the percentage of fatal cases decreased from 58 to 53.65. As many as 91.3 per cent. of the ani- mals attacked suffered from rinderpest, and 92 per cent. of the total number of deaths were due to that disease. The usual precautionary measures to prevent the spread of the diseases were adopted by Veterinary assistants in those districts in which they are employed. 9. The Veterinary Dispensaries in the province of Sind and in the districts of Ahmedabad, Kaira, Násik and Khándesh were inspected by the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, during the year under report. The Surat Veteri- nary Dispensary which was established in October 1894 was not however inspect- ed by him either in 1894-95 or 1895-96. Veterinary Captain Morgan reports fa- vourably on the work done by Veterinary assistants in charge of dispensaries and itinerating veterinary assistants except those employed in the Shikárpur District. The total number of animals treated during 1895-96 was 17,554 against 14,315 in the previous year. The proportion of those cured and relieved fell from 86 per cent. to 82.93 per cent., but this decline is attributed to the fact that owners remove their cattle before they are either cured or relieved, and the result has to be shown as "unknown." The Collectors of Khándesh, Belgaum, Dhárwár, Surat and Shikárpur should be requested to communicate to the re- spective Dispensary Committees the remarks made by Veterinary Captain Morgan as to the necessity of providing suitable buildings for the veterinary dispensaries in those districts. 10. The attention of the officers concerned should be drawn to paragraph 82 of the report, and they should be requested to see that the district returns and Veterinary Dispensary reports required for the preparation of the Superintendent's annual report are punctually submitted to him. Government concur in the remark contained in paragraph 19 of the Survey Commissioner's review, and, as directed in paragraph 10 of Government Resolution No. 118, dated 6th January 1896, the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, should give fuller ex- planations of variations of figures in future reports. 11. The remarks made by Veterinary Captain Morgan regarding what are called "Northern horses" have been read by Government with interest. Subject to the remarks made above the report is satisfactory and shows that Veterinary Captain Morgan continues to discharge his varied duties with zeal. G. S. CURTIS, Under Secretary to Government.

5 Stallions which produce the most suitable stock for the army. 12. Table V shows that out of 73 head of stock inspected by me and issued from this depôt, 28 were issued to British Cavalry, 39 to Native Cavalry, and 11 rejected. 40 per cent. of stock got by thorough-breds, 41 per cent. by Norfolk Trotters and 16 per cent. by Arabs were issued to British Cavalry; 70 per cent. of stock got by Arabs, 45 per cent. by thorough-breds and 50 per cent. by Norfolk Trotters were issued to Native Cavalry. This table proves to a great extent that the first cross of the Arab on the Deccan mare is seldom big enough for British Cavalry, although they make undeniable Native Cavalry troopers, as they are powerful, well-balanced horses with good bone and substance. The rejections, 11 in number, were sold by public auction and realized the very high average of Rs. 562, an increase of Rs. 61 over last year. This again proves the great value set by the public on stock got by Government horses and reared in Government paddocks. (2).6 15. The number of remounts purchased at various places is given below:7 Number at stud work. 20. The number of donkey stallions actually at stud work during the year was 25.40 against 23.03 last year. Number of mares covered. 21. The number of pony mares covered during the year is given below and compared with figures for the two preceding years:8 26. It will be seen that the increase is general except at Deesa and Hyderabad in the case of horse and at Bijápur and Ahmedabad in the case of pony. The figure for Hyderabad appears to be incorrect, and the point has been referred back to the Collector. At Bijápur the stallion was only for two months. The decrease in other places is very small, and no explanation is available. (2).9 31. It has been deemed advisable to go carefully through the registers and strike off all mares over 20 years of age, as I am of opinion that few mares in this coountry are worth breeding from after they have attained this limit. By adopting this method, and taking a rough census once every five years, a more or less accurate record of the breeding mares in this Presidency will be obtain- able. Number present at close of year. 32. The balance remaining on the 31st March 1897 is shown in the table below:10 Class of Stallion. Average number of Mares covered per Stallion.

The Arab horse has shown some improvement in the number of mares covered, but the results of the coverings, as far as we have been able to ascertain, are not satisfactory. (4)11 stallion has fallen from 37.86 to 29.64. This fall is mostly in Sind and specially in the case of Persian donkeys. I cannot account for the falling off in the total number of coverings, and District Officers are unable to give any reason. (3).12 91 mules were exhibited, out of which 25 were bought for Government pur- poses. Some of the best, I regret to say, were bought by Punjábi dealers, and it is extremely doubtful if they will eventually find their way into Government service. The Remount Agent purchased 3 head of young stock and was unable to obtain more on account of the high prices asked by breeders. The total num- ber of horse stock sold amounted to 129, of which 98 were for Government and the remainder, private individuals. General Remarks.13 Summary. 50. In spite of the great scarcity which prevailed in certain parts of the Presidency, and that the same careful system of classi- fication was again carried out this year, there is an increase in the total number of animals shown, viz., 4,186 against 3,993 last year. The falling off in numbers in the Deccan was compensated by an increase in Sind. The total expenses incurred on account of these shows amounted to Rs. 19,352-14-4, of which Rs. 14,327-15-3 were actually awarded as prizes and Rs. 5,024-15-1 were spent on fodder and the general arrangements of the shows. Government contributed Rs. 6,000 against Rs. 5,000 last year. Stallions whose produce won prizes. 51. Table XVI gives the number and class of stallions whose produce won prizes at several horse shows held in this Presidency during 1896-97. It will be seen that the produce of 60 sires won 151 prizes, 22 each of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd classes and 85 of the other classes. The produce of thorough-bred English comes first, Norfolk Trotter second and Arab third in point of merit, the average number of prizes won by the produce per stallion in each class being 5.69, 1.75 and 1.52 respectively. 52.

15 Cattle Fairs and Shows. Ahmednagar. 61. Commenced on 12th November 1896 and held in conjunction with the horse show. The total number of animals exhibited amounted to 173 against 218 last year. The classes throughout the show were only fair, and it is evident that, in spite of increasing the prizes, little or no interest is taken in this part of the show, and only animals within a radius of a few miles of Ahmednagar are exhibited. It has been deter- mined to do away with the cattle show in future. Moro. 62. Commenced on the. 1st February 1897 and held in conjunction with the horse show. The total number of animals exhi- bited amounted to 166 against 147 last year. The bullocks and oxen were fair, milch cattle and buffaloes good. The Committee are of opinion that the majority of the cattle exhibited are inferior to those usually met with in the district, and that they are exhibited in a purely hap- hazard fashion and simply because they happen to be on the spot. Under these circumstances they are of opinion that the cattle show should in future be abandoned. Talhár. 63. No cattle show held. Bhuj. 64. Commenced on the 15th February 1897 and held in conjunction with the horse show. The total number of animals exhibited amounted to 319 against 185 last year. The animals throughout were very moderate and shown in poor condition. As the show is not a Government one it is difficult to re-arrange this part of the prospectus. Chinchli. 65.

Veterinary Captain Morgan was in charge of the Department throughout the year. The actual distance covered by him in the course of his tour is not so great as in some previous years. This is partly due to the quarantine, which delayed the Superintendent a fortnight in Sind. But the fact is, the thoroughness of a tour cannot be gauged by its mileage. The Superintendent saw nearly all parts of his charge and did a good year's work, with plenty of travelling. He visited the marginally noted districts and States, and Bombay four times. He inspected eight* out of twelve veterinary dispensaries and attended all the shows including that at Bhúj. He visited the State paddocks in Káthiáwár along with the Remount Agent and assisted him in making purchases of young stock for the Rearing Depôt. He purchased remounts for the Thar and Párkar Police and one stallion each for the Dhrángadra and Rájkot States. Horse and pony stallions on the register. 3. There were 69 horse and pony stallions on the register at the commence- ment of the year. Of these eight were removed from the register for various causes, five were added44 other hand, to try and breed remounts from thorough-breds or Arabs only, I do not think would be a success. We want a certain proportion of hackneys to keep up the class of mares, and then with thorough-breds like 'Vendor,' St. Porcaire,' 'François' and 'Harvester' the produce ought to be capable of carrying a British soldier." The conclusions of the Inspector-General, Civil Veterinary Department, are as follows:45 Produce statistics. 8. The remarks of the Superintendent on the important subject of the registration of produce are somewhat brief. The results recorded are compared for the different divi- sions of the Presidency in the following table:46 return which he hopes will secure an improvement. Some such system could possibly be introduced here. Inquiries are being made and a final report on the subject will be submitted to Government, if not simultaneously with, yet very shortly after, this review. Suitability of stallions to produce remounts for British Cavalry. 11. The appended table gives a much better idea than the statistics of any one year of the result achieved by the differ- rent classes of stallions in producing stock suitable for remount purposes, after rearing in a nursery depôt:47 a system is, however, very questionable, and it has frequently been debated before. But I have invited the Superintendent to make suggestions on the sub- ject. One difficulty, which is certain to be encountered, may be mentioned here. It is hard to trace much of the produce of Government sires as it is. The maintenance of a lien on it, whereby the owner would get a smaller price than he now obtains in the open market, would make the ascertainment harder still. My personal view is that, if Government wishes to get more of the produce, they will have to buy it younger. The risks of satisfactory choice and ill-success in rearing are greater. But I venture to believe that the results with thoroughly expert selecting agency would be more satisfactory than they are at present. Castration. 13. The number of animals castrated during the year was 148 against 151 during the previous year and 171 during 1894-95. Of these 41 were castrated by Veterinary Assistants against 32 during the preceding year. The work done by these Assistants is still small, and the attention of the Collectors should be again drawn to the subject. On this point the following explanatory remarks recently received from the Superintendent are of interest:48 mule breeding should not be given up in this Presidency and the whole of the Superintendent's energy be concentrated on branding for horse and pony breeding. As Government have already been informed, I concur with the Superin- tendent in thinking further efforts at mule breeding useless, either in the Deccan or Gujarát. The prejudice against it is inveterate. Instead, greater encourage- ment might perhaps be given to pony breeding. Branding of mares. 15. The Superintendent branded only 525 mares against 1,465 during the preceding year. This falling off is much to be regret- ted, but was under the circumstances absolutely un- avoidable. The only part of the country, where even in ordinary years there is any chance of large numbers being branded, is Sind, where the Superintendent's tour was stopped. He toured in the Deccan districts for 60 days and no doubt would have secured better results in a year of plenty. Even as it is, the total of 236 branded for horse breeding only is not very far behind the amount, which in the case of the North-Western Provinces in 1895-96 was found satisfactory by the Inspector-General, Civil Veterinary Department. The grand total of 525, which includes mares branded for pony and mule breeding, is considerably ahead of it. At the same time I have requested the Superintendent to concentrate his energies particularly on the Deccan during the coming season. But it has always to be remembered that in contrast to the people of Sind and Northern India, with whom the brand is highly popular as a frank of superior quality and soundness, the people of the Bombay Presidency are indifferent to, if they do not actually dislike, the brand. This prejudice no one has yet suc- ceeded in overcoming. If any one is likely to do so, it will be the present Superintendent, who has plenty of persuasive power and the will to exercise it. The removal from the register of mares over twenty years of age, which was carried out during the year by the Superintendent, is a sound and reason- able measure. The total number of branded mares standing on the register at the end of the year was 10,510. The following explanation received from the Superintendent since writing the above will show how real the difficulties are he has to contend with in the Deccan and the extent to which conditions there differ from those of Northern India:49 "Prior to visiting a district a copy of my tour is sent to the Collector giving the dates on which it is proposed to visit a certain village. He is asked to warn all the village authorities to collect mares and give me all the assistance in their power. The Mámlatdárs with a few exceptions (which I have reported) have always attended during the time the mares are being branded, as I make it a rule to ask breeders if they have any complaints to make about the stallions, whether they have any difficulty in getting their mares covered, and generally explaining the system on which Government are endeavouring to work, and the system adopted for the purchase of young stock for the Remount Rearing Depôt. On these occasions I find the presence of the Mámlatdár most useful, as in addition to making him conversant with the system, he is then in a position to explain it hereafter to any breeders who may not be present. I also find that these small village gatherings are most useful in many ways, as they tend to bring one in touch with what is actually taking place in the neighbourhood, and much useful information is obtained which could not be got through any other source. I do not see that any improvement under this particular head could be made on the present system." Cost of feed and keep of stallions, 16. The following table shows that there is a general increase in the cost of feed of all the stallions during the year under report as compared with the previous year:50 horse-breeding operations in their territories, and stallions were stationed there in the hope that Government would obtain the produce as remounts. Owing to various causes, which need not be entered into, these expectations were disappointed. The Chiefs were not on good terms with the then Superintendent of the Horse-breeding Department and took little or no effective interest in breeding operations conducted under his supervision or advice. It became finally necessary to remove the stallions. * * * * "6. But things are now entirely changed. The Chiefs are allowed to conduct their breeding operations in their own way and with their sires of their own choosing. The Superintendent of the Civil Veterinary Depart- ment, however, without being given any official locus standi with them, has contrived, with what can hardly be termed anything less than admir- able tact, so to win their confidence that they have introduced into their studs several stallions of his choosing, and have sold to him animals fit for remount purposes. They also allow their mares to be mated according to his ideas. "7. There are, in the paddocks at Ahmadnagar at the present moment more than twenty young stock thus obtained, which I have seen, and which it would be hard to beat. Indeed it may safely be affirmed that since 1893, no Native States in India of similar extent and importance have supplied Government with such high class stock, whether in size or quality, or in such large numbers as the States of Káthiáwár and Cutch. The following are the results since 1894, in which year the present Superintendent com- menced going into Cutch and Káthiáwár:51 two years. As Veterinary Captain Morgan states, it is unlikely that these dis- tricts were as free from disease as the absence of reports would imply. Indeed the dispensary reports each year show that in some districts, from which it is not reported, disease did occur, and I have ventured to call the attention of the Collectors to the subject. While this state of things exists, I am unable to feel very sanguine as to the value of the statistics. They will, however, no doubt improve as time goes on. It is of considerable importance that in districts where Veterinary Graduates are entertained, the arrangements for giving them early information of outbreaks should be more efficient than at present. Instances occur of Graduates arriving in affected localities after the cessation of the epide- mic. Another point in which improvement has been found necessary, is the mode in which the Graduates report the way in which they dealt with the out- break. A special form of report, approved by the Superintendent, Civil Veteri- nary Department, has been drawn up in this office and circulated for general adoption. Year. Attacks. Deaths. 1894-95 ... 7,070 4,173 1895-96 ... 2,053 1,431 1896-97 ... 1,752 1,097 The figures reported in the year under report show that there were 18,513 attacks of epizootic disease, of which 8,810 or 47 per cent. proved fatal. Nearly the whole of the disease was rinderpest. The districts, that suffered most, were Ratnágiri, Upper Sind Frontier, and Kánara. As will be seen from the marginally noted figures, Kánara annually suffers heavily. It has, therefore, been suggested to the Collector that the District Local Board should entertain a Veterinary Graduate for at least a couple of years to visit promptly the scenes of epidemic disease and aid in its suppression and prevention. A similar measure has already been taken by the District Local Board of Ratnágiri. Veterinary Dispensaries. 22. There were twelve stationary and four itinerating dispensaries at the end of the year. The figures given below show a steady and satisfactory increase both in the number of patients treated and the percentage of cures:52 The permanent buildings erected for the Násik and Ahmadabad Dispen- saries have been occupied, a building for the Dhulia Dispensary is under con- struction, and one for the Surat Dispensary will shortly be undertaken. For want of funds, buildings for the Belgaum, Hyderabad and Shikárpur Dispensaries have had to be postponed. The District Local Board, Broach, wanted to start a dispensary, but Govern- ment grant-in-aid, asked for, has been deferred for the present owing to financial pressure. The District Local Boards of Poona and Surat are considering the appointment of an Itinerating Assistant, and the Sholápur Dispensary, sanctioned long ago, has not been opened for want of a suitable building. Government will be glad to acknowledge the liberality of Sir Dinshaw Maneckji Petit in pre- senting a further contribution of Rs. 5,000 for the fitting out of the Násik Dispensary. Miscellaneous. 23. The Superintendent's proposal that district officers should forward their returns by 15th April, so as to enable him to submit his report by 1st June, should, it is submitted, be approved. Conclusion. 24. The somewhat critical passages with respect to horse and mule-breeding operations in Bombay, which occur in the last pub- lished report of the Inspector-General of the Civil Veterinary Department, had attracted my notice, and I have, therefore, been at particular pains in drawing up this review to examine Captain Morgan's work, so far as the results can be ascertained from reported facts and figures. I have seen a good deal of Captain Morgan himself, and when I visited Nagar last November saw the stallions at the Depôt and the remount young stock. Veterinary Captain Morgan is an active and energetic officer out of doors, a hard traveller, a skilful organiser, classer and judge at shows, and highly expert as a purchaser of stallions and young stock. He gets good work from his sub- ordinates and maintains the most excellent relations with district officers and unusually thorough touch with the officers of the Remount Department. His year's work is, on the whole, always full and good, and the results and progress, which he shows, are, I respectfully maintain, entirely creditable in the circum- stances with which he has to deal.

No. 268-L. OF 1897. Bombay Veterinary College, Parel, 29th May 1897. FROM THE PRINCIPAL, BOMBAY VETERINARY COLLEGE; To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. SIR, In compliance with paragraph 2 of Government Resolution, Revenue Department, No. 6773, dated 28th August 1896, I have the honour to submit the following report of the Department entertained in connection with Act XX of 1879, Glanders and Farcy. The last report dealt with a period of twelve months only. The present, therefore, is a report embracing the work of the Department for 15 months, viz., from 1st January 1896 to 31st March 1897. 2. Government in their Resolution No. 10239, Revenue Department, dated 15th December 1896, have transferred the control of the Department from the Commissioner of Police to the Principal, Bombay Veterinary College. 3. Government in their Resolution No. 4645, Judicial Department, dated 4th July 1896, withdrew the assistance which had hitherto been afforded by the Police Inspectors of the City, and were pleased to sanction a special body of Police for the duties connected with the Glanders Act and to be under the sole control of the Department. This body consists of 2 Havildárs, 3 Náiks, and 2 sepoys. To distinguish these men from the ordinary Police of the City, each man wears a chevron on the right arm with the letters "V. P." sewed thereon. The staff of Inspectors have been posted as follows:2 2. The Assistant Principal, Bombay Veterinary College (ex officio). 3. H. Rogers, Esq., M.R.C.V.S., of the firm of Messrs. R. Scott and Co. 4. F. Stephens, Esq., M.R.C.V.S., of the firm of Messrs. Stephens and Sons. 5. Ainsworth Wilson, Esq., M.R.C.V.S., of the firm of Messrs. R. Scott and Co. The Principal and Assistant Principal, Bombay Veterinary College, are, in addition, appointed Veterinary Surgeons, under the Act, for the town of Bándra in Thána, and Násik. 5. The number of glandered horses destroyed during the fifteen months under report was 36 as against 26 for the 12 months ending 31st December 1895, which is a slight increase. This I attribute to the very careful supervision exercised by the Department as now constituted and also to Bándra being placed under one of the Divisional Veterinary Inspectors. Forty horses were admitted to the Lazaretto, 25 were glandered and 15 suspicious cases. 10 of the latter developed glanders, 3 died from debility and 2 were discharged. Out of these 40 horses, 12 belonged to the owners of carriages plying for hire, 10 came from the Commission stables, 9 were the property of private individuals, 7 were found wandering about the streets ownerless, and 2 came from the Harbour Division. The breeds were as follows:3 APPENDIX. Financial statement of the Lazaretto Establishment in connection with Act XX of 1879 for the official year ending 31st March 1897. Budget sanction. Amount.

No. 8560. REVENUE DEPARTMENT. Bombay Castle, 24th November 1897. Letter from the Principal, Bombay Veterinary College, No. 268-l., dated 29th May 18972 1896-97 was 59.52 against 56.37 in the previous year, the remainder having been kept at Ahmednagar for acclimatisation or treatment. Five hundred and ninety- seven foals were reported to have been produced from coverings by Government horses in 1895-96 against 615 in 1894-95, the number of mares covered being 1,894 and 1,669 respectively. The average known produce per stallion also fell from 11.03 in the previous year to 10.59 in the year under review. The decrease in the average number of mares covered per stallion from 33.59 in 1895-96 to 32.24 in 1896-97 is attributed by Veterinary Captain Morgan to the scarcity of forage, but as observed by Mr. Muir-Mackenzie it appears to be mainly due to the backwardness of the people of Lower Sind in utilizing the services of the stallions. The system is new to this part of the Province and it is hoped that it will gradually become popular, especially since arrangements have been made by the Superintendent to station stallions at the houses of the most influential zamindárs. The statistics of produce are again reported to be untrustworthy, notably in Sind, where the proportion of 'results unknown' is very high. The proposals called for in paragraph 5 of Government Resolution No. 4343, dated 17th May 1894, for the improvement of the system of registration of mares and their produce have not yet been received, and the Survey Commissioner and Director should be requested to submit them as early as possible. 3. The number of donkey stallions borne on the register at the commence- ment of the year under report was 26. In 1896-97 one of the stallions died and one was destroyed, while four were imported. The average number of stallions employed on stud work rose from 23.03 in 1895-96 to 25.40 in 1896-97. The number of pony mares covered by donkey stallions fell from 872 in 1895-96 to 753 in 1896 97 and there was also a decrease in the average number of mares covered per stallion from 37.86 to 29.64. The number of mules foaled however rose from 101 in the previous year to 127 in the year under report. As the result of 786 coverings in Sind and Cutch in 1895-96, only 106 foals were reported, the number of cases 'not held' being as many as 451 and those 'not known' 229. These results are stated to be due to inaccuracy of registration, which would thus seem to be growing greater. In places where the statistics are considered to be correct, the results are not unsatisfactory. Before passing final orders on the question whether mule-breeding in the Deccan and Gujarát should not be given up, Government will await the separate report on the subject called for in paragraph 3 of Government Resolution No. 5780, dated 2nd August 1897. 4. The number of mares branded for horse, pony and mule-breeding borne on the register at the commencement of the year were 5278, 5,689 and 1,871 respectively. The decline in the number (525) of mares branded by the Superintendent in 1896-97 as compared with 1,465 in 1895-96 is reported to be due to the scarcity of fodder, which prevented owners from bringing their mares to the Superintendent's camp, and to quarantine at Karáchi, which inter- fered with his tour in Sind. Of the 525 mares branded 486 were for horse and pony-breeding and only 39 for mule-breeding. Forty-four mares on the register died during the year, 27 went out of the limits of the Presidency and as many as 2,782 were struck off the rolls as being too old for breeding. The total number of mares on the register at the close of the year under report, viz., 10,510 (of which 8,851 were for horse and pony-breeding and 1,659 for mule- breeding) was therefore less than the number at its commencement by 2,328. Government concur with the Survey Commissioner and Director in considering that the removal from the registers of mares over 20 years of age is a sound measure and trust that the adoption of this method combined with a five-yearly census will result in a more accurate record of the brood mares in the Presidency. 5. The system under which selected Government officers were authorised to certify mares as fit for service by Government stallions has been in force for 16 months, but only one officer (Mr. Bagnell) exercised the powers conferred. The system can therefore hardly be said to have had a trial. The attention of the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, should be drawn to the sugges- tions made by Mr. Muir-Mackenzie in paragraph 7 of his review and he should be requested to submit definite proposals on the subject.
3 6. The number of country-bred remounts purchased for Government fell from 521 in the previous year to 304 in the year under report. The decrease is mainly due to the purchase of fewer animals for the Bombay Native Cavalry, Of the animals bought only 91 were reported to be the produce of Government stallions against 144 in the year 1895-96. Only 27 remounts were bought for the Ahmednagar Remount-rearing Depôt and Veterinary Captain Morgan points out the steady increase of price that has taken place for stock got by Government sires and suggests that a lien should be maintained by Government on such stock. The report called for from the Superintendent by the Survey Commissioner and Director on this point will be awaited. 7. One hundred and forty-eight colts were castrated by Veterinary Assistants and Salutris during the year under report against 151 in 1895-96. During the year 1896-97 Veterinary Assistants castrated only 41 animals. This number is still very small and as suggested by the Survey Commissioner and Director in paragraph 13 of his review the attention of the Collectors should again be drawn to the subject. 8. The total expenditure of the Department during the year under review was Rs 68,733-4-1 against Rs. 69,074-15-10 for 1895-96. Of the total cost Rs. 41,798 were charged to Provincial Revenues, Rs. 13,859 to Imperial Funds and Rs. 13,076 to Local Funds, as compared with Rs. 40,799, Rs. 16,748 and Rs. 11,527 respectively in 1895-96. The average cost of maintenance of each horse and pony stallion rose from Rs. 368 in 1895-96 to Rs. 425 in the year under report, and that of each donkey stallion from Rs. 292 to Rs. 326. This increase is reported to be due to scarcity and dearness of forage. The Superin- tendent should notice in his next report any economy in the feed and keep of stallions at the depôt which may result from the arrangements to raise fodder at Ahmednagar which were sanctioned in Government Resolution, Financial Department, No. 2338, dated 28th May 1897. 9. Fuller details on the important subject of cattle-breeding might have been given in the Report. As suggested by the Survey Commissioner and Director, steps should be taken to procure complete information of the results of the service of stud bulls maintained by Local Boards. During 1896-97 out- breaks of cattle disease were reported from 17 districts of the Presidency, but no reports on the subject have been received from the districts of the Panch Maháls, Dhárwár, Hyderabad and Thar and Párkar for the last four years and from Surat for the last two years. As remarked by the Superintendent and the Survey Commissioner and Director it is unlikely that these districts were free from disease and the attention of the Collectors should be drawn to this point. It appears that in several cases Veterinary graduates received information of outbreaks of cattle disease too late to enable them to arrive in time to do much good, and arrangements should therefore be made to communicate the informa- tion to the officers concerned more promptly in future. The total number of animals reported to have been attacked by various contagious and infectious diseases during the year under report was 18,513 against 18,635 in 1895-96 and the percentage of fatal cases also fell from 53.65 to 47.58. Rinderpest accounted for 16,862 or 91 per cent . of the total number of the attacks reported and 8,552 or 97 per cent. of the total number of fatal cases. As usual Káuara suffered very heavily from the disease and the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, should be requested to notice in his next report the result of the measures suggested by the Survey Commissioner and Director in paragraph 21 of his review for its suppression and prevention in that district. 10. During the year under review the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, inspected 8 out of the 12 Veterinary dispensaries and found the work of the Veterinary Assistants and dispensaries generally satis- tactory. The results of the enquiry made by the Survey Commissioner and Director of Land Records and Agriculture regarding the cause of the smallness of the number of outpatients at the Poona Veterinary Dispensary should be reported to Government. A separate report should also be submitted to Gov- ernment on the subject of the contribution by the Poona and Kirkee Canton- ment Committee towards the cost of the dispensary. The total number of animals, treated at the several- Veterinary dispensaries rose from 17,554 in
4 1895-96 to 19,614 in 1896-97 and the percentage of those cured and relieved also increased from 82.93 to 84.30. It is again reported that owners remove their animals before they are either cured or relieved and that such cases swell the number under the head ' result unknown.' 10. The attention of the district officers referred to should be drawn to the remarks made by Veterinary Captain Morgan in paragraph 84 of his report and they should be requested to observe greater punctuality in the submission of their returns for embodiment in the Annual Report. The proposal made by the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, and supported by the Survey Commissioner and Director, that district officers should furnish their returns by 15th April, is approved and sanctioned. 11. The Report has been fully reviewed by Mr. Muir-Mackenzie and discloses on the whole continued good work on the part of Veterinary Captain Morgan, which however was curtailed by causes above specified. 12. In accordance with the orders contained in paragraph 2 of Government Resolution No. 6773, dated 28th August 1896, the Principal, Bombay Veterinary College, has submitted his report on the working of the Glanders and Farcy Act in Bombay for consideration with the Report of the Civil Veterinary De- partment. The Report covers a period of 15 months ending 31st March 1897. During this period 36 glandered horses were destroyed against 26 in the 12 months ending 31st December 1895. The slight increase is attributed by Veterinary Major Mills to more careful supervision exercised by the increased establishment of Inspectors and to the fact that Bándra has been placed under one of them. Efforts should be made by the establishment working the Act to check the reprehensible practice of turning glandered horses loose in the streets. The attention of the Municipal Commissioner for the City of Bombay should be drawn to the remarks made in paragraph 6 of Veterinary Major Mills's report regarding the insanitary condition of the stables of the Arab horse-dealers. The question of the supply of uniforms to Inspectors working the Act has been disposed of by Government Resolution No. 5175, dated 10th July 1897. J. P. ORR, Acting Under Secretary to Government.

ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT FOR THE OFFICIAL YEAR 1897-98. PART I.4 completed, and the newly imported Thorough-bred English " Oakwood Towers " was transferred to Beluchistán under instructions from the Inspector-General, Civil Veterinary Department. One Arab pony and one country-bred horse, being old and uncertain foal getters, were sold. The celebrated Thorough-bred English " Tam O'Shanter " was destroyed on the 13th January 1898, as it was deemed inadvisable to keep him alive any longer. He was received in October 1878 as a 7-year old and stood in the Deccan until the time of his death. I believe him to have been the best and most certain foal getter ever imported into this country, and many years must elapse before the mark he has made in the Deccan will die out, and it is highly improbable that the Bombay Govern- ment will ever own such a valuable servant or sterling good horse again. Judg- ing from after events, I feel sure that had he remained in England his stud career would have been an unparalleled success. Two Arab horses and one Arab pony also were destroyed, all being incapacitated by age for stud purposes. The general percentage of casualties was 6.38 for horse and 5.26 for pony against 6.25 and 9.52 respectively last year. No horse or pony stallion died during the year.

5 prised to find that the figures work out as well as they do under the circum- stances. All the early part of the year the mares and young stock were starved, and in several villages which I visited, I found the young stock totally blind. The latter part of the year the horses were practically closed to all outsiders owing to the strict quarantine regulations in force. Considerable improvement, however, has taken place lately, and mares are coming in pretty regularly to the Depôt horses. Horse-breeding has remained more or less stationary in Gujarát and Sind, although similar complaints as to plague quarantine regulations were received from both these provinces. Stallions which produce the most suitable stock for the Army. 10. Table V shows that out of 47 head of stock inspected by me, and issued from the Ahmednagar Depôt, 18 were issued to British Cavalry, 19 to Native Cavalry, 2 selected as chargers' 1 to Royal Artillery and 7 rejected. 64 per cent. got by thorough-breds, 50 per cent. by Norfolk Trotters, 9 per cent. by Arabs, 45 per cent. unknown, and 16 per cent. by Australian thorough-breds were issued to British Cavalry. 14 per cent. by thorough-breds, 25 per cent. by Nor- folk Trotters, 72 per cent. by Arabs, 27 per cent. unknown, 100 per cent. by country breds, and 66 per cent. by Australian thorough-breds to Native Cavalry. Of the rejections 27 per cent. were unknown, 14 per cent. by thorough-breds, 25 per cent. by Norfolk Trotters and 9 per cent. by Arabs. The chargers were got by thorough-breds6 This state of affairs is, no doubt, due to the fact that at no period of its existence has the Deccan ever been contaminated by coarse blood, and that its mares are more or less pure, whereas in other parts of India it is impossible to say to what coarse, common and remote ancestor your mare is going to throw back to. The drawbacks to the Deccan, however, are very great: it contains few mares, poor owners, and is very liable to famine, all of which militate against any marked progress ever being made in horse-breeding, and the work of years is thrown back by a single famine such as the one experienced last year. If the causes of rejection are carefully analyzed, it will be found that they work out very satisfactorily, and to a great extent prove that the buying of young stock in this part of India in expert hands need not be such a lottery as is commonly supposed, more especially when it is taken into consideration that stock which do not quite realize expectations, as far as height is concerned, for British Cavalry, can always be sent to Native Cavalry, providing care has been exercised in their purchase and they are suitable in other ways. Out of the number rejected one was a chance get received from the Madras Lancers, one was issued to the 20th Hussars from the Hapur Depôt, found unsuitable and returned to this Depôt to be sold, 3 cast for accidents and unsoundness, and 2 undersized which realized at auction Rs. 385 each. These figures further analyzed show that this Depôt was only answerable for 2 animals that did not grow sufficiently to enter either branch of the service, yet were good enough at 3½ years of age to realize the fair price of Rs. 385 each. Accidents and unsound- ness must occur and, therefore, cannot be compared in this table. (2).7 13. The number of remounts purchased at each place is given below :8 Number of mares covered. 19. The number of pony mares covered during the year is given below with comparative figures for the last two years :9 I regret to say I was unable to keep), and at every village I visited, the whole subject was carefully gone into by me with the assembled breeders, and as a last resource I ordered all Inspectors to travel with a donkey stallion from village to village. I obtained promises from several men that they would get their mares covered by donkey stallions which they never fulfilled. Considerable reluctance was shown by owners to get even wretched little mares, which graze along the sides of the road, covered, and only the persistence of the Inspectors and the promise of prizes at the shows gained an unwilling consent. This class of ani- mal was selected, because owners of better mares steadily refused, and it was thought that a start, no matter how bad, was better than attempting nothing. The opposition was steady from the very beginning, and no part of the Deccan showed any signs of giving way or taking up the industry. During the whole time I have been in the Deccan only on two occasions have I seen owners of their own free will bring their mares to be covered by donkey stallions. This alone will give some idea of the tremendous odds that the Department has been working against in endeavouring to establish an industry opposed alike to the prejudices and wishes of the people, and, as I have stated before, when the ryot realizes that money is to be made out of mule-breeding the industry may gra- dually become popular, but at present there is no market for a young mule, and until that is established any further attempt will be to court failure. This unsatisfactory state of affairs has been carried on for the last four years in the hope that time would effect an improvement, but as that improvement did not take place I was compelled to remove the stallions with the view of preventing further waste of Government money. Gujarát. 22. Identically the same efforts were made in this province as in the Deccan, and the following table will show that the result proved far from satisfactory.

Several of the State paddocks have purchased donkey stallions within the last few years, and quite recently three more ap- plications have been received. It is proposed, as soon as they are obtainable, to locate one or two donkey stallions in every paddock, and I trust that the industry, when fairly started, will flourish in this province. The Bhávnagar State, some 8 years ago, bred a few mules which are at present in the transport of the Imperial Lancers. They are without exception some of the finest I have ever seen in India, short.legged, with immense bone and very powerful, and prove without doubt that the climate and soil of Káthiáwár is well adapted for this purpose.

Mule-breeding was commenced in Sind in the year 1882 and the above table will show what progress has been made. The majority of the stallions have been concentrated in the Shikárpur and Jacobabad districts. But stallions have within the last few years been placed in the Hyderabad District, where the industry has taken root rapidly and promises to flourish. The Sindi, I think, prefers breeding a mule to a horse, and if only some scheme could be devised whereby a market could be found for all young mule stock, I feel sure that the industry would make very much more rapid progress than it has hitherto done. The proposed scheme of the Government of India, for allowing all mares whe- ther branded or not to be covered by donkey stallions, is a step in the right direction, although I wish to bring to the notice of Government that the rule of covering only branded mares has been more or less held in abeyance for several years, and the general principle followed out that no mare, no matter how bad she may be, is unfit to be mated with a donkey stallion, as it is an undoubted fact that some of our best and most shapely mules are out of the most unsound and ill-shaped mares in India. Parts of Sind can, therefore, be classed as dis- tinctly good, and capable of still further improvement. Breeding from donkey mares. 25. Owing to the failure which attended all efforts to breed mules in this Presidency an alternative scheme was suggested by the late Colonel Humfrey of covering donkey mares with selected Pegu-pony stallions. The subject of donkey mares was carefully gone into by me, and it was found that throughout this Presidency and in Sind the majority of the donkeys were either the property of bunnyas, who owned one or two, or small contractors, who owned from 20 to 30. The former are men who seldom breed from their animals, while the latter are generally very poor, and whose donkeys earn a precarious livelihood by grazing along the sides of the roads, and are worked long before they are capable of carrying a load. I saw no prospect of success attending a scheme where 90 per cent. of the donkey mares belonged to the above class of men, and could not see how it was possible for animals bred and reared under such adverse conditions ever to grow, and become useful for transport purposes. For this reason I was strongly opposed to trying the experiment of spending Government money on so hopeless a venture. 26. A short summary of the above goes to prove that under present con- ditions it is both a waste of time and money to attempt to breed mules in the Presidency Proper; that State aid in Káthiáwár will, no doubt, produce a certain number annually, but the conditions under which it is proposed to carry on the industry must necessarily ristrict any large output, at any rate for several years
11 to come ; and, the parts of Sind where the industry is established are distin ctly good, and that those portions which have recently taken to mule-breeding are promising and capable of extension.

The balance remaining on the 31st March 1898 is shown in the table below :14 Proper, and I see no reason why my camp during the cold weather should not be so arranged as to give every owner that wishes, an opportunity of bringing his mare to be branded. (3).15 II.16 Classes17 General Remarks.18 promising. There seems some doubt whether the system inaugurated, of hold- ing shows at the four following places, viz, Rájkot, Junágad, Wadhwán and Bhávnagar, is likely to be attended with the success that was anticipated, and that a return to Rájkot is to be recommended. It is yet early to form an opinion on this point, as only two shows have been held under the present system. In the ordinary course of events, the next show will be held at Rájkot and on its success or otherwise it will be possible to form a more definite opinion. The arrangements of the show were very good and the general management through- out excellent. Summary. 52. There were four horse shows during the year under report against five last year. Owing to the prevalence of bubonic plague, the Ahmednagar and Bhúj shows were abandoned and a show was held at Junágad in Káthiáwár. The total number of exhibits at all the shows was 2,602 against 3,064 last year, the decrease being particularly noticeable at Moro for reasons given under the review of that show. The total expenses amounted to Rs. 15,180, of which Rs. 11,023 were actually awarded as prizes and Rs. 4,157 were spent for other purposes. Government contributed Rs. 3,000 against Rs. 6,000 last year. Stallions whose produce won prizes. 53. Table XVI gives the number and class of stallions whose produce won prizes at several horse shows. It will be seen that the produce of 21 sires won 53 prizes, viz., 3 each of the first 3 classes and 44 of other classes. When compared with the last year's results these figures appear to be meagre, but the fact is that no horse show was held during the year at Ahmednagar, and com- plete information of the stock which won prizes at the Moro and Talhár shows has not been received. 54.

The Chiefs are anxious that the industry should be carried out on sound lines and are willing to introduce improvements so as to ensure their studs being a success. The mares in the various paddocks have during the past year been carefully examined by me, and only the best retained, the remainder being drafted or put aside for mule-breeding. It is proposed that a similar drafting take place annually and all vacancies filled up with the best home-bred fillies. This policy systematically carried out, for the next five or six years, will result in the Káthiáwár studs owning some of the very best brood stock in India. I need hardly point out that this step unheard of in Káthiáwár before, of doing away with old, barren and unsound mares, will at once show what vast strides have been made, and further prove that the Chiefs are now willing to accept advice and adopt recommendations for the well-being of their studs. All the studs have been supplied with good Arab sires, as these are obtain- able in the country, but considerable difficulty is experienced by them in pro- curing thorough-breds. Some of the States have applied for the services of thorough-breds on what appears to me to be conditions most favourable to Government. Taking all circumstances into consideration, and the position we now stand with regard to these studs, I trust that Government will be pleased to accede to their wishes, as these stallions will only be mated with big roomy mares, whose offspring placed under such favourable conditions should grow into typical remounts. I think that I can safely say that the majority of these studs are now in good working order and their future very promising. GENERAL REMARKS. Fodder Arrangements. 84. The total amount of fodder raised under departmental arrangements during the past year amounted to 72,745 lbs. and shows a distinct saving to Government of Rs. 951-8-0, which must be looked upon as fairly satisfactory taking into consideration the short time the experiment has been in working order and the disadvantageous conditions under which it was commenced. The small patch of land within the stallion stable enclosure was prepared for sowing early in May and the first seeds of jowári and guinea grass planted early in June after the first heavy shower of rain. These crops failed completely, as the season was very unfavourable and comparatively no rain fell until early in September. This necessitated a second sowing and entailed a certain amount of loss in time, labour and seed. The new well in the stallion stables was abandoned by the Public Works Department after sinking some 35 feet, when only a small quantity of water quite insufficient for irrigation purposes was obtainable. At a cost of Rs. 51, I made arrangements to sink a further depth of 5 feet and it resulted in a plenti- ful supply of water. I think it is possible to still further improve matters, and propose sinking 5 feet more during the coming hot weather, when it is anti- cipated an abundant supply will be obtainable. The whole area which this well can irrigate is now planted with guinea grass in a thriving condition, which will yield sufficient green fodder for all requirements throughout the year. One or two crops of jowári will be taken off the remainder of the enclosure and should be sufficient to keep the bullocks during the year. Some 120 grafted mangoes of the best varieties have been planted in the enclosure; they are doing remarkably well and should be a source of considerable income in a few years, 85. According to Government Resolution No. 2114, dated 24th March 1898, in the Revenue Department, complete control of the Padampur Kuran was assumed by this Department at the end of the official year, and a contract entered into by which the contractor engages to completely clean out all scrub jungle by the roots, make the necessary gates and enclose the kuran by a cactus fence impervious to cattle, on consideration that all cut wood becomes his property. This arrangement is, I think, satisfactory, as it entails no further expense to
29 Government, gives the Department a fair start with a thoroughly clean piece of land, fenced on all sides and capable of being made into a high class grass reserve, when it will be possible to cut and harvest the whole crop and entirely do away with the great waste of good grass that occurs annually in lands set aside for grass purposes, half of which are covered with useless scrub jungle. All fodder arrangements in connection with these horses are now complete and in full working order, and I anticipate a very large saving annually. The following statement gives receipts and expenditure, is worked out at contract rates, and shows a net profit to Government of Rs. 951-8-0 under the above system :30 Collectorates. 88. The Province of Sind is divided into the following collectorates,31 have always done good work, and I think that it would be advisable to endeavour to extend mule-breeding in these parts. Mares. The best mares are concentrated in the central portion of the district, and the north-cast and southern portions contain nothing but a few small weedy animals unfit for any purposes. Hyderabad. 91. The extreme southern portion is next to Jacobabad, I think, the most promising part of Sind and was opened up by me some four years ago. It was the only part of Sind where no attempts had been made to breed horses and mules, and it was, therefore, necessary that a certain amount of care should be exercised in our method of procedure. I realised the uselessness of attempting to tour in this particular tract until the Zamindárs and people had been made conversant with the wishes of Government on horse-breeding and with that view it was decided by Mr. Woodburn and myself that the quickest and best way to accomplish this end would be to hold a show at Talhár, the most central and convenient place in the division ; and a show was accordingly held in 1894. It was a success and the opportunity was taken of collecting all the most wealthy and influential Zamin- dárs and explaining to them the wishes and procedure of Government when opening up a new district for horse-breeding. The first year I endeavoured to brand mares and failed completely, as the whole country side was averse to it. The following year a few mares were branded at the show and Government stallions placed in the district, the year after a few more were branded, and some attempts made by the Zamindárs to utilize the horses. This year a complete detailed tour was made in the district, 446 mares were branded and all the horses had covered their full complement of mares. The success which has followed the policy adopted in this district leads me to suppose that it was the right one, and I feel sure that any undue haste in attempting to tour in a district when branding, &c., was unknown, could only have resulted in failure, instead of which this district is now in fair working order. The mares throughout are branded, and the people willing and anxious to carry on the work which took some three years to bring to its present pitch. The extreme northern portion has had stallions stationed there for several years, and by way of giving horse-breeding an impetus in these parts, it was decided to establish a show at Moro. The first one was held in February 1893 and has since become an annual institution. The influential Zamindárs take considerable interest in it, but the district does not contain many mares of any size. Mule-breeding. The same difficulty was experienced in this district with mule-breeding, but this has gradually been overcome, and the stallions are now doing good work. Stallions. This collectorate in 1893 contained two horse and two donkey stallions and at the end of this year five Government horse stallions, five Government donkeys, one Local Fund horse, and two private donkeys, and if the Mir of Khyrpur's territory is included, contains a total of 8 horses and 9 donkeys. Owing to the excessive work done by the horses in this district, I was anxious to place more stallions in the southern portion, but owing to financial difficulties the Local Board were unable to entertain my proposals, and operations were to some extent retarded on this account. Mares. The extreme southern portion contains good mares, supposed to be the descendants of a ship-load of Arabs wrecked on that coast, and the central portion only a few very indif- ferent and small mares, and the northern portion contains a few good mares but the majority small. Thar and Párkar. 92. This collectorate is, I think, valueless from a horse-breeding point of view. In the year 1893 I placed one stallion at Umar- kot and he covered 13 mares, the following year 5 and the year after 26. He was removed, and enquiries made as to the class of horse the Zamindárs would be likely to patronize, and elicited the following answer that, if a Kathi C. B. was obtainable, to send one, otherwise no horse was required.
32 It is needless to say none was sent. Mule-breeding. One donkey has been placed there and during the past year covered 27 mares. Karáchi. 93. The same remarks, more or less, apply to this collectorate as to Thar and Párkar, and it was found that a stallion located in different parts of it, covering a period extending some- thing like six years, did no work at all, and he was removed by me in 1894. There are no mares of any size in the whole of this collectorate. 94. A brief summary of the above facts will at once show that the Jacoba- bad Collectorate is the only one that can be rightly called a horse-breeding district and that the southern portion of the Hyderabad District, which has lately been opened up, is the next most promising, and that a very large portion of Sind contains practically no mares and is unsuitable for the industry. 95. My experience of Sind now extends over a period of six years and I would respectfully beg to state that during that time there are few parts of it of which I have not made myself thoroughly acquainted. I have averaged 50 days a year travelling through the Province and have come to the conclusion that the pure Sindhi would rather breed mules than horses, and would suggest that this industry be pushed to its very limit. All young stock bought for the Government rearing depôts have been bred by the Beluchis in the Jacobabad District, and not a single one, to my knowledge, has ever been bred and sold to Government by a Sindhi. 96. In the year 1892 the Province contained 16 horse and 20 donkey stallions, 3,437 branded mares and one horse show; at the end of March 1898 it contained the following :33 TABLE I.

Veterinary Major Morgan was in charge of the Department during the whole of the year, except from 15th October to 7th December 1897, when Veterinary Lieutenant Walker acted for him. The distance travelled by the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, was 9,296 miles (807 miles by road, 7,660 miles by rail and 829 miles by boat), against 9,114 miles during the preceding year. He visited the marginally noted districts and States, and paid six visits to Bombay. He inspected all the vete- rinary dispensaries, excepting the one at Bhadgaon, and attended all the shows. Horse and pony stallions on the register. 3. There were 66 horse and pony stallions on the register at the com- mencement of the year. Out of these, 8 stallions were removed from the register, 4 being destroyed and 2 sold as unserviceable, and one sold to the Cutch Dar- bár for stud purposes, and one transferred to Beluchistán. Among the stallions destroyed was the celebrated " Tom O'Shanter. " Two Thorough-bred English stal- lions were added during the year under report, but owing to exorbitant prices demanded, the purchase of Arab pony stallions had to be deferred to the com- mencement of the current year, when the Arab dealers, anxious to get back to their country, reduced prices. The number of stallions, standing at the close of the year, was thus 60, out of which 15 were Thorough-bred English, 1 half-bred, 4 Hackney and Norfolk Trotters, 39 Arab, and 1 country-bred. Stallions actually at stud work. 4. The effective strength or the actual number of stallions at stud work during the year fell from 59.52 to 58.82, of which 9.86 were working in Gujarat, 1403 in Sind and the rest in the Deccan. Mares covered. Province. 1896-9 7 1897-98. Deccan ... 32.29 23.33 Gujarát ... 29.70 29.41 Sind ... 33.65 32.78 Average ... 32.24 26.60 5. The total number of mares served by Government stallions was 1,565 or 354 less than during the preceding year. Out of these, 815 were covered in the Deccan, 290 in Gujarát and 460 in Sind, against 1,161, 265 and 493, respectively, during the preceding year. The average number of mares covered per stallion was 26.60, against 32.24 in the previous year. It will be seen, from the marginally noted figures, that this falling off was almost solely confined to the Deccan, owing to the famine and plague prevailing in that division. The certification system. 6. Only five out of the 36 officers empowered exercised their powers of granting certificates to mares fit for service by Government stallions, and they issued 37 certificates. From this it appears that little or no headway has been made ; at the same time, there are no reasons why the system should be abolished, and the Local and India Governments have been pleased to give a further trial to the system. (Vide Government Resolutions, Nos. 3668 and 4330, dated 2nd June and 1st July, respectively, 1898, Revenue Department.) Produce statistics. 7. Out of 1,919 mares covered during the preceding year, 714 foaled, 857 did not hold, and the result of 348 coverings was not known. The following statement shows the results for the different divisions of the Presidency :54 Province. Year. Percentage of produce. Percentage not held. Percentage unknown. Deccan 55 the place it should occupy in the system of horse-breeding. In paragraph 28 of his Administration Report for 1896-97, he writes :56 mares in the district are now branded. In the Deccan, he could not brand more than 115 mares, due to a large number of mares having been sent away or sold owing to famine, and the young stock being small and stunted. The number of branded mares standing on the register at the close of the year was 11,941. 15. The following table compares the average cost per horse, pony and donkey stallion, incurred during the year with that of the preceding year :57 Horse and mule-breeding under Local Boards and in Native States. 17. The Arab stallion "Maxim," maintained by the Hyderabad Local Board, covered as many as 63 mares during the year, which shows that his services are in great demand. The result of his previous year's coverings (23) is also satisfactory (48 per cent. foaled, 26 per cent. not held, and the rest unknown). The Board has also kept a donkey stallion recently presented to them by Khán Bahádur Ghullam Rasul Khán Jatoi. The Government stallions in Cutch have been purchased by the Darbár, and are now maintained at their own cost. In Káthiáwár, very satisfactory progress has been made. Some of the States are desirous of having Thorough-bred English stallions lent to them, and arrangements are being made to lend two Thorough-bred English stallions to Pálitána and Rájkot on certain conditions, by one of which the Superintendent has the first right of refusal of the produce got by those stallions. (Vide Gov- ernment Resolution No. 4636, dated 16th July 1898, Revenue Department.) It is also proposed to keep good pony stallions in the States to improve the breed of pony stock in the province. The mule-breeding industry appears to take a firm footing in Káthiáwár, especially in the Bhávnagar State, where there are very fine mules bred in the State. Cattle-breeding. 18 There are only two stud bulls at present maintained by Local Boards, one in the Panch Maháls and the other in Hyderabad. The former was purchased in 1891, and has since been handed over to a herdsman. The latter was purchased in February 1889, and covered 36 cows during the year under report. Veterinary Major Morgan deprecates violent out-cross of foreign blood, and in support of his remarks cites the case of the Katchi bull, which was purchased by the Hyderabad Local Board in 1894. This bull covered some 30 cows, several of which died whilst calving to him, and the majority of the calves died before reaching maturity, being unable to stand the climate. Horse shows. 19. Three shows, aided by Government, were held during the year, viz. at Jacobabad, Moro and Talhár. A show was also held at Junágad in Káthiáwár. Veterinary Major Morgan has given a detailed account of each of these shows, and the undersigned has no remarks to offer, other than those already made, on the reports submitted to Government. No show was held at Ahmednagar and Bhúj on account of the prevalence of plague. Cattle diseases. 20. The figures reported show that there were 12,648 attacks of epizootic diseases against 20,713 during the preceding year. Out of these, 5,918 or 46.79 per cent. proved fatal against 10,211 or 49.34 per cent. 57 percent, of the attacks were due to rinder- pest, 31 per cent. to foot and mouth disease, and the rest to other diseases. Rinderpest appeared in sixteen districts of the Presidency, and was responsible for 83 per cent. of the total number of deaths, and the districts, that suffered most heavily from it, were Upper Sind Frontier, Shikárpur and Thána. Veterinary Major Morgan is inclined to believe, though he has not sufficient materials to prove it, that rinderpest in this country will, in the course of years, become milder and milder in each successive generation, through the fact of a very large per- centage of the animals getting the disease and recovering, thereby becoming immune, and that they will, to a certain extent, transmit this immunity to their offspring. The Veterinary Graduate, appointed by the District Local Board of Ratná- giri, is still working in the district, and a Veterinary Inspector (who is not a graduate as stated by the Superintendent) has also been recently engaged by the District Local Board of Kolába to repress outbreaks of cattle diseases in the district. In view of the heavy mortality from which Kánara suffered annually, it was proposed to the Collector, last year, that the Board should enter- tain a Veterinary Graduate for at least a couple of years. No graduate has, however, been employed, chiefly for want of funds, but it is fortunate that the B 30258 district escaped, during the year under report, with the comparatively very small mortality of 315. Veterinary Dispensaries. 21 During the year under report, an itinerating Veterinary Assistant was appointed for the Hyderabad District. There were thus 12 stationary and five itinerating veterinary dispen- saries at the end of the year. The following statement shows a steady and satisfactory increase both in the number of patients treated and in the percentage of cures :59 promoting horse and mule-breeding industries in Sind and in his work generally. The assistance rendered him by the various officers named by him deserves also commendation. Miscellaneous. 23. The Superintendent again quotes instances of delay in the receipt of returns from district officers, who, it is hoped, will observe greater punctuality in future in forwarding them. Conclusion. 24. The work done by the Superintendent during the year under report was very satisfactory. A. BROWNLOW FFORDE, Acting Survey Commissioner and Director, Land Records and Agriculture.
No. 152-L OF 1898. Bombay Veterinary College, Parel, 18th May 1898. FROM THE PRINCIPAL, BOMBAY VETERINARY COLLEGE ; To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. SIR, I have the honour to submit the second Annual Report of the Glanders and Farcy Department in Bombay since the transfer of its control to me. The report is for the official year ending 31st March 1898. 2. The number of glandered horses destroyed during the year was 36, as against 36 and 26 for the period of fifteen months ending 31st March 1897 and the year ending 31st December 1895, respectively. The increase is due to the surreptitious importation of diseased horses from Moombra to Sardár Umar Jamal's commission stables in Bombay. Besides this the full complement of the Inspecting Staff being at work and careful inspections being made of all the stables, it was not likely that any cases could escape detection. 3. Thirty-eight horses were admitted to the Sewri Lazaretto. Out of these, 23 were on admission confirmed cases of Glanders or Farcy and 15 suspicious. Out of the suspicious cases, 13 developed Glanders and 2 were discharged. 4. Nine of the horses admitted to the Lazaretto belonged to the owners of carriages plying for hire, 24 came from the commission stables, and 5 were stray cases. 5. The breeds of horses that were admitted are as follows : 2 10. With the view to prevent the likelihood of horses suffering from Glanders being sent out by road, rail, or steamer, a proposal to inspect all horses leaving Bombay at the causeways, railway stations, and bandars is before Government. A similar scheme for the inspection of horses coming into Bombay otherwise than by sea should be brought into force. 11. The rules for. the working of the Act were revised under the sanction of Government and were made consistent with the transfer of the control to me. 12. Veterinary Lieutenant Baldrey, Assistant Principal, Bombay Veterinary College, and Chief Veterinary Inspector Fernandez were deputed to Moombra in the Kalyán Táluka of the Thána District to investigate an outbreak of Glanders amongst the horses of Sardár Umar Jamal that were located there. Veterinary Lieutenant Baldrey reported the results of his investigation, and steps are being taken to prevent the concealment of cases in the districts adjoining Bombay. The Inspector General, Civil Veterinary Department, made enquiries into the matter, and, incidental to this outbreak, proposed the application of the Glanders Act to places within a radius of 30 miles from Bombay, but Government, having found this measure impracticable as the local officers would not know for certain whether any places are within or without the limit, decided to apply the Act to the whole of the Thána and Kolába Districts, and to appoint the Principal, and the Assistant Principal, Bombay Veterinary College, and the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, as Veterinary Practitioners for the districts. 13. The disinfection of stalls and lines, where diseased horses were located, and the segregation of those that were in contact with them, have been strictly enforced and carried out in the presence of the Inspectors, as the present rules empower them to carry out these necessary measures, which the previous rules did not. 14. With a view to prevent the introduction of Tick Plague, Government ordered the inspection of all shipments of horses coming to Bombay from Australia, by the Glanders staff, with the consent of the owners, pending legislation to authorize the inspection of all horses and other animals imported into India. I have proposed to build a Lazaretto at the harbour for the isolation of any shipment wherein a tick plague case is detected. 15. The question of uniform for the Veterinary Inspectors is still in abeyance ; but it is a subject which I am anxious to see dealt with at an early date. As an instance of the necessity of uniform, a graduate of this College employed as a Cattle Inspector by the Bombay Municipality was lately assaulted, because he wore no distinguishing badge of office. The same has happened with one of the Inspectors under the Glanders Act, and may be repeated any day. 16. Owing to serious illness, abscess of the liver, I had to go on three months' privilege leave from 15th February last. During my absence Veterinary Lieutenant Baldrey acted for me and held control of the Department. 17. The Veterinary Inspectors performed their duties, under the super- vision of Chief Veterinary Inspector Fernandez, to my entire satisfaction. Mr, Fernandez continues to show zeal in his work. Conveyance allowance to the Inspectors has been sanctioned. 18. The clerk sanctioned has been attached to the College office, and the clerical work of the Department hitherto performed by Chief Inspector Fernan- dez will now be conducted by the Clerk under the supervision of the College Head Clerk, Mr. V. B. Phatak. 19. Appendix B is the financial statement. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, JAMES MILLS, Veterinary Major, A. V. D., Principal, Bombay Veterinary College.

No. 75. REVENUE DEPARTMENT. Bombay Castle, 6th January 1899. Letter from the Principal, Bombay Veterinary College, No. 152-L., dated 18th May 1898 2 3. Of the 66 horse and pony stallions borne on the register on 1st April 1897, four (inclusive of the thorough-bred English horse "Tam O'Shanter ") were destroyed, two were sold as being unfit for stud purposes, one was transferred to Baluchistan and one was bought by the Cutch Darbár. Owing to the demand of exorbitant prices by the dealers in Arab horses, no new stallions were purchased locally during the year under review, and with the addition of two thorough-bred English horses received from England the total number on the register on 3lst March 1893 stood at 60, of which 32 were located in the Deccan, 10 in Gujarát and 18 in Sind. In view of this decrease in the total registered number, the slight fall in the average number of stallions actually at stud work from 59.52 in 1896-97 to 58.82 in 1897-98 is in- considerable. While the total number of mares covered (1,565) by Government stallions and the average number served (26.60) by each stallion during the year under report show a considerable falling-off (which was mainly confined to the Deccan) as compared with the corresponding figures (1,919 and 32.24) of the preceding year, the produce results ascertained in the year under review are on the whole more satisfactory than those of 1896-97, the total number of foals produced from the previous year's coverings by Government horses and the average known produce per stallion being 714 and 11.99 in 1897-98 against 597 and 10.59 in 1896-97 respectively. It is, however, noticed that the produce results of Gujarát and Sind for the two years referred to show large fluctuations in the percentages of ' mares foaled ' and of ' those not held '. His Excellency the Governor in Council trusts that the introduction of the new village and táluka forms for the registration of branded mares and their produce by Government stallions, recently sanctioned in Government Resolution No. 4929, dated 30th July 1898, will ensure in future greater accuracy in the statistics of produce. 4. The total number of donkey stallions on the register fell from 28 at the commencement of the year under review to 24 at the end of the year, four being destroyed and none being added to the register during the period. Of these 22 were located in Sind, one in Gujarát and one in the Deccan. While the average number of donkey stallions actually at stud work in 1896-97 and in l897-98 was almost the same, viz., 25.40 and 25.34, the total number of mares covered and the average number served by each stallion fell from 753 and 29.64 in l896-97 to 713 and 28.13 in 1897-98 respectively, and the total number of known produce resulting from previous year's coverings and the average number of foals per stallion rose from 127 and 5.52 in 1896 97 to 181 and 7.12 in 1897-98 respectively. Sind mainly contributed to these results. In paragraphs 20 to 26 of his report Veterinary Major Morgan has reviewed the progress made in mule-breeding in the Deccan, in Gujarát and Káthiáwár and in Sind between the years 1881-82 and 1896-97 and has recorded his opinion that under existing conditions it will be a waste of time and money to carry on mule-breeding in the Presidency proper, but that in parts of Sind this industry is well established and promises to expand in future and that in Káthiáwár also there is a good field for its development. In their Resolution No. 4356, dated 4th July 1898, Government have already decided that a further continuance of the experiment; to establish mule-breeding in the Deccan and Gujarát is not desirable and have directed the Superintendent to dispose of the donkey stallions stationed in these provinces in the manner recommended by him. 5. During the year under review the Superintendent branded 1,544 mares (796 for horse and pony-breeding and 788 for mule-breeding) against 525 in 1896-97, as many as 82 per cent of them having been branded in Sind. Exclud- ing 113 mares removed from the register during the year owing to death or other causes, the total numbers of branded mares for horse, pony and mule-breeding remaining on the register on 31st March 1893 were 4,449, 5,045 and 2,447 respectively. Under the certification system in force 37 mares were certified by five officers during the year under report. The Superintendent points out
3 that the results of the past two years during which the system has been in force are very disappointing, as few of the officers appointed to issue certificates take any interest in the work, and suggests that the scheme may be abandoned, as owing to the removal of Sind from his jurisdiction he will be able to make more detailed tours annually throughout the Presidency proper and to so arrange his camps as to give an opportunity to every owner of mares to get them branded by the Superintendent. Government have, however, decided in their Resolution No. 3668, dated 2nd June 1898, to give a further trial to the system and will await the report called for from the Superintendent in paragraph 2 of that Reso- lution before taking any action on his present suggestion. 6. The number (465) of country-bred remounts purchased during the year exceeded that (304) of the preceding year by 161. Of the animals purchased only 94 or 20 per cent. were ascertained to be the produce of Government stallions. This small percentage is accounted for by the fact that, with the exception of the officers of the Remount Department, no officers who purchase remounts endeavour to find out the pedigree of the animals purchased by them. The number of colts castrated by the Salutris and Veterinary Assistants during the year was 87 against 148 and 151 in 1896-97 and 1895-96 respectively. This falling- off is attributed to the effects of famine and plague. 7. The total expenditure of the Department fell from Rs. 68,733 in 1896 97 to Rs. 67.878 in the year under review. Of this amount Rs 36,627 were charged to Provincial Revenues, Rs. 14,737 to Imperial Revenues and Rs. 16,514 to Local Funds. It is to be noted that the total expenditure of the year would have considerably exceeded the sanctioned allotment, had it not been for the fact that a saving of Rs. 7,748 effected during the year under the heads " Purchase of Stallions " and " Prizes at Horse-shows " was utilized in meeting the excess charges under the heads " Cost of Feed, &c.," " Pay of Officers, &c." and " Contingencies." The large increase in the cost of feed, keep, &c., of stallions during the year was mainly due to unusually high prices prevailing in the Deccan. The financial results of the arrangements made by the Super- intendent with the sanction of Government to obtain and raise fodder at Ahmed- nagar in order to effect economy in the the and keep of stallions at the Ahmed- nagar Depôt, as described in paragraphs 84 and 85 of the present report, show a net profit of Rs. 951-8-0. This, however, as observed by the Director of Land Records and Agriculture, is due to the high value of the grass obtained from the kuran, which is taken credit for at famine prices. Government learn with interest the successful efforts of Veterinary Major Morgan to find water for irrigation, and Government will await with interest the result of the cultiva- tion of guinea grass in the present year. Government trust the experiment of growing fodder for the Government stallions, instead of purchasing it, may prove successful. It is satisfactory to notice that the efforts made by the Superintendent to persuade cultivators to try experiments with oats in parts of the Presidency have met with response in Ahmedabad and Sind. 8. It is disappointing to learn from inquiries made by the Superintendent during the year under review in accordance with the orders conveyed in paragraph 9 of Government Resolution No. 8560, dated 24th November 1897, that, with the exception of the Local Boards of the Panch Mahals and Hyderabad which maintain stud-bulls, no District Local Boards take any interest in the improvement of cattle-breeding in their respective localities. The attention of the Hyderabad Local Board and of all District Local Boards should be invited to the opinion expressed by the Superintendent in paragraph 62 of the report. During the year outbreaks of cattle-disease were reported from 19 districts of the Presidency, of which 11 had the advantage of the services of Veterinary graduates, while no reports on the subject were received by the Superintendent from the districts of Sholápur, Surat, Hyderabad and Thar and Parkar. The total number of animals said to have been attacked
4 * (Inclusive of 2,200 attacks and 1,400 deaths reported after the close of the year 1896-97.) by various diseases and the number of fatal cases amounted to 12,648 and 5,918 in 1897-98 against 20,713* and 10,211* in 1896-97 respectively. Rinderpest alone was responsible for 7,295 and 4,906, or nearly 58 per cent. and 83 per cent. respectively of the total number of attacks and deaths reported, the districts which suffered most heavily from this disease being Upper Sind Frontier, Shikárpur and Thana. It is a pity that the District Board of Kánara still find themselves unable to entertain even temporarily the services of a Veterinary graduate for the district. 9. With the addition of one itinerating dispensary in the Hyderabad District, there were during the year under report 12 stationary and 5 itinerating Veterinary dispensaries in the Presidency, of which 16 were inspected by the Superintendent, who found the work done by all the Veterinary Assistants to be satisfactory, that of Messrs. Bhat, Maniar, Háji and Asudámal, in charge of the dispensaries at Ahmedabad, Nadiál, Karáchi and Hyderabad, being specially commended. It is satisfactory to observe from the statistics given by the Survey Commissioner and Director that since 1892-93 there has been a steady increase both in the number of animals treated and in the percentages of cures. The total number of animals treated at the several dispensaries rose from 19,614 in 1896-97 to 19,976 in 1897-98 and the percentage of those cured and relieved also increased from 84'30 to 85.59. The Commissioner in Sind should be invited to consider the suggestion made by Veterinary Major Morgan for utilizing the services of the Veterinary Assistant at Hyderabad in imparting Veterinary instruction to the students of the Agri- cultural Class there. 10. Government have perused with interest paragraphs 87 to 96 of the report under review, which contain a brief account of the capabilities of the several districts in Sind for horse and mule-breeding and of the progress made during the last six years, and an extract should be forwarded to the Inspector General, Civil Veterinary Department, for communication to the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Baluchistan. The keen interest and the marked ability and tact shown by Veterinary Major Morgan in the discharge of his duties in Sind have contributed to a very considerable measure of success in the develop- ment of horse and mule-breeding in that province, and Government cordially acknowledge the services of those district officers who have for many years past vigorously exerted themselves towards the attainment of the same object. 11. During the year under review 36 glandered horses were destroyed in Bombay under the operation of the Glanders and Farcy Act as compared with 36 destroyed in the preceding period of fifteen months ending 31st March 1897, the slight increase being attributed to the employment of the full complement of the inspecting staff and to careful inspections of all the stables. Out of 38 diseased animals admitted to the Sewri Lazaretto during the year (of which two were discharged), 9 belonged to owners of carriages plying for hire, 24 came from the commission stables and 5 were stray cases. The report submitted by Veterinary Lieutenant Baldrey on the sanitary condition of the hack-carriage and livery stables in Bombay has been disposed of by the Resolution of Government in the General Department, No. 3149, dated 3rd June 1898, and His Excellency the Governor in Council trusts that the Municipal Commissioner for the City of Bombay may be able to adopt early measures to remove the defects brought to notice in that report. As regards the proposed grant of powers to Inspectors under the Act for the inspection of private stables, due provision has been made in the Bill to amend the Glanders and Farcy Act, circulated with Government Resolution No. 7267, dated 12th November 1898, and these powers should, in the opinion of Government, suffice without the inspection of animals leaving the island.

No. 681 OF 1899. FROM THE SUPERINTENDENT, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency ; To THE UNDER SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. Camp Ahmednagar, dated 1st June 1899. SIR, I have the honour to submit, for the consideration of His Excellency the Governor in Council, the Annual Administration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department in the Bombay Presidency for the official year 1898-99. 2. Veterinary-Major Morgan, who has gone home on one year's furlough, is the permanent incumbent of the appointment of the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, and during his absence I have been acting for him, having taken over charge of the Department on 5th November 1898. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, F. S. H. BALDREY, Veterinary Lieutenant, Acting Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency.

ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT FOR THE OFFICIAL YEAR 1898-1899. PART I4 of casualties in ponies is due to the fact that a great many were destroyed as being old and worn out. Only one horse died from natural causes and no ponies. No stallion was sold during the year. Number present at close of year. 5. The following table shows the number and class of stallions present at the close of the year under report :[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page]

5 Stallions which produce the most suitable stock for army. 11. Table V shows that out of 61 remounts inspected, 37 were allotted to British Cavalry, 13 to Native Cavalry and 11 were rejected for being under height, and were sold by public auction at an average price of Rs. 217 as three and four-year olds. It will be seen that only two animals were purchased as being the produce of Norfolk Trotters; bearing in mind the number of stock got by them, this bears out what has already been stated that their produce is not at all satisfactory, although both the animals above mentioned were retained as fit for British Cavalry. The stock produced by thorough-bred English, viz., 22, shows the high percentage of 68.18 as being fit for British Cavalry, only 13.64 per cent. were rejected, the remaining 18.18 per cent. going to Native Cavalry. This will bear out what Veterinary-Major Morgan remarked last year as to the high quality of the stock produced from the Deccan mare by the thorough-bred English. The stock produced by Arab, viz., 13, shows an increase of 2 over last year, and the number, viz., 7, allotted to British Cavalry is an increase of 6 over last year. This shows a distinct im- provement on the class as compared with last year, although the number of rejections is increased. The average price realised for these rejections was the high one of Rs. 239. The remaining stock inspected were the produce of Australians and sires unknown, though from their make and shape in the latter case appear to be got by Government stallions. The produce of Austra- lians shows the high percentage of 80 for British Cavalry and 20 for Native Cavalry and no rejections. Those from unknown sires show a percentage of rejections as 20.05, Native Cavalry 31.58 and British Cavalry 47.37. These figures, with regard to Australian sires, compare very favourably and point to the utility of purchasing thorough-bred sires from Australia at a much lower price than what they are purchased for in England, and which get equally good, if not better, stock. It will be seen that out of 61 head of stock inspected, only 8 were purchased outside the Presidency Proper, i.e., 5 in Sind and 3 in the Nizám's territory. The remainder of the stock were bred in the Presidency Proper. These figures compare very favourably. (2).6 Place. Number. Place. Number.

The following table will show the number of mares removed from registers:9 28. The rule A under Government Resolution, Revenue Department, No. 6985, dated 21st August 1894, whereby certificates can only be issued in districts where the number of branded mares has not reached an average of 50 per stal- lion, is not observed. Owners generally failed to produce the certificates with the mares, and great difficulty was experienced in ascertaining whether all of them were certified or not. Only 22 mares bearing certificates were inspected and branded during the year. Almost all officers are unanimous in stating that owners do not avail themselves of the opportunity offered them of having their mares certified under the system. As the number of branded mares in every breeding district has already reached, in some cases exceeded, an average of 50 per stallion, the system cannot be made applicable to this Presidency if the above quoted rule A is to be strictly adhered to. It is, therefore, again recom- mended that the system should be discontinued. 29. It appears from their Resolution in the Revenue and Agricultural Department, No. 11-124-2, dated 7th April 1899, that the Government of India also do not approve of the continuance of the system in this Presidency. (3).10 (4).11 supply of mules is undoubtedly inadequate to the demand in India for transport purposes. The mule is easy to breed, can be reared much cheaper than horse stock, and will always command a comparatively higher price. I would strongly advocate a continuance of a class of baggage ponies. As the scheme of holding the Káthiáwár show at different places in turn appears to have been attended with very little success, the Judges and all con- cerned have pronounced Rájkot to be the best centre. I quite agree with the remark of the Political Agent with regard to the encouragement of the private breeders. They should receive all the encourage- ment possible by receiving prizes at shows, especially for the brood mare class and remounts. It is to be hoped that all Darbárs will allow the free use of their stallions amongst the Girásia class. With regard to the keeping of young stock by Girásias until they reach the remount age, all owners should be freely informed that young stock which are got by approved sires out of big mares will, always, be purchased by the Re- mount Agent when one year old; providing they reach the proper standard, so that the expense of further keep to them is obviated. I am glad to see the suggestion by the Political Agent that Darbárs should buy young stock has been received with favour. With regard to the breeding of remounts, I think, it will be very satisfactory if the breeding of Light Cavalry horses should be successful. No hope need be entertained with regard to breeding Gun horses, and the successful breeding of Cavalry remounts will only be attained by careful nursing of the young stock. This can only be attained, as the Political Agent suggests, by those Girásias who are too poor to feed their animals by placing them in Darbár paddocks or selling to the Remount Agent. The amount expended in prizes appears somewhat high, but as this is all voluntarily given, I would not for a moment suggest that it should be diminished and agree with the Secretary that it should be never less than Rs. 3,000. It is certainly to be regretted that the Remount Agent was unable to attend the show; no doubt he will endeavour to do so next year. Summary. 39. There were two horse shows during the year under report, in the Presidency proper against one last year. The total number of exhibits at these two shows was 937 against 855 as shown in Table XV. As the Deccan show was abandoned in 1897-98, the figures of 1896-97 are taken for comparison. It will be seen that there was an increase of 82 exhibits. Although there was a great fall in the Deccan Show, it was more than compensated by the number returned by the Káthiáwár Show. The stock exhibited "was in perfect condition and speaks volumes for the recu- perative power of the country that has suffered so severely from the effects of famine for two successive years. The total expenditure amounted to Rs. 8,398-15-0, of which Rs. 4,715 were actually awarded as prizes and Rs. 3,683-15-0 were spent for other expenses. Government contributed Rs. 2,005. Stallions whose produce won prizes. 40. Table XVI gives the number and class of stallions whose produce won prizes at the Ahmednagar horse show. It will be seen that the produce of 20 Government sires won 63 prizes, viz., 9 each of the first three classes and 36 of other classes. When compared with the last year's results these figures appear to be satisfactory. No information under this head was received for the Rájkot Show. 41.

13 Graduates. In all cases where cattle-disease of a contagious nature has been prevalent, segregation and isolation have been adopted as far as possible. It is to be regretted that the Collector of Thána, in whose district rinderpest, foot and mouth disease and surra were prevalent, was unable to employ a Veterinary Graduate on account of want of funds due to the excessive expenditure in con- nection with plague. It is to be hoped that next year a Graduate may be employed. Special visits of the Superintendent to investigate outbreaks. 47. In April 1898 there was an outbreak of anthrax amongst the horses belonging to the Mounted Police at Sholápur. A Veterinary Graduate was specially deputed, and owing to the apparent urgency of the outbreak, Veteri- nary-Major Morgan proceeded himself and found that on the 25th March a horse belonging to the Mounted Police was attacked with anthrax at a village called. Rámlál, Akalkot, some three miles from Sholápur, was brought into Sholápur and died on the 27th of March. On the 5th of April a second horse was attacked at the same place, brought into Sholápu r and died on the 11th of April. On the 9th of April a third horse was attacked at Sholápur and died on the 12th April. The outbreak is attributed to the horses, whilst on tour with the Col- lector, being allowed to graze on land tainted with anthrax germs at Rámlál, Akalkot, or being given grass collected from the same source. The remaining five horses at Sholápur were examined and found to be healthy. Careful en- quiries were also made with regard to the feeding and watering arrangements, and with the exception of the general surroundings and sanitary arrangements of the stables, which leave much to be desired, there was no further danger to be apprehended at Sholápur. The necessary instructions for disinfecting the boxes, &c., were forwarded to the District Superintendent of Police. 48. I visited Bassein in the Thána District in November 1898 to investigate the outbreak of surra prevalent amongst the tonga ponies there. A detailed report has already been submitted to Government and the following is a synopsis :14 dangerous of the wells and gave instructions to disinfect all stables, fittings, &c., and to bury the carcasses of diseased animals at a depth of 6 feet covered with a thick layer of quicklime at some distance from the town and in a position from which there will be no drainage towards any inhabitable place. 49. I visited the outbreak in the Ahmedabad District, but failed to find rinderpest, and only saw foot and mouth disease and variola. An itinerating Veterinary Graduate was recommended, but this was not done for want of funds. The following is a synopsis of my report to the Collector :15 that I should work as a preliminary measure at the Sewri Lazaretto until some- thing definite was ascertained. Rinderpest is always available in Bombay and, moreover, the requisite instruments and appliances were to be had from the Bombay Veterinary College. My experiments up to date are not finished and I, therefore, cannot report fully upon them. I may, however, state that on account of the mild form of rinderpest great difficulty has been found in cultivating a serum. I have found that a great many of the animals I have purchased are already immune from the disease, either from having had a previous attack or having inherited the immunity. It will on this account be very hard to com- pare the success or otherwise of these experiments with those carried out in South Africa, where the disease is an acute epidemic as compared with the endemic form found here (ride my letter No. 365, dated 23rd March 1899, printed as Appendix A, showing the similarity of rinderpest in this country and in South Africa). 52. At the instance of the Inspector-General, Civil Veterinary Department, enquiries were made in the various districts in this Presidency with regard to the prevalence of rabies and warbles, and the following reports were submitted. Rabies. 53. The statistics with regard to cases of rabies amongst animals are not as reliable as they should be, as many isolated cases in all probability are never reported. The number of reported cases of all animals affected by rabies in the past year is 87, all of which either died or were destroyed. There was only one case amongst wild animals reported. This was a jackal. There is one recorded case, that of a buffalo, being bitten by a rabid dog without any result. As far as I can gather from the imperfect statistics that are kept, there is a very slight increase in the number of cases with the exception of the Thána District which accounts for 58 of the cases above reported. The cause of this large number is probably due to the fact that Thána is in immediate connection with the town of Bombay, in which place rabies is always prevalent, and the reason why the number of cases is an increase on previous years is due to the fact that a large number of homeless dogs are wandering about as the result of their owners having died of plague, this disease having been very prevalent in Thána during the last year. I have made suggestions to Government that greater care should be taken in the reporting of all cases of rabies, and that further precautions should be taken by the Police authorities for the destruction of all homeless wandering dog's, as it is a fact that these dogs become affected by the disease, and form more ready means for the dissemination of the contagion than dogs who are kept under control. It has been recommended that this disease should be included in C. V. D. Form II, and a short synopsis of symptoms is given below:16 and the fact that they are, as I have already said, almost invariably in the croup. The natives here call a disease "Mara," which name is similar to Mura, and is caused by jowári, but it is by eating the young shoots, and causes hoven, and death from that cause. I shall make further enquiries during the months of July to September, when further information may be elicited. As to treatment, I should advise the application of Stockholm tar to the back of cattle who are turned out as a preventive. IV.17 allowed to whoever required them, free of cost, for some time in the begin- ning. If the experiment proved successful, and demand for their services increased, a small fee may be imposed and their number increased in proportion to their demand for service. Mr. Maconochie, the Collector of Sholápur, is exactly of the above opinion and has actually given effect to it by making arrangements to purchase a good Khilari bull from the Jath State, and to keep it at Sholápur City as a beginning. He wants to extend the system if it works well. The question of improving the breeds of cattle is a delicate one and difficult of solution, more especially so in the Deccan, where the improvement is greatly needed. The Deputy Director of Agriculture, who was consulted in this matter, states that, if the experiment is tried, it should in the first instance be in Guja- rát, where the natural conditions are very favourable. The Deccan districts be left alone until some experience is gained in a more suitable district. When replies from all the Collectors are received, the matter will be carefully consi- dered and a full report be submitted to Government. Cattle Fairs and Shows. 56.

This is very satisfactory, as there are always many mares in the regi- ments which from breakdowns and other causes are unfit for work, yet will breed very good mules. 75. During my tour in Gujarát I noticed that the horse owners in parts bordering on Káthiáwár strongly objected to their mares being branded. They, moreover, object to the use of Government sires, as they prefer the Káthi breed. In the eastern part of Gujarát the mares are small but of a good quality, and I considered it advisable to place a stallion at Parántij. In the southern part of the Kaira District the owners are very keen, and I branded a considerable number of mares this year at Borsad, where I have recommended to place a stallion when the arrangements for his stabling are completed. I visited Surat for the purpose of branding mares with the intention of placing a stallion there, but the number of mares inspected did not warrant my doing so. The condition of horse-breeding in the Deccan is still very satisfactory although the breeders have suffered terribly from the effects of famine for the two previous years. They are also very much inconvenienced by the restriction imposed by plague regulations, many of them being afraid to venture so far as the various stallion stands. In the Sátára District the same conditions have been prevalent both as regards famine and plague, which accounts for the small number of coverings in that district. The class of mares, especially in the Tásgaon Táluka, I noticed to be very good, though the number was small. Fodder Arrangements. 76. In May and June the land within the stable enclosure was prepared for sowing. Nearly three-fourths of this was sown with jowári and the remain- ing one-fourth with guinea grass and lucerne, as the well water is not sufficient to irrigate the whole of the area. Although the rainfall was not very favourable, jowári and guinea grass throve well and gave a good outturn. Lucerne, however, completely failed owing to blight. The outturn of grass in the Padampur kuran was more than anticipated. The total amount of fodder raised under the departmental arrangements was 227,547 lbs. against 72,745 lbs. last year. All the hay from the kuran is put in two stacks, one of which is still intact and will be preserved or sold according to the seasonableness or otherwise of the current year's rainfall. The well was further sunk at a cost of Rs. 47 during the year under report as was proposed; still it fails to irrigate any crop during the hot weather, and the water is only sufficient for ordinary purposes of drinking. The services of the "bhisty" were dispensed with, as the water is sweet and thus a saving of Rs. 96 is effected annually. The following table, worked out at contract rates, gives details of expenses and outturn:24 It will be seen from the above table that there is profit in both the arrange- ments, viz., Rs. 41-6-1, on account of grass raised in the stable enclosure and Rs. 741-4-11 in the kuran. The diminution in profit is due to the fact that grass is very much cheaper this year. District. Name of return. Date of receipt. Násik ... Itinerating Veterinary Dispensary Report ... ... 17th May.

Copy of letter No. 365, dated 23rd March 1899, from the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, to the Under Secretary to Government, Revenue Depart- ment, Bombay. "With reference to paragraph 3 of Government Resolution, Revenue Department, No. 1596, dated 28th February 1899, I have the honour to submit my report on the questions raised therein as follows :44 "6. In any outbreak which occurs in India, where it has not been seen for some years, the mortality will be seen to be very high. Amongst those who do not become affected or recover, it cannot be known that they have not already suffered from the disease in some or other dis- trict, and as I have already said, a great deal will depend upon the individual attention which can be given to them. In South Africa practically no individual medical treatment can be adopted where the numbers are so immense. Having regard to the pecuniary aspect of the efficacy of adopting any preventive or curative measure that cannot be decided until something has been tried, the present estimated loss from rinderpest in India is 57,760 head of cattle, which is roughly equivalent to 10 lákhs of rupees. The figures are certainly alarming and worthy of consideration. Would the spending of some few thousands of rupees be felt in face of this sum? And in the event of success succeeding the effort, the reward would certainly be com- mensurate with the outlay. From the results of experiments conducted in South Africa there is every chance of success, and I am quite of opinion that the serum method of preventive in- oculation should be tried. I beg to refer you to my report on serum inoculation written from the Bombay Veterinary College when I was Assistant Principal in July 1897." (True Copy) F. S. H.

Fees paid by wealthy people for the treatment of their animals brought in the sum of Rs. 712-10-0 to the institution, and speaks much, I think, for its popularity. The receipts of the shoeing forge also brought in Rs. 635-2-0 as against Rs. 254-4-0 last year. The report is interesting and I think clearly shows the value of the institution and the energetic and satisfactory manner in which the Veterinary Graduate carries out his duties. Rs. a. p.

REVIEW BY THE SURVEY COMMISSIONER AND DIRECTOR, LAND RECORDS AND AGRICULTURE. No. A/8317 OF 1899. Poona, 29th November 1899. Submitted to Government. As directed in Government Resolution No. 2447, dated 8th April 1899, Reve- nue Department, the Provincial Report for Sind submitted by the Superintend- ent, Civil Veterinary Department, Beluchistán and Sind, is appended to the Presidential Report. The Superintendent's tour. Ahmedabad, Kaira, Surat, Khándesh, Násik, Ahmed- nagar, Poona, Sholápur, Sátára, Belgaum, Dhárwár, Thána, Pálanpar, Rájkot, Bhávnagar, Junágad, Vánká- ner and Morvi. 2. The Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay, was under the charge of Veterinary Major Morgan till the 5th November 1898, when he went on furlough. Veterinary Lieutenant Baldrey acted for him during the rest of the year. The distance travelled by these officers was no less than 1,008 miles by road and 8,348 miles by rail2 The number of produce per stallion for the Deccan fell off during the year owing to the smaller number of mares covered last year on account of famine as already remarked, but the percentage results are satisfactory. In Gujarát, on the contrary, though the number of coverings effected during 1897-98 was almost the same as that during 1896-97, the results attained were not satisfac- tory. The average percentage of produce, however, shows an increase and that of unknown result a decrease. Forms for the registration of mares and their produce, as sanctioned by Government Resolution No. 4929, dated 30th July 1898, have been introduced, and it is hoped that greater accuracy in the statistics of produce will be attained in future. Relative merits of stallions as foal-getters. 7. As regards the relative merits of the different classes of stallions as foal- getters the subjoined statement comparing the average percentages of known produce to mares covered for each of the classes shows that the country-bred horse ranks first, the Arab pony second and Arab horse third, closely followed by the thorough-bred English, while the Norfolk Trotter and the country-bred pony occupy the lowest rank. Last year, however, the Norfolk Trotter was in the first class with the country-bred horse:3 Year. THOROUGH-BRED ENGLISH. NORFOLK TROTTER. ARAB. Number inspect- ed. British Cavalry. Native Cavalry.

He found that most of the mares fit for branding in the Presidency proper had been already branded. The number of branded mares standing on the register at the close of the year was 6,002. The certification system. 12. The system of allowing unbranded mares to be covered by Govern- ment stallions on certificates granted by select district officers was continued during the year under report. Six officers out of the 35 empowered exercised their powers and issued 90 certi- ficates. As the number of branded mares in every breeding district has reached, and in some cases exceeded, the limit fixed under the rules of an average of 50 mares per stallion, the system has been discontinued under Government Reso- lution No. 4071, dated 13th June 1899, Revenue Department. Owing to the removal of Sind from his charge, the Superintendent is now in a position to devote more attention to the subject. Feeding and other charges. 13. The following table compares the average cost per horse and pony stallion incurred during the year with that of the preceding year exclusive of Sind:5 Khán Bahádur Ghullam Rasulkhán Jatoi also kept a donkey stallion named Shikárpur at his own expense. In Káthiáwár, horse-breeding is making satisfactory progress and mule- breeding has taken a firm footing. Nine head of young stock, including 4 mules, were purchased. Under Government Resolutions Nos. 4636 of 16th July 1898 and 6526 of 12th October 1898, Revenue Department, it was resolved to lend the two thorough-bred English stallions Triumph and Montezuma to Pálitána and Rájkot respectively. But the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, subsequently reported that Montezuma had never become properly acclimatized and was in too poor condition to be sent, and that there was no other horse available for the purpose (vide Government Resolution No. 7690, dated 28th November 1898, Revenue Department). Thus only Triumph was lent to Páli- tána, and the Superintendent's reports now shows that the Thákore Sáheb did not agree to the conditions proposed, and the stallion has been taken over by Rájkot. Bhávnagar is also anxious to have the loan of a stallion when avail- able. Cattle breeding. 16. No information about the working of the stud bull kept by the District Local Board of Hyderabad has been received by the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Beluchistán and Sind. In their report on the Ahmednagar Show the Honorary Secretaries sug- gested that a cattle-breeding department, similar to the Government horse- breeding department, should be established, but the suggestion has not been taken up on account of the great difficulties pointed out by Mr. Mollison (vide Government Resolution No. 5499, dated 7th August 1899, Revenue Department.) The Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department. Bombay, in paragraph 55 of his report recommends that stud bulls of undoubted quality and breed should be purchased by Local Boards and dedicated to some deity. The Inspector- General in paragraphs 1023 to 1027 of his annual report for 1897-98 makes the same suggestion, The report promised by the Superintendent on completion of the enquiries he is making from Collectors will be awaited. Horse Shows. 17. Two shows were held in the Presidency proper6 "other diseases" in Sind, the nature of which the Superintendent has not explained. From a comparison of tables M. & N. given by the Superintendent it will be seen that the same numbers are returned in both the tables as regards Karáchi, which leads to the suspicion that even ordinary cases treated by the Veterinary Assistant are included in Table M. as epidemic diseases. Table M. also shows that cattle-disease prevailed in Karáchi and Hyderabad, though the Superintendent in paragraph 4 of his report states that reports were received in the prescribed form from all districts. This office has not received from any of the district officers in Sind. excepting the Collector of Karáchi, copies of reports that may have been submitted by them to the Superintendent during the year under report. As regards the Presidency proper also, the Superintend- ent in paragraph 44 of his report has referred to Kaira as an instance of a dis- trict not reporting cattle-disease in the prescribed form and suspects that cattle- disease though prevalent in certain other districts was not reported. The attention of the district officers concerned both in the Presidency proper and in Sind may be invited to the orders contained in Government Resolution No. 5220 of 19th July 1893, Revenue Department. Under Government Resolution No. 4699, dated 6th July 1899, Revenue Department, Collectors are also to report cases of rabies. At the instance of the Inspector-General, Civil Veterinary Department, enquiries were made regarding warbles, but the officers consulted have reported that it is unknown in this Presidency. Owing to the difficulty experienced by the Superintendent in obtaining the serum, the results of his experiments at the Sewri Lazaretto in connection with rinderpest have been inconclusive. Veterinary Dispensaries. 19. Including the Veterinary officers employed by the Ratnágiri and Kolába District Local Boards at their own expense, there were 19 Veterinary Assistants working in the Presidency Proper and Sind. The following statement shows satisfactory results: 7 dispensary building is approaching completion. It is hoped that steps will be taken at an early date to provide suitable accommodation for the Surat, Jalgaon and Belgaum dispensaries and to find a more convenient locality for the Shikár- pur dispensary. It is understood that the authorities of the College of Science are unwilling to accept the proposal made by the Superintendent, Civil Veteri- nary Department, in paragraph 62 of his report that Mr. Judah Hyam should remain in sole charge of the Poona dispensary. The Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Beluchistán and Sind, states that the suggestion origi- nally made by Veterinary Major Morgan, that the services of the Veterinary Assistant at Hyderabad should be utilized in giving veterinary instruction to the students of the Agricultural Class, has been re-opened. The suggestion has been approved in Government Resolution No. 3185, dated 6th May 1899, Reve- nue Department. Miscellaneous. 20. The Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay, complains in the concluding portion of his report that some of the reports and returns due from district officers were received late. The attention of the officers concerned may be invited to the orders contained in paragraph 11 of Government Resolution No. 8560, dated 24th November 1897, Revenue Department, requiring them to furnish the required information by l5th April. Conclusion. 21. The work done by both the Superintendents was satisfactory. W. P. SYMONDS, Acting Survey Commissioner and Director, Land Records and Agriculture.
No. 167-L. OF 1899. From THE PRINCIPAL, BOMBAY VETERINARY COLLEGE; To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. Bombay Veterinary College, Parel, 18th May 1899. SIR, I have the honour to submit the Annual Report of the working of the Glanders and Farcy Department in Bombay, including animal diseases in general, for the official year 1898-99. 2. Five horses were destroyed for glanders during the year as against 36 in 1897-98. These five cases were detected in the first quarter of the year2 The Australian imports were 1,3563 12.The law relating to glanders and farcy has been amended by Act XIII of 1899. The additional powers now given to Inspectors under Section 5 of the Act permits them "to enter and search any field, building or other place for the purpose of ascertaining whether there is therein any horse which is diseased," and does away with the limitations heretofore placed upon entry and search. The revised Act also provides for the use of tests and isolation of horses sub- jected thereto, and for the recovery of the expense of detaining, isolating and testing horses from owners or persons in charge. These new powers will, I feel sure, tend to facilitate the working of the Department, and, in time, to eradicate glanders from the City, a disease which but a few years back was enzootic here. 13.An Act, the Live-stock Importation Act of 1898, has been passed with the view to deal more minutely and specifically with animal diseases likely to be brought to this country from abroad. Under Government Resolution, Revenue Department, No. 4871, dated 27th July 1898, I was deputed to form one of the members of the Committee, which assembled at Poona, to draw up the draft rules under Section 4 of the Bill (Live- stock), which are now before Government for approval. The draft rules were circulated, under the orders of Government, to all the leading firms and others interested in the horse trade of Bombay, and, practically speaking, they were accepted as they stood. 14.Both rinderpest and foot and mouth disease have existed in the City, more especially during the latter part of 1898 and the early months of 1899. The latter disease was of a most virulent type, and a few cases made their appear- ance among the cattle of the Commissariat and Transport Department and the Gun Carriage Factory; but prompt preventive measures were taken, with the result that the disease made no headway; in fact, it never got beyond the animals that were primarily affected. In November 1898 I addressed the Municipal Commissioner for the City, pointing out that cases of rinderpest were in existence, and recommending that a spot be selected for the isolation and treatment of cattle suffering from the disease. This was not carried out for want of funds and for the reason that the treatment of cattle diseases, which is alleged to be expensive, is not worth the cost, because of the low price of cattle. As cattle disease still existed in March of this year, I again addressed the Municipal Commissioner, drawing his attention to the fact, and making certain recommendations and, I am glad to say, that a segregation hospital has been established and systematic treatment is being carried out. A notification was also published by the Commissioner under Section 434 of the Bombay Municipal Act of 1888, embodying certain repressive measures, but the notification only included foot and mouth disease and not rinderpest, although the latter disease existed at the same time. In this office letter No. 88-L., dated 16th March 1899, I asked, through Government, that the Municipal Commissioner be requested to furnish a weekly report on Civil Veterinary Department Form II of all cattle diseases existing in the City, and in their Resolution, General Department, No. 1459, dated 29th March 1899, Government were pleased to sanction this arrangement. 15.Under Government Resolution, Revenue Department, No. 73, dated 6th January 1899, experiments in connection with the hides of animals that had died of rinderpest were conducted at the Government Lazaretto for animals. One series of experiments was carried out, followed by a second, quite indepen- dently of each other, the results of which were, that it was found impossible to convey rinderpest to healthy animals through the medium of hides taken from those dead from the disease, after being prepared for export according to the native method. Full details of the experiments were conveyed to Government in my reports Nos. 46-L., 75-L., and 114-L., dated 10th February, 3rd March and 11th April 1899, respectively. Opportunity was taken of the presence of rinderpest at the Lazaretto to conduct experiments in regard to bile as a prophylactic agent, a report of which was submitted in my No. 122-L., dated 18th April 1899.
4 16.It is a pity that the use of tuberculin is not more generally known than it is at present. As to its value, one case that came under notice during the year is worthy of record. A cow was brought for inspection with the following history. It had been purchased from a native dealer some weeks previously with a calf at her foot. The milk she yielded was given to a European infant which brought on diarrh5 Island for a quarantine depôt for horses. A report on this subject was submit- ted to Government in my letters No.407-L. and 15-L., dated 26th October 1898 and 12th January 1899 respectively. 25. Government have been pleased to sanction the wearing of uniform by the Inspectors employed under the Glanders Act, and have allowed a monetary grant to each man to go towards its upkeep. This is a measure which will greatly assist the Inspectors in the performance of their duties, and leave no doubt on the public mind as to who they are and what functions they have to carry out, more especially when entering private stables. 26. In this office letter No. 294-L., dated 19th August 1898, a recommen. dation was made to Government that the Department should be designated the "Animal Diseases Department for the City of Bombay" in view of the fact that other work than that connected with the Glanders Act will have in future to be carried out in connection with the Live-stock Importation Act and in other directions. Another matter, too, brought forward in the letter mentioned above, was that the Controlling Officer of the Department should be designated "Chief " or "Director." 27. With the view to keep the Department fully informed in regard to cattle-diseases in the Australian Colonies, Government have permitted the purchase of the "Australasian" and the "Sydney Mail" newspapers. A photographic camera and an incubator with burner and thermoregulator have been purchased under the orders of Government for the use of the Depart- ment. 28. The Veterinary Inspectors performed their duties to my satisfaction, under the immediate supervision of Chief Veterinary Inspector Fernandez, who has on all occasions given me every assistance, and I cannot but attribute much of the success that has attended the operations of the Department during the year under report to the attention the Inspectors generally have paid to their duties. Mr. V. B. Phatak, the Head Clerk, and his assistants have had extra labour thrown upon them owing to the increase in correspondence, and have worked to my satisfaction. 29. Appendix 7 is the financial statement which shows a saving of Rs. 1,150. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, J. BRODIE-MILLS, Veterinary-Major, A. V.
