SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit the Triennial Report on Vaccination for the years 1911-12, 1912-13 and 1913-14 I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient Servant, E. C.

TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION, BIHAR AND ORISSA, FOR THE YEARS 1911-12, 1912-13 and 1913-14. 1. THE VACCINATION STAFF. Vaccination in the Province of Bihar and Orissa is carried on chiefly by a special Vaccination staff, the members of which are either licensed or paid. Licensed Vaccinators are employed throughout the mufassil in the Patna, Tirhut, Bhagalpur and Chota Nagpur Divisions and in some parts of the-Orissa Division. Paid Vaccinators are employed in all Municipal towns and in the Puri and Sambalpur districts of Orissa. In some instances also the District Boards employ a certain number of paid Vaccinators throughout the year for emergent work in the mufassil at times when licensed Vaccinators are not available. The average number of Vaccinators employed each year during the three years 1912-14 was 1,154. This number is slightly in excess of the average number employed during the previous three years 1909-11. Of these Vac- cinators 1,022 were licensed and 132 were paid. 2. OPERATIONS PERFORMED BY THE VACCINATION STAFF. The average number of operations performed each year between 1912-14 was 1,311,674, while between 1909-11 the average number was 1,276,949. Of these operations 97.48 per cent. were primary and 2.51 re-vaccinations. There was a remarkable and unexplained fall of 99,152 in the number of re-vaccinations performed. The fall was shared by every district in the Province except the Santal Parganas, and in that district the increase was under 300. It was greatest in Cuttack in which district the number of re- vaccinations fell short by 26,755 and in the three hill districts. The average number of operations performed annually by each Vaccinator was 1,137. 3. HIGH RATES OF MORTALITY FROM SMALL-POX IN THE DISTRICTS AND THEIR RELATION TO VACCINATION. The provincial death rate from small-pox during the last five years was .27. It was highest in the districts of the Patna Division (.66). In the districts of the Tirhut Division it was .12, in those of the Bhagalpur Division .24, in the Chota Nagpur Division .27 and in the Orissa Division .16. Patna Division. In the Patna district the rate of mortality from small-pox during the last five years (1.26) was double that of any other district in the Province, and the number of vaccinations performed there during the last three years fell by 6,734 in comparison with the number performed in the previous period. Captain Brown, the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Bihar Circle,
2 inspected vaccination work in some of the villages of this district in the neighbourhood of Bankipore in November 1913, and reported that he found a large proportion of the children under six years of age to be unvaccinated. Other information which has been obtained about the state of vaccination in this area shows that the villagers are assuming an active opposition to the operation, and that conditions are springing up which will be a source of danger in future years to the inhabitants of the Capital unless they are dealt with and it is possible that the compulsory Vaccination Act may have to be introduced. In the Gaya and Shahabad districts also vaccination work is not satis- factory. The rate of mortality from small-pox in the Gaya district for the last five years (.62) is higher than that of any other district in the Province except Patna and the number of operations has decreased by 15,414. In Shahabad also there was a decrease of 5,323. In both the Gaya and Shaha- bad districts the Civil Surgeons report great difficulty in getting the higher castes, especially the Rajputs, to accept vaccination and in Shahabad the difficulty is increased by having to employ as Vaccinators men of the Mali caste who in this district are said to be particularly dirty and incompetent, and it seems that no men of a better class can be found to replace them at present. Tirhut Division. Judging by the increase in the number of operations reported and by the low rate of mortality from small-pox during the last five years (.12), vacci- nation in the districts of the Tirhut Division appears on the whole to have made progress. In Saran, the number of operations increased by 11,342, and this increase occurred in spite of the heavy annual mortality from plague. In Muzaffarpur, an increase of 2,859 is reported and in Darbhanga 24,818. On the other hand, in Champaran the number of vaccinations performed during the last three years fell short of the number performed in the previous period by 3,200, but the Civil Surgeon reports that the work improved very much during the last year and that the staff performed 7,766 operations in excess of the number recorded in 1912-13. Bhagalpur Division. The rate of mortality from small-pox in all the districts of the Bhagal- pur Division is rather high (.24) and is due to the persistence of the disease in certain areas which include the diaras of the Ganges and Kosi, in which it seems difficult to get the people vaccinated. In Monghyr an increase of 18,000 operations is recorded which is said to have been due to &quot;the unflinching exertions on the part of the Vaccinators and to the strict supervisions exercised by the Inspecting staff.&quot; In Bhagal- pur, though there was on the whole an increase of 5,515 operations over the record of the previous period, vaccination work during the last year has suffered very severely, especially in Bhagalpur town and the Sadr sub- division, from the presence of plague and cholera and by high floods in the Kosi river. In the Santal Parganas a heavy fall of 13,618 operations is reported. The Civil Surgoon has not given any explanation of the defect. Orissa Divisino. The ratio of mortality from small-pox in this Division (.16) for the last five years is not high and vaccination work on the whole seems to be making fair progress. The number of operations in Cuttack and Balasore have increased during the last three years by 31,000 and 63,000, respectively, while in Puri and in Sambalpur the number has decreased. In Puri the fall was over 11,000 and the Civil Surgeon reports that vaccination in the Khurda subdivision is unsatisfactory. Vaccination in Sambalpur is carried on with
3 vaccine taken from calves which are vaccinated by the Vaccinators in the villages according to the system which is in force in the Central Provinces. The system is well suited to the habits of the people and the results appear to be satisfactory. Glycerinated vaccine made in the Central Depôt which is preferable in many ways to that prepared by the local Vaccinators will be gradually introduced. Chota Nagpur Division. The rate of mortality from small-pox in this Division during the last five years was .27. In each of the five districts the number of operations perform- ed during the last three years has decreased in comparison with that of the previous period. The decrease was most marked in Palamau (4 The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner reported the percentage of success to be 94.48 in primary operations and 12.85 in re-vaccinations and the Inspectors reported it to be 97.59 in primary operations and 70.99 in re- vaccinations. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner's inspections during the last two years have had to be confined to a large extent to operations in compulsory areas owing to the pressure of other sanitary work. 6. VACCINATION IN COMPULSORY AREAS. Bengal Act V of 1880 which provides for compulsory vaccination in Municipal towns was extended to the Forbesganj Municipality in the Purnea. district and to the Civil Station of Doranda in the Ranchi district in 1913 ; and it is now in force throughout the Province except in Sambalpur in which the Central Provinces Municipal Act is in force. Statement VII shows that during the year 1913-14 out of 30,344 children under one year of age available for vaccination 23,578 or 77.70 per cent. were successfully vaccinated. The number of successful vaccinations as compared with the number of children available varies very considerably in different areas. On the one hand, in Patna, Gaya and Darbhanga, three of the most important towns in the Province, only about half the children available appear to have been vaccinated and in the town of Bhagalpur the proportion is as low as one-fifth. On the other hand, in Muzaffarpur, Bettiah and Monghyr more children were vaccinated than were recorded as being available. In the absence of any information to show the basis on which the calculations have been made it is impossible to criticise these figures to any purpose; but judging from the absence of small-pox generally in Municipal areas, and from the inspection notes on vaccination which the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners make in their municipal reports, I believe that Municipal vaccination is on the whole fairly well performed, though of course there is much room for, improvement. In future Health Officers will be responsible for the supervision of vaccination in the towns to which they have been appointed. 7. COST OF THE DEPARTMENT. The cost of the Department during the. year 1913-14 was Rs. 93,373 of which Rs. 82,241 was paid from the Provincial funds, Rs. 6,383 from Local funds, Rs. 4,557 from Municipal funds and Rs. 192 by Native States. 8. VACCINATION IN THE ORISSA FEUDATORY STATES. For many years past, vaccination has been quietly . developing in the Feudatory States under the direction and encouragement of the Political Officer, though no mention appears to have been made of the work in any of the previous vaccination reports. The following figures which are taken from the administration report of the Feudatory States of Orissa and Chota Nagpur for the year 1912-13 give some idea of the progress which has been made during the last eight years :5 This is a remarkable record, especially as regards the number of the re- vaccinations. An important feature of vaccination work in some of the States is the employment of female Vaccinators to vaccinate the women of the upper classes, and they are said to have proved a great sucess. The example of these States might with advantage be followed by Municipal Bodies through- out the Province; and the attention of the local authorities will be invited to the matter. In some of the States low caste Vaccinators are specially employed for the lower classes, who cannot be vaccinated by the ordinary Vaccinators. Great interest is said to be taken in the spread of vaccination by the Chiefs, and the Political Officer estimates that 52 per cent. of the entire population of the States is protected. Chief among the States in vaccination work is Patna in which 58,193 operations were performed in 1912-13. This State is followed on the list by Keonjhar (56,258), Gangpur (44,719) and Kalahandi (44,130) in the order mentioned. 9. SUPPLY OF VACCINE. Considerable difficulty was experienced in supplying the districts with vaccine during the last two years. The supply of lanolinated vaccine from the Calcutta Depôt with which the Vaccination staff in this Province has hitherto been accustomed to work, proved insufficient, and in the middle of the last season it had to be curtailed still further owing to an outbreak of small-pox in Bengal. It was supplemented partly by glycerinated vaccine from the Patwa Dangar Depôt in the United Provinces and partly by calf vaccine and human vaccine. A Vaccine Depôt for the Province was sanctioned by Government in 1913. The buildings are now under construction at Namkum near Ranchi and it is hoped that they will be sufficiently far advanced in time to enable vaccine to be prepared for the coming season. 10. DEPUTY SANITARY COMMISSIONER'S REPORT. Captain Brown, I.M.S., inspected vaccination work in 5 districts of the Bihar and Chota Nagpur Circles during the cold weather of 1913-14. He reports that the quality of the work varied very much in different districts. In Ranchi, it was uniformly good and almost every child that he saw bore 4 good scars, but in other districts like Patna and Shahabad, it was very poor. Often only one or two scars were to be seen and they were so minute as to be useless for protective purposes. He considers that a great advance will be made when the Vaccine Depôt is opened and when Sub-Inspectors can all be passed through a course of training in vaccination, so that they may be competent to train their Vaccinators properly.

GOVERNMENT OF BIHAR AND ORISSA. MUNICIPAL DEPARTMENT. RESOLUTION. No. 9426M. Ranchi, the 7th September 1914. READ2 filtered water throughout the Jharia field has been administratively approved by Government and a Mines Board of Health has been constituted for the area. It is hoped that these measures will result in a great improvement in the local sanitary conditions and in the public health. His Honour in Council observes with pleasure that the use of permanganate of potash as a preventive measure for disinfecting wells has generally become popular, and he trusts that the use of this single and effective remedy will continue to be encouraged. (ii) Small-pox.3 (iv) Plague.4 to the assignment of the Public Works Cess to the District Boards as well as to the system of distributing the augmentation grants. Another Conference was held at Bankipore under the Chairmanship of the Sanitary Commissioner to discuss questions relating to school hygiene. The report of this Committee is under consideration by Government. An influential Committee, presided over by the Sanitary Commissioner with the Government of India, visited the chief centres of pilgrimage in the Province in July last year to inspect and advise on their sanitation. Unfortunately their report has been much delayed and its non-receipt has involved the postponement of a number of schemes in course of execution or in contemplation by the Local Government. In view of the large concourse of pilgrims which visits Puri every year and of the out- breaks of sickness which are at present an annual occurrence and a source of danger not only to Bihar and Orissa but to India as a whole, it is hoped that it may be possible to place the Lieutenant-Governor in Council in a position to deal with this very important matter. 9.

No. 3641. FROM LIEUTENANT-COLONEL E. C. HARE, I.M.S., SANITARY COMMISSIONER, BIHAR AND ORISSA, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BIHAR AND ORISSA, MUNICIPAL DEPARTMENT. Dated Ranchi, the 10th June 1913. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit the Annual Vaccination Return of this Province for the year 1912-13. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient Servant, E. C. HARE, LIEUT.-COLONEL, I.M.S., Sanitary Commissioner, Bihar and Orissa.
NOTE ON VACCINATION FOR THE YEAR 1912-13. 1. Vaccination is carried on under the local authorities by licensed and paid vaccinators and their work is supervised by the Government staff of Inspectors. 12,93,474 persons were vaccinated, which gives an average of 1,140 to each vaccinator. Of these 25,405 were revaccinated. The percentage of successful primary operations is reported to be 99.59 and of revaccinations 69.33. The number of operations fell by 19,776 in comparison with the record of 1911-12. The fall was most noticeable in Cuttack (18,212), Champran (4,914) and Monghyr (4,191). In the two latter places it is attributed to cholera and plague. 2. Statement VI shows the ratio of mortality from small-pox side by side with the number of successful vaccinations during the last decade. It will be noticed that between the year 1904-05 and 1908-09 the death rate steadily rose from .19 to .83 per mille and that during the first three years of this period the number of successful vaccinations was remarkably low. It will also be noticed that since 1908-09, when the ratio of mortality reached its height, it has steadily fallen year by year, in proportion as the number of successful operations has increased. At the present time the ratio of mortality (.06) is lower and the number of successful vaccinations is higher than it has been at any time during last decade. This relationship between the figures seems to be too regular to be merely a coincidence, and I think that very probably the successful result is due to the efforts which the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners and vaccination staff in Bengal have been making of recent years to improve vaccination in rural areas. The number of successful operations has, however, fallen during the year under report by over 18,000 ; which shows that further efforts must be made if the high standard of efficiency of rural vaccination is to be maintained. Apart from the Native Tributary States, from which no vital occurrences are reported, the mortality from small-pox in most of the districts of the province is negligible and the only extensive area which reports a high death rate includes parts of the districts of Purnea, Bhagalpur, Monghyr and the Sonthal Parganas in the North-East part of the Province. 3. The attention which has been paid to vaccination in rural areas does not seem to have been extended to Municipal areas. A reference to Statement VII shows that the proportion of children successfully vaccinated was in many cases very low compared with the number who were available for vaccination. In the towns of Gaya, Bihar, Dinapur, Chapra, Darbhanga, Monghyr, Jamalpur, Bhagalpur, Cuttack and Hazaribagh the records show that of a total of 11,814 available children only 6,316 or a little over a half were vaccinated. This condition is not at all satisfactory and unless special efforts are made to get the children vaccinated serious outbreaks of small-pox will occur in these towns sooner or later. If the provisions of the Bengal Vacci- nation Act are properly carried out practically every child born within Municipal limits if it lives, should have been vaccinated by the time it reaches one year of age. Lanolinated vaccine was supplied to all districts from the Calcutta Depôt by an arrangement with the Sanitary Commissioner of Bengal. It was of good quality and the work done with it is reported to have been very satisfactory. The plans and estimates of a Vaccine Depôt for the Province of Bihar and Orissa costing Rs. 1,44,000 have been sanctioned and the building is to be put in hand immediately. E. C. HARE, LIEUT.- COLONEL, I.M.S., Sanitary Commissioner, Bihar and Orissa.

ANNUAL STATISTICAL RETURNS AND SHORT NOTES ON VACCINATION IN BIHAR AND ORISSA, for the year 1914-15. 1. INTRODUCTORY. Lt.-Col. E. C. HARE, I.M.S., was in charge of the Department throughout the year. The office of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Bihar Circle, was held by Major Brown, I.M.S., from 1st April to 7th September 1914, Major W. C. Ross, from 8th September to 24th October 1914, and myself from 24th October to 31st March 1915. The office of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Chota Nagpur Circle, was held by Dr. Sebastian throughout the year. He was also in charge of the Orissa Circle till 14th March 1915 when Dr. B. P. Mazumdar was appointed temporarily as Deputy Sanitary Commissioner of the Orissa Circle. 2. VACCINATION STAFF. One hundred and forty-two paid and 999 Licensed Vaccinators and 20 Inspec- tors and 63 Sub-Inspectors were employed throughout the year. In addition to this three Sub-Inspectors were employed as Loaders in the Vaccine Depôt. Their services are transferrable with the district staff. In Municipal towns and in the districts of Puri and Sambalpur vaccina- tion was carried on by paid vaccinators. In other cases the work was done by licensed vaccinators as a rule except in a few cases where some paid vaccinators were employed by District Boards. 3. GENERAL OPERATIONS. The total number of operations performed by all agencies amounted to 1,314,042 against 1,323,948 of the previous year. Of the total operations 1,295,179 were performed by the vaccination department as compared with 1,299,788 of the last year; 1,242,316 were primary and 52,863 revaccinations against 1,281,100 primary and 18,688 revaccinations of the last year. The primary vac- cinations fell by 38,784 and revaccinations rose by 34,175. In primary vaccinations the most marked decrease was in the districts of the Santal Parganas (10,173), Cuttack (23,083), Balasore (21,813) and Puri (12,644). There was some decrease in Gaya, Saran, Bhagalpur, Purnea, Angul, and Manbhum districts also. In the Santal Parganas the Civil Surgeon attributes the decrease partly to scarcity of food-grains and prevalence of malaria and partly to inexperience of the subor- dinate inspecting staff. In Cuttack the Civil Surgeon attributes decrease to irregular supply of vaccine, the prevalence of cholera and unsatisfactory work of some vaccinators. In Balasore scarcity of food grain and inability to pay fees is reported to be the cause of the fall. The Civil Surgeon of Puri reports the decrease to be due to an irregular and insufficient supply of vaccine.
2 The increase in the revaccination was due to greater attention being paid to revaccination on account of outbreak of small-pox in several districts, In Manbhum generally and especially the Jherria Coal Field the people willingly accepted revaccination though they were strongly opposed to it during the previous years. The total number of revaccinations was 16,539 in this district. Of the total operations (1,295,179) 1,270,949 or 98.12 per cent. proved successful as compared with 1,284,609 or 98.9 per cent. of the last year. The percentage of success in primary and revaccinations in which the results were known was 99.69 and 73.51 respectively against 99.67 and 75.41 of the previous year. There was an increase of 7,048 over that of the last year in the operations performed in municipalities. The ratio of success in municipalities was 98.17 for primary and 53.90 for revaccination as compared with 99.48 for primary, 69.62 for revaccination in rural areas. 4. VACCINATION IN COMPULSORY AREAS. In the towns in which the Vaccination Act is in force 82.41 per cent. of the total number of children under one year of age were successfully vaccinated as compared with 77.70 per cent. of the previous year. In the towns of Arrah, Muzaffarpur, Cuttack, Ranchi, Lohardaga, Palamau, Purulia, Kishanganj, Rajmahal, and Jhalda the number of successful operations was in excess of that of the children available. It is reported that people from the adjoining villages bring their children to be vaccinated in the municipal area to avoid payment of fees. 5. MORTALITY FROM SMALL-POX. The provincial rate of mortality from small-pox was .22 against .11 per 1,000 in the previous year. The following districts had a higher mortality than that prevailing in the province generally :3 The subordinate Inspecting Staff inspected 35.90 per cent. of the total operations as compared with 36.62 of the previous year. The District Inspectors of Patna, Saran, Champaran and Angul districts inspected more than 42 per cent. of the primary operations in their respective charges, while in 10 districts Sub-Inspectors of Vaccination inspected more than 50 per cent. of the total operations in primary cases. The Health Officer of Muzaffarpur inspected 849 primary and 33 revac- cination cases, respectively, and the Health Officer, Bhagalpur, 477 primary cases. Health Officers of municipalities have been made inspecting officers in the municipal areas. The percentage of success reported by the vaccinators was 99.27 per cent. in the primary and 64.82 in revaccination cases, whereas that recorded by the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners and the Civil Surgeons was as given below:4 Act V of 1880 was extended to the Tata Iron Factory at Sakchi in the district of Singhbhum. Owing to the redistribution of duties occasioned by the War, the services of no Deputy Sanitary Commissioner were available for the inspection of vaccination. S. N. TIWARY, Offg.

ANNUAL VACCINATION REPORT BIHAR AND ORISSA. 1915-16. 1. Staff.2 The Tirhut Division shows small decreases in all the districts except Champaran which returns a slight increase. The Bhagalpur Division shows a large decrease in the Purnea district (8769) and small decreases in the Bhagalpur and Monghyr districts and a rise of 4594 in the return from the Santal Parganas. The Chota Nagpur Division returns show small increases in the districts of Ranchi and Palamau and large decreases in the districts of Manbhum and Singhbhum amounting to 16352 and 6416, respectively. Hazaribagh district shows a small decrease of 1782. 4. Vaccination in towns and compulsory areas.3 generally enforced, that vaccination should be free and that the vaccination staff in all the districts should be put on one consolidated provincial cadre for purposes of administration and work. 8. Inspection of work.4 Sales of vaccine, calves, etc., resulted in the receipt of Rs. 4,637-2-3 and Rs. 4,964-9-8 are still owing for vaccine supplied during the year. The average cost per dose fell from 4.8 pies to 2.1 pies or to 1.8 pies if the actual receipts for sales are taken into account. A further reduction in the average cost per dose may be expected next year, but even now it compares most favourably with the cost of production in other Depôts in India. The services of the Superintendent (on probation) were dispensed with in October 1915, and a new Superintendent, Dr. C. N. Banarji, was appointed in November 1915, who has proved to be a capable and careful officer and has worked very satisfactorily. The arrangements for the supply of calves were altered and the supply is now ample and regular from three contractors. Two epidemics of foot and mouth disease broke out during the year, and the Depôt was closed temporarily on both occasions. The contract for the supervision of the refrigerating plant has been stopped and further economies in the reduction of the staff and the cost of packing are contemplated. During the year the diet of the calves was consi- derably increased, but the extra cost is more than repaid by the larger and better return of vaccine and by the saving of time in convalescence. The issue of vaccine direct to vaccinators instead of to Civil Surgeons for redistribution, was begun during the year and will be continued. The primary cost to the Depôt is greater, but the ultimate cost is less and the saving of time is a matter of importance with glycerinated vaccine. I propose to use collapsible tin tubes in place of glass capillary tubes next year and have arranged for a supply. The glass tubes are expensive and trouble some to load, and they break in transit. I also propose to manufacture some lanolinated vaccine next year as an experiment owing to the complaints received that glycerinated vaccine does not stand long hot journeys very well. The great increase in output and the reorganisation of the entire system of working gave both Dr. Sebastian and Dr. Banarji a large amount of hard work, which was well and carefully done. These officers deserve great credit for the success of their efforts, and I have only to add that the work of the Depôt is now proceeding economically and smoothly and without fear of interruption. 10.

TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION, BIHAR AND ORISSA, FOR THE YEARS 1914-45, 1915-16 & 1916-17. 1. Staff.2 The total numbers of operations performed during the last three years have been as follows :3 with less opposition than in any other Division of the Province and is carried out more thoroughly. Bhagalpur Division. The Bhagalpur Division shows the worst record of the three Divisions ofBihar. In all the four districts there has been a serious decrease in the number of operations performed, the falling off amounting to 33,387 operations in the Santal Parganas, 17,382 in Monghyr, 16,971 in Bhagalpur, and 7,320 in Purnea during the three years' period. Orissa Division. In the Orissa Division the decrease in the number of operations performedduring the last three years has been large, amounting to 138,464 in Cuttack, 78,310 in Balasore, 51,679 in Puri, and 11,617 in Sambalpur. In Angul alone has there been an increase amounting to 6,728. I have reason to believe that the returns from the Orissa Districts from 1909 up to 1911 were largely ficti- tious. A special campaign was being pressed during these years by the Sani- tary Commissioner, Bengal, and the returns went up by leaps and bounds to figures which showed a vaccination ratio very largely in excess of the birth- rates. Whilst I do not consider that there has been an actual decrease in the work to any thing like the extent which would appear from the figures quoted, nevertheless I am dissatisfied with the work of the Vaccination Department in Orissa and I have taken action against the Inspecting Officers who are chiefly responsible for bad work. Chota Nagpur Division. In four out of the five districts (Palamau being the exception) there weresmall decreases in the number of opera- tions performed, amounting to 7,020 in Ranchi and 6,177 in Hazaribagh and to smaller numbers in other districts. Act II of 1911 and Act V of 1880 were enforced at Sakchi and in the Mining Settlement area at Jharia during the period under review and there has been no difficulty in getting the work of compulsory vaccination efficiently carried out. General. In the Orissa and Bhagalpur Divisions there has been a serious decrease in the amount of work and departmental action has already been taken to dealwith the staff. In the other three Divi- sions of Patna, Tirhut and Chota Nagpur, the results have been fairly satisfactory during the last three years. In my opinion it is probable that the recently introduced methods of checking vacci- nators' work and returns in absolute detail have had a considerable influence in reducing the numbers of reported operations. But there is no doubt but that there is still scope for a considerable increase in the amount of work actually done and I accordingly arranged to increase the number of vaccinators in the Province in September 1916, and to supply a larger quantity of vaccine than had been issued in the previous years. If necessary, I propose to extend those measures further and I anticipate that some results should become apparent by next year. 4. Vaccination in towns and compulsory areas.4 The following tabulated statement shows the results for the last 12 years:5 Patna Division. The Patna Division has always been a hot bed of small-pox, second onlyto the Orissa Division in the prevalence of the disease. During the last two years efforts have been made to extend and improve vaccination work in the Patna Division and during the last year of the period under report there has been a decrease in the death-rate from small-pox in the Patna Division amounting to over 50 per cent. Tirhut Division. In the Tirhut Division the death-rate from small-pox has always beenlow and there is no doubt but that this Division is the best vaccinated Division in the Province. Bhagalpur Division. In the Bhagalpur Division the mortality has always been higher thanin Tirhut but has never recently exceeded the mortality in the Patna Division. Orissa Division. The Orissa Division has the unenviable position of returning the highestdeath-rate from small-pox and is headed by the Sambalpur District with a death- rate of 1.09 last year which is almost double the death-rate in Puri District (.52) and Cuttack (.46) which are the districts with the next highest death- rates in the Province. Chota Nagpur Division. In Chota Nagpur small-pox is not very prevalent and this Division shareswith Tirhut the reputation of being well vaccinated and having a low small-pox mortality. 8. Prevention of Small-pox.6 It should be noted that the methods of inspection of Civil Surgeons and Deputy Sanitary Commissioners are different. Civil Surgeons inspect the new work which has just been done and the numbers returned by them are therefore smaller, whereas Deputy Sanitary Commissioners inspect all the children under ten years of age and look at old work as well as new work and also look for unvaccinated children and children who are marked with small-pox. 10. The Officers of the Inspecting Staff.7 In the first year under report the work had just begun and many difficulties were encountered. In 1915-16 the work and management were reorganized and the output was greatly increased. In 1916-17 the output required was not so great as a reserve stock had been established, and it was found advisable to close the Depôt in May and June as the vaccine previously made in these hot months had been deficient in quantity and defective in quality. Unfortunately during this year there was a loss of 679,000 doses owing to a failure of the cold storage plant and it was only by working at very full pressure during the cold weather that the reserve stock could be maintain- ed. The defect in the quality of the vaccine was first reported when it was issued at the beginning of the working season and before the vaccine could be tested a considerable number of doses had issued and resulted in a large number of &quot; failed &quot; operations at the beginning of the season. All vaccine is now tested both at the time of manufacture and at the time of issue and as a precautionary measure the dilution with glycerine has been decreased from 1 in 6 to 1 in 5. This decrease in dilution combined with the increased cost of all stores and materials owing to the war has prevented a much greater diminution in the cost of production. Nevertheless in spite of these disadvantageous circumstances the working costs of this Depôt are now very low as compared with any other Depôt in India and the vaccine now issued is giving very satisfactory results. During the last year under report arrangements have been made to issue lanolinated vaccine to the Orissa Feudatory States at the request of the Politi- cal Agent. The dilution is less and the cost to the Depôt is greater but it appears to stand long journeys better and gives general satisfaction. Epidemics of foot and mouth disease have stopped the work of the Depôt four times in the three years, but the loss of time has been made up and the output of vaccine has been ample. The chief loss through these epidemics arises from the loss of calves and of vaccine in the making as the sick calves have to be discarded. This loss, together with the loss of calves from accidents and other causes, greatly diminishes the apparent output per calf which has really been greatly increased by improved feeding and technique and is actually over 3,000 doses per calf kept and used. The system of direct fortnightly issues to vaccinators has been continued. The cost to the Depôt is greater as the number of postal packages is large but the results are good. There is no loss of time or of the freshness of the vaccine and there is really a saving owing to the packages being posted only once instead of issuing to Civil Surgeons and being reposted by them. The staff of the Depôt has worked well during the last year and special credit is due to Dr. T. Sebastian and Dr. C. N. Banarji for their good work. 12. Experimental work.8 glycerine vaccine at present issued in capillary tubes. Collapsible tin tubes are desirable but a less fluid preparation is required for issue in them. 13.

[Maximum limit 5 pages]. ANNUAL VACCINATION REPORT BIHAR AND ORISSA for the year 1917-18. 1. Staff.2 (6,259), Patna (364), and Shahabad (267). In view of the disastrous floods, the serious epidemics of cholera and plague, and the disturbances caused by riots in this division during the year, these results are very satisfactory. Tirhut Division. In the two districts of Saran and Champaran the number of operations wasslightly increased, but small decreases were recorded in the districts of Muzaffar-pur and Darbhanga. As a whole, the work in the Tirhut Division is in asatisfactory state. Bhagalpur Division. The Bhagalpur Division shows an increase of 6,659 operations this year,as compared with the large decrease report- ed last year. The Santal Parganas show an increase of 9,520 and Monghyr of 1,120 whilst Bhagalpur and Purnea dis- tricts return decreases of 3,462 and 519 respectively. Orissa Division. The Orissa Division on the other hand shows a very large decrease andthe Cuttack district again heads the list with another large drop of 10,922 in the number of operations performed. The district of Angul also returns a decrease of 4,043 whilst the other districts, viz., Balasore, Puri and Sambalpur show increases of 2,681, 5,527 and 2,809 respectively. Chota Nagpur Division. The Chota Nagpur Division returns show small increases in the districtsof Ranchi, Manbhum, Palamau and Singh- bhum and a decrease in the district of Hazaribagh. The decrease in Hazaribaghwas due to the wide-spread prevalence of cholera and to the difficulty of gettingthe staff started to work before December. 4. Vaccination in towns and compulsory areas.3 The figures above quoted speak for themselves and are a very satisfactory record of the work done to stamp out and prevent small-pox in these States. Both vaccination and to a large extent revaccination are practically compulsory in the majority of these States; and both the record and the results of the work are eminently satisfactory. 6. Protection of Infants.4 210,920 in the previous year. The decrease in the number of operations inpsected is due to the more detailed and systematic manner in which the work is now inspected and checked, by comparing inspecting officers' diaries and reports and examining vaccinators' registers in the villages and verifying a number of the entries. The inspecting work done during the year by the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners has been very comprehensive, and they have submit- ted valuable reports on the efficiency of the staff and the arrangements in twenty of the twenty-one districts in the province. Action has been taken on these reports in each case. The Civil Surgeons of the province have inspected during the year 65,694 primary and 6,385 revaccination operations against 67,096 primary operations and 6,263 revaccinations last year. It should be noted that the methods of inspection, of Civil Surgeons and Deputy Sanitary Commissioners are different. Civil Surgeons inspect the new work which has just been done and the numbers returned by them are therefore smaller, whereas Deputy Sanitary Commis- sioners, inspect all the children under ten years of age, and look at old work as well as new work, and also look for unvaccinated children and children who are marked with small-pox, and they also examine vaccinators' registers and other records in the villages where they can be verified and checked. 10. The officers of the Inspecting staff.5 The following tabulated statement shows the numbers of calves purchased or hired, the numbers of doses manufactured, the average numbers of doses yielded per calf, the total gross cost and the total revenue and the average net cost per dose for four years :6 also makes the vaccine rapidly inert: this experiment demonstrates the necessity for the prolonged storage of vaccine at a low temperature before it is issued or used. Another experiment proved that exposure to bright sun light causes rapid deterioration of the vaccine, and justifies the change of packing, from capillary glass tubes to collapsible metal tubes for that reason as well as for the greater convenience. The feeding experiments, which were carried out during the year, definitely proved that a 50 % increase in the calf's ration produced nearly a 50 % in- crease in the vaccine production, but a further increase gave bad results owing to the indigestion and diarrhoea caused by over-feeding. The rations have therefore been standardized at the 50% increase with very satisfactory results. Further experiments were also carried out in the manufacture and packing of the vaccine with a view to getting a better product which would keep better and would be easier to pack and handle. Some improvements have already been introduced but final results have not yet been obtained in this direction. 13. Cost of the Department.STATEMENTS.

TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION BIHAR AND ORISSA FOR THE YEARS 1917-18, 1918-19 & 1919-20. 1. Staff.2 The total number of operations performed during the last three years has been as follows :3 Orissa Division. The Orissa Division shows the worst record of the five divisions of the province. The decrease in the average number of operations performed during the last three years was 62,965. The decrease was shared by all the districts with the exception of the district of Puri which recorded a rise in the average number of operations by 237. The rise in this district was marked in the year 1917-18. The highest fall occurred in the district of Cuttack (36,742) followed by Balasore (17,154), Sambalpur (6,568) and Angul (2,738). Chota Nagpur Division. In the five districts of this division there were decreases in the average number of operations performed during the triennial period under report, amount- ing to 8,892 in Manbhum, 8,108 in Hazaribagh, 7,069 in Ranchi, 6,950 in Palamau and 2,757 in Singhbhum. In 1918-19 influenza was epidemic during the vaccination season and large percentage of vaccinators could not do much work for about three months in the season. 4. Vaccination in Towns and Compulsory Areas.4 Orissa Division. The mortality from small-pox in this division was highest in the Province The district of Puri recorded a rate of 3.12 per mille. Chota Nagpur Division. Of the five districts of Chota Nagpur division, the districts of Palamau (1.26) and Singhbhum (1.24) recorded the highest rates of mortality from small-pox, followed by Ranchi (.90). The high rate of mortality from small-pox during 1919-20 was due partly to the fewer vaccinations done in 1918-19 and partly to the greater prevalence of small-pox in the province during the last year. Small-pox appears to have been generally prevalent in the country during 1919-20, as mortality from it was also higher in the adjoining provinces of Central Provinces, Bengal and United Provinces. 8. Prevention of Small-pox.5 The inspection of vaccination continues to be unsatisfactory. It is however, consolatory to remember that proposals for the creation of a Public Health Service6 The Vaccine Depôt continued to do very useful work and is now paying its own cost. Br. T. Sebastian, the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Ghota Nagpur and Orissa Circle, who is in supervising charge of the Dep6t and Dr. C. N. Banarji, the Superintendent of Dep6t, deserve commendation for its efficient management. S. N. TIWARI, Offg. Sanitary Commissioner, Bihar and Orissa. B. & O. G. P.(Sanitary.) No. 3-880-17-8-1920.-H.

ANNUAL VACCINATION REPORT BIHAR AND ORISSA FOR THE YEAR 1920-21. 1. Staff.2 The ratios of success in Municipalities were 95.09 per cent. for primary operations and 48.98 per cent. for revaccinations as compared with 96.24 per cent. and 51.15 per cent. respectively last year. The number of operations performed in rural areas was 997,578 as compared with 963,543 last year and the ratios of successes were 99.15 per cent. for primary operations and 62.23 for revaccinations. Patna Division. 3. Vaccination in Districts.3 per thousand, the total number of operations performed is still in excess of the total number of infants available, as it always has been. In previous years the excess has been very marked, and as there has been a constant excess it must be inferred that the returns are to that extent on the average fictitious. Civil Surgeons and Deputy Sanitary Commissioners are unanimous in attributing the opposition to vaccination to be concerned more with the age of the child than with the operation itself, and, in view of the strong popular prejudice which exists against the vaccination of infants at an early age, I consider that it is desirable that the Vaccination Act should be amended so as to raise the age for compulsory vaccination to one year instead of six months. 7. Incidence and Mortality of Small-pox.4 office with only three Deputy Sanitary Commissioners to carry on the work, and it is only possible to attain a moderate degree of efficiency by strict enforcement of the departmental rules and regulations and standing orders. 11. Supply of Vaccine.5 The cost per successful operation was 2 anna 5 pies against 1 anna 10 pies in the previous year. The increase in rate is due to the increased rate of pay. 15.

ANNUAL VACCINATION REPORT BIHAR AND ORISSA FOR THE YEAR 1921-1922. 1. Staff.2 Patna Division. 3. Vaccination in Districts.3 at an early age. I consider that it is desirable that the Vaccination Act should be amended so as to raise the age for compulsory vaccination to one year instead of six months. 7. Incidence and Mortality of Small-pox.4 11. Vaccine Depôt and Cold Storage. 5 In my opinion a change in system is now called for to meet the changed conditions and I very strongly recommend a change of policy from the licensing system to a system of free and compulsory vaccination and a change of control with decentralisation from the Vaccination Department to the District Boards. I have for many years advised the introduction of free and compulsory vaccination and I am convinced that it is more necessary now than ever before if the Province is to be saved from lapsing into a partially unvaccinated condition which will surely end in a great epidemic of small-pox. In conclusion I desire to bring to the notice of Government the work of the three Assistant Directors of Public Health and especially of Dr. T. Sebastian whose work has been characterised by reliability and sound judgment. Dr. C. N. Banerji has carried out his duties as Superintendent of the Vaccine Depôt with efficiency and in a very satisfactory manner. W. C. ROSS, LT.-COL. I.M.S., Director of Public Health, Bihar and Orissa.

TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION BIHAR AND ORISSA FOR, THE YEARS 1920-21, 1921-22 and 1922-23. Staff.2 Of the total number of operations performed, the majority have been primary as shown in the following statement:3 4.Vaccination in Towns and Compulsory Areas.4 infants at an early age, I consider that it is desirable that the Vaccination Act should be amended so as to raise the age for compulsory vaccination to one year instead of six months. I do not consider that small-pox can be effectively dealt with and stamped out unless vaccination is made compulsory throughout the Province, and I would recommend that the Vaccination Act should be modified so as to extend the age within which vaccination is required, to one year, and should be generally enforced, that vaccination should be free; and that the supervision and control of vaccination should be delegated to District Boards and Municipalities and their Health Officers. 9.

Vaccination in Towns and Compulsory areas.3 slightly irregular periodic variation in the epidemic prevalence of small-pox and it is probable that we have just passed through the period of least preva- lence, and are entering upon a period of increasing epidemic prevalence; I consider it likely that the prevalence of small-pox will increase materially during the next two or three years and that there is likely to be a severe- epidemic of small-pox in the province in 1926 or 1927. The provincial ratios of the mortality from small-pox per thousand of population during the last five years have been .53, .56, .14, .07 and .11. 8. Prevention of small-pox.4 vaccine. Three new isolation sheds and a dipping trough have been construc- ted during the year and the grazing ground of the vaccine depôt has been fenced with wire-fencing and sub-divided into paddocks so as to allow of the effective segregation of different batches of cattle and of sick animals. The cold storage, which is essential for the preservation and ripening of the large stocks of vaccine, had been working badly for some time and broke down in October. In November a new compressor was started, but the old oil engine is now giving trouble and it is necessary that a new duplicate engine should be installed. Throughout the year, cholera vaccine and influenza vaccine were stocked in the depôt and issued throughout the Province as required. 12. Experimental Work.STATEMENT I.

Staff.2 Of the total number of operations performed the majority have been. primary as shown in the following statement:3 Chota Nagpur Division. In the five districts of Chota Nagpur, there were increases in the averagenumber of operations performed during the triennial period under report, amounting to45,461. In Manbhum, 16,833, Ranchi, 12,394, Hazaribagh, 8,653, Singhbhum,5,223 and Palamau, 2,358. 4. Vaccination in Towns and compulsory areas.4 Chota Nagpur Division. The rate of mortality from small-pox in the Chota Nagpur Division (0.32)was lower than that of the other divisions of the province excepting only the Bhagal- pur division. Of the five districts of this division, the district of Singhbhum recorded the highest rate (0.52). The lowest rate was recorded in Palamau District (0.06) followed by Manbhum (0.32), Hazaribagh and Ranchi districts (0.34). 8. Prevention of Small-pox.5 The inspecting work done by the Assistant Directors of Public Health has been comprehensive and they have submitted valuable reports on the efficiency of the staff and work in 20 out of the 21 districts in the province. The Civil Surgeons of the province inspected 25,046 primary and 5,684 re-vaccination operations against 22,638 primary and 3,510 re-vaccination last year. It should be noted that the methods of inspection of Civil Surgeons and Assistant Directors of Public Health are different. Civil Surgeons inspect the new work which has just been done and the numbers returned by them are therefore smaller, whereas Assistant Directors of Public Health inspect all the children under ten years of age, and look at old work as well as new work and also look for unvaccinated children and children who are marked with small-pox, and they also examine vaccinators' registers and other records in the villages where they can be verified and checked. 10. Supply of Vaccine.6 Experiments were also carried out to ascertain the cause of loss of potency in the vaccine, and it was established that this loss was invariably associated with the development of an acid reaction in the vaccine. This reaction was developed most quickly in vaccine produced from adult animals, and as a result of this experiment adult animals are no longer used in the production of vaccine lymph. During the year 1925-26, several experiments were carried out in the rejuvenation of seed vaccine. (1) Naguchis method of passage through rabbits' testicles. This method was found to be effective but the quantity available was limited and no very extensive trial of this method was made. (2) Rejuvenation by passage through different species of vaccinifers namely :STATEMENT I.

[PricePRICED PUBLICATIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT OF BIHAR AND ORISSA CAN BE HAD FROMANNUAL VACCINATION REPORT BIHAR AND ORISSA. FOR THE YEAR 1926-27. 1. Staff.2 opinion the increase in the number of vaccinations done in 1926 is largely due to fear of infection in a year when small-pox prevailed in epidemic form in all districts of the province. Of the total number of operations performed 1,332,312 were done by the staff of the vaccination department as compared with 1,277,814 done last year. 1,130,934 operations were primary and 201,378 were re-vaccinations against 1,084,230 primary operations and 193,584 re-vaccinations done last year. There was an increase of 46,704 in the number of primary operations and 7,794 in the number of re-vaccinations during the year. Of the total operations performed (1,332,312), 1,239,476 equal to 93.03 per cent. were successful as compared with 1,191,042 equal to 93.21 last year. The number of operations performed in municipalities decreased by 21,075 as compared with last year's returns. The total number of opera- tions performed was 72,587 and the number of successful operations was 50,762, of which 34,780 were primary and 15,982 were re-vaccinations as compared with 39,370 and 26,036, respectively, last year. The ratios of success in municipalities were 96.41 per cent. for primary operations and 43.77 per cent. for re-vaccinations as compared with 97.64 per cent. and 48.80 per cent., respectively, last year. The number of operations performed in rural areas was 1,259,725 as compared with 1,184,152 last year and the ratios of successes were 99.49 per cent. for primary operations and 60.33 for re-vaccinations. Patna division. 3. Vaccination in districts.3 During the year under report 177,286 primary operations and 294,729 re-vaccinations were performed as compared with 178,698 and 277,553, respectively, in the previous year. 6. Protection of infants.4 solve the difficulty completely. The immunity conferred by vaccination in infancy is by no means lifelong, and if it is seriously desired that small-pox should be eradicated, re-vaccination will also have to be compulsory, until such time as the people themselves come to appreciate the benefits of it. 9. Inspection of work.5 Experiments with regard to maintaining a low temperature in the bamboo reeds in which the vaccine is supplied during the hot weather were carried out with some success. Experiments were also made with a view to destroy- ing extraneous germs in the vaccine without affecting its potencySTATEMENT I.

Priced Publications of the Government of Bihar and Orissa can be had fromAnnual Vaccination Report, Bihar and Orissa, for the year 1927-28. 1. Staff.2 It is difficult to understand the mentality of people who would appear to appreciate the protective value of vaccination when an epidemic of small-pox occurs, but are reluctant to have their children protected when the disease is not so prevalent. This should surely be an argument in favour of compulsory vaccination. Of the total number of operations performed 1,287,943 were done by the staff of the vaccination department as compared with 1,332,312 done last year. 1,086,754 operations were primary and 201,189 were re-vaccinations against 1,130,934 primary operations and 201,378 re-vaccinations done last year. There was a decrease of 44,180 in the number of primary operations and 189 in the number of re-vaccinations during the year. Of the total operations performed (1,287,943), 1,183,071 equal to 93.41 per cent. were successful as compared with 1,239,476 equal to 93.03 last year. The number of operations performed in municipalities decreased by 15,991 as compared with last year's returns. The total number of operation performed was 56,596 and the number of successful operations was 42,269 of which 34,103 were primary and 8,166 were re-vaccinations, as compared with 34,780 and 15,982 respectively, last year. The ratios of success in municipalities were 96.66 per cent. for primary operations and 38.31 per cent. for re-vaccinations as compared with 96.41 per cent. and 43.77 per cent. respectively, last year. The number of operations performed in rural areas was 1,231,347 as compared with 1,259,725 last year and the ratios of successes were 99.36 per cent. for primary operations and 53.40 for re-vaccinations. Patna Division. 3. Vaccination in districts.3 During the year under report 162,182 primary operations and 228,630 re-vaccinations were performed as compared with 177,286 and 294,729 respectively, in the previous year. 6. Protection of infants.4 The inspecting work done by the Assistant Directors of Public Health has been comprehensive and they have submitted valuable reports on the efficiency of the staff and work in all the 21 districts in the province. The Civil Surgeons of the province inspected 30,822 primary and 6,054 re-vaccination operations against 30,934 primary and 7,071 re-vaccinations last year. It should be noted that the methods of inspection of Civil Surgeons and Assistant Directors of Public Health are different. Civil Surgeons inspected the new work which has just been done and the numbers returned by them are therefore smaller, whereas Assistant Directors of Public Health inspect all the children under ten years of age, and look at old work as well as new work, and also look for unvaccinated children and children who are marked with small-pox, and they also examine vaccinators' registers and other records in the villages where they can be verified and checked. 10.
