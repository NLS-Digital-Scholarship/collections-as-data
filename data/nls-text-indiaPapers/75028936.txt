On a parasite found in persons suffering from enlargement of the spleen in IndiaON THE IMPORTANCE OF LARVAL CHARACTERS IN THE CLASSIFICATION OF MOSQUITOES. IN collaboration with Stephens, I described, in a previous publication,1 the ovum and larva of most of the common Anopheles mosquitoes of India. We gave at that time a division of Anopheles into natural groups, largely based upon variations in the immature stages. The groups noted by us, so far as the species investigated were concerned, were practically identical with the genera which Theobald instituted later upon variations in the scale structure of the adult insects; but greater prominence was given to some of these genera, by a consideration of the immature stages, than was apparent from the scale structure of the adults alone. Of the immature stages of mosquitoes other than Anopheles, we unfortunately know very little. The larva of Anopheles and that of Culex were described by Meinert in 1886.1 Howard's2 description of the larva of C. pungens is accurate and detailed. James3 has described and figured the larva of Stegomyia, and was the first to draw attention to the occurrence of cannibal larvæ.4 The larvæ of species of Megarhinus, Toxorhynchites, Desvoidea, Theobaldia, Mela- noconion, Grabhamia, Acartomyia, and Deinocerites have been to some extent described by Theobald,5 who also figures parts of C. fatigans, C. tigripes, and C. mimeticus. In very few of these descriptions, unfortunately, have the points which appear to be of most use in classification been noted. In many cases, indeed, only characters common to nearly all mosquito larvæ have been given. Before proceeding to describe what has been determined regarding the larval characters of a number of genera of culicidæ other than anopheles, it will be well to briefly mention features which appear to be common to all larvæ, and to single out those which, in my researches, I have found to vary in the different genera or species. I. All mosquito larvæ possess a head, an enlarged thorax, and nine abdominal segments. The Head.2 The upper surface is smooth and convex and carries certain hairs, which are usually six in number. Anteriorly the head forms a rather prominent rounded mass (the clypeus). In some cases the clypeus carries small hairs (clypeal hairs) as in Anopheles and Stegomyia. As a rule it carries only two thorn- like spines. When present, the clypeal hairs are of specific importance. The clypeus, instead of projecting, may be concave and form a cup-like hollow (cannibal larvæ). In old larvæ of certain species a sharp beak-like process cov- ered with hairs or spines may project from below the clypeus. At the side of the head are the large compound eyes, and immediately behind these are the ocelli of the simple eyes. The lower surface of the head is smooth and convex and is marked by two grooves which pass from the outer angles of the mental plate backwards. About the middle of the lower surface of the head is a small, dark triangular plate3 of the first and second portions a large series of long stout hairs arises which I have termed the basal tuft. At the junction of the second and third portions there are generally two large and very stout hairs or spines. I have, for descriptive purposes, termed these the median spines. From the end of the third portion, one or more spines project. I have called these terminal spines. There is also, at the extreme end of the antenna, a papilla, which may be large and conspicuous, possibly a sense organ. I have named it the terminal papilla (Pl. II, fig. 16). The antennæ are often very small and poorly developed. In the case of some species (Stegomyia) this appears due to retrograde changes, since most of the above-mentioned structures are represented only by small hairs or spines. The Thorax.4 of view. In a few cases only (certain cannibal larvæ) a conspicuous series of hairs, forming a rudder-like expansion, springs from the median line posteriorly. On the eighth segment there are, on either side, a number of claw-like spines. Several small branched hairs also rise near the base of the siphon tube. Neither the spines nor the hairs appear to be of much importance in relation to classification, since they do not vary to any extent in the genera examined. The characters of the siphon tube are of importance, since this organ is subject to great variations in different genera and even in different species. The relative shortness or tenuity of the organ is an important character. In descriptions of larvæ the terms employed in describing this tube do not allow of accurate information being conveyed. I have therefore employed what I have termed the siphonic index. This is obtained by dividing the length by the greatest breadth of the tube. I have employed an eyepiece micrometer for the purpose of measurement. The figures given by the different genera have been very constant. Stegomyia sugens . . . . 2 ,, fasciata . . . . 1.8 ,, ? . . . . 1.6 Desvoidea . . . . 1.7 Culex fatigans . . . . 4.3 ,, ? . . . . 4.1 ,, impellens . . . . 5 ,, ? . . . . 5 Melanoconion . . . . 7.5 Tæniorhynchus tenax . . . . 13 ,, N. SP. . . . . 13 In describing the siphon tube, it is desirable that a drawing accurately measured should be given, since the siphon tube is subject to the most extraordinary variations in size and shape. In tæniorhynchus it is developed into a long and slender tube. In certain species not yet determined, the siphon tube is enormous. The ninth abdominal segment.5 appear to be of the nature of gills. In the case of a species of Stegomyia, in which these were of very great size, the larvæ habitually remained long periods without rising to the surface. Dorsally, immediately above the anus, four or six long hairs arise from one or two small chitinous plates. Ventrally, a double row of hairs forms a large fan-like expansion. The variations in the hairs of the ninth segment are not great in the different genera and their arrangement is very similar in Anopheles, Stegomyia, and Culex. The Nymph.6 are small in proportion to the length of the body. The whole aspect of the larva is in marked contrast to that of larvæ to which projecting angles and hairs give a spiny look. (Melanoconion, Culex, etc.) The head is smooth, and projecting hairs are inconspicuous. The clypeus forms a prominent boss, on which are situated, in some species, hairs very closely resembling the clypeal hairs of anopheles (Pl. III, figs. 9, 10, 11). The antennæ (Pl. II, figs. 4 and 5), are very distinctive. They are very small and feeble and appear to have undergone degeneration. They are quite smooth and free from the numerous small thorn-like spines which cover the antenna of most other genera. The large hairs of the basal tuft are represented, as in anopheles, by a small branched hair or in some species by a single short bristle only. The median and terminal spines so conspicuous in Culex, Melanoconion, etc., are represented only by several extremely small spike-like processes. As a rule, the terminal papilla (sense organ ?) is well developed and rather conspicuous. On the whole, the antenna of Stegomyia larva approximates most nearly to that of anopheles, but in several points is still more rudimentary than in this sub-family (compare figs. 1 and 5, Pl. II). The mental plate of S. sugens is shown in Pl. III, fig. 1. Those of S. fas- ciata and S. scutellaris are very similar. The siphon tube is very short and stout. The siphonic index is 2 or even slightly less. The spines on the siphon vary in number according to the species. They extend as a rule about two-thirds up the tube. There are mosquitoes, in which the larva has tubes closely resembling those of Stegomyia, which do not appear to belong to the genus; some of these have other features approxi- mating to those of Stegomyia and may be really related to the genus. The anal papillæ are large and well developed. Specific variation.7 and had obtuse ends. In this species the anal papillæ appear to act as func- tional gills, since the larva had a habit of remaining long periods at the bottom. The siphon tube.8 so as to form rafts. The length of the raft is a little greater than the breadth. The micropilar apparatus is "milled" laterally. The larvæ are found especially in domestic utensils, pots, barrels full of water, etc., and are rarely found in large masses of water or in water with much vegetation. The head is, rather large and quadrangular in shape. Some conspicuous branched hairs arise from the dorsum. The clypeus carries two small thorn-like spines, but no structures at all resembling clypeal hairs. The antennæ are fully developed. The basal hairs and the median and terminal spines are long and very noticeable. The first and second portions of the antennæ form a straight line. The third portion is rather small. Small spines are scattered over the first and the proximal part of the second portion (Pl. II, fig. 13). The siphon tube is distinctive; .21 of body length. The siphonic index is 4.3. The spines number 6 or 7 in each row and extend over the lower third of the tube (Pl. II, fig. 24). The nymph of Culex fatigans has respiratory trumpets which project laterally as shown in Pl. I, fig. 9. The opening calls to mind the obliquely-cut mouthpiece of a penny whistle (Pl. I, fig. 7). This character, so far as my researches have gone, appears to be peculiar to the restricted portion of genus Culex we are discussing. Specific variation.9 GROUP III. Adult mosquitoes showing scale arrangement typical of the genus Culex, but having larval characters recalling those of Stegomyia. Four species, all unfortunately undetermined, were noted. All the forms were found in natural pools. Species a.10 I have been able to study the larva which occurs abundantly in the Nilgiris. The larval characters have no relation to any other Culex larvæ. A curious point is that the spines on the siphon tube, which is long and thin, are very large and curved, thus differing from those of the great majority of larvæ which are short, straight spikes. GROUP V. C. concolor.11 The siphon tube is long and very thin; .23 of body length. The siphonic index is 7. There are about 10 spines in each row which are rather long and slender and extend over a little more than the basal third of the tube (Pl. II, fig. 26). The nymph of Melanoconion has distinctive respiratory trumpets. They are peculiarly long and narrow and project in a more distinct curve than do those of Culex. The end is more truncated than in Culex and the opening is on this account more circular (Pl. I, figs. 8 and 10). Tæniorhynchus.12 describes curious quadrangular frontal processes, but these appear to be the widely opened maxillæ. The bodies he describes as antennæ are apparently the maxillary palps. The siphon tube is very short and, from Theobald's drawing, appears very unlike that of other larvæ. Cannibal larvæ.13 evident that the larvæ of these genera are very similar in structure and appear- ance. They all adopt a horizontal attitude. All have specially modified mouth parts and possess conspicuous "clasping organs" in place of the feeding brushes. The general appearance in all is similar; the shape of the head and clypeus is identical. The anal papillæ are rudimentary or absent. Mucidus scataphagoides.14 thorax of the larva of Toxorhynchites and the absence (?) of the spines of the siphon tube in this species. Siphonic index is 2.5 (Pl III, figs. 12 and 19). C. concolor.15 6. Trumpets abruptly truncated (Pl. I, fig. 15) . . . . . Deinocerites. Howardina. Acartomyia. 7. Trumpets contracted at opening; opening circular . . . Mochlonyx. 8. Trumpets contracted at opening; opening slit like . . . Corethra. Two types of antennæ occur in the above descriptions. 1. Stegomyia type figs. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, seen in Stegomyia, Desvoidea, Acartomyia. 2. Culex type figs. 13, 14, 15, 16, seen in Culex, Melanoconion, Tæniorhynchus, Grabhamia. The differences in the two types is so fundamental as to suggest that the siphonate Culicidæ are derived from two main types, one giving rise to the Stegomyiæ, the other to the Culicinæ (restricted sense, see later). The antennæ of C. concolor and Mucidus appear distinct from either, though that of Mucidus approaches more closely to the Stegomyia than the Culex type. The siphon tube is of specific value since it is subject to considerable varia- tion in nearly related species. In many cases the characters of the siphon tube appear also to be of generic significance, i.e., Culex, Stegomyia, Tæniorhynchus, etc. The mental plate is a structure well worth further study. Very distinct characters were present in Stegomyia, Culex, Melanoconion, Tæniorhynchus, C. concolor, and Mudicus. It is evident that, in general, genera based upon the adult characters are established still more firmly by a consideration of the characters of the immature stages. But there are many points brought out very clearly by immature characters which are not so evident on consideration of adult characters alone. Theobald's classification according to adult characters is briefly as follows. (The reasons for the groups are not given. See, however, manual of the Culicidæ.) SUB-FAMILY. Sec. A. 1. Sub-fam. Anophelina . . . . . Anopheles, etc., etc. 2. 16 Sec. A. 4. Sub-fam. Joblotina . . . . . Joblotia. 5. 17 To remove Mucidus and Psorophora from the Culiana and to adopt provisionally a new division including Megarhinus, Toxorhynchites, Mucidus, Psorophora, and possibly Janthinsoma and the genera Lutzia and Jamesia, would seem to be more natural. The larval stages of the Aedeomyina are so little known that I make no attempt to consider the position of this group. In the few species described there are however some features, e.g., the larval antennæ, which suggest a distant relationship to the Stegomyina rather than to the Culicina. The affinities of the Culicidæ would then be shown as follows :18 3. Howard. The Mosquitoes of the United States. Bulletin No. 5. N. S. U. S. Department Agriculture, Division Entomology, 1896. 4.
