No. 7214. Extract from the Proceedings of the Officiating Chief Commissioner, Central Provinces, in the General Department, dated Nagpur, the 25th August 1900. READ2 number shown as available. The explanation given in the case of Khandwa and Burhanpur is that much vaccination was performed among foreigners who flocked into the district under pressure of famine. The same may have been the case in Narsinghpur; and in Raipur there may have been some influx into the town from rural tracts. The reports are silent on the subject. 5. It must be admitted that the measure of success claimed for operations is in most districts probably higher than could be justified by a careful examina- tion of the facts. The Civil Surgeon of Chhindwara, writing on this subject, observes that the percentage of success as given by the Vaccinators ranges from 99 to 100 per cent. This he characterizes as a gross exaggeration, seeing that skilful Vaccinators in England, working under conditions much more favour- able, cannot get more than from 90 to 95 per cent. of successful cases. He attri- butes the high figure of nominal success to the inclusion among successful cases of those in which the result is shown as unknown, and states that a large number of such cases are included. The matter is one which requires watchful control over the staff by the Civil Surgeon. Owing to the demands of famine work on their time Civil Surgeons have had less opportunity than usual for checking the statistics, but it is only in the case of the Chanda District that any marked discre- pancy appears between the results arrived at by Civil Surgeons and those obtained by Native Superintendents. The Civil Surgeon of Seoni, who saw over three and a half thousand cases, states that he was much struck with the very small number of failures which came under his observation: he did not find a single case entered as successful which had not been so. 6. The mortality from small-pox during the year amounted to 3,196. There is practically no correspondence apparent from the statistics between the propor- tion of persons unprotected and the prevalence of the disease or number of fatal cases. The figures as to protection must be accepted with caution. In Nimar District 85.11 of the population is shown as protected, but it is explained in the report that this is the result of the vaccination of foreigners who came into the district for famine relief. The general rise in the figures of protection may be attributed to the gradual replacement of adults who had received no vaccination by infants who under present conditions are vaccinated, and the high birth-rate of 1898 and 1899 gave a stimulus to such substitution. 7. The use of glycerinated lymph has been attended with results more satisfactory than in the previous year. It is reported that its use is better under- stood and that the staff has more confidence in it. But the subject is one the detailed examination of which may be deferred till the time of the triennial report. 8. The conduct and working of the staff forms the subject of general favourable comment. Vaccinators have plenty of work to do, not a small part of which lies outside the nominal range of their duties. When there is an outbreak of cholera in the district it follows almost as a matter of course that a Vaccinator is sent to the spot to supervise measures of sanitary precaution and to distribute medicine. During the past year the services of the staff have been utilized on plague and famine duty also. The Officiating Chief Commissioner is glad to have the opportunity of placing on record his acknowledgment of the meritorious services of the staff and of its careful supervision by the Administrative Medical Officer and Civil Surgeons.

NOTES ON VACCINATION IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES FOR THE SEASON 1899-1900. Cause of delay in submit- ting the Notes. The Notes were due in the Secretariat on the 10th June. The cause of delay in their submission is due to the late receipt of the returns from some of the Feudatory States (several of them not having been received till July) and to the non- receipt up to date of complete returns from the Sakti State. As, however, the Notes cannot be delayed any longer, the statements have been closed without them. Area in which Vaccination work was performed. 2. The area in which vaccine operations were performed in 1899-1900 remained about the same as in 1898-99. Vaccination Establishment. 3. The strength of the Khalsa and Feudatory State Vaccination establishment was as follows :2 6. The total number of operations performed both in the Khalsa and Feudatory States was 484,535, or 49,361 more than in the previous year. The figures for the past five years are compared as under:3 Increase or decrease in primary operations in different districts. 13. The following table shows the actual increase or decrease in the number of primary operations performed by Khalsa Vac- cinators in each district during the season 1899-1900 as compared with the season 1898-99:4 Vaccination operations in the Feudatory States. 20. The total number of primary and re-vaccination operations performed in the Feudatory States amounted to 82,049 and 6,092 respectively, being an increase of 5,306 in the former and a decrease of 5,776 in the latter, as compared with 1898-99.

6 Combined expenditure on vaccination in the Khalsa and Feudatory States. 22. The total amount expended in both the Khalsa and Feudatory States amounted to Rs. 49,742-10-8, or Rs. 1,184-2-6 less than in the previous year. 23. The average cost of each successful case was Re. 0-1-8¾ against Re. 0-1-11 9/10 in the preceding year. Expenditure on Provincial Vaccination 24. The total cost of the Provincial Vaccine Department for 1899-1900 amounted to Rs. 42,245-11-8 against Rs. 44,168-15-7, or Rs. 1,923-3-11 less than that of the previous year. The decrease is observed mainly under the heads &quot; Travelling Allowance&quot; and &quot; Establishment.&quot; The decrease under the former head is due to less travelling allowance having been drawn by Civil Surgeons, as owing to the prevalence of famine, their inspections were mostly restricted to the relief-camps. The decrease under the latter head is due to the deputation of certain Native Superintendents and Vaccinators to famine relief camps as Hospital Assistants or Compounders for a considerable period and to a post of Native Superintendent having remained vacant up to the beginning of the working season. 25. The average cost of each successful vaccination was Re. 0-1-9¾ against Re. 0-2-2 in the preceding year. Expenditure on Vaccination in Feudatory States. 26. The cost of the Vaccine Department of the Feudatory States (exclu- sive of Sakti) amounted to Rs. 7,496-15-0 as compared with Rs. 6,704-13-7 (excluding Sakti) in the previous year, or an increase of Rs. 792-1-5, due principally to the appointment of a Native Superintendent for each of the States of Raigarh, Rerakhole and Sonepur ; the entertainment of a clerk at Kawardha; the appointment of peons at Rerakhole Kalahandi and Patna, and the increased expenditure on contingencies. 27. The average cost of each successful operation was Re. 0-1-5 against Re. 0-1-3 5/7 in the previous year. Number of operations per- formed by Hospital Assistants. 28. The total number of operations performed by Hospital Assistants attached to dispensaries and famine relief camp hospitals in the Khalsa and Feudatory States (excluding Sakti, but including Bijapur the statistics of which were not included in the previous year's return) amounted to 24,788, or 10,712 more than in the previous year, of which 20,153 were primary and 4,635 re-vaccinations. The total number of persons successfully vaccinated was 22,172, and of these 13,154 were infants under one year. 29. Of the total number of operations performed by Hospital Assistants, 6,319 were carried out in hospitals attached to famine relief camps.
7 Inspection of operations 30. The following table shows the inspection work accomplished by Civil Surgeons and Native Superinten- dents of Vaccination:8 Inspection of operations in the Khalsa. 31. Civil Surgeons were 503 days on tour. They inspected 5,226 villages and saw 63,406 children, of whom 58,506 were found to have been successfully vaccinated. In the previous season, they spent 205 days more on tour, visited 1,603 more villages and saw 5,912 more children. 32. The decrease in the inspection work done by Civil Surgeons has already been explained in paragraph 24 above. 33. No Assistant Surgeon could be made available specially for inspection duty in the Nagpur District. The work here was carried out by the Inspecting Medical Officer of Famine Relief Camps (an Assistant Surgeon) in addition to his regular duties. In the Jubbulpore District, the inspections were carried out by the Civil Surgeon himself. 34. Native Superintendents were 2,705 days on tour, visited 15,715 villages and saw 201,975 children, of whom 191,928 had been successfully vaccin- ated. In the previous year, they were 3,211 days on tour, inspected 17,806 villages and saw 190,333 children, of whom 174,264 had been successfully vaccin- ated. The falling off in the number of days on which the Native Superinten- dents were on tour, was due to the above class of officers having been employed for a considerable period on duties connected with famine relief camps, and thus more time could not be spared by them for the performance of their regular duties. 35. The percentage of success as verified by Civil Surgeons was 92.27: by Native Superintendents 95.02 : and as returned by Vaccinators 96.65. 36. On the whole, inspection work was performed in a satisfactory manner. 37. Civil Surgeons saw 15.99 per cent. of the total number vaccinated: and Native Superintendents 50.95 per cent. Inspection of operations in Feudatory States. 38. In the Feudatory States, inspection work was less than in the previous year, due mainly to no inspection work having been done in the Kawardha, Rerakhole and Sarangarh States, owing to the employment of some of the Native Superintendents on famine duty, and to no return having been received from the Sakti State. Calf vaccination number of calves operated on 39. During the season, 9,842 calves were operated on and the lymph from 8,840 was taken into use. With this lymph, 276,137 children were vaccinated, 264,099 cases being returned as successful, as compared with 254,561 in the previous year. The total cost incurred in the cultivation of this lymph was Rs. 97-13-0, against Rs. 238-9-6 in the previous year. Details of Vaccination in the various districts 40.

The following is a summary of the method adopted in each district for the preservation of a supply of lymph:10 Nimar.II Mortality from small-pox as compared with proportion of persons protected by vaccina- nation. 42. The following table is appended in accordance with the recommendation of the Army Sanitary Com- missioners :12 46. In paragraph 2 of Government of India letter No. 3460, dated the 28th December 1899, attention was drawn to the discrepancy between the percentages of success reported by Vaccinators and those verified by superior Inspecting Officers in the returns for 1898-99, the district of Mandla being quoted as the most glaring example. During the season under report, the inconsis- tencies noted have not been so great, and Mandla has retrieved its reputation in this respect. A. SCOTT REID, COLONEL, I. M.

S., SECOND SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, HOME DEPARTMENT. Nagpur, the 3rd July 1901. With one spare copy. SIR, I am directed to submit herewith a copy* of the Annual Notes on Vaccination in the Central Provinces for the season 1900-1901. 2. The operations appear to have been generally successful, and the increase in the number of re-vaccinations is satisfactory. 3. The Officiating Chief Commissioner does not propose to issue a Reso- lution reviewing these notes. His comments will be reserved for the review on the triennial report. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, H. M. LAURIE, Second Secretary, Secretariat Press, Nagpur:TABLE OF CONTENTS. PARAS.

Cause of delay in submitting the Notes. The delay in submitting the Notes, which were due in the Secretariat on the 10th June, is owing to the late receipt of several returns from the Feudatory States, and to the non-receipt up to date of complete returns from the Sakti, Kawardha and Sarangarh States. As, however, the Notes cannot be delayed any longer, the statements have been closed without them. Area in which vaccination work was performed. 2. The area in which vaccination work was carried on was about the same as in the previous year. Vaccination establishment. 3. There was an increase of five Vaccinators and a decrease of two Native Superintendents in the strength of the Khalsa and Feu- datory State Vaccination Establishments as compared with the previous year, three additional Vaccinators (two Municipal and one Zamindari) in the Khalsa, and two in the Feudatory, States having been entertained, whilst the number of Native Superintendents was reduced by two in the Feudatory States. Total number of operations performed in the Khalsa and Feudatory States. 4. The total number of operations performed by Vaccinators in the Provinces (including Feudatory States) during the year under review was 437,596 (224,748 males and 212,848 females) or 46,939 less than in the previous year. 5. Primary vaccinations numbered 370,563 against 436,704 and re-vacci- nations 67,033 against 47,831 during the previous season. Thus there is a decrease in the former and an increase in the latter. 6. The percentage of successful primary cases was 96.97 against 96.50, and that of re-vaccinations 84.73 against 82.73 in the previous year, the average number of operations performed by each Vaccinator being 1,563, or 204 less. Vaccination operations in the Khalsa. 7. The total number of persons vaccinated in the Khalsa was 355,613 as compared with 396,394 in the previous year. The decrease occurred under the head &quot; Primary Vacci- nations.&quot; Increase or decrease in pri- mary operations in different districts. 8. Of the 18 districts, only three, viz. , Nagpur, Bilaspur and Narsinghpur, show an increase and the rest a decrease. The increase varied from 12,628 in the Nagpur, to 2,748 in the Narsingh- pur, District, and the decrease from 15,132 in the Bhandara, to 400 in the Mandla, District. 9. The decrease is due to the low birth-rate and the heavy mortality amongst children under one year of age, and also to the closing of famine-relief camps, which, in the year previous, afforded unusual facilities for vaccinating a large number of children. Children under one year of age available for vaccination and the number successfully vaccinated. 10. Deducting the deaths (143,079) under one year of age from the births (283,525) during the year 1900-1901, the apparent number of children available for vaccination was 140,446, while 189,837 were successfully vaccinated. The excess number represents those who were born during the first quarterof the year 1900, but who were left unprotected during 1899-1900 on account oftheir tender age.
2 Average number of operations performed by each Vaccinator and the percentage of success claimed. 11. The average number of operations performed by each Vaccinator in the Khalsa was 1,647 and the per- centage of success 97.13, the corresponding figures for the previous year being 1,868 and 96.65 respectively. Re-vaccination in the Khalsa 12. The particular attention of Civil Surgeons was drawn to the remarks contained in the concluding portion of paragraph 3 of the Honourable the Chief Commissioner's Resolution No. 7214, dated the 5th August 1900, on the Notes on Vaccination in these Provinces for the season 1899-1900, and the result has been that re-vaccinations show a considerable increase during the year under review, the number having risen from 41,739 in 1899-1900 to 52,054 in 1900-1901, an excess of 10,315, the number of successful cases being 44,213 and the percentage of success 84.94, or an increase of 3.62 over that of the previous year. With the exception of the Saugor, Nimar, Bhandara and Bilaspur Districts, the increase was general throughout the Provinces. Of the total number re-vaccinated 30,666 were adolescents and 21,388 adults. Primary and re-vaccination in the Feudatory States. 13. The total number of primary vaccinations performed in the Feudatory States was 67,004 against 82,049 in the previous year, and that of re-vaccinations 14,979 against 6,092. Thecause of decrease in primary vaccinations is the same as mentioned in paragraph 9of these notes. Vaccination in Municipali- ties. 14. An examination of the statement showing the number of children available for vaccination in Municipalities elicits the fact that in many towns the number of children vaccinated wasin excess of the apparent number available. The cause of this excess has beenexplained in paragraph 10 ante. Combined expenditure on vaccination in the Khalsa and Feudatory States. 15. As compared with the previous year, there was an increase of Rs. 579-1-10 in the total cost of the Provincial Vaccine Department and a decrease of Rs. 904-9-2 in the Feudatory States, due mainly, in the case of the former, to promotion of some of the Vaccinators and the entertainment of additional men, and, in the case of the latter, to the reduction in the establishment of two Native Superintendents and a Clerk, as also to the omission of the figures relating to the Sarangarh and Sakti States, from which no returns have been received. Dispensary vaccination. 16. There was a falling-off (6,987) in the total number of operations per- formed by Hospital Assistants, including those of the Feudatory States, the decrease being confined to the work of the establishment in the Khalsa. This is due to the Hospital Assistant attached to the Arvi Dispensary in the Wardha District having been relieved of vaccination duty, to no work of the kind having been done by the Hospital Assistant of the Sehora Dispensary in the Jubbulpore District, and to the absence of poor-houses and kitchens, where, in the previous year, a great deal of vaccination was performed. The percentage of success was slightly below that for 1899-1900. Inspections. 17. No Assistant Surgeon could be made available for inspection duty in the Nagpur and Jubbulpore Districts during the year under review. In the former, the work was carried out by a Hospital Assistant and in the latter by the Civil Surgeon himself. 18. The Civil Surgeons and Native Superintendents were 569 and 2,994 days on tour, and inspected 52,769 and 188,240 cases, respectively ; and of these, the former found 49,090 and the latter 176,411 to have been successfully vaccinated,the percentage of success as verified by Civil Surgeons being 93.03, by Native Superintendents 93.72, and as returned by Vaccinators 95.35. 19. The falling-off in the inspection work as compared with the previous year was due to the decrease in the number of vaccinations, to the inability of the Civil Surgeons of Raipur and Sambalpur to proceed on tour3 his own ill-health and the latter for want of camp equipage, and to the Civil Surgeons of Seoni and Chhindwara having been unable to make frequent inspec- tionsSTATEMENTS.

No. 6244. Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner, Central Provinces, in the General Department, dated Nagpur, the 14th July 1902. READ2 5. On the whole, vaccination is not unpopular. Some of the reports, such as those from Jubbulpore, Hoshangabad and Chanda, bear testimony to the dislike evinced towards it by certain sections of the community. But it cannot be said that there is any general antipathy to it. At the same time, the number of unvaccinated children in municipal areas, where, as a rule, the people are better educated and more intelligent, is considerable; and in some instances, such as those of Nagpur, Kalmeshwar, Saoner and Ramtek, to which the Commissioner of the Nagpur Division refers in his forwarding remarks, inquiry might usefully be directed to the causes of the apparent indifference or aversion of parents to the vaccination of young children. The statistics of Deori (Saugor), Deoli (Wardha), Seoni-Chappara and Pulgaon call for explanation in this respect. The matter should receive attention from the Civil Surgeons of the districts concerned,. 6. The Chief Commissioner has read the District Reports ; and he notes with satisfaction the good opinion uniformly expressed of the working of the staff. The best report is that submitted by Major Hendley, Civil Surgeon of the Hoshangabad District. This report and one or two others give evidence of the close personal supervision exercised by Civil Surgeons over this branch of their duties and of the good results accruing from it. The favourable account which such reports contain of the work of the staff is specially gratifying. ORDER.TABLE OF CONTENTS. Paras.

TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES FOR THE YEARS 1899-1900, 1900-01 AND 1901-02. Cause of delay in submitting the Report. The Report was due in the Secretariat on the 10th June. The delay in its submission is due to the non-receipt of several returns from the Feudatory States. As, however, the Report cannot be any longer delayed, the statements have been closed withoutthem. STATEMENT No. I. Population. 2. The population shown is that of the Census of 1901. The figures show a considerable reduction on those of the Census of 1891 owing to the two famines which occurred during the last decade. Area in which vaccination work was performed. 3. The area in which vaccination work was carried on was about the same as in previous years. Vaccination establishment. 4. There was some change in the strength of the vaccination staff during the last year of the triennial period. The Provincial staff was reduced by two Native Superintendents and two Vaccinators (one in Zamindaris) while one Municipal Vaccinator was enter- tained at Hinganghat in the Wardha District. The number of vaccinators work- ing in the Feudatory States remained the same as in the previous year. Total number of operations performed in the Khalsa and Feudatory States 5. The total number of vaccine operations, primary and secondary, per- formed throughout the Province (including Feudatory States) in the last three years, by both Vaccinators and Hospital Assistants, is shown in the following table:2 Percentage of success claim- ed by Vaccinators. 8. The percentage of success in primary vaccinations was 96.68 as com- pared with 96.97 in 1900-1901 and 96.50 in 1899-1900, while re-vaccination had an average success of 84.29 as against 84.73 and 82.73 in the preceding two years. Persons successfully vacc-nated per 1,000 of population. 9. The number of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of popu- lation was 32.65 against 32.15 in 1900-1901 and 36.18 in 1899-1900. Vaccination operations in the Khalsa. 10. The total number of operations performed by Khalsa Vaccinators in the year 1901-1902 was considerably less than in the two previous ones. The decrease occurred under the head &quot; Primary vaccinations.&quot; Average number of opera- tions performed by Khalsa Vaccinators. 11. Throughout the last working season each Vaccinator performed, on an average, 1,504 operations, or 143 and 364 less than in 1900-1901 and 1899-1900, respectively. 12. The work done during the past year by individuals varied from 1,017 in Bhandara to 2,965 in Narsinghpur. Primary vaccinations in the Khalsa. 13. The total number of primary vaccinations was less by 34,289 than in 1900-1901; compared with 1899-1900 primary vaccina- tions were fewer by 85,385. 14. In successful primary operations there was a decrease of 34,004 and 81,928 as compared with 1900-1901 and 1899-1900, respectively. 15. Of the total successful primary vaccinations, 183,147 were performed upon infants under one year of age, 55,071 upon children over one and under six years, and 22,636 upon children of the age of six years and above. Increase or decrease in pri- mary operations in different districts. 16. Three districts, viz., Saugor, Betul and Chhindwara, show an increase and the rest a decrease as compared with the previous year. The increase varied from 387 in Chhindwara to 798 in Betul, and the decrease from 44 in Sambalpur to 7,235 in Bilaspur, the other districts which show a large decrease being Raipur (6,388), Narsinghpur (3,708), Balaghat (3,169), Jubbulpore (3,102), Bhandara (2,368), Nimar (2,276), Nagpur (2,254), Wardha (1,670) and Hoshangabad (1,669). Bilaspur and Raipur, which show the greatest decrease, are districts in the Chhattisgarh Division in which famine was severe in 1899-1900. The popu- lation of these two districts has largely decreased, whereas that of Sambalpur in the same Division has increased. Compared with the year 1899-1900, Nagpur and Bilaspur show an increase and the others a decrease. The districts which return a large decrease are :3 Children under one year available for vaccination and the number successfully vaccin- ated. 18. The total number of children under one year of age available for vaccination and the number of successful operations performed on them during the year 1901-1902 is shown below:4 Number successfully vacci- nated per 1,000 of population. 26. The number successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population was 30.93 against 31.44 in the preceding year, or a decrease of 0.51. Compared with 1899-1900 the decrease is 4.68 Primary and re-vaccinations in Feudatory States. 27. The total number of primary and re-vaccinations performed in Feuda- tory States amounted to 68,738 and 18,818, respectively, being an increase of 1,734 in the former and of 3,839 in the latter as compared with the previous year. Compared with the year 1899- 1900 there was a decrease of 13,311 under &quot; Primary &quot; and an increase of 12,726 under &quot; Re-vaccination.&quot; 28. The large increase in the number of re-vaccinations is due to this work having been started in certain villages of the Patna State, in which it had never before been attempted; to special attention having been paid to certain villages of the Kalahandi State in which small-pox was prevalent; and to the general improvement in the public health permitting a freer recourse to the operation. 29. The percentage of success claimed by Vaccinators is 95.93 in primary vaccination and 86.34 in re-vaccination as compared with 96.23 and 84.02, res- pectively, in 1900-1901. In 1899-1900 it was 95.82 in primary and 92.42 in re-vaccinations. Lymph cultivation 30. During the non-working season, in almost all the districts, the supply of lymph was kept up at Head-Quarters by arm-to-arm vaccination or by buffalo-calf retro-vaccination ; and this was issued to Vaccinators to commence the work of the season. The Vaccinators subsequently maintained their supply of lymph by vaccinating cow or buffalo calves in the interior of the district. 31. In November last, Colonel Scott Reid ascertained, during his visit to the Nimar District, that vaccination with glycerinated lymph, prepared locally, was being carried on with marked success, and that most, if not all, the difficul- ties formerly experienced in this method had been overcome; he thereupon obtained from the Civil Surgeon (Major Banatvala) a note describing the exact mode of preparation adopted and circulated it to all Civil Surgeons in the Pro- vince for guidance. The results from the use of this lymph in 1901-02 show a marked improvement, the percentage of success being 90.96 as compared with 86.97 and 86.27 in the two preceding years. Calf vaccination. 32. 9,922 calves were vaccinated in the Province with the following results.5 STATEMENT No. II. Expenditure on provincial vaccination. 35. The total cost of the Provincial Vaccination Department amounted to Rs. 42,956-4-6 against Rs. 42,824-13-6 in 1900-1901 and Rs. 42,245-11-8 in 1899-1900. The differences are slight and call for no comment. 36. The average cost of each successful vaccination last year was Re. 0-2-3 against Re. 0-2-0¼ in the previous year and Re 0-1-9¾ in the year 1899-1900. The increased cost is due to the smaller number of successful opera- tions performed. Expenditure on vaccination in Feudatory States. 37. The total cost of the vaccination establishment in Feudatory States, exclusive of Khairagarh, Kanker, Kawardha, Sarangarh and Raigarh, from which no returns have been received, amounted to Rs. 5,311-3-4. The requisite figures not being available for all the States, no comparison can be made of the average cost of each successful vacci- nation during the past three years. STATEMENT No. III. Number of operations per- formed by Hospital Assistants in the Khalsa 38. The total number of vaccinations performed by Hospital Assistants attached to dispensaries in the Central Provinces, exclud- ing Feudatory States, was 12,987 against 15,464 in the previous year and 22,744 in 1899-1900. Of these, 10,665 were primary operations and 2,322 re-vaccinations, 6,975 being successful primary operations on infants under one year of age The decrease is due to the same causes as explained in paragraph 17 of this report. 39. The percentage of success in primary vaccinations was 94.62 as com- pared with 92.34 in 1900-1901 and 92.87 in 1899-1900, while re-vaccinations show an average success of 74.29 against 60.31 and 75.01 in the two preceding years. 40. In the Narsinghpur District no vaccination was performed by Hospital Assistants. The work in towns in which a dispensary is located was done entirely by Municipal Vaccinators. Operations performed by Hospital Assistants in Feuda. tory States. 41. The total number of operations performed by Hospital Assistants attached to Feudatory State dispensaries was 2,170, of which 1,811 were primary vaccinations and 359 re-vacci- nations. As no returns have been received from seven ofthese institutions, the work cannot be compared with that of the two previousyears. STATEMENT No. IV. Progress of primary vaccina- tion since 1867 42. Calls for no remark. STATEMENT No. V. Inspections. 43. This statement has been prepared in accordance with the instructions contained in Government of India letter No. 2239, dated the 30th November last. 44. Civil Surgeons were 700 days on tour against 569 in the previous year and 503 in the year 1899-1900. They saw 56,377 cases against 52,769 in 1900- 1901 and 63,406 in 1899-1900. Of the total number inspected, 53,286 were found to have been successfully vaccinated against 49,090 and 58,506 in the preceding. two years. No inspections were carried out by the Civil Surgeon, Bilaspur, owing to the office having changed hands several times during the season. 45. As no Assistant Surgeon could be made available for inspection duty in the Jubbulpore District during the past year, the work there had to be carried out by the Civil Surgeon himself. In the Nagpur District an Assistant Surgeon was specially deputed for the purpose.
6 46. Native Superintendents were 2,892 days on tour against 2,994 in the previous year. They inspected 167,019 vaccinated children against 188,240 and 201,975 in 1900-1901 and 1899-1900, respectively, and found 156,304 success- fully vaccinated against 176,411 in the previous year and 191,928 in 1899-1900. 47. The Makrai State is the only one which has sent in an inspection return. Therefore no remarks are made under this head as regards the Feudatory States. APPENDIX A. Vaccination in Municipalities. 48. During the year, the Vaccination Act was not extended to any fresh Municipal town. Out of 45 municipalities in the Pro- vince, the Act is in force in 35 only ; it is to be hoped that ere long it may be extended to the remaining 10. 49. Of the 16,555 children under one year available for vaccination in Municipal towns 12,151, equal to 73.40 per cent., were successfully vaccinated against 12,095 in the previous year and 14,009 in the year 1899-1900. 50. In the municipalities in which the Vaccination Act is in force, the percentage of available children under one year who were successfully vaccinated varied between 20.95 in Deori (Saugor District) and 136.36 in Mandla. 51. In the Municipal towns of Gadarwara, Burhanpur, Mandla and Bilaspur a larger number of children under one year were vaccinated than are shown as available in the return No explanation of this is offered by the Civil Surgeons concerned. It would appear, however, that the Vaccinators of these towns were at some pains to discover and vaccinate unprotected children other than those shown in the local birth register. 52. The percentage of available children successfully vaccinated in thefollowing municipalities, in all of which the Vaccination Act is in force, was verylowSTATEMENTS.

NOTES ON VACCINATION IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES FOR THE SEASON 1902-03. Cause of delay in submitting the notes. The notes were due in the Secretariat on the 10th June. Delay in their submission is due to the late receipt of returns from the Feudatory States of the Chhattisgarh Division, the last of which was received on the 2nd June. As directed in the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner's Resolution on the last Triennial Report, I placed myself in communication with the Commissioner, Chhattisgarh Division, with the object of securing more punctual submission of these returns. I regret to say that my efforts have not so far been attended with success. I have good reason, however, to hope that there will be no cause for complaint on this account in future. Vaccination Establishment. 2 During the year there was an increase of two vaccinators in the Khalsa Establishment and a decrease of one in that of Feuda- tory States. Reason for not comparing the work done in Feudatory States 3. In regard to Feudatory States in the Chhattisgarh Division, the statistics appended to these notes relate to nine months only, viz., from 1 st April to 31st December 1902. As other Annual Returns submitted to Government by the Feudatory States in question relate to the calendar year, it was considered that punctuality would be better secured if the Vaccination Returns were also prepared for the same period. Accordingly, it was arranged that, commencing with 1902-03, the Feudatory States in the Chhat- tisgarh Division should submit their vaccination returns for the calendar year. The figures for the first three months of 1902 have been excluded from the present returns, as they have already been included in the returns for 1901-02 In view of the above, the statistics relating to Feudatory States have been excluded in comparing the results for 1902-03 with those for 1901-02. Total number of operations performed in the Province (Statement I) 4. The total number of vaccinations performed in the Khalsa and Feudatory States (including dispensary vaccinations) during the year under report was 464.051 (398,0651 primary and 65,986 re-vaccinations), the percentage of success in primary vaccination being 97.13 and in re-vaccination 85.14. The average number of operations performed by each vaccinator was 1,598. Total number of operations performed in the Khalsa 5 The total number vaccinated by the Provincial staff (including Hospital Assistants) was 398,535. Of these, 352,587 were primary and 45,948 re-vaccinations, showing an increase of 72,652 or 25.95 per cent. in the former and a decrease of 9,783 or 17.55 per cent. in the latter as compared with 1901-02. Of the total number re-vaccinated, 21,581 were adolescents and 24,367 adults. Total number of operations performed by Provincial vac- cinators 6. The total number of persons vaccinated by Provincial Vaccinators was 383,529 as compared with 322,679 in 1901-02. Primary vaccinations increased by 69,869. Re-vaccinations on the contrary decreased by 9,019. The average number of vaccinations performed by each vaccinator was 1,773 or 269 more than in 1901- 02. In the Chhindwara district, one vaccinator did 3,209 primary and 344 re-vac- cinations. Work like this deserves to be rewarded. Increase or decrease in pri- mary operations in different districts and the cause of such fluctuations. 7. With two exceptions, all districts show an increase in primary vaccina- tions In Bhandara, where excellent work was done, this increase amounts to no less than 86 per cent.; in Wardha, too, the increase is large, amounting as it does to 54 per cent. The very high birth-rate of 1902 combined with comparatively low infant mortality accounts in the main for the increase. To this should be added the commendable activity shown by the vaccination staff in some districts. In Narsinghpur, primary vaccinations decreased by 4,926. The Civil Surgeon attributes the decrease to the withdrawal of vaccinators for plague duty early in March. This does not fully account for the falling off. For the last three years there has been a progressive decrease in primary vaccinations in
2 this district. In the Nagpur District, primary vaccinations fell off by 519. During the latter portion of the working season, vaccination was at a standstill in the city and was interfered with in some towns and villages by reason of plague. Yet it cannot be regarded as satisfactory that of available children under one year, little more than half (57 per cent) were successfully vaccinated. Children under one year of age available for vaccination and the number successfully vaccinated in the Khalsa 8. Of 357,679 children under one year available for vaccination (that is the total births less deaths under one year in 1902-03)283,891 or 79.37 per cent. were successfully vaccinated. In the Bhandara district the percentage was as high as 92.70; in Betul, Wardha and Sambalpur the figures are also high. The districts which return the lowest percentages are Chanda (56.65), Nagpur (56 67) and Jubbulpore (61.22). Chanda is a large district with a scattered population; better results, however, might have been expected. The poor results in Nagpur and Jubbulpore are to some extent accounted for by plague. Plague, however, was present in other districts (Nimar, Hoshangabad, &c.) without a corresponding decline in vaccination work. Results of primary opera- tions. 9. On the whole, the results of primary operations as performed by the Provincial staff are satisfactory, except in Chanda and Chhindwara. In the former, the percentage of successful cases is only 90.61, in the latter 93.34. Re vaccination in the Khalsa 10. As compared with 1901-02 there was a drop of 9,019 in the number of re-vaccinations. This is distributed over twelve districts and ranges from 4,073 in Chanda to 201 in Narsinghpur. The Civil Surgeon of Chhindwara discouraged the re-vaccination of mothers each time they brought up children for vaccination : he found that some women had in this way been re-vaccinated two or three times within five years. The Civil Surgeon of Damoh writes that re-vaccination was interfered with by a rumour that it was really plague inoculation. The operation is in general unpopular. It would appear, however, that sufficient attention has not been paid to it in some districts. In Nagpur, Hoshangabad, Saugor and Jubbulpore the total re-vaccinations were 143, 270, 303 and 408 respectively, a great contrast to Chhindwara with 7,123 re-vaccinations and to Narsinghpur with 5,978. It is difficult to understand the very successful results of re-vaccination recorded in some districts In six districts the percentage of success claimed exceeds 90, and in one (Mandla) it is claimed that 97.93 of the re-vaccinations were successful. This is in marked contrast to 26.60 in Nimar, a well-vaccinated district. Expenditure on vaccination in the Khalsa (Statement II). 11. The total cost of the Provincial Vaccine Department for 1902-03 amounted to Rs. 42,162-9-0 or Rs. 793-11-6 less than in 1901-02. The decrease occurred under &quot;Travelling allowance.&quot; Less touring was done by Civil Surgeons owing mainly to the presence of plague in several districts. The average cost of each successful case was Re. 0-1-10 or five pies less than in the preceding year. Dispensary vaccination (Statement III). 12. As compared with 1901-02 there was an increase of 2,019 in the number of dispensary vaccinations in the Khalsa. &quot; Primary vaccinations &quot; increased by 2,783 while re-vaccinations decreased by 764. The total number of children under one year successfully vaccinated was 3,631 more than in the previous year. In the Narsinghpur district, dispensary vaccination has been in abeyance for some years. Arrangements have now been made to start it again. In two dispensaries of the Chanda District no vaccination was done last year. It is hoped that this default will not occur again. In general, dispensary vaccination is best limited to the town in which the dispensary is situated. nspections (Statement V). 13. Civil Surgeons and Native Superintendents were 533 and 3,026 days on tour, against 700 and 2,892 days respectively in 1901-02. The former inspected 15,301 primary and 1,047 re-vaccina- tions more and the latter 52,076 primary vaccinations more and 5,196 re-vaccina- tions less than in the previous year. The falling off in the Jubbulpore, Narsingh- pur, Hoshangabad and Nimar Districts was due to plague. The result of these inspections, as compared with the figures reported by vaccinators, was, on the whole, satisfactory. In Chanda, the percentage of successful primary vaccinations
3 as verified by the Native Superintendent appears abnormally high when contrasted with the percentage of success claimed by vaccinators. I may here note that the results of primary vaccinations as verified by Inspecting Officers in Feudatory States are unsatisfactory. Lymph cultivation. 14. 10,334 calves were vaccinated, of which 9,407 were successful, 742 unsuccessful and 185 were rejected for suppuration or excessive inflammation. The cost incurred was about the same as in 1901-02 (Rs. 190-3-3 against Rs. 184-1-6). In some districts, notably Raipur, there has been considerable difficulty in getting calves. In others, such as Wardha and Balaghat, there has been no difficulty, and the calves have cost nothing. Operations performed with different kinds of lymph. 15. The different kinds of lymph used, the number vaccinated with each kind, and the percentage successful are as follows:STATEMENTS.

No. 7384. FROM F. S. A. SLOCOCK, ESQ., I. C. S., SECOND SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, HOME DEPARTMENT. Nagpur, the 1st July 1904. *With one spare Copy. SIR, I am directed to submit herewith a copy* of the annual notes on vaccination in the Central Provinces and Berar for the season 1903-04, and to say that the work of the year will be reviewed in due course when the triennial report for the years ending with 1905 comes to be dealt with. 2. The statements have been prepared in the prescribed forms, except column 6 of statement I, which has not the sub-columns prescribed in the revised form received with Mr. Marris' letter No. 1605, dated the 30th October 1903, and the Administrative Medical Officer's attention has been irawn to this mistake. The report does not give any reason to account for the netraordinarily high percentage of success claimed in re-vaccination in the Central Provinces, and specially in the Feudatory States as compared with the much lower per- centage in Berar, but the Administrative Medical Officer has promised to give the subject his attention. 3. As explained in paragraph 24 of the notes, the necessity for referring for the first time in some detail to Berar statistics has caused the notes to exceed the prescribed limit of three pages. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedien Servant, F. S. A. SLOCOCK, Second Secretary. Secretariat Press, Nagpur:NOTES ON VACCINATION IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES AND BERAR FOR THE SEASON 1903-04. Cause of delay in submitting the notes. The notes will, I fear, be overdue owing to late receipt of certain returns and to illness and consequent disorganisation in my office. They were sent to Press on the 7th June 1904. I would also add that in dealing with the matter in hand, I labour under the disadvantage of having only recently assumed charge of this office, and have therefore not been present during any portion of the period under review. Transfer of the control of the Berar Vaccination Deprartment to the Administrative Medical Officer, Central Provinces. 2. The control of the Vaccination Department, Berar, was transferred to the Administrative Medical Officer, Central Provinces, on the 1st November 1903. The statistics of Berar are accordingly included in the appended statements. Control of District vaccin- ation vested in Civil Surgeons in Berar. 3. The practice in the Central Provinces of appointing Civil Surgeons as Superintendents of the Vaccination staff in their respective districts has now been extended to Berar. Vaccination Establishment 4. The establishment in the Central Provinces was kept up to the sanc- tioned strength. In Berar two vacancies of Vaccinators were not filled, in view of the reorganization of the De- partment for the combined Provinces, for which proposals have been submitted to the Local Administration. Reason for not comparing the work done in Feudatory States 5. Under instructions from the Government of India, the statistics for the Feudatory States have been obtained for the official instead of for the calendar year, in order that the figures exhibiting the work done in Feudatory States may relate to the same period as those for British territory. As the statistics in regard to Feudatory States appended to the note on the Vaccination Report for 1902-03 related to nine months only, viz., from the 1st April to 31st December 1902, no comparison with the present year's statistics can be made. Substitution of revised forms of Vaccination Statements I and III. 6. Statements I and III appended to this note have been prepared in the revised forms which provide additional columns showing (1) number of unknown primary and re-vaccination cases, (2) percentages of unknown cases to total cases. The percentage of success attending vaccination operations has consequently been calculated on the figures, exclusive of unknown cases. Total number of operations performed in the Central Pro- vinces. 7. The total number of vaccinations performed in the Khalsa and Feudatory States (including Dispensary vaccination) in the Central Provinces during the year under review was 522,609 (446,411 primary and 76,198 re-vaccination cases), the percentage of success in primary vaccinations being 98.65 and in re-vaccinations 87.74. The average number of vaccinations performed by- each Vaccinator was 1,815. Total number of operations performed in the Khalsa. 8. The total number vaccinated by the Provincial staff (including Hospital Assistants) was 403,677. Of these 355,114 were pri- mary, and 48,563 re-vaccination cases. As compared with 1902-03 there is an increase of 2,527 (or 0.72 per cent). in the former, and 2,615 (or 5.69 per cent.) in the latter. Total number of operations performed by Provincial vac- cinators. 9. The total number of vaccinations performed by Provincial Vaccinators was 391,327 as compared with 383,529 in 1902-03. Primary and re-vaccination cases show an increase of 4,914 and 2,884, respectively. The average number of vaccinations performed by each vaccinator was 1,803, or 30 more than in 1902-03.
2 Berar. 10. The total number of vaccinations performed in Berar was 123,696 (101,401 primary and 22,295 re-vaccinations): the per- centage of success in primary vaccinations was 97.92 and in re-vaccinations 15.60. The average number of operations performed by each vaccinator was 3,255. Increase or decrease in pri- mary operations in different districts. 11. Compared with 1902-03 twelve districts, viz., Jubbulpore, Mandla, Seoni, Narsinghpur, Hoshangabad, Nagpur, Chanda, Bhandara, Balaghat, Raipur, Sambalpur and Akola, show increases ranging from 143 in Sambalpur to 2,962 in Mandla. The other districts show decreases ranging from 286 in Damoh to 1,993 in Saugor. The increase in primary vaccination may be attributed to the high birth-rate which, with the exception of the year 1902, was the highest recorded during the past two decades. Despite the prevalence of plague, good work was done in the districts of Nagpur, Hoshangabad and Jubbulpore. Narsinghpur, which showed a steady decrease during the past four years in primary vaccin- ations, returns an increase of 1,515 over the figure reported last year. Berar. 12. All the Berar districts except Akola show a considerable decrease in primary vaccinations. The decrease is most marked in Amraoti, Ellichpur and Basim. The decrease is attri- buted chiefly to plague and to a breakdown of the Lymph Depôt at Amraoti, which retarded work for about a month. Children under one year of age available for vaccination and the number successfully vaccinated in the Khalsa and Berar. 13. Deducting the deaths under one year of age from the births during 1903-04, the number of children who became available for vaccination during the year both in the Central Provinces and Berar was 411,166. The number success- fully vaccinated was 358,618, or 87.22 per cent. In the district of Nimar the percentage was as high as 118.50 and in Wardha and Bhandara the percentages were 106.66 and 106.41, respectively. In Narsinghpur, Chhindwara, Betul, Balaghat, Chanda, Bilaspur, Sambalpur, Amraoti, Ellichpur and Wun the figures are also high. The number of successful vaccinations on children under one year of age includes visitors from outside and those that were left unprotected during 1902-03 on account of tender age, etc. This accounts for the high percentage of success in some districts. The districts which return the lowest percentages are Jubbulpore (70.70), Nagpur (73.30), Buldana (7370), but the success attained in the first two districts is an improvement on last year. Result of primary vaccination. 14. The percentage of successful cases in which the results were known was generally very satisfactory. The districts which showed unsatisfactory results last year show an improve- ment this year. Re-vaccination in Khalsa. 15. Compared with the previous year there was an increase of 2,884 in the number re-vaccinated in the Central Provinces. The largest increases are reported from Bhandara (6,201), Sambalpur (4,009) and Betul (3,684). In Bhandara several vaccinators are reported to have needlessly re-vaccinated children in order to swell their numbers. The Civil Surgeon has promised to remedy this practice. The percentages of successful cases of re-vaccination in the Central Provinces and Berar are in marked contrast: while in the former they appear unduly high, ranging from 36.11 in Nimar to 100.00 in Saugor, in the latter they are extremely low, being only 5.84 in Ellichpur and 23.90 in Buldana. There may be differences of opinion as to what constitutes a successful operation, but the subject will receive attention. In Berar (except in Buldana and Ellichpur, which show increases) the total number of re-vaccination cases was 1,210 less than in 1902-03. The percentage of success (15.60) was slightly lower than the previous year. Of the total number re-vaccinated 40,650 were adolescents and 30,208 were adults. Expenditure on vaccination in Khalsa (Statement II). 16. The total cost of the operations in the Central Provinces during 1903-04 amounted to Rs. 42,638-12-8, or Rs. 476-3-8 more than in 1902-03. The increase has occurred under the head &quot; Travelling allowances,&quot; whilst under all other heads the expenditure is lower than in the year previous. The average cost of each successful case was 1 anna 10 pies as in the previous year.
3 Berar. 17. In Berar the total expenditure amounted to Rs. 17,325-3-9 against Rs. 18,036-11 -10 in the previous year. The average cost of each successful operation was-2 annas and 9 pies against 2 annas and 5 pies in the previous year. Dispensary Vaccination Statement No. III. 18. As compared with 1902-03 there was a decrease of 2,656 in the number of Dispensary vaccinations in the Khalsa. Both primary and re-vaccination cases show decreases of 2,387 and 269, respectively. The total number of children under one year successfully vacci- nated was 8,415, or 2,191 less than in the previous year. In Narsinghpur, where Dispensary vaccination was in abeyance for some years, 66 primary vaccinations were performed during the year under report by the Hospital Assistant of Tendukhera. In the districts of Narsinghpur, Hoshangabad, Nimar and Chhind- wara no re-vaccination was done. The decrease in Dispensary vaccination is presumably the result of the fall in attendance at Dispensaries owing to plague. No Dispensary vaccination is done in Berar Statement No. V 19. In the Central Provinces Civil Surgeons and Native Superintendents were on tour for 705 and 3,053 days as against 533 and 3,026 days, respectively, in 1902-03, and this is satisfactory considering that the Province was infected with plague almost throughout the year. The Civil Surgeons inspected 5,488 primary and 2,094 re-vaccinations less and the Native Superintendents of Vaccination 20,147 primary vaccinations and 2,200 re-vaccinations less than in the previous year. The plague was the chief cause of the falling-off in inspections in the districts of Nagpur, Chanda, Betul, Mandla, Hoshangabad, Saugor and Chhindwara. I regret to remark that vaccination inspec- tion has been neglected in the Feudatory States of Khairagarh, Sakti, Kawardha, Rehrakhol and Sonepur, whilst in the others there has apparently been much improvement. In Berar Civil Surgeons inspected 1,905 primary more and 10 re-vaccination cases less, and Superintendents of Vaccination 22,461 primary and 451 re-vaccination cases less than in the previous year. The result of inspections by Native Superintendents of Vaccination in Basim (22.07) and Buldana (46.91) is unsatisfactory, and is due in the former district to inefficiency on the part of the Native Superintendent. Many of the Civil Surgeons complain of the new rule introduced last year to inspect children at the people's own villages instead of collecting them at a fixed centre. They allege that it hampers their work, and makes efficient inspection impossible with the limited time at their disposal I cannot think that Colonel Moriarty intended that the rule should be enforced literally. The practice, if it existed, of causing people to travel long distances is to be deprecated, but I consider it no hardship to collect people within a limited radius and would prefer to leave it to the discretion of Civil Surgeons not to unduly harass the people. Lymph cultivation in the Central Provinces. 20. Eight thousand six hundred and forty calves were vaccinated during the year, of which 7,806 were successful, 719 proved unsuccessful, and 115 were rejected for suppuration or excessive inflammation. The expenditure incurred was Rs. 260-2-8 against Rs. 190-3-3. Operations performed with different kinds of lymph in the Central Provinces. 21. The following statement gives the different kinds of lymph used, the number vaccinated with each kind and the percentage of success obtained in each case:4 was better, no quarrels arose with the people of distant villages about calves, fewer calves were necessary, and ulcerations were fewer, as the lymph was a week or 10 days' old before use. Major Buchanan has written a short Vaccina- tion Manual now in the press, which will be published in English and Hindi. Colonel Moriarty proposed to distribute a copy to each Vaccinator and Hospital Assistant. Civil Surgeons will be asked to arrange for the manufacture of glycerinated calf lymph at head-quarters only, as. described in the Manual. The former practice of preparing it at dispensaries was not a success in some districts. For Berar lanolinated lymph is manufactured at the Amraoti Paste Depôt under the supervision of the Civil Surgeon, and is supplied to all Vaccin- ators in the Province. The results have been fairly good. Vaccination in Municipalities (Appendix A). 22. During the year no new town either in the Central Provinces or in Berar came under the operation of the Vaccination Act. Of 21,422 children under one year available for vaccin- ation only 17,769 were vaccinated. In 13 Municipalities, more children than were available were successfully vaccinated which is due to an influx of people from outside. It is unsatisfactory to record that the Municipalities men- tioned in paragraph 16 of last year's report, viz., Saugor, Damoh, Jubbulpore, Mandla, Chhindwara, Nagpur, Wardha, Raipur and Sambalpur, still show that vaccination work is very backward. The municipal towns of Narsinghpur, Hoshangabad, Mandla, Ellichpur City, Ellichpur Civil Station and Yeotmal also show that vaccination work has been much neglected during the year under review. Plague is partly accountable for the decrease in vaccination work in municipal towns. Mortality from small-pox as compared with proportion of persons protected by vaccina- tion 23. The mortality from small-pox was less than in the three previous years. The proportion per 1,000 of population in the Central Provinces protected by vaccination was 39.24, a slight increase of .59 on the year previous, whilst in Berar it was 36.58 or 6.12 less than in the previous year. The usual diagram is appended. General Remarks 24. The results of the year's working of the Vaccination Department are on the whole gratifying, considering that plague has been prevalent in almost every district. There seems to be no active dislike to vaccination on the part of the people generally, although re-vaccination appears to be unpopular. Several Native Superintendents and Vaccinators are commended for having done good work and the department generally appears to have maintained harmonious relations with the people. The necessity of referring in some detail to Berar statistics, now included in the notes for the first time, has caused them to exceed the prescribed limits. R. MACRAE, COL , M. B., I. M. S., Offg. Administrative Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Central Provinces and Berar. NAGPUR The 5th June 1904.

TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES AND BERAR FOR THE YEARS 1902-03, 1903-04 AND 1904-05. Cause of delay in submitting Report. The Report cannot, I fear, reach the Secretariat on due date ; the delay in sending it to Press is, as in former years, due to the belated receipt of returns from the Feudatory States; the Commissioner, Chhattisgarh Division, will again be addressed in this connection, and it is hoped that the Feudatory States Returns may, in future, be submitted more punctually. Population and area in which vaccination work was perform- ed (Statement I). 2. The population shown in 1904-05 and in the two years previous is that of the Census of 1901,viz., 14,627,045. At the close of 1904 the deduced population was close on 6 per cent. in advance of these figures. The area in general is the same as in previous years. In the Chanda District vaccination work was for the first time extended to certain zamindaris. Vaccination Establishment. 3. The strength of the Central Provinces Khalsa establishment remained the same as in the previous year. In Feudatory States the establishment was increased by one Vaccinator. A complete scheme for the re-organization of the Vaccination Department in the combined Provinces was sanctioned by the Government of India in August 1904, and will, it is hoped, be very shortly brought into force. Pending the introduction of the new scheme three appointments of Native Superintendents of Vaccination and one of Vaccinator were not filled in Berar in 1904-05, whilst in the year previous two appointments of Vaccinators were kept vacant. Under the new scheme the position of Vaccinators and Native Superintendents in the Central Provinces is materially improved. Total number of operations performed in the Central Pro- vinces and Berar including Feudatory States. 4. The total number of operations performed by Vaccinators and Hospital Assistants in the Central Pro- vinces (including Feudatory States) and Berar during the past three years is given in the following table :2 Primary and re-vaccinations in the Central Provinces and Berar including Feudatory States. 5. Primary vaccinations in 1904-05 numbered 606,482 against 547,812 and 515,624 in 1903-04 and 1902-03, respectively. The number of re-vaccinations performed amounted to 83,315 against 98,493 and 89,491 in the two preceding years. In other words primary vaccinations show a large and steady increase, while re-vaccinations show a marked decrease. Percentage of success. 6. The percentage of success in primary operations in which the results were known was 98.73 as compared with 98.52 in 1903-04, and in re-vaccinations 73.78 against 74.32 in 1903-04. For primary vaccinations the figures are satisfactory, but in regard to re-vaccination the percentage of success claimed is still too high. Persons succeesfully vaccin- ated per 1,000 of population. 7. The number of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population was 44.26 against 41.07 in 1903-04 and 38.32 in 1902-03. If the deduced population at the end of 1904 be taken as the basis of calculation, the protection afforded in 1904-05 amounted to a little under 42 per 1,000 of population3 Nagpur is satisfactory, but there is still a good deal of leeway to be made up. The very high birth-rate of 1904 and the comparatively low infant mortality, combined with good work on the part of the vaccination staff in general, account for the general increase of primary vaccinations. In Wardha although there was a small decrease as compared with 1903-04, yet 93 per cent. of available infants under one year were vaccinated. In Balaghat plague is said to have interfered a good deal with vaccination, in such case re-vaccinations should have decreased considerably, whereas on the contrary they have increased; in Buldana plague certainly interfered with vaccination work, moreover there was one Vaccinator short. Children under one year available for vaccination and the number of these success- fully vaccinated. 12. The number of children under one year of age available for vaccination in any given year is the number of births in that year less the number of deaths under one year during the same period. The successful primary operations per- formed on infants under one year during the past three years and the percentage of these to the total available are as follows:4 previous year. As the statistics for 1902-03 relate to nine months only, i. e., from 1st April to 31st December 1902, no comparison of these with the present year's statistics can be made. It is somewhat remarkable that in the Patna State the re-vaccinations largely exceed the primary vaccinations; the high percentage of success claimed in re-vaccinations suggests that many of the latter were really primary operations. In the Patna and Bastar States vaccination appears to flourish ; in Makrai, on the other hand, the work done was very inadequate, the State officials do not appear to have given the assistance that might reasonably have been expected from them. The percentage of success claimed by Vaccinators was 97.98 in primary vaccinations and 89.81 in re-vaccination against 97.78 and 87 97, respectively, in the preceding year. Operations performed with different kinds of lymph. 16. The following table shows the different kinds of lymph used in the Central Provinces and the results attained during each of the past three years: 5 to supply any districts in which this cannot be done from other districts where the supply of calves is adequate and the arrangements are satisfactory. It has recently been shown that the purification of lymph which is effected by glycerine in many days can be effected by chloroform vapour in a few hours, and that the lymph so purified when subsequently mixed with glycerine retains its potency for a long period, varying with the temperature; the great advantage of this method is the saving of time, the lymph can be issued at once instead of keeping it for a week or more; it is hoped that it may be possible to introduce this improved method of purifying vaccine lymph. Expenditure on vaccination (Statement II). 18. The total cost of the Provincial Vaccine Department in the Central Provinces amounted to Rs. 44,564-13-11 or Rs. 1,926-1-3 more than in the previous year and Rs. 2,402-4-11 more than in 1902-03. The increase is mainly due to the increase of travelling allow- ance charges, to the extra cost incurred in manufacturing glycerinated lymph and to the payment of rewards to Vaccinators specially commended for good work. The average cost of each successful case was one anna and nine pies against one anna and ten pies in 1903-04 and 1902-03. In Berar the total expenditure amounted to Rs. 15,166-11-1 against Rs. 17,325-3-9 and Rs. 18,036-11-10 in 1903-04 and 1902-03, respectively. The decrease is mainly due to the appointments referred to in paragraph 3 not having been filled up. The average cost of each successful vaccination was two annas and three pies against two annas and nine pies in 1903-04 and two annas and five pies in 1902-03. Hitherto the Berar establishment has been comparatively highly paid and was also unnecessarily strong. As the reorganization scheme referred to in paragraph 3 takes effect the difference between the average cost of successful vaccinations in the Central Provinces and Berar will become less and less. In the Feudatory States the vaccination charges amounted to Rs 7,336-3-4, practically the same as in the year previous; the average cost of each successful vaccination was one anna against one anna and one pie in 1903-04. Dispensary Vaccination (Statement III). 19. Hospital Assistants attached to dispensaries in the Central Provinces performed 17,687 vaccinations or 5,337 more than in the previous year and 26.81 more than in 1902-03. The largest amount of work was done in the dispensaries of Raipur, Narsinghpur and Saugor; the amount done in the dispensaries of Nimar, Chhindwara, Betul and Seoni was small. In the dipensaries of Nagpur, Chhindwara and Wardha no re-vaccination was done. The percentage of success in primary vaccination was 98.18 as compared with 95.79 in 1903-04 and 94.33 in 1902-03, while in re-vaccination it was 78.25 against 66.85 and 63.35 in the two preceding years. In Berar no dispensary vaccination work was done in previous years. A commencement was made in 1904-05, and in Amraoti and Akola 771 primary and 35 re-vaccinations were performed by Hospital Assistants ; the work will, it is hoped, be extended to the remaining districts in 1905-06. In certain of the Berar dispensary towns there appears to have been some disinclina- tion to impose this work on Hospital Assistants on the ground that they were already fully occupied or that they were not expert Vaccinators ; in my opinion they can well spare the time, and it is desirable they should become expert Vaccinators if they are not such already. In the Feudatory States Hospital Assistants performed 4,035 vaccinations against 3,756 in 1903-04 and 2,522 in 1902-03 ; in primary vaccination the percentage of succes was 96.26 against 97.80 in 1903-04; in re-vaccinations it was 90.65 against 90.08 ; the latter figures are abnormally high.

In the Central Provinces Civil Surgeons were 759 days on tour against 705 in the preceding year and 533 in 1902-03. They visited 7,118 villages and saw 86,730 primary and 7,641 re-vaccinations against 58,755 primary and 6,388 re-vaccinations in 1903-04 and 64,243 primary and 8,482 re-vaccinations in 1902-03. Of the total number inspected 89,140 were found to have been successfully vaccinated. More inspections should have been done by the Civil Surgeons of Chanda, Mandla
6 and Damoh; the Civil Surgeons of Nimar and Narsinghpur, on the other hand, saw nearly half of the total vaccinations in their districts. An Assistant Surgeon was deputed to Jubbulpore and another to Nagpur for inspection of vac- cination during the working season of 1904-05 ; in the Nagpur District the As- sistant Surgeon saw a large number of vaccinations; the Civil Surgeon of Nagpur will seldom be able to do any touring, but there appears to be no reason why the Civil Surgeon of Jubbulpore should not do a little when circumstances admit of it ; a closer supervision of the staff in his district is desirable. Native Superinten- dents, who were 3,095 days on tour, visited 17,673 villages and saw 212,593 per- sons (199,029 primary and 13,564 re-vaccinations), of whom 200,171 had been successfully vaccinated. In the previous year they saw 191,552 persons (176,801 primary and 14,751 re-vaccinations). In Berar, Civil Surgeons and Native Superintendents were on tour 218 and 777 days. The former inspected 15,045 primary and 830 re-vaccinations against 5,723 primary and 43 re-vaccinations in 1903-04, and the latter 46,228 primary and 2,289 re-vaccinations against 48,457 primary and 3,685 re-vaccinations in the preceding year. The decrease in inspections by Native Superintendents was due to there being no Native Superintendent in the district of Basim. Taking the Central Provinces and Berar together the percentage of success as verified by Civil Surgeons and Native Superintendents and as claimed by Vaccinators during the past two years was as follows:7 Mortality from small-pox as compared with proportion of persons protected by vacci- nation (Appendix B). 23. The annual mortality from small-pox was higher in 1904-05 than in the previous year, but lower than in 1902-03 and 1901-02. The annual ratio per 1,000 of population protected by vaccination in the Central Provinces was 42.92 against 39.24 in 1903-04 and in Berar 38.69 against 36.58 in the previous year. These figures are so far satisfactory. Owing, however, to the disturbing influence of plague in recent years it is tolerably certain that there is amongst the general population a larger proportion than normal of unprotected children and that consequently the vulnerability of the people in regard to small- pox is increased ; the history of small-pox during the past few months bears out this opinion, more especially in towns such as Nagpur. Deaths from small-pox during the past year have been most numerous in Bilaspur, Buldana, Raipur, Akola, Wardha and Saugor ; in the three former districts the protection afforded during the year was considerably below the provincial average.

The general results of the working of the Vaccination Department in 1904-05 are in my opinion satisfactory ; there has been a large increase in the amount of work done, combined with a remarkable absence of friction between the Vaccinators and the people ; the distribution of rewards to Vaccinators for good work has had a beneficial effect ; the recent improvement in the prospects of the Central Provinces Vaccinators cannot fail to lead to a similar result.

NOTES ON VACCINATION IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES AND BERAR FOR THE SEASON 1905-06. Population and area in which vaccination work was performed. The population and area in which vaccination work was carried on were 13,038,382 and 119,960, respectively. In this calcu- lation the population and area of the States transferred from Bengal have not been included as no returns have been received from them. Vaccination Establishment. 2. The scheme for the reorganization of the Vaccination Department in the combined Provinces sanctioned by the Government of India in August 1904, was brought into force during the year. Owing to the transfer of the Sambalpur District to Bengal, the Vaccination Establishment has been reduced by 10 Vaccinators and 2 Native Superintendents in the Khalsa; while the number of Vaccinators in the Feudatory States was reduced by 29. The strength of the Vaccination Estab- lishment of the Feudatory States transferred from Bengal is not known. In other respects the establishment was the same as in the previous year except that two Municipal Vaccinators were entertained in Nagpur, 1 in Jubbulpore, and 1 Zamindari Vaccinator in Chanda. The one appointment which was vacant in Berar in the previous year has also been filled up. Total number of operations performed in the Khalsa and Feudatory States. (Statement I.) 3. To facilitate comparison of the work done in the two years 1904-05 and 1905-06, the work done in the areas transferred to Bengal has been excluded from the total of 1904-05, and similarly the work done at places which do not appear in the statements for 1904-05 has been excluded from the total of 1905-06. With this proviso, the total number of operations performed by Vac- cinators and Hospital Assistants in the Central Provinces (including Feudatory States) and Berar during the year under review was 625,848, or 28,671 more than in the previous year. Primary vaccinations numbered 551,050 against 540,187 and re-vaccinations 74,798 against 56,990 during the previous season. Thus there is an increase of 10,863 in the former and of 17,808 in the latter, the per- centage of success in primary being 97.21 and in re-vaccination 64.89. The average number of operations performed by each Vaccinator was 2,089. 4. The number of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population was 44.81 against 42.83 in the previous year. Bearing in mind the prevalence of plague in many parts of the Provinces, the protection given must be considered satisfactory. Total number of operations performed in the Central Prov- inces and Berar. 5. The total number of persons vaccinated in the Khalsa (including dis- pensary vaccination) was 559,153 as compared with 539,516 in the previous year. Of this total 123,322 are credited to Berar. The increase occurred both under the heads primary and re-vaccinations. Compared with the year 1904-05 the increase was 5,875 in the former and 13,762 in the latter. Total number of operations performed by Provincial Vac- cinators. 6. The total number of vaccinations performed in the Khalsa was 534,277 as compared with 522,329 in the preceding year, being an increase of 11,948. Of this increase 311 were primary and 11,637 re-vaccinations. The average number of vaccinations performed by each Vaccinator was 2,120 and the percentage of success 97 70, the corresponding figures for the previous year being 2,115 and 97.49, respectively. Increase or decrease in pri- mary vaccinations in different districts. 7. Owing to the transfer of the Sambalpur District to Bengal and the formation of the new district of Drug and to the recon- stitution of the districts of Raipur, Bilaspur, Amraoti, Akola, Yeotmal and Buldana, no comparison of the work done in any of these districts can be made with that performed in them during the previous year. The total number of operations performed in them shows an increase of 4,649 as compared with 1904-05. Of the remaining 15 districts 8 show an increase and 7 a decrease. The increase varied from 35 in Mandla to 2,918 in Jubbulpore and the decrease from 247 in Narsinghpur to 3,641 in Nagpur.
2 The increase in primary vaccinations is attributed to the high birth-rate of the year. Good work was done in the districts of Jubbulpore, Balaghat and Bhandara. The marked decrease in Nagpur District was chiefly due to plague and to a rather severe epidemic of small-pox during the season, which greatly interfered with vaccination. The decreases in Hoshangabad, Nimar, Betul and Chhindwara are considered to be due to the low birth-rate and to heavy mortality among children in these districts. Children under one year of age available for vaccination and the number successfully vaccinated in the Khals 8. Of 354,318 children under one year available for vaccination (that is, the total births less deaths under one year in 1905-06) 380,933 were successfully vaccinated. The excess represents those who were born during the first quarter of the year 1905, but who were left unprotected during 1904-05 on account of their tender age, as well as new arrivals from outside. Re-vaccination in Khalsa 9. Re-vaccinations show a considerable increase during the year under report, the number having risen from 53,663 in 904-05 to 67,425 in 1905-06, an excess of 13,762 : the number of successful cases being 42,341, and the percentage of success 61.24, or an increase of 5.02 over that of the previous year. The increase is the result of efforts made to induce people to get themselves re-vaccinated assisted in some districts by the prevalence of small-pox. Of the total number (67,625) re-vaccinatied, 33,880 were adolescents and 33,745 adults. Primary and re-vaccination in Feudatory States. 10. The total number of primary vaccinations performed in the Feudatory States was 59,322 against 54,334 in the previous year, and of re-vaccinations 7,373 against 3,327, being an in- crease of 4,988 in the former and of 4,046 in the latter. The percentage claimed by the vaccinators was 96.81 in primary vaccinations and 84.03 in re-vaccinations against 97.09 and 85.75 respectively, in the preceding year. Expenditure on vaccination. (Statement II.) 11. As compared with the previous year there was an increase of Rs. 3,998-4-0 in the total cost of the Provincial Vaccination Department, due mainly to promotion of the members of the Vaccination Department of the Central Provinces in consequence of the reorga- nization of the Department, to the entertainment of additional men and to the increase of travelling allowance charges, and also to the extra cost incurred in connection with the manufacture of glycerinated lymph. The average cost of each successful case was two annas against one anna and eleven pies. In the Feudatory States the vaccination charges amounted to Rs. 4,749-15-1 or Rs 306-6-9 more than in 1904-05. The average cost of each successful case was one anna and three pies against one anna and four pies in the preceding year. Dispensary Vaccination (Statement III.) 12. There was an incr ase of 8,489 in the total number of operations perform- ed by Hospital Assistants, including Hospital Assistants in the Feudatory States. Primary vaccinations increased by 6,096 and re-vaccinations by 2,393. In the Khalsa the total number of opera- tions performed was 24,876 or 7,689 more than in the preceding year. Of this increase 5,564 were primary and 2,125 re-vaccinations. The percentage of suc- cess in primary vaccination was 87.31 against 93.95 in the previous year while in re-vaccination it was 64.18 as compared with 77.81 in 1904-05. In Drug no Dispensary vaccination was performed this year. The total number of operations performed in the Feudatory States was 3,624 or 800 more than in the previous year. Of the increase 532 were primary and 268 were re-vaccination, the percentage of success being 96.21 in the former and 80.25 in the latter, which is rather high. On the whole the work done in the States is satisfactory. Progress of primary vaccina- tion since 1896 (Statement IV) 13. Calls for no remarks. Inspections. (Statement V ) 14. No Assitant Surgeon could be made available for inspection duty in the Nagpur and Jubbulpore Districts during the year under report. In the former the Civil Surgeon could not go out owing to heavy work at head quarters due to plague, and in the latter vaccination inspection was carried out by the Civil Surgeon himself when possi- ble. Civil Surgeons and Native Superintendents were 761 and 3,094 days on tour
3 against 942 and 3,679 days respectively in 1904-05. The former visited 6,192 villages and saw 76,205 primary and 9,945 re-vaccinations against 94,421 primary and 7,530 re-vaccinations in the previous year and the latter visited 17,450 villages and saw 224,077 primary and 19,052 re-vaccinations, against 231,999 primary and 14,209 re-vaccinations in the previous year Of the total number inspected by Civil Surgeons and Native Superintendents 80,782 and 227,004 respectively were found to have been successfully vaccinated, the percentage of success as verified by Civil Surgeons being 96.51 in primary and 49.30 in re-vaccination, by Native Superintendents 95.17 in primary and 54.24 in re-vaccination. The decrease in inspection work was due to the change of Native Superintendents in certain districts, to the Civil Surgeon of Mandla not being able to go on tour in the month of March owing to the outbreak of small-pox and cholera in the town of Mandla and adjoining villages and to the Native Superintendent of Saugor being constantly required at head-quarter for supervision of the lymph depôt; this being the first year of its institution there. In the Feudatory State the work of inspection was carried out fairly well. 15. In the course of my cold-weather tours, I inspected 5,545 children primarily vaccinated in 1905-06. Of these 12 had five marks each, 2,843 four marks each, 1,378 three marks each, 1,107 two marks each, 152 one mark each, and 53 were unsuccessfully vaccinated. According to the practice in these Provinces hitherto, which coincides with the legal decisions on the point at home, all of these except the 53 who were failures 4 The use of glycerinated calf lymph has steadily increased, but the percentage of success was 93.14 against 96.14 in the previous year. 18. In Mandla and Chanda lymph was not manufactured at head-quarters owing to difficulty in getting a sufficient number of calves. The supply of lymph was therefore kept up by vaccinators by vaccinating calves in their circles. In Drug also glycerinated lymph was prepared in the interior of the district. In the rest of the districts, excluding the districts in Berar, glycerinated calf lymph was prepared at head-quarters. In Hoshangabad, Nimar, Raipur and Bilaspur it was prepared in the interior of the district as also at head-quarters as sometimes it was not possible to supply it to Vaccinators in sufficient quantity for want of calves. In Berar glycerinated calf lymph, manufactured at the Amraoti Paste Depôt, is supplied to all Vaccinators in the Province. But in the months of April and May as lanolinated lymph was found ineffective, owing to the heat, cow lymph was prepared and used in the Yeotmal District, while in the Buldana District lymph was obtained from Betul during the months of June and July. In the remaining months of the year the lymph prepared at the Amraoti Depôt was used. Vaccination in Municipali- ties. (Appendix A.) 19. During the year under report the Sambalpur Municipality was transfer- red to Bengal, and with the exception of Pulgaon in the Wardha District and Dhamtari in the Raipur District the Vaccination Act was not extended to any additional town. Of 23,523 children under one year available for vaccination 22,802, or 96.93 per cent., were successfully vaccinatedAPPENDIX. STATISTICAL STATEMENTS. PAGES. STATEMENT No. I.A.DEPARTMENT.

NOTES ON VACCINATION IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES AND BERAR FOR THE SEASON 1906-07. Population and area in which vaccination work was per- formed . The population and area in which vaccination work was carried on were 13,566,898 persons and 129,033 square miles respectively. Vaccination establishment. 2. The establishment of Nagpur District has been increased by two vacci- nators owing to the inclusion of the vaccinators working in the Kamptee Cantonment, while the establishment of Chhindwara was reduced by one vaccinator. In the Feudatory States two vaccinators of Udaipur, 7 of Sirguja, and 5 of Jashpur States have been included, while there was a decrease of one vaccinator in Bastar State. Thus during the year under report there was an increase of one vaccinator in the Khalsa and of 13 in the Feudatory States. The Vaccination Establishment in the province is about to be reorganized in consequence of the recent orders of the Government of India in their resolution No. 190-202 (Home Department) of 27th November 1906 Total number of operations performed in the Khalsa and Feudatory States.(Statement No. I.) 3. Work in the Department was very materially interfered with by the prevalence of plague The total number of vaccine operations, primary and secondary (including Dispensary vancination), performed throughout the province, was 617,381 or 8,757 less than in the previous year. Of this total 525,977 were primary and 91,404 re-vaccinations against 551,140 and 74,998 respectively in 1905-06, being a decrease of 25,163 in the former and an increase of 16,406 in the latter, the percentage of success in primary being 98.56 and in re-vaccinations 75.38. The average number of operations performed by each vaccinator was 2,058 or 31 fewer than in 1905-06, while the number of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population was 2.77 less than in the previous year. Total number of operations performed in the Khalsa. 4. The total number vaccinated in the Khalsa (including Dispensary vacci- nation) numbered 544,575 or 14,868 less than in 1905-06. Of this decrease 12,626 occurred in Berar. The percent- age of success in primary vaccinations was 98.68 and in re-vaccinations 74.71. Total number of operations performed by Provincial vacci- nators. 5. The total number of operations performed by vaccinators in the Khalsa was 523,532 against 534,277 in 1905-06, being a decrease of 28,492 in primary and an increase of 17,747 in re-vacci- nations. The average number of persons vaccinated by each vaccinator was 2,069. Increase or decrease in pri- mary vaccinations in different districts. 6. Compared with the figures of the previous year there was a decrease of 28,492 in primary operations during the year. The decrease was most marked in Jubbulpore (5,651), Wardha (4,984),Yeotmal (4,191), Bhandara (3,169), Amraoti (3,059), Chanda (2,076), Damoh (1,681), Narsinghpur (1,563), and Saugor (1,328). The great falling off is chiefly and I think correctly attributed to (1) the prevalence of plague and cholera epidemics ; (2) the withdrawal of vaccinators from their duty for employment on special epidemic duty on plague and cholera ; (3) sickness and mortality among vaccinators in common with the rest of the popula- tion. The districts which show increase in primary vaccinations were Buldana (1,013), Drug (793), Seoni (778), Raipur (456), Nagpur (445) and Chhindwara (141). 7. Three hundred and fifty-seven thousand seven hundred and eight-two children under one year of age were returned as available for vaccination, while 363,259 under one year were recorded as successfully vaccinated. The former figure was obtained by deducting from the total births in the
2 year the number of deaths under one year of age. The small excess of 5,477 probably in part represents immigrants and those who were not vaccinated in the previous year owing to illness or tender age; it is also probably owing to incorrect estimate by the operators of the age of the children being vaccinated. Re-vaccinations in Khalsa. 8. Re-vaccinations performed by vaccinators and Hospital Assistants in Khalsa were 17,747 and 264 respectively more than in the preceding year, the percentage of success being 75.22 in the former and 65.34 in the latter. There was a marked increase in Jubbulpore (4,392 , Bilaspur (3,237), Chanda (3,210), Chhinawara (3,111), Hoshangabad (3,092), Drug (2,098), Seoni (1,840), Raipur (1,710), Nimar (1,512), and Nagpur (1,365) ; while the districts showing a large decrease were Saugor (2,865) and Amraoti (2,068). The large increase in re-vaccination is attributable to special efforts made by Civil Surgeons to re-vaccinate as many person as possible owing to the severe outbreak of small-pox during the year. Of the total number re-vaccinated 34,876 were adolescents and 50,700 adults. Primary and re-vaccina- tions in Feudatory States. 9. The total number of primary and re-vaccinations performed in Feuda- tory States was 66,978 and 5,828 respectively, against 59,322 and 7,373 in the preceding year, the percentage of success being 97 67 in primary and 84.43 in re-vaccinations. Expenditure on vaccination. (Statement No II) 10. The total cost of the Provincial department amounted to Rs. 59,987-1-3 or Rs. 1,630-11-10 less than in 1905-06. The cost of establishment rose slightly from Rs. 50,707-2-6 in 1905-06 to Rs. 51,307-15-6 in 1906-07, while the expenditure under the heads &quot; Travelling Allowance&quot; and ''Contingencies&quot; fell from Rs. 6,308-3-8 and Rs 4,602-6-11 in 1905-06 to Rs. 4,472-15-11 and Rs. 4,206-1-10 in 1906-07. The average cost of each successful case remained the same as in 1905-06, viz., 2 annas. The slight increase in the cost of establishment is owing to the inclu- sion of the establishment of Kamptee Cantonment and to the promotion given to the Provincial vaccinators. In the Feudatory States the expenditure on vaccination was more than in the previous year by Rs. 525-10-2, but the average cost of each successful case, viz., 1 anna and 3 pies, was the same as in 1905-06. The increase in expenditure is due to the establishment of the Udaipur, Jashpur and Sirguja States being included for the first time. Dispensary vaccination. (Statement No. III) 11. The total number of operations performed by Hospital Assistants (including those in Native States) fell from 28,790 in 1905-06 to 24,032 in 1906-07. Of this number 19,162were primary and 4,870 were re-vaccinations, the percentage of success being96.96 in primary and 67.19 in re-vaccinations. In the Khalsa Hospital Assistants performed 21,043 vaccinations, of which 16,518 were primary and 4,525 re-vaccinations as compared with 20,845 primary and 4,321 re-vaccinations in 1905-06. The percentage of success claimed was 9,702 in primary and 65.34 in re-vaccinations. No primary vaccinations were performed by Hospital Assistants in Betul. The Dispensary vaccination in Feudatory States numbered 2,989 (2,644 primary and 345 re-vaccinations) or 635 less than in 1,905-06, the percentage of success being 96.63 and 86.66 in primary and re-vaccinations respectively. Progress of Primary vac- cination since 1897.(Statement No IV ) 12. Calls for no remarks.Inspections. Statement No. V ) 13. Civil Surgeons and Native Superintendents of Vaccination were 715 and3,056 days respectively on tour or 46 and 38 respectivelyless than in the previous year. The former visited 5,585villages and inspected 66,522 primary and 11,814 re-vaccations against 76,205
3 primary and 9,945 re-vaccinations in the previous year, and the latter visited 14,973 villages and verified 198,111 primary and 24,776 re-vaccinations against 224,077 primary and 19,052 re-vaccinations in the previous year. Of the total number inspected by Civil Surgeons and Native Superintendents 70,717 and 205,280 respectively were found to have been successfully vaccinated, the percentage of success verified by Civil Surgeons being 95.93 in primary and 58.37 in re-vac- cinations and by Native Superintendents 95.69 and 63.41 respectively. As in the previous year no Assistant Surgeons were available for vaccination duty in the Nagpur and Jubbulpore Districts during 1906-07. In Mandla the Civil Surgeon could not go out in camp for more than 24 days owing to sickness among European officers at head-quarters. In Akola the Civil Surgeon having had heavy calls upon his time at head-quarters his inspection was limited. He was however assisted in this direction by Assistant Surgeon Bhangay and by the Sub-Divisional Medical Officer, Basim. In Wardha, Chanda, Seoni and Yeotmal the Civil Surgeons were not able to do much inspection owing to the prevalence of plague. The decrease in the number of inspections by Native Superintendents was chiefly due to the outbreak of plague and cholera. 14. Of 2,878 children seen by me the percentage with five good marks was 0.07, with four good marks 54.69, with three 19.11, with two 21.61, and with only one good mark 3.41 : while 1.11 were failures. This means that 54.76 per cent of those seen were well protected and 19.11 fairly protected against the risks of small-pox : the corresponding figures last year were 51.48 and 24.85. Lymph cultivation in the Central Provinces and Berar. 15. The total number of calves vaccinated in the Central Provinces and Berar during the year was 3,914. Of these 3,426 were successful, 405 unsuccessful, and 83 were rejected for suppuration or excessive inflammation. The expenditure incurred in the Central Provinces amounted to Rs. 448-6-11 or Rs. 268-10-2 less than in the previous year. The expenditure incurred in Berar was also Rs. 66-1-10 less than in 1905-06. Operations performed with different kinds of lymph in the Central Provinces and Berar. 16. The different kinds of lymph used during the year 1906-07 and the number vaccinated with each kind were (1) fresh calf lymph 10,246, (2) glycerinated lymph 436,529, (3) human lymph 6,103, and lanolinated lymph 383. 17. Lymph was manufactured at head-quarters in all districts, except Drug, Chanda and Bilaspur, where it was prepared by vaccinators in their own circles. In Raipur it was manufactured at head-quarters and also in the interior of the district. In Berar the Amraoti Paste Depôt continued to manufacture and supply lymph. In January last the depôt being unable to supply sufficient lymph to Buldana fresh calf lymph was manufactured by the Native Superintendent there. In Amraoti the Civil Surgeon reports that great difficulty is experienced in getting a sufficient number of calves for vaccine purposes in spite of fees paid. To remove this difficulty it is under consideration to introduce the Central Provinces system of preparing lymph in each district of Berar. Vaccination in Municipalities. (Appendix A.) 18. The Vaccination Act was not extended to any town during the year. Of 24,307 children under one year of age available for vaccination 19,915 were successfully vaccinated. In the Municipalities of Khandwa, Burhanpur, Hinganghat, Arvi, Nagpur, Balaghat, Akola and Khamgaon more children than are shown as available were successfully vaccinated. This is due to the fact that children from outside the Municipal areas were brought in to be vaccinated. Probably also there is often an incorrect estimate of the ages of the children by the vaccinators. Mortality from small-pox as compared with proportion of persons protected by vac- cination.(Appendix B.) 19. The mortality from small-pox in the province was higher during the year 1906-07 than in any of the previous 10 years with the exceptions of 1896, 1900 and 1905. The proportion of persons protected by vaccination per 1,000 of popula- tion was 32.41 against 43.44 in 1905-06. The usual diagram is appended.
4 Cause of delay in submitting. 20. I regret that it was not possible to send this report to press by due date, 20th May, this is owing to the late receipt of the returns from the Feudatory States of the Chhattisgarh Division, the last of. which (from Jashpur State) arrived only on the 25th May.

CENTRAL PROVINCES ADMINISTRATION. Education and Medical Department. No. 19042 and outlying tracts. The Chief Commissioner indeed has grave doubts as to the accuracy of the returns sent in. The report itself contains figures which are at variance with those contained in the notes for the years 1905-06 and 1906-07 and for which no explanation is offered. In these two years the figures given in the notes of the number of children available for vaccination were 354,318 and 357,782 respectively, while in paragraph 8 of the report the figures are shown as 435,779 and 455,824. In both these years the notes showed that the number of children vaccinated were in excess of the number available. In forwarding the notes of the year 1905-06 to the Government of India the Chief Commissioner stated that he was unable to accept the explanation given for the excess in paragraph 8, and that it was evident that the returns must be incorrect, and that the most probable cause of their inaccuracy would appear to be that children of and over one year of age had been included in the returns of children under one year. But if the figures in the report can be accepted as correct it is evident that the number of children available for vaccination in the years 1905-06 and 1906-07 were grossly under-estimated when the notes for those years were written. Whatever may be the true explanation it is very clear that there is abundant room for improvement in the methods under which vaccination statistics are maintained and compiled, and the Chief Commissioner entirely agrees with the conclusion arrived at in paragraph 22 of the report that more extended and closer supervision is urgently called for. Inspections must be made real and effective and not treated as a matter of routine, while accuracy in maintaining and compiling statistics must be insisted upon. The subject is one to which the Sanitary Commissioner should give early attention in consultation with local bodies, through the Divisional and District authorities. The procedure for calculating the number of infants available is rough and unsatisfactory, and the Sanitary Commissioner should devise a better method of arriving at the average number of infants under one year in existence during the vaccination season. 4. The difference in the percentages of successful revaccinations in the Central Provinces and in Berar is very marked. The average for the four Central Provinces Divisions is about 85 per cent as against 38 per cent in the Berar Division and the lowest district percentage in the Central Provinces (61.56 for Hoshangabad) is considerably in excess of the highest district percentage in Berar (49.50 for Buldana). The subject was noticed when the notes for the year 1906-07 were under consideration, and on a report being called for, Colonel Weir, the Sanitary Commissioner, attributed these variations to three causes, viz., (1) the inferiority of the lymph used in Berar; (2) the superiority of primary vaccination in Berar; and (3) difference in the standard of judging success by the Central Provinces and Berar vaccinators. The second of these reasons cannot logically be reconciled with the first, for an inferior lymph would affect primary vaccination as adversely as it would subsequent vaccination. The difference would appear due to the use of inferior lymph in Berar and to a lax standard of estimating success in the Central Provinces. Measures have recently been taken to improve the quality of the lymph in use in Berar and what is required now is an accurate definition of what constitutes a successful revaccination and a uniform method of estimating it. 5. The use of glycerinated lymph is steadily increasing. During the trien- nium 3.19 per cent of the total number of operations were performed with fresh calf lymph, 93.81 with glycerinated calf lymph, 1.40 with arm-to-arm human lymph, and 1.53 with lanolinated calf lymph, as against 37.01, 53.14, 9.59 and 25, respectively, in the last triennial period. In the year 1907-08 as many as 98.62 per cent of operations were performed with glycerinated calf lymph, but the results compared unfavourably with other kinds of lymph. This was due to the inex- perience of vaccinators, especially in Berar, in preparing the lymph; but when it is prepared under proper supervision at head-quarters, for which arrangements are in progress, better results should be secured. It is satisfactory to see that the use of human lymph is generally being discouraged. 6. The transfer of the staff of vaccinators to the control of the local bodies is an experiment the success of which will depend largely on the interest taken by the local bodies in their new duties. The necessity for improving the prospects of
3 new entrants, now that these appointments are non-pensionable, is discussed in more than one district report. The question has already been referred to the Sanitary Commissioner for opinion and until his report is received it is not possible to indicate the lines on which the matter will be dealt with, but any proposals made with the object of securing an efficient and contented service will receive the most careful and sympathetic consideration of the Administration. The Chief Commissioner is of opinion that it is desirable to relieve Hospital Assistants of all vaccination work in Municipalities and this question has also been referred for the opinion of the Sanitary Commissioner The one thing certain is that the progress made in protecting the population from small-pox has not been entirely satisfactory, and that inefficiency among the vaccinators and insufficient supervision over them are largely responsible for the lack of progress. The report from the Mandla district, while unsatisfactory in itself, has the merit of throwing considerable light on the unreliability of some of the results claimed and the method of inspection which was followed by the Civil Surgeon might with advantage be followed in other districts also.

TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES AND BERAR FOR THE YEARS 1905-06, 1906-07 AND 1907-08. Cause of delay in submitting the report. The report was due in the Press on the 20th May, but was unavoidably delayed owing to non-receipt of returns from the Feuda- tory States of Sirguja, Jashpur, Korea and Changbhakar These have not yet been received ; so to avoid further delay this report is sub- mitted without them. Population and area in which vaccination work was perform- ed(Statement I.) 2. There have been considerable changes during the triennium in the po- pulation amongst whom and the area over which vaccine operations have been carried out. The Khalsa portion of the district of Sambalpur, with some of the attached Zamindaris and Feudatory States, covering an area of about 13,644 square miles with a population of 1,588,663 inhabitants, were transferred to Bengal, and five Feudatory States from Bengal2 Prevalence of plague in many parts of the province impeded the work during the past two years, and in 1907-08, by Government of India, Home Department, Resolution No. 1903 of the previous triennium when the average was 6,212. In the Feudatory- States, the figures were 1,855 in 1905-06, 1,485 in 1906-07 and 1,817 in 1907-08. Primary vaccinations 10. The primary vaccinations done by the Khalsa vaccinators during the triennium numbered 1,358,227 (470,973 in 1905-06, 442,481 in 1906-07 and 444,773 in 1907-08) against 1,304,641 (426,424 in 1902-03, 415,037 in 1903-04 and 463,180 in 1904-05) in the previous period, the excess over the latter being 53,586 Had it not been for the hindrances to the work already referred to, the increase would have been still larger, now that primary vaccination is becoming more popular than in the past save in a few tracts, which are very far from the head-quarters stations, where the Civil Surgeons cannot often go and where the conduct of vaccinators made vaccination unpopular. Excluding the districts of Chanda, Raipur, Bilas- pur, Drug and the four Berar Districts, whose statistics for the past triennium, according to their present area, are not available for comparison, six districts show an increase in the number of operations performed, and eight a decrease. The districts showing increases are Nagpur (10,932), Jubbulpore (7,665), Seoni (5,522), Saugor (5,291), Balaghat (5,043), and Hoshangabad (4,150). The In- crease in Nagpur and Jubbulpore is due to the entertainment of extra vaccinators. The districts showing decreases are Damoh (659), Betul (724), Bhandara (899), Chhindwara (1,169), Narsinghpur (1,792), Mandla (2,288), Wardha (4,823) and Nimar (5,179). The decrease in Damoh and Betul is ascribed to people leaving their houses in search of work owing to the prevailing scarcity, and in Bhandara, Chhindwara, Wardha and Nimar to the epidemics of plague and cholera. In Narsinghpur the Civil Surgeon attributes the decrease to opposition on the part of the people, but that this is the real cause is doubtful, as there is no reason for presuming that there is greater opposition here than in other districts : indeed the fact that the returns of Narsinghpur show that during the last triennium, 20,178 persons were re-vaccinated, the highest number for any district, with the ex- ception of Seoni, would point to a different conclusion. In Mandla, affairs seem to be in a very unsatisfactory state. The decrease is attributed to the conduct of vaccinators, who absented themselves from their circles and falsified their records. The Deputy Commissioner writes that work in the past years also was very bad which is evidenced by the large number of deaths from small-pox, and suggests the present low-paid vaccinators being replaced by better and highly paid men. It is doubtful whether this would improve matters; stricter supervision would probably be the most effective remedy, and I agree with the Commissioner that a second selected Superintendent should be posted to the district for a few years this, with the more immediate control of the District Vaccination staff now vested in the local authorities, will probably have a beneficial effect. In the Feudatory States, 56,103 operations were done in 1905-06, 64,334 in 1906-07 and 58,862 in 1907-08. The increase in 1906-07 is due to the inclu- sion in that year of the statistics relating to the Feudatory States of Jashpur and Sirguja, which, owing to the non-receipt of returns, were not included in the statistics of the other two years. Re-vaccinations. 11 Re-vaccinations by the District Establishment rose from 180,012 in the past triennium to 211,185 in the period under review, and in the Feudatory States from 9,533 to 17,209. Opposition to re-vaccination seems to be decreasing, but I think the prevalence of small-pox has been a potent factor in increasing the number. The largest number of re-vaccinations was done in Seoni (29,351), and Narsinghpur comes next with 20,178. Then follow Betul with 15,418 operations, Saugor with 15,205, Amraoti with 13,369, Jubbulpore with 13,125, Akola with 12,820 and Buldana with 10,056. The numbers done in Bhandara (1,900), Wardha (2,560), Bala- ghat (2,654), Drug (3,865), Nagpur (4,750) and Yeotmal (4,708) are not encouraging. The work done in Mandla (6,607) is very low considering the high mortality from small-pox which occurred there. Finance (Statement II) 12. The total cost of the District Vaccination Establishment, which was Rs. 61,617-13-1 in 1905-06, fell to Rs. 59,987-1-3 in the succeeding year, but again rose to Rs. 62,924-15-10 in 1907-08. This increase in the past year was due to compensation allowance paid to the staff on account of dearness of food-grains, to the inclusion of the pay of the vaccination tour khallasies, to the increased travelling allowance paid to vaccinators on account of their transfers as explained in paragraph 4 and to the erection of district lymph depôts in some head-quarters towns. Compared with the previous triennium, the expenditure during the past triennium, seems high
4 and is mainly due to the re-organization in the pay and prospects of the Central Provinces Vaccination Establishment. But notwithstanding this increase in total expenditure, the cost of each successful vaccination, which remained at annas two throughout the triennium, is not high. Compared with the year 1906-07, the proportion of expenditure, debited to Provincial Revenues in 1907-08, fell by Rs. 6,153-0-10. This is due to the transfer in October 1907 of the Berar Vac- cination staff to the District or Local Fund Establishment. The total expenditure in the Feudatory States amounted to Rs. 4,749-15-1, Rs. 5,275-9-3, and Rs. 5,005-7-6 during the past three years, and the cost of each successful vaccination remained at Re. 0-1-3 throughout the period. Dispensary vaccination. (Statement III) 13. Hospital Assistants attached to Government and Local Fund Dis- pensaries performed 67,117 operations (55,607 primary and 11,510 re-vaccinations) against 40,836 (36,713 prim- ary and 4,123 re-vaccinations) during the preceding triennium. Of the primary operations done during the past three years, 49,885 were returned as successful, giving a ratio per cent of 87.36 in 1905-06, 97.02 in 1906-07 and 95.57 in 1907-08, which is less than the percentage claimed by the vaccinators. The percentage of success claimed by Hospital Assistants is always lower than that claimed by vaccinators: the former are presumably not less skillful than the latter and both use the same lymph. The explanation is that the returns of the vaccinators are not as correct as that of the Hospital Assistants, who do not falsify their records, while this is not the case with vaccinators whose records of remote and out-of- the-way tracts are seldom or never inspected. The same feature is noticable in re-vaccination returns also, where the percentage of success returned by vacci- nators was 75.22 and 76.12 in 1906-07 and 1907-08, respectively, while the success claimed by Hospital Assistants amounted to 65.34 and 66.62, respec- tively In the Feudatory States 8,583 primary and 1,146 re-vaccinations were done by Hospital Assistants, against 7,093 and 311, respectively, in the preceding triennium, the percentage of success being 96.21, 96.63 and 96.99 in primary, and 80.25, 86.66 and 93.03 in re-vaccinations during the three years of the past triennium. The latter figures are abnormally high Progress of primary vacci- nations since 1898.(Statement IV) 14. The primary vaccinations done by vaccinators paid from Provincial Revenues have much decreased in 1907-08, with corre- sponding increase in the number performed by Local Fund vaccinators. This is due to the transfer in October 1907 of the Berar Vaccination Establishment to Local Bodies. Inspection of vaccination (Statement V ) 15. During the year 1907-08, Civil Surgeons were 786 days out on tour and inspected 73,301 primary and 10,450 re-vaccinations in 6,632 villages, the proportion per cent of inspections to total number vaccinated being 15.83 for primary and 15.04 for re-vaccinations. Though the work done seems more than in the year previous, when 66,522 (or 14.41 percent) primary and 11,814 (or 13.80 per cent) re-vaccinations were inspected, this is not a sufficient amount of supervision to be exercised over a poorly paid staff, whose conduct in many cases was found to have been otherwise than satisfactory, nor does the usual method of inspection by Civil Surgeons give a true insight into the amount or quality of the work done A better opinion regarding the efficiency of the vaccinator, and the amount of protection afforded by the vaccine operations performed by him, could be formed if the commendable method of inspection adopted by Captain McGillivray, Civil Surgeon of Mandla, was followed and surprise visits were paid to the villages in the absence of the vaccinators. Formerly, in accordance with the custom, which now obtains in most districts, the Superintendent and vaccinators were informed of the route of inspection and children were collected at different points on the route; though this method allowed of more children being inspected, it gave no idea of the percentage of population protected, or the number of villages visited by the vaccinator This year Captain McGillivray paid surprise visits to 126 villages, off the main road without informing the vaccinators, and found that, while in 1906-07, 128 villages showed over 1,000 vaccinations, in 1907-08, 126 villages (practically the same number) showed only 283 vaccinations and in many of the villages no vaccinations had been performed at all. The Superintendents of Vaccination were out on tour for 3,173 days against 3,056 in the previous year, visited 17,820 villages against 14,973, and inspected 45.95 per cent of the primary and 30.00 per cent of the re-vaccinations, against 43.16 and 28.95, respectively, in 1906-07. In their cases also the amount of inspection work done was small. At least 60 per cent of the vaccinated children should be inspected to ensure a fair amount of check on the work of the staff
5 The work done by the Superintendent at Wardha is very satisfactory. He inspected 84.69 per cent of the primary vaccinations done. A good amount was also done in Raipur (67.51 primary and 43.53 re-vaccinations), Nimar (66.17 primary and 61.23 re-vaccinations) and Balaghat (59.84 primary and 36.21 re-vaccinations). In the rest a fair amount was done except in Mandla, Seoni, Betul, Nagpur, Chanda, Amraoti and Akola, where it was low. The attention of the Civil Surgeons will be drawn to this. In the Feudatory States, no inspec- tions were done by Medical Officers except in Chhuikhadan where the Civil Surgeon, Drug, inspected 79 primary vaccinations. The work of Superintendents also is very low (27.59 per cent of primary and 30.52 of re-vaccinations). In fact in many of the States there are no regular Superintendents to check the work of the staff and exercise supervision over them. Verification of vaccination. 16. The percentage of success, as verified by Civil Surgeons and Superinten- dents, and as returned by vaccinators in the Central Provinces and Berar (excluding Feudatory States) during the past three years, was as follows :6 this lymph. Glycerinated calf lymph only was used in all districts except in Raipur and Drug, where, in addition to glycerinated calf lymph, vaccination from arm-to-arm, direct from the calf and with lanoline lymph was also practised, and in Yeotmal where lymph direct from the calf was also used. The percentage (as shown by the figures which are not always to be depended on) of success obtained from the use of glycerinated lymph compares unfavourably with that of other lymphs used. It may be due to inexperience in preparing it on the part of the Vaccination staff, especially in Berar. Now that the Paste Depôt at Amraoti has been abolished, and Civil Surgeons are obliged to cultivate their own supply in different parts of the district, in the absence of a suitable building at head-quarters for housing calves, etc., such results must be expected. In some districts in the Central Provinces suitable buildings have been erected and arrangements are being made to increase the number, and when this is done and when lymph is prepared by trained men at head-quarters, it is hoped that better results will follow. Arm-to-arm vaccination will be discouraged as for many reasons it is not a desirable method. The compulsory Vaccina- tion Act and vaccination in municipal towns. Appendix A. 20 During the period under review, the provisions of the Vaccination Act were extended to only two towns, Pulgaon in War- dha and Dhamtari in Raipur, and one (Sambalpur) in which the Act was in force was transferred to Bengal. Out of the existing 59 municipalities, the Act is in force in 50. The total births in all these towns were 35,820 in 1907-08. Deducting deaths among children under one year of age, the number available for vaccina- tion was 24,936, of which 22,911 or 91.88 per cent were successfully vaccinated. In many of the towns more children than are shown as available were success- fully vaccinated. This may be due to vaccinating children, who were left out the year previous, and to people, who had come from other places for work during the prevalence of scarcity bringing their children with them, and also probably to incorrectly estimating the ages of the children, who were vaccinated and of those who died. A very low percentage (17.85) was done in the newly-formed municipality of Malkapur in the Buldana District, and the Civil Surgeon attributes this to plague and the absence of the vaccinator. In Buldana, Ramtek, Pan- dhurna, Chanda, Mandla, Warora, Deoli, Balaghat, Dhamtari, Wardha, Chhind- wara, Ellichpur, Badnur, Pulgaon, Seoni, Jubbulpore City, Saoner, Bilaspur and Gadarwara many children were left unprotected. In many of these the Vaccination Act is in force, but closer supervision is necessary and Civil Surgeons will be asked to provide for this. The provisions of the Act might well be extended to the remaining towns, and in all smaller Dispensary towns Dispensary vaccination should be enforced and the Hospital Assistants and the local Magistrates held responsible In several instances the Honorary Magistrates, in whose Courts cases of obstruction to vaccination were committed, delayed disposing of them so long that the season was over, children were sent away and nothing could be done It would be well if a few persons were dealt with in a summary and exemplary manner, and I agree with Mr. Fox-Strangways that a few chosen cases might be tried by the Deputy Commissioner himself, or if the Honorary Magistrate persistently neglects his duty another Magistrate might be appointed. Deaths from small-pox com- pared with the proportion of persons protected by vaccina- tion Appendix B 21. The mortality from small-pox in 1907-08 was 5,285 or 0.44 per mille of population as compared to 0.87 and 0.58 per mille, the figures for 1905-06 and 1906-07, respectively, and the proportion of persons protected by vaccination was 41.32 per mille of population against 41.83 in 1906-07 and 43.44 in 1905-06. The figures seem fairly satisfactory, but the prevalence of plague in recent years has much retarded vaccination work and there are many left unprotected, hence the mortality from small-pox is sometimes high. The deaths from this cause during the past year were numerous in Mandla, Seoni, Balaghat, Raipur, Bilaspur and Drug, in all of which except Seoni and Bilaspur, the proportion per mille of persons protected by vaccination was below the Provincial average. The increase in Seoni and Bilaspur is unaccountable, except on the assumption that the returns submitted by vaccinators in the past have not been correct and the protection afforded is not as extensive as would appear from the statistical returns Major Rainier has collected some interesting statistics during the recent prevalence of small-pox in the Chhindwara District. He received reports of 231 cases, of whom 181 were vaccinated and 50 unvaccinated. Of the former, 33 died, giving a death ratio of 18.23 per cent, and of the latter 19 died, with a death ratio of 38.00 per cent. The statistics are no doubt unreliable, as he says that from some villages only the deaths were reported without the attacks,
7 but in spite of such inaccuracies, the evidence is greatly in favour of vaccination. The Civil Surgeon of Chanda also has collected similar statistics. Of the 684 attacks reported, 552 were vaccinated and 132 were not. Of the former, 19 died, the ratio being 3.44 per cent and of the latter, 41 died, giving a ratio of 31.06 per cent. General Remarks. 22. It is yet too soon to form an opinion as to the improvement or otherwise which will result from transferring the administrative control of the Vaccinating staff to the District Local Boards. The re-distribution of the different grades of vaccinators, rendered necessary by this administrative change, interfered to some extent in 1907-08 with vaccination work already hindered as it was by the presence of plague throughout the triennium ; nevertheless, under existing conditions, the work done may be considered to be fairly satisfactory though there is evidence to prove that more extended and closer supervision is very necessary and desirable. This remark, however, must not be considered as adversely criticizing the supervision now exercised by Civil Surgeons, as it has long been recognized that it is impossible for Civil Surgeons, owing to the numerous other duties they have to perform, to efficiently supervise vaccination in their districts.

CENTRAL PROVINCES ADMINISTRATION. Education and Medical Department. FROM LT.-COL. R. P. COLOMB, I. A., SECOND SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, HOME DEPARTMENT. Nagpur, the 13th July. 1909. SIR, * With one spare copy. I am directed to submit herewith a copy * of the notes on Vaccination in the Central Provinces for the season 1908-09, and to say that the work will be reviewed when the Report for the triennial period 1908-09 to 1910-11 is dealt with. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, R. P. COLOMB, Second Secretary. Govt. Press, Nagpur :NOTES ON VACCINATION IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES AND BERAR FOR THE SEASON 1908-09. Population and area in which vaccination work was done. The population and area in which vaccination work: was performed were the same as in 1907-08. Vaccination establishment. 2. The number of Assistant Superintendents (formerly &quot; Native Superin- tendents&quot;) in both the Khalsa and the Feudatory States remained unaltered. There was an increase of two vac- cinators in the Khalsa and of one each in the Feudatory States of Bastar and Raigarh. Returns having been received from the Native States of Jashpur, Sirguja and Korea, 14 vaccinators have been added to the list. Total number of operations performed in the Khalsa and Feudatory States. STATEMENT I. 3. The total number of operations performed in the Khalsa and the Feuda- tory States, including Dispensary vaccination, rose from 599,247 in 1907-08 to 639,647 in 1908-09; of these 559,098 (480,429 primary and 78,669 re-vaccinations) were done in the Khalsa and the remaining 80,549 (73,009 primary and 7,540 re-vaccinations) in the Native States. The increase is attribut- able partly to the inclusion of the statistics of the Feudatory States of Jashpur, Sirguja and Korea, and partly to the good work done by some of the vaccinators in the districts of Jubbulpore, Yeotmal, Akola, Buldana, Saugor and Nimar. Of the 480,429 primary vaccinations, 379,258 were successfully performed on infants under one year of age, the number &quot;available for vaccination &quot; (calculated according to the instructions conveyed in Government of India No. 1299, dated the 7th May 1900) being 453,295. This shows that 83.67 per cent of the available infants were successfully vaccinated. Work done by vaccinators. 4. The total number of vaccinations performed by vaccinators in the Khalsa amounted to 537,941 (462,134 primary and 75,807 re-vac- cinations ) against 511,603 (444,773 primary and 66,830 re-vaccinations) in 1907-08, or an increase of 26,338 ( 17,361 primary and 8,977 re-vaccinations ). The districts contributing towards the increase are Mandla (+6,029), Jubbulpore (+4,399), Akola (+4,336), Buldana (+4,046), Yeot- mal (+3,767), Saugor (+2,829), Nimar (+2,152), Raipur (+1,980), Damoh (+1,665), Bhandara (+1,665), Drug (+1,272), Seoni (+1,200), Amraoti (+1,079), Betul (+736), Narsinghpur (+468), and Chanda (+57). The largest decrease occurred in Bilaspur district where the fall was as much as 4,383, which the Civil Surgeon attributes to the lazy conduct of the staff and to emigra- tion of people to other parts of the Province in search of livelihood owing to the prevailing scarcity in the district. The other districts showing a decrease are Nagpur (-3,099), Wardha (-2,666), Chhindwara (-738), Hoshangabad (-448), and Balaghat (-8). The Civil Surgeons of Wardha, Chhindwara and Hoshangabad attribute the decrease to bad work on the part of some of the vac- cinators, who have since been dismissed, and the Civil Surgeon of Nagpur to the work not having been taken up by the Hospital Assistants attached to the newly opened dispensaries till the close of the year. I am not inclined to agree with the explanation offered by the Civil Surgeon of Nagpur. I attribute the decrease in Nagpur and in Bilaspur to imperfect supervision and the consequent laziness of the staff. Of course the Civil Surgeon of Nagpur is very much tied up by his work at head-quarters. It will be necessary to increase the number of Assistant Superintendents in both the districts named I am glad to note a dis- tinct improvement in Mandla, where the work was very unfavourably commented on last year. This is no doubt due to stricter supervision by the Civil Surgeon. In Feudatory States the total number of operations performed by vaccinators. was 76,131, against 63,620 during the preceding year. Primary vaccinations. 5. There was an increase of 17,361 in the number of primary vaccinations by the Provincial vaccinators as compared with 1907-08. The increase was most marked in Buldana (+5,966), Mandla (+4,721) and Yeotmal (+4,009). As already explained in paragraph 4
2 the chief decreases occurred in Bilaspur (-5,771), Wardha (-2,550) and Nagpur (-2,219). Re-vaccinations 6. Re-vaccinations increased by 8,977. The districts of Akola, Jubbulpore, Nimar, Seoni, Bilaspur, Mandla, Saugor, Raipur, Nar- singhpur, Betul and Bhandara show an increase and the other districts a decrease. Finance. STATEMENT II. 7. The expenditure on vaccination in the Khalsa rose from Rs. 62,924-15-10 in 1907-08 to Rs. 65,994-0-7 in 1908-09. The increase occurred in the pay of the establishment, on account of compensation paid to them for dearness of grain and of the appoint- ment of 2 additional vaccinators. The average cost of each successful case was 2 annas, the same as in the previous year. In Feudatory States the total cost rose from Rs. 5,005-7-6 to Rs. 6,488-3-4 and the average cost per successful case from Re. 0-1-3 to Re. 0-1-4. The increase is chiefly due to the inclusion of the pay of the staff working in the 3 States of Jashpur, Sirguja and Korea. Dispensary vaccination. STATEMENT III. 8. 18,295 primary and 2,862 re-vaccinations were performed by Hospital Assistants attached to Provincial Dispensaries against 18,244 and 2,664, respectively, in 1907-08. The per- centage of success was 97.42 in primary and 54.07 in re-vaccinations. At the Feudatory States Dispensaries 4,418 operations (3,904 primary and 514 re- vaccinations) were performed, as compared with 3,116 (2,720 primary and 396 re-vaccinations) in the preceding year, the success claimed being 97.29 in primary and 85.71 in re-vaccinations. Inspection of vaccination STATEMENT V. 9. The Civil Surgeons were 831 days out on tour, visited 6,464 villages and inspected 14.50 per cent of primary and 15.97 of re-vaccinations during the year. In only very few instances were surprise visits paid to villages to ascertain the real amount of protection afforded by vaccinators, as suggested in paragraph 15 of the Report for the year 1907-08, and in paragraph 6 of the Honourable the Chief Commissioner's Resolution thereon. The Civil Surgeon of Nimar remarks that the system adopted in his district of writing on the back of the village form the names of the children left unvaccinated for certain reasons, and of vaccinating them at the vaccinator's subsequent visit to that village, works well. I am of opinion that, during the course of tours for the purpose of inspecting distant Branch Dispen- saries, surprise visits should occasionally be paid to villages situated at long distances from head-quarters. The time allowed by the rules for absence on tour is no doubt short: but the permission of the Deputy Commissioner or of the Commissioner can generally be obtained for a slight extension of the prescribed limit of absence. The Assistant Superintendents were out on tour for 3,238 days: they visited 18,600 villages and inspected 224,232 or 46 68 per cent of the primary vaccina- tions and 23,266 or 29.57 per cent of the re-vaccinations done during the year. A fair amount of inspection was done in Narsinghpur, Chhindwara, Balaghat and Raipur districts, but in others the work was not so thorough as it should be. In Saugor, Mandla, Betul, Nagpur, Chanda, Bhandara, Akola, Wardha and Amraoti the amount of inspection done was very small. None of the Feudatory Chiefs except Makrai and Chhuikhadan have sent in inspection returns. Percentage of success. 10. The percentage of success in primary vaccinations returned by vacci- nators is 99.10, against 93.76 and 93.38, the figures arrived at from the verification by Assistant Superin- tendents and Civil Surgeons, respectively, which indicate that the work done by vaccinators was satisfactory. But a close examination of the figures of Balaghat and Mandla indicates that while the vaccinators returned cent per cent of success, the verification by Civil Surgeons shows only 88.74 per cent successful in the former and 81.70 in the latter district. It is accordingly desirable that Civil Surgeons inspection visits should, as far as possible, be unexpected, leaving the usual method of inspecting to the Assistant Superintendents.
3 The percentage of success in re-vaccinations recorded by vaccinators was 74.99, while Assistant Superintendents and Civil Surgeons could only find 58.18 and 50.01, respectively. As the estimate of the success of a re-vaccination depends very much on the interval that has elapsed between the re-vaccination and the inspection, the results recorded by the vaccinators may be regarded as fairly satisfactory, though in some districts there is still room for improvement. Inspection by the Sanitary- Commissioner. 11. I inspected 3,298 children who had been vaccinated primarily during the working season of 1908-09. My locum tenens, Lieutenant-Colonel Crofts, I. M. S., also saw a portion of the work of this season, but no notes of his inspections have been left on record. Of those I saw, 1.9 per cent had six good marks, 0.4 per cent had five, 76.5 per cent had four, 11.1 per cent had three, and 8.3 per cent had two marks, while 1.2 per cent had only one mark and in 0.5 per cent there was failure. The protec- tion afforded in 1908-09 was therefore in my opinion 'good' in 78.8 per cent, 'fair' in 11.1 per cent, 'poor' in 8.3 per cent, and 'bad' in 1.7 per cent. I tabulate the corresponding rates per cent of protection found by me in the three previous years:APPENDIX. STATISTICAL STATEMENTS. PAGES STATEMENT NO. I.A.DEPARTMENT.

Population and area in which vaccination work was per- formed, During the year the Lower Taluks of Sironcha in the Chanda District, cover- ing an area of 539 square miles, with a population of 20,218 souls, were transferred to the Madras Presidency. The present area served by the Vaccination Department is 130,971 square miles and the population 13,601,341. Vaccination establishment. 2. The number of Assistant Superintendents (29) on duty in the Khalsa and Feudatory States remained unaltered. The Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner has sanctioned the number being increased by five men to provide for better supervision in the Nagpur, Raipur and Bilaspur Districts. They will be entertained from October next, but ap- parently an additional Assistant Superintendent is badly required for Chanda also. As regards Vaccinators, the Khalsa returns show an increase of 27 men and the Feudatory States 3. The increase in the former is chiefly due to the inclusion of the 25 apprentices, who have hitherto been wrongly classed as peons and also to the Municipalities of Tumsar (in Bhandara) and Akola having entertained a separate vaccinator of their own. In the Feudatory States, Kanker and Korea increased their staff by one each, and the vaccinator of Changbhakar has been added to the list, as the returns from the State have for the first time been received and incorporated in the Provincial Report. Total number of operations performed in the Khalsa and Feudatory States. Statement I. 3. There has been a considerable fall in the total number of vaccinations per- formed during the year, both in the Khalsa and in the Feudatory States. In the. British Districts, the number fell from 559,098 in 1908-09 to 534,368 in the past year, and the average number performed by each vaccinator from 2,101 to 1,881, the chief causes contributing towards the decrease being (1) the discontinuance of vaccination by Sub-Assistant Surgeons, (2) low birth-rate in the Northern districts of the Province and (3) the wide spread epidemic of plague in some of the districts, especially the Southern and Western districts. The unusal number of marriages in February and March, which following as it did a year (Sinhast) in which marriages were forbidden, caused a considerable movement of people from place to place, and thus impeded the progress of vaccination during the past year. Had it not been for the energy of the Vaccination Staff, as stated by the Civil Surgeon of Saugor, the decrease would have been greater. In the Feudatory States the decrease amounts to 5,311. The chief fall, in Bastar, was probably due to the recent disturbances there. Of the 534,368 operations done in British Territory, 467,457 were primary and the rest re-vaccinations, the number of infants under one year vaccinated being 374,442. Work done by Vaccinators. 4. The total number of vaccinations performed by vaccinators in the Khalsa was 532,504 or only 5,437 less than in 1908-09, which shows that notwithstanding the impediments men- tioned, the staff worked energetically during the past year. The decrease occurred in Saugor (2 two men leaving only 5,202 to represent the work of the remaining six men. The Civil Surgeon, Amraoti, draws attention to the fact that only 80 per cent of the avail- able children are vaccinated so that there is a population of over 5,000 per annum growing up unprotected and this in spite of the very high average amount of work done,viz., 2,462 operations per man. It will be found, however, that the percentage of work in other districts is generally below this figure, and when the mode of cal- culation is considered and also the movements of the population, I doubt if an increase in the staff will solve the difficulty. In towns it is frequently found that the number of infant vaccinations is greater than would appear possible from a consideration of the vital statistics. There is no real paradox in this, for many women leave the towns for their accouchment and return later so that the births are registered elsewhere, while in other cases the vaccinated child dies within the year and so is not included in the number available. In one or two cases the cessation of vaccination by Sub-Assistant Surgeons is deplored as these men did excellent work and are eminently suited for it, but with the present District con- trol of the Department the new system is more uniform. The Civil Surgeons, Narsinghpur and Raipur, followed the example of Nimar in the matter of having the names of all unvaccinated children recorded on the back of the village form (with reasons). As this plan secures careful work and facilitates check, it would be well if it were generally adopted. There are many complaints of laziness, falsifying books and collecting children from distances all of which are in inverse proportion to the supervision exercised, which in many cases offers room for im- provement, A vaccinator is sometimes a most unapproachable person in his circle, and I think every vaccinator should furnish on the reverse of his weekly report a programme of the villages or locality he intends to visit in the ensuing week. Primary Vaccinations 6. Primary vaccinations by the District Staff numbered 466,693 against 462,134 in the previous year, the chief increase being in Bilaspur ( + 5,917), Raipur ( + 4,499), Bhandara ( + 3,130), Amraoti ( + 2,489), Chanda ( + 2,449), Balaghat ( + 2,331), Drug ( + 2,295), Yeot- mal ( + 1,490), and Akola (+ 1,013). As explained in paragraph 3 above, all the Northern and plague stricken districts show a decrease, except Nimar where the increase was very slight (36), and Akola, where the increase is perhaps due to the appointment of an additional vaccinator. In the Feudatory States, the number fell from 69,105 in 1908-09 to 63,981 in the past year due to the low work done in Bastar. Re-vaccinations. 7 While the primary vaccinations increased, re-vaccinations show a de- crease. 65,811 operations were performed by Vaccinators in the Khalsa area and 6,523 in the Feudatory States, against 75,807 and 7.026 respectively in the preceding year. Small-pox having been less prevalent during the year apparently accounts for the decrease. That this work is unpopular is well known, the labouring adult not unnaturally objecting to it, but that the difficulty is not insuperable is evident from the Seoni report, which shows 12,163 re-vaccinations, whereas Damoh, Wardha, Nagpur, Bhandara and Balaghat only return a few hundred. There can be little doubt that this admits of modification. Finance Statement II. 8. The total cost of the District Vaccination Establishment, which was Rs. 65,994-0-7 in 1908-09 fell to Rs. 61,184-6-10 in the past year. The decrease is noticed under heads &quot; Estab- lishment charges &quot; and &quot; Contingencies.&quot; The compensation allowance paid to the vaccination staff for dearness of food-grains increased the establishment charges in 1908-09 and the diminished number of vaccinations performed contributed towards the decrease in contingent expenditure in 1909-10. The expenditure under 'Travelling allowance' shows an increase over the previous year, but the figures under this head are quite inaccurate and misleading. Ordinarily the Civil Surgeons during the course of their tours inspect dispensaries, sanitation and vaccination, and the travelling allowances they draw cover all these three duties, hence it is not possible tor them to maintain a separate account of travelling allowance drawn for vacci- nation. In the Feudatory States, the total expenditure rose by Rs. 146-1-11, due to the entertainment of additional vaccinators at Kanker and Korea and to the inclusion in the returns of the pay of the vaccinator of Changbhakar.
3 Dispensary Vaccination. STATEMENT III 9 Under orders conveyed in Secretariat letter No. 5734 was 76.03 per cent, while Assistant Superintendents found 53.54 per cent and Civil Surgeons 47.64; this is probably often due to a long interval elapsing between the operation and the inspection, for the scar from the secondary opera- tion is evanescent. Inspection by the Sanitary Commissioner. 13. My predecessor, Colonel Weir, I. M. S., who held charge of the office of the Sanitary Commissioner till the 31st Janu- ary 1910, inspected during the course of his tours, 5,096 primary vaccinations and found that 0.2 per cent had 6 good marks, 0.1 per cent had 5, 80.2 per cent had 4, 10.4 per cent had 3, 6.7 per cent had 2, 1.8 per cent had only one mark, and in 0.6 per cent there was failure. The protection afforded during the year was, in my opinion, ' good ' in 80.5 per cent, 'fair' in 10.4 per cent, ' poor' in 6.7 per cent and ' bad' in 2.4 per cent. Judging from the figures of 1908-09 when 78.8 per cent were good, 11.1 per cent fair, 8.3 per cent poor and 1.7 per cent bad, I would say that the quality of work in these Provinces in 1909-10 has been satisfactory. There appears to be a lack of uniformity in the modus operandi in many cases which might be correct- ed with advantage. The result to be aimed at is that of obtaining two good cicatrices on each arm, but every conceivable variation in number and situation of the insertions is found due apparently to the whim of the vaccinator. Cultivation of lymph. 14. 3,466 calves were vaccinated during the year against 3,469 in the preced- ing year, and 3,078 were used as vaccinifers, the cost incurred being Rs. 498-8-7. There can be little doubt I think that the lymph for each district should be prepared at head-quarters under proper supervision. At present some lymph is manufactured in this way, some by the Assistant Superintendent, and frequently Vaccinators prepare their own. The question of a large Central depot for the Provinces is a more difficult one, but in my opinion every Civil Surgeon should take steps to build a suitable shelter for calves and have a small laboratory in which the lymph would be made on a system more in keeping with scientific principles.The present plan is most unreliable and cases of numerous undesirable complications are reported, though these are probably often due to soothing applications made by the mothers. Calves can always be obtained on hire at Re. 0-8-0 or Re. 1 each, and the number required is really not great (though it appears to vary enormously probably on account of bad management). In Nagpur for example 65 calves supplied 1,518 drachms of lymph from which 29,289 vaccinations were performed. The strain of lymph should be re-enforced by obtaining seed lymph from the Lister Institute as recommended by the Civil Surgeon, Yeotmal. The Deputy Commissioner, Hoshangabad, suggests a supply of calves from the Agricultural Department. I do not know if this would find favour in their eyes, but the matter will be put before the Department for consideration. Kind of lymph used and the success obtained therefrom. 15. Only glycerinated calf lymph was used during the year, and the success obtained therefrom was 94.27 per cent. Vaccination in Municipal towns and Vaccination Act. APPENDIX A 16. This statement has been prepared in accordance with instructions conveyed in Government of India No. 1798, dated the 2nd November 1909. In the Municipal towns there were in all 34,019 births during the year and 9,197 deaths among infants under one year of age. The infants under one year successfully vaccinated numbered 21,171. Many of the available children could not be vac- cinated owing to reasons given in paragraph 3. The Vaccination Act was ex- tended during the year to three towns5 (4) Large towns in Berar like Malkapur, should have the Act enforced. There are several suggestions for making vaccination generally compulsory and for teaching its uses in schools. In Berar, vaccination appears to be losing ground for it was once the best vaccinated Province in India, but now we find large towns averse to the application of the Act. If there ever was proof of its efficacy it is contained in these figures showing the small-pox mortality in Berar for two periods of 18 years, copied from Major James' book recently published, viz :APPENDIX.

No. 1871/VI-32-12 CENTRAL PROVINCES ADMINISTRATION. Medical Department. Nagpur, the 25th October 1911. READ2 village to village. When a Civil Surgeon, as in the Drug District, inspected an average of 15 villages a day, the people must be put to considerable trouble in coming from their homes to the various centres through which he passes and the fact that Chanda and Raipur, where this practice was specially forbidden, show most progress in vaccination, shows that such a system is unnecessary. In inspecting vaccination work, it is neither necessary nor desirable that the inspection should be limited to the work of the current year. Much good can be done by inspecting schools and checking the proportion of boys that are protected, by examining the children met in the village street and seeing how many bear protective marks, and by examining the children said to have been vaccinated in the previous year and ascertaining what has become of those who are absent. In fact, the object to be aimed at is to carry out vaccination with as little trouble to the people as possible, and to do every- thing to prevent its being unpopular. 3. Turning to towns, the Vaccination Act was in force in 48 Munici- palities in the Central Provinces and in 13 in Berar, and it is only in these 61 towns that vaccination is compulsory. The Chief Commissioner regrets to find that the number of children in these areas who escape vaccination is large, and as an instance of this he notices that no less than 113 children in the Muni- cipal Schools of the Wardha District were found to be unvaccinated. The duty of enforcing the Vaccination Act rests with the Municipal Committees, and the better enforcement of the Act is a matter requiring serious attention. 4. The system under which the lymph is prepared varied from district to district. In some districts it is prepared at Head-quarters at a district depôt more or less under supervision, while in others it is prepared by each vaccinator in his Circle The preparation of an aseptic lymph of the proper strength is a most important aid to successful and popular vaccination, and the experience gained in the Buldana District, where a cent per cent success was obtained with lymph imported from England, is, the Chief Commissioner believes, the general experience when good lymph is used In every other Province in India it has been found desirable either to establish a central depôt for the supply of lymph, or to arrange for its supply from the depôt of another Province, and the Chief Commissioner is not satisfied with the arguments advanced in favour of the present practice. He feels some doubt whether the sum of Rs 10,000 a year said to be spent on the central depôt of the United Provinces will not be found to include other items than the mere preparation of lymph, and before he can accept the decision to continue the present system as the best, the Sanitary Commissioner should examine that adopted in other Provinces further. There is no doubt that the supply of a really pure lymph of standard strength cannot be secured under the present system, and the increased cost of a central depôt would probably be worth incurring if it did away with the risk of septic lymph being used. 5. The transfer of the staff of vaccinators to the control of local bodies, which was effected just before the beginning of the period now dealt with, is reported to have been a success, and to have led local bodies to take an increased interest in vaccination. Complaints are made in some of the District Reports that the vaccination staff is underpaid and undermanned, and if so, it rests with the local bodies to remedy these defects, and Civil Surgeons should bring the matter to their notice.

Cause of the delay in sub- mitting the report. The 30 days delay in the submission of the report to the Press is owing to late receipt of some of the District statements and to unusual press of work in my office. Population and area in which vaccination work was per- formed. 2. During the triennium the lower taluks of Sironcha in Chanda District covering an area of 539 square miles with a population of 20,218 inhabitants were transferred to the Madras Presidency. The area now served by the Department is 131,025 square miles, with a population of 13,601,341, as against 131,564 square miles and a population of 13,621,559 in the previous triennium. Vaccination Establishment. 3. At the close of the last triennium there were 29 Assistant Superin- tendents (25 in the Khalsa and 4 in the Feudatory States) and 314 Vaccinators and paid apprentices (279 in the Khalsa and 35 in the Feudatory States). The number of Assistant Superintend- ents continued unaltered until December 1910, when 6 new appointments were created (2 each in Raipur and Bilaspur and 1 each in Nagpur and Chanda). With regard to Vaccinators, 2 new appointments were created in the Khalsa area in 1908-09, and two more in the succeeding year, making a total of 283 Vaccinators and apprentices in the British Districts. In the Feudatory States the number rose from 35 in 1907-08 to 51 in 1908-09, and to 54 in the succeeding year. The reasons for this increase have been given in the notes on vaccination for those years During the past year (1910-11), Raigarh and Jashpur increased their staff by one each, while in Sirguja one appointment was brought under reduction, the total number on duty at the close of the triennium being 55. Total number of vaccina- tions performed in the Khalsa and Feudatory States. Statement I. 4. The following table compares the total number of operations performed in both Khalsa and Feudatory States during the past six years:2 Primary and re-vaccinations done in the Province. 5. Of the total operations, 1,670,241 (1,449,023 in the Khalsa and 221,218 in the Feudatory States) were primary, and 233,126 (214,510 in the Khalsa and 18,616 in the Feudatory States) were re-vaccinations. Compared with the figures of the previous triennium, the former show an increase of 68,525, while there is a decrease of 7,924 in the latter. Percentage of success. 6. The percentage of success in primary vaccinations in 1910-11 was 98.71 against 98.78 in 1908-09, and 99.15 in 1909-10. The slight difference during the past year is owing to the fact that secondary operations are now taken into account, under orders conveyed in Government of India, Home Department, No. 175, dated the 29th January 1909. Hitherto it has been the practice to ignore repeated operations upon one and the same person. The slight variation in the percentage of success with primary vaccination from district to district is almost entirely due to the secondary operations. In the Nagpur and Chhattisgarh Divisions which return the highest percentage of success, the secondary operations were few, while they were numerous in the Berar Division, where the percentage of success is lowest. The return of results from the Feudatory States cannot be relied upon, ten out of the fifteen States give a cent per cent success in the primary operation. As the manufacture of the vaccine lymph used in the States is not under the close supervision which prevails in most of the Khalsa districts, where the lymph is specially prepared at headquarters, it is probable that 86 44 per cent of success returned by Sirguja represents the true proportion for all the Feudatories. The results said to be obtained with re-vaccination are also exceedingly unreliable, some Vaccinators take the slightest inflammatory local re-action as evidence of a successful operation, no signs of which exist some months later, at the time of the Assistant Superintendent's or Civil Surgeon's inspection. Akola District gives 31.31 per cent of the re-vaccinations as successful, in Yeotmal the figure is 44.17 per cent, whereas Mandla aspires to 97 85 per cent and Drug to 97 27 per cent. The total figures for the Khalsa for this operation are 72.92, and for the Feudatories 89.59. An endeavour will be made to secure some uniformity and accuracy in this matter Captain Fowler, I. M. S., advocates the operation being performed on the outer surface of the left forearm, midway between the wrist and elbow; out of 229 convicts operated upon by this method, the result in 186 was successful. Persons successfully vacci- nated per 1,000 of population 7. The number of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population, which was 42.66 in 1907-08, rose to 43.84 in the follow- ing year, but fell to 42 27 in 1909-10, due to the causes mentioned in paragraph 3 In 1910-11 it rose to 45.08. The protection afforded was, as usual, highest in Seoni (68.29 per 1,000). Next comes Chanda with 58.08, the increase in the supervising staff and the greater attention paid to vaccination has brought about a great improvement in this district; Mandla shows a protection of 55.15 per 1,000, Narsinghpur 54.87 and Betul 54.46. In the remaining districts the figure is less than 50 per 1,000. Plague greatly interfered with the work in Berar and all the districts, except Buldana, return a decreased protection figure. In Amraoti, it is 34.21 and Akola 34.33 per 1,000. The staff in all the Berar Districts requires strengthening. The Central Provinces figures compare favourably with those of other provinces in India, e. g., in the United Provinces the proportion is 27 45 (1909-10), and for India as a whole it is 35.55 (1909-10). Work done by Vaccinators. 8. The work of the Vaccinators was on the whole fairly satisfactory. The total number of operations performed by them in the Khalsa area during the triennium was 1,639,705 (537,941 in 1908-09, 532,504 in 1909-10, and 569,260 in 1910-11), i. e., 70,293 more than
3 in the previous term. In the Feudatory States, the number amounted to 225,637 (76,131 in 1908-09, 70,504 in 1909-10, and 79,002 in 1910-11) against 196,508 in the previous triennium; the increase during 1910-11 is, however, mainly due to the inclusion of the returns of four new States. Average number of persons vaccinated by each Vaccina- tor. 9. The average number of persons vaccinated by each Vaccinator in the British Districts was 2,008 in 1910-11, against 2,101 in 1908-09, and 1,881 in 1909-10. These figures, however, under-estimate the actual work done, as men in charge of the Lymph Depôts, Municipal and Cantonment Vaccinators and paid apprentices, all of whom perform fewer operations than the District Vaccinators are included in the average number. In Hoshangabad, Mandla, Damoh and Wardha the figures are low, being 1,559, 1,610, 1,519 and 1,335, respectively. In the Feudatory States the average per Vaccinator was 1,436 in 1910-11, against 1,306 in 1909-10, and 1,493 in 1908-09. For the whole of India during 1909-10, the mean number of operations per Vaccinator was 1,477. The number of children available for vaccination. 10. The number of children available during the triennium amounted to 1,427,235, of these 1,150,611 or 80.62 per cent were successfully vaccinated, the figures for each year being:4 This is a general statement, easy to make but difficult to prove; some Vaccinators certainly are wanting in tact and integrity, but as the district staff consists of only 7 men, they each have a very large number of villages in their beat, and if the fault were entirely theirs, the fact could hardly escape notice, and the opposition would not be confined to a few villages only. It is well known that the inhabitants of the more remote and &quot; jungly &quot; tracts of the Province are always amenable to vaccination and it is very rarely that complaints of opposition are received from Vaccinators in such places ; it is from the richer and better educated classes that real opposition is met with, a little help from the Tahsildar by way of enquiry from the objectors, has a great effect in pushing vaccination and lessening opposition. Every case of opposition reported by the Vaccinator of which no notice is taken means subsequently increased difficulty in carrying out vaccination in the area in question. No explanation has been offered for the decrease during; the triennium in the district of Betul, the Civil Surgeon remarks upon the difficulty experienced in carrying out vaccination among the large contingent (about 30,000) of labour- ers collected together for Railway construction. The Deputy Commissioner notes that these people resented Census enquiries and preserve the same attitude towards vaccination and are quite prepared to enforce their objections by violence. I have addressed the Agent of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway upon the subject. In the Feudatory States primary vaccinations amounted to 208,415 (69,105 in 1908-09, 63,981 in 1909-10, and 75,629 in 1910-11), i. e., an increase of 29,116 over the figures of the preceding triennium. Re- vaccinations. 12. Re-vaccinations by the Khalsa Vaccinators show a decrease of 1,430 during the triennium (209,755 against 211,185 in the previous period) due most probably to a diminished prevalence of smallpox during the years 1909 and 1910. During the period the largest number of re-vaccinations was done in the Seoni District (36,320), Narsinghpur and Jubbulpore follow with 23,806 and 20,038, respectively In the other districts less than 20,000 operations were done, Wardha and Balaghat returning very few. During 1910-11, while the Saugor staff are able to perform over 5,000 re-vaccinations, in the neighbouring district of Damoh only 344 are performed ; Narsinghpur does over 7,000, while Hoshangabad returns less than 1,000. Wardha comes out worst in this respect, only 131 operations being performed. The Chhattisgarh Division, the second largest in point of population, returns the smallest number of re-vaccinations, the Nagpur Division being very little better ; of the 5 districts of the latter Division, Chanda is the only one in which the figures are satisfactory. The Superintendents of Vaccination of these districts have now been asked to pay particular attention to this question. In the Feudatory States little or no progress has been made, the number (17,222) of re-vaccinations performed during the triennium being practically equal to that of the previous period. During 1910-11, the State of Bastar, is the only one which shows any activity in pushing this operation. Finance 13. The total cost of the district vaccination establishment which was Rs 65,994-0-7 in 1908-09, fell to Rs 61,184-6-10 in the succeeding year, but rose again to Rs. 62,284-3-6 in the past year. The increase in 1908-09 was chiefly due to compensation allowance paid to the establishment for dearness of food-grains. During the past year (1910-11) the increase has mainly occurred under the heads &quot; Salaries of Assistant Superintendents of Vaccination &quot; and &quot; Contingen- cies.&quot; Under the former the additional Assistant Superintendents entertained at Raipur, Bilaspur, Nagpur and Chanda increased the expenditure, while under the latter head the settlement of some charges outstanding from 1909-10, and the construction of a lymph depôt at Chanda contributed towards the increase. The salaries of Vaccinators and of the menial establishment continued the same as in the previous year.
5 The amount drawn as travelling allowance shows a decrease, but as ex- plained in the Notes for 1909-10, the figures under this head do not refer to vaccination only. The average cost of each successful case which stood at 2 annas through- out the previous triennium, as well as in the year 1908-09, fell to Re. 0-1-11 in 1909-10, and to Re. 0-1-10 in the past year. The average cost of each successful case for the whole of India during 1909-10 was 3 annas, while in the Bombay Presidency it was Re. 0-8-10 and in the Punjab Re. 0-2-11. In the Feudatory States, also the expenditure during the past year fell by Rs. 234, the chief decrease being noticeable under the head &quot; Salaries of Vacci- nators &quot;. The average cost of each successful vaccination also fell from Re. 0-1-6 to 1909-10 to Re. 0-1-3 in the past year. Dispensary vaccination 14. Vaccination by Sub-Assistant Surgeons attached to dispensaries was discontinued by order of the Hon'ble the Chief Commis- sioner and it is only in special cases, as during the pre- valence of small-pox, that a Sub-Assistant Surgeon is allowed to vaccinate. The cessation of dispensary vaccination resulted in the decrease of more than 43,000 operations under this head during the triennium, but this loss, how- ever, was more than made up for by the additional work of the district staff. The few dispensary operations that were performed during the past two years took place in Jails and in Railway institutions. Progress of primary vaccina- tion. Statement IV 15. Satisfactory progress has been made in primary vaccination by the Dis- trict Fund staff during the decade. The rate of progress in the Feudatories and Municipalities is slower, the lack of close supervision in the former and the dilatory application of the penal clauses of the Vaccination Act in the latter, is the cause of this retarded progress Inspection of vaccination Statement V 16. In 1910-11 Civil Surgeons were 731 days on tour, and inspected 69,066 primary and 11,479 re-vaccinations in 5,919 villages, the proportion per cent of inspection to the total number vaccinated being 13.78 for primary and 16.85 for re-vaccination. In many districts, the work of inspection was curtailed, owing to the prevalence of plague ; on the whole the amount of inspection was well up to the average, and in most districts there are signs of closer supervision of vaccination. Surprise visits are paid in greater numbers and the custom of collecting children from distant villages is dwindling, Seoni, Nagpur and Drug are exceptions, however, in these districts 19, 18, and 15 villages per diem, respectively, were inspected by the Superintendent which, of course, means that children from a number of surrounding villages are collected together at a centre. During the past year Assistant Superintendents of Vaccination were 3,585 days on tour, and inspected 260,254 primary and 22,535 re vaccinations in 20,302 villages, the percentage of inspection to total vaccinated being 51.93 for primary and 33.07 for re-vaccinations, against 48.13 and 28.52 in 1909-10, these figures compare favourably with those of other provinces in India, e g , in the United Provinces where the average percentage of primary cases inspected during the triennium 1905-08 is 31.22 per cent. There is, however, room for improvement in many districts, and more uniformity is called for, but an Assistant Superintendent's work should not be judged by the percentage of total vaccinations inspected by him, because the number of total vaccinations varies greatly from district to district. Also in the jungle areas as Mandla the same number of inspections cannot be looked for, as in the case of Nagpur, Wardha or the Berar districts. In the districts of Damoh, Mandla, Seoni, the inspection work was poor, the average number of children per diem seen by the Assistant Superin- tendents of these districts when on tour, was, in Damoh 35, in Mandla 55, and in Seoni 71, the figures for some of the other districts being, Jubbulpore 117, Bhandara 105, Nimar 86, Ako1a 67. An Assistant Superintendent of Vaccina- tion should be able to put in 150 days touring a year, and in a populous district he should inspect at least 11,000 operations yearly. I doubt the accuracy of the Drug figures, as 158 days were spent on tour a daily average of 136, or 21,707 children during the season were inspected.
6 The results of inspection in Bilaspur are poor, with four Assistant Superin- tendents only 26,267 cases were seen. A second Assistant Superintendent has only recently been appointed to Nagpur. The effect of increasing the supervising staff is shown by greatly improved returns from Chanda. It is suggested by the Civil Surgeon, Bhandara, and agreed to by the Com- missioner and Deputy Commissioner that an additional Assistant Superintendent is necessary for the district. This case as well as that of Yeotmal will be considered. In forwarding the district reports the Commissioner, Berar, notes that it seems clear that the Assistant Superintendents of Akola and Buldana have not done a full season's work. These remarks would also apply to the Assistant Superintendents at Betul and Hoshangabad. Verification of vaccination 17. The percentage of success claimed by Vaccinators during the past year was 98.92 for primary, and 72.63 for re-vaccinations, while the Assistant Superintendents and Civil Surgeons during their inspections found 98 38 and 98.81 in primary and 48.26 and 46.30 in re-vaccinations. Hitherto the percentage of success in primary operations claimed by Vaccinators was above 99, but owing to the fact that secondary operations are now taken into account, there has been a slight fall in the figure of success. In re-vaccinations the success recorded by the Vaccinators and that found by inspecting officers always varies for reasons explained in paragraph 12 of the notes for the year 1909-10. Inspection by the Sanitary Commissioner 18. During the last cold weather my predecessor Captain Stokes who held charge of the office of Sanitary Commissioner through- out the year 1910-11, inspected the village Vaccination of the Raipur and Bilaspur districts. In the former the work of 6 Vaccinators in 79 villages was inspected, the village records showed that 1,444 primary vacci- nations had been performed, of which 1,390 were stated to be successful; of these, Captain Stokes inspected 85 per cent, with the following result: 7 prepared from 126 calves at a cost of Rs. 92-4-0 in addition Re. I was paid to the owner of each calf. In Akola 68 calves were successfully vaccinated. Buffalo calves are more satisfactory than cow calves, as they yield about twice as much lymph, 50 grammes of crude lymph on an average, being obtainable from each calf. Most of the districts now prepare their lymph at headquarters, and there can be no question that this is the best arrangement, a close supervision can be maintained over the manufacture of the lymph, the district staff are kept in touch with headquarters and each vaccination result can be closely watched and checked by comparison, by relieving Vaccinators of the necessity of obtaining calves, it removes a frequent source of abuse and discontent in the interior of the district, it also lessens the temptation to perform arm-to-arm work and by the saving of time effected, it allows the Vaccinator to extend the scope of his operations. A provincial depôt has its drawbacks, among these are those of centralisa- tion, difficulty in obtaining the large number of calves required, and cost; the depôt of Patwa Dangar in the United Provinces costs Rs. 10,000 per annum, and charges local bodies, &c , for the lymph supplied. The Civil Surgeons of Chhindwara and Hoshangabad complain of the difficulty in obtaining calves for the headquarters' depôt. In Berar there is never any difficulty and my experience of vaccination in seven districts of the Province is that only occasionally an owner objects to lending a very young calf on account of the interference with his milk supply, on such occasions the Tahsil peon is often to blame, and if a small reward is given and concessions made there is no real opposition. The Civil Surgeon, Wardha, (in an excellent report) mentions that he has arranged to purchase a mechanical &quot; mixer&quot; and &quot; filling&quot; machine, so that the vaccine may be sent out in capillary tubes. It would be well for all the larger districts to obtain one of these machines, one of the best is that designed by Major J. Entrican, I M. S., Burma. The cost incurred in the preparation of lymph was Rs. 1,878-2-2, against Rs. 498 in 1909-10 and Rs. 1,065 in 1908-09. This increase in the expenditure is owing 10 this inclusion of certain charges carried over from the previous year, and to lymph depôt construction. Kind of lymph used and the success obtained therefrom. 20. In 1908-09, a few operations were performed with lanolinated lymph and fresh calf lymph, but during the past two seasons nothing but glycerinated calf lymph has been used, the success obtained therefrom being 96.01 per cent against 94.25 per cent in 1909-10. There is apparently no necessity for the sterilization of the lymph by the chloroform process, and in the German depôts, a 10 days contact with the glycerine admixture is relied upon as sufficient to kill off all extraneous micro- organisms. Vaccination in Municipal Towns and the Vaccination Act. (Appendix A). 21. There were 35,887 births in Municipal Towns during the year and deaths among children under one year of age numbered 10,641. The total number of children under one year of age successfully vaccinated in these towns was 22,531. In many of the towns plague retarded vaccination work, but in certain others work has not been at all satisfactory during the past year. Many children were left unprotected in the towns of Saugor, Damoh, Murwara and Mandla, not only closer supervision but strict application of rules is very necessary. The Civil Surgeon, Nagpur, comments very unfavourably on the work in Khapa, Saoner and Ramtek and it is recommended that the Act be extended to these towns.
8 During the year the Act was extended to two towns, Gondia in Bhandara and Malkapur in Buldana. During the triennium, in order to facilitate the working of the Act, several Municipalities have obtained permission to appoint the Medical Officer in charge of the Headquarter Dispensary, as additional Super- intendent of Vaccination. The Civil Surgeon of Amraoti (Colonel Buchanan) complains that Munici- palities are not allowed to employ Vaccinators on higher salaries than those laid down in Gazette Notification No. 1310, dated the 23rd December 1910, but there is a slight misunderstanding as there is nothing in these rules to prevent a Municipality paying what they like for a Vaccinator. Mortality from small-pox and persons successfully vacci- nated during the year. 22. Deaths from small-pox numbered 2,419 or 0.22 per 1,000 of population against 0.29 in 1909-10 and 0.69 in 1908-09 and the proportion of population protected by vaccination was 44 57 per mille in 1910-11, as compared with 42.08 and 43.40 in the two preceding years. Inspection of school children in several districts has shown that frequently a large proportion are unprotected, as the Department is now in the hands of the District Councils, who also control most of the schools, by representation at the Council meetings there should be no difficulty in remedying this state of affairs. A point I would lay stress upon is the vaccination of the children of gangs of wandering tribes, professional musicians and such like; these people are especially prone to skin diseases and small-pox,and as they wander from district to district they tend to spread the latter disease. A few years ago a severe epidemic of small-pox in Raipur was proved to originate in this manner. General Remarks 23. In the last triennial report it was stated that it was then too early to form an opinion as to the improvement or otherwise resulting from the transfer of the administrative control of the vaccinating staff to the District Local Boards. I think that there can be no doubt now that the change was a wise one, although the executive control is still, as there is no alternative, in the hands of the Civil Surgeon, and its efficiency entirely dependent upon the degree of supervision exercised ; there are many indications that the District Councils are beginning to realise their respon- sibilities towards vaccination and to take an interest in its progress. In order to secure more uniformity in procedure and results it would be advisable to have an up-to-date Manual of Vaccination for the Province. W. H. KENRICK, MAJOR, I. M. S., NAGPUR : Offg.
