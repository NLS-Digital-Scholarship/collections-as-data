KEPORT ON THE TEZPUR LUNATIC ASYLUM, 1877. No. 247S., dated Shillong, the 3rd June, 1878. FromA. C. C. DeRenzy, Esq., Deputy-Surgeon-General, Dacca Circle, ToThe Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam. In forwarding the Annual Report of the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum, I have the honour to submit the following observations, for the consideration of the Chief Commissioner. 2. From para. 4, and other portions of the Report, it is plain that the huts are 'exceedingly damp. The drainage works carried out by the Superintendent have lessened this evil to a considerable extent; but, owing to the nature of the soil, I fear that, without efficient sub-soil drainage, carried out in a still more thorough way, the site will continue damp to a degree very injurious to health. The soil is a red clay, which is very retentive of moisture. I think it would be well to have the site thoroughly sub-soil drained, and the arrangements for this purpose are very simple, and could be carried out by the lunatics themselves. All that would be necessary would be parallel drains about 5 feet deep, and from 15 to 18 feet apart, filled with broken stones to a depth of a couple of feet, and over the stones a soil made of equal parts of clay and river sand, or filled up altogether with stones, if plenty of that material be available. Deep open drains of the kind described in para. 16 of the Report are unsightly, and very apt to cause accidents, especially in an institution like a Lunatic Asylum, where the inmates are often so helpless. 3. I think the proposal to plant a belt of trees to the east and north-east of the Asylum, made in para. 6, is one that should be carried out at once. 4. With reference to the proposal made in regard to the construction of permanent buildings, I would suggest that, before any steps are taken in this matter, information should be obtained from other Provinces on the subject. The advice of Dr. Payne, the Superintendent of the Dullunda and Bhowanipur Asylums, and of Dr. Crombie, the Superintendent of the Dacca Asylum, would be very desirable, as they have had great experience En the treatment of native insanes, and are in other respects admirably qualified to advise |on the arrangement of a Lunatic Asylum required in a damp warm climate like that of I Assam. The question of the most suitable flooring is one of great importance. There can be no doubt, 1 think, that the floor should be made of some impervious material. The question of the amount of superficial and cubical space necessary, the amount and mode of regulating the ventilation and the lighting, the arrangements for filthy lunatics, for violent and noisy lunatics, the arrangements for personal ablution,these are some of the points on which I think information should be called for. 5. From the information given in paras. 18 and 19, it appears to me very questionable whether it is expedient to have a separate Asylum for Assam. It appears that there were only 20 admissions in the year, and there were no less than 13 deaths. The average population of the year was only 35'46. The cost per head of keeping up an Asylum for so small a number of insanes must always be very high, and the discipline and management of such an institution can hardly be kept effective and satisfactory, except at an inordinate expense. From No. i) of the Statistical Tables, it appears that the cost per head of the lunatic population for 1877 was Rs. 176-9-64, in which amount the establishment counts for Rs. 86-15-4. As I understand from the Report on the Lunatic Asylums of l^engal for 187(5 that the Bengal Government are willing to take charge of Assam lunatics lor an annual payment of Rs. 90 per head, I am disposed to think that, for the present at all events, that would be a better arrangement in every way,better for the Government treasury, better for the lunatics themselves. 6. From para. 27 of the Report it appears that nearly half the population of the Asylum were natives of other Provinces, chiefly Bengal. 7. From para. 39 it appears that the death-rate of the year under review was 36 per cent, of average strength, the death-rate for the preceding year being 34 per cent.
REPORT ON THE TEZrUR LUNATIC ASYLUM. Dr. Garden states the death-rate of 1876 at only 25&quot;8 per cent., but his calculation is based on the results of nine months only, whereas, in order to make the results of the two years fairly comparable, 1 have, in accordance with established statistical principles, calculated the death-rate of 1876 on three-fourths of the average strength, the Asylum havim? been opened for only nine months of that year. The average death-rate of the Bengal Asylums for five years ending in 1876 was only 12*28 per cent, of average strength. This is the only useful standard of comparison available. The population of the Tezpur Asylum is so small that the death-rates by themselves cannot be held sufficient to discredit the sanitary state of the institution, but, taken in connection with the table given at para. 41, showing the diseases that chiefly caused admissions, they make it almost certain that there must have been some radical defects in the sanitary arrangements. Eleven cases of dysentery and diarrhoea attended with five deaths in so small a population is an enormous proportion of that class of diseases. The dampness of the floors would probably account for a large share of it, but the prevalence of bowel affections is so commonly associated with two other conditions that it is not improbable they may have contributed to the effect. 8. I refer to diet and water-supply. The food allowance of lunatics is very apt to become the subject of peculation on the part of subordinates. In 1876 this was found to have been the case in the Dacca Asylum to a great extent, with the natural result, that dysentery and diarrhoea caused 42 per cent, of the total mortality among the males, and 27 per cent, of that among the females. Lunatics are unable to protect themselves against this form of peculation; the greatest watchfulness is therefore necessary on the part of the superior authority to prevent it. 9. Bad water-supply, too, is a very common cause of dysentery and diarrhoea, and from the description given of the Asylum supply it is evidently open to suspicion. The wells go dry in the dry weather. The inference from this fact is that the water is merely surface drainage, more or less filtered. It is probable that most of the drainage passes down between the steining of the well and the surrounding soil, without undergoing any* efficient filtration at all. But there is another source of pollution: the wells are, I believe, provided with covers, on which the people stand when drawing water, and the effect of this arrangement is that the drippings and washing of the feet and legs of the drawers must fall into the well, and thus, when the wells are nearly dry, the water must be a very foul poisonous compound. These defects have only to be explained in order to suggest the method of preventing them. 10. Dr. Garden's remarks on the need of more complete information being recorded on the forms of inquiry brought with lunatics on first presentation at the Asylum deserve attention. I fear it will be impossible to get much reliable information regarding the previous medical history of the lunatics; but on one point of considerable importance strict inquiry should always be made, and that is, whether the relations have or have not the means of contributing to the support of the lunatics. 11. I abstain from offering any remarks on the forms of insanity exhibited by the patients, and the age and sex of those affected. The facts recorded are as yet too few, and too unreliable, to admit of any safe conclusions being drawn from them. lines, per man iwo roc used as of com- 111 as a In not at; ordinal-fconipcl my an have bi

The situation of the Asylum, to the east of the station, about a quarter of a mile beyond the police lines, is, taking it all in all, about as good a one as could have been selected, with a view to convenience of access, as well as seclusion and quietness,elements so important in the management and treatment of those mentally diseased. 2. The Asylum is placed on an open plateau of no great extent, comparatively elevated, and beyond all chances of inundation, and lying about a quarter of a mile or less north-west of the low lands which border the Mora Borelli Uiver, and having to its north a patar, or ravine, by which its thorough drainage is secured. 3. The ground occupied is close to this patar, and slopes decidedly downward towards it, the highest point of the pleateau being in front of the Asylum precincts, and more or less occupied by a public, but comparatively little used, road. 4. The inconvenience of this position, on a slope and below the watershed of this individual spot was shown during the rains by the fact that the movement of the sub-soil water tended towards the potar through the Asylum grounds, so that, until large and deep drains had been cut, it was impossible, when once the rains had commenced, to prevent the whole Asylum compound becoming more or less in the condition of a swamp, and the floors of the huts extremely damp. After the large drains were cut, this swampy condition was remedied to a great extent, whilst the large amount of water that had previously drained through the Asylum was shown by the number of bubbling springs that continued to throw out water in the deep drains for days after a heavy fall of rain. One unfortunate result was that the floors of the huts became in most instances thoroughly-soaked, and it was found impossible, with the thin construction of the huts, to dry them, and two huts had to be abandoned as unfit for residence. 5. The soil, 1 may observe, is the common red clay soil of this part of the country, which i ahsorbes water slowly and with difficulty, and apparently gives it up with an equal want of facility. It is one admirably adapted, however, for surface drainage, as all the rainfall can, with a proper provision of channels, be passed away. G. Dr. lmthurn, in the last report, pointed out that in this open spot the Asylum is exposed to the prevalent east and north-east wrinds, which blow over a large extent of low grass-covered land, liable to be submerged during the rains, and which he considered, and probably with some justice, as likely to affect the health of the inmates unfavourably, besides exposing the kutcha buildings to damage during high winds and gales which occasionally occur. To do away with these objectionable circumstances as much as might bo, a hedge of erythina was planted, so as to form part and parcel of the Asylum boundary fence. This did not thrive very well during 1876, and the renewal of the outer boundary fence in 1877 has rendered the removal of most of what little there was necessary. I do not look on this as a matter for regret, as any thick boundary of vegetation, sufficient to protect buildings, would have impeded the proper circulation of the air. What is required is a good belt of trees lying some distance from the Asylum boundary, which would protect from violent winds and malaria-burthened air without interfering with free ventilation. 7. The Asylum, in its present condition, cannot be looked on as anything else but a temporary makeshift; only two buildings, the hospital and the cells, being such as it would be desirable to retain permanently. &quot; 8. The hospital is a neatly-constructed &quot; chang&quot; bungalow, with boarded floors, and contains iiwo rooms and two closets. Owing to want of proper offices, &c, one of these rooms has been, and is, used as an office, whilst until recently tho overseer used the two closets as his residence. This latter, ot course, was objectionable, but unavoidable under the circumstances of the case. The building was not put to its original intended use at first, one of the ordinary huts being used as a hospital, In the dry weather this was the most satisfactory arrangement, as a boarded floor is |lot at all suited to tie dirty habits of many or most of the insanes, bad enough when they are in their ordinary bodily health, but ten times worse when they are ill. During the rains, however, I was compelled to bring the sick into the hospital building, owing to the extreme dampness of the huts; and *}ny anticipations as to the difficulty of keeping the ward anything approaching to clean and sweet have been fulfilled. 9. The padded colls are two in number, and stand out alone near tho hospital as a single solid masonry structure, in cubic space and superficial area they are ample, but 1 cannot say that they pre in any way perfect. The ventilation has been pronounced good, but I cannot say that I consider .at ventilators placed close to the roof of a lofty cell, the lower portion of which is completely sealed, &quot;with the exception of a small drain on one side, is well ventilated, and this is just the condition of these; jjolls. They are closed by heavy battened doors, so that no air can enter from the floor or from below. &quot;is matter is ot* importance, as it has prevented my using the only means of seclusion in my power &raquo;ar less than 1 should otherwise have done. It is advisable ai times to keep patients secluded and quiet, and this is done with advantage when '&quot;inurement in such dungeons as these for any but the shortest periods could do nought but harm. One of the fust requirements of the Asylum is properly-constructed well-ventilated separate rooms 1 CellB, in which insanes can be placed in seclusion without depriving them of all fresh air and light. ry apt to found to suit, that le males, lemselves j on the hcea, and on.

REPORT ON THE TEZPUR LUNATIC ASYLUM. 10. It is unnecessary to enter into any detail regarding the dormitories. The area and space is ample, and there has been no overcrowding. In the last report it is mentioned that, originally, each hut had four doors in front and four windows behind, and that two of the doors in front were replaced by windows owing to the cold being too great and to the necessity of doing away with doors as much as possible, for the sake of security. The effect of this change was most unfortunate, as the substitution of small windows for the doors destroyed in the main the power of properly ventilating and drying the huts, whilst in the hot weather and rains this reduction of the entrance of fresh air to the minimum made the heat in the huts unbearable, and added unnecessarily to the sufferings of the inmates. To shut out all possible ingress of air, in order to keep the huts warm, is a most insanitary plan, whilst the same object could have and has been attained by moveablo shutters, or jhamps, which can be raised or lowered as required. Owing to the condition of the huts above named, I had to replace all the windows with bamboo-latticed gratings reaching to the ground, to the greatly increased comfort of the patients. 11. The outer fencing is made of pointed bamboos 12 feet high, and is as much as is required, as, in my opinion, more lunatics, as is the case with prisoners, escape through negligence on the part of the guards than from imperfections in mere brick and mortar, or such physical modes of restraint. 12. Any suggestions as to the improvement of the Asylum as it now stands would bo thrown away. The buildings are really but makeshift in the main, and to lay out any great sum on them, in fact, to do more than make them as secure and watertight as possible, with attention to sanitary requirements, would be a waste. What is required is (1) Properly-built, well-ventilated, dry, secure dormitories, with floors of asphalt impervious to damp, for the various classes of insanes: (a) Criminal. (b) Quiet non-criminal. (c) Violent ditto. (d) Dirty ditto. (2) Separate cells, well ventilated and lighted, with separate enclosures or yards in front for the seclusion of violent patients or others whom it may be necessary to keep apart from the rest without depriving them of air and light. (3) A hospital with an impervious waterproof floor and a dispensary. (4) An office. (5) Overseer and compounder's quarters. 13. In mentioning these points I have not gone into any detail, which will be better considered when the places for the permanent Asylum are finally discussed. It has been proposed to make use of the outer wall when built, as one of the Avails of the dormitories, the roof being lean-to on the inner side of the wall. This proposition is based on tin1 ground of economy, and, if thorough ventilation, &c, can be secured, there is no great objection to it in my opinion, though I prefer much the plan of separate dormitories, on the pavilion plan. 14. Water-supply.There are two wells, one in the centre of the Aslyum, and one under the partition that separates the women's from the hospital yard. The water is good, but fails during the hot weather, so that it has to be brought from a distance. The depth of the wells is 45 feet, and they are both masonry lined. Hound the main well a masonry platform has been built during the year, to keep the precincts from being soaked with foul water. The insanes are made to bathe daily. As long as there is sufficient water in the well, ablution is carried on within the Asylum; but at other times they are taken to the Mora Borelli to bathe. This is the opposite to objectionable, as the exercise and change have a favourable influence on the patients. 15. Conservancy.There are four latrines in the Asylum, but it is most difficult to keep them sweet and clean, or even to get some insanes to use them at all. They are small thatched buildings with reed walls and raised earthen floors. The excreta are removed and buried in trenches outside the Asylum walls. At first, the trenches were dug about 100 feet from the fence, but this has been put a stop to, and they are now some 200 yards off. So that there is no chance of foul air entering the place from them. Up to July, the conservancy was carried on by the insanes somewhat inefficiently, and with difficulty. Since then, a permanent mehter has been placed on the establishment. 10. Drainage.This is now in efficient working order. Outside the fence on all four sides is :' drain 3 feet deep, and inside the fence is another 2 feet deep. These latter collect the water from tin' inside of the enclosure by numerous channels of greater or less depth, and from them the water passes into the larger drains outside. 1 propose deepening all the drains, so as to leave nothing, if possible, to |,e desired on this score. 17. Cleanliness.The whole precincts are kept scrupulously clean. Much difficulty has bee&quot; experienced in clearing and keeping down the grass jungle, which is so marked a feature, and .-&gt;' persistent an enemy in this part of the world. This has been done more or less effectually by meal'&quot; of the insanes themselves, affording them light and healthful work. 18. Pop Remaining... Admitted ..

The admissions in 1877 were (inclusive of re-admissions) about half of those of 187G, and less than half, if the re-admissions are omitted. The diminution occurs in both classes, viz., those who fftre natives of Assam, and those who are immigrants from other Provinces, thus: Admission. 187ti. 1877. Natives of Assam ,, of other Provinces 45 19 10 14 This diminution depends probably on a grand rush having been made in 187G to get rid of such useless members of society as those of markedly unsound mind, on the first opening of the Asylum, rather than to any decrease in the relative occurrence of insanity. This explanation is borne out by the considerable number whom it has been found possible to make over to the care of friends, viz., 2 in 1870, and 14 in 1877. 20. The average population in 1877 was slightly above that of 187G. The number remaining at the end of the year was less by 13. No comparison can be drawn between the total population, as the return embraces only nine months of 1870. 21. The number of re-admissions was 4. In three instances the patients had been taken charge; of voluntarily by friends or relatives, and were brought back, either on account of acute symptoms having shown themselves or of the relatives not being in a position to take care of the insanes. The fourth case was one of acute mental disorder from ganja in the same man, a mahout. 22. The discharges were as follows : 137(5 (uiue mouths). 1877. M. P. T. M.

(Statement IV.).Nothing can be said on these points, as the numbers are too few to show whether any one class of occupation renders those following it more liable to mental disease than others. 29. Ape, eye. (Statement V.).This shows that 23 out of the 24 admissions were between the ages of 20 and 40, and the remaining one above 60 years of age. Larger figures would, of course show insanity at other ages; thus, in 187(5, of 64 cases two were below 20 years and 7 between 40 and 60. As this table takes no count of the duration of the insanity, it is of no great value, as it only shows the ages at which the insanes were placed under restraint, and not the age at which insanity had first shown itself. As an example, I may mention that the one case aged over 60, admitted during the year, had, I discovered, been an inmate of the Dacca Lunatic Asylum 34 years before. 30. Types of insanity {Statement VI.).The classification employed is that of the authorised nomenclature, and the statement includes the &quot; Remaining&quot; from 1876 and admissions during 1877. The period during which the Asylum has been open is too short and the actunl numbers too small, in my opinion, to justify any authoritative deductions from this statement as to the relative frequency of occurrence of the various types; especially as so many of the admissions are of lunatics foreign to the Province. A much longer and more intricate analysis than would probably be deemed appropriate in this report would be necessary, before information of any value could be obtained, so that my observations on this point are few. 31. In the subjoined statement, I have added a fourth column, showing the total admissions according to type from the first opening of the Asylum: Remaining from 187(i. Admitted, 1877.

On the other hand, dementia and melancholia appear, according to the admissions, to be more common amongst men than women, whilst the few cases of monomania occurred only amongst the men. 32. As regards those said to bo &quot;not insane,&quot;' three were criminal lunatics alluded to before (para. 31), and the fourth was a case of mistaken identity. This patient, a beggar of supposed unsound intellect, was considered to answer to the descriptive-roll of an escaped lunatic, and was consequently sent in by the civil authorities; on the discovery of the mistake, and the determination of his sanity, he was set at large. 33. The above analysis is very imperfect. There are, however, a few other points of interest that may be obtained by an examination of the history of the cases, imperfect, though, as nearly every one of them is. A very large proportion of the insanes come to this Asylum as enigmas to be solved; for the information sent with them as a rule is insufficient, and at times drawn up in a careless manner, and apparently without the least attempt at inquiry. I presume that the forms sent with insanes arc meant for some purpose, but, as a rule, they contain little or no information of value, though much might be obtained with a little inquiry. 1 allude especially to (a) the previous history, family, and individual of the lunatics; (b) the apparent cause of their insanity, and more especially the reasons that have led to their being considered insane, before being put under skilled observation; (c) whether the insane state has originated in sickness, &c; (f/) and their habits. In the case of coolies, inquiries are especially requisite as to their state of mind before leaving their own districts, as it is not an unusual case to find that they have been known lunatics before enlistment. This forms, I presume, no portion of the coolie-depot medical officer's duties to inquire into, and, in consequence, bodily sound, but mentally unsound, individuals are sent up as coolies, to ultimately find their way into the Lunatic Asylum. 34. With reference to &quot; hereditary,&quot; no information seems to be procurable as a rule. In one case only of those admitted during 1877 does insanity seem to have been known to have existed either in the direct line or collaterally, and in this it is mentioned that an aunt was known to be insane. 35. The &quot;duration&quot; of the insanity is given as unknown in ten cases of those admitted in 1877, and in the others as of duration from one week to seventeen years; but in most the date at which the individual's change of conduct first attracted attention is taken as the date of commencement, apparently without further inquiry. Thus Mussamut Bindee, an agreement coolie, was sent to the Asylum as a lunatic; no entry is made opposite the heading &quot;duration ;&quot; but, on further inquiry being made at the tea-garden where she was employed, information was obtained that she had been looked on as of unsound mind ut her village in Bengal. She even herself stated that she was known as &quot; paglee &quot; at home. 36. Cau.se (Statement VII.)In four instances out of twenty-four admissions only, or 16*6 per cent., could ganja be assigned as the cause with any distinctness; but in these four cases there could be no doubt that it was the cause. In all four the type was mania. All of them were reported as not dangerous, but as of irascible excitable temper, given to assault, talkative, incoherent, sleepless. One committed arson. In this case there was, combined with the use of ganja (the assigned cause), grief for the loss of his wife. One was discharged cured, and the other three were much improved. One of them was excessively filthy in his habits. The only other causes which could be considered as in any way certain were (1) Loss of wife, and being baulked in the hope to get his *ister-in-law to wife, producing mania. (2) Fever, leading to dementia in two instances. (3) Loss of son and property, leading to monomania. 37. Epilepsy has occurred in only one of the year's admissions. In this case, the tendency to epilepsy was unknown prior to admission, but showed itself afterwards. This patient is a criminal lunatic, who committed an assault on a child and an old woman, and wounded them, without any motive whatever. It is not improbable that this was a case of mania, following an epileptic attack. 38. Filthiness seems to be almost a peculiarity of native insanes; at least, I do not remember it was a marked and frequent symptom amongst lunatics in other countries. Seven of those admitted in 1877 were so previous to admission, one of thcSe has proved cleanly since admission, the others continued filthy for lengthened term, and a few have gradually improved and given it up. 3D.

The diminished sickness in 1877 was to be expected, for the year generally was comparatively a healthy one, as shown by the sick returns of the jail and dispensary. 40.

The chief classes of disease were, in the two years, as under: Diseases. 1 (j\ Lib ... ... ... ... ... ... Dysentery ... Diarrhoea Other bowel-complaints Debility Amemia Lung diseases It must be remembered that the average as well as the total population was higher in 1877 than in 1876, so that the proportional admissions are less in the former than in the latter year. The most ^-marked decrease; is in the cases of fever, 37 having been admitted during the nine months of 1870&quot;, against 20 in 1877, and this coincides with general experience of other institutions and classes. Dysentery was far more prevalent in 1877 than in 187b*. This I lay entirely to local causes peculiar to the Asylum, viz., its dampness and the faulty construction of the huts. The water-supply might bo accused, and I have no doubt that in the town bad water is a large factor in causing the prevalence of dysentery ; but the water in the Asylum wells is very good, and when this failed the supply was brought from the river, from which source also the prisoners obtained theirs, without any increased prevalence of dysentery. Diarrhoea was less frequent in 1877, whilst other bowel-complaints, as colic dyspepsia, &c, were more frequent. 42. Mortality.The mortality in both years was very excessive, viz., 25*8 per cent, of average population for nine months of 187(5, which, on a rough calculation, would give for the full year about 34 per cent., and 36'G percent, for 1877. Thus, the mortality was higher in 1877 than in 187G under all circumstances. The deaths occurred amongst the patients as follows: Remaining from 1876.............................................. 47, deaths 12 Admitted 1877 ...................................................... 24, 1 From this, one would judge that there was something local which acted on the health of the inmates in an unfavourable manner, that is, that those who had been resident in the Asylum during the latter months of 187G, which wrere very unhealthy, were left in such a condition that they wrere unable to withstand seasonal and other diseases acquired in 1877. And of this there can be no doubt, as, on |juy assuming charge, 1 found most of the inmates amende to a greater or less degree. 43.

The deaths amomrst mose admitted in bad health, and remaining from 187G, were greater in 1877 than in the former year. 44.

10 EErORT ON THE TEZPUR LUNATIC ASYLUM. A considerable quantity of rain fell in April and May, by which the ground became saturated and the huts extremely damp, and this had no doubt an unfavourable influence on the health of the inmates, and led in part to the subsequent mortality. 45.

The causes of the high mortality may be summed up as follows: (1) The state of health on admission of many of the fatal cases, six, or nearly one-half, having been in bad health or epileptic. (2) The deterioration of health of a largo number of those admitted in 1876. Judging from the jail returns, and after allowing for all local disturbing causes in the jail, to enter into which is not necessary here, the months of October, November, December, 187G, and January, 1877, were unusually unhealthy, chiefly through the occurrence of fever ; and this we may presume told unfavourably on the general health of the lunatics, as a very considerable majority were found by me in February amende and more or less out of health. (3) The swampy condition of the Asylum grounds, owing to defective drainage, which led during the earlier months of the year (February, March, and April), which were dull, cloudy, and rainy, to the saturation of the floors of the barracks ; and these in most instances were never efficiently dried until the cold season. (4) The anti-hygienic condition of the dormitories from want of effective ventilation. The only openings for the entrance of fresh air available at night were small windows 3^ feet from the ground, so that no ventilation from the floor could be obtained. Another disadvantage of this was that the possibility of the floors becoming dry was greatly diminished by want of a free current of air. The clothing Avas quite sufficient, and the food good and ample in quantity. I have been very careful in seeing to this, and do not consider that the mortality in any way was raised by defects in either. 47. Cash Account (Statement IX.). The comparative cost in the two years (a proportionate addition having been made to the actual cost during the nine months of 187G to enable a comparison to be madel, is as follows: 51. 1 Govcrnmei Ontal the order ii of labour, however, t [soil in grc cotton, but tea on a p; 52.

REPORT ON THE TEZPUR LUNATIC ASYLUM. 11 ated and inmates, The increase on the cost of establishment has arisen from the necessity of employing a night watchman and a mehter. The charges otherwise remained nearly the same as in 187(5. More than half this charge is incurred for superintendence. The average cost of diet shows a decrease to a small extent (13 annas 3 pic), though the cost of tice was higher than in the previous years. This diminution is more than accounted for by the saving in the cost of vegetables grown in the Asylum, and in the price of fuel,the old materials from the outer fenem0&quot; and barracks, perfectly useless otherwise, having been used for this latter purpose during |ix months. In the average cost of clothing and bedding there has been a marked reduction. In part, this no doubt depends on the fact that in 187(5 everything had to be purchased new, and the same remark applies to contingencies, which included furniture, nearly all of which had to be purchased new in 187(5, and very little in 1877. The clothing supplied has been of good quality, and is sufficient, and is made up specially in the jail. 48. Sanctioned Establishment {Statement X).The chief alterations in this have been the entertainment of a night watchman from 22rd May, 1877 (Secretary to the Chief Commissioner's letter No. 1,335, of 6th May, 1877), and of a gardener on Rs. 10 per mensem, instead of a keeper on Us. 8 /Secretary to the Chief Commissioner's No. 2,96(5, of 20th November, 1877). For six months, a gardener was maintained on the extra establishment (Secretary to the Chief Commissioner's letter No. 702B., of 14th May, 1877. A sweeper was entertained from 28th August (Secretary to Chief Commissioner's letter No. 232B., of 21st February, 1877). The proportion of keepers to lunatics during the two years has been 1 1 I 1 i i i 3 nts wen; lied from I tabular iirk*. 1870 Male. 1 to 6-3 Female. 1 to 47 . rapid 8UCCCS-i, mill during St mortem. entorutes, ca-terated, lungs urge intestiuo, ir. lght disease, ilney. of colon, liver ditto. liver, ulcer ol itines. is both lungs, ver. mod, nicer of of lungs. ! dura mater, lnut, left side, ii parietal con- atrophy of mditis (adlie- &gt;leural tern. 1877 ... ... ... ... ... ... ltoG9 1 to 3-8 The variation in the case of the females depends on the diminished average numbers, and on the fact that, whatever the number, two keepers are required. 49. The behaviour of the keepers has been, on the whole, good. Five, however, were fined for allowing lunatics to escape, and apparently with the happiest results. In each instance, there was neglect of duty on the part of one of these subordinates. 50. Garden, manufacture, SfC (Statement XL).No manufactures have been attempted, for full employment has been found for all the lunatics willing and capable of working in and about the Asylum precincts and garden. The distribution has been Daily average y-G7 4-10 3- 2-55 2-04 1-98 (5-03 G- 35 Clearing the compound, and clearing away jungle In the garden Cooks...

(55-8-6, chiefly represented by the saving to Government in cost of vegetables. On taking charge, I found the place a perfect jungle, and it has taken all the year to get it into the order in which it is now,clean and neat in every corner. Of course, this represents a large amount of labour, for which no cash credit is taken or allowed by Government. There are two circumstances, however, that militate against very successful gardening at present, the inferior nature of the soil in great part, and the difficulty of getting water in the cold weather. I tried the cultivation of cotton, but it turned out of inferior staple, with but a poor outturn altogether. I have recently sown tea on a part of the grounds. 52. The conduct of the lunatics has been very good, indeed, it is astonishing how very few of them have shown the character for violence with which so many come into the Asylum. An orderly life, absence of excitement, good food, and kind treatment have a most marked benefit in this respect, so marked as occasionally to be delusive. 53. Five escapes occurred during the year, and were duly reported. Four were re-captured, and one is still at large. I am in hopes that the increased security of the Asylum, from the new fencing, and greater vigilance on the part of the keepers may tend to prevent escapes for the future. 54. In conclusion, I would record my favourable opinion of the conduct and qualification of the overseer, Nibaron Chundra Banerjee, who has shown zeal in the performance of his numerous arduous duties, and discretion and kindness in his treatment of the lunatics.

l(i \~Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner of Assam in the General Department, dated l&h August, 1878. Read Annual Report on the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1877. Letter No. 247S., dated 3rd June, 1878, from the Deputy-Surgeon-Gencral, Dacca Circle, forwarding, with comments, the above Report. RESOLUTION. The Deputy-Surgeon-General has, in his covering letter, toadied upon most of the I points in the Report which call for comment, and the Chief Commissioner does not consider that any very detailed remarks on his part are necessary. An analysis of figured statements based upon such small numbers as those in the Tezpur Asylum can serve no useful purpose. 2. The Asylum is a mere temporary structure. In regard to the erection of permanent buildings, the Chief Commissioner is not at present in a position to lay down any definite scheme of operations. A small Asylum is necessarily very costly; the requirements of Assam are for many years not likely to demand an Asylum sufficiently large to be conducted economically; and the funds at the Chief Commissioner's disposal will not allow of any large expenditure even on the improvement of the present temporary structure,but money will be devoted year by year to its improvement, as opportunity offers. 3. The Chief Commissioner quite agrees, therefore, with Dr. DeRenzy's suggestion, that before any steps are taken for constructing a permanent Asylum the opinion of the most experienced officers should be taken on the points raised; but he does not therefore desire to postpone altogether all improvement of the existing buildings, and such matters as sub-soil drainage, the improved ventilation, and water-supply, and the better arrangement for separate cells, may well be made at once the subject of definite proposals. 4. Dr. DeRenzy points out with much justice that the mortality was heavy (13 out of. a daily average population of 35*46), and that the expense of management and establishment, as must always be the case in small institutions, was inordinate. He is under the impression also that the Government of Bengal are willing to take charge of Assam lunatics for Rs. 90 per head, or half what they cost at Tezpur. The Chief Commissioner, if this were the case, would gladly abandon the Tezpur Asylum, and would transfer all the lunatics of Assam to the Government of Bengal. But the facts are, he fears, otherwise. It was in consequence of the great overcrowding of the Dacca Asylum that a separate arrangement had to be made for the care of lunatics from the Assam Valley districts, and it is only those from Sylhet and Cachar that the Government of Bengal can consent to receive. The Chief Commissioner is not aware of any change having taken place in the views of the Government of Bengal on this subject, but he will be very glad if the Deputy-Surgeon-General of the Dacca Circle can propose any arrangement by which the Dacca Asylum could be made to meet all the requirements of Assam. Apart fmm the Avant of space, however, the distance and want of means of communication are serious obstacles to such an arrangement, as medical authorities are agreed that the loni!* and trying journeys tend seriously to depress the condition of lunatics before admission, and thus to render their cure more difficult. 5. Dr. Delvenzy attributes the great mortality among the Tezpur lunatics to two causes, both of which he infers from the proportion which cases of dysentery and diarrhoea hear to the whole mortality. The first of these is the probability that the lunatics' rations are frequently tampered with by subordinates. This certainly happened in the Dacca Lunatic Asylum, in connection especially with the hospital diets; but no instance of it has come to light at Tezpur, and Dr. Garden expressly states that he pays particular attention to the point. The Chief Commissioner would hope, therefore, that this cause of sickness and mortality does not exist at Tezpur, The second cause is bad water-supply. Dr. Garden, however, considers that, so long as the wells do not run dry, the supply is excellent; and rhe mortality, it may be observed, did not begin till May,whereas &quot;a considerable quantity of rain fell in April and May, by which the ground became saturated and the huts extremely damp.&quot; Another source 01 bad water-supply suggested by Dr. Deltenzy is that, the wells being covered, a certain a A to 3 O C 3 P
( 2 ) amount of the water drawn up must trickle into the well from the feet and legs of the drawer, &quot; and thus the water must be a very poisonous compound.&quot; If this is actually found by observation to be the case, perhaps the use of a pump, such as has been introduced into many of the Bengal Lunatic Asylums, might obviate it; possibly also another clue may be found in the discoveries made in the Dullunda and Hazaribagh Asylums as to the habits of the patients in regard to drinking water, and the frequent appearance of intestinal worms in consequence. (See pp. 15 and 16 (Dullunda), and p. 34 (Hazaribagh) of the Bengal Annual Report on Lunatic Asylums for 1876.) The discovery there made is quite worth following up. 6. Dr. DeRenzy, in commenting on the Superintendent's remarks on the necessity! for more complete information being recorded on the forms of inquiry, lays stress on the desirability of always making strict inquiry as to whether the relations of non-criminal lunatics have, or have not, the means of contributing to their support in the Asylum. The attention of all District Officers has already been directed to the necessity for making such inquiry, the orders of the Government of India in the matter having been circulated for their guidance. In the case, however, of emigrant coolies in Assam, it is almost impossible that full] information should be obtained. 7. In conclusion, the Chief Commissioner is glad to observe that due attention is paid to conservancy arrangements, and that the premises are, as far as possible, kept neat and clean. The labour of the lunatics on the garden has been satisfactory even from a financial point of view, and has doubtless had still more important results in promoting the health of the insanes. The conduct of the lunatics and the behaviour of the keepers are described as having been good. The Superintendent reports very favourably in regard to the overseer. Dr. Garden deserves great credit for having done so much with very poor materials ; he has devoted great care and pains to a very unpromising problem, and the beneficial effects of his careful supervision are very manifest. I By order of the Chief Commissioner of Assam, S. 0. B. RIDSDALE, Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam.

REPOET ON THE TEZPUK LUNATIC ASYLUM, 1878. -----------------&#9830;----------------- No. 57S. FromA. C. 0. DeTiexzy, Esq., Deputv-Snrgeon-Gencral, Assam Circle, ToThe Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam. In forwarding the Annual Report on the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for 1878, I have the honour to submit the following observations: When making my remarks on the report for the previous year, I had not had the advantage of a personal knowledge of the institution as I have on the present occasion. Having Inspected it carefully on the 17th December, 1878, in company with the Superintendent, IDr. Garden, and having had more experience of the Province generally, I feel myself warranted in speaking with confidence on some points on which I felt doubtful before. 2. The site of the Asylum is an excellent one. It is a high plateau, well raised above the Brahmaputra, and admits of perfect drainage in all states of the river. The soil is a rather stiff clay, and apt to retain moisture, but this defect can be remedied, and lias been 'to a great extent already remedied by deep drains such as Dr. Garden has constructed. 3. The dormitories are mere bamboo huts, such as the people of the country live in. So far as concerns health, and bearing in mind the mildness of the climate and the habits . of the insanes, I am strongly of opinion that these huts are more wholesome than far more costly buildings would be. They afford sufficient protection against cold in the winter i months, and in the summer they are cool and airy. The dampness of the floors, of which 4 Dr. Garden speaks, will be remedied by more efficient drainage at little cost. 4. A hut is required for the accommodation of the medical subordinate, who is in immediate charge of the Asylum. 5. When funds admit, it is very desirable that a substantial fence about 5 feet high &#9632;should be constructed round the Asylum. At present, there is only a very fragile perishable bamboo paling, which is not enough to keep lunatics from straying away. G. Nothing could be more perfect than the cleanliness maintained in the huts, the latrines, and, in fact, in every part of the Asylum. Among the insancs are man)?- patients I of indescribably filthy habits, and it is exceedingly difficult to keep the huts occupied by Isuch patients sweet and clean. Dr. Garden has most skilfully taken advantage of the j deodorising powers of dry earth to accomplish this. 7. The average population of the Asylum in the year was 40 (omitting decimal parts). The averages for the years 1877 and 187G being 35 and 34, respectively, shows ; there was thus an increase of 5 over the average of the previous year. 8. At the close of the year, there were 4G patients, classified as follows: Natives of Assam...................................................... 27 Of other Provinces, imported and free emigrants............... 17 Native nlaco unknown................................................ 2 These figures indicate a steady tendency to increase in the population of the Asylum. [ 1 hey also show how largely, as might be expected, the population is recruited, from the
J 2 REPORT ON THE TEZPUR LUNATIC ASYLUM. labourers imported from Bengal and other provinces. This same fact is also shown in the classification of the admissions of the year, for there were, oat of a total of 23 admissions, . Natives of Assam...................................................... 13 Other Provinces .........................................,............ G Unknown............................................................... 4 It may be taken that about one-half the population will for some years to come be derived from other provinces, chiefly Bengal. 9. Classifying the average population and the admissions as criminal and non-criminal, the numbers were as follows in the years 1877 and 1878: Admissions. 1877. 1878. Criminal................................................ G G Non-criminal .......................................... 14 17 Daily average population. Criminal...........................,.................... 8'38 12-88 Non-criminal.......................................... 27*13 27'54 These figures are too small to admit any safe induction; but, so far as they go, they1 show that, while the admissions of criminal lunatics have not increased, the average population of this class is about 50 per cent, greater than in 1877. 10. The total net cost of the Asylum for the year was Rs. 5,891-4-6, against Its. 6,262-5-8 in 1877, showing a reduction of Rs. 371-1-2. The cost per head of population has fallen to Rs. 145-11, against Rs. 176-9-6-i- in the previous year. 11. The capitation cost for establishment has fallen from Rs. 86-15-4 in 1877 to j Rs. 77-8-3. This is due to the increase in the population of the Asylum, the actual cost of the establishment being greater by Rs. 50 than in the previous year. The main reduction was under the heads of diet and clothing, and is due to good management. Though the price of food was nearly the same as in 1877, the capitation cost of diet fell from Rs. 70-10-3 to Rs. 58-10-10. This marked reduction is ascribed by Dr. Garden to increased carefulness in checking the expenditure, and in purchasing the cheapest articles of j diet, when such could be done without detriment to health, to the use of old material a&gt; fuel, and to the purchase of the rice in the open market, instead of through a contractor. 12. The capitation cost of clothing and bedding fell from Rs. 7-7-10 to Rs. 4-9. This reduction, too, was not obtained at the cost of comfort or sufficiency of clothing, but as the outcome of careful supervision. The capitation charge for contingencies was Rs. 14-0-1, against Rs. 10-7-10.J, in 1877' Dr. Garden justly points out that under this head is included the cost of several articles which should properly have been provided before the Asylum was declared open for the reception of patients. Thus, among the contingencies of this year is the cost of a weighing machine, without which, I agree with him, the treatment of lunatics cannot be properly carried on. The cost of this instrument (Rs,. 200) is nearly one-third of the whole charge under the head of contingencies. This charge will not recur again. 13. The net cost of the institution and the capitation charges as here given differ from the figures given in the report under these heads. \\\ stating the net cost of the institution, I have deducted the cash value of the food produced by the lunatics themselves, and also the money received on account of paying patients. The capitation cost is wrongly calculated in the report, the total population under treatment being taken as the basis of calculation, and not the average population, as ought to have been done, and as was done in the previous year's report. 11. There was a most gratifying improvement in the health of the Asylum. There were only '2 deaths, against 13 in the previous year, hi the two previous years tin leath-rate [t fell to 4 patients. 15. very lar n e dition and om the i prevailing lealth las treated, ai cance in number &lt; Medical ( another a and diarr diseases, defect in decrease 16. prevalent or a com {?&gt;) insu to exchu conclush Dr. Gar&lt; I such as] I 17.

UErORT ON THE TEZPUll LUNATIC ASYLUM. ideatli-rate varied from 3d to 3G per cent, of average strength. In the year under review it fell to 4&quot;9-i per cent. This is as low as it can be eNpccted to be in such a class of patients. 15. When the population is so small, the death-rate must be eNpccted to fluctuate fvcry largely froth year to year, as the result of mere accident, depending on the mental condition and general health of cases on admission, and other circumstances. But, quite apart from the reduction of the death-rate, we can safely infer, from the nature and character of the prevailing sickness among the lunatics, that there was a decided improvement in their health last year&quot;dysentery and diarrhoea were less common and very mild and easily treated, and in only one instance proved fatal.&quot; I do not think that there is much significance in the statistics of the number of admissions to hospital and the daily average number of sick. These numbers depend to a great extent on the idiosyncracy of the Medical Officer in charge, one man thinking it best to treat many cases as out-patients, [another as in-patients, but the reduction in the frequency and severity of cases of dysentery and diarrhoea is full of meaning. As lunatics have no special tendency to suffer from these diseases, the frequent occurrence of them in an Asylum is strongly suggestive of some defect in the sanitary arrangements. It will be worth while to inquire to what the decrease of these diseases in the Tezpur Asylum last year was due. 16. In my remarks on last years report I threw out the suggestion that the prevalence of bowel-diseases among the Tezpur lunatics depended on one of three causes, or a combination of all three, viz., (1) dampness of the floors, (2) the use of impure water, (3) insufficient food. After a careful physical examination of the lunatics, I feel compelled to exclude the third hypothesis altogether, for I found that their condition furnished &#9632;conclusive proof that they were well fed, and the stringent supervision maintained by Dr. Garden made it quite impossible that there could have been any peculation of the food, such as has occurred in other Asylums. 17. As regards the influence of the damp floors, I am in entire accord with Dr. Garden, and I am quite satisfied that a large share of the decrease in the prevalence of dysenteiy and diarrhoea, and of the general improvement in health, is due to the improvements in drainage effected by that officer. 18. Dr. Garden denies altogether that the use of impure water had anything to do with the causation of sickness in former years. The water-supply, he says, was identical in 1877 and 1878, and therefore the improved health of the latter year canaot have been due to any change in that particular. I think Dr. Garden is mistaken on this point, for para. 4 of his report shows that the water was not identical in the two years. There Was, . m tact, a most important difference in the water-supply of the two periods. Dr. Garden |; says &quot;the supply from the wells failed less, as regards quantity, so that it was less often &#9632; necessary to send the insanes to the Mora Bhorelli river to bathe, and on no occasion was the drinking water obtained from any other source than the wells. The chances of the uisanes swallowing impurities was thus far reduced,but not done away with, for, as is well Known, it is utterly impossible to keep even sane natives from putting into their mouths some of the water they bathe in, however foul it may be.&quot; Now, the water of the Mora Bhorelli contains a large amount of suspended matter, and I some four miles above the Asylum the stream receives a very foul allluent. With the X Knowledge of the case of the Dullunda Asylum given at para. 31 of the Sanitary Report Ilor last year, can anyone doubt that the use of such water, even for ablution purposes, ' Would lie dangerous to the health of the lunatics? The Dullunda Asylum case shows that the supply of pure water for drinking purposes only bad no appreciable effect for the better on the health of the inmates, so long as they were allowed access to impure tanks tor ablution purposes; but, as soon as access to impure water for any and every purpose
RErOIlT ON THE TEZPUft LUNATIC ASYLUM. whatever was cut off, the lunatics enjoyed an almost complete immunity from dysentery and worms. The inevitable inference from this case is that the cause of the dysentery and of the worms lay in the impure water which die lunatics had been using for ablution,| 19. I may here state that Dr. Garden has evidently mistaken the argument I founded on the Dullunda Asylum case in the Sanitary Report. From para. 24 of his report he evidently supposes that I believe that worms are the chief cause of the dysentery of the province. Though there can be no doubt that worms' often cause diarrhoea and dysenteiy, the aim of my argument was to establish that worms and d3'sentery were, as a rule, both caused by impure water, and that both affections would cease, or nearly cease, by the entire disuse of impure water, whether for ablution purposes or for drinking purposes. 20. The Asylum well-water, though far from being as good as it might be, is much safer than the Mora Bhorelli water, and it would have been strange if the comparative disuse of the latter had not been attended with a reduction in the frequency of bowel-diseases. 21. The state of the water-supply is at present the chief sanitary defect in the Asylum, The well, not being deep enough, goes dry after long drought, showing that it is mainly fed by percolation from the surface-soil. The appliances for drawing the water, too, are defective, they consist merely of a bucket and rope, the drawer having to stand on the edge of the tube. Two evils result from this arrangement(1) there is a constant reflux of fouled water into the well, and (2) the supply of water is altogether insufficient to keep the lunatics in a satisfactory state as regards personal cleanliness. As a fact, I found several of them very unclean in their persons, their skins giving proof of infrequent ablution. 22. With regard to the employment of the lunatics, I would suggest that, now that the Asylum grounds have been pretty well drained and cleared, an endeavour should be made to employ them more in agricultural operations. This will be by far the best way of employing persons who are derived in the great majority of cases from the agricultural classes. They will be more healthy if employed moderately in the occupations they have been accustomed to. 23. Para. 35 of Dr. Garden's report, too, furnishes evidence that such employment may be made&laquo;profitable, for it appears that an average of 2*33 lunatics earned Us. 197-11-3 by garden work, or upwards of Us. 8-1 each. There is a fine piece of ground in the hands of Government around the Asylum, it is admirably adapted for cultivation, and would produce potatoes, vegetables, and fruits of various kinds, for which there is always a good demand. By utilising a piece of that land for the employment of the lunatics, 1 am inclined to think that the cost of the maintenance of the Asylum would be considerably reduced. 24. At the present stage of the Asylum's history, I do not think there would be any benefit in remarking on the classes of mental disease which have presented themselves, but I would call attention to Dr. Garden's renewed complaint of the scantiness of the information furnished on the admission of lunatics regarding their previous history. 25. In conclusion, I feel bound to record my opinion that Dr. Garden has, by his most able management of the Asylum ever since it fell under his charge, established a claim to the cordial thanks of the Chief Commissioner.

REPORT ON THE TEZPUR LUNATIC ASYLUM. ANNUAL BEPOBT OF THE LUNATIC ASYLUM, TEZPUR, 1878, Since my last report, no alterations or additions of any importance, either in the construction or arrangements of the Asylum, have been made, and, as it is not necessary for me to enter again into the question of the provision of suitable accommodation adapted to the proper classification of the lunatics, little more remains than to review the proceedings of the past year. 2. One slight alteration has been made during the year: Instead of leaving the huts separate, with a keeper's room attached to each, in six instances the huts have been placed two together under one roof, with one keeper's room in the centre. By this means increased accommodation has been obtained, and each keeper has been able to look after double the number of patients. This has been done without any extra expense, as, during the annual repairs, the huts had to be completely dismantled, and in many instances the posts had to be renewed. The whole buildings have been put in proper repair, and as Imuch of this work as possible has been carried out by the lunatics; but, after all, what they could do was but small, as they could not be trusted with any but the simplest work, such as plastering, &c. The huts, such as they are, have been kept in good order and watertight, though still presenting, through their simplicity of structure, the same facilities for ;escape in the absence of an efficient night guard that they alwa)Ts have done, and must do. Were it not for this, and for the cost of frequent renewal, my opinion is that the style of hut is quite adapted, and perhaps the best, for the class of people we have to deal with. The insecurity of the huts is shown by the fact that one lunatic dug his way out under the wall during the night, though it must be admitted that this could not have happened had the night watchman been at his post. As is usual, in this, as also in the other instance of escape during the 3rear, the keeper on guard was in fault. 3. Suitable quarters for the Overseer in charge, outside the Asylum, and close to it, jhave been constructed during the year. This was done out of the sum allotted for annual repairs. Quarters are still required for the compounder, who, in the absence of a Native l)octor, is in immediate charge of the sick. 4. Water-supply.No changes have been effected in this. The supply from the [wells during the year failed less, as regards quantity, than in 1877, so that it was less often [necessary to send the insanes to the Mora Bhorelli River to bathe; and on no occasion was the drinking-water obtained from any other source than the wells. The chances of the insanes swallowing impurities was thus far reduced, but not done away with, for, as is well known, it is utterly impossible to keep even sane natives from putting into their mouths some of the water they bathe in, however foul it may be. The water from the wells is to all appearances very good, nor are there apparently, from the position of the Asylum in an open space free from encumberment by population, any chances of its becoming contaminated by animal refuse other than the infinitesimal proportion that may : possibly be washed off the feet of those drawing water from the wells. , As it is desirable, on sanitary grounds, that the insanes should not resort to the Mora I). ' Jo I tmorelli, and consequently, as it is necessary for them to bathe at the wells, 1 quite coincide With the opinion expressed by Dr. DeRenzy, that it would be better if a tank were provided in the neighbourhood of one of the wells, from which the insanes could bathe, as it could also be adapted to the administration of shower and other baths, so efficacious in the treatment of the insane. The depth of the well is so great that a force pump would be Squired, but, as Dr. DeRenzy points out, such a pump and reservoir could, in the &deg;ase of the Asylum being done away with, be made use of elsewhere. The cost, however, will be very heavy, as the Executive-Engineer informs me that it will exceed Rs. 2,000. As formerly, the patients have bathed daily, and, when this has been carried out at the Wells, the water has been drawn by one man and by him given to those requiring it. The patients' clothing has been washed with either sageemattee or soap twice in the week, so that personal dirt as a cause of sickness might be eliminated as far as possible. 5. Conservancy,The latrines were the same in number as before, and occupied L-le same position. They were altered in some minor particulars, so as to admit of better ,eiltilation with equal privacy, and in doing this the doors were done away with. The floors
RErORT ON THE TEZPUtt LUNATIC ASYLUM. are formed of dry loose earth, which can be removed without any trouble; and the dry-ear tli The a system has been carried out as fully as possible with insanes, many of whom, as is well mon&deg;&quot;st tl known, can be induced to go to the latrine with the greatest difficulty, or not at all. Most many5 of those visiting the latrines are perfectly incapable of comprehending the simple rules off the dry-earth system, so that one has to be satisfied with the fact of their resorting for the! purpose of nature to one spot, from which it is possible to remove all traces of ordure. The! There into the A Of tin latrines are cleaned twice daily by the mehter and assistants, and the filth is carried away, and buried fully 600 yards from any portion of the Asylum. With regard to ablution, no; special provision for water is made, as 1 found from the first that the large majority of the: insanes would not use water, though ready provided at the latrine, whilst those who would use it would as readily obtain it from the well in their own vessels. As regards the water; used after washing, I found it also impossible to get any special vessels provided for its! reception used, so I was driven to the conclusion that it was safest and surest, as well as cleanest, to let the insanes follow their own plans, and to have all moisture in the neigh-bourhood of the privies removed as a portion of the excreta and replaced by fresh earth. However, even if the moisture derived from this process of cleansing were not removed, it could have no possible effect on the patients' health. From the plan in vogue, this one source of lumbricus infection is done away with. Whatever influence this may be supposed to have had, of this I am certain, that lumbrici have been of comparatively less frequent occurrence during the year. Knowing the unfavourable effects produced by these parasites on individuals in bad health, my strict order has been to the mehter and com-pounder to observe carefully and report the occurrence of lumbrici in any of the stools; and in most of the instances in which such cases have come under treatment the first information of their existence has been gained in this way. A more difficult problem has been the sanitary condition of the dormitories devoted to filthy patients, but this difficulty has been overcome, as far as may be, by the use of the dry-earth system and by the free use This Assam we As re jin either o 3n excess, increase is incurable The ] is one less The . attacks, have left was finall 9. '. of leepin 'ai &c. 6. Drainage.With all the improvements made in the drainage, I regret to say that the floors of some of the barracks became very damp, and in two instances tin barracks had to be disused. In one instance, in the male division, this was of no importance, as there was ample room elsewhere, but in the other, in the female division, the effect of the necessary overcrowding became apparent after a time, so that I had to give up a portion of the hospital to the women for the time being, and with the best result. This dampness, which results from the fact that the Asylum is built in a stratum of sandy soil of very varying thickness, lying on a bed of red clay, almost impervious to water, I do not believe irremediable, and I am at present engaged in cutting deep drains near each of the lines of barracks to be filled in with boulders, according to the plan proposed by Dr. DeKenzy, and I hope that this sub-soil drainage will have the desired effect, for the drainage carried out at the latter end of 1877 had so far a beneficial effect that fewer barracks became uninhabitable from dampness, and in the few that did so, it happened at a much later period of the season. Of course, ic would be better if the floors could be made damp-roof by a flooring of asphalt, but here again the question of expense comes to the front, for, of course, it is questionable whether it is worth while spending the necessary amount on barracks of this nature. 7. Cleanliness.The precincts have been kept invariably clean and neat, and no difficulty this year has been experienced in keeping down the jungle. Much attention has been paid to giving the whole place a cheerful look, and one pleasant to the eye, so as to remove as much as possible any jail-like appearance. Working only with the lunatics, I found it impossible to plant the row of trees to the east of the Asylum, as I proposed, but hope to be able to do so this year. 8.

This shows a decided contrast with the returns of 1877, in which the natives of Assam were fewrer in number than those from other provinces. As regards the total individuals under treatment, there were in 1878 fewer, viz., 57, than in either of the previous years, viz., 64 and 71; but the daily average, 40*42, was considerably in excess, the increase being more marked amongst the women than the men. This increase is to be ascribed in part to the nature of the cases received, more having been incurable insanes, and in part to the highly diminished mortality. The number remaining at the end of the year exceeded by 12 that of 1877, and is one less than in 1876. The one re-admission was that of a confirmed epileptic, violent before and after the attacks. She was made over to the care of a native as a servant in 1877, but appears to have left him within a short period, and taken service in different parts of the bazaar, and was finally brought back to the Asylum on account of violence, ecc. 9.

Criminal Lunatics (Statement No. 2).The admissions during the year amounted to 0, the same number as in 1877.

This statements hows that in 1878, natives of Assam doubled, or nearly so, those of the other Provinces, and in this agrees with the return for 1876. No free emigrants were admitted during the year, and amongst the imported coolies the females stand to the males as 4 to 2. 14. As far as one can gain information, these latter poor women as a rule have been of acknowledged unsound mind in their own homes, and it is not impossible that emigration has proved a favourable means for getting rid of troublesome members of communities. The number in the Asylum does not represent in any way the number brought into the Province, as a frequent complaint made by planters is that those of unsound mind are constantly received as ablebodied coolies. Until they grow troublesome or dangerous, they are allowed to remain in the gardens, and are always treated with the I greatest kindness. 15.

(Statement No. 5).The same remark as to the inadvisability of drawing deductions from limited figures applies also to this statement. Contrary to what occurred in 1877, four of the admissions were under 20 years of age, but none of these were children. On the other hand, none were over 40. As I noted in my last report, this table is of little value, as it only gives the age on admission into the Asylum, and not that at which the insanity first showed itself. 18. Types of insanity (Statement No. 6).The admissions from mania, acute and chronic, preponderate to a very considerable degree over the other forms of insanity, forming more than two-thirds of the total admissions. Melancholia, on the other hand, shows a decrease, whilst the number of cases of dementia is reduced to one. Owo, case of probably congenital amentia almost amounting to idiotcy has been entered as idiotcy. As regards paralysis of insanes, there is only one case, which figures under melancholies, under which designation lie was entered in 1876. Of the cases of acute mania, ontf is suicidal, two connected with epilepsy, and one puerperal. In this last case, the woman is now quite sound in mind, but having been tried for murder of her child and acquitted on account of insanity, she has to be detained in the Asylum. 19a.

I would here again beg to repeat the remarks I made in my last report on the unsatisfactory manner in which the papers sent with the insanes are filled in, I feel Wstilicd in calling attention to this again, as in numerous instances I have obtained much information from Deputy-Commissioners on special application made by me, which showed that the descriptive-roll had been filled in in a perfunctory manner, and without any inquiry having been made. 20.

It must )e observed, however, that such a ratio as this corrected one is deceptive, inasmuch as for the most healthy months of the year (January to March) a ratio is added, which is derived from hospital admissions of the most unhealthy months. &gt; &gt;me or ith the owing' lity of o what &gt;e were t, this ot that te and sanity, shows ;ase of ancho-ia, one tvoman mitted .mitted ssigncd 3 in 2 .signed y was 21. The Sanitary Commissioner, in commenting upon my report for 1877, seems to have thought that I was not aware of the necessity of making such corrections when I comparing periods of unequal length. 1 have simply to refer to para. 42 of that year's report to show that this was not the case. H The excessive sickness was entirely due to the increased number of cases amongst the women, for the ratio amongst men was somewhat less, whilst amongst the women it was two or three times as great as in 1877, and even exceeded the corrected ratio for 1876. the cause of this unhealthincss amongst the women may be ascribed in great part to the greater dampness of their barracks, and to the temporary overcrowding which I mentioned hefore. Curiously enough, the same higher sick-rate amongst women has been found to be the case in jail. In one particular point, however, the sick-rate of the two years has differed immensely, for, whereas in 1877 the number of serious cases admitted wras very large, and the death-rate high, in 1878 the majority of the cases were so mild in nature that they would not have been admitted into hospital in any other institution but a Lunatic Asylum, and the deaths were few. Amongst lunatics, few as a rule can or will give any account of themselves; thus, strict supervision has to be kept over them, and the slightest departures from health treated as sickness in hospital. 22. The daily average sick for the three years was as follows : Years. Male. Female.

10 REPORT ON THE TEZPUJl LUNATIC ASVLUJt. and it is not improbable that the improved death-rate depended, in part at least, to the keeping of such cases constantly in hospital under observation. 23. The main causes of disease during the year will be found in the following table. The actual figures are given, so that it is necessary in drawing comparisons to bear in mind that the average population was considerably more in 1878 than in 1877, and slightly more in 1877 than 1876: 26. 1 |hc death-rt that really : |ions are ne in his remai Assigned by Indto imp Supply duri that the sin %c difficult. |the wells in exceedingly and the wa nitrogen, & As re 1878 than their antec&lt; The c; Average population ...

Dysentery and diarrhoea were less common than in the previous years, and very mild and easily treated, and in only one instance proved fatal. Of other diseases of bowels there were 18 cases, and these were either constipation or slight disorder of the digestion, shown by loss of appetite and disordered conditions of the bowels not amounting to diarrhoea. 24. The number of cases of lumbricus treated as such was the outcome of the These mortality &quot; mortality : the efficien obtained b fact that t I to, and tli! dormitorie 27. experience rate whicl I 28. trans actio of Assam in Augusl 1878. C 29. subjoined the charg extreme care devoted to their detection in the excreta noted before, and there is no means of comparing the frequency of the occurrence of this with former years, for in 1876 and 1877 those cases that were treated occurred in patients admitted into hospital for other diseases. Whilst admitting the importance of the influence exerted by these parasites on the constitution when otherwise unsound, I do not see my way to accepting that view which considers them as the chief or only cause of that form of diarrhoea which has proved and may prove so fatal in Lunatic Asylums and analogous institutions. The occurrence of lumbricus is so common, and these worms are met so often in bodies which have died from other diseases than those of the bowels, that I cannot help considering their malignant influence as secondary. It is my habit to make post mortem examinations of nearly all the bodies which die in the dispensary or jail, and, whatever the causes of death may have been, in but comparatively few are lumbrici found absent. It seems to me that, just as lumbricus has been assigned as the cause of cholera, because in epidemics of that disease in districts where these parasites are common, lumbrici have been passed by mouth and rectum in nearly every case, so we might talk of hepatitis, nephritis, and pneumonia as dependent on the parasites, because they happen to be found in the intestines of those who die of these diseases. 25. The mortality shows in most favourable contrast to that of the two former years, for, whilst in 1876 and 1877 it amounted respectively to 34 and 36 per cent., in the year under review it reached only 4*94 per cent. In my last report I called attention to the fact that of the total mortality 12 were admissions of 1876, and only 1 of 1877, and a shniliar observation has to be made on the mortality of this year, viz., that both were admissions of 1876. I also then stated that the condition of the patients at the commencement of 1877 was generally unsatisfactory, and that anaemia was prevalent. One of the fatal cases, though in good health on admission in 1876, I found anaemic in March, 1877. In April, he managed to escape, and, after being absent two months, was brought back in such a state of emaciation and debility, that it was a wonder that he retained life so long as he did. He died from consumption. The second case, admitted in good health, had suffered considerably during her residence in the Asylum from fever, congestion of liver, diarrhoea, lumbrici, &c. Her last illness commenced with intermittent fever, but subsecpiently the diagnosis was changed into hepatitis. Shu never developed any symptoms of dropsy, but sank gradually and died. Post mortem examination showed a thick layer of fat over the body, the heart loaded with fat, and of pale colour and flabby, the lungs healthy, a fatty liver, contracted kidneys, and small ovarian cysts. Though she had passed a large number of lumbrici during the whole period of residence from time to time, and finally, within a few days of death, the stomach and intestines were found absolutely free from all signs of disease.

REPORT ON THE TEZPUR LUNATIC ASYLUM. 11 io the 20. There is no need to say anything of the influence of health on admission on the death-rate, nor of the relation of this latter to season, as the numbers were so small that really no conclusion can be drawn from them. I think, however, that a few observations are necessary on the general causes of unhealthiness and mortality in the Asylum, as, hi his remarks on my report for 1877, the Sanitary Commissioner put aside the reasons assigned by myself, and ascribed the sickness and mortality of that year to defective diet [nd to impure water-supply, I have only to remark on these points that the water-supply during 1877 and 1878 were identical, that the water is pronounced good, and that the surroundings of the Asylum are such that contamination by animal matter must he difficult. I propose sending the water for analysis, but anticipate that, like that from the wells in the jail, which are far more open to contamination, it will be pronounced exceedingly good. The soil in which the wells lie in both institutions is exactly the same, and the water in the jail has been found to contain only very minute quantities of nitrogen, &c. As regards the diet, I have been ecpially, but no more, careful in my supervision in owin&lt;r &gt;ear in ', and . much fever y and 'eated, cases, oss of 1878 than 1877, and 1 do not think that anyone could say that the insanes, considering [their antecedents, in any way present the signs of insufficient nutrition. The causes I assigned for the sickness and mortality in 1877 were (1) The state of health on admission. (2) The bad state of health of most of the lunatics at the commencement of the year. (3) The swampy condition of the Asylum grounds, and the dampness of the barracks during the first nine months. (4) The anti-hygienic condition of the barracks and want of effective ventilation. These conditions seem to me to have been amply sufficient to account for the great mortality which occurred, and I may fairly claim, I think, some share in the reduced mortality and better health of the lunatics that has occurred for the improved drainage, the efficient ventilation of the huts, and the conquering of the jungle which has been obtained by the constant cultivation of the precincts. Something also may be due to the fact that the cleanliness of the barracks has ever more and more been carefully attended to, and that now, though the floors are of earth, it is not easy to detect by the smell those 3f the means 6 and other n the which 1 and ;en in ; help lortem 3r the t.

The official visitors have met monthly on the first Tuesday as a rule for the transaction of business. The Asylum has been visited officially by Mr. W. E.

This is not due to any increase in number of the staff or amount of pay, but to the fact that certain subordinates were employed during the whole instead of only a portion of the year. The reduction in proportionate cost per lunatic is a necessary consequence of the increased average population. In the cost of diets the decrease is

Some of the saving has arisen from the use of old materials from huts as fuel! and some from the fact that the rice, &c., has been purchased for some time direct froij the bazar instead of through a contractor, the plan which was introduced on the establish.) ment of the Asylum. In the matter of clothing and bedding there was also a very large reduction. This! has not been gained at the expense of comfort or sufficiency of clothing, but it is tliej outcome of more careful supervision. The sum expended in the purchase of bazar! medicines shows also a decrease. In the matter of contingencies there is also a small! diminution, which may be readily accounted for by the increased number of the population, for the contingencies are chiefly of a general and pretty-constantly-recurring nature, independent of the number of lunatics. In the contingencies, however, are included articles which really should have beenl provided before the Asylum was pronounced fit for the reception of patients and made over as such to the Superintendent. Thus, this year's expenditure included close upon Ks. 200 (nearly one-third of the whole), the cost of a weighing-machine, without which the treatment of the insanes could not be properly carried on, and similar charges will] be necessary even yet before the rccjuirements of the Asylum are fully met. In this year's accounts there appears the sum of Rs. 37-3, incurred on account of the] Manufacture Department. This charge was incurred on account of the garden, for fencing, seeds, &c, and can only be fairly charged to this heading, since the result of such operations is a decided profit to Government. 30. The total cost per patient for the entire year was 11s. 111-0-11, or more than Rs. 65 less than in the previous year, and, though this is not as low as the average cost! of many of the Bengal Asylums, it yet compares most favourably with returns of the last year. 31. Sanctioned establishment (Statement No. 10.).No alteration has occurred in this during the year, but proposals have been submitted for a new scale of establishment, as the fact cannot be hidden that the pay is not sufficient to attract such men of intelligence and temper as are required in the delicate and ard uous duties of keepers of a Lunatic Asylum, (letting no more pay than the veriest coolie can earn, with no prospect of promotion, and with duties of the most constant nature, it is little to be wondered at that only the most stupid, and such as are scarcely fitted for the post, and whom it is most difficult to make understand the first principles of their duties, can be got to serve at the Asylum. Holding also that the best means for preventing escapes is the constant watchfulness of the keepers both clay and night, rather than iron bars and high walls, I think the number of keepers is somewhat under that consonant with thorough efficiency. Two escapes occurred during the year, but, as is always the case, they happened more through defects on the part of the keepers than on anything in connection with the structure of the Asylum. Certainly, one escaped by digging his way out of the barracks at night, but this could not possibly have occurred had the night watchman been awake going his rounds. In the other instance, the escape occurred beyond the limits of the x\syluin, and was entirely the fault of the keeper in charge. 32. The proportion of keepers to lunatics was as follows, as compared with the previous two years : Years. Male.

There can be no doubt of this fact &#9632;that patients received into the Asylum with the character of being violent, intractable, and dangerous, even murderous, have on no one occasion shown themselves such in the Msylum,in fact, the first week or two seems to have such a soothing effect that one is inclined at times to doubt whether the characters given with the patients have been written %i jest or earnest. I look on this as a sign that, on the whole, the keepers are kind to those under their charge. Tear may play a part in keeping patients quiet in the presence of a fbnllyhig keeper, but in an Asylum like this the keeper in charge of any body of the lunatics is constantly changed, and no one man has a certainty of being present to Jintimidate the lunatics when spoken with. no Garden, Manufactures, fyc. {Statement No. 11). No manufactures have been attempted, and 1 do not see my way at present to introduce such as would be profitable, fthough 1 am anxious to do so. The great majority of the lunatics seem unfit for any but most ordinary agricultural labour, and those who perform this, except under a degree of compulsion, are very few. 34.

No cash has been received during the year, but the value of the vegetables, turmeric, ginger, and mustard-seed, &c, grown within the precincts and used in the Asylum has amounted to Rs. 197-11-3, and I do not think myself that more could have been done with the materials at command. The average number entered as employed during the year in the garden, which has rendered this profit, was 2'33, such being the number that could be trusted with the garden tools; bat, as much of the weeding, &c, was done by other insanes, strict account or valuation of whose labour could not be kept, these figures are under the actual number who may be said to have been employed in the garden. Other works of a really profitable nature have been carried out by the lunatics, but no cash credit taken. Thus, all the cooking has been done, and so the wages of cooks, probably Rs. 20 per month, saved. Much of the repairs of buildings has also been done by them, which was formerly carried out by hired labour, such as plastering, leeping of the barracks, &c. A considerable amount of the drainage also has been done by them, and the precincts also owe their extreme cleanliness and neatness, almost beauty, to their labour. 36. The old and worthless compoundcr, who never showed himself fit for a position requiring so much energy and knowledge, has taken his discharge and gone to his home, and been replaced by a highly intelligent native, formerly a vaccinator in Nagpur, who shows at present (I cannot speak for the future) every signs of becoming a highly useful member of the establishment. 37.

Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner of Assam, General Department, dated Shillong, the 2?jrd June, 1879. Read Annual Report on the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for tlio year 1878. Letter No. 57 S., from the Deputy-Surgeon-General, Assam Circle, forwarding, with comments? the above Report. Read also again Resolution of the Report on the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1877. RESOLUTION. The Annual Report shows a satisfactory improvement in all directions on the results of last year. With an increased population, the diminution in mortality, in sickness, and in escapes are all satisfactory indications of good management, while the financial figures show a careful regard to economy, in feeding and clothing,an economy which the healthy condition of the inmates proves to be obtained by strict supervision, and not by inj udicious limitation of supplies. 2. The Chief Commissioner personally inspected the Asylum in July, 1878, and again in February, 1879, and adds his testimony to that of Dr. DeRenzy as to the admirable cleanliness and cheerful aspect of the place, and the rapid improvements made by Dr&laquo; Garden. He is very glad to learn that Dr. DeRenzy accepts the view that bamboo huts, if properly secured from damp, are more healthy for the Assam climate than masonry structures. This is the Chief Commissioner's own conviction, and it has an important bearing on the future of the Province. To construct masonry buildings for all the jails, lock-ups, and Lunatic Asylum of the Province is quite out of reach of its present finances, and it is highly desirable not to spend more money on the more costly class of building, if the less costly description suffices for the maintenance of health. Suggestions for such minor improvements is a hut for the native medical subordinate, an improved palisade, and the cistern and pump recommended by Dr. DeRenzy should be submitted separately for sanction. 3. The Chief Commissioner notices that of the 46 patients in the Asylum at the close of the year, no less than 17 were foreigners,imported coolies. As Assam gets the benefit of these imported coolies, it is quite fair that the Province should pay the cost of their maintenance in the Asylum, but it is otherwise with the case of those mentioned in para. 1-1 of the report, who are of unsound mind (though passed as fit to labour) when sent into the Province. These persons have no such claim; but their numbers are probably not sufficient to make it worth while to address the Government of Bengal on the subject. 4. It is satisfactory to find that, with a larger daily average of inmates, the total net cost of the Asylum has fallen from Rs. 6,2G2 to Rs. 5,891 during the year under review. The cost per head has fallen from Rs. 17G to Rs. 115. This latter figure is still very high, but the small number of inmates, combined with the cost of food and labour in Tezpur, render futile any comparison with the cost of Asylums in other parts of India. There were only two deaths during the year. A mortality rate of less than 5 per cent, is as low as such an Asylum can ever hope to show. 5. Dr. DeRenzy attributes the great improvement in the health of the inmates, and notably the diminished severity of diarrhoea and dysentery, partly to improved drainage, but mainly to the fact that well-water was used almost exclusively, and but little recourse was had to the water of the Mora Bhorelli for purposes of ablution. There seems good reason to accept this view, and the Chief Commissioner will be glad to receive a proposal for further deepening the well, and for the establishment of a force pump and cistern with taps. The cost (Rs. 2,000) mentioned in Dr. Garden's report seems unnecessarily high, but a proper estimate should be made, and, after having the project carefully examined, the Chief Commissioner will see what can be granted to carry it out.
( 2 ) The scheme also for taking up land in the neighbourhood of the Asylum, with a view to employing the inmates in agricultural operations, should be submitted separately. G. The Chief Commissioner emphatically endorses the commendation which Dr. DeRenzy bestows on the valuable services performed by Dr. Garden while in charge of the Asylum and has only to express his regret that, owing to Dr. Garden's transfer to the North-West Provinces, the Asylum lias since the close of the year been deprived of his careful and energetic supervision. 7. In the Resolution on last year's Report, the Chief Commissioner reserved for further consideration the question whether, in view of the heavy mortality and high cost of maintenance per head exhibited by the returns of that' year, it would not be more advisable to make an arrangement, if possible, with the Government of Bengal for the transfer of all Assam lunatics to the Dacca Asylum on the same terms as the lunatics from the two Surma Valley Districts are admitted, and Dr. DeRenzy was desired to take the opportunity, when visiting Dacca, to make inquiries on the subject. From Dr. DeRenzy's report, the Chief Commissioner gathers that, although accommodation might, perhaps, be provided in the Dacca Asylum sufficient to meet the requirements of the Province, it would probably be found that the cost of transport of the lunatics, to which that of the necessaiy guards must be added, would very nearly absorb the whole of the difference of cost in maintenance, especially when these transport charges have to be incurred twice over in the case of lunatics sent back to the district courts for trial when reported able to make their defence. Moreover, the objection on the score of high rate of mortality has now been removed, and the buildings of the present Asylum, although not of a very substantial character, are, on the whole, very suitable for the purpose they have to serve. Dr. DeRenzy accordingly advocates the maintenance of the Asylum. In these conclusions, the Chief Commissioner, in the main, concurs, at any rate with regard to criminal lunatics, who have still to stand their trial; and, although he is inclined to doubt whether the improved rate of capitation-cost will be maintained, he thinks that the gain in point of economy to be anticipated from the proposed change is not sufficiently clear to convince him of the necessity of discontinuing altogether the present institution. He has therefore decided on maintaining the Asylum for the present Sfc on its existing footing. By order of the Chief Commissioner of Assam, S. 0. B.

REPORT ON THE TEZPUR LUNATIC ASYLUM, 1879, No. 31S., dated Shillong, the 5th March, 1880. FromA. C. C. DeRenzy, Esq., Deputy-Surgeon-General, Assam Circle, ToThe Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam. I have the honour to submit the Annual Report on the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum Ifor the year 1879, prepared by the Superintendent, Surgeon Gr. A. Warburton. 2. The Report is so clear and satisfactory in all respects that it calls for very few comments from me. It shows that the watchful and intelligent care over all the details of the management of the Asylum exercised by its founder, Surgeon-Major Garden, has been continued by Surgeon Warburton, the present Superintendent. 3. The health of the Asylum was very good. Where such a small number of persons is concerned, too much importance should not be attached to bare statistical statements referring to only a short period of time. The death-rates of small bodies are subject to great fluctuations from merely accidental circumstances. The death-rate this year is somewhat higher than that of the previous year, viz., 6'56 against 4*94 percent, of average strength, respectively; considering the mental infirmity of the population, these, rates are very satisfactorily low. The small number of cases of dysentery and diarrhoea is a very satisfactory feature: there were only three of the former and four of the latter. Remembering how fatal these diseases were in the first two years of the existence of the Asylum, I consider the decrease in the amount of their prevalence very gratifying. The decrease is no doubt due to a variety of causes, such as improved [ drainage, unremitting watchfulness in the matter of diet, attention to the purity of the 1 water-supply, to the personal cleanliness of the lunatics, &c. 4. The buildings in which the lunatics are housed are, as stated in last year's report, of the flimsiest and least costly style,mere bamboo sheds. The fact that the lunatics have been kept in such good health in such buildings appears to me to convey a lesson that might be applied with advantage in the housing of lunatics and convicts in all parts of India. The lesson is that, in a mild climate like that of India, huts of a very simple inexpensive construction are all that is necessary for the healthy housing of these classes of the population. I am glad to say that this lesson has not been lost sight of in the case of the new jails now under construction in this Province. 5. Dr. Warburton's remark that opium and ganja-eaters did not seem in any one case to suffer in health from being suddenly deprived of these drugs deserves attention. In some jails in the Province opium is largely issued to opium-eaters, under the impression that the victims of this vice would suffer in health if they did not get their accustomed narcotic. I feel quite satisfied, as the result of long experience as a Jail Superintendent, that this is a mistake. In a few very aggravated cases of opium-eaters the convicts would have to be kept under the medical officer's immediate eye lor a few days after admission into jail ; but the vast majority of convict opium-caters would do just as well without this drug as Dr. Warburton finds to be the case with the lunatic opium-eaters. 6. I. am glad to see that Dr. Warburton recognises the value of the system of careful monthly weighing of the lunatics introduced by Dr. Garden. 1 look upon this system, properly carried out, as of the highest value in keeping the Medical Officer of a Jail or Lunatic Asylum well informed of the state of health of the inmates ()1 these institutions. There is no so good and sure a means of knowing that the diet of the institution is suitable, and that its inmates really get the food Government intend for them. 7. As there is every likelihood that the Asylum will shortly be removed to a portion of the building now used as a jail, it would be useless to make any costly altera&quot; 'ions in it. But if the present site were likely to be occupied for any length of time, I ^'ould suggest that bamboo plantations should be made in the ground in the vicinity, so
2 REPORT ON THE TEZPUR LUNATIC ASYLUM. as to have in future years a cheap supply of material for repairing the huts. Bamboos are very dear in Tezpur and the neighbourhood, and becoming more so in every year. 8. The total net cost of the Asylum was Rs. 6,531-12-10, against Rs. 5,891-4-G, The increase of cost was due to an increape in the daily average population from 40&quot;42 to 45*69. The cost per head of average population, calculated on the plan adopted in my remarks on last year's report, that is, after deducting the value of the garden produce used as food produced by the labour of the lunatics, but including all outlay made by Government on the cultivation of the garden, was Rs. 142-15-4, against Rs. 145-11 in the previous year. 9. In conclusion, I venture to suggest that a hhillat of Rs. 100 be conferred on the Overseer as a reward for his good service. Dr. Warburton confirms the good report made of this man by Dr. Garden. And, as the pay of the keepers appears to be very small, I think it would greatly quicken their zeal and their interest in their work if they each were given a small present. 1. Th I A consider!

The general arrangement of the Asylum is the same as when last year's Report was written. A considerable piece of ground outside the palisade has been broken up and put under cultivation ; this land, of which there is a largo tract in the neighbourhood of the Asylum, seems to be fairly fertile, and may in time come in useful for the growth of the articles of diet in ordinary use among the insanes. As originally proposed by Dr. Imthurn, a row of bamboo has this year been planted to the south-east of the Asylum enclosure, this in the course of a year or two will afford good shelter from the cold damp winds which prevail here, and to which may be attributed a large proportion of whatever little sickness there is among the lunatics. I proposed enclosing the Asylum and a considerable portion of the land adjoining it in a close &quot;pakoree&quot; hedge, which would not only afford shelter and seclusion for the patient while at work, but would be a most effectual barrier in the way of escape. I have now seen several enclosures formed by these hedges, and am satisfied that they might with advantage be substituted for the expensive bamboo palisade now in use, which requires to be renewed every two years, is always getting out of repair, and through which any cunning lunatic, if so inclined, might easily make his escape. As the subject of doing away with the present building, and removing the lunatics to a. portion of the jail, when it ceases to exist as such, is now under consideration, it would be a waste of time and labour to undertake any works which will not be immediately useful. 2. The system of drainage commenced in 1877 is being gradually carried out, the patients digging the trenches and carrying boulders for the purpose. The work, from a scarcity of able-bodied labour, is necessarily done slowly, but will, I think, be of good service in keeping the grounds dry and improving the sanitary conditions of the place generally. As yet, the huts do not seem to have been much benefited by the drainage, the floors of some being very damp during the past rainy season : to be of much use, it will be necessary to intersect the grounds with a number of these drains. The plan of putting a deep layer of boulders in the trenches, and then nearly filling them with earth, is an excellent one, it answers all purposes, is neither unsightly nor dangerous, as open drains would be, and when once completed gives no further trouble. 3. The palisade, put up in 1877, has become quite rotten, for repairing it the sum of Us. 341, or about half the original cost, has been sanctioned, with this we hope to renew three sides and thoroughly repair the fourth. Almost the whole of this work is being done by the inmates of the Asylum. 4. The huts, 14 in number, including the servants' houses, have undergone the annual repairs. For petty repairs to 6 of these the sum of Rs. 290 was sanctioned, but by exercising care in the purchase of materials, and employing the patients as much as possible, we have managed to thatch and put all in good order. They are well, 1 think I may say too well, ventilated. By measurement I find that there is, for each patient, a superficial of 63 and a cubic space of 690 feet. The ventilation is by open windows reaching down to the ground ; these windows form openings in the wall to the extent of 16 square feet for each patient ; if wo allow half of this for the entrance, and half for the exit of air, wre get, even when the air is &quot;still&quot; (a condition which must be very uncommon in Assam), or moving at the rate of 1 to 1^ miles an hour, some 14,000 to 20,000 cubic feet of fresh air per hour for each patient, while 3,000 cubic feet is generally supposed to be sufficient for a healthy adult. During the rain-storms so very common here for six months in the year, coming on at all hours and often with very little warning, the rain drifts in through the windows, which are so close together that the patients cannot get any shelter, and, unless the jhanips are shut, are exposed to the cold and wet. The amount of surface chilling that must result from this cannot but be productive of disease, and especially of fever and bowel-complaints, which are the most common ailments in this Asylum. Moreover, the constant entrance of rain keeps the floors wet, and deprives them of the benefit which should otherwise result from the present system of drainage. To remedy this, and upon the principle that expired air ascends, I have had the walls opened up below the eaves, to the extent of about 15 Miches, so that the windows might be closed at night without the air of the wards becoming impure. During the cold weather the doors and jhanips have always been shut, and, as theso were almost tho only opening for ventilation, the air became decidedly impure. By the system of ventilation under the eaves, the doors and windows may be shut without any bad effect. Tn one double hut, 1 had the floor taken up before the setting in of the rains, and a layer of boulders laid down to the depth of one foot, on a level with the ground, and over this placed 18 inches of dry earth. The boulders prevented die conduction of moisture from the wet soil beneath, and the floor of this ward was all through, and at tho end of the rains, as dry and powdery as when first laid down. 1 propose before the end of tho Present cold season to have treated all the wards in this way. These kutcha tloors. provided they can ^e kept dry, are, I think, much better than pucka for an institution of this kind, where the majority of the inmates arc filthy in their habits, and cannot be induced to make use of utensils for the purposes of Mature : dry earth, when soiled, is easily removed, while, from a pucka floor it is difficult, even with a hberal use of disinfectants, to remove all traces of ordure. 5. Tho hospital, with the exception of on one or two occasions, has only been used as a dav Ward for such as wero kept under observation, or required extra care in the way of dieting ; for this, &laquo; is very useful, but it is not at all suited for the reception of patients suffering from bowel-complaints;
4 REPORT ON THE TEZPUR LUNATIC ASYLUM. the board flooring, when once soiled, can never bo thoroughly cleaned. As wo have a couple of empty wards, which can at any time be made use of, we are not likely to be at any loss for hospital room. G. The padded cells are badly ventilated, and, when occupied for an hour or so,, become unbearably stuffy; this, I think, were the Asylum to remain in its present site, could be easily remedied, and tho cells become very useful. At present, I use thom as little as possible, as I consider them most unwholesome, and unlikely to improve the mental condition of those confined in them. Moreover the padding is bad, and is being constantly torn in pieces by the insancs, who, if so disposed, might easily do injury to themselves. In the female division a strong bamboo ward was built by Dr. Garden adjoining one of the huts, so as to be under the observation of the female warder. Some of tho most violent cases have from time to time been confined to this room, and, so far as I can see, it answers well for tho purpose, being secluded and quiet, and at the samo time secure. 7. The water-supply is the samo as last year ; from the beginning of May to the end of November it has been found sufficient for all purposes, but for tho other five months the patients have to bo sent to the Mura Burolli to bathe. The Superintending Engineer has been applied to for an estimate of the probable cost of deepening the wells and introducing a force pump and cistern ; but in view of the proposed changes this undertaking had better be deferred. 8. Conservancy has, as formerly, been carried out on the dry earth system, which answers admirably. The grounds have been kept very clean and free from jungle. I3 females an There we 11.

The number, 46, remaining on the 1st January, 1879, was greater by 12 than in the preceding year, and less by 1 than 1877. 9. The admissions and re-admissions for 1877 and 1878 were nearly equal ; the large number remaining at the end of the latter year being due to fewer discharges from all causes, including a very small death-rate. There were only 11 admissions (male 9, female 2) in 1879, against 22, 20, and 61 for the previous years. Of those admitted, 9 were coolies from other provinces, and 2 only were natives of Assam. The cause of the decrease in the number of admissions is probably that the majority of the chronic lunatics of the Province, who had no friends able or willing to look after them, were admitted during the earlier years of the Asylum's existence. This is well shown in the annexed table, where it will be seen that tho admissions for insanity of long standing are becoming steadily and rapidly less: Years. 1876.......................... 1877 .......................... 1878........................... 1879......................

There were no admissions nor re-admissions in 1879, against 6'6 and 8 for the three preceding years. Two males were discharged and one died; of those discharged one, a Kacharee, was tried by a jury for having killed his wife, but was acquitted on the grounds of insanity and sent to this Asylum, where he remained for 2h years without showing any signs of mental derangement; the other, after having been six months under treatment, recovered his reason and was made over to the Magistrate at Jorhat to stand his trial. A third under-trial, who is said to have killed his wife, has been perfectly sane since Ms admission, three years ago, and the Asylum Committee have recommended that he be sent up for trial. receding ) number g a very &gt;, and 64 nly were that the er them, annexed steadily Of the 11 remaining, the crimes were- Arson Homicide Grievous hurt 3 4 Unknown House-trespass 1 1 14.

Alleged causes of Insanity (Statement No. 7).Of the admissions, 4 were attributed to the excessive use ofganja, 1 to opium, and of 6 the cause of insanity is not known; 4 of the latter were imported coolies, of whom no reliable history could be obtained. As all the lunatics of the Asylum have been either opium-eaters or ganja-smokers, it is difficult to say what influence these drugs may have had upon their mental condition. Three of those admitted as ganja-smokers recovered their reason shortly after admission, with no other treatment than removal of tin; cause. The sudden deprivation of these drugs did not seem in any case to cause even temporary ill-effects, the patients soon ceasing to think of them. The difficulty of obtaining reliable information regarding the previous histories of patients still exists. What little information is obtained is not as a rule to be depended upon. Of the foreigners treated, and who for the most part are sent here shortly after their arrival in the Province, there are none who know their history, while the Assamese patients are usually old chronic cases, who have neither friends nor relations to keep them at home, and whose early history has been forgotten. 18.

ear is f0o ty for t!u, REPORT ON THE TEZPDR LUNATIC ASYLUM. i Here also is an improvement, though the average sick rate is still rather high, this, however, is due to the presence of several weakly subjects, who by frequent admission to hospital go to swell the sick list. Among the females, exactly half the sick-rate has been contributed by two weakly subjects who w(,rc admitted to the Asylum suffering from incurable organic uterine disease, and whose presence on the sick list means that they require more careful looking after, and a few extras in the way of diet. Among the male, out of a daily average of 2'54, 1*5 was contributed by *&lt;&raquo; debilitated subjects, who, hi'ing unable to work, were kept in the hospital during the day. The extra care bestowed upon feeding them necessitated their being separated from tho other lunatics. The following table gives the diseases for the past four years: 1879. Average population Fevers Dysentery Diarrhoea Other bowel-complaints Debility Anosmia Lung disease Lumbricus 1876. 1877. 1878. 187!). 34-83 35-46 40'42 45*69 37 20 31 18 6) 91 ill 3 9 21 o [ -21 28 24 7 ( 13| 4 4 7 2 8 1 5 4 3 1 3 5 3 ... 7 14 :ed to the atter were ie Asylum Irugs may loir reason rivation of ceasing to itients still foreigners , there are who have en. There is a considerable decrease in the admissions for dysentery, while from diarrhoea there were 4 admissions, or double that for either of the two preceding years, yet still a small number for people of this class, and compares favourably with the jail, where, with an average of 172 prisoners, there were 48 cases of diarrhoea. Of the other bowel-complaints, 22 were admitted under the head of dyspepsia, and two were for constipation, the dyspepsia usually meaning some temporary impairment of appetite, requiring a change of diet. There were 8 cases of debility, as compared with 2, 7, and 4, and 3 of anoemia, against 4, 5, and 1 for the three previous years. This simply means the frequent re-admission of two or three weakly subjects, and has a good deal to do with the careful system of monthly weighing introduced by Dr. Garden last year, by which any considerable loss in weight is at once noted and attended to. There were 14 cases of lumbricus, against 7 for 1878. The patients, as regards the supply of water, have been under precisely the same conditions as last year, vis., water for cooking and drinking purposes was supplied from the wells, as was also that for bathing, with the exception of four or five months in the cold season, when the lunatics bathe in the Mora Barrelli. A cause of lumbricus, which has not been mentioned in former reports, is, I think, the dhai used by the patient as animal food, and which 1 find to contain from 15 to 20 per cent, of water, the source of which is any pool which may happen to be near the Gowala's hut. The mortality is still very low as compared with 1876-77 ; there were 3, or a death-rate of G&quot;50, against 2 deaths in 1878. These deaths took place in the early part of the year before 1 took over charge, and no post mojiems were made. The causes of death have been ascribed to : Epilepsy.(1) Musst. Kolora, an epileptic admitted to hospital on 18th February, and died while in an epileptic fit on the following day. Diarrhcea.(2) Thickuru, had been frequently in hospital from dyspepsia, piles, and diarrhoea; his last admission was for diarrhoea, which carried him off after he had been in hospital 47 days. Diarrhoea.(3; Loin Kachar, admitted to hospital for choleraic diarrhoea on 7th April, and died on the 11th of same month. From the overseer's account of this case, it would appear that, in addition to diarrhoea, this patient suffered from some acute lung disease. 20. Cash Account (Statement No. 9).The following is a table of comparative cost for tho past four years. There was an error in last, year's account, which gave an average cost per head of us. 145-2, instead of Us. 152-3-7. In this year's report the figures for 1878 have been corrected: these- 187f 1877. 1878. 1870. Rs. A*. p. its. As. r. Rs. As p. Rs. As.

The cost for dieting was rather Wore than Rs. 0 per head greater than last year, the increased expense being duo to increased market fates, By purchasing at the hats in the district, instead of in tho sadder station, we shall in future diet the lunatics at a much cheaper rate than we have done hitherto. Fuel had to bo purchased, while last year there were sufficient old materials from building for this purpose. The average cost of clothing was almost the same as last year; in this direction, there is no further room for safe economy, the night and day clothing are not more than sufficient for health and comfort. Bazaar medicines show an increase of 8 annas per head; under this heading are included wines and Other hospital necessaries. The cost for contingencies has been little more than half that for last year, when tho purchase of some very necessary and useful hospital furniture increased the expenditure!
8 REPORT ON THE TEZPUR LUNATIC ASYLUM. The expense incurred in cultivating and fencing some new land rouud the Asylum lias increased the cost for manufactures. 21. Sanctioned Establishment (Statement No. 10).In this direction there has been no change though the number of lunatics has increased The Overseer has shown himself most deserving of tlle high character bestowed upon him by Dr. Garden, upon no one occasion have I had any occasion to find fault with him. The keepers have done remarkably well, considering their class and pay. They have been kind and considerate to the patients in their charge, and the fact of there having been no escapes during the year, although the palisade has been most insecure, speaks well for their watchfulness and care. 22. Garden, Manufactures, eye. {Statement iVo. 11).The employment of the lunatics has been very much the same as formerly. A sufficient number were employed in the garden to ensure a liberal and varied supply of vegetables for the whole year. The grounds, too, have been kept very clean, and in the rains a large number of lunatics are required for this purpose. But what is in reality a much more profitable employment is the draining, repairing, and budding, which has this year been done almost entirely by the lunatics; we have advanced from plastering and leping to thatching and palisade build-ings, the result, as 1 have previously remarked, being that, with the sum sanctioned to thatch and repair six huts, we have completed the thatching and repair of every hut in the place, 14 in number, and for little more than half its original cost, and for a sum that was considered merely sufficient for repairing, have completely renewed three-fourths of the palisade, and thoroughly repaired the remainder. In tbe distribution of the lunatics for work, the greatest care has been taken that only the very safest lunatics are allowed the use of edged tools.

Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner of Assam, in the General Departmint, dated Shifting, the 2 [at April, 1880. Head Annual Report on the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 18711. Letter No. 31S., from the Deputy-Surgeon-General, Assam Circle, forwarding, with comments, the above Report. Read also again Resolution on the Report on the Teapur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1878. RESOLUTION. The Chief Commissioner is clad to learn from Dr. Warburton's Report and the U _ All review of it contained in Dr. DeUenzy's letter No. olS., dated 5th March, 1880. that the working of the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum during the past year has been maintained with the same measure of success, both in regard to the health of the inmates and to the economy of the management, as in the previous year. The officers in charge have worked under some disadvantage, as it was known to them that the question of abolishing the Asylum was under consideration. 2. The sickness and mortality among the inmates, and the great expense of their maintenance in the earlier years of its existence, led the Chief Commissioner to inquire from the Government of Bengal if a system could be arranged by which all but criminal ex-lunatics and harmless insaues belonging to the Province could be transferred to the Bengal Asylums of Dacca and Dullunda, with a view to the abolition of the Tezpur Asylum. The replies to his inquiries show that at Dacca the accommodation is insufficient to allow of such a transfer, and at Dullunda the cost would render it the reverse of economical, and in any case there is not room in these Asylums to receive such a proportion of the lunatics as would enable him to dispense with the Tezpur institution and its establishments. He has therefore been compelled to abandon the idea, and he does so with the less reluctance, as during the past two years the mortality has been inconsiderable, and the management has been creditably economical. lie will therefore be prepared to consider those recommendations for improvement which Dr. Warburton may now think it essential to send up. 3. The proposals of the Superintendent to break up a large portion of the land available in the immediate neighbourhood of the Asylum, and to surround the enclosure with a close &quot; pakoree&quot; hedge, are good, and should be carried out. The system of drainage which has been adopted, of cutting trenches and inserting a deep layer of boulders and then nearly filling them with earth, seems to be an excellent one. Very satisfactory results have also been obtained by adopting the similar procedure of putting a layer of boulders under the earth floors of the huts, as this plan has been found to provide an effectual and easy cure for the evil of damp floors, which has hitherto been found so difficult to provide against under the usual conditions of buildino; in Assam. Dr. Delienzv, Denutv-Surgeon-General _ &gt;~ ill 1 if o oi the Assam Circle, in forwarding the report, points out that, though the buildings ot the Asylum are still of the flimsy and inexpensive nature they were described to be in last year's report, this circumstance has proved no obstacle to the maintenance of the lunatics in good health. The Chief Commissioner is glad to find such a high authority on sanitary matters supporting his view (in which each year's experience confirms him) that in the clamp and equable climate of Assam both health and economy are better consulted by housing the inmates of Lunatic Asylums and Jails in constructions of bamboos and mats, rather than of timber or bricks and mortar. 4. The large proportion of natives from other provinces in the Asylum population is very noticeable. Since the Asylum was started, in 187 G, 40 per cent, of the inmates have been foreigners. In the year under review, nine foreigners were admitted and only two natives of Assam. This is probably correctly explained by the Superintendent, when he points out that the chronic lunatics of this Province who had no friends to look after them were all admitted in the earlier years of the existence of the Asylum. On the other hand, foreigners who become lunatics are usually without any friends in this Province to support thern. In most instance also it is, from the nature of the case, almost impossible to trace the history of lunatics who are foreigners, as they are usually unable to give any account of themselves. The Government of Bengal has signified its willingness to return to their homes,
'(2 ).- ' . . at the expense of the Labour Transport Fund, such imported labourers as become insane, and whose friends in their own countiy can be traced. It is important, therefore, that every effort should be made to trace the native place of residence of these patients, of whom there are already several in the Asylum. 5. The Chief Commissioner notices that the Superintendent records it as his experience that no apparent danger has been found in discontinuing suddenly the use of opium and ganja to patients who have been addicted to these drugs. He would call the especial attention of officers in charge of jails and lock-ups to this experience, which seems worthy of notice, since the opposite opinion has, he believes, been very frequently held. 6. The report shows a very satisfactory management. The year has 'been fairly healthy; and though the cost of dieting per head has somewhat increased, this is due to the increased cost of provisions during the year, and slight variations from year to year on this account are unavoidable. 7. As the recommendation for increasing the pay of the establishment was, at the request of the Chief Commissioner, postponed for special reasons apart from the merits of it, and the men have, notwithstanding, done good service, the Chief Commissioner is willing to accede in a modified form to tlie present recommendation of the Deputy-Surgeon-General to give a special bonus to the overseer and warders. A reward of Rs. 50 will be given to the overseer, and Rs. 8 to each peon. The Chief Commissioner, however, does not consider such a method of reward desirable as a precedent, and he would prefer that the question of re-organising the establishment on a proper footing should be thoroughly considered on its own merits. By order of the Chief Commissioner of Assam, C. J. LYALL, Offg. Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam.

REPORT ON THE TEZPUR LUNATIC ASYLUM, 1880. No. 60S., dated Shillong, the 30th March 1881. 'FromJ. J. Clarke, m.d., Deputy-Surgeon-General, Eastern Frontier District, ToThe Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam. I have the honour to submit the Annual Report on the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for [the year 1880, prepared by the Superintendent, Surgeon G. A. Warburton ; and I beg to explain that in submitting it some delay has arisen, on account of my having been [unavoidably detained longer than usual on tour of inspection. 2. The average population of the Asylum was 45'85. There were 33 admissions to hospital, against 89 of the previous year. The daily average sick was 1*23, against 6*23 and 4*30 of the two previous years. Under the chief headings of sickness there were also fewer admissions, viz., fevers 7, dysentery 1, diarrhoea 2 ; and this low sick-rate compares most favourably with former years. But, although the sick-rate was low, the death-rate was comparatively high, viz., 15*26 per cent, of total daily average population, and this exceeded either 1878 or 1879, though it was not so high as 1876 or 1877. The explanation offered by the Superintendent is : &quot; The reversed position taken up in 1880 by the figures of admissions to hospital and deaths as compared with 1879 is not that in one year more than another greater care was shown in the selection of those fit for hospital, but it is to a great extent due to the fact that of seven weakly subjects who increased the sick list for 1879, five of these, viz., 4 males and 1 female, died during the year under review, and that whilst these chronic cases increased the sick list for 1879 they swelled the death-rate for 1880.&quot; And this fact, I may observe, illustrates how necessary it is, in dealing with vital statistics, to take into our calculation each and every factor,such as season, local surroundings, [class and condition of patient, &c,and the more limited the area the more important it is for us to consider every possible varying condition and circumstance. The high death-rate, then, as above noted, is in no way attributable to any particular defects in the Asylum or the working of it, but is simply due to the incurably weak and debilitated condition of the insanes since their first admission. Of the seven who died, six succumbed under debility and emaciation, and the seventh died in an epileptic fit. 3. The system of draining by boulder-drains is most admirable, and I found the earth, when dug up in many different parts of the wards, perfectly dry. 4. The new &quot;cactus&quot; hedge enclosing the Asylum area will, when full grown, be a great improvement on the old palisade; it will be more economical, less unsightly, and a more effective barrier against wanderers, or those keen enough to escape. 5. In paragraph 9 of the Superintendent's report an account is given of the escape of an insane who had recovered his reason, and who managed at night, during a storm, to break through the palisade and get so far beyond reach as entirely to evade recovery. The new &quot;cactus&quot; hedge, when sufficiently grown, will, it is to be hoped, prevent such a recurrence. 6. I consider the employment of the insanes in the various ways their services were utilized in carrying on the work of the Asylum of first importance.' Occupation, in the shape of light work and amusement, should always be fully recognized in dealing with insanes, and the value of this mode of treatment is fully appreciated and exercised by Ur. Warburton. 7. As in former years, so during the past year, the system of weighing the insanes Weekly or monthly, as the case may be, has been carried on, and the weight of each jnsane from time to time throughout the year has been carefully noted and kept up, and 1 his diet duly regulated thereby. 8. The total cost of the Asylum was Rs. 6,874-6-3, against the total cost, K8. G,776-9-10i, of 1879- The cost of diet was Rs. 53-11-1 per head, against Rs. 60^8-8
2 RErOET ON THE TEZPUR LUNATIC ASYLUM. in 1879. Provisions were cheaper during the past year, and there has been, in consequence a decrease of Rs. 6-13-7 in the average cost per head of dieting; but under the bead of clothing, bazar medicines, and contingencies, there has been a slightly increased expendi. ture. The total cost per head of population was Us. 143-9-6. 9. In conclusion, I consider the management and medical supervision of the Asylum to be conducted with zeal and judgment, and to reflect much credit on the Superintendent, Dr. Warburton. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, J. J. CLARKE, m.d., Deputy-Surgeon*General, Eastern Frontier District.
RErOUT ON TIIE TEZPUR LUNATIC ASYLUM. .&quot;, ANNUAL EEPOET ON TEE TEZPUR LUNATIC ASYLUM, 1880. In last year's Report I proposed enclosing the Asylum and some of the adjoining ground in a closo &quot;pakoree&quot; hedge. The hedge has been made; but for &quot;pahoree&quot; I have substituted cactus and castor-oil plant, this is growing well, and will in tho course of two or three years do away with the necessity for palisades, over which it will be a great improvement, in so far as appearances are concerned, and will probably be a greater preventive to escapes- The palisades are kept up at an average annual cost of Rs. 300, while the hedge, which has a ditch on either side, was constructed at a cost of Its. 50, including planting. On the ground newly taken up urhor has been sown, and is turning out an excellent crop. This enclosing hedge prevents tho patients from straying away, and allows of their being shut off from the general public while at work, without giving the place anything of a jail-like appearance. 2. The system of draining tho grounds by means of boulder drains is still going on, and by the end of tho present cold season we hope to have completed it. It was commenced in 1877, and is an excellent plan for a high sito like this, and is, moreover, very easily done, and requires no skilled labour, tho work being performed by the lunatics, without any outside aid. 3. The general plan of the buildings remains unchanged, they have all boon put in good repair, though the sum of money allotted for the purpose is annually decreasing. Ventilation under tho eaves has been introduced, and boulders have been placed under all tho floors in the male division, those ia tho wards of the female division will bo so treated during present cold season. The completed wards were very dry and airy during the last rains, and now, during tho cold season, the air in them seems pure and sweet even when tho patients are all present and with the jhamps down, as they are at night during the cold weather. In narrow wards,.such as these, with windows on either side and a through current of air, it would be imprudently exposing the patients to leave the jhamps open at night; besides the great object of ventilation, plenty of fresh air without draught, is obtained by the ventilation under the eaves, assisted by the unairtight condition of all parts of these kutcha buildings. The jhamps are closed during tho cold weather at 9 p.m., and opened the first thing in the morning. From sunset until daylight is a long time for tho patients to be shut up in their wards. As they are continually complaining to me of the weariness of this system, 1 shall for the future allow them an extra hour or two in the day-room, where, as there are several musicians among them, they may amuse themselves as they are allowed to in European asylums. 4. The hospital and padded cells remain very much as they were last year. Tho colls are seldom required; they have been padded with canvas instead of leather, and the patients amuse themselves by tearing the canvas to pieces, hardly a safe employment, considering the state of mind of those employed. The hospital has the great objection of having a plank flooring, the most unsuitable, next to pucka, of any for this country. 5. The water-supply is the same as last year, the wells are not sufficiently deep, and when the river reaches its lowest level they do not contain more than two or three feet of water: this is tho fault of all the wells in this station. 6. Conservancy has, as formerly, been carried out on the dry-earth system: Small huts, having their floors covered with a foot of dry earth, are used as latrines, upon the dry earth iron vessels for receiving excreta are placed; the patients do not, as a rule, make use of these vessels, so that the dry' earth floors have to be frequently renewed. 7.

The other was discharged (cured) in 1876, after having been threo months in the Asylum, and remained sane for the greater part of four years, during which ho worked as a domestic servant; in both cases his insanity was brought on by the excessive use of ganja. Of those admitted, 9 were natives of Assam and 13 were from other Provinces; the corresponding figures for the preceding year were 2 and 9. In 12 of tho new admissions the patients had been insane for less and in 10 for more than six months. Tho following table shows that the proportion of those admitted as chronically insane is rapidly decreasing, while the number of admissions for those insane for under six months is nearly double that of any previous year: Of thoi are natives Tears.

One man, a sepoy (non-criminal), Nepali, from the 42nd Regiment, escaped during the year; ho had been in the Asylum for three months, and appeared to have recovered his reason, and would, in all probability, have been discharged in the course of two or three months. The circumstances attending his escape are,that in the night, during a storm, the keeper in charge of this ward got up to look after some jhamps that were slamming; during his absence the sepoy climed over the partition separating the ward from the warder's room, and escaped by pushing aside some of the bamboos forming the palisade. His escape was not noticed until the next morning, when search was made and enquiry set on foot, but he has not been heard of since. 10.

The reversed positions taken up in 1880 by tho figures of admissions to hospital and doaths, as compared with 1879, is not that in ono year moro than another greater caro was shown in the selection of those fit for hospital, but is to a great extent duo to tho fact that out of 7 weakly subjects whom 1 mentioned in last year's report as having contributed moro than half of tho average number sick, 5 (4 males and 1 female) have died during tho year under review, (1 recovered and 1 is still in hospital).

At the post-mortem body was found to bo greatly emaciated, there was much thickening and cicatrization of the large intestine, but no trace of recent disease. (4) Uterine disease.Mussamut Khemi had suffered from amenorrhcea sinco her admission four years ago. The native doctor who made tho post-mortem states that there was extensive ulccration of the womb. (5) Debility.Bhooput had been a long time suffering from general debility with swelling of the feet. No post-mortem was made. (6) Debility.Mnssamut Moyanna, a weakly subject, for a long time a sufferer from menor-rhagia and dyspepsia. The posi-moi'tem merely disclosed great amemic and wasting of tissues and organs. (7) Debility.Melek, admitted at the beginning of tho year, and died on 20th September. During tho nine months that he was in the Asylum he was too weak for any work.

There has been a decrease of Rs. G-13-7 in tho average cost per head for dieting. This was owing to our having purchased provisions at a cheaper rato than in 1879. Under the head of clothing, bazar medicines, and contingencies thero has been a slightly increased expenditure.

Also Resolution on the Report of the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1879. RESOLUTION. 1. The Report submitted by Dr. Warburton shows that the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum has been successfully administered during the year under review. The inspection of the Asylum lately held by the Chief Commissioner confirmed this view, and Mr. Elliott then expressed himself as well satisfied with the management of the Asylum. 2. It was proposed in Sir Steuart Bayley's time to abandon the present site of the Asylum, and to transfer the patients to a ward about to be vacated in the jail. Mr. Elliott however, after inspecting the locality, decided that it would not be advisable to enclose the lunatics within the solid and gloomy walls of the jail buildings, and that the present situation is far more suitable for this class of patients. The site is high, and the place bright and airy. The dormitories are well planned, with dry floors and plenty of ventilation above. The hedge encircling the enclosure has been completed, and the drainage is good. The Asylum, therefore, will not be moved from its present position. o. One alteration, however, in the existing arrangements must be effected ot once : the criminal and non-criminal lunatics are not at present separated from each other, and if any of the criminals were violent and homicidal, a serious catastrophe might occur. It is absolutely necessary that a stockade should be made similar to that by which the female ward is now surrounded, to separate the two classes of male patients, and to provide means of secure confinement for those who are dangerous to others. 4. The general health of the inmates of the Asylum was much better than last year) but there were more deaths. The explanation given of this is that there were a few cases of chronic illness last year, and that during the present year these patients died. 5. The lunatics are employed on gardening and basket-weaving, which are very suitable employments. The women only are found difficult to manage in this respect, as they cannot be induced to spin. Further efforts should be made to teach them this easy art. 6. In paragraph 9 of the Report an account is given of the escape during a storm in the night of a non-criminal lunatic who had recently recovered his reason. Four lunatics in all escaped, and particulars of the escapes of the other three lunatics should have been furnished in the Report. 7. In conclusion, the Chief Commissioner commends the management of the Asylum during the last year, and thanks Dr. Warburton for the care and skill with which he has watched over the welfare of the institution. By order of the Chief Commissioner of Assam, C. J. LYALL, Offg. Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam.

REPORT ON THE TEZPUR LUNATIC ASYLUM, 1881. No. 145D., dated Shillong, the 24th March 1882. FromDr. J. J. Clarke, Deputy-Surgeon-General, H. M.'s Forces, Eastern Frontier District, ToThe Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam. I have the honour to forward the Annual Report on the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for 1881, prepared and submitted by the Superintendent, Surgeon G. A. Warburton. 2. The average population of the Asylum was 5T64, against 45*85 of 1880, and the number of admissions and re-admissions, 24, against 22 of the previous year. Of the year under review 8 were discharged, 7 died, 55 remained, against 13 discharged, 7 died, 40 remained of the year preceding. 3. Of the average population of the Asylum, 51*64, there were 73 admissions to hospital, against 33 admissions, out of a population of 45*85 of 1880. The chief causes of sickness were fevers 29, lung diseases 20, bowel-complaints 14, and more than half the admissions (38) were during the last three months of the year, chiefly from fever and diseases of the respiratory system. The daily average of sick throughout the year was 2*63, against 1*23 of the previous year. There were 7 deaths. 5 of these from chest affections. 1 from debility, 1 from dysentery. The death-rate was 13*55 per cent, of total daily average population, against 15*26 of 1880. Of the 7 persons who died, 3 were admitted to the Asylum during the year, and were at the time of admission in a broken-down state of health; the other 4 were inmates of previous years with debilitated and diseased constitutions. 4. 1 beg to invite attention to the suggestion made by the Superintendent in paragraph 2 of his report, regarding the attendance at the Asylum Committee meetings of the Overseer of the Public Works Department. Such an arrangement would probably facilitate action in the matter of repairs and alterations which the Asylum from time to time requires. It has been finally determined not to abandon the present buildings, and there is, therefore, no need now to delay in carrying out those necessary improvements which have been so long pending. 5. A scheme has been submitted for the provision of more accommodation, so that the criminal lunatics may be separated from the non-criminal. The cells for violent lunatics are to be properly padded, better lighted, and better ventilated. The water-supply, at present in a most unsatisfactory state, is, I understand, at once to claim attention, and cisterns with taps are to be introduced, both for a supply of water for drinking as well as for bathing purposes. G. Of the total population, 51*64, of the Asylum 41*17 have been engaged in suitable employ throughout the year, and of this number 1408 have been employed in manufactures. The income from their labour amounted to Rs. 429-9-9, and this sum has been carried to the credit of the Asylum as net profit, against the net profit of the sum of Rs. 179-5-6 in 1880. 7. The population of the Asylum was greater during the past than in any previous year. The total expenditure, therefore, was greater, namely, Rs. 7,454-1-3, against Rs. 6,874-6-3 of the previous year. But the cost of diet was less per head by Rs. 5-6-4, the total cost of each inmate amounting only to Rs. 48-4-9, against Rs. 53-11-1 in 1880. This decrease in the cost of diet arose from the fall in the general price of provisions. The total cost per head of population was during the vear Us. 141-7-0, against Rs. 143-9-0 of 1880.

ANNUAL RETORT ON THE TEZPUE LUNATIC ASYLUM, 1881. The general arrangements of the Asylum and Asylum grounds have not been changed since last year. In compliance with the Chief Commissioner's orders on the subject of providing accommodation which would separate the criminal from the non-criminal lunatics, I have called in the Overseer in the Public Works Department, and described to him the description of building which I consider most (suitable. The department has since prepared plans and estimates for a new compound and separate buildings for the criminals; but as yet they have not received the sanction of the Commissioner. I These buildings could not have been undertaken during the rains, but they must be commenced and finished before the end of the present cold weather. The huts which I have planned will be somewhat i more substantial and secure than those at present in use, and will have a small verandah running along one side; the criminals, being, as a rule, more powerful, more cunning, and more sane than the non-criminal lunatics, require stronger huts, and, as to the verandahs, I think they should form part of any building in the country where the rains are almost continuous for about six months in the year. 2. The annual repairs have not yet been undertaken; the palisades and huts are kept in order Ibv the lunatics, but we have to purchase materials for the purpose. Our estimates for the cost of the necessary repairs for the present season were sent in in May last, but have not yet been sanctioned, |though we have sent some six reminders. I think it would be well if the Chief Commissioner would I issue an order directing the Overseer of the Public Works Department who may be in charge here to attend at the Asylum Committee meetings: his advice might possibly be useful, and with his assistance the Superintendent would be able to see that the Asylum be kept in its proper state of repair. We I have now placed boulders under the earthen floors of all the huts, and will not again have to 'complain of removable dampness. 3. The drainage has been very good, the boulder drains have answered well, and the grounds | have been as dry as it is possible for them to be during the rains, in a climate such as that of Assam. 4. The increased hospital accommodation called for by the Chief Commissioner in his inspection notes of the 1st November last, will be provided as soon as possible, I think this might be done by extending one of the small female huts, one end being provided for the few female patients, and the other being I kept for the non-violent class of female lunatics; the female keepers' room being placed in the centre. The Public Works Department will be called upon to furnish an estimate for the repadding and repairing of the cells. The padding must be covered with leather, and not, as formerly, with canvas, which the I lunatics very soon tear into pieces, with which they might do themselves harm. The ventilation of | those cells is very bad, and new openings for the admission of air must be made. 5. As noted by the Deputy-Surgoon-General and the Chief Commissioner during their late inspections, the condition of the water-supply is not satisfactory. The wells, never sufficiently deep, are filling in; they also appear to be badly constructed; during the rains water pours in through holes in the packing and bricks near the surface. I have recently made a qualitative analysis of the well-water, and have found it to be of indifferent quality. 6. The conservancy is the same as formerly, it is on the dry-earth system and works well; the excreta, well mixed with earth, are removed to a distance and hoed in. The ground, so used, is kept under cultivation, and is so situated that it is on a lower level than the wells, and its sub-soil drainage flows towards the hollas below the Asylum grounds, and away from the writer-supply. 7. All the remarks made by the Deputy-Surgeon-General and Chief Commissioner during their late inspections have been carefully noted, and the Public Works Department have been furnished with copies of these remarks, and have been asked to take in hand as soon as possible the new buildings for criminal lunatics, the hospital for females, the re-padding of the cells, and the deepening of the wells. 8.

4 REPORT ON THE TEZPUR LUNATIC ASYLUM. The number, 46, remaining from the previous year was greater by 2 than in 1880, but the saino both as regards males and females, as in 1871). The number of admissions and re-admissions, 24,1$ as will be seen from the foregoing table, almost the same as in the four preceding years, with the exception of 1879. Of the re-admissions, one, Budhi Sheik, accused of committing grievous hurt was, upon recovering his reason, sent to Dhubri to stand his trial, and, having been acquitted on the grounds of insanity, was, by the orders of the Chief Commissioner, re-admitted into the Asylum, to be kept under observation for, and reported upon at the end of, six months: tlio report will be due during the course of the present month. He has since his trial shown no signs of insanity. The other re-admission was a female, named Champa, who has been subject to periodic fits of insanity for the past ten or fifteen years, and who, before the opening of the Lunatic Asylum, had been frequently sent to the jail for safe keeping; she had only been discharged from the Asylum for a period of twenty days when it was found necessary to re-admit her. Of the 24 admissions 18 wore natives of Assam and six were from other Provinces, as against 0 and 13 for 1880 and 2 and 9 for 1879. Of the new admissions, 15 had been insane for less, and 7 for more, than six months.

During the year under review two lunatics succeeded in getting away from the Asylum, but weWj shortly afterwards recaptured. One of these, Barespatee, was herding the Asylum cattle in an adjoining field, and was missing in the evening. The other, Mingaloo, was taken with others to bathe in the ^ ' O it &laquo; I Mora Borelli, when he managed to conceal himself in the jungle, and make his escape to his villas' in Mangaklai, where he was recaptured by the police and sent back to the Asylum after an absence ot 15 days.

Occupation, fyo. (Statement No. 4).- -This table simply shows that in an agricultural country little more than one-third of thoso admitted are agriculturists, the reason being that the agriculturists who ln;ty become insane are, as a rule, taken care of by their friends, and few, except those who are friendless, come to the Asylum; for the same reason it is that we can so seldom find any friends to take off our hands those who may become harmless.

As might be expected, the discharges cured are proportionately greater, and the death-rate less among the acute than among the less robust chronic cases. The greatest mortality is among those suffering from chronic dementia; out of 10 admissions, there have been 10 deaths. 17. Alleged causes of insanity (Statement No. 7).In 9 cases only is the cause of insanity known; of these, 1 is supposed to be due to grief, 1 to spirit-drinking, 2 to ganja-smoking, 2 to jealousy, and 3 to the excessive use of opium. Of the 15 unknown we have found since admission that 2 had been in the habit of consumimg opium and 2 ganja in large quantities; nearly all the males have been accustomed to more or less opium or ganja. Since tho Asylum was established, 50 were admitted whose insanity was supposed to be due to the excessive use of opium (0), spirits (12), and ganja (32); of the remainder, in 2 cases fever is supposed to have been the cause, in 4 jealousy, in 8 epilepsy, and in 11 grief. In 93 cases tho cause is not known, or only suspected; of these a great number have been insane so long that their history has been forgotten. (3 (4 18.

The admissions into hospital and the daily average of sick were, in proportion to the population, about double those of 1880, and about equal to 1879. Of the 73 admissions, 38 were sent to hospital during the last three months of the year. The largo increase is almost entirely due to the greater number of admissions for fever and diseases of the respiratory system, the latter including ordinary coughs and catarrhs.

As might be expected, he spent a good deal of his time in hospital. 79 days before his death he had an attack of bronchitis, this was followed by phthisis, from which he did not recover. Postmortem.Great emaciation, very large spleen, large fatty liver, and slightly advanced phthisis at apex of left lung. (2) Hcemoptysis.Girish was admitted to the Asylum at the end of 1877, he was then in a bad state, suffering from partial paralysis, but subsequently improved as regards his general health, but never recovered the complete use of his limbs. For about a year before he died he suffered a good deal from congestion of the liver and haemoptysis. Post-mortem (made by the Native Doctor).Much emaciation, pericardium contained much fluid, thorax cavity full of fluid, liver and spleen much enlarged, many worms in the intestines. (3) Pneumonia.Metloo came to the Asylum at the end of September 1879, he was in good health, but refused food, and had to be fed by others. He was attacked with acute double pneumonia on the 22nd September, and died after being in hospital eleven days. Post-viortem.Both lungs much congested, spleen enlarged, worms in the intestines. (4) Pneumonia.Beni came from Gauhati on 27th July 1881, was admitted in bad health, suffering from syphilis and dyspepsia. On the 21st October he was attacked with acute double pneumonia, from which he died on the 10th day after having been admitted to hospital. Post-mortem.Both lungs much congested. (5) Chronic Bronchitis.Kopilla was sent here from Mangaldai in Juno last, he was then suffering from chronic bronchitis, dyspepsia, and enlarged spleen. He was treated in hospital, and for a time cured of the bronchitis : the disease, however, returned and carried him off early in November. The post-mortem was badly made by the Native Doctor, and his description of the post-mortem appearances are not to be relied upon. (6) Debility. Indrojit, an idiot sent from Dibrugarh in July 1878. Since his arrival hero he lias had a number of diseases, among others dyspepsia, diarrhoea, piles, and dysentery. He died in September. The post-mortem disclosed great aiucmia and wasting of tissues and organs. (7) Dysentery,Mussaraut Govindee came from Lakhimpur in August 1881, and was admitted in very bad health, suffering general debility, with swelling of the feet and dyspepsia. She had an attack of acute dysentery on the 28th November and died after an illness of nine days. Post-mortem showed thickening,-, ulceration, and sloughing of the large intestines. 20.

8 REPORT ON TIIE TEZPUR LUNATIC ASYLUM. The increase under tlie head of establishment is due to one chaukidar and one jamaddr having been added to the establishment and to the pay of the warders and overseer having beon increased. The average cost of diet was less by Rs. 5-6-4 than in 1880, this is owing to a lowering in the prices of dhall, rice, fish, and oil. The ordinary diet scale is Rice......................................................... IX chittacks per man per day.

The lunatics are again gaining weight, and there are none on the sick list. During the year under review we purchased 110 blankets from the Bhaugulpnr Jail at a cost of Rs. 227-4, against 60, of an inferior quality, at a cost of Ks. 99-5-3, in 1880. We had also to procure new beds and beddings at a cost of Rs. 61. More clothing, and at higher rates, was bought from the jail. Under the heads of bazar medicines, contingencies, and manufactures there has been a decreased expenditure at the rate of Rs. 3-3-9 per head. 21. Sanctioned establishment (Statement No. 10).A proposal to increase the number and pay of the establishment was favourably considered in 1880, but the proposed changes only took place at the beginning of the year under review, and consisted in adding one chaukidar and one jamaddr to the old staff, and increasing the pay of the warders from Us. 8 to Rs.10, of the Compounder from Rs. 10 to 12, and of the overseer from Rs. 30 to Us. 50 per mensem.

Resolution on the Report on the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for 1881. Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner of Assam in the General Department^No, 2,023, dated Shillong, the 17th May 1882. Read- The Annual Report on tlio Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for tlio year 1881. Also letter No. 145 1)., dated Shillong, the 24th March 1882, from the Deputy-Snrgcon-General, Jliastern Frontier District, to the Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam, forwarding the above Report. Also Resolution on tho Report of the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1880. RESOLUTION. The statistics of the Asylum are fairly satisfactory. The numbers have increased, being 55 at the end of the year, against 46 at the beginning, but of the admissions less than one-third are believed to be chronically insane. There were 7 deaths daring the year, the same number as in 18b0, but out of a larger population, and the average daily number of sick was 2'63. 2. It is observed that of the two re-admissions, one, a woman, was re-admitted only twenty days alter she had been discharged as cured. Should such a fact (which prima facie seems to show an error of judgment on the part of the releasing visitors) occur again, it should be specially noticed, and explained in the Report. 3. The cost per head of each patient was less than in 1SS0, though the greater cheapness of food was to some extent balanced by the increased establishment. The patients were more usefully employed than, before ; they raked Rs. 331-6 worth of vegetables in the garden, and made baskets which sold for Rs. 70 ; there was il;-i. 20 worth of arrowroot in store at the end of the year. Of the milk they consumed, Rs. 137-12 worth was supplied by the Asylum's cows. These figures make up a total of Rs. 559-2, not Rs. 5U0-3-9, as shown in Statement 11. Of the cash received for baskets (Rs, 70) Rs. 4.0 were paid into the Treasury and Rs. 30 are unaccounted for. Rs. GO were alsoieeeived from paying patients. The total cash expenditure was, according to Statment 9, Rs. 7,451-1-3; and, deducting the Rs. 100 received, the cash expenditure was Rs. 7,354-1-3. The Comptroller will be asked to verify this statement; and in future the Superintendent should obtain his countcrsignature to Statement 9 before submitting it. 4. When the Chief Commissioner visited the Asylum, in April 1881, he objected to the absence of any arrangements for segregating the criminal from the non-criminal lunatic population ; and he also directed steps to be taken to deepen the well, which is now liable to run dry, and to provide a tank in which the patients should bathe and wash. More than a year has now elapsed, but nothing whatever has been done to carry out these orders. 5. The Deputy-Surgeon-General suggests that an overseer of the Public Works Department should attend the Committee meetings to take orders as to work to be done. The Chief Commissioner thinks this is unnecessary. It is the Superintendent's business to push forward and carry through whatever has to be done in the Asylum. In matters requiring skilled labour, such as the deepening of the well anil the construction of a masonry tank, he would require assistance from the District Engineer; but such other work as repairs to huts, building new huts, erecting a stockaded partition between the two classes of lunatics, and constructing a padded cell, do not require professional aid, and should be carried out by the Superintendent himself. By order of the Chief Commissioner of Assam, C. J. LYALL, Offg. Secy, to the Chief Commr. of Assam.

REPORT ON THE TEZPER LUNATIC ASYLUM, 1883. No. 295C, dated Shillong, the 25th March 1884. FromA. Eteson, Esq., m.d., Deputy-Surgeon-General, Eastern Frontier District, ToThe Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam. I have the honour to forward the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum Report for 1883, prepared and submitted to this office by the Superintendent, Surgeon R. Neil Campbell, M.B. 2. The first section deals with the improvements which have been effected during the year, and from which the hygiene of the lunatics will, it is hoped, be more favourably developed. The improvements are (a) The building of two new wards. (&) Separation of criminal from non-criminal lunatics, (c) Asphalt coping to the wells. (ci) Better ventilation and lighting to the solitary cells. (e) Plantation of trees and bamboos. (/) The excavation of a tank which has long been recommended as necessary to drainage. 3. It is satisfactory to note that the accommodation has now been increased, so that in the male wards there is room for 30 more patients than have been at any time present during the year. Overcrowding should never be permitted in Asylums. 4. On the 1st January there were 61 inmates, viz., 44 males and 17 females. During the year the population was added to by 32 ; of whom 27 were fresh admissions, viz., 22 males and 5 females ; and 5, inclusive of 1 female, were re-admissions. The re-admissions were of 3 relapsed patients and 2 escaped inmates. Of the total 93, 1 escaped, 11 were discharged, 14 died, and 67 remained on the 31st December. These figures give a larger average population for 1883 than in any previous year. It will also be remembered that 1882 had a similar increased average over 1881. The term is too brief to draw any conclusions as to the causes of such an increase in lunacy in the province ; but the statistics should be carefully watched. 5. I regret to observe that the medical history of the Asylum for the year is unfavourable. An epidemic of cholera appeared in June which lasted three weeks. During that time there were 20 cases and 9 deaths. This has weighted the mortality considerably ; but in addition there were 5 deaths from general causes. Hence the mortality during the year readied a very grave percentage of 21'95, or, in a more general method of computation, 219 5 per mille. In 1876 and 1877 the deaths reached 258-6 and 366'6 per mille ; but the average for 1878-82 was only 91 per mille. 6. The admissions into hospital were at the rate of 1,976 per mille ; the female lunatics having a higher average than the male. The total admissions for the year were 126. A catalogue of the diseases is given for the first time, and I am struck, in reading them over, to see such a large proportion of grave disease affecting the inmates. Probably the past condition of neglect and exposure to which the unfortunate inmates have been subject before admission to the Asylum had a tendency to originate or reproduce such diseases indicative of chronic innutrition. The daily average of sick, 3T3, is an increase on 1882 (2*24), also on 1881 (2-63), and more so on 1880 (1-23), but without a ratio per cent, or per thousand these figures are of small value, for a varying strength may iiccount for much of the difference. 7. An examination of the several tables devoted to statistics, religion, residence, occupation, age of inmates, does not appear to call for remark. The Superintendent notes the unusual circumstances of so few lunatics being admitted under age, and the small proportion over 40 years ; but he gives no suggestion as to the cause of the exception in the two classes. It would be well to have it enquired into and mentioned next year. 8. Of the causes to which insanity is attributed in 18 ascertained cases, no less than 8 are attributed to gavja, while opium is credited with one patient only. Considering how very generally opium-eating as a habit' exists in this Province, 1 am surprised its
REPORT ON THE TEZPUR LUNATIC ASYLUM. effects are not more displayed in this institution. The common opinion in Europe of opium-eating is that it always ends by rendering the victim an imbecile. I should be glad if the Superintendent would remark next year on the custom in the Asylum of continuing opium to patients (I believe it is at his discretion to prescribe it), and whether in practice it can be discontinued with benefit to the existing insanity. Similarly, the effects of discontinuing ganja in a medical point of view might be usefully noted. 9. The types of mental disease affecting these unfortunate people (para. 15) do not hold out much prospect of perfect recovery in a large proportion of cases. It is stated in the report that the discharges have been only after acute affections, and this is what must be expected. The statement that the bulk of the inmates are cases of acute mania and dementia and melancholia is probably a mistake ; what is meant is chronic mania, with temporary or periodical excitement, dementia, and melancholia: and these are, as a rule, very hopeless of cure ; though the last two classes are frequently not troublesome, and can be often educated to be useful. 10. Of the cholera epidemic I write with reserve, as I was not in administrative charge of the district last year, and I am aware how difficult it is to recommend sanitary measures from a distance, especially among the inmates of an Asylum. But when cholera has been plainly established and the locality is affected, some effort should be made to remove the Asylum inmates, or at all events most of them, to another locality which is presumably unaffected. The narrative shows that the cases of cholera occurred day after day for nearly three weeks, and to arrest the epidemic by dispersing the inmates was advisable not only in respect of the lunatics themselves, but more so even out of regard for the general population in the vicinity. Suitable quarters for temporary occupation should not be difficult to find in a sadr station like Tezpur. 11. I had the advantage of visiting the Asylum in January last, and I could not fail to remark the great care evinced by Dr. Campbell in his treatment and superintendence of the lunatics, his close attention to every detail of their comfort and sanitary condition, and his thought for such moral and simple mental exercise as suited the inmates: the more they are kept in healthful agricultural labour and exercised in the improvement of their own dwellings and food-stuffs, the better they are likely to be both in health and temper. 12. I have not dwelt much on the statistics in this review of the report for 1883. I note that in general they are satisfactory, the exception being a recurrence (from epidemic disease) to the unfavourable rates of mortality which prevailed at the opening of the Asylum in 1876-77. I trust this will be better guarded against in future. But in fact the statistics are growing very cumbersome and unwieldy from the practice of accumulating the figures of each year since the Asylum was established. With the Chief Commissioner's approval, I propose to direct the Superintendent to give statistics of the current year, followed by those of the previous year, and a comparison with an average of the previous five and ultimately ten years, as is done in the reports of the Sanitary Commissioner with the Government of India. It is the safest way to draw conclusions where either large or small statistics are to be reviewed. 13. This annual report has been somewhat delayed in its preparation. The present is the first which has been forwarded by Dr. Campbell, and some allowance should be made for his inexperience. It had to be returned for correction. The completed forms finally reached me only four days ago. 4. j j are now t 5. 1 I chiefly us&lt; | two patiei 1 used for n 6. 1 has been &lt; 7.

But &gt;ractice of the Chief ics of the l with an reports of r to draw lie present should be ited forms ANNUAL REPORT ON THE TEZPUR LUNATIC ASYLUM FOR THE YEAR 1883. During the past year the chief improvements which have been carried out are (a) The building of two new wards for criminal lunatics, which entirely does away .with any overcrowding at present. Criminal lunatics are now kept separate from non-criminal at night, though during, the day, while at work or at meals, they are together. These new wards are in a separate enclosure, and can afford accommodation for over thirty insanes. One of these wards has been bouldered, and the other will be bouldered in the early part of 1884. (6) The wells have had their platforms made of asphalt, which will not so easily be destroyed by the insanes dashing down their lotas as the pucca was. (c) The annual repairs have been carried out, as is always done, but, besides that, three wards have had their walls made of bamboos instead of ekra, thereby strengthening the buildings and rendering escapes much more difficult. (d) The solitary cells, not padded cells, as the Committee of Visitors did not consider such necessary, have been better ventilated and lighted. The windows have been enlarged, and they have been protected by sunshades so as to prevent any glare. {e) A good many trees have been planted, and roots of bamboos, which will be of great use, especially the latter, if they will grow. (r) A tank has been commenced, and it is hoped that this may be finished in the early part of 1884. 2. Accommodation.There is now sufficient accommodation for at least one hundred insanes, and as the number treated has not reached seventy, there is no overcrowding. 3. Clothing.This has always been sufficient and suitable for the season. This and also the bedding are difficult to look after, as the insanes are very destructive. Good blankets and blanket-coats were obtained from Bhagulpur Jail. 4. Drainage.This is good and suitable, though only kutcha, for the site is high. All the wards are now bouldered, except one of the criminal wards. 5. Hospital accommodation.There is a small building which can be used as such, though it is chiefly used as an office. A small ward has been made into three separate rooms, which can each hold two patients, and anyone suffering from chronic disease or chest affections is kept here. This is only used for male patients. Females are treated in their own wards. There are separate wards. 6. Water-supply.Two wells are in use. The water is good. A tank, as already mentioned, has been commenced for gardening and washing. 7. Conservancy is the same as described in former reports. 8. All the remarks made by visitors have been noted, and any improvements or changes proposed have been, as far as possible, carried out. 9. Admissions, Discharges, fyc. {Statement 2).There were six more patients remaining at the beginning of 1883 than at the beginning of 1882. The number of admissions and re-admissions was also greater than in any previous year: 1876. 1877. 1878. 1879. M. F. T. M. F. T. M. F. T. M. F. T.

Also letter No. 295, dated the 25th March 1883, from the Deputy-Surgeon-General of the Eastern Frontier District to the Secretary to the Chief Commissioner, forwarding the Report. RESOLUTION. The report on this Asylum is due from the Deputy-Surgeon-General on the 1st Febru-ary. It was received in the Secretariat in manuscript on the 26th March only. It is explained that it was necessary to return the report to Dr. Campbell for correction, and Dr. Eteson also represents that the statistics have become &quot; cumbersome and unwieldy from the practice of accumulating the figures of each year since the Asylum was established.&quot; The form of the Annual Statements I. and II. appended to the report was prescribed in the Government of India Resolution in the Home Department, No. 7419-428, dated the 31st August 1874, and it provides for the statistics of the ten years preceding the year under report being shown. No difficulty should be found in entering these statistics in Statements I. and II. It is not, however, necessary for the Superintendent to give in the body of his report detailed figures for each year during which the Asylum has been in existence, as Dr. Campbell has done, and in future reports a comparison of the figures of the year under report with the figures of the preceding year, and with an average of the previous five years, and ultimately of the previous ten years, will answer all purposes. 2. There were 61 patients in the Asylum on the 1st January 1883. During the year there were 27 new admissions and 5 re-admissions (3 of which were re-admissions of relapsed patients and 2 were captures of escaped patients), or 32 persons admitted in all, against 22 in 1882; 1 patient escaped, 9 were discharged cured, 2 were made over to friends, and 14 died during the year, and there remained on the 31st December 67 patients, of whom 49 were men and 18 were women. The daily average strength was 63*76 in 1883, against 56*53 in 1882. The mortality of the year was lamentable; 9 deaths were due to the epidemic of cholera in June last, but there were also 5 deaths from general causes. There were but 3 deaths in 1882, and 7 in 1881. The daily average number of sick was 3*13, among an average strength of 63*76; this rate is not remarkably high, but the Deputy-Surgeon-General notices the large proportion of grave diseases indicative of former chronic innutrition, and this helps to explain the high rate of mortality. 3. Dr. Eteson expresses surprise at the fact that in only one of 18 cases in the Asylum in which the causes of insanity are said to have been ascertained is the loss of reason attributed to opium. The whole population of the Tezpur Asylum is, perhaps, too small, containing as it does only one-tenth of the insane persons in the Assam Valley districts as they were returned in the Census of 1881, to afford a sound basis for generalisations, especially where, as in this instance, the facts which are said to have been ascertained relate to a portion only of the Asylum population. As, however, was noticed in Chapter XI. of the Assam Census Report of 1881, it is not the case that the districts of the Province in which most opium, ganja, and country spirits are consumed are those which show the highest ratios of insanity. Of the two nearly equal populations of the in 1882-83, tho snrmA vaiwy consumed Assam Valley and the Surma Valley, the former con- 55 maunds, and tlio Assam Valley districts 1 &laquo; , j 1 j_ii 1 i,658 maunus..f opium. sumes thirty times as much opium as the latter popula- tion; but in the Census of 1881 the proportion of insanes per 10,000 of the population has been returned as 3*1 in the Surma Valley, against 2*1 in the Assam Valley. 4. The Chief Commissioner has been glad to observe that much has been done during the year for the greater comfort of the patients. Of the improvements which have been effected, and which are enumerated by Dr. Eteson, the most important are the two new barracks which have been built ; the digging of the tank was begun but not completed during the year. The visitors decided, after consulting the authorities of the Presidency Asylum, who stated that padded cells were unknown in the Presidency Asylum, that it was unnecessary to have padded cells.
( 2 ) 5. The total expenditure of the Asylum on establishment, diet, clothing, contingencies, and bazar medicines during the year was Rs. 8,420-2-4 in cash drawn from the treasury. The receipts of the Manufacture Department were Ks. 909-15-3, viz., from sale of baskets Rs. 160, and Rs. 749-15-3 the value of garden produce. Of the garden produce, the greater portion, valued at Rs. 574-15-3, was consumed by the patients, and the remainder was sold to the public. The cash receipts paid into the treasury amounted in all to Rs. 335, as against Rs. 205 paid into the treasury in 1882. The average cost of each patient for the year is shown as Rs. 145-11-9, as against Rs. 142-6 for 1882. The figure for 1882, however, was obtained by dividing the total sum drawn in cash from the treasury by the average strength, while that for 1883 has been obtained by dividing the total sum drawn from the treasury, plus the value of the vegetables received from the garden. The manner of calculation adopted for 1882 shows more correctly the cost of each patient to the State; and, calculated in this way, the cost of each patient for 1883 for establishment, diet, clothing, contingencies, and bazar medicines appears to have been Rs. 132-1-3, * which is a saving on the preceding year. In the report for neither year, however, has the Superintendent reported the cost of work done for the Asylum by the Public Works Department, and by convict labour. This information should be obtained from the District Engineer and from the Jail Department for future reports. 6. The Chief Commissioner inspected the Asylum in 7th January 1884, and agrees in Dr. Eteson's commendation of the skill and humanity with which it is managed by Dr. Campbell.

ANNUAL REPORT ON THETEZPUR LUNATIC ASSYLUM, 1884. No. 227C, dated Shillotig, the 24th February 1885. FromDr. A. Eteson, Deputy-Surgeon-General, Eastern Frontier District, ToThe Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam. I have the honour to forward the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum Report for 1884, prepared by the Superintendent, Surgeon R. Neil Campbell, m.h. 2. 'Hie Report and Tables were received in this office on the 27th January, but on examination the details were in several instances found incomplete. It was returned for correction, and received back and accepted on the 21st current. 3. There has been little change made in the internal economy of the institution during the year; the average number of inmates has decreased from 63 to 59, the admissions having been 6 less and the discharged 13 more in 1884. The mortality has decreased from 14 to 8. 4. The medical history of the Asylum, although not so favourable ns formerly, shows an improvement on the figures of 1883. It will be remembered that there was a sustained epidemic of cholera resulting in 9 deaths in the latter year. The disease reappeared on the 24th June, and 5 cases occurred up to the 26th, when the attacks ceased. Of these 5 sick persons 2 died and 3 recovered. The first case is reported to have been a chaukidar, who spent the day in his village three and a half miles off, where cholera was prevalent. Dr. Campbell infers that the chaukidar contracted cholera in his village, and that it was &quot;imported&quot; through him into the Asylum. But the evidence is meagre and inconclusive; Dr. Campbell should study the recent publication by the Sanitary Commissioner withthe Government of India on the facts of cholera in India as opposed to inferences. It was in accordance with precedent that cholera should re-appear in a locality where the disease had been epidemic the year before, and had been allowed to take its course unchecked by removal of the affected population. The return of vital statistics for June 1884 shows four deaths in Tezpur town, and 173 deaths in the thana from cholera. 5. I cannot say the preventive measures adopted altogether commend themselves to my judgment either to obviate future risk, or to give those attacked a better chance of recovery, or to check the spread of the disease at the time. If the removal of the sick chaukidar was a benefit, as claimed, why wrere not all the cholera inmates transferred to a temporary hospital outside the Asylum precincts? The treatment of these patients within the Asylum is contrary to sanitary principles; and, if continued year after year, the institution may become a permanently-infected locality, and may have to be abandoned. A temporary shed should be put together within convenient distance outside the Asylum and afterwards burnt. No more difficulty should be experienced in doing this for an Asylum than for a jail. Burning sulphur, except in closed rooms, can have no appreciable effect ; and under all circumstances its benefit is doubtful. No intimation of this cholera epidemic of 1884 was made to me. I only heard of it when I visited the Asylum in December. 6. Besides cholera, there were also 7 deaths from general disease, viz., phthisis 3, general debility and dysentery 4, which bring the total mortality to 135 per mille of population, and to 380 per mille of admissions into hospital. These are grave records. Much is to be urged in respect of the bad health in which so many inmates are received, and also that with so limited a population fluctuation of rates will often he extreme; but the total of 66 deaths on 243 admissions, since the Asylum was opened eight years ago, gives the high figure of 271 per thousand. Dr. Campbell has added notes on the physical condition of many of the insanes to show that they had on admission already contracted fatal disease from want and exposure in their previous forlorn state. 7. The statistics of daily sickness in the Asylum certainly bear out the contentions that the extraordinary mortality is not caused by want of proper care, food, clothing, &c, Within the precincts. An admission rate of 1,486 per thousand and a daily average &#9632;sick of 22 per thousand cannot be considered excessive among a population who may be considered primarily diseased as a body; and the type of ailment from which the lunatics suffer is only that of the ordinary population.
REPORT ON THE TEZPUR LUNATIC ASYLUM. 8. It will be observed that out of 21 admissions into the Asylum during the year, only 6 were natives of the Province from the immediately contiguous districts of Darrang and Nowgong; while the remaining 15 are foreigners from other parts of India, and presumably chiefly from imported labourers. 9. What are the &quot; other castes &quot; which furnish so large a proportion of the inmates ? Are they hill tribes ? 10. The types of insanity and the alleged causes of insanity do not furnish any ground for comment. 11. The finances of the Asylum appear to be under careful supervision, and to be very economically managed. The average cost of administration for each patient is undoubtedly high; but this will remain so while the Asylum has only half its accommodation utilised. On this point, it would be well to enquire whether the insanes of the Surma Valley cannot also be sent to Tezpur instead of to Dacca. Communication in Assam is rapidly advancing in convenience, and the annual provincial debit to Bengal for charge of the Dacca inmates is very large. 12. The system of averages for preceding years has now been introduced, and will increase in value with each added period. I recommend that the statistics should be prepared per thousand and not per cent., and without decimals. 13. Special addenda to the Report give details of sugar cultivation and a narrative of the cholera outbreak. 14. I have twice visited the Asylum during 1884; and, as before, I have every reason to be satisfied with the way the duties are conducted by Dr. Campbell and the subordinate staff. The food is especially good, the barracks comfortable, the grounds neat, agreeable, and clean, the clothing suitable, and the Superintendent perfectly conversant with all details of the Asylum economy and with the character and conduct of the inmates. 15. I particularly recommend a temporary hospital for cholera outside the main gate.

All the wards are now bouldered. All the wards are being changed from ekra and mud walling to bamboo and matting, which is more durable, and in the end cheaper, as it cannot be destroyed whenever an insane gets a wild fit. The tank, which was commenced last year, was nearly finished during the year, but it still requires to be deepened. 2. Accommodation.This is the same as last year. There is sufficient accommodation for almost double the average population. 3. Clothing and Bedding.This is good and suited to the season. Blankets and blanket coats were obtained from Bhagulpur Jail for the cold season; whilst summer-clothing and tat bedding were obtained from the Tezpur Jail. 4. Drainage.The drainage is good. No water lodges anywhere. The site is high and dry. 5. Hospital Accommodation.For slight ailments patients are treated in the wards. The small building used as an office has a second room, in which very serious cases were treated, so as to be constantly under supervision. There is also a small ward divided into three compartments, where weak patients, or those suffering from diseases of the respiratory system, are kept. When there was an outbreak of cholera, one of the two criminal barracks was used as a hospital, and all the criminal lunatics removed to the non-criminal compound. 6. Water-supply.There are two wells used for drinking and washing purposes. During the cholera outbreak only the river water was used. As a rule, all the insanes bathe in the Mora Bhoroli, about half-a-mile from the Asylum. The tank which has been made is now dry, but while the water lasted it was used for watering the garden. I hope the tank will be deepened this year, so asjjto have water all the year round. 7. Conservancy.This is the same as has been described in former reports. The dry earth system is in force and works well. 8. Admissions, Discharges, &c. (Statement No. I.).During the year 17 males and 4 females were admitted, 18 males and 7 females discharged.

Sickness and mortality (Statement No. 8).Sickness will always be considerable in an |Asylum, and will depend greatly on the class of patient admitted. The mortality in great measure 'Spends on the state of the new admissions. The reason sickness and mortality depend so greatly on the state of the new admission is of course the exposure the insane is liable to and the debilitated state he is in from inattention to proper food, jclothing, and cleanliness. This year has been an unfortunate year in this way, as may be seen from ^e following notes. Out of 21 admissions, eight wore in a bad state of health : (a) AN/EMic and Dropsical.Admitted 1st May, improved under treatment, made over to friends 25th August. (o) Phthisis.Lived one month and one day. (c) Chronic Dysentery, Phthisis.Had to bo fed by nutrient enomata, lived one month and 28 days. 20 uring 1884, T. 11 3 21 152 25 4 62 243

REPORT on OUTBREAK of CHOLERA in thb TEZPUR LUNATIC ASYLUM in 1884. The first case occurred on the 24th June. A criminal lunatic, Jatho Sang, was suddenly taken ill with symptoms of cholera and died after a few hours' illness. On enquiry it was found that one of the chaukidars, named Goonai, was also in a collapsed state, and had suffered from cholera for two or three days previously. The chaukidar I had removed to the dispensary, where he died a few hours later. ( There was no cholera in the police lines or close to the Asylum, but there was cholera at the time in the bazar near the charitable dispensary, a mile-and-a-half distant, as also in Goonai's village about three-and-a-half miles off. Goonai was the night chaukidar, and spent the day at his home, where he must have caught tho disease and imported it into the Asylum. On tho 24th the second case also occurred, which recovered. On the 25th the third and the 26th the fourth case, all of whom recovered. After this no more cases occurred. The preventive measures which were used, and which were so successful, not only in preventing other cases but in rendering those attacked more amenable to treatment, were (1) The chaukidar Goonai was removed to the Charitable Dispensary, where he died. (2) Jattoo Sang, criminal insane, was placed in one of the criminal wards on the south-east side. apart from all the insanes, and the other criminal insanes placed with the non-criminal. (3) Each case of cholera as it occurred was removed to this barrack. (4) Sulphur fires were burned thrice in the twenty-four hours in all the wards, first closing ail the doors. (5) Thrice daily all the insanes were paraded and 15 minims of dilute sulphuric acid, with one ounce of water, given to each. (6) The water in the well having nearly dried up, only river water was used for drinking purposes. (7) Wherever a case of cholera occurred, six inches of earth was removed from the flooring of the ward and conveyed to a distance and new earth put down and leaped over. Altogether, there were five cases of cholera, i.e., one chaukidar and four insanes, of which the first two were fatal and the last three recovered. R. N. Campbell, m.b., Superintendent, Tezpur Lunatic Asylum. The 5th January 1885. REPORT on SUGARCANE CULTIVATION in the TEZPUR LUNATIC ASYLUM. The size of the land under cultivation is 1 bigha 4 cottas 17 lashas and 3 coras. This land was hoed by the insanes, and all the planting, cutting, crushing, &c, was also carried out by insane labour. The total production of this land was 352 bundles of canes, containing 50 canes in each bundle. This was cut in March and April. From these 265^ ghurras of juice were obtained, which, on being boiled down, produoed 29 ghurras of gur, each ghurra containing an average of 15 seers, valued at 4 annas a seer, or Rs. 3-12 per ghurra. Besides the gur obtained, 155 bundles of cane-root wore gathered, each bundle containing 50 roots. Of these 2,000 were sold at &s- 2 per 1,000, though I believe -R&- 3 might have been obtained. Of the remaining 5,000, some were used for a new clearance, which is looking very well, and will be ready for cutting in three months. The means used to express the juice was simply one of the ordinary country mills worked by the insanes, which was hired at a total cost of ls- 7-2. The amount of profit may be calculated as follows: Ea. As. P. 435 seers gur at 4 annas per seer 7,750 roots of cane at Bb. 2 per 1,000 Total . 108 12 15 8 0 0 124 4 0 7 2 24 0 31 2 0 0 0 From this must bo deducted the cost of hire of mill Original coBt of cane Total It is impossible to calculate the value of the labour, as it is not possible to work insanes as ordinary labour in many cases. The sugarcane is of two kinds, teli and mogh. Of the two mogh is the better. Besides the above crop, 1 am just, going to take the second crop off the same land, so that I think the sugarcane cultivation may be considered a very profitable experiment, and one which the insanes like, as they eat a good part of the cane.

Resolution on the Report of the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for 1884. Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner of Assam, in the General Department, No. 1,892, dated the 25th March 1885. Read The Annual Report on the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1884. Also Letter No. 227C, dated the 24th February 1885, from the Deputy-Surgeon-General of the Eastern Frontier District, to the Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam. RESOLUTION. fc* . 1 &quot;* &#9632;&raquo; &laquo;**&quot; : 1 &quot; : s s- : : 1* The Report on this Asylum, which is due on the 1st February, was received in manuscript by the Secretariat office on the 24th February. It is explained that it was necessary to return the report to Dr. Campbell for correction, as the details in several instances were found incomplete. 2. There were 67 patients in the Asylum on the 1st January 1884. Twenty-one new cases were admitted during the year, as compared with 27 in 1883; 15 patients were discharged as cured, 7 were made over to friends, and 8 died during the year. Fifty-five patients remained on the 31st December, of whom 42 were males and 13 females. The mortality has fallen from 14 to 8, while the daily average strength was 59*21, against 63'76 in 1883. There was one death from cholera among the patients during the year. A special report has been supplied by Dr. Campbell on the outbreak of this disease in 1884, and the measures which he then adopted. The Deputy-Surgeon-General does not accept the conclusion that the disease was imported from the native town to the Asylum, and disapproves to some extent of the sanitary arrangements made by the Superintendent. It is, however, satisfactory to notice that after the death of the first patient no fatal case occurred in the Asylum. The daily average number of sick was 2*27, against 3*13 in 1883. Dr. Campbell attributes the great mortality among the Tezpur Asylum lunatics to the impoverished condition of the inmates at the time of their admission. An analysis is given in his report of eight cases received during the year, which shows that many of the insanes had contracted fatal disease before their arrival at the Asylum. The statistics of sickness show that the patients suffer from the ordinary ailments common throughout the Province, and the excessive mortality is not due to any fault in the attention given to their comforts in the Asylum. Natives of Assam formed 28 per cent, only of the admissions during the year, the majority of the patients being natives of Bengal. The Chief Commissioner is glad to observe that due care has been given to conservancy arrangements, that the quality of the food is good, and that the premises have been kept neat and clean. The total expenditure on establishment, diet, clothing, contingencies, and bazar medicines during the year was Rs. 7,087-6-1 in cash drawn from the treasury, showing a reduction of Rs. 1,332-12-3 as compared with 1883. The receipts of the Manufacture Department were Rs. 754-1-4, the proceeds from the sale of garden produce. The cash receipts paid into the treasury amounted to Rs. 79-5, against Rs. 335 in 1883. Of the garden produce, the greater portion, valued at Rs. 674-12-4, was consumed by the patients. The average cost of each patient for the year is reckoned as Rs. 135-8, showing a decrease of Rs. 10-3-8 on the figures for 1883. The value of the vegetables supplied from the Asylum (Rs. 11-6-1) has been included in this statement. The charges on account of work done for the Asylum by the Public Works Department and by convict labour are shown as Rs. 110-12-6 and Rs. 108-12 respectively. The Superintendent has submitted an interesting report on sugarcane cultivation in the Asylum. The weight of the cane and of the cane juice has not been given, but the outturn of gur is fairly good, and the results show that the work is profitable and well suited to the capacities of the patients. Details of the cane crop cut last January should now be sent to the Director of Agriculture, and this rule should be observed in future years I g Q &#9658;a p b &lt; 6.

( 2 ) In conclusion, the Chief Commissioner commends the management of the Asylum during the past year, and desires to record his thanks to Dr. Campbell for the care and skill which he has bestowed on the institution. By order of the Chief Commissioner of Assam, E. STACK, Offg. Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam.

ANNUAL REPORT ON THE TEZPUR LUNATIC ASYLUM 1885- No. 363C, dated Shillong, the 15th March 1880. FromDr. A. Bteson, Deputy-Surgeon-General, Eastern Frontier District, ToThe Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam. I have the honour to forward the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum Report for 1885, prepared by the Superintendent, Surgeon R. N. Campbell, m.b. 2. It was received in this office on the 25th January, but required to be returned for correction twice, and was finally accepted on the 26th February. My review has been delayed three weeks, owing to my absence on tour. 3. The general features of the report are so exactly similar to those of 1884 that only a brief notice for 1885 is required. 4. The average daily strength of the Asylum inmates is within a fraction of that in 1884, but the sickness has been of a trifling nature comparatively, and the mortality shows a material decrease. There was only one death, and this occurred in a patient who was noted in the Report for 1884 as having been admitted and remaining in very indifferent health. 5. There have been no cases of cholera or other epidemic disease. In this respect the Asylum has enjoyed an immunity common also to the general district population of Darrang during the year. 6. The average cost of each patient shows a further reduction, viz., from Rs. 135-8-1 in 1884 (being Rs. 10-3-8 less than 1883) to Rs. 118-15-9 in 1885. 7. Dr. Campbell's experiments in the cultivation of sugarcane have been continued and extended during the year; and the statistics given show a considerable money profit to the Asylum. There is also a further considerable advantage in the fact that the patients are brought so much into useful and healthy out-door pursuits; and have, what intellect and strength remains, led to pleasurable as well as profitable pursuits. 8. I would again invite attention to the suggestion put forward in my covering letter last year, that the insanes of Sylhet and Cachar might now be accommodated at Tezpur, and thereby save Provincial funds from the serious annual cost of their support at Dacca. The land journey from Thariaghat to Gauhati presents the only difficulty, and, with Police guards at Cherra and Shillong, and a good cart-road all the way, this should not be insuperable. 9. I have twice visited the Asylum during the past year, and have had, as pre&quot; viously, every reason to be satisfied with the unremitting attention, skill, and humanity with which Dr. Campbell has exercised his superintendence and managed the internal economy of the Asylum,

ANNUAL REPORT ON THE TEZPUR LUNATIC ASYLUM FOR THE YEAR 1885. Improvements carried out during the year.More of the wards were improved by having the walls changed from ckra mudded to bamboo and matting. The tank is now ready and very useful for watering the garden and washing purposes. It will be deepened more this cold weather, and be finished off by having a strong bamboo fence erected, a ghat made, &c. More ground has been taken up for cultivation, which has yielded a good crop of sugarcane, besides large quantities of chillies, brinjals, &c. for the use of the insanes. 2. Accommodation.This is the same as last year. There is sufficient to accommodate a much larger population than is ever found in the Asylum. 3. Clothing and bedding.Good and suitable; as in former years, blankets and blanket coats were obtained from Bhagulpur Jail for the cold season, whilst summer clothing and tat bedding were obtained from the Tezpur Jail. 4. Drainage good. The site is high and dry, and water does not lodge. 5. Hospital Accommodation.As described in previous years. 5. Water-supply.The drinking-water is obtained for a great part of the year from two wells inside the compound. Towards the end of the cold weather this runs short and from this time until the rains set in the supply is obtained from the river. It is filtered through charcoal in gharras. For washing purposes, the river and tank are used, and also for watering the garden. 7. Conservancy.As described in previous years. The dry-earth system is in force, and works well. 8. Admission and discharges. Statement No. 1.During the year 16 males and 7 females were admitted and re-admitted; 7 males and 4 females discharged. Table of Comparison of past seven years. 1885. 1884.

Escapes.Soirobi, female, was to be made over to the care of her husband, but on the 25th March she escaped, probably with the husband's connivance, as he also disappeared. No search was instituted, as she was to have beon made over to her friends as improved. Kasi, male, escaped on 9th July, and has not been heard of. Of those admitted and re-admitted, 11 were natives of Assam, 10 were foreigners, and 2 unknown.

REPORT on SUGARCANE CULTIVATION in the TEZPUR LUNATIC ASYLUM. 1. The c:me experimented with is of two kinds, Maugh and Tell, of which the former is support to be the better, as it is said to contain most juice. This 1 have not tested, but when the next crop is ready I will do so. 2. Two plots of land were planted out with cane, one in May 1883, which I shall call A, the old crop; and the other in May 1884, which I shall call B, the new crop. 3. Plot A.This was planted in May 1883. The first crop was reaped in Match 1884. A short report was written along with the annual report of the Asylum for 1884. This plot is 1 bigha 4 kathas 17 lechas and 3 koras in area. The second crop was taken off from 8th to 2b'th January 1885, and occupied the insanes altogether 19 days in cutting, crushing, and converting into goor. Altogether 13,700 canes were cut off this plot, equal to 274 bundles of 50 canes each, from which 220-i- ghuras of juice were extracted, 'ihe ghvra is the ordinary ghura used by the natives for holding water. From those 220^ ghuras of juice 27 ghuras of goor were obtained, each ghuvah containing on an average 16 seers of goor. Besides the goor obtained, 53 bundles of roots, each bundle containing 50 roots, or altogether 2,650 roots, were cut and planted in beds ready to be transplanted into a new plot of land to the north-east of the Asylum when the proper times comes, which is the end of April or beginning of May. 4. Plot B.The area of this plot is exactly 1 bigha. It was reaped and the cane crushed, and goor manufactured from 27th January to 5th February 1885, occupying the insanes for ten days.. This is the first crop off this plot, which was planted in May 1884 from roots obtained from plot A. The outturn was 163 bundles of canes, each bundle containing 50 canes, equal to 8,150 canes, which yielded 144 ghuras of juice, from which 17 ghuras of goor were obtained. Besides this, 65 bundles of roots, 50 roots in a bundle, or 3,250 roots, were planted in beds, and will be transplanted about the end of April or beginning of May into a new plot. This transplanting will take place after good rain has been obtained. The initial cost of A was given in my former notes. The cost during the past year has simply been the insane labour used in cutting and crushing the cane and boiling down the juice, which may be reckoned as nil to the Asylum, as this form of labour cannot be estimated. The cost of plot B has been the roots taken from plot A, which might have been sold at Re. 1 per 300, or 6 bundles per rupee, plus the hoeing and cultivating of the ground, the cutting and crushing of the cane, and the boiling down the juice, all of which was done by insane labour, and cost the Asylum nothing. The only expense incurred was Rs. As.

A great part of this is used in the Asylum, as gur is used instead of sugar, and the roots are used for new land. Altogether, this cultivation is very profitable &quot;to the Asylum. Plot A has just been planted with dhu dhdn, as the sugarcane had two crops off it, and was useless for further cane-growing. The weight of cane and cane-juice was unfortunately not kept, but care will be taken to do so in future. R. N. Campbell, m.b., Surgeon, Superintendent, Tezpur Lunatic Asylum. NOTES on CULTIVATION of AHU DHAN. The plot of land is the same as that mentioned in the report on sugar cultivation, and is there called plot A. Its area is 1 bigha 4 kathas 17 lechas 3 koras. The ground was cleared and hoed in March and the dhdn sown in the beginning of April. The quantity used in sowing was 24 seers,, which cost Re. 1. The labour of preparing the ground, sowing, and reaping was all carried on by insane labour. Reaping was begun in August, and the total production obtained was 10 maunds, which was sold at Re. 1-4 per maund; this realising altogether Rs. 20. The cost was Rs. As.

Resolution on the Report of the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for 1885. Extract fiom the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner of Assam in the General Department, No. 2,238, dated the 16th April 18S6. Read Letter No. 363C, dated the 15th March 1886, from the Deputy-Surgeon-General, Eastern Frontier District, to the Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam, forwarding the Annual Report on the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1885. RESOLUTION. The report was received six weeks after the due date. The delay is explained by the necessity of returning it twice for revision, and by the absence of the Deputy-Surgeon-General on tour, 2. Several material improvements were effected during the year; the tank was deepened, and more ground taken up for gardening. 3. On the 1st January 1885 there were 55 patients in the Asylum, of whom 20 were criminal lunatics; 18 new and 5 old cases were admitted during the year, as compared with 21 admitted in 1884; 11 were discharged, one died, and two escaped. One woman escaped, with the connivance of her husband. At the close of the year the number of patients was 64, of whom 18 were criminal lunatics. The daily average strength remains much the same as last year; 5 patients were re-admitted, and the number discharged fell from 25 to 11. The average number of sick was nearly double that in 1884; but the diseases were slight. There was no cholera; and only one death occurred, as compared with 8 in the previous year. The conservancy arrangements continue to work well. 4. The total expenditure in cash drawn from the treasury and by paper credit amounted to Rs. 6,323-11-10, showing a reduction of Rs. 763-6-3 as compared with 1884. The receipts from the manufacture department show a considerable increase, while the greater part of the produce was utilised in the Asylum. The cash receipts rose from Rs. 79-5 to Rs. 289-1-3, mainly due to extended manufacture and sale of sieves and gur. A satisfactory feature in the report is the reduced average cost of each patient, which fell from Rs. 135-8-1 in 1884 to Rs. 118-15-9 in 1885. 5. The Superintendent's reports on the cultivation of sugarcane and paddy will be communicated to the Director of Agriculture. A second plot of cane and a plot of paddy were put under cultivation, and the estimated profit of these operations increased from Rs. 31-2-0 in 1884 to Rs. 185-6-8 in 1885. 6. The report shows that the state of the institution continues to be satisfactory, and the Chief Commissioner concurs in Dr. Eteson's opinion as to the skill and economy with which Dr. Campbell has administered the Asylum.

No. 445C, dated Camp, Nowgong, Assam, the 1st March 1889. FromC. P. Costello, Esq., Deputy-Surgeon-General, and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam, ToThe Secretary to tho Chief Commissioner of Assam. I have the honour to submit the Annual Report of the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1888, prepared by Surgeon R. IS. Campbell, m.b., Superintendent of the Asylum and Civil Surgeon of Tezpur. I must here explain that this report has been delayed by the following circumstances:When first received in my office, on the 19th January 1889, the Cash Statement was wanting; it had to be returned for correction on the 28th of that month, and was received back corrected on the 6th ultimo, and the Cash Statement (No. 9) was returned from the Comptroller's Office on 12th ultimo. The report, thus completed and corrected, did not reach me until 26th ultimo, during my inspection tour. 2. As directed by the Government of India, the senior Hospital-Assistant at Tezpur attends the Asylum during the temporary absences of the Superintendent in the district, and the warders are no longer armed with batons. 3. I inspected the Asylum on the 2nd ultimo. I give below a copy of my remarks made in the visitor's book: &quot; Inspected this Asylum this morning, accompanied by Dr. Campbell, Civil Surgeon. &quot; There are 85 lunatics under treatment, sub-divided thus: &quot;Criminal male............................................................ 23&quot;) T fl 9P &quot;) &quot;Dittofemale ......................................................... 3 J 10l(U M (Grand total under ' Non criminal male ................................................... 43). -ro ( treatment 85. &laquo; Ditto female ................................................... 10 \ iotal jy ) Grand Total.................. 85 &quot; During the year 1888 there were admitted &quot; Criminal male ..................................................................... 6 7 ,, ~) &quot; Ditto female .................................................................. 2 | M Grand total 35 &quot; Non-criminal male ............................................................... 19 ) 07 ( admitted. &quot; Ditto female............................................................... 8 J z&lt; ) &quot;There is accommodation for 80 males +28 females =108. In the past year the maximum numbers in the Asylum in any one day were males 70 4* females 19 = 89, so that the accommodation was not exceeded. &quot; Only 1 criminal malo and 3 non-criminal (males) lunatics havo been admitted since 1st January 1889. &quot; In 1887 the admissions were &quot; Ncn-criminal male................................................................................... 19 ' Ditto female..................................................................................... 7 Total ................................................ 26 &quot; Criminal male.................,....................................................................... 12 &quot; Ditto female......................................................................................... Total............................................... 12 Grand Total admitted in 1887........................ 38 II Deaths in 18S8.There were 7 deaths: 1 horn meningitis, 2 from debility, 1 from ansemia, and 3 from respiratory diseases. &quot;In 1887.There were 11 deaths, so that the past was a more healthy year than the previous year (1887). &quot; Discharged cured, fyc.In 1888, 3 criminal and 7 non-criminal lunatics were discharged cured, 4 were discharged as improved, and 1 as not improved. &quot;Escapes*I regret to see that 3 lunatics escaped. &quot; Causes of Lunacy.Bhang, intoxicating liquors, charas, and opium, especially bhang, figure as the main (drug) causes of lunacy in all tho cases with, as causes other than poisonous or drug causos, grief, worry, shock, &c, in comparatively minor degrees in the order as given above. &quot; The Asylum is clean, neat, and in good genoral order. The wards are sufficiently ventilated and comfortable, and, apparently well watched by warders sleeping between the different compartments. Tho night and day latrines are in good order. 1 examined tho food, and found it good and ample. The water also is of good quality. The clothing is very good indeed, and tho bodding is sufficient. &quot; There are, it seems to me, a sufficiency of warders, &c, i.e., as long as reasonable care is observed, and as, at least, the present proportion of those watchmen to the lunatic population is observed and insisted on. M I compliment Dr. Campbell on the admirablo state of this Asylum. &quot; N. B. I would like to see the dispensary and medicines in better order.&quot; 4. The accommodation is quite sufficient for the number of lunatics in the Asylum. The creneral sanitary arrangements are satisfactory, and the drinking-water is of good quality. I was satisfied with the diet scale and cooking.
( 2 ) 5. Seventy-three lunatics remained on the last day of 18S7. 32 were admitted in 1888. These admissions were less by 3 than those in 1887, and the re-admissions correspond in number (3) with those in that year. The admissions have been, as a rule, increasing yearly, notwithstanding the slight decrease of the past year. This general increase of admissions is most marked amongst the &quot; imported coolies,&quot; and ia probably due to the increase in this class of labourers in Assam of late years, and to their well-known addiction to intoxicating drugs, &c. Even with a greater average population than in 1887 and previous years, there were only 7 deaths, which is a great improvement over the mortality of 1887. I regretted to have had to remark in the visitors' book on the escape of three lunatics, and I then directed that greater watchfulness and care must be observed to prevent future escapes. Dr. Campbell thought, and I agreed with him, that if the establishment did their duty thoroughly, there would not be any escapes. The discharges from the Asylum were10 cured, 5 made over to friends, 4 as improved and 1 not improved. 83 lunatics remained under treatment at the close of the year. 6. The different preparations of Indian hemp (Cannabis Indica) have been the chief &quot;physical&quot; causes of insanity amongst the inmates of this Asylum in 1888; spirit-drinking coming next in order, followed by opium. The moral causes account for less than one-third of the known causes. 7. Melancholia and acute and chronic mania, in the above order, were the principal forms of insanity, 8. Dr. R. N. Campbell deserves high commendation for the kindness, tact, and care which he has shown in the management of this Asylum. requiring s\ CHARLES P. COSTELLO, Deputy-Surgeon-General and Sanitary Commissioner, Asftam.
ANNUAL REPORT ON THE TEZPUR LUNATIC ASYLUM FOR THE YEAR 1888. 1. Improvements.A new well has been completed, which will supply a plentiful and good supply of pure water. 2. Accommodation.The Asylum can accommodate 80 males and 28 females. There was no overcrowding during tho year, as the greatest number confined on any one night was 70 males and 19 females. 3. Clothing and bedding.This was tho same as in former years. They wore of good quality, and obtained from Bhagulpur Jail. Summer clothing is obtained from Tezpur Jail, and is of gooJ quality. Both are sufficient and suitable. Tho expenditure is always considerable, as insanes are very destructive. 4. Drainage.This has been described boforo. The site is high and dry, and tho drainago good and natural into the adjacent rice land. 5. Hospital accommodation.Ordinary cases are treated in the wards, but serious cases or cases requiring spocial treatment are treated in a separate building, with three double compartments, or in a small bungalow. 6. Water-supply.There is a good tank, which only receives rain-water and cannot bo contaminated, besides the now well abovementione.i. The tank has been used all the present year, as the well requires to be cleaned out before being used. The old wells have beon closed and padlocks put on. All drinking-water is filtered through (/hurras of charcoal and sand. 7. Conservancy.The dry-earth system is in force, and works well. Insanes aro very filthy in their habits, and this is the only form of conservancy which would answer. 8. Admissions and discharges {Statement No.l).During the year 25 males and 10 females were admitted or re-admitted; 13 males and 2 females were discharged. Table of Comparison. 1888. 1887.

On right side a quantity of .serum with flaculent lymph was found. It will be noted how common pleurisy is among insanes. This is due to the exposure they have undergone. 17.

Resolution on the Report of the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for 1888. Extract from the Proceedings oj the Chief Commissioner of Assam in the General Department, No. 2,215, dated Shillong, the 5th April 1889. Read' Letter No. 445C, dated Camp, Nowcrong, the 1st March 1889, from {the Deputy-Surgeon-General, Assam District, to the Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam, forwarding the Annual Report on the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1888. RESOLUTION. This Report was received in the Chief Commissioner's O.'ftee on the 6th March 1889, with a nearer approach to punctuality than in the preceding three years. The due date, however, is 1st February. 2. The report is encumbered with several items of standing information, and with the repetition of figures separately shown in the statements accompanying it. References to such matters as clothing, drainage, and the use of the dry-earth system, which have been reported upon year after year, and in respect of which no alteration has taken place during the year, are uncalled for in an annual report. It is equally unnecessary to repeat in the body of the report information such as that relating to the residence of those admitted, the religion of the insanes, and the alleged causes of insanity, which has already been shown in a better and more intelligible form in the statements. Statistics of this nature for a single year have no value, and their proper place, in the absence of circumstances requiring explanation, is in the statements, and not in the text of the report. Statistics under these heads, embodying the general results of a series of years and the total results from the foundation of the Asylum to date of the report may, however, advantageously be shown in the body of the report for purposes of comparison. It is also observed that in some cases in which explanations appear to be actually required, they have been omitted. For instance, it is said that &quot; the vegetable garden was a comparative failure,&quot; but no explanation of this result is given. 3. The facts and figures in connection with the working of the Asylum during the past year are given in the report and statements, and need not be recapitulated. The most important point, indeed almost the only point, demanding attention is the fact that there were three escapes during the year. The Chief Commissioner would have supposed that the Superintendent would have offered some explanation of these escapes, but such is not the case. The only reference to the point is a passage in the Deputy-Surgeon-General's forwarding letter, in which an opinion is expressed that the escapes were due to a want of watchfulness and care, and that they would probably not have occurred if the establishment had done their duty thoroughly. In this opinion the Chief Commissioner, judging from what he saw on the occasion of his recent inspection, is disposed to concur, and has called for a detailed report of the circumstances from the Deputy-Commissioner, on receipt of which it will be considered whether measures should not be taken to render more stringent the discipline and control at present exercised over the inmates of the Asylum. As regards the observations on the dispensary and medicines recorded in the Deputy-Surgeon-General's inspection note, forwarded with the report, it is not necessary for the Chief Commissioner to take any action, as Dr. Costello will doubtless see that whatever is necessary is done in these respects. 4. With the exceptions noted above, Mr. Fitzpatrick was glad to observe on the occasion of his inspection that the condition of the Asylum appeared to be generally satisfactory, and concurs with the Deputy-Surgeon-General in his remark that Dr. Campbell deserves commendation for his efficient management of the institution. By Order of the Chief Commissioner of Assam, F. C. DAUKES, Offg. Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam. A. B. Preas (General) No. 107195G-4-89.

No. 207C, dated Shillong, the 7th February 1890. FromC. P. Costbllo, Esq., Deputy-Snrgeon- General and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam ToThe Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam. I have the honour'to submit the Annual Report of the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1880, prepared by Surgeon-Major S. Borah, m.b., Superintendent of the Asylum and Civil Surgeon of Tezpur. The report was first received in my office on the 18th January 1890; it had to be returned for correction on the 22nd of that month, and was received back on the 4th current (at Gauluiti by the Deputy-Surgeon-General when on tour, and on the 6th current at Shillong). 2. I inspected the Asylum on the 23rd ultimo. I give below a copy of my inspection remarks as made in the visitors' book: &quot; Inspected this Asylum, accompanied by Surgeon Major S. Borah, Civil Surgeon. &quot;(2) The want, of a walled enclosure to prevent escapes strikes one when entering and inspecting this Asylum. The weak enclosing and, in many places, rotten palisading is not sufficient for this purpose. The palisading between the criminal lunatic sheds and those of the women is so broken and rotten in places that communication between them and entry into the female division presents no difficulties to the former class of lunatics. I am glad that an extra keeper has been sanctioned. I think that there .should be two more keepers, as the present men complain of being overworked. I quite agree with the Commissioner in thinking that there ought to be a police guard for this Asylum, and also that two policemen should accompany each visitor, as, with so many criminal lunatics, the wonder is that the compounder has been the only person killed by these lunatics in the past few years. More of such catastrophies must, in time, occur unless precautions are taken to prevent them. &quot;(3) There have been 3 escapes, 1 criminal, 2 non-criminal = 3, in the past year. The criminal lunatic had escaped twice in 1888, and is still at large. A special report of this escape was submitted to the Chief Commissioner, through the Deputy-Commissioner, by the Superintendent. I am surprised that no more escapes have occurred, as there seems no great difficulty in the present comparatively open state of the enclosure, which offers no sufficient obstacle to a determined man. It will be an advantage in this respect when the proposed criminal lunatic ward has been built. &quot;(3) The annual repairs are not, completed as yet. The Asylum and surroundings are clean and in a sanitary state, excepting the latrines which, owing to the filthy habits of many of the inmates, are not as clean in all cases as is necessary and desirable. All the arrangements for the preservation of the general health of the lunatics are excellent: food, clothing, and ventilation, as well as drinking-water being satisfactory, and there are good bathing arrangements. The small hospital is in good order. The medicines, &c, for immediate use should all be locked up in the almirah to prevent accidents in case of any of the lunatics finding their way into the room, which is at once office and dispensing room. There is no overcrowding, nor has there been during the past year, the Asylum being licensed for 108 lunatics, and the maximum number in any one day in 1889 did not exceed 105. ''(5) The average population in this Asylum is fast increasing, having been 71*29 in 1887, 33*40 in 1888, and 95*42 in 1889; and this should be considered in any re-construction of this Asylum. The average number of criminal lunatics has increased from 20*42 in 1887 to 26*99, or almost 27, in 1889.&quot; CHARLES P. COSTELLO, Deputy Surgeon-General, Administrative Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam.

Escapes.Three male lunatics escaped during the year 1889, viz., one criminal, named Boga Sheik; the other two non-criminals, named Budlm Ghatowal and Ham Das Sonthal. (a) The Criminal Boga SheikWho was sent from Kamriip district, twice escaped in 1888 and once in 1889, and is still at large. A special report about him was sent to the Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam through the Deputv-Coinmissioner of Darrang, vide this office letter No. 81, dated the 15th August 1889. (b) Budhu GhatowalA non-criminal from Sibsagar, was admitted in Asylum on 28th May 1888, for melancholia. His mental condition apparently improved. He escaped, on the night of 18th March 1889, by removing 3 bamboos of the palisading. Chaukidar Buchou Sing, then in charge, was warned, this being his first offence. (c) Ram Das SonthalNon-criminal from Dibrugarh, was admitted in Asylum on the 16th May 1889 for acute mania. His mental condition was so much improved that ho was allowed to work in the vegetable garden, along with others, on the 19th October 1889. While he was working in the garden, he escaped without being noticed by the man, Bolo Ham, in charge, who was fined Rs. 2 for neglect of duty. The notice of these escapes was invariably sent to the Deputy-Commissioner and District Superintendent of Police. Duration of disease of those admitted. Under G months. Over 6 months.

Resolution on the Report of the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for tlie year 1889. Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner of Assam in the General Department, No. 1,9900., dated the 21st March 1890. Read Letter No. 207 G., dated Shillong, the 7th February 1890, from the Deputy-Surgeon-General, Assam District, to the Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam, forwarding the Annual Eeport on the Tezpur Asylum for the year 1889. RESOLUTION. 1. The Chief Commissioner is glad to notice chat, under the orders conveyed in the Resolution on the Report for 1888, the bulk of the present Report has been much curtailed. 2. With a view to reduce the number of escapes, of which there were no less than three during the year, and in order to provide for the maintenance of proper discipline in the Asylum, the construction of two additional solitary cells and of a ward for the confinement of criminal lunatics has been sanctioned. The number of warders has also been increased, and rules for the guidance of the warders have been framed and approved by the Chief Commissioner. With the same objects in view, the Chief Commissioner has, further, had under his consideration proposals for the erection of a masonry wall round the Asylum, and for the provision of a police guard. Of these proposals, the former will be adopted as soon as funds are available, and the latter is still under enquiry. By Order of the Chief Commissioner of Assam, F. C. DAUKES, Offg.

No. 83T., dated Camp Dibrugarh, the 12th February 1891. From Deputy-Suroeon-General 0. P. Costello, Administrative Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam, ToThe Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam. 1 have the honour to submit the Annual Report of the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1890, prepared by Surgeon-Major S. Borah, m.b., Superintendent of* the Asylum and Civil Surgeon, Tezpur. The report was first received in my office on the 17th January 1891 ; it had to be returned for correction, and was received back corrected on the 26th January 1891. As it was sent tome by book post, and I was on inspection duty at Margherita, &c, when it arrived here, I have been only able to take it up this day, and I lose no time in submitting it to the Chief Commissioner. 2. I have not, as yet, inspected the Asylum, although I shall do so within a week or so from this date. 3. The Cash Statement No. 9 is not in my hands here, but I hope it may be sent on from Shillong before submission of this letter with the report to the Chief Commissioner. It had to jo. sent to the Comptroller for verification. 4. As regards paragraph 2, &quot; Accommodation,&quot; in the report under consideration, I submitted the letter No. 75, dated the 13th June 1890, referred to, to the Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam, with ray No. 914C, dated the 18th June 1890, and 1 received memorandum No. 3,312J. of 7th August 1890, in reply, with enclosure No. 1,988, of 21st July 1890, from Chief Engineer, under which I was informed that the two additional solitary cells and the criminal ward for 30 criminal lunatics would be completed soon ; and, in fact, they have since been completed and brought into use. It appears, however, from Dr. Borah's paragraph 2 under reference, that the accommodation is still insufficient. As I shall inspect the Asylum in a few days, I shall then inquire into this matter, and shall let the Chief Commissioner know ray opinion as to whether another increase of accommodation is necessary or not. 5. As regards the nine deaths, Dr. Borah gives the reasons of this unusual mortality in paragraph 16 of the report. I shall, however, inquire into this subject on my approaching visit, with a view to see if those deaths were as unavoidable as they seem to have been from the report under consideration, and shall submit my opinion to the Chief Commissioner. 6. The Superintendent lately asked for an increase of his establishment, and this question shall also form a subject of inquiry at my visit, and subsequent report to the Chief Commissi aer. 0. P. COSTELLO, Deputy-Surgeon-General, Administrative Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam.

Accommodation.The Asylum can accommodate 108 insanes (males 80, females 28 ) ; the greatest number confined in any one night was 119 ( males 87, females 32 ), so that the Asylum was overcrowded. report en the subject was submitted to the Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam, through the Deputy-Surgeon-General, by this office letter No. 75, dated the 13th June 1890, for increased accommodaticn, reply of which has not yet been received. 3.

Ditto ... Kamcharan Male Escapes.Two male lunatics,one criminal Tura Khoria, the other non-criminal, named Bog Ram Keot, escaped during the year, against 3 of previous year. (a) Jura Khoria.The criminal Tura Khoria was sent from Gol&ghat, and admitted in Asylum on 20th December 1885 for melancholia. The lunatic quite recovered the reason, and on the 13th October 1887 was sent to stand his trial. After having been tried at Golagh&t, he was sent back to Asylum, and admitted again in Asylum on the 13th January 1888 unJer provision of Section 471 of Criminal Procedure Code. Since then Tura Khoria continued sane, and was allowed to cook for the insanes. Notwithstanding his appointment as warder of the Asylum was suggested by the Local Government ( vide letter No. 4,268, dated the 22nd November 1889, from the Officiating Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam to the Superintendent, Lunatic Asylum, Tezpur ), on the night of 26th April 1890,
( 4 ) Tura Khoria escaped from the Asylum. A report about him was sent to the Secretary to Ihe Chief Commissioner of Assam by this office letter No. 181, dated the ZlTvZZbn 1800, and steps for his recapture were taken ; but as he was quite sane, no trace has been found. Thechaukidar (Buchon Sing) then in charge was dismissed for neglect of duty. (b') Bog Ham Keot.Bog Ram Keot. a non-criminal from Gauhati, was admitted in Asylum on 20th April 1887 for melancholia. On 14th December 1890, he, along with five other lunatics, was sent to cut ekra on the other side of the Mora Boroli river ; and while he was working in the jungle, he escaped without being noticed by the man Seho Ram in charge, who was fined for neglect of duty. N.B.This lunatic was recaptured at Golaghat, and sent to the Asylum on 10th January 1891. So virtually there is only one escape remaining at large. Duration of disease of those admitted.

Resolution on the Report of the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1890. Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner of Assam in the Judicial Department, No. 2,756V., dated the 14th April 1891. Read Letter No. 83T., dated Camp Dibrugarh, the 12th February 1891, from the Deputy-Surgeon-General, Assam District, to the Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam, forwarding the Annual Report of the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1890. RESOLUTION. Several useful improvements were sanctioned during the year, and the Officiating Chief Commissioner is glad to see from a perusal of the remarks made by the Deputy-Surgeon -General, who inspected the Asylum on the 16th February 1891, that the work has been carried out in a satisfactory manner. As regards accommodation, Dr, Costello recommends in his inspection note the provision of an additional ward of 10 women, the existing wards not being sufficiently large to accommodate the average number of women in the Asylum, which in 1890 was 29*22. Effect will be given to this recommendation. As regards male lunatics, the Deputy-Surgeon-General considers that as the overcrowding is only temporary, there is no occasion at present to provide additional accommodation; but he adds&quot; A good additional criminal ward for 20 criminal lunatics should be added when the funds at command of Government will allow,&quot; As the overcrowding is at present temporary only and may not continue, and as additional accommodation in the shape of a new criminal ward for 30 men has recently been provided, it does not appear necessary at once to incur further expenditure ; but the matter will not be lost sight of, and if experience should show that more accommodation is required as a permanent arrangement, it will be provided. 2. Under the head of mortality, the Deputy-Surgeon-General explains in his inspection note that of the 9 deaths which took place, two occurred soon after the admission into the Asylum of the lunatics concerned who were in a very bad state of health when admitted. But for these two cases, the mortality would have been less than in 1889. 3. The increase of establishment, to which reference is made in paragraph 6 of the letter from the Deputy-Surgeon-General, forwarding the report, has since been sanctioned. 4. In accordance with the orders circulated with Home Department No. 9-503M., dated the 25th July 1890, a statement is annexed to the present report, showing the cost per head of lunatics under the several items of expenditure. With a view to check extravagance, it would be useful to compare the results shown in this statement with those in other Asylums where the conditions are similar, and the Officiating Chief Commissioner would feel obliged if the Deputy-Surgeon-General would be good enough to do this in connection with the expenditure figures shown in the present report and also in the case of future reports. 5. The Officiating Chief Commissioner is glad to notice from the inspection note of the Deputy-Surgeon-General that the sanitary arrangements of the Asylum are satisfactory, and that the Asylum is in excellent order and shows signs of skilful and careful management, for which credit is due to Surgeon-Major Borah, the Superintendent. By Order of the Chief Commissioner of Assam, F. C. DAUKES, Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam. A. 6.1'rtBB (Judicial) No. 1301:50+110-15 -1-91.

No. 1175C, dated Shillong, the 25th February 1892. FromSurgeon-Colonel Charles P. Costello, Administrative Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner of Assam, ToThe Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam. I beg to submit the Annual Report and returns of the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1891, together with a copy of my inspection minute on this Asylum written on yesterday. As this minute reviews all the points requiring action, there is no occasion to add any further remarks here, except to say that the submission of the returns, and consequently of the report, have been delayed chiefly by a non-agreement between Cash Statement No. 9 as prepared by the Superintendent (which corresponds with the figures of the local treasury officer) and as shown in the accounts of the Comptroller's office. 2. The report has also been slightly delayed by my proposal to inspect the Asylum previous to submitting it, which met with your approval. 3. In accordance with paragraph 4 of the Chief Commissioner's Resolution on the Report of the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for 1890, I append herewith a statement showing the cost per head of lunatics under the several items of expenditure as compared with those of the Lunatic Asylums at Dacca, Patna, and Cuttack. It will appear from this statement that the increased cost of establishment of the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum during the year 1891 was caused by the addition of three temporary warders to the establishment, at one warder to every 10 lunatics, in correspondence with the system in vogue in Lunatic Asylum of the North-West Provinces. (See telegram No. 4J., dated the 2nd January 5 891, from Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam to the Superintendent, Lunatic Asylum, Tezpur.) The slight increase in the cost of diet, clothing and bedding, as well as medicines, is due to most of the e articles having been procured from Bengal and to the carriage expenses to Assam having been added on to the original cost there ; but it is satisfactory to note that the total cost per head of lunatics at the Tezpur Asylum is less than that at the Cuttack and Dacca Asylums, in which districts living is generally cheaper.

Inspection Minute on the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum by Surgeon-Colonel C. P. Costello, Administrative Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam, dated the 22nd February 1892. Inspected this Asylum this morning accompanied by Surgeon-Major S. Borah, the Superintendent and Medical Officer. 1. The general cleanliness and order are excellent. The proportion of warders to the lunatics is satisfactory, and the establishment is well reported on. The drainage is good, conservancy satisfactory. There is only one well in use for drinking water, which has been lately cleaned. 1 have directed Dr. Borah to procure for me an analysis of a sample of this water, which was sent to the Chemical Examiner, Calcutta, last D&lt; cember. A rough analysis of this water shows it to be of good quality. It is now filtered in the old fashioned way through gharrahs, &c. As this Asylum is growing in size and importance, I recommend that the well-water be filtered in regular filtering beds with a distribution tank attached, as is so satisfactorily done in the jail here. 1 am glad to hear that the tank on the western side of the Asylum is not now used even for bathing ; as, when it was so nominally used hist year, it was reasonably blamed for the outbreak of cholera which then occurred here. 2. The western (bamboo) gate is weak, and should be remade with strong bamboo. The eastern gate is pretty to look at, but is not strong enough : a high and stronger gate is required here. I hope the Government will soon be able to .^ee their way to building a high masonry enclosure all round, as the present bamboo enclosure is unsafe and insufficient to prevent escapes. The iron gratings at the two western drainage culverts require strengthening. The criminal lunatic ward should have been pucca throughout as, in consequence of its being katcha pucca from the plinth upwards, a criminal lunatic was able to make a hole in the wall and thus escape lasi year ; and the present system of one long wooden plank frame for sleeping on helped him, as it concealed his digging operations which were made underneath itbetween it and the floor. Separate wooden beds for each lunatic would be more safe, and ought to be substituted for this general wooden bed frame. 3. ' C' ward for noncriminal lunatics is old, and requires repair. In the female section there is also an old ward, which is tottering, and should be either thoroughly repaired or a new one erected. All the wards to be repaired or rebuilt should have little verandahs, as these would admit of the lunatics sitting beneath them in the rains, and would also protect the wards from the entry of rain when driven by gusts of wind. The old female ward, now being rebuilt, should be completed at once. There seems some unexplained delay about this. 4. 1 have carefully gone into the clothing and bedding, as any deficiency in them would, especially in the winter, cause chills with consequent chest and bowel diseases as well as recurrences of ague. I find the bedding to be generally deficient, especially as regards the taut mattresses, which are altogether absent or too short, and the blankets, as many of the lunatics are only provided with one each ; and where there is a second blanket, it is generally quite useless from age. Of course, the lunatics are very destructive of all articles of clothing and bedding, but yet the Superintendent must see to this important matter at once. Clothing sufficient. The raw and cooked food are very satisfactory. There is no overcrowding now, nor has there been any in the past year, as in an extra ward, the accommodation of which is not reckoned in the capacity by the Department Public Works, there is spare room for 15 extra lunatics, which is utilized whenever there is any tendency to overpopulation in this Asylum.
5. The sickness and mortality here last year were unusually high, the former exceeding any year since and including 1881, and the latter nny year excepting 1883 and 1887. Cholera accounted for some of the sickness and mortality, and chest affections with dysentery accounted for the majority of the remainder, I think that the complete disuse of the tank-water will go fur to prevent a recurrence of cholera, and that careful attention to my directions as regards sufficient bedding, &c, for the patients ought to result in fewer diseases having their origin, &c , in chills. 6. 1 find a total of 117 lunatics in jail to-day, i.e. Criminal malo ... ... ... ... ... 27 .&laquo; ICIUcltO &raquo; &#9632; mi Noncriminal male ... ... ... ... 58 &raquo; female ... ... ... ... 30 Total 117 or males 85 and females 32, total 117.

ANNUAL REPORT ON THE TEZPUR LUNATIC ASYLUM FOR THE YEAR 1891. 1. Improvement.An extra female ward for accommodation of 10 female lunatics has been built. The cook shed has been extended to its double length. 2. Accommodation.The Asylum can accommodate 118 insanes (males 80, females 38). The greatest number confined on any one night, was 127 (males 98, females 29), so that the overcrowding in Asylum was avoided by utilizing one of the old criminal wards, which is kept thoroughly repaired for the emergency, as suggested by the Deputy Surgeon General in his inspection remarks, dated the 16th February 1891. 3. Clothing and bedding.No change. 4. Drainage. Ditto. 5. Hospital accommodation. Same as in last year, but a better building is desirable. 6. Water-supply.No change. 7.

Of the re-admissions, one Bhog Ram, a noncriminal male, escaped, and was recaptured after 27 days, and one Boga Sheikh, a criminal male, who escaped dining 1889, and was recaptured during 1891. The other five re-admitted had been discharged previously. Escapes.Two nonoriminal male lunatics, named Lochmon Ghatowar and Talia Rajbangsi, escapeil during the year. The latter was captured on loth January 1892, so only one remains at largo. (a) Lochiron Ghatowar was sent from Xowgong, and admitted in Asylum on GtK May 1890 for melancholia His mental condition apparently improved, but. was in hospital since 19th June 1891 on account of ill-health. He, on the morning of 8th duly 189 i, escaped from the hospital. (It) Talia Uajbangsi, from Nowgong, was admitted in Asylum on 10th September 1890 l'or acute mania. He escaped on the night of 10th November 1891 by breaking the brick wall ol&quot; the criminal ward. ! he chaukitlar Chena Ham and the keepers Ham N a ray an Sing and 1'ooa Ram then in duty, and who were entirely to blame, were fined and dismissed for neglect of duty. The notice of these escapes was sent to the Distriot Superintendent of Police ; but as the former had improved, no trace has been found ; the latter Talia Ram Kajbangsi has bo&gt; n recaptured on tho 13th January i6iJ2 and so there is only one escape remaining at large.

There were eighteen deaths. The causes of high mortality may bo summed up as follows : (a) State of health on admission. (l&gt;) The bad state of health of most of the lunatics at the commencement of the year. (c) An epidemic of cholera in September last. The report on the outbreak of cholera was submitted to the Deputy Surgeon General first by telegram and subsequently by post, giving a full account of the steps taken, that is, removing the inmates to a camp built, for the purpose 3 miles away from the station. Every precaution as to segregation^ fumigation, and other sanitary arrangements, referred to in Deputy Su'-geon General's Circular No. 78. of 19th July 1890, as well as in Appendix 51 of India Army Regulations, was taken and strictly attended to. Since the outbreak of cholera on the 15th to the 28th September 1891 there were altogether 13 cases, of which 5 proved fatal. In conclusion, I beg to state that no pain was spared to put a stop to this outbreak, and so far, I am glad to say, proved successful. The deaths were: (1) Berl-berl and dropsy (anchylostomlasis). Pema coolie, noncriminal male, from Lakhimpur. Was suffering from general debility and dropsical swelling off and on since his admission.

Post-mortem showed chronic dysenteric lesions and serous effusion in the pleural cavities. (18) Heart disease, dysentery (fatty degeneration).Mussammat Khemi, coolie, noncriminal female, from Darning. Was admitted to Asylum in September 1890. Her health was indifferent, and was ailing off and on. Was in hospital on 24th October for dysentery and other complications. She died on 2nd November 1891. Autopsy revealed fatty degeneration of the heart, old adhesions extending between lungs and chest parieties, and mucous membrane of the huge* intestine congested. Judging from the jail returns as well as the district sick and death reports, the year was unusually unhealthy, and this, 1 may presume, told unfavourably on the general health of the lunatics. The most notable fact is the almost constant existence of chronic pleurisy in insane post-mortems. This is due to the exposure which they necessarily undergo before admission to the Asylum. From the above it wi 1 be seen that out of the 18 deaths, 5 were cholera and 8 cases (1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, and 18) were hopeless from the beginning. Hence if these eases were excluded, the actual death rate will be 5, far below that of the last year. The clothing was quite sufficient, and the food good and ample in quantities. 1 have been careful in seeing to this, and do not consider that the mortality in any way was raised by defects in either. 17.

Resolution on the Report of th*. Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1891, Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner of Assam in the Judicial Branch, No. 1826J., dated the 23rd April 1892. Read Letter No. 1175C, dated Shillong, the 25th February 1892, from the Administrative Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam, to the Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam, forwarding the Annual Report of the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1891. RESOLUTION. The average population of the Asylum during the year under report was nearly 120 lunatics, against 110 during the previous year, and the year closed with a population of 111 lunatics in the Asylum, against 118 at the close of 1890. The increase in the population of the Asylum of late years is noticeable, the figures for daily average strength hav ing been: In 1887 &gt;&gt; 1888 &gt;&gt; 1889 1890 1891 71*29 83-40 95-42 110-65 ... 119-65 The total expenditure on the Asylum during the year under report was Rs. 9,536-14-4, or Rs. 79-11-3 per head of average strength. The Chief Commissioner regrets to notice that the number of deaths increased from 9 in the previous year to 18 during the year under report. It is known, however, to the Chief Commissioner that the sickness and mortality were fully enquired into by the Administrative Medical Officer during his recent inspection of the Asylum, and that Dr. Costello has given directions and made recommendations which, when carried out, will place matters on a more satisfactory footing. 2. When visiting the Asylum last month, the Chief Commissioner fully considered the various alterations and additions to the building which have been recommended. Of these, the proposal to build a masonry wall round the enclosure in lieu of the existing palisade is out of the question, the cost being prohibitive. Moreover, the few escapes do not justify the expenditure. In 1889 three lunatics escaped, of whom only one was a criminal, and he was recaptured. Two escapes occurred in each of the years 1890 and 1891 ; but of the lunatics who thus escaped only one was a criminal, and of the five non-criminals who have escaped during the last three years, two have been recaptured. The proposal to erect three new male wards and two female wards for non-criminal lunatics has been sanctioned, and the work will be gradually carried out. Another proposal, namely, that the water supplied to the lunatics should be filtered in regular filtering beds, with a distribution tank attached, Mr. Ward thinks may stand over for the present. The well from which the present water-supply is obtained is a good one, and although the water would doubtless be improved by being filtered, as proposed, it seems scarcely necessary, in view of other more important requirements of the Asylum, to spend money on elaborate filtering arrangements, there being no reason to suppose that the water-supply had anything to do with the heavy mortality in the past year. Considerable expenditure has been incurred recently in providing pucca wards for the criminal lunatics. More accommodation will be needed hereafter if the population of the Asylum goes on increasing as it has done of late. There is, however, a kutcha ward for criminal lunatics, now empty, which, it is hoped, will suffice to accommodate the overflow from the pucca ward for some time to come. By order of the Chief Commissioner of Assam, F. C. DAUKES, Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam. &#9650;. B, Trm (Judicial) No. I-U5-4-S-W. &copy; o 'A 2 &#9632;a OS 4

No. 163T. From SURGEON-COLONEL C. P. COSTELLQ, p.r.c.s.w., Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam, To THE SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER OF ASSAM. Camp Tezpur} the 5th February 1893. Sib, I beg to submit the Annual Report and Returns of the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1802, together with a copy of my inspection remarks on this Asylum written on 2nd February 1893. As these remarks review all the points requiring action, there is no occasion to add any further remarks here. 2. In accordance with Government of India Home Department letter No. 329, dated the 6th June 1892, the construction of two new worksheds (one for males and the other for females) has been sanctioned with the object of providing suitable and sufficient employment under shelter to the inmates of the Asylum, as referred to in my inspection remarks. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, C. P. COSTELLO, Swyeon.Colonel, Principal Medical Officer, and Sanitary Commisxioner, Assam.
INSPECTION REMARKS on the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum by Surgeon-Colonel C. P. Costello, Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam, dated the 2nd February 1893. Inspected this Asylum to-day accompanied by Surgeon-Major Borah, Civil Surgeon and Superintendent. Excepting the ward for criminal lunatics, the Asylum is generally clean, orderly, and free from smell, but the asphalt floor of that ward is not alone wet, but is covered with small pools of urinous smelling fluid. Dr. Borah tells me that he ordered this floor to be washed out daily with a solution of phenyle in order to remove the smell of the urine consequent on the extreme degree of lunacy, &c, of the inmates of this ward, and its being impossible in all cases to arrange for their resorting to the latrine attached. There is no doubt that Dr. Borah's orders have not been carried out. This floor should not alone be washed out with a solution of phenyle, but it should be afterwards swabbed quite dry, which could be easily done, especially as at this time of day (from 9 to 11 a.m.) the criminal lunatics are all in the central Asylum enclosure. The burial of the nightsoil is not carried out correctly according to the regulations, which I have pointed out and explained to Dr. Borah. 1 am sorry to have to record here that the Superintendent showed a remarkable ignorance as to the position or situation of the night-soil-burying ground : and so much so as to leave the decided impression on my mind that he had not selected, nor ever before been to or inspected, the present plot of ground which is used for this purpose, and has been so for over four months. He was also unaware of the number of Asylum bullocks and cows (16) occupying the bullock sheds at night, and as to whether they were the property of Government or of the warders, and I found this shed in a most filthy state, which must be immediately remedied. The columns in the general register of lunatics are not all filled or written up to date, and the registers showing the employment of the lunatics, the extras given to them, the miscellaneous expenditure, the diet roll, as well as the register in which is recorded the attendance of officials, and the cash book have not, except on a comparatively few occasions, been initialed by him as controlling and superintending officer from October 1S92 to date, as was regularly done for each day by his predecessor, Surgeon-Major K. N. Campbell ; and, even where his signature or initial has in previous months been written, one signature or initial has been made to answer for groups of days instead of being initialed daily, as was done by Dr. Campbell. Dr. Borah has to be frequently in the district, inspecting gardens, vaccination, dispensaries, &c, but yet his predecessor had precisely the same duties, and, notwithstanding, contrived while in Tezpur to show by his initials in each register that he had carefully checked the accounts, reuisters, &c. After all, taking the whole year round, the Civil Sargeon here is not absent for much more than a quarter of each month, or perhaps a little more, from the sadr, and therefore there can be no excuse for the omissions above noted. Dr. Borah must not rely too much, as I see he does, on his subordinates, as he is primarily and solely responsible to Government for the careful and successful management of this Asylum. The general appearance of the Asylum and of the lunatics is, however, and in other respects, creditable to Dr. Borah ; yet too much care, especially where money and accounts ate concerned, cannot be taken in strict supervision in an institution of this kind ; so I hope that in future Dr. Borah will show, by his initials opposite each entry, and by their satisfactory state, that he has exercised such strict supervisicn over the registers, &c, and that he will also visit this Asylum at unexpected times, day and night, taking the roll-call of officials and lunatics on each occasion to see if all are present. The two iron grating outlets of the main side drains of the Asylum have not been repaired as yet, as was recommended by me last year. The Superintendent should take measures to have this done at once. 1 do not clearly know who is to blame for the delay, but no more delay should occur in this matter. There is not any overcrowding, and the Asylum is, at present, large enough for all demands on it. The total population to-day is 105, with a total accommodation for 118 ; 24 are criminal lunatics and 81 non-criminal. There are 31 women and 74 men in the Asylum. 48 are ex-garden coolies, 11 having been free immigrants and 37 Act-1 coolies. 57 lunatics arc natives of Assam. To-day there are live cases in hospital suffering from diarrhoea (2), dysentery (1), asthma (1), and amemia (1). The ordinary wards are in good order. The new wards for women and for men are very comfortable, and the verandahs attached should be most useful and healthy in the rains and hot weather. Some of the old male huts still remaining will also be soon replaced by new huts on the above plan. The Chief Commissioner has selected a place,
pointed out to me by Dr. Borah, for the male workshed, and I have selected a site for the female workshed to be erected soon, under Government of India (Home Department) letter No. 329, dated the Gth June 1892, to the Chief Commissioner ; and when these are ready, the men will be employed in oil-pressing, basket-making, and dhan-poundmg, and the women in weaving, dha?i-po\mding and basket-making. At present the lunatics are employed in the vegetable garden and on annual repairs, &c, only. The worksheds will be of use in affording employment to the lunatics in the rains under circumstances where rain, damp, &c, will not affect them much. The clothing and bedding are sufficient. The lunatics are well nourished and evidently well fed. I examined the kitchen, and found it in order, the cooking and dietary being satisfactory. The well outside the Asylum is now being used. It contains good drinking water according to the Chemical Examiner's report of 25th October 1892, and is sufficient for all purposes. It and the well inside the Asylum were cleaned in September last. The latter well (inside the Asylum) contains according to the Chemical Examiner's report of the same date as that for the outside well, most impure water, and should not be used on any account for drinking purposes, as it contains chlorine, free ammonia, and more especially nitrogen as nitrates and nitrites in great excess, which denote considerable animal contamination and a most impure water. I recommend that this well be permanently closed. The tank outside the Asylum is used for the garden only. The lunatics bathe in the Morabharali river, which is pretty close to the Asylum ; Dr. Borah must take care that they do so under a proper warder escort. The warder staff here is now sufficient. The following table gives, for the past three years, all the remaining important and interesting points connected with the working, cost, health, and statistics of this Asylum. The preventive measures taken on my recommendations of last year have resulted in a decided improvement in health and a lessening of mortality as compared with the previous year, Items. 1890. 1891. 1892.

I strongly recommend that the warrant medical officer, as Deputy Superintendent and Assistant Medical Officer of this As)lum, mentioned in Government of India, Home Department letter to the Chief Commissioner, No. 280, dated the 21st May 1892, and advised in my office letter No. 2103C, dated the 27th June 1892, may be appointed as soon as possible, so as to carry on the work with more satisfactory result than is done at present during the frequent absences on duty in the district of the Superintendent, and I think that the remarks which I have had to make above as a result of my present inspection will show how necessary such an officer is for this Asylum. The non-appointment of such an officer up to this, does not, however, in any way excuse the want of strict supervision and the trusting too much to subordinates on the part of the Superintendent, which has been above noted. The Superintendent should be acquainted with ever)7 important detail of the Asylum, and should not be dependent on inferior officials for his mastery and knowledge of the same. He should also be strong enough to have his orders obeyed.

In April 1892 cholera was prevalent among the civil population of the town of Tezpur. During that period one suspected case occurred in the Asylum, which was segregated and treated (result cured). The necessary precautions were strictly carried out, and thus avoided the recurrence of another outbreak of cholera in the Asylum, vide my telegram to Principal Medical Officer, dated the 22nd April 1892. Although the average rate of sickness was higher than the last year, owing to the unhealthinesa of the season, the death-rate, on the contrary, is very low, i.e., 4*44 against 16-04.

i &laquo;o Resolution on the Report of the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1892. Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner of Assam in the Judicial Branch, No. 3704^., dated the 17th April 1893. Read-Letter No. 163T., dated the 5th February 1893, from the Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam, to the Secretary to th.2 Chief Commissioner of Assam, forwarding the Annual Report of the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1892. to cT n 00 CO o RESOLUTION. The average population of the Asylum during the year under report shows a slight decrease, as compared with the previous year (from 1 19 to 112 lunatics of all classes), while the number of lunatics admitted during each of the two years was the same (42). Three lunatics escaped, against two in the preceding year, all of whom were non-criminals. The total eKpsa liture on the Asylum during the year under report was Rs. 10,016-8-11, or Rs. 83-13-10 per head of average strength, against Rs. 9,536-14-4, or Rs. 79-11-3 per head of average strength during 1891. The increase was due mainly to the purchase of additional clothing. The Chief Commissioner is glad to notice a substantial reduction in the number of deaths from 18 in the previous year to 5 during the year under report, and also in the number of admissions to hospital from 70, or 58 per cent, of average strength to 49, or 43*51 per cent, of average strength. The appointment of a Warrant Medical Officer as Deputy Superintendent and resident Medical Officer of the Asylum, to which reference is made in the inspection remarks recorded by the Principal Medical Officer, has been recommended to the Government of India in the event of sanction being accorded to certain proposals made by the Chief Commissioner in connection with the inspection of tea gardens, one result of which would be that garden inspection work would involve the frequent and prolonged absence of Civil Surge 3ns from the headquarters of tea districts. 3. The Chief Commissioner visited the Asylum in January last, and was generally satisfied with the results of his inspection. It is clear, however, from the inspection remarks of the Principal Medical Officer recorded in February last that the Civil Surgeon, who is Superintendent of the Asylum, does not give that personal attention to details in connection with the management of the Asylum which is expected of him. Effect is being given to the suggestions of the Government of India as regards supplying sheltered indoor work for the lunatics, and the new wards for non-criminals are a great improvement. In view of the considerable number of tea garden coolies who are treated in the Asylum, the question whether a contribution might not fairly be made by the Inland Labour Transport Fund towards the cost of the Asylum is being separately considered. In the case of such coolies still under contract, who are cured and sent back to the gardens, the managers of the gardens concerned should be called upon to pay the diet expenses actually incurred. On the other hand, no such payment can be claimed in regard to coolies whose contracts have expired, or have been cancelled, prior to their admission to the Asylum. There is reason to believe that the provisions of the law, requiring the relatives of non-criminal lunatics under certain circumstances to contribute towards the cost of maintenance in the Asylum, are disregarded by district officers, and the Chief Commissioner has drawn the attention of the Asylum Committee to this matter, in order that cases of such neglect may be - I : 1 1 3 t&raquo; d & *i -&laquo;.' u p 1 8 1 ight notice of the Commissioner.

Dated Camp Manipur, the 1st February 1894. Sir, I iiave the honour to submit the Annual Report and Returns of the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1893, in the revised form, in accordance with Government of India Home Department Resolution No. 8Medl.398, dated the 13th July 1893, together with a copy of my inspection remarks on the Asylum written on the 1st December 1893. These remarks comprise all the points which require action, and were separately referred for the Chief Commissioner's consideration in my letter No. 78C, dated the 16th January 1894, and I have nothing further to add now. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, W. P. WARBURTON, m.d., Surgeon-Colonel, 0\f(j. Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam.
m INSPECTION REMARKS on the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum by Surgeon-Colonel W. P. Wakburton, Offg. Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner) Assam, daUd the 1st December 1803. Inspected this Asylum to-day, accompanied by Surgeon-Major-General Rice, Surgeon General with the Government of India, and the Superintendent, Surgeon-Major Macnamara. There are 99 inmates, of whom 71 arc males and 29 females, while there is accommodation for 118. There are 19 male and 3 female criminal lunatics, and. there are Ex-garden coolies Other foreigners Assamese 27 20 52 There were two in hospital, one a case of prolapsus ani, and the other of dropsy. The inmates were all well and warmly clothed, and, with few exceptions, presented the appearance of being well fed, while the food, which had just been cooked for issue, was of excellent quality and well cooked. The mortality during the year has been 15, as compared with 5 in 1892, the causes bavin it been Dysentery Diarrhaaa Lung affections Epilepsy Kidney affection Oancrum oris Anaemia Suicide o O 3 1 1 2 a l Total 15 I find, however, that these figures do not represent the real mortality, for in 1892 19 patients were sent to the charitable dispensary, of whom 17 died, while during the present year 11 were sent there, of whom 10 died, none of these deaths having been recorded in the Asylum returns ; and this, I understand, has always been the custom thus rendering the mortality statistics unreliable and valueless. Such cases will be accounted for in the return of the present year, and in future the practice of sending patients to the dispensary discontinued. The wards, hospital, recreation shed, latrines, and compound are all scrupulously clean and in good order. The plan of doing without utensils and covering the floors of the day and night-latrines with dry earth and changing it each morning is excellent and worthy of imitation in other institutions. The dry earth might also with advantage be spread over the floors of the sleeping wards, which, though clean, are more or less damp b
owing to the uncleanly habits of the lunatics, necessitating the use of water for cleansing purposes. Lunatics are very susceptible to bowel and lung complaints ; 40 per cent, of the recorded deaths this year have been thus caused, and this damp condition, the only defect I could discover, would in cold weather not only produce these diseases, but aggravate all cases of illness exposed to its influence, while in the warm and rainy months the liability to malarial diseases would be increased. Three inches of dry earth, finely powdered, placed over the floors and removed each morning where required, would altogether obviate the necessity for the use of water in the sleeping wards. The floors in the recently-erected wards are on a level with the outside ground, whereas they should be a foot higher ; while the ground outside should be gently sloped for about 10 feet, and a drain dug at the edge of this slope, and connected with the general drainage of the place. This would receive surface water and prevent the introduction of moisture from without. The ventilation of the criminal ward would be improved by increasing the ventilating openings in the &quot; chhat&quot; The entrance to the female ward and compound is an open doorway without a door. A door should be placed there, and kept closed and locked. The lunatics are employed in the garden and on work connected with cleansing^ repairs, &c, but as yet no manufactures have been introduced. The garden was in a good state of cultivation, with promise of a plentiful supply of vegetables. The night-soil is buried in trenches in a plot of ground on the east side of the Asylum. I found the trenching efficiently performed, and the place free from smell. The ground should be dug up, and cropped in from three to six months after trenching. The drinking-water is good and sufficient, and obtained from a well 46 feet deep outside the Asylum entrance. It is liable to contamination from articles thrown into it, and should therefore be completely covered and provided with an iron purnp. The patients are classified into criminal and non-criminal, but it would be preferable, for administrative purposes, to classify them into dangerous and harmless. By so doing, it would be possible to introduce trades into the Asylum, and thus provide occupation for patients who now do nothing. There are 8 male and 2 female warders, the majority of whom have only been employed for a few months, and Dr. Macnamara informs me that the class of men obtainable for the present pay and prospects is very inferior and unreliable. Something should be done to induce a better class of men to enter the Asylum service. A resident hospital assistant is much needed, and would do away with the necessity of sending serious cases to the dispensary. He would carry out all sanitary arrangements, as well as the treatment of the patients, under the orders of the Superintendent, and he would each day inspect all the inmates, and remove to hospital the cases requiring immediate treatment. These frequent inspections are very necessary, for it is a well-known fact that diseases in lunatics are very apt to escape notice in their earlier and slighter stages, only to be discovered when they become serious, and perhaps beyond remedy All books and registers are properly kept, initialled, and up to date. The condition and management of the Asylum reflect the greatest credit on Surgeon-Major Macnamara, who expresses himself well satisfied with the overseer and jemadar, but the compounder has given trouble.

ANNUAL REPORT ON THE TEZPUR LUNATIO ASYLUM FOR THE TE9lE 1893. 1. Asylum, Charge.Surgeon-Major Borah was in charge of the Asylum as Superintendent from the beginning of the year to 23rd May, when 1 took over charge from lim. From 23rd May to the close of the year I was in charge without interruption. 2 Improvements.During the past three years the following improvements have been recommended : (a) A pucca wall round the enclosure,The cost was considered prohibitive, and not warranted by the number of escapes. (b) The erection of three new male wards and two female wards.This improvement has been carried out partly in 1892. The work was completed in the year under review. (c) Improvement of the well outside the enclosure.Either by the erection of a filter, as recommended in 18'dl, or the use of an iron pump as recommended by the Principal Medical Officer at the close of 1893, as the inmates break vessels in the well, which is open, and as the cleaning out of it is expensive and troublesome. I think the latter suggestion preferable as a choice, because the supply has been well reported on during the year by the Chemical Examiner to Government, and is not likely to be improved by filtration. (d) More ventilation in new criminal ward.Again urged as essential by the Principal Medical Officer, Assam, at the close of 1893. Nothing has so far been done, because it was considered unwise to increase apertures which might facilitate escapes in the case of criminal lunatics. (e) The introduction of moveable beds in the criminal ward.Nothing has been done in this direction, although sanction has been given for the change. Doubt has been expressed as to the wisdom of the alteration. This ward has to be washed out every day with phenyle, and, as considerable difficulty is experienced in drying the floor, which is dead level, I would make a more easily carried out recommendation, viz., to lay down a floor raised in the centre with scuttle-holes at the sides, so that the ward could be washed down every morning like a ship's deck. (f) Renewal of the entrance gate.Nothing has been done in view of more urgent requirements. The present gate seems to me to answer all purposes, and the less like a jail we have an institution like this the better. (g) More accommodation for male criminal lunatics.As the present criminal lunatic ward has accommodation for 30 men and as we never at any time during the year had more than 23 male criminal lunatics, I think this addition might well be dispensed with, more especially as female criminal lunatics are not separated at night from the non-criminal female inmates. (h) The introduction of a layer of dry eat th over the floor of the sleeping wards, and so obviating the use of water for cleansing purposes.This suggestion was made by the Sanitary Commissioner, and has already been partially adopted with satisfactory results. (i) The cropping of the trenching ground, the removal of the sharp points on top of the bamboo palisade around the enclosure, alterations affecting the drainage of the criminal ward, the promotion of a keeper to a higher grade, with a view to induce the present staff to take more interest in their work, and the appointment of a special hospital assistant are recommendations lately made by the Principal Medical Officer, and approved of by the Surgeon General with the Government of India, on the occasion of his recent inspection. (j) The two iron gratings guarding the outlets of the Asylum drainage system have been repaired, as directed by Dr. Costello, who visited the Asylum on the 2nd February 1893. The closure of the well inside the enclosure referred to in his inspection note of that date has been carried out. (k) We have taken up more land for cultivation, improved the pathways inside the enclosure, and, by cultivating waste places, have endeavonred to make the place as neat looking as possible. 3. Accommodation.The Asylum contains accommodation for 80 male and 38 female lunatics. The greatest numbers confined in any one day were 79 males and 3i females. There was no overcrowding in any part of the Asylum.
4. Clothing and beddings.There has been no change under this head. The Tezpm Jail made clothing is in use in the hot season, and blanket coats obtained from the Bhagulpur Jail are in use in the cold weather. Tat bedding (with two blankets) is supplied for night use. In many cases a third blanket is required at night. !). Drainage.No change. The present drains, which are open, leave nothing to be desired. 6. Hospital accommodation.No change. 7. Water supply.The well outside the enclosure is the only one now in use. The supply has been favourably reported on by the Chemical Examiner to Government. The water is drawn by a rope and bucket, an arrangement very unsatisfactory in an Asylum, The inmates bathe in a river close to the Asylum. 8. Conservancy.The dry-earth system (with immediate removal to trenches outside the enclosure) is adopted. It leaves nothing to be desired. 9. Adntissibns and Lischarges.The following statement gives particulars of the admissions and discharges for the past two years, and the averages of the preceding ten years: Thef Cured, total Cured per cei Cured per cei Made over tc Improve Not imp Died,total Died, per cei tion.

There were three re-admissions during the year under review. Of these, one was a non-criminal lunatic who escaped in 1892, and returned of his own accord. After escaping on 20th April 1892 he went to the Kowpati tea garden, where he worked as a coolie, and returned to the Asylum on 4th May 1893, bringing the Asylum clothes and a portion oi his earnings with him. The other re-admissions were persons previously discharged. 10. Escapes.Two non-criminal female lunatics escaped during the year. They are still at large. One escaped through the palisading in the day time, and the other escaped at night by opening a padlock with a piece of bamboo. The female keeper in charge was dismissed for neglect of duty. Although notice was given to the Police,, no trace of the escaped lunatics has been found.

However, owing to the unhealthy state of most of the lunatics at the close of 1892, the bad health of the new admissions and a death from an accidental cause, the mortality of the Asylum during the year has been absolutely high, but relatively there is not much difference between it and other years, as it has been the custom to send moribund patients from the Asylum to the dispensary in former years, and their deaths were not shown in the Asylum returns. In 18D2, 10 patients were sent to the charitable dispensary, of whom 17 died, while during 1893, 11 were sent and 10 died. The practice of sending moribund lunatics to the dispensary I discontinued for two reasons : First.Because I do not think it fair as regards the returns of either institution. Second.Because the dispensary has been full to overflowing, and 1 think the sick can be astwell looked after at the Asylum.
d 4 of i 13th An application for the entertainment of a special hospital assistant for the Asylum has already been submitted, and 1 need not refer to the matter here unless to say that my recommendation has the support of the Principal Medical Officer and the Surgeon General with the Government of India. The deaths were 15 in number : (1) Chronic dysentery.Bhukandai Cachari, criminal. Was admitted into the Asylum on 2nd January 1890 for acute mania, and in apparent good health. His mental condition improved, but his health failed. He got periodical attacks of excitement, and suffered from diarrhoea and dysentery, which became chronic. He died on the 17th March 1893. The post mortem revealed the usual lesions of chronic dysentery in the alimentary canal. (2) Cancrum oris.Sanichur Munda, non-criminal. Was admitted into the Asylum on 7th April 1893 for melancholia and in bad general health, being dropsical and anaemic.

On the night of 28th July 1893 he took a piece of cane 3 feet long out of one of the charpoys of the hospital, and, having tied one end of it round the cross-beam and on the other end having formed a noose, he hanged himself. A police enquiry was held, and two of the Asylum servants were dismissed for neglect of duty. (5) Acute diarrhcea.Kesbou Khasiani, non-criminal from Darrang.

Resolution on the Report of the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1893. Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner of Assam, in the Judicial Branch, No. 2344^., dated the iSth April 1894. Read Letter No. 103T., dated the 1st February 1894, from the Officiating Pr; xipal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam, to the Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam, forwarding the Annual Report of the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1893. RESOLUTION. There were no inmates at the Asylum at the beginning of 1893. Thirty-two were discharged during the year, 13 cured, ^improved, and three not improved. There were two escapes. The daily average number at the Asylum was 102. The number of inmates at the end of the year was 98, of whom 71 were males and 27 females. Of these, 20 males and three females were criminal lunatics, and the rest non-criminal lunatics. Fifty-four of the patients remaining at the end of the year were natives of the Province, and 44 belonged to the immigrant classes. 2. The health of the inmates was not satisfactory. Although the daily average sick-rate (7*40) was somewhat below that of the preceding three years, the death-rate, 14*66 per cent, on the daily average strength, was high. The Chief Commissioner has no doubt, that the continued attention of the Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner and of the Superintendent of the Asylum will be directed to ascertaining and remedying any preventible causes prejudicially affecting the health of the patients. It is reported that the returns of mortality do not include the whole number of inmates who died during the year ; for it is said to have been the practice, in some cases, to send sick inmates to the charitable dispensary for treatment, and to exclude from the Asylum returns those who died there. This is the first time that this practice has been reported to the Chief Commissioner ; and he agrees with the Superintendent and the Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner that it must be discontinued at once, and that sick inmates must be treated at the Asylum hospital only. 3. In his inspection remarks, the Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner has made proposals for revising the establishment attached to the Asylum, and for making certain sanitary improvements. These proposals are under separate consideration ; and some of the improvements recommended have already been sanctioned. 4. The cost per head of inmates increased from Rs. 88-13-10 in 1892 to Rs. 94-7-10 in 1893, chiefly on account of the higher cost of rations. The tables given in paragraph 23 of the Report show, however, that, making allowance for the expensiveness of this Province, the expenditure, on the whole, compares not unfavourably with that of the other Asylums named.
5- It has not been found possible yet to take any substantial step in the direction of introducing manufactures into this small Asylum, but the Chief Commissioner understood, when he inspected the Asylum in February last, that an attempt would be made during the current year to give the non-criminal lunatics some light work to do. A workshed has been erected for sheltering the lunatics so employed. 6. The Asylum has recently been visited by the Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner for Assam, who was accompanied by the Surgeon-Genera[ with the Government of India. The Chief Commissioner observes that Dr. Warburton reports that the condition and management of the Asylum reflect the highest credit on the Superintendent, Surgeon-Major Macnamara. The Chief Commissioner himself on the occasion of his recent inspection expressed himself well satisfied with its internal arrangements. By rder of the Chief Commissioner of Assam, P. G. MELITUS, Ofg. Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam. A. S. P O. (Judl.j No. 48S-'13S19-4-94-

No. 313C. Fhom Surgeon-Colonel A. STEPHEN, Offg, Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner', Assam, To THE SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER OF ASSAM. Camp Dhulrii the 8*/i February 1895. Sir, 1 have the honour to submit the Annual Report and Returns of the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1891, together with a copy of my inspection remarks on the Asylum, written on the 18th of October 1894 and on the 17th of January 1895. These remarks contain all the points requiring action, the note made on the 17th of January having special reference to the excessively high death-rate that occurred in the Asylum during the last quarter of 1894. 2. The explanation called for from Surgeon-Major S. Borah, in Government of India, Home Department (Medical) letter No. 355, dated the 8th June 189i, regarding the practice of sending moribund inmates to the charitable dispensary and of excluding the deaths of those who died there from the asylum returns, was submitted to you along with this ofhee letter No. 1651C, dated the 12th September 1894. 3. The ventilation of the criminal ward was improved during the year by putting additional ventilators in the ceiling, and the practice of washing out the floor of this ward with phenyle has been discontinued, and the floor is now covered to a depth of four inches with earth. The Superintendent has not as yet introduced separate beds in the criminal ward. He considers it essential to have every bed fixed in that ward, so as to prevent, the inmates making use of them as weapons. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, A. STEPHEN, Surgeon-Colonel, Ofg. Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Cowmissioner, Assam.
Copy of INSPECTION REMARKS made by the Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam, on the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum, dated the \&sect;th October 1804. Visitbd the Asylum this morning accompanied by the Superintendent, Dr. Macna-mara. There are at present 118 lunatics in the Asylum, of whom 95 are males and 23 are females. Of the 95 males, 20 are criminal lunatics ; with the exception of one, the females are non-criminal. There were 5 patients in hospital on the date of my visit, 2 of whom were suffering from ancemia, 2 from rheumatism and 1 from dysentery. Sixteen of the inmates have died this year up to date,5 from diseases of the lungs, 3 from phthisis pulmonalis, 1 from asthma, 2 from anaemia, 1 from apoplexy, 1 from cirrhosis of the liver, 1 from dysentery, 1 from diarrhoea and there was a case of suicide. The average population of the Asylum this year has been 101, so that the rate of mortality up to date has been at the annual rate of 192 per thousand. Including the 10 persons who died last year after their removal to the dispensary, there were 25 deaths among lunatics in 1893a death-rate of 245 per thousand, so that the death-rate this year up to date is considerably less than it was last year. The lunatics were well clothed, and they had the appearance of being well looked after. The food supplied for their morning meal was of good quality, and it was well cooked. The Asylum enclosure was in good order, and the wards, recreation shed and hospital were very clean. The earth in use in the latrines was very damp, and that on the mud floor of the wards was also damp. The earth on the asphalt floor of the criminal ward was somewhat drier. It is very difficult to keep a stock of dry earth in a damp climate like that of Tezpur ; but, were the earth spread out on the ground on days when the sun shines for a few hours, and afterwards carefully stored, it would be drier than what I saw in use. The earth spread on the floor of latrines and of wards should be well sifted ; that in use in a portion of the criminal ward was in comparatively large lumps. The Superintendent states that the plan suggested by Dr. Warburton last December of covering the wards with 3 inches of dry earth proved to be very useful during the dry-weather months. He is, however, not so certain of its utility during the rainy months, as he finds it difficult to keep the earth dry. If proper precautions are taken to keep the earth as dry as possible, 1 think Dr. Warburton's recommendation should be acted on even during the rainy months. The inmates are employed in keeping the wards and compound clean and tidy and in the garden. A few of the women have lately been employed in weaving. As in former years, the lunatics are classified as criminals and non-criminals. The establishment consists of an overseer, one jemadar, one compounder, ten male and two female warders. There is no resident hospital assistant, so that medical assistance is not available in cases of emergency. As funds will not permit of the appointment of a special hospital assistant for the Asylum, I think that lie proposal to appoint a hospital assistant who would at the same time perform the duties of overseer, should be carried out. The supply of hot-weather vegetables in the garden was nearly exhausted ; cold-weather seeds had been sown in beds sometime previous to my visit, and arrangements were being made for planting them out. The trenching ground was in good order, and was almost free from smell ; this method of disposing of latrine matters seemed to be efficiently carried out. The drinking water got from a deep masonry well outside the Asylum is of good quality, and the quantity is stated to be sufficient. All the books and registers are properly and carefully kept and are up to date. The good condition in which 1 found the institution as a whole reflects much credit on the management of the Superintendent, Surgeon-Major Macnamara.

Jopy of INSPECTION REMARKS made by the Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam, on the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum on the 17th January 1895. I visited the Lunatic Asylum to-day accompanied by the Superintendent, jurgeon-Major Macnamara. The compound and buildings were very clean and tidy, and there was a large supply of vegetables in the garden. The death-rate during the last quarter of 1894 was enormously high, the principal causes of death having been phthisis pulmonalis and other diseases of the lungs. A hief cause of this high mortality is, 1 believe, dampness of the sleeping barracks. The loors should be leeped as seldom as possible. The experiment of covering them with 2 or 3 inches of dry sand should, I think, be made, the sand being removed every two or three days and replace 1 by fresh sand, and a shed should be provided in which the sand should be stored. The inmates do not get their morning meal till 11 o'clock. Arrangements should be made for giving them this meal at 10 o'clock in the cold weather and not later than 9 o'clock when the days are long. The water in which the rice is boiled should be given to the inmates, as most of the salts of the boiled rice are contained in this water.

No. 14, dated Tezpur, the 21st January 1895. FromSurgeon-Major J. W. Macnamaka, m d., Superintendent of the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum, ToThe Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam. I have the honour to forward herewith the Annual Report and Returns of the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1894. The report has been delayed for the following reasons : (1) The Annual Eeport for 1893 for Asylums in Bengal, which is required for the preparation of the comparative statement of the expenditure of this Asylum and those in -Bengal (vide Principal Medical Officer's letter No. 2665C, dated the 13th September 1892), has not been received from the Inspector General of Civil Hospitals, Bengal, although he had been requested to send it by this office telegram dated the 31st December 1894. (2) The certificate of cash drawn from, and remitted to, the Tezpur treasury during 1894 has only just been furnished by the treasury officer, though he had been requested in this office letter No. 1, dated the 1st January 1895, to supply it early.

ANNUAL REPORT ON THE TEZPUR LUNATIC ASYLUM FOR THE YEAR 1894. 1. Asylum charge.I was in charge as Superintendent of the Asylum during the entire year. 2. Improvements.(a) A masonry cistern with a filter was attached to the well during the year. This enables us to cover in the well, when the cistern is filled ; and although it prevents risk of suicide or accident, we still have to use the primitive rope and bucket to draw up the water. If a pump is added later on, it should be a very substantial one, as there would be difficulty over repairs. (b) The ventilation of 'the criminal ward was improved by putting additional ventilators in the ceiling. (c) The practice of washing out the criminal ward daily with phenyle has been discontinued, and dry earth used instead. The entire floor which is of asphalt is covered 4i inches deep with earth, which is removed where soiled. This plan, suggested by Dr. Warburton in the case of the non-crintinal quarters, is satisfactory where the floor is good beneath the earth ; but, in the case of cuteha floors, it does not answer well, especially in the rains, as the earth gets moist and cakes. In the criminal ward, however, things are different, and the offensive smell, formerly noticeable in the morning after occupation over night', has disappeared. We have not tried separate beds in the criminal ward yet. If we ever do so, it is essential that each bed be fixed and immoveable. (d) The entrance gate needs repairs, which will be seen to this year. A triangular bit of land in front of the Asylum has been laid out as a flower garden. A wooden door now separates the male from the female inmates by day. Two new sheds for work or recreation, as the case may be, have been erected. They will enable us to separate the male inmates into two batchesa very important matter as regards the comfort of the patients. 3. Accommodation.The Asylum contains accommodation for 80 male and 38 female lunatics. The greatest numbers confined in- any one day were 93 males and 23 females, total 116. Overcrowding, lasting about a week, would have occurred only for the use of the hospital and cells for male patients in the ordinary way. 4. Clothing and bedding.The summer elothing was supplied by the Tezpur Jail, as heretofore, and the blankets, which are of a very good quality, by the Bhagulpur Jail. Dhotis and saris are now being made by the inmates at the Asylum. Owing to the nature of the ailments prevailing in the Asylum, it has been decided to give the patients a third blanket at night during the cold weather. 5. Drainage.The drainage of the Asylum is naturally good. No alteration took place during the year. 6. Hospital accommodation.&quot;No change. 7. Water-supply.The water from the Asylum well continues good and abundant. There is no change except the addition of a filter and cistern to the well formerly in use, described in paragraph 2. 8. Conservancy.The dry-earth system (with early removal to trenches) continues to work satisfactorily. 9. Admissions and discharges.The following statement gives particulars of the admissions and discharges for the past two years and the average of the preceding ten years : 1804. 1833.

There were two re-admissions during the year under review ; both patients were previously discharged from this Asylum. 10. Escapes.Three non-criminal male lunatics escaped during the year. They are still at large. One of these lunatics (Binswari coolie) escaped while bathing in the Mora Bharali river, and the other two ( Bhonsa coolie and Birbal alias Budhi Kolita) escaped one while cutting ikra in the jungle, and the otlier while cutting bamboos in a village. The keepers in charge were dismissed for neglect of duty. Notice of these escapes was duly given to the police and the Deputy Commissioner of the district from which the lunatics were received, but no trace of them has yet been found. The following statement shows the duration of the diseases of the patients admitted during the past two years with the average of those admitted during the past ten years, together with the result of treatment as shown by the mode of discharge : Ofth. 321 were i At th Natives of, Otlier prov Total Ofth 12.

The deaths were 28 in number : (1^ Phthisis and old age.Musammat Romoni, non-criminal, aged 66 years, received in good health in May 1885 from Goalpara; health began to fail in January 1890, and was recorded in the case book as bad in December 1892. She was shown as sixty years of age on admission to the Asylum, and was melancholic. On 20th January 1894 she died of phthisis with cavities in her lungs, the diagnosis having been verified by post mortem examination. (2) Apoplexy.Boga Ahom, aged 46, was admitted only on 27th December 1893, and having died on 22nd January 1894, was only 26 days in the Asylum. He was in bad health on admission ; was dirty in his habits, and violent. He tore his cloths, ate bricks, and refused his food. Autopsy revealed cerebral inflammation* (3) Cirrhosis of the liver.Khuda Kachari, aged 42, was in the Asylum since 1st December 1889 ; admitted in indifferent health. His health somewhat improved till August 1893, when it failed. He died of cirrhosis,of the liver, verified post mortem. I am unable to ascertain from the records whether he was addicted to habits of intemperance before admission. (4) Lung disease.Din a Nath, criminal male, aged 52 ; admitted on 18th March 1887 in good health ; was melancholic. Health shown by the case book to have varied from time to time.

past (5) Lung disease.Musammat Budhin, non-criminal, aged 29, was admitted into Asylum on the 7th October 1893 in an indifferent state of health ; previous history very imperfect ; was quarrelsome, dirty in habits, and remained naked. She gradually wasted away, and died of lung disease, most probably contracted before admission on the 8th February 1894. Diagnosis verified post mortem. (6) Lung disease.Khadu coolie, male non-criminal, aged 30, was received into the Asylum on the 27th September 1892 from Dibrugarh in good health. He remained silent, and sat for hours in one place without any object. His health began to fail in September 1893, and got worse gradually. He died on the 19th February 1894. Post mortem showed upper and lower lobes of the right lung to be hepatized.

In January 1894 her health was falling off, and she gradually wasted away and died of lung disease on the 2nd March 1894. Cavity found in \xmgpost mortem. (8) Suicide.Pahlad Ghasi, non-criminal male, was received from the manager of Pratabgarh tea estate on the 1st February 1894. He, on the evening of the 19th March 1894, went to visit the latrine, and took with him a rope made by himself some short time before, while cutting ekra in the jungle, of the bark of a tree, and subsequently used as a cord to fix his dhuti. He tied one end of the rope round his neck and the other end to the bamboo kamis in the roof of the latrine, 5J feet from the ground, and hanged himself. A police enquiry was held, and found it was a case of suicide in which no blame was attached to anybody. (9) Phthisis.Ghundu, non-criminal garden coolie, admitted on the 18th April 1890 in good health, which, however, began to fail in April 1892. He died on the 24th May 1894 of phthisis.

All the internal organs except the lungs (which were found congested) were found more or less anasmic in post mortem examination. While this report was being written, the Principal Medical Officer, Assam, called for an explanation of the heavy mortality in the Asylum, especially during the last quarter of 1894 (vide his letter ' No. 145C, dated the 17th January 1895). I think it better, therefore, to deal with the subject at the end of this list of deaths.
0 I would point out that there are certain circumstances which make percentages delusive in the case of this Asylum, for we are constantly discharging the healthy, while we admit and retain the sick, very often quite restored in mind. In thiB respect, the Asylum partakes largely of the nature of a hospital, and in no way resembles a healthy community. Our inmates arc recruited largely from the most destitute classes, and reach the Asylum, in a very large proportion of cases, in bad health, e.&lt;/., in no less than 16 cases out of the above 28 deaths the patients were actually received in bad health. 3. The lives of the large majority of our lunatics are beyond doubt prolonged by their being sent to the Asylum ; and to attribute any blame to the Asylum in consideration of these cases alone would be unfair. However, during the past year a very large number of deaths occurred from lung diseasea number out of all proportions to what occurs among the general public, allowing for the fact that lunatics (who throw off their clothes, go naked, refuse their food, and are dirty in their habits) are more liable to lung disease than others. Still the number is excessive, and I think these are the deaths for which some explanation should be found with a view to preventive measures being taken. Since the close of the year I had the good fortune to have the Asylum inspected by the Sanitary Commissioner, Assam, with special reference to the mortality from lung complaints. I think 1 am correct in saying he found no serious defects in our general sanitary arrangements, but considered that the Asylum buildings were damp to an extent sufficient to account for the prevalence and fatality from distinctive pulmonary diseases. The lunatics are well fed (getting an abundance of fresh vegetables daily), the latrine arrangements and water-supply are good, and the clothing, now that three blankets are given at night, is fairly satisfactory. I believe that excessive dampness is the main cause of our preventible sickness-Earthen floors with open walls are necessarily damp in Assam ; and when such buildings are used for lunatics who soil the floors, dryness is rendered more difficult. Dry earth spread in a layer over the floors was tried, but it caked in a day or two and became useless. Now we are going to try river sand at the Deputy Commissioner's suggestion. The question of high mortality was considered by the Deputy Commissioner and myself on the 30th November last. We came to the conclusion that cold and damp had a good deal to say to it, and on this account we advised an extra blanket at night in the cold weather. I don't think I can do better than quote the following passage from the proceedings oi the Committee held on the 30th November last: Tho Committee considered a letter from the Chief Commissioner, through the Deputy Surgeon General, on the subject of the high mortality in the Asylum during the first three quarters of the current year. Tho year has been an unhealthy year in the district, but the Committee also believe that the mortality is to bo attributed to the fact that many lunatics received from tea-gardens are received in a bad state of health. The inmates aro chiefly foreigners, often received in a destitute condition. Twenty-two out of thirty-five lunatics received in 1893 were foreigners, and of the balance of thirteen received from Lakhimpur, Sibsagar, or Mangaldai, many no doubt were garden coolies. In the opinion of the Committee the Asylum cannot bo fairly compared with Bengal asylums. In many cases the so-called lunatics are idiots, who have no friends and the locality of whose homes it is impossible to ascertain. . The buildings in some respects arc very suitable. They are inexpensive and easily removed if contaminated by cholera discharges. The only suggestion I can make with a view to improvement is that the plinths be made pucca by degrees, say, one each year, as prison labour is available, The lunatics themselves could do a portion of the work, and the cost would not be very great. The onset of all destructive lung diseases is insidious, and I would again urge the desirability of a resident hospital assistant who would be always present to see the lunatics properly fed and treated, and to look after their welfare generally. I know this suggestion has been more than once objected to on the score of cost. A good hospital assistant might be put in subordinate medical charge (in place of the present jemadar, if economy is necessary). I think that as a jail with 130 prisoners has a hospital assistant in immediate charge, that a similar number of lunatics, nearly all physically as well as mentally weak, should have one too. Although the mortality for the year is high, there has been no cause acting in 1894 that was not acting in other years. It was a very wet and unhealthy year. We sent no patients from the Asylum to the dispensary as mentally improved, but we reversed the process, transferring some two patients from the dispensary (largely overcrowded at the time) to the Asylum. 19.

ASSAM SECRETARIAT PRINTING DEPARTMENT (JUDICIAL) No. 48012413-&95. &#9632;
Resolution on the Report of the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1894. Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner of Assam in the Judicial Branch, No. 2518^., dated the 20th May 1895. Read- Letter No. 313C, dated the 8th February 1895, from the Officiating Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam, to the Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam, forwarding (he Annual Report of the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1894. RESOLUTION. There were 98 inmates, 71 males and 27 females, at the Asylum at the beginning of the year. Forty-six new patients were admitted during the year, of whom five were females. Ten inmates were discharged, eight males and two females, all cured. There were three escapes and 28 deaths. The number of inmates remaining at the end of the year was 105, 83 males and 22 females; of these, 18 males and one female were criminal lunatics, and the rest non-criminal lunatics. The daily average number at the Asylum during the year was 106. Only 48 of the inmates remaining at the end of the year were natives of the Province, while 57 belonged to the immigrant classes. 2. Practically, the only point in the Report which calls for notice from the Chief Commissioner is the high mortality which occurred during the year. The health of the inmates, as judged by the daily average number sick (5*24), would at first sight appear to have been satisfactory, for this average is lower than that returned in any year since 1887. The number of deaths (28), however, was very large. The high mortality attracted the Chief Commissioner's attention during the year; and, under his orders, a special enquiry was made, the results of which are set forth at the end of paragraph 18 of the Report and in the Inspection Note of the Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, dated the 17th January 1895, attached to the Report. Diseases of the lungs were the principal causes of death, and enquiry has shown their prevalence during the year to have been due, to a considerable extent, to damp and cold. The latter defect has been remedied by the issue of extra blankets during the cold-weather months. It is reported that dry earth spread over the floor of the wards has not been found to be a completely successful remedy against damp ; the experiment is now being tried of spreading sand from the river. The Superintendent again raises the question of appointing a separate Hospital Assistant for the Asylum. If the Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner considers such an appointment to be really necessary, the Chief Commissioner will be prepared to reconsider the matter; but he does not consider that sufficient ground has been shown hitherto for providing another special medical officer besides the Superintendent himself to look after the medical wants of a small Asylum like that of Tezpur.
3. The causes of the high mortality were considered by a Committee of the Visitors of the Asylum held on the 30th November last, at which the Deputy Commissioner of the district and the Superintendent of the Asylum were present, and the remarks reproduced in paragraph 18 of the Report were recorded in explanation, of the high death-rate generally in this Asylum. The substance of these remarks is that the mortality in this Asylum cannot fairly be compared with the mortality in Asylums in other Provinces, as so large a proportion of the inmates consists of destitute and homeless immigrants, who are in a bad state of health when first admitted to the Asylum. The Chief Commissioner is prepared to admit that the view of the Committee is correct to a great extent, and that the death-rate at Tezpur must, for the reasons stated, always be expected to be somewhat higher than the death-rate in other Asylums. But as shown above, this explanation does not fully account for the high mortality, and there are also certain preventible causes of sickness which have to be remedied. 4. The practice of sending sick inmates to the Charitable Dispensary for treatment instead of treating them in the hospital attached to the -Asylum was referred to in the Resolution reviewing the Report for 1893. This practice has been discontinued under the Chief Commissioner's orders. The Chief Commissioner now observes that the Superintendent reports that sick inmates are retained in the Asylum very often after they have been quite restored in mind, and that two patients were transferred during the year from the Charitable Dispensary, which was overcrowded at the time, to the Asylum for treatment. It is not stated whether these two patients were insane or not. The Chief Commissioner sees no reason why inmates who are quite restored in mind should be retained at the Asylum, and he would prefer that, whenever practicable, they should be discharged from the Asylum and senc to the Charitable Dispensary for treatment. It is further obviously objectionable that patients in the Charitable Dispensary suffering from purely physical ailments should be sent to the Asylum hospital. The Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner should issue instructions to &lt;*ive effect to these views. The question of overcrowding at the Tezpur Charitable Dispensary is being separately dealt with in connection with the Annual Report on Dispensaries. 5. The Report contains no account of the occupation of the lunatics. In future reports it should be stated in what way they are employed, and to what extent it has been found possible to employ them under shelter, as suggested by the Government of India on more than one occasion. At his inspection of the Asylum in December last* however the Chief Commissioner ascertained that not much progress had been made in this direction, great difficulty having been experienced in giving lunatics employment under shelter without putting dangerous implements into their hands. 6. The Chief Commissioner at his inspection was well satisfied with the arrangements at the Asylum ; and although he has had to criticise the Report in respect of the points dealt with in the preceding paragraphs, he endorses the opinion of the Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner that the good condition of the institution, as a whole, reflects credit on the management of the Superintendent, Surgeon-Major Macnamara.
