Friends or relatives will not come forward to accept the risk and trouble that is involved in caring for mental patients in their own homes. Minbu Hospital admitted six observation cases, four were found to be insane, two were discharged. Forty-seven per cent. of all admissions are from Rangoon and are usually of the cultivator class. 5. Statement V shows that 75 per cent. of all admitted are between 20 and 40 years of age. 6. Statement VI shows the various factors which contributed to mental breakdown in patients during 1927. During the year, 276 insanes were admitted to Rangoon HospitalFOR THE YEAR 1927. 3 cases recovered under treatment and careful nursing. All dysentery cases are segregated for two months after recovery. There were 32 epileptics and 913 fits were observed and recorded, and 39 patients were artificially fed. All newly admitted cases were vaccinated. The whole population (including staff) were re-vaccinated during 1926. At Minbu, the general health was good throughout the year. There was no epidemic disease in the institution, though cholera and plague were prevalent outside in town and district. There were 56 deaths (48 males and 8 females), and 9 cases for observation, brought in a very weak state, died (7 males and 2 females), this compares with 57 deaths and 3 deaths (observation cases) in 1926. The daily average sick was 42.20 in 1927 ; 29.08 in 1926 ; 77.70 in 1925. Percentage of deaths to average population 6.07 in 1927 ; 6.72 in 1926 ; 9.43 in 1925. Dysentery, pulmonary tuberculosis, pneumonia, exhaustion from dementia and nephritis, accounted for most of the deaths. Two deaths at Minbu were due to senility. 7.

Diets.FOR THE YEAR 1927. 5 paraldehyde, sulphonal and trional were the most generally used drugs for treatment. A few cases needed hyoscine injections, where excite- ment was extreme. Strict personal hygiene and a suitable occupation were the chief factors in treatment. Water for drinking, for washing and the garden is derived from wells in both hospitals. At Tadagale, 2 tube wells out of 4 borings have been in use. One failed, the 12 inches casing pipe having broken 200 feet below the surface, hence water consumption was reduced as far as possible. The fourth boring proved a failure and the Superintendent reports that the third well is not likely ever to work. 14.

The old Asylum at St. John's Road was finally vacated on the 30th December 1928 and handed over to the Public Works Depart- ment. At the new Asylum at Tadagale both accommodation and sanitation are satisfactory. It must be noted here that the institution is in difficulty as regards water supply. The tube wells have proved insufficient, and at present the deficiency is being made good from the municipal supply. This is, however, a temporary expedient and the subject of water supply is still under consideration. Additions and alterations to the quarters of both the Superintendent and his Deputy were carried out by the Public Works Department. Concrete beds for all male sections were provided and the old wooden beds in the female section were replaced by concrete bedsteads. The portion of the north-western wall which gave way during the rain storm on the 20th May 1928 was rebuilt with additional safeguards during the year. 2. Accommodation.2 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE MENTAL HOSPITALS IN BURMA 3. Population.FOR THE YEAR 1928. 3 prolonged mental stress ; 35 to privation and starvation ; 13 to excessive indulgence in alcohol, and 13 were drug addicts. Ten were due to acquired syphilis. This is not very great in view of the extent to which venereal diseases are prevalent in Rangoon. There were 35 cases of epilepsy, 51 were imbeciles (probably the result of congenital mental deficiency) ; mania acute intermittent greatly predominates over melancholia ; but 57 cases of mania are returned as cured. Twelve cases of mania and six of melancholia are associated with old age. The admission of males is a little over 5 times that of the females (males 227, females 44, total 271) because females are easier to control and so kept at home. 8. Statement VII deals with the supposed causes of insanity of patients showing the predisposing and exciting causes. 24 per cent of the total admission was under '' Infective and Toxic conditions " as in previous year, though the number dropped from 95 in 1927 to 66 in 1928. Further, there is a perceptible decrease in the number of cases of insanity caused by alcoholic indulgence. 9. Health and Mortality4 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE MENTAL HOSPITALS IN BURMA, The seven persons who died in the Minbu Mental Hospital, were all well-advanced in age. The causes of death were lobar pneumonia senile decay, double lobar pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis, chronic interstinal nephritis, tubercular peritonitis. There are 44 epileptics ; 824 fits were observed and noted. Twenty-three patients were artificially fed. 10. Escapes, Accidents and Suicides.FOR THE YEAR 1928. 5 Hospital. To minimise the expenditure of tube well water, action is being initiated to have all automatic flushes converted into control flushes. The Superintendent, Mental Hospital, Tadagale, estimates the average daily consumption at 96,000 gallons of water against a daily yield by tube wells of 85,000 gallons. The daily average quantity of water taken from the Corporation Main was 24,000 gallons from 28th November to 17th December 1928. No water was obtained through this source till the end of the year. The daily average varies to some extent with the seasons of the year. 14. Garden and Dairy.6 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE MENTAL HOSPITALS IN BURMA, The following were the donations in money and kind received from the public :FOR THE YEAR 1928. 7 under contingencies. The total expenditure under this head during the year was Rs. 86,255 which includes Rs. 55,192 for lighting and power alone. The average cost for each insane was Rs. 385 in 1928 against Rs. 324 in 1927, a little more than last year and seems to be due to charges for lighting and power Rs. 55,192. 20. Committee.APPENDICES.

At Minbu the year commenced with 105 and ended with 100. The average was 103.08 and the largest number confined on any one night was 106. 5. Admissions and Discharges.IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1931. 3 8. Statement V.4 NOTE ON THE MENTAL HOSPITALS erotic and epileptic insanes, and those of defective habits were kept apart. Suicidal and homicidal cases were subjected to close supervision. Efforts to promote the welfare of the patients amongst other measures, included attention to strict personal hygiene, diet, rest, fresh air, sun- light, judicious exercise, suitable occupation, discipline, games and amusements. Sympathy and tact in the handling of patients were scrupulously observed, and privileges consistant with safety were per- mitted. Sleeplessness was treated by hypnotics, and sedatives such as Bromide of Potassium, Paraldehyde, Sulphonal, Chloral Hydrate, Trional and Hyocyine Hydro-bromide, and by prolonged tepid baths in very restless cases. The treatment of cases of Paresis by intramuscular injections of Collosal Sulphur started towards the end of 1930 was found unsatis- factory, as the improvement was only temporary. In September 1931, Pyrexia was induced in these cases by intramuscular injections of Citrated Benign tartian Malarial blood. In cases where there was no reaction and in those where there were not a sufficient number of satis- factory rises of temperature, the injections were repeated. The total number of cases thus treated to date were 14. The results were- markedly improved 2 ; improved 5 ; slight improvement 2 ; symptoms arrested 3 ; Malaria just induced 12 ; result not known 1 ; and no reaction yet, 1. It is interesting to note that all Genera Paralysis of the insane cases, either admitted or subsequently diagnosed as such, have with the exception of two cases invariably become steadily worse and died. The interval between the first onset of the symptoms and death varied with the severity of each case. 14. Sanitation and Conservancy.IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1931. 5 Rs. 3-11-7 per mensem per patient. Of the above water consumption, 12,750,550 gallons were obtained at a cost of Rs. 12,750-10-0 or Re. 1, per 1,000 gallons from the Rangoon Corporation Main, and 25,560,250 gallons from the Hospital tube wells at a cost of Rs. 37,912-15-0 or Rs. 1-9-9 per 1,000 gallons. The Corporation has since been approached to reduce its rate for water supply from its Main to As. 8, per 1,000 gallons. The water from the tube wells has averaged 59,100 gallons per day as against 70,000 gallons during 1930, indicating a steady decrease in production and necessitating progressive increase in the use of Municipal water. It is a most urgent matter that some economical arrangement should be evolved for obtaining a reasonably cheap supply of water to the Mental Hospital, Tadagale. A scheme for further tube wells has been drawn up which estimates production cost to be reduced to As. 9 per 1,000 gallons. It is unfortunate that relatively few tube wells maintain their early promising estimates. The period of curtailments of capital expenditure now prevailing might well be devoted to exploring every other possible source of economic supply in order that, if possible, an abundant and cheap supply of water may eventually be available to this hospital, where the difficulties of and need for maintaining a high standard of cleanliness are greater than can be realised without actual experience in this work. At Minbu the water supply, as in the previous year, was obtained from the Municipal Reservoir by means of pipes, and stored in tanks within the hospital compound. The water was good and ample through- out the year. 16. Garden and Dairy.6 NOTE ON THE MENTAL HOSPITALS 18.

RESOLUTION ON THE Note on Mental Hospitals in Burma FOR THE YEAR 1933. Extract from the Proceedings of the Government of Burma (Ministry of Education), BURMA. MEDICAL DEPARTMENT .2 NOTE ON THE MENTAL HOSPITALS Statement Nos. I and I A. 4. Admissions and Discharges.IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1933. 3 Statement No. V. 8. The ages of patients admitted to the two institutions is shown in Statement No. V. It brings out no point calling for comment. Statement No. VI. 9. The type of insanity of the patients in the two institutions is classified in Statement No. VI, from a scrutiny of which it will be seen that there were treated during the year 86 cases of insanity, classified as due to " errors of development," 507 patients were treated for mania, 354 for melancholia, 21 circular insanity, 7 stupor, and 47 delusional insanity- Insanity of toxic origin included 95 cases of general paralysis of the insane, 27 cases due to alcohol, 21 cases due to cannabis indica (ganja), whilst 260 cases of dementia praecox were treated. The most striking feature about these figures is the number of cases of General Paralysis of the Insane, which is a reflection of the prevalence of syphilis in Burma and more especially in Rangoon. Statement No. VII. 10. The 4 NOTE ON THE MENTAL HOSPITALS remission, one showed no improvement, and one died. Twenty patients were treated with sulfosin, 3 showed good remission, 16 remained stationary, and one showed no improvement, whilst 7 were treated by malarial therapy plus tryparsamide, of whom 6 showed good remission, and one remained stationary. The general conclusion reached was that malaria therapy if given during the early stages of the disease was beneficial. 12. Escapes, Accidents and Suicides.IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1933. 5 15.

RESOLUTION ON THE Note on the Mental Hospitals in Burma For the Year 1935. Extract from the Proceedings of the Government of Burma (Ministry of Education) No. 153SJ36, dated the 1st July 1936. READBURMA. MEDICAL DEPARTMENT2 NOTE ON THE MENTAL HOSPITALS 145 (127 males and 18 females) were discharged as "Cured"; 76 as '' Improved"; and 11 as '' Discharged otherwise." The percentage of '' Cured " to " Admissions" was 23.08 as against 18.18 in 1933. At Minbu one patient was discharged as " Improved" and another " Discharged otherwise." During the year 1935, a proposal for boarding out such harmless lunatics as required no treatment, in Phôngyi kyaungs, etc., under the care of local bodies was submitted to Government for consideration but it was dropped in view of the fact that a similar experiment which was made in 1931 did not provide grounds for belief that the scheme in question would be likely to succeed. It is interesting however to record that at the instance of the Mental Hospital, Tadagale, paragraph 4 of Judicial Department Circular No. 18 of 1913 was amended in July 1935 by the Local Government, so as to ensure that only criminal lunatics, lunatics who are absolutely dangerous and those lunatics who may be in the acute stage in which there is most hope of recovery from medical treatment, be admitted. It is hoped that this amendment will have the desired effect of reducing the numbers at the Mental Hospital, Tadagale. 5. (c) Health and Mortality.IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1935. 3 9. At Tadagale " Mental Deficiency " accounted for 78 cases, Mania for 362, Melancholia for 234, Schizophrenia including Dementia Pnæcox for 253, Secondary Dementia for 35, Epilepsy and epileptic insanity for 39, Toxic Psychoses for 99 and Organic Psychoses for 164 cases, which includes 112 cases of the General Paralysis of the Insane, once again indicating in one form the disastrous results of the infection of syphilis. At Minbu more or less the same ratio in regard to the mental disorders was main- tained. Statement VI. Statement VII. 10. There were no admissions into the Mental Hospital, Minbu, during the year and no statistics for that hospital are therefore furnished in this statement. At Tadagale '' Mental Stress " was responsible for 28 admissions, while "Toxins," '' Infection" and "Old Age" accounted for 82, 67 and 122 cases respectively. Treatment. 11. (a) Tadagale.4 NOTE ON THE MENTAL HOSPITALS 12. Fresh food, fresh milk, raw vegetables, marmite, half-boiled liver were given to anæmic and under nourished patients with beneficial results. All the patients were vaccinated during the year under report. 13. (b) Minbu.IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1935. 5 21. Of the above water consumption 14,315,300 gallons were obtained from the Rangoon Corporation main at the rate of annas 8 per 1,000 gallons while about 26,752,000 gallons were pumped out from the hospital tube wells ; the cost of current used in pumping this water being Rs. 2,881 or one anna nine pies per 1,000 gallons. The daily average consumption for the ordinary hospital requirements (except lake water) has been 112,513 gallons per day out of which 73,293 gallons were obtained from tube wells and 39,220 gallons from the Rangoon Corporation main. There has been an increase in the output of tube-well water during the year under report, the average per day during 1934 being 65,358 gallons. 22. (b) Minbu.6 NOTE ON THE MENTAL HOSPITALS in all at Rs. 4,395-9-4 (Rs. 15,275-3-9). These vegetables were utilized chiefly for the patients while the surplus was sold to the staff as shown below ? Rs.

The yield on the whole has been fairly good ; the decrease in the cash value is due to the price of vegetables being reduced from. 2 annas to 6 pies per pound. This is however merely a paper transaction and no actual decrease in the cash realization since the vegetables were used for the patients of the hospital. The hospital continued to maintain its dairy. The milk obtained therefrom which was valued at Rs. 6,640-6-9 (Rs. 6,128-9-9) was disposed as under :IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1935. 7 causing his death from shock within a few minutes. Post-mortem revealed no signs of injury. No implement was used and the act was too sudden for the keeper-in-charge to control the aggressor. 32. Criminal patient Nga Thein Maung committed suicide by hanging himself in the bath-room in the early hours of a morning. The patient was sane and showed no signs of premeditation. There were no escapes. 33. (b) Minbu.8 NOTE ON THE MENTAL HOSPITALS IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1935.

RESOLUTION ON THE Annual Report on Mental Hospitals in Burma For the Year 1936. Extract from the Proceedings of the Government of Burma, Public Health Department, No. 160SJ37, dated the 18th April 1937. READBURMA. MEDICAL DEPARTMENT2 ANNUAL REPORT ON MENTAL HOSPITALS were 75 of which 69 (55 males and 14 females) occurred at Tadagale and 6 (males) at Minbu. The high number of deaths at the Mental Hospital, Tadagale, may be attributed to the fact that the cases of General Paralysis of the Insane were received in an advanced stage when treatment was of no avail. Statement III. 6. Criminal Lunatics.IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1936. 3 the open with attendants and it was found that this method was more effective in making them quieter. Continuous hot baths were given for restless patients and Paraldehyde is the most common soporific used. As far as possible, acute recoverable cases were kept apart from the chronic patients. Cases of General Paralysis of the Insane were treated by means of pyrexial treatment induced by means of intravenous injections of T.A.B. vaccine followed by injections of Tryparsamide, mercurials and Bismuth. Induction of Pyrexia by means of inoculation of malarial blood had to be abandoned on account of the risk of cerebral malaria, due to mixture of M.T. Malaria in the donor or sometimes of a recrudescence of M.T. Malaria in the patient himself. (b) Minbu.4 ANNUAL REPORT ON MENTAL HOSPITALS pumped out from the hospital tube wells. Cost of electric current used in pumping water from the tube wells to the reservoir was Rs. 2,578 or 4 annas 4 pies per 1,000 gallons. The daily average con- sumption was 69,810 (112,513) gallons. Of this, 43,747 gallons were drawn from the Rangoon Corporation main and 26,063 pumped out from tube wells. The output from the tube wells decreased during the year as one well failed on the 12th May 1936 and the others could not be worked to their full capacity owing to their being in close proximity to each other. On account of the scarcity of water the supply had to be restricted. The continued restriction is however a potential danger to the health of the institution. A new scheme to ensure adequate water supply is now under consideration. (b) Minbu.IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1936. 5 The yield for this year fell short by Rs. 254-1-4 as compared with previous year, and this can only be attributed to scarcity of water. The hospital farm was extended during the year by addition of waste land in the vicinity of septic tanks and this is used for growing guinea grass for the hospital cattle. Trees, e.g., plantain, papayas, etc., have also been planted there. The hospital continued maintaining its dairy. The milk produced during the year amounted to Rs. 6,313-1-6 (Rs. 6,640-6-9) which was disposed of as shown below :6 ANNUAL REPORT ON MENTAL HOSPITALS IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1936. Statement VIII. 18. The total expenditure for the year of both the institutions was Rs. 478,068-12-7 (Rs. 496,630-0-2). The total receipts during the year were Rs. 4,72,591-15-1 (Rs. 4,89,793-3-5). The decrease in both receipts and expenditure is due to the reduction in the number of inmates in the hospitals. The average cost per patient was Rs. 295 (Rs. 249) at Tadagale and Rs. 147-12-3 (Rs. 137-13-5) at Minbu. The increase in the rate at Tadagale is due to the decrease in the number of patients while the increase in the rate at Minbu is mainly due to the increased expenditure under establishment. 19.

RESOLUTION ON THE Annual Report on Mental Hospitals in Burma For the Year 1938. Extract from the Proceedings of the Government of Burma, Medical Branch, No. 5GX39, dated the 11th April 1939. READBURMA. MEDICAL DEPARTMENT2 ANNUAL REPORT ON MENTAL HOSPITALS 309 patients (254 males and 55 females) as compared with 366 (296 males and 70 females) in the previous year, whilst at Minbu there were no admissions during the year under report. The decrease in the number of admissions was presumably due to Magistrates committing only the dangerous type of patients and the patients in whom hope of recovery was probable. The number of discharges from the Mental Hospital, Tadagale, was 222 as against 340 in the previous year. Of the 222 patients discharged, 126 were discharged as " recovered ", 73 as " improved " and 23 as " discharged otherwise." The percentage of cures to admissions during the year at the Mental Hospital, Tadagale, was 19.74 (35.11). At Minbu, no patient was discharged during the year. The reason for the lower percentage of cures is because a more definite standard of cure was insisted upon. 5. Health and Mortality.IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1938. 3 patients respectively out of a total of 769 patients. Schizophrenia is perhaps the gravest of all the mental diseases, and it is therefore all the more interesting to note that at the Mental Hospital, Tadagale, during the year under report, a number of cases of Schizophrenia were treated by modern methods, i.e., " Hypoglycæmic shock treatment," as intro- duced by Dr. Manfred Sakel in Vienna and " Convulsion Therapy " as introduced by Dr. Ladislaus Von Meduna. Ten cases were treated by the Hypoglycæmic method during the year under report; of these four cases recovered completely, four improved and two showed no improvement. Fourteen cases were treated by Convulsion Therapy method ; of these five cases recovered completely, four cases improved and five cases did not respond. The recovery rate is most favourable for cases of recent duration and diminishes steadily in proportion to the number of years that the condition has been present. There have been no untoward effects or casualties with this method of treatment, nor with the Insulin Treatment. But the Cardiazol method is more suitable and it has now almost superseded the Hypoglycæmic shock treatment as it is easier to perform and requires less observation and time and it is less costly. However, occasionally, the two methods are combined with advantage. Cases of Manic Depressive Insanity are now also being treated in this manner with good results to date. Malarial treatment for cases of General Paralysis of the Insane was given during the year. 22 patients were treated and 11 reacted well. There is no doubt that Malarial Therapy is the best treatment for General Paralysis of the Insane in the present state of our knowledge. It is pointed out that the earlier treatment can be undertaken, the better is the prognosis. It is regretted that many cases are still admitted in a very advanced condition. It is to be hoped that every endeavour will be made by the profession to recognize this condition in its early stage and per- suade the patients to submit to adequate treatment in this institution. Other routine methods of treatment were continued as in the preceding years, viz., attention to general health, occupation and recreation. Blood of all cases was sent to the Pasteur Institute for examination for Wassermann Reaction, and if the result was positive, the Cerebro- spinal fluid was also sent. Out of 244 blood specimens, 74 showed positive reactions. Statement VII. 10. At Tadagale there, were 56 cases for " Mental Stress ", 113 for " Toxins ", 75 for " Infections " and 120 for " Old Age " (including 32 " Unascertained cases"). There were no admissions at Minbu. Statement VIII. 11. The total receipts for the year at both the institutions was Rs. 4,18,082-5-6 (Rs. 4,45,405-10-0) and the total expenditure was Rs. 4,33,610-2-6 (Rs. 4,50,623-11-0). The average cost per patient was Rs. 363 (Rs. 328)
4 ANNUAL REPORT ON MENTAL HOSPITALS at Tadagale. The decrease in both Receipts and Expenditure was due to the reduction in the number of patients. The increase in the average cost per patient at Tadagale was due to the overhead charges being distributed over a lesser number of patients. 12. Miscellaneous.IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1938. 5 1938 till the end of the year. Dr. C. S. Krishnaswamy, L.M.& S. (Mad.), continued throughout the year in collateral charge of the Mental Hospital, Minbu.

BURMA. MEDICAL DEPARTMENT-NO. 50202 ANNUAL REPORT ON MENTAL HOSPITALS that hospital for only criminal patients and acute recoverable patients was strictly adhered to. The number of discharges at Tadagale was 276 (240 males and 36 females) of whom 184 (162 males and 22 females) were classified as " Cured," 66 (52 males and 14 females) as " Improved" and 26 as " Discharged otherwise." The percentage of " Cures " to " Admissions " was 31.12 as against 19.74 in the previous year. The increase is due to a larger number of recoveries of those affected with " Mania " and " Schizophrenia including Dementia Præcox." Health and Mortality. 5. There were 95 deaths (79 males and 16 females) at Tadagale and 5 at Minbu, as compared with a total of 93 in the previous year. The percentage of deaths to the daily average population at both institutions was 11.23 as against 10.57. These figures indicate a fair degree of constancy, but they are high in comparison with those of Mental Hospitals in India owing to the large percentage of admissions in Burma for " General Paralysis of the Insane " in which disease the mortality is high. The percentage of admissions for General Paralysis of the Insane was even higher than in the previous years. Out of 331 admissions at the Mental Hospital, Tadagale, 96 were for " General Paralysis of the Insane," i.e.) 29 per cent as against 20 per cent in the previous year. Of the 95 deaths at the Mental Hospital, Tadagale. " General Paralysis of the Insane" accounted for as many as 46. The Medical Superintendent, Mental Hospital, Tadagale, reports that patients suffering from this mental disorder were received in an advanced state. Statement III. 6. Criminal Lunatics.IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1939. 3 Statement VI. 9. The form of mental disorders in the admissions, discharges, recoveries, and deaths in the two institutions is classified in Statement No. VI, from a scrutiny of which it will be seen that there were 64 admissions on account of " Mania" ; 73 on account of " Schizophrenia including Dementia Præcox ; " 40 for " Acute Confusional Insanity " and 96 for " General Paralysis of the Insane ". The most striking feature about these figures is the number of cases of General Paralysis of the Insane which is a reflection on the prevalence of Syphilis in Burma. 10.

BURMA. MEDICAL DEPARTMENT2 ANNUAL REPORT ON MENTAL HOSPITALS The number of discharges at Tadagale was 245 (200 males and 45 females) as against 276 in 1939. 171 (142 males and 29 females) were classified as ''Cured " 66 (50 males and 16 females) as '' Improved " and 8 as '' Discharged Otherwise.'' The percentage of " Cures " to '' Admissions " was 27.49 as against 31.12 and 19.74 in the two preceding years. Except in respect of the reduced total number of discharges the remainder of the figures above do not evoke comment. The reduction in the number of discharges was due to the fact that 22 patients were transferred to the Mental Hospital at Minbu in 1939, while in 1940 no such transfer took place. Health and Mortality. 5. There were 117 (95) deaths (93 males and 24 females) at Tadagale and 6 (5) at Minbu as compared with the total of 100 in 1939. (In addition to the 117 deaths at Tadagale there were 9 deaths amongst Observation Cases). The number of deaths in the Mental Hospital at Minbu is constant and does not therefore call for any remarks. The percentage of deaths to daily average in respect of the Mental Hospital at Tadagale was 15.57 as against 12.19 in 1939 and 11.54 in 1938. The increase was due to the large number of admissions for General Paralysis of the Insane, the majority of which cases were received in the final stage of the disease where treatment was of no avail. There were 10 deaths also from ''Secondary Dementia." Statement III. 6. Criminal Lunatics.IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1940. 3 Statement V. 8. The ages of patients admitted at both the Mental Hospitals in Burma is shown in Statement V. As usual, those between the ages of 20 and 40 accounted for a preponderating number. There were 240 (62.8 per cent) admissions of those between the ages referred to above. Those between the ages of 40 and 60 claim the next highest number i.e., 111 or 29.6 per cent. Statement VI. 9. The form of " Mental Disorders " in the Admissions, Discharges, Recoveries and Deaths in the two institutions is classified in Statement VI from a scrutiny of which it will be seen that there were 67 (64) admissions on account of "Mania" ; 63 (67) on account of ''Schizophrenia including Dementia Praecox " ; 38 (39) for ''Acute Confusional Insanity " and 86 (96) for '' General Paralysis of the Insane. " The figures for '' General Paralysis of the Insane reflect the degree of prevalence of syphilis in Burma." In regard to " Recoveries " it may be mentioned that there were 56 (55) on account of ''Mania " ; 41 (65) on account of Schizophrenia including Dementia Praecox " ; 32 (28) on account of ''Acute Confusional Insanity" ; and 41 (43) on account of '' General Paralysis of the Insane.

To the above officers and to the staffs of both these institutions acknowledgment is due for the satisfactory manner in which they carried out their duties. I take this opportunity of recording the unfortunate loss sustained by the Mental Hospital, Minbu by the untimely death of U Hla Pe, who was Deputy Medical Superintendent for two years prior to the date of his death. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, H. S. CORMACK, M.C., I.M.S., Offg. Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Burma.
