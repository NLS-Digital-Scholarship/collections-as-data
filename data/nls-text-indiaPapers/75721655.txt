No. 5251A. FROM S. G. HART, ESQ., I.C.S., DIRECTOR, DEPARTMENT Of AGRICULTURE, EASTERN BENGAL AND ASSAM, To THE CHIEF SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF EASTERN BENGAL AND ASSAM. Shillong, the 20th July 1907 - Sir, I HAVE the honour to forward the report on the working of the Veterinary Department during the year ending on the 31st March 1907. The report has, at my request, been written by Mr. W. Harris, i.c.v.d. who not having joined his post in this province till recently, has been seriously handi- capped in reviewing work with which he had no concern. Mr. Harris has taken a great deal of trouble and has undoubtedly produced a workmanlike report making the best use of the imperfect material available. During the year there was, strictly speaking, no Veterinary Department in this province. One Inspector was paid from Provincial, two Assistants from Khas Mahal, and nine Assistants from District Board funds. Since the close of the year there has been a great development and fourteen new Veterinary Assistants have already been posted to this province. In addition to the above, the Surma Valley Branch of the Indian Tea Association have, with the aid of a Government grant of Rs. 15,000 and various contributions from Local Boards, employed a fully qualified Veterinary Surgeon, Mr. W. H. McCaldron, M.R.C.V.S., with three Indian Assistants. Their special work is to inoculate cattle in tea gardens and villages against rinderpest, a scourge which has caused great havoc among cattle in all parts of the Surma Valley during the last two years. Mr. Mccaldron joined his post on the 24th February 1907. Monthly reports of the work done by him are being submitted to Government. Up to the 31st March, Mr. McCaldron and one Veterinary Assistant inoculated 6,674 cattle, of which only 16 are reported to have subsequently died, though most of the inoculation was done in villages where rinder- pest had already established a firm hold. In addition to Mr. McCaldron's staff, three of the Local Boards of the Surma Valley now have Veterinary Assistants of their own and that number will probably be increased shortly. There is good reason to believe that rinderpest is now abating. In April last, a cattle census was held in Cachar partly in order to ascertain by how much the number of cultivators' cattle had been reduced during the long con- tinued outbreak of epidemic disease. The last previous census was held in 1902 and the principal variations brought out are :REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPAETMENT, EASTERN BENGAL AND ASSAM, FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31st MARCH 1907.

HART, ESQ., I.C.S., DIRECTOR, DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, EASTERN BENGAL AND ASSAM, To THE CHIEF SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF EASTERN BENGAL AND ASSAM, Shillong, the 24th July 1908. SIR, I HAVE the honour to forward the Report of the Veterinary Department of this province for the year 1907-08, together with a report by Mr. McCaldron, the special Veterinary Officer employed under the Surma Valley Branch of the Tea Asso- ciation. 2. Mr. McCaldron's services were enlisted at a time when the Department was hopelessly undermanned and quite unable to cope with the epidemic of rinderpest which was sweeping away vast numbers of the cattle in the villages and tea-gardens of the Surma Valley. Some idea of the value of the work done by Mr. McCaldron and his two Assistants can be formed when it is mentioned that during the year they have inoculated over twenty-two thousand cattle in villages where 1,080 cattle had already died of rinderpest. Of the inoculated animals only 98 are reported to have subse- quently died. Some outbreaks of anthrax and hæmorrhagic septicæmia were also dealt with by inoculation, and large numbers of cattle were medically treated. Up to the end of 1907-08 Government had contributed Rs. 15,000 towards the cost of this special veterinary establishment, and grants were also made by the Local Boards of the Surma Valley. In recognition of the excellent results attained, Government has made a further grant of Rs. 10,000 for the year 1908-09. A statement of accounts has been furnished by the Secretary of the Surma Valley Branch of the Tea Association, which is enclosed herewith as Appendix B. 3. The year under report has been one of considerable development. Exclusive of the temporary establishment in the Surma Valley, the Department comprised at the commencement of the year one Inspector and eleven Assistants. At the end of the year the strength had increased to one Superintendent, two Inspectors and twenty-five Assistants. The permanent and temporary establishments combined have inoculated, some 64,000 animals, veterinary officers on tour have given medical treatment other than inoculation to over 35,000 animals and nearly 14,000 more have been treated in veterinary hospitals and dispensaries. 4. It is becoming recognised more and more that the most valuable work the Department can do is to throw the whole of its resources and energies into fighting outbreaks of rinderpest. From over 52,000 cattle inoculated for rinderpest during 1907-08 only 387 are known to have died. As it is not always possible to obtain accurate reports, we may assume that possibly 1,000 died. Now it is not unlikely that of the 52,000 not less than 13,000 would have died if they had not been inoculat- ed. The Department may therefore claim to have saved during the year some 12,000 cattle, the value of which at Rs. 30 per head would be Rs. 3,60,000 or more than six times the total expenditure of the Department on superintendence, subordinate estab- lishment, hospitals and dispensaries. 5. It will no doubt be the aim of the Superintendent to develope this side of the work. His chief difficulties are inadequacy of staff and the apathy of the people. It is known that in every district of the province large numbers of cattle are carried off every year by disease, but it is as yet only in the districts of the Assam and Surma Valleys, which have for a fairly long time had the benefit of competent veterinary assistance, that the people take the trouble to report when an outbreak of disease occurs. Instructions have already been issued to the police to report all outbreaks to
2 the nearest Veterinary Assistant. As these instructions do not seem to have had suffi- cient effect, I am now suggesting to District Officers that they should send a circular to panchayats instructing them when cattle disease breaks out in a village to imme- diately send information by post card or otherwise to the Veterinary Assistant. Fortunately, there is now scarcely any part of the province where the people object to having their cattle inoculated, and it is much to the credit of the Department that where its officers have been working for the longest time there they are most appreciated. 6. It is to be regretted that the returns of mortality from contagious diseases, contained in table II of the report, are very far from being reliable. They are based mainly on annual returns compiled by police officers and, as the forms are in English and contain no instructions for distinguishing the various diseases, it is not surprising to find that the figures returned have often but little relation to facts. I should like to support the recommendation made by Mr. Harris that quarterly returns should be submitted instead of annual return's. This would give an opportunity for the district Veterinary Assistant to check them by local enquiry, and if there has been heavy and previously unreported mortality from disease, to ascertain why his services were not requisitioned in due time. I have also asked the Superintendent to draft new forms, in which the names of contagious diseases will be given in vernacular, and supplemented by brief foot-notes describing the chief distinguishing symptoms of each. 7. Under the special instructions of Sir Lancelot Hare, two Veterinary Assistants have been employed since May 1907 in attending to the tonga ponies and cattle work- ing on the Shi Shillong-Gauhati cart road. This measure has greatly reduced the amount of disease among the ponies and diminished the suffering from wounds and galls. Now that the motor service is running more regularly, there will be less overworking of the ponies, and their general condition should improve still further. 8. Unfortunately, the strength of the Department can only expand at the rate of between twelve and twenty men a year, so it will be a long time before the sanctioned cadre is complete. Meantime, the Department has to make up in energy for what it lacks in numbers. Thanks to the excellence of the training imparted at Belgachia Veterinary College, we have every reason to be satisfied with the recruits who are joining the service. Mr. Harris is to be complimented on the energy and care with which his first year's work in the province has been performed and on the general zeal and ability of his subordinate staff. I have the honour to be, SIR, Tour most obedient Servant, S. G. HART, Director of Agriculture, Eastern Bengal and Assam.
REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, EASTERN BENGAL AND ASSAM, FOR THE YEAR 1907-1908. PREFACE2 7. During the year there were 14 Government stipendiaries from Assam attending the College. Of these, three failed in their examination at the end of the session. The stipendiaries were distributed in the various classes as follows : 3 12. Glanders.4 23. This year there were 36 outbreaks of anthrax in seven districts, where preven- tive inoculation was undertaken. Before inoculation 28 horses and 572 cattle died uninoculated. There were 105 equines and 9,521 bovines inoculated, of which 2 equines and 28 bovines subsequently died from the disease. Last year there were three outbreaks of disease in three districts in which 51 bovines died before inoculation, 181 bovines were inoculated, and no further deaths were reported. 24. Preventive inoculation against Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia was carried out in two districts. Before inoculation 56 cattle died. The number of cattle inoculated was 2,129, of which 11 subsequently died from the disease. In the previous year, there was one outbreak of disease in which inoculation was undertaken. Seven animals died before the operation, 376 were inoculated, and no further deaths were reported. 25. The total number of outbreaks of all diseases in which preventive inocula tion was undertaken during the year was 289, before inoculation 6,344 animals died. The total number of animals inoculated was 64,168, of which 428 subsequently died. In the previous year preventive inoculation was undertaken in 73 outbreaks, 2,806 animals died before inoculation, 18,865 animals were inoculated, of which 169 subsequertly died. 26. Table No. IV shows the number of animals treated by itinerating Veterinary Assistants during the year. They visited 4,146 villages and treated 35,354 animals : of these 18,137 animals were suffering from contagious diseases and 17,102 were treated for non-contagious diseases. Inoculated animals are not included in the number of animals treated. In the previous year 1,225 villages were visited and 10,932 were treated for contagius and non-contagious diseases. 27. The Veterinary Assistants at Shillong and Gauhati were especially placed there by Government with the view of improving the miserable condition of the tonga ponies on that road. The road is 63 miles long, and each Assistant inspected the stables and ponies on his half of the road. On the Shillong half there are eight stables, and these were inspected 24 times. The number of cases treated for lameness and harness galls was 187. From Surra 15 animals died or were destroyed, and two animals were destroyed for glanders. The Assistant treated 187 horses for non-contagious diseases and 23 for contagious diseases, chiefly mange. Three temporary sheds have been erected for the isolation of animals with contagious diseases. On the Gauhati half of the road there arc nine stables, and these were inspected 47 times. The number of animals treated for lameness and harness galls was 115. From Surra 32 animals died or were destroyed, and four animals were destroyed or died from glanders. All the cases of Surra, before destruction, were confirmed by microscopical examination. The Assistant treated 78 horses for non-contagious diseases and 42 horses for contagious diseases, chiefly mange or strangles. In addition to the actual treatment of disease, the Assistants have given attention to the quality and quantity of the food, the condition of the harness, brishes, etc., the method of shoeing and cleanliness of horses and. stables. A small supply of simple medicines has been placed at each stable, and the syces have been instructed how to apply or administer them. The tonga contractors were asked to give the number of deaths which occurred in previous years from contagious disease, but these figures are not obtainable. From enquiry, the mortality seems to be less than in former years, when the deaths were put down to anthrax. This year not a single case of anthrax amongst the tonga ponies has been found. VETERINARY HOSPITALS AND DISPENSARIES. 28. See Table V.5 patients. Last year, there were 647 in-patients and 6,231 out-patients. There is a decrease in the number of in-patients and an increase of 7,269 out-patients during the year under report. It is evident that these institutions are becoming increasingly popular, and that stock-owners are rapidly learning the value of veterinary aid. 29. Rangpur veterinary dispensary was opened on the 1st August 1907. The buildings, consisting of a cattle-shed, pharmacy, office, and assistant's quarters, are placed in a large compound near the bazar. The District Board constructed the dispensary at a cost of Rs. 7,500. A contribution of Rs. 4,000 was given by Srimati Bhobo Sundari Debya Chaudhurani in memory of her deceased husband, Babu Jogendra Narain Boy Chaudhury, Zamindar of Pirgacha. A commemoration tablet has been placed in the building. A good supply of instruments and drugs has been provided.. Previously the want of veterinary aid was greatly felt in this district. Since the opening of the dispensary good work has been accomplished, and its advantages are rapidly becoming known to animal owners in the district. Two hundred and forty-four animals have been treated, and the average daily attendance since the opening day has been 4.3. 30. The income and expenditure of veterinary hospitals and dispensaries are shown in table VI. The minus balance of Rs. 733 shown at Chittagong is only a temporary deficit, due to delay in the payment of the Municipal contribution. A deficit of Rs. 763 in last year's abstract was due to the same cause. The amount received from fees is Rs. 116-14-6, being an increase of Rs. 73-7-6 on the last year's fees. As most of the veterinary work is done in the free clinique and the people in the districts are generally poor, there can be no great increase in the amount of fees received. PART III.6 30 horses and 437 bovines against anthrax. The total is 7,155 animals inoculated. He inspected the tonga ponies on the Shillion-Gauhati road four times during outbreaks of surra or glanders. He visited 287 villages and treated 162 animals for contagious and 1,216 for non-contagious diseases. In addition he inspected the work of the assistants in the Assam Valley and attended the live-stock show at Jorhat. 36. Veterinary Inspector G. P. Sen was promoted to the Inspectorship on the 22nd February 1908. Most of his time has been employed at headquarters in the inspection of the Municipal cattle, inspection work under the Glanders and Farcy Act, inspection of dispensaries and in supervising the receipt and despatch of all sera to various parts of the province. He has travelled 682 miles by rail, 90 miles by road, and 528 miles by steamer and country boat. He inoculated 18 cattle against rinderpest and treated 205 for non-contagious diseases. 37. The majority of the Veterinary Assistants have shown considerable interest in their professional work, and their energy and zeal are slowly gaining the confidence of all classes. 38. The office work has been carried out in a temporary hut throughout the entire year. The routine has been entirely new, but the staff have shown considerable interest in the work, in overcoming many of the difficulties and in grasping the details. TABLES X7 TABLE I.

REPORT OF THE VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, SURMA VALLEY BRANCH, INDIAN TEA ASSOCIATION, FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH 1908. PREFACE16 GENERAL REMARKS. 13. The controlling of contagious diseases largely depends upon the prompt notification of out- breaks. This department could never employ a staff of assistants such as would be required to eusure a correct report from all districts. Invaluable assistance has, however, been rendered by the planters. Not only have they proved useful in many ways, but they have been instrumental in dealing with the movement of stocks, the quarantining of infected animals, without which the whole system of contending against contagious disease would have broken down, and the Surma Valley would have been in a very different condition as regards disease than it now is, but they have been very useful in reporting disease and lending a hand. The police have also been very useful in reporting the outbreaks of disease, but I am afraid in some cases their reports arrived too late: the usefulness of the village force in this direction would be greatly increased if their post card reports were forwarded on at once by the officer in charge of police stations and outposts. ' The Advisory and Working Committee have rendered invaluable assistance in many ways. They have brought the Department directly and intimately into touch with the leading raiyats of the different districts ; with the result that I have acquired a better knowledge of local conditions and of the most practical and least inconvenient way of dealing with, and ascer- taining the cause of the diseases in this valley. At first I found most of the villagers, to whom belonged most of the live stock, very superstitious, and strongly adverse to accepting advice, unless it is from one they know, and who has some influence over them. It is the difficulty in getting the raiyats to consent to have their cattle inoculated and treated at once that the different diseases spread so rapidly. I am glad, however, to say that with a little tact and inducement they will allow their cattle to be inoculated. Although the principal duties of this department are to deal with the infectious diseases of stock, and to conduct investigations into the nature, cause, and prevention of the numerous diseases which are indigenous to this valley, there has been a continuously growing demand for the treat- ment of common diseases of stock ; this, I am glad to say, shows that the agricultural population is beginning to appreciate the value of scientific treatment. I try to meet the demands of the raiyats and others as far as possible, consistent with the discharge of the more pressing and important duties of attending to outbreaks of infectious diseases, and readily admit that it is very desirable that the raiyats should be able to obtain veterinary advice and assistance when their cattle become sick. With the small fund and the limited number of Veterinary Assistants at my disposal, I am afraid that such assistance cannot be given in as satisfactory a manner as I should like. It is pleasing to be able to report that not only have our efforts to cope with the ordinary contagious diseases been attended with a considerable amount of success, but the way in which a good understanding has been established between the villagers and the department is very gratifying. The bacteriological investigations which have been conducted by me (which I am sorry to say cannot be pushed forward for want of funds), and the improvement in the breed of cattle, will be dealt with in the paper which it is my intention to publish shortly. When we think of the way our work was handicapped in the beginning, it is sur- prising that the total work of the year shows such good results, but by the courteous and kindly encouragement received from the Inspector General, Civil Veterinary Department, and others, we were encouraged to push on with the work. Mr. A. J. G. Cress well, Secretary, Surma Valley Branch, Indian Tea Association, has rendered most valuable assistance in the very prompt manner he has for- warded on all correspondence, and made himself generally useful. I cannot too highly express my appreciation to Mr. W. Harris, Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Eastern Bengal and Assam, for the unremitting attention he has given to my indents for serum. My thanks are due to Mr. D. Ferguson for kindly placing a cool pit at my disposal in which to keep serum. The Veterinary Assistants have worked very well during the year. W. H.

SCOTT, ESQ., I.C.S., OFFG. DIRECTOR, DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, EASTERN BENGAL AND ASSAM, To THE CHIEF SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF EASTERN BENGAL AND ASSAM. THE CHIEF SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF Dated Shillong, the 1st July 1909. SIR, I HAVE the honour to forward the Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary- Department, Eastern Bengal and Assam, for the year ending the 31st March 1909, together with a report by Mr. McCaldron, the Special Veterinary Officer employed under the Surma Valley Branch of the Tea Association. 2. During the year Mr. McCaldron and his staff continued to do good work in the Surma Valley in combating the rinderpest and other forms of cattle-disease. It is clear from Mr. McCaldron's report, which is enclosed as Appendix A, that the virulence of the epidemic of cattle-disease in the Surma Valley has now consider- ably abated. Up to the end of 1908-09, Government had contributed Rs. 25,000 towards the maintenance of this special staff, and in view of the excellent results obtained, a further grant of Rs. 6,000 has been made for the year 1909-10. The total expenditure of this establishment will be found in Appendix B. 3. It is satisfactory to note that the students from Eastern Bengal and Assam acquitted themselves with great credit at the final examination of the Belgachia College held in March 1909. Out of 25 students that graduated from the College, there were 13 from this province securing first two places and 6 out of the first 10, of whom three were Assamese Muhammadans. It has been arranged that in future the third-year students will be taught the theory and practice of inoculation work at the Belgachia College. This will avoid the delay and expense now involved in training the Assistants either at Bareilly or Muktesar. 4. Vernacular editions of the four veterinary leaflets referred to in paragraph 11 of the report are just ready and arrangement is being made to secure their widest possible publication among the cultivators and cattle owners in several districts. Leaflets Nos. 3 and 4 are the most important of the series and the ones most likely to attract the attention of raiyats and to lead to useful results. 5. During the year rinderpest was more or less prevalent throughout the entire province and is reported to have accounted for 44,123 deaths as against 32,823 last year. The disease took its most severe form in Bakarganj and caused a total reported mortality of 8,132 cattle. It is gratifying to observe that raiyata are beginning to appreciate the utility of inoculation which was carried out on a fairly large scale in 27 districts or subdivi- sions, against 22 in the preceding year. The number of inoculations for rinderpest made by the permanent establishment increased from 30,1S2 to 43,011. 6. With a view to securing prompt reports on the outbreaks of cattle-disease, a proposal is now under the consideration of Government to supplement the work of the police as a reporting agency by the employment of peripatetic officers of: Excise and Education Departments, Managers of Wards' estates, Kanungos, mandals, etc., for the purpose. 7. The condition of tonga ponies on the Shillong-Gauhati road has not improved much. It is recently reported by the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, that the rule prescribing the minimum number of serviceable ponies to be main- tained is not observed; and the ponies are underfed, and instructions and warnings of Veterinary Officers are not attended to by the contractors' men. I have asked the Public Works Department to take necessary steps on the matter.
2 8. With the object of improving the local breed of sheep in the Khasi Hills, chiefly for wool, an experiment on a small scale on the rearing of sheep has been undertaken at the close of the year. At present there is a small flock in the Upper Shillong Agricultural Station comprising a Dumba ram, the free gift of a European gentleman, 5 local ewes and 4 lambs (not the progeny of the Dumba). I am also in communication with the Agricultural Department, Madras, regard- ing the possibility of introduction of sheep from thence. 9. It remains to add that the report of the Superintendent affords ample proof of commendable progress and development throughout the province and that Mr. Harris and his subordinates deserve great credit for the zeal and ability with which, they continued to discharge their duties towards the Department. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient Servant, J. E. SCOTT, offg. Director of Agriculture, Eastern Bengal and, Assam. EnclosuresREPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, EASTERN BENGAL AND ASSAM, FOR THE YEAR 1908-09. PREFACE2 first tea in the final year and gained the foremost prizes. The Government stipendiaries were distributed in the various classes as follows :3 These have been translated into Bengali, Assamese and Khasi. Being in pamphlet form they are more easily distributed and more likely to be read by the villagers. They are also intended to assist thana officers in differentiating the various diseases and so lead to more accurate reporting of outbreaks. PART II.4 21. Blackquarter.5 appreciated by villagers who came in from considerable distances for supplies. Inoculated animals are not included in the number of animals treated for contagious disease. 31. Two Government Veterinary Assistants were again placed on the Gauhati- Shillong tonga line. The ponies on the road are liable to be very much neglected The syces are usually hillmen who continually persist in working ponies, no matter how badly galled. It is very difficult to get this class of men to take any care of their horses or even to obey instructions. On the Shillong half of the road there were 8 stables and these were visited 43 times. Twenty-one cases were treated for lameness, 161 for harnessgalls and 90 for other non-contagious disease. Pour cases of glanders were detected and destroyed and 23 cases of surra died or were destroyed. In addition 30 horses were treated for other contagions diseases. There was an out- break of mange amongst the ponies, but by the prompt action of the Veterinary Assistant, in attending to the thorough disinfection of harness, brushes, stables, etc., besides isolating and treating infected animals, the disease was quickly eradicated. 32. On the Gauhati half of the road 25 cases of surra were detected during the year. There were no cases of glanders. During the year 114 animals were treated for lameness, saddlegalls, etc. VETERINARY HOSPITALS AND DISPENSARIES. 33. Table No. V shows the number of animals treated at hospitals and dispen- saries during the year. At dispensaries only out-door patients are treated, as there is no accommodation for in-patients. No new hospitals have been added this year, but a small dispensary room has been opened at Pabna, and at Barisal the dispensary has been re-opened. A temporary Government dispensary has been opened in Dacca where both the Municipal and the ordinary work is attended to. Sites have been chosen for Veterinary Hospitals in Dacca, Shillong, Gauhati and Jorhat, but owing to insufficient funds, building operations have not been started. The dispensary at Goalpara has been closed for eleven months. On the 31st March there were seven Veterinary Hospitals and seven Veterinary dispensaries. The total number of in-patients and out-patients treated during the year was 106 horses, 409 bullocks and 31 others as in-patients and 8,039 horses, 9,443 bullocks and 2,362 others as out-patients, making a total of 546 in-patients and 14,844 out-patients. In the previous year 405 in-patients and 13,500 out-patients were treated. 34. The income and expenditure of Veterinary hospitals and dispensaries is shown in Table VI. The amount received from fees is Rs. 288-8-11, being an increase of Rs. 71-10-5 on last year's receipts. The total expenditure under the various heads has increased from Rs. 12,695 to Rs. 19,589. PART III.6 PART IV 7 PART V.8 for cattle sheds. Municipal cattle and sheds should, I consider, be a good example of how animals ought to be cared for and treated. In places where there are Veterinary Assistants, these animals are treated, but they are still under-fed, and cruelly beaten, and so far comparatively little progress has been made. 52. It has been decided to send the two Inspectors of the Department to Belga- chia College for a post-graduate course, so that they will be able to do simple microscopical diagnosis and be more expert in investigating and reporting accurately outbreaks of special diseases, etc. 53. During the year no observations and investigations in the field in regard to the spread of surra, glanders, and other contagious diseases have been possible, nor has it been possible to commence a cattle survey of the province, because, with the limited staff, the work which has been most urgent, has taken up all our time. The Department is still severely handicapped for office and laboratory accommodation, and nothing but the simplest microscopicial work has been done, and that in my own quarters. 54. The services of the local Veterinary Assistants should be utilised in checking all the Tables, but especially Table No. II which shows the mortality from contagious diseases. If this was done, it would save time and obviate corresponding with Local Bodies on what are undoubtedly inaccuracies. W. HARRIS, Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Eastern Bengal and Assam.

No. 31Resolution on the Report of the Administration of the Veteri- nary Department, Eastern Bengal and Assam, in the year 1908-09. Extract from the Proceedings of the Lieutenant-Governor of Eastern Bengal and Assam in the Revenue Department, No. 2547 R., dated the 16th September 1909. READ2 is open to question whether an increase in the number of, and expenditure on, dispensaries is sound policy. The chief usefulness of the service at present lies in the work done by assistants itinerating in villages and anything which tends to diminish the amount of touring done by them is likely to impair their general usefulness. Except in large towns and municipalities, the proportion of the population who can derive benefit from a dispensary situated in the town is necessarily small. Some trouble has been experienced in Dacca, owing to the fact that the Veterinary Assist- ant in charge has not had time to spare from the work required of him by the Municipality. But this is only a temporary inconvenience, as it is intended, as soon as a qualified man is available, to employ a Special Assistant for Municipal and dispensary work alone. The Lieutenant-Governor notices with regret the remarks made by the Superintendent as to the condition of Municipal cattle in general, and trusts that Chairmen of Municipalities will do their utmost to remedy this discreditable defect. Expert supervision is not required to secure mere clean- liness and ordinary consideration, but it is feared that in the case of many Munici- palities no supervision is exercised at all. 5. The thanks of Government are due to Mr. Hart for the continued interest and energy he has shown in furthering the efficiency of the Veterinary Service and to Mr. Harris for the practical outcome of his control of the working of the Department as shown in his most interesting report.

No. 8123G. FROM F. W. STRONG, ESQ., I.C.S., OFFG. DIRECTOR, DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, EASTERN BENGAL AND ASSAM, TO THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF EA8TERN BENGAL AND ASSAM, REVENUE AND GENERAL DEPARTMENT. Dated Shillong, the 8th/9th July 1910. SIR, I HAVE the honour to forward the Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Eastern Bengal and Assam, for the year ending the 31st March 1910. I have little to add to the full and comprehensive report submitted by Mr. Harris. 2. The arrangement made in 1907 for the conduct of Veterinary work in the Surma Valley by a special staff working under Mr. McCaldron and subject to the general control of the Surma Valley Branch of the Tea Association continued till the death of Mr. McCaldron in November 1909. The Secretary of the Association then took over the management of the Veterinary staff but made it over to the Chairmen of the Local Boards concerned in December 1909 who held it till the close of the year under report. A report on the work done in the Surma Valley and a statement of account as furnished by the Secretary of the Surma Valley Branch of the Tea Association are submitted herewith. It is now proposed that the annual contribution hitherto paid by Government towards the maintenance of the special staff should be discontinued and the districts of Sylhet and Cachar be brought under the direct control of the Civil Veterinary Department in common with the rest of the province. Government Veterinary Assistants have already been posted there under the Local Boards, and an Inspector and a staff assistant have also been deputed to work there. 3. The report shows that contagious diseases were considerably less prevalent than in the preceding year. It is true that no great accuracy can be claimed for the figures, but the decrease of over 15,000 as compared with 1908-1909 in the reported deaths from rinderpest proves that this disease has diminished greatly in virulence. The natural result is a proportionate fall in the number of anti-rinderpest inoculations performed by the Veterinary Assistants. This decrease in inoculations is also partly due to the inadequate supply of serum available and to fewer animals having been inoculated by the special staff employed in the Surma Valley. 4. It is gratifying to observe that the number of cases treated by Veterinary Assistants on tour rose from 64,012 to 73,629. During the past year there has been some improvement in the condition of Tonga ponies on the Shillong-Gauhati road. The revision of the rate of fixed travelling allowance of the itinerating Veterinary Assistants referred to in paragraph 61 of the Report was sanctioned by Government at the close of the year. 5. The number of cases treated at Hospitals and Dispensaries rose from 15,390 in 1908-1909 to 16,341 in the year under report. This is satisfactory as indicating the growing popularity of these institutions. 6. Owing to lack of funds no progress has hitherto been made in the erection of the Government Dispensaries and Hospitals, which it is proposed to build at several stations. Also nothing has yet been done in the matter of providing suitable accommodation for the Veterinary Department in Dacca. It is proposed to take up during the current year the construction of Dispensary buildings in Dacca and Silchar.
2 7. A sheep breeding experiment which was started in February 1909 at the Upper Shillong Farm with a Dumba ram, the free gift of a European gentleman, 5 local ewes and 4 lambs (not the progeny of the Dumba), was continued during the year. At its close the flock comprised 17 animals, including 10 half-bred Dumba ram and ewe lambs. These show a great improvement on the local breed of sheep. In reply to an enquiry made last year as to the possibility of introducing sheep from Madras, the Director of Agriculture, Madras, has intimated that there is no breed of sheep in Madras likely to succeed in the Khasi Hills. During the current year efforts will be made to obtain another Dumba ram and some better ewes from Behar or Bhutan as the local ewes are very inferior animals to breed from. 8. In conclusion, I beg to say that the ability and energy displayed by Mr. Harris in the management of the Department merit commendation. I also endorse with satisfaction Mr. Harris' remarks on the good work done by the Veterinary Assistants named in paragraph 53 of his report. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient Servant, F. W. STRONG, Offg. Director of Agriculture, Eastern Bengal and Assam.
REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERNARY DEPARTMENT, EASTERN BENGAL AND ASSAM, 1909-1910. PREFACE2 9. In the first year class one student was maintained partly by Government and partly by the Anjuman-i-Islamia Association Sylhet. The progress of the student, inspite of repeated warnings, was unsatisfactory, and as he failed to pass the preli- minary test examination, his name was struck off before the end of the year. The Anjuman-i-Islamia was unable to secure any substitute to take his place. 10. There were 23 District and Local Board stipendiaries attending the college, distributed in the classes as below:3 18. Anthrax.4 The total number of deaths from bovine contagious diseases returned during the year is 50,276 from 25 districts. Last year 23 districts reported 85,476 deaths. PREVENTIVE INOCULATION. 28. During the year there were 376 outbreaks of rinderpest in which inoculation by the serum alone method was performed. Inoculation was undertaken in 35 districts and subdivisions. In these outbreaks 8,096 animals died uninoculated and 38,153 bovines and 83 others were inoculated. There were 339 deaths reported amongst the inoculated. In the previous year inoculation was carried out in 27 districts and sub- divisions, there were 359 outbreaks of rinderpest in which 7,794 animals died, and 50,194 bovines and 10 others were inoculated, of which 444 subsequently died. There is thus a reduction of 11,968 in the number of inoculations during the year as compared with the previous year. This reduction is due to several causes, such as reduced number of inoculations by the special Veterinary staff in the Surma Valley and diminution in the general prevalence of disease, but chiefly because during three months in the year serum was not available and no inoculation was undertaken. During the remainder of the time the Assistants were informed that the supply was limited and they were instructed to inoculate only the valuable and young animals and those fit for work. This matter is referred to in the general remarks. 29. The largest number of inoculations were done during the year in the districts of Sylhet, Bakarganj, Jalpaiguri, Dhubri and Tezpur. In the previous year the districts of Jalpaiguri, Sibsagar, Sylhet, Bakarganj, Cachar, Dhubri and Tezpur showed the greatest number of inoculations. Staff Veterinary Assistants were deputed from headquarters to Bakarganj, Jalpaiguri, Darrang and Nowgong to assist the local men in combating the disease. 30. There were 22 outbreaks of Anthrax in 10 subdivisions in which 13 horses, 175 bovines and one elephant died before inoculation. In 17 outbreaks the disease was definitely diagnosed by microscopical examination. In two outbreaks the disease occurred where it had been previously diagnosed and in three outbreaks it was not diagnosed microscopically. In these outbreaks 302 horses and 3,203 bovines were inoculated, and one horse and two bovines were reported as having died from the disease afterwards, but this was not definitely confirmed. The number of suspected outbreaks which proved negative after examination was 28, of which five came from Cachar, seven from Sylhet, two from Gauhati, three from Nowgong and 11 from Sibsagar. In the previous year there were 37 outbreaks in which seven horses and 320 bovines died and 234 horses and 7,126 bovines were inoculated. The outbreaks during the year under report are diminished by 15, and the total number of deaths and number of inoculations are also reduced. This may be due in part to the fact that the disease was less prevalent, but more care has been taken to diagnose microscopically every suspected case and inoculations have not been undertaken until the disease was confirmed and thus a considerable number of cases formerly included have been eliminated. 31. No inoculation was undertaken for Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia during the year. 32. The total number of outbreaks in which inoculation was undertaken was 398, in which 8,255 animals died before inoculation. The tolal number of animals inocu- lated was 41,747, of which 342 subsequently died. In the previous year the number of outbreaks was 397 and 8,214 animals died before inoculation; the total number of inoculation was 58,002, of which 480 subsequently died. 33. Table IV shows the work of the itinerant Veterinary Assistants during the year. They visited 6,662 villages and treated 73,629 animals. Of these 32,909 were suffering from contagious diseases and 40,544 were treated for non-contagious diseases. In the previous year 6,382 villages were visited, 40,476 animals were treated for contagious diseases and 23,270 were treated for non-contagious diseases. These figures indicate that contagious disease was not so prevalent during the year under report as in the previous year as there is a decrease of 7,567 animals treated for contagious diseases; on the other hand, there is an increase of 17,274 animals treated for non-contagious diseases. 34. Two Government Veterinary Assistants were again placed on the Gauhati- Shillong tonga line. During the past year there has been some improvement in the condition of the working ponies. The animals have also been better cared for. One case of glanders and twenty-two cases of surra were found; these either died in isolation sheds or were destroyed. In the previous year 4 cases of glanders and 48 cases of surra were detected.
5 On the Shillong half of the road there are eight stables to which 448 visits were paid- One thousand and sixty cases were treated for contagious and non-contagious diseases, of which 59 were for mange, one for glanders, 20 for surra, 211 were cases of lameness, 517 cases of harness galls and 252 for other diseases. On the Gauhati half of the road 479 visits were paid to stables. The total number of cases treated was 692, of which 2 were for surra, 58 were for mange, 72 for lameness, 296 for harness galls and 264 for other diseases. VETERINARY HOSPITALS AND DISPENSARIES. 35. Table V shows the number of hospitals and dispensaries during the year under report. There has been no addition to their number. The total number of in and out-patients treated during the year was 2,887 equines, 10,839 bovines and 2,615 others. In the previous year 3,145 equines, 9,852 bovines and 2,393 others were treated as in and out-patients. The following is a brief review of the work done in the various dispensaries. 36. Dacca Government Dispensary.6 41. Dinaipur.7 in column 11 of Table VI, a sum of Rs. 600-9-6 was also spent towards the supply of instruments to Local Board Assistants and debited to Government. 50. Table No. VII shows the total strength of the subordinate veterinary staff as it stood on the 31st March 1910. During the year two men, who were tempo- rarily employed by Local Boards, were discharged as their services were no longer required. Eleven men joined the Department direct from College and one man, after his case had been carefully considered, was allowed to rejoin, after resigning his appointment and being absent for about 9 months. These Assistants were posted at Kishorganj, Madaripur, Comilla, Jalpaiguri, Hailakandi, North Sylhet, Goalpara, Tezpur, Mangaldai, Nowgong and Golaghat. 61. The duties of an Inspector consist in checking the work of the Assistants, visiting seats of outbreaks, diagnosing disease, enquiring into the results of inoculation, etc. He is also expected to know the particulars of the various breeds of cattle and to take an interest in all questions relating to the welfare of horses and cattle. He is also an Inspector under the Glanders and Farcy Act. Veterinary Inspector S. Mukherjee remained in charge of the Assistants in the Assam Valley with his headquarters at Jorhat. He was sent to Bengal Veterinary College for three months' training in the Post Graduate class. He was on tour for 133 days and travelled 5,101 miles by rail, 1,038 miles by road and 779 miles by steamer and country boat. He visited 81 villages and treated 228 animals for contagious disease and 516 for non-contagious disease. He inspected the dispensaries at Dibrugarh, North Lakhimpur, Sibsagar, Mariani, Golaghat, Shillong, Mangaldai and Nowgong. He also inspected the ponies on the tonga road and the cattle at the Government Farms of Shillong and Jorhat. The Staff Veterinary Assistant (P. C. Sirkar), who remained in charge of the office of the Inspector during his absence, was on tour for 47 days and travelled 901 miles by rail, 713 miles by road and 120 miles by steamer. He treated 207 cases for contagious and non-contagious diseases, and inspected the dispensaries at Sibsagar, Mariani, Gauhati, Barpeta, Tezpur and Now- gong. In the previous year the Inspector was on tour for 192 days and travelled 5,630 miles by rail, 78G miles by steamer and country boat and 1,028 miles by road. During the year 15 Assistants were under his supervision. 52. Veterinary Inspector G. P. Sen was placed in charge of the Assistants in Eastern Bengal and Surma Valley, and had his headquarters at Dacca. He was sent to the Bengal Veterinary College for 3 months' training in the Post Graduate class where he showed considerable ability and was creditably reported upon by the Principal. He was on tour for 116 days and travelled 5,271 miles by rail, 525 miles by road and 1,496 miles by steamer. He visited 79 villages in his enquiry into the results of inoculation, etc. He inspected the Assistants of Mymensingh, Faridpur, Malda, Rajshahi, Rangpur, Dacca and Comilla twice during the year, and those at Pabna, Noakhali, Chittagong, Barisal, Madaripur, Kishorganj, Bogra and Dinajpur once. During the year he had 29 assistants under his supervision. He assisted in the purchase of cattle at Sonepur, inspected the cattle on Government Farm, Dacca, and visited outbreaks of Glanders in his jurisdiction. During his stay at headquarters he works under my guidance in the laboratory and supervises the distribution of serum, etc. During the deputation period of Mr. G. P. Sen, Staff Veterinary Assistant M. S. Chaudhuri remained in charge of the office of the Inspector, Eastern Bengal, and inspected the work of the Veterinary Assistants in his circle. 53. The Veterinary Assistants who have taken a keen and intelligent interest in their profession and who have been specially successful in their work are the following:8 limited owing to the limited supply of serum. At headquarters they visited the Gowkhanas regularly, inspected gariwallas' stables, checked the receipt and despatch of serum, etc. Two of them also acted for the Inspectors when the latter were at the Post Graduate class. PART III.9 GENERAL REMARKS 59. The supply of Rinderpest serum during the year has not been sufficient to meet the demands of this province. The supply was cut off entirely for three months and at other times indents were cut down. The utility of the Department was con- sequently greatly handicapped. Serum is supplied from the Imperial Laboratory at Muktesar. Year by year as the advantages of inoculation become known the demand becomes greater. In several places where two years ago there was opposi- tion to inoculation, this year urgent requests were made to send inoculators as soon as disease appeared. As the staff of the Department increases in number, more serum will be required each year. It is most important that in future the supply of serum should equal the demand. Fortunately Rinderpest was not so prevalent during the year under review as formerly. If it had been, no more serum would have been available. The laboratory supplied, 60,000 doses of Rinderpest serum during the year. In the previous year 77,000 doses were supplied. 60. During the year no buildings have been erected for the Department, due generally to want of funds. The lack of suitable accommodation has been felt at headquarters where an office, laboratory and dispensary buildings are wanted, at Shillong where a Hospital is required and at Jorhat where a dispensary and Inspector's office are wanted. It is hoped that some of these will be completed within the next year. 61. The fixed travelling allowance Rs. 15 per month has proved insufficient as an Assistant cannot remain on tours 15 days in the month; if he is required to stay out longer he does so at a loss. This also forms an excuse for neglecting work. A revised scheme has therefore been drafted and is at present under the consideration of Government. 62. As several enquiries have lately been made regarding suitable nalbunds I repeat what was said last year. Sufficiently qualified nalbunds are very difficult to get, but a young nalbund could be sent for instruction, by any Polo Club or District Board, to the Bengal Veterinary College where there is a good forge and two well- trained men. He would learn how to make a good shoe, to prepare the foot, how to fit the shoe when hot, etc. The College fees for a course of training is Rs. 20. The district sending him would have to pay his wages. The length of the course depends on the capabilities of the man, and would last for 3 to 6 months. 63. The method of reporting the mortality from the various diseases leaves much to be desired. If this information was reported every quarter by the thana officers to the Magistrate there would be less time lost in supplying these tables at the end of the year and opportunity would be given in time to verify these reports by sending out the Veterinary Assistant. During the year under report outbreaks of contagious disease were reported in the annual figures from places which never reported it during the year. 64. The question of improving the local breed of cattle has been discussed. In many districts breeding is impossible because the whole place is a swamp for a great part of the year. In many more there is no good land reserved for grazing and the ryot does not store up provender for his cattle in times of scarcity. At present the young stock are bred from weak, emaciated or immature cows. The calves do not get sufficient milk; later they get as food, coarse, indigestible straw or grass which is often limited in quantity; another fault is that they are put to work too early. The placing of good bulls in districts will not of itself permanently improve the breed till the ryot has learned to supply suitable food, to take more care of his young stock, to value the castration of all the weedy bulls and also to select the cows for breeding purposes as well as the bull. 65. There is still evidence that a considerable number of cattle are deliberately poisoned for the sake of their hides. If the hides of poisoned cattle were slashed and rendered useless, this practice of poisoning cattle might be abandoned. 66. The condition of cattle, sheep and goats going to slaughter houses is worthy of attention, as emaciated, diseased animals are seen which under no circumstances should possibly be fit for food. Flesh and organs are sometimes exposed for sale which are diseased or unwholesome, and from their condition could convey disease to man. In places where larger municipalities employ Veterinary Assistants the inspection of animals before and after slaughter might be made a part of their duties.
10 67. The office work is still increasing. During the year 5,055 letters were received against 3,438 in the previous year. The office staff has worked very creditably during the year and has promptly attended to all urgent matters. W. HARRIS, Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Eastern Bengal and Assam.

READ 2 assistants should go out to search for patients and press their services upon the- villagers instead of waiting passively for animals to he brought to them. The rates of travelling allowances for itinerant officers have now been revised within the limits, sanctioned by the Government of India with a view to encourage touring and penalise inactivity, and the Superintendent should note the results of this measure in his next report. 5. The improvement of the breed of cattle is a question which is at present engaging the attention of the Local Government, but there are many difficulties to be overcome. The indigenous stock is poor, the supply of fodder is often unsuitable and deficient, immature and weakly bulls are allowed to cover the herd and no attempt is made to select the best cows for breeding. During the year there was some increase in the number of stud bulls maintained from public funds, but their number is still so small that they can have little practical effect. The reservation of grazing grounds in localities where it is still possible to do so is now under consideration- and a scheme has been put forward for the establishment of herds of good stock in suitable localities but no real improvement will he possible unless the co-operation of the cultivators is obtained and some attempt is made to breed only from the best strains and to supply the young stock with sufficient nourishment. The Lieutenant-Governor is glad to learn that attempts are being made to improve the breed of sheep in the Khasi Hills by the introduction of the dumba strain. 6. The thanks of Government are due to Mr. Harris for the zeal and ability displayed in the administration of his Department throughout the year and to Mr. Strong for the intelligent supervision exercised by him. ORDERED that a copy of this Resolution be published in the Government Gazette for general information. ORDERED also that a copy of this Resolution be forwarded to the Director of Agriculture, Eastern Bengal and Assam, for information. By order, etc., B. C. ALLEN, Offg.

No. 6743G. FROM S. G. HART, ESQ., I.C.S., DIRECTOR, DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, EASTERN BENGAL AND ASSAM, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF EASTERN BENGAL AND ASSAM, REVENUE AND GENERAL DEPARTMENT. Dacca, the 1st July 1911. SIR, I HAVE the honour to forward the report of the Veterinary Department for the year 1910-11. The strength of the Department increased during the year from 2 Veterinary Inspectors and 44 Assistants to 4 Inspectors and 51 Assistants. 2. The amount of work done shows a corresponding increase. Itinerant Assistants visited nearly 10,000 villages and treated 90,101 animals, as compared with 73,629 animals in the preceding year. Dispensary Assistants treated 16,452 new cases during the year; this number excludes cases in which advice only was given or in which the Assistant had to prescribe without seeing the affected animals and though the number of cases returned for 1909-10 was nearly as large, the figures for 1910-11 represent a greater amount of work because the returns have been more carefully compiled. There are definite indications that the Department is acquiring greater control over the diseases of animals in this Province; for the increase in the number of cases treated has been accompanied by a further decline in the prevalence of contagious diseases, as is shown by the returns of deaths from disease and of the cases of contagious disease brought for treatment. Very little approximation to accuracy can be claimed for the returns of mortality which are merely compiled by police officers from the reports of village chaukidars. If the returns were compiled quarterly instead of annually and checked by Veterinary Assistants, their accuracy could certainly be incrcased; but the Assistants are probably better employed in cheeking disease than in scrutinising statistics. 3. A very serious situation has arisen in regard to the supply of serum. The Bacteriological Laboratory at Muktesar is no longer able to meet all the requirements of this Province and the Superintendent has found great difficulty in obtaining the serum necessary for dealing with some outbreaks of rinderpest, anthrax, and hæmor- rhagic septicæmia. Similar difficulties are occurring in other Provinces, and I venture to submit that it is time that the situation should be faced and a strong representation addressed to the Government of India respectfully urging the immediate establishment of another laboratory, in addition to Muktesar, for the supply of sera. In order to check wastage, the Government of India has decided to charge the Local Governments for all the sera supplied to each Province, leaving the Local Government to exercise its discretion as to recovery of the cost from private persons or local bodies. The Government of this Province has decided that no fee should be levied from ordinary cattle owners for inoculating their animals, and that for the present local bodies will also not be called on to bear this expense. 4. By increasing the number of Inspectors the Superintendent has undoubtedly gained a more effective control over the Assistants of his Department. These young men in the early days of their service are greatly in need of advice and direction from more experienced officers, and though most of our Assistants have quickly developed into active and useful men, there are some who, in spite of good records at College, prove unsuited for district work. For the sake of the Department and of the public such men should be weeded out as quickly as possible.
2 5. This Province has reason to be gratified with the results of the final examina- tions of 1911 of the Belgachia Veterinary College. The first student in order of merit in the whole College is a Muhammadan of Sylhet, the 5th and 13th are Muhammadans of the Assam Valley. Out of the 35 students in the list 15 come from this Pro- vince. Another very satisfactory point is that during the past year there were no less than 27 private students from Eastern Bengal and Assam in the College. 6. The most urgent need of the Department at present is adequate accommodation for the headquarters at Dacca, and particularly for a laboratory and hospital. Several suitable sites have been chosen, but ultimately found to be unavailable, and I regret to say that the difficulty still remains. The construction of a hospital at Silchar is being commenced and a site has been acquired for a hospital at Shillong. A considerable portion of the progress achieved and the satisfactory work done by the officers of the Veterinary Department is due to the activity and capacity of Mr. Harris. I feel bound also to add my commendation to that of the Superintendent for the excellent work done by Veterinary Assistants S. Ghosh at Dacca and P. Mukherji at Shillong. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient Servant, S. G. HART, Director, Department of Agriculture, Eastern Bengal and Assam.
REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, EASTERN BENGAL AND ASSAM, FOR THE YEAR 1910-1911. PREFACE.2 There were 30 District and Local Board stipend aries attending the College, dis- tributed in the various classes as below:3 EQUINES. 14. Glanders.4 24. Black quarter.5 and 73,629 animals were treated, of which 32,909 animals were treated for contagious diseases and 40,544 for non-contagious diseases. There is again a decrease of 2,138 animals treated for contagions diseases and an increase of 8,658 animals treated for non-contagious diseases. This indicates that the prevalence of contagions disease has been gradually diminishing. 35. Two Government Veterinary Assistants were placed on the Gauhati-Shillong Tonga line. The condition of the ponies, generally speaking, improved and the animals were better cared for. On the Shillong half of the road there are eight stables which were inspected 49 times. The total number of animals treated on the line was 638, of which 163 were treated for contagious diseases and 475 for non-contagious diseases: of the latter 82 animals were treated for lameness, 211 for harness galls and 1S2 for other diseases. Thirteen animals died or were destroyed for surra. There was a small outbreak of mange during the year. 36. On the Gauhati half of the road there are nine stables which were inspected 40 times. The Assistant treated nine horses for contagious diseases and 342 horses for non-contagious diseases. Seven animals died or were destroyed for surra. VETERINARY HOSPITALS AND DISPENSARIES. 37. Table No. V shows the work accomplished in hospitals and dispensaries. There were in all 16 veterinary dispensaries at the close of the year under report against 14 in the previous year. Two new hospitals have been added during the year, one at Silchar, where a temporary building has been erected, and the other at Narayanganj for the treatment of Municipal bullocks. 38. The total number of animals treated as in- and out-patients during the year was 3,156 Equines, 10,581 bovines, and 2,715 others. In the previous year 2,887 equines, 10,839 bovines, and 2,615 others were treated as in- and out-patients. The figures given represent the actual number of new cases treated during the year and exclude old cases and those for which advice was given only. 39. Dacca Government Dispensary.6 43. Tippera Veterinary Hospital.7 53. Gauhati Government Dispensary.8 59. During the year there were four Staff Veterinary Assistants and one Reserve Assistant under the direct supervision of the Superintendent, and they were continually employed during the year. The duties of these men are to relieve temporarily the district Veterinary Assistants proceeding on leave and to supplement them when serious outbreaks of cattle disease occur. They were deputed to the following districts and subdivisions:9 bullocks present at Jamalpur and Bogra fairs, but the fees realised show a considerable decrease, and no reasons have been offered for the same. The fairs at North Sylhet and Malda are reported to have been successful. The local authorities have taken a great interest in. the matter. The Deputy Commissioner of Sylhet remarks that the shows are helping to arouse some interest in the breeding of cattle. PART V.11 TABLE I [Blank.]

Extract from the Proceedings of the Lieutenant-Governor of Eastern Bengal and Assam in the Agricultural Department, No. 581Ag., dated the 4th September 1911. READ The report of the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Eastern Bengal and Assam, on the Administration of the Veterinary Department for the year 1910-11 with the Director of Agriculture's forwarding remarks. RESOLUTION. 1. The decrease in the mortality from contagious diseases amongst bovines though not so striking as in the previous year, is a very satisfactory feature of the report. An actual decrease has taken place in the number of such cases treated by itinerant assistants, though there was a considerable increase in the total number of cases treated by them and a marked enlargement of their sphere of operations. The inference is thus justified that the Department is gradually acquiring a mastery over contagious disease which cannot fail to confer very substantial benefit on the community. 2. The statistics still leave much to be desired, though the development and increasing popularity of the Department and the weakening of former prejudices against inoculation should tend to effect a steady improvement in reporting. The Superintendent is inclined to discredit the returns from the Assam Valley on the ground that the Department's information does not bear out the figures, but in view of the presence of a regular land revenue staff which is in close touch with the cultivators, the Licutenant-Governor is inclined to suspect the accuracy of the returns from the rest of the Province. His Honour cordially agrees with the Director of Agriculture in deprecating the employment of Veterinary Assistants to check statis- tics while there is still so much disease to combat, but they can help to improve the statistics by impressing on the people the necessity for reporting even sporadic cases of disease at the time of occurrence. 3. The continued shortage in the supply of scrum is disquieting, but will, it is hoped, be of short duration, as the establishment of a second laboratory is under the consideration of the Government of India. Meanwhile the Lieutenant-Governor hopes that all local bodies and the officers of the Department will co-operate to prevent waste and so enable the supplies available to be economised to the best advantage. 4. The Lieutenant-Governor is glad to see that local bodies appear to be taking an increasing interest in improving the breed of cattle; the Director of Agriculture and the Superintendent should make every endeavour to enlist their sympathy and co-operation in the general scheme for the Province which is now being prepared. 5. A maximum limit of ten pages was prescribed by the Local Government for this report last year, but there should seldom be occasion to approach that length, and the Lieutenant-Governor desires that, in accordance with the expressed policy of the Government of India, every endeavour should be made to secure compression. In particular, it is not necessary to criticise in detail the work done in individual hospitals and dispensaries, for which particulars are available in table V, and" remarks on these institutions should be confined to salient points, including the results obtained in new institutions. 6. The Lieutenant-Governor agrees with the Director of Agriculture that great credit is du6 to Mr. Harris for bis successful administration of the Department and the satisfactory progress of veterinary work in the Province. The thanks of Govern- ment are also due to Mr. Hart himself for his careful supervision.
