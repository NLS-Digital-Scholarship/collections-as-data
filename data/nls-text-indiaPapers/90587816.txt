NOTES ON VACCINATION IN THE NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE FOR THE YEAR 1922-23 BY LT.-COL. W. M. ANDERSON, C.I.E., M.D., D.T.M. & H., I. M. S., Director of Public Health, North- West Frontier Province. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] PriceNotes on Vaccination in the North-West Frontier Province for the year 1922-23. REVIEW BY THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER. IN his review on the Vaccination Report for 1920-21 and again in that for 1921-22, the Chief Commissioner noted with regret the substantial decrease in the number of vaccinations as compared with the year 1919-20. The record for the year now under review presents a most welcome contrast. In spite of both the posts of Divisional Inspector having been brought under reduction, and in spite of a reduction of one in the number of Vaccinators, the number of operations rose from 100,219 in 1921-22 to 144,155, the latter figure being more than 9,000 in excess of the number for 1919-20. In the Hazara District alone was there a decrease as compared with the. average for the preceding five years. The increase in the number of revaccinations is parti- cularly gratifying. Further, the Chief Commissioner notes with satisfaction that, thanks to the large average of successful vaccinations per head of the staff, the average cost of each case was commendably low (Re. 0-2-7), in spite of the increased pay which has been in force since March 1921. The cost of each successful operation in the North-West Frontier Province now compares favourably with that in the Punjab and in the United Provinces. Small-pox did not occur in epidemic form and the number of scattered cases was unusually low, the total number of deaths recorded being only 118. The Chief Commissioner desires to tender his cordial acknowledgments to Lieutenant-Colonel W. M. Anderson, C.I.E., I. M S., for the marked success which has attended the efforts made by him to increase the efficiency of this important branch of the medical administration of the Province. C.

In May, instructions for vaccinators in their own vernacular were prepared and supplied to Civil Surgeons for distribution to them. At the beginning of the vaccination season, all vaccinators were summoned to head-quarters and the Civil Surgeons saw that each man was supplied with all the articles of equipment on the sanctioned list, and that he understood the instructions referred to above. He was then provided with a tour programme, directing him where he was to work during the next six months. The result has been a great increase in the output of work. Average number vacci- nated by each vaccinator. 4. The average number vaccinated by each vaccinator was 3,837.57. Dera Ismail Khan heads the list with an average of 5,053.5 per vaccinator, Hazara being next with 4,902.14. Vaccinations according to ages. 5. There were 108,460 successful primary vaccinations performed, 63,852 of which were on infants under one year and 34,454 on children between one and six years of age. The successful vaccinations were at the rate of 40.31 per mille of the population, the average for the preceding five years being 36.98. Re-vaccinations. 6. Thirty thousand one hundred and eighty-eight re-vaccinations were performed during the year compared with an average of
( 3 ) 17,980 in the preceding quinquennium. This is a great improvement. It is generally agreed that a single vaccina- tion does not produce immunity to small-pox for life. At least two re-vaccinations are necessary, especially if risk of infection occurs. Appendix to Statement No. I.( 4 ) cost of staff of Rs. 2,640, but much more lymph was purchased than in 1921, and this, with other minor expenses, reduced the savings to Rs. 1,968.

The total expenditure incurred was met from the funds noted below :( 5 ) Mardan this year 632 vaccination operations were performed by the staff of outlying dispensaries and in Kohat 269 oases were similarly vaccinated.

NOTES ON VACCINATION IN THE NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE FOR THE YEAR 1923-24 BY LIEUT.-COLONEL C. I. BRIERLEY, I. M. S., Director of Public Health, North-West Frontier Province. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Price Notes on Vaccination in the North-West Frontier Province for the year 1923-24. REVIEW BY THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER. THE Chief Commissioner notes with regret that the total number of vaccinations performed has fallen from 144,155 in the year 1922-23 to 128,200 in the year now under review. The marked decrease in the number of re-vaccinations is particularly disappointing. Poor work done by the vaccinator appointed to the Sherani Country, fresh appointments of inexperienced vaccinators and the abolition of the posts of three vaccinators working under the Municipal Committee of Peshawar are the main reasons assigned by the Chief Medical Officer for this falling off. Early in the year, the Peshawar Municipality, for reasons of economy, reduced their staff of vaccinators from five to two. The Chief Medical Officer has rightly pointed out that a staff of two vaccinators is quite inadequate to cope with the requirements of so large a city as Peshawar and the figures for the year bear eloquent testimony to the truth of his statement. The Chief Commissioner commends to the notice of the Municipal Committee the remarks of the Chief Medical Officer on the subject and trusts that they may see their way to remedy the existing state of affairs at an early date. Vaccination is a subject which vitally affects the health of the people and the Chief Commissioner hopes that Colonel Brierley's report will be read with interest by all Municipal Committees and District Boards throughout the Province. The total expenditure incurred on vaccination shows a reduction of Rs. 704 on the figures for the previous year The average cost of each successful operation rose from two annas and seven pies to two annas and nine pies. The inspection work done by Superintendents of Vaccination remained up to standard. Vaccination is becoming more popular among the rural population and there is little resistance to primary vaccination. Amongst the trans-frontier tribes its popularity is most marked. The Chief Commissioner notes with pleasure the good example set by Lala Kishen Chand of Peshawar City in facilitating vaccination work in his own and other quarters of the City.
( 2 ) The Province was practically free from small-pox during the year, except in the Peshawar District, where 82 deaths were recorded. In Peshawar City alone, 53 cases and 42 deaths occurred ; but in only one case did the disease occur amongst the vaccinated population. M. E.

The charge of the Vaccination Department was held by different officers during the year as follows :( 2 ) vaccinator appointed to the Sherani Country, who has since been dismissed and (2) to the entertainment of new vacci- nators who take some time to learn their work properly and get into touch with the people. Average number vacci- nated by each vaccinator. 4. The average number of operations performed by each vaccinator in the Province was 3,755.76. The Mardan Sub-Division heads the list with an average of 6365.33. The Kohat District shows the smallest amount of average work done by each vaccinator, viz. 3,093. Vaccinations according to ages. 5. There were 108,744 successful primary vaccinations performed, 62,083 of which were on infants under 1 year and 34,339 on children between 1 and 6 years of age. The successful vaccinations were at the rate of 36.51 per mille of the population. Re-vaccinations. 6. The value of vaccination is not fully appreciated by the majority of the population unless small-pox is prevalent. Only 19,363 revaccinations were performed during the year which is 10,825 less than in the preceding year. Appendix to Statement No. I( 3 ) Statement No. II.( 4 ) The most striking figures in this statement is the small number of births in Peshawar City when compared with the total number of vaccinations performed. The reason for the large number of vaccinations is that many vaccinations included in this statement are done on children in the City who belong to transfrontier tribes and traders always on the move. Early last year the Peshawar Municipality cut down their vaccination staff from five to two for economic reasons. I do not think they realized that they were, so to speak, cutting their own throats. Two vaccinators for a city of the size of Peshawar is quite inadequate to cope with the work and the result must be in time an increase of small-pox. It may not be fully understood that small-pox is not only a most dangerous disease to life but also the most disfiguring disease next to syphilis known, as a cause of complete blindness in children it is first and foremost. Most of the blind children and indeed many of the blind adults in Peshawar City I know from my own long experience in that City have lost their eyes as the result of small-pox. One of my first endeavours as Chief Medical Officer of this Province will be to try to induce Municipal Commissioners and District Boards to take a greater interest in this most important work of vaccination. Not only should the vacci- nation staff be brought up to its former full strength but also I consider that many of the Sub Assistant Surgeons in outlying dispensaries should during the winter months be given opportunity to vaccinate the surrounding population. Though this may increase the cost slightly of each success- ful case, yet it will without doubt increase the man-power of this Province to a very great extent. Every blind person requires an attendant to lead them about and cook their food. Appendix B.( 5 ) security. It is a well-known fact that small-pox epidemics visit us not yearly but after a term of years like influenza ; when the epidemic comes it is only those who have been properly vaccinated and re-vaccinated that escape. Particulars of lymph used. 15. Glycerinated chloroform lymph procured from the Punjab Vaccine Institute was used throughout the year. Reports from all Civil Surgeons state that the lymph was of good quality. Attitude of the people towards vaccination. 16. Vaccination is gradually becoming more popular among the rural population and there is a little resistance to primary vaccina- tion. Our task is therefore made all the easier provided we have a sufficient staff for the purpose. The very reverse of this is seen in the case of plague inoculation. Though I know that there is much opposition to compulsory vaccination not only in this country but also in many European countries including England yet I strongly agree with Colonel McPherson, Civil Surgeon, Peshawar, that the Vaccination Act should be extended not only to Peshawar City but to all districts of the Province. We have only to note the wonderful attendance of mothers with their children amongst the uneducated trans- frontier tribes for vaccination to realize what benefit they at any rate consider is produced by vaccination. General remarks. 17. In conclusion let me thank all those gentlemen who have been instrumental in further- ing the cause of vaccination by their personal example and endeavours in their towns and villages. I have also the pleasure of specially recommending for favourable notice of the Local Government Lala Kishan Chand, son of L. Shankar Dass, Dhawan, Municipal Com- missioner of Peshawar City, who by his zeal and exhorta- tions, has very much facilitated the vaccination work in his own and other quarters of Peshawar City. C.

Notes on Vaccination in the North-West Frontier Province for the year 1924-25. REVIEW BY THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER. THE Chief Commissioner notes with great satisfaction the very encouraging increase in the number of vaccinations performed during the year, amounting to no less than 148,474 operations compared with 128,200 in 1923-24. It is true that in 1923-24 the number was disappointingly low but the figures for the year under review present a welcome increase of no less than 4,319 on those for 1922-23 and are the highest recorded for the past five years. This is particularly praiseworthy owing to the fact that the vaccination staff remained the same for the major portion of the year. Towards the close of the year the District Board, Peshawar, were able to re-appoint two of the vaccinators who had been reduced in 1922-23, but even this left the staff reduced by one vaccinator as compared with the personnel in 1922-23. In view of the large increase in vaccination work the increase of Rs. 1,162 in the total expenditure under this head was to be expected, but the average cost of each successful operation fell from two annas and nine pies to the commendably low figure of two annas and six pies. There was no epidemic of small-pox during the year and the Province was practically free from this disease except in the Peshawar District where 234 deaths occurred out of a total of 309 for the whole Province. The Chief Commissioner wishes to express his thanks to Lieutenant-Colonel C. I. Brierley and to all Civil Surgeons for the excellent results which have been achieved in this important branch of medical administration. M. E.

The Bannu District shows the smallest amount of average work done by each vaccinator, viz. 3,144.33 as compared with 3,113.33 in the previous year. Vaccinations according to ages. 5. There were 111,830 successful primary vaccinations performed, 70,703 of which were on infants under one year and 34,160 on children between one and six years of age. The successful vaccinations were at the rate of 41.07 per mille of the population. Re-vaccinations. 6. 30,567 re-vaccinations were performed during the year, compared with an average of 20,178 in the preceding quinquennium. This is a very great and necessary improvement and it shows that the population of this Province are learning the value of re-vaccination in producing life-long immunity from small-pox.

Needless to say it was impossible for Sub-Assistant Surgeons in charge of dispensaries to spend whole days and nights in the surrounding villages. General remarks. 17. The vaccination work for the year has been on the whole very satisfactory and I must congratulate all Civil Surgeons on the results obtained, and at the same time exhort them to increasing their endeavours still further to popularize vaccination amongst the inhabitants of their districts in the coming year. My statistical clerk. Devi Chand, deserves credit for the keenness he has shown in carrying out his duties in this department during the past year. C. I. BRIERLEY, LIEUT.-COLONEL, I. M.

I. BRIERLEY, I.M.S., Director of Public Health, North-West Frontier Province. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Price Notes on Vaccination in the North West Frontier Province for 1925-26. REVIEW BY THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER. 1. In his Review on the Notes on Vaccination for the year 1924-25 the Chief Commissioner had occasion to express satisfaction at the very encouraging way in which the number of vaccination operations had increased. This year the number has again increased, this time by the remarkable figure of 79,430. There is no doubt that this is largely due to the fact that the Province was visited by a serious epidemic of small-pox which did not subside until late in the year and that, in consequence, the people presented themselves and their children more readily for vaccination. At the same time, it indicates that their confidence in the efficacy of vaccination and in the efficiency of the vaccination staff has increased considerably; and the Chief Commissioner is most gratified at the results achieved. 2. A notable instance of this improvement in the attitude of the people is reported from the Malakand Agency where, on the application of the subjects of the Wali of Swat two extra vaccinators were entertained for three months for work in Upper Swat and vaccinated nearly 7,000 children. The faith of these wild hill-men in vaccination as a prevention against small-pox and its attendant disfiguration is indeed striking. A further instance is the desire of the Mahsuds for vaccination, which came to the notice of the Chief Commissioner himself during his tour in Waziristan. 3. Four more vaccinators were entertained this year and the average number of operations performed by each vaccinator totalled close on 6,000. In Dera Ismail Khan District the work of the vaccinators was particularly good and the average exceeded 8,000.
( 2 ) 4. The number of vaccinations performed in trans- frontier tracts, as well as the total number of re-vaccinations performed have both more than doubled, while in Peshawar and Nowshera Cantonments nearly 14,000 persons were vaccinated as compared with 3,000 last year. The ratio of successful vaccinations was 61.32 per mille of the population against 41.07 last year. 5. In spite of this expansion the total amount spent on this important branch of the medical administration was only Rs. 22,839CONTENTS PARA. PAGE. 1. Administration ... ... ... 1 2.

I was in charge of the Vaccination Department throughout the year. Statement No. I.( 2 ) Average number vacci- nated by each vaccinator. 4. The average number of persons vaccinated by each vaccinator was 5,834.89. (The small amount of vaccination work done by Superintendents of Vaccination is ignored in calculating this figure.) The vaccinators in the Dera Ismail Khan head the list with an average of 8,337.0 per head. Hazara District is second with an average of 6,964.14. The Bannu District shows the smallest amount of average work done by each vaccinator, viz. 4,477.0. Vaccinations according to ages. 5. Of the 147,521 successful primary vaccinations 85,110 were on infants under one year of age and 49,100 on children of one, but under six years. The successful vacci- nations were at the rate of 61.32 per 1,000 of population, 35.94 being the average of the preceding five years. Re-vaccinations. 6. During the year the number of re-vaccinations performed was 73,618 against 30,567 in the year 1924-25. It is most satis- factory and it indicates that the population of this Province are learning the value of re-vaccination in producing life- long immunity from small-pox. Appendix to Statement No. I.( 3 ) where 6,878 children were vaccinated. It appears that the people of Upper Swat are realizing the benefits of vaccina- tion and are losing confidence in their previous practice of scale inoculation. Appendix to Statement No. I.( 4 ) 80.32 for primary and 75.50 for re-vaccination. Superintend- ents of Vaccination record a success of 98.48 for primary and 81.98 for re-vaccination. The inspection work done by Superintendents of Vaccination as compared with the previous year is as follows :( 5 ) Particulars of lymph used. 15. Throughout the year the lymph used has been glycerinated chloroform lymph procured from the Punjab Vaccine Institute.The lymph received was of good quality and gave satisfactoryresults. Attitude of the people towards vaccination. 16. The attitude of the people towards vaccination is on the whole favourable. During the year there has been a considerable increase of vaccination over the past year. General remarks. 17. It is very interesting to see that on the appearance of even a slight epidemic of small-pox in a province how quickly the people flock to the vaccination stations. Whatever the opinion may be in England regarding vaccination I can safely say that in this Province of India and particularly among the uneducated wild Frontier Tribes vaccination is looked upon as an almost certain prevention against the disease in a severe form and also against disfiguration. In this latter connection, namely disfiguration by small-pox, I have been immensely struck recently by the fact that it is seldom one sees young adolescents with pock- marked faces, whereas 15 years ago 80 per cent. were so inflicted. This was particularly brought to my notice when as Civil Surgeon I was medical examiner for various insurance companies. My statistical clerk, L. Devi Chand, deserves credit for the careful way he has carried out his duties in this depart- ment during the past year. C.I. BRIERLEY, LT.-COL., I. M.

Government of India Publications are obtainable from the Government of India Central Publication Branch, 3, Government Place, West, Calcutta, and from the following Agents :Notes on Vaccination in the North West Frontier Province for 1926-27. REVIEW BY THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER. IN the year 1926-27 the number of vaccinations performed was 185,957 as compared with 227,904 in the previous year. Though at first sight, disappointing, this decrease in the number of operations is partly accounted for by the fact that the epidemic of small-pox in the year under review was not so severe as in the preceding year. The Chief Commissioner is glad to note that the attitude of the people towards vaccination is, on the whole, favourable. The number of vaccinations performed in the agencies, too, has fallen from 36,217 in 1925 to 33,644 in 1926. The decrease is most noticeable in the Tochi and Malakand agencies where, in 1926, there was no such epidemic of small-pox as in the preceding year. The average number of persons inoculated by each vaccinator was 4,952.32 as compared with 5,834.89 in 1925-26. Hazara District heads the list with the creditable average of 6,987.14 per head. Dera Ismail Khan, however, which headed the list last year with an average of 8,337.0 per head now shows the poorest return, namely 3,317.80. No satisfactory explanation has been offered for this notable decrease. The total expenditure has risen slightly from Rs. 22,839 to Rs. 23,992. The average cost per successful operation has also risen from one anna nine pies to two annas three pies. Though this figure compares favourably with that for 1924, when the average cost was two annas six pies, and 1923, when the average cost was two annas nine pies, the Chief Commissioner hopes that it may be possible to keep down the average cost at the commendably low figure achieved in 1925.
2 The suggestion, made by the Chief Medical Officer that the Vaccination Act may be extended to the City of Peshawar and the Notified Areas of the Peshawar District is under consideration.

Government of India Publications are obtainable from theGovernment of India Central Publication Branch 3, Government Place, West, Calcutta, and from the following Agents :Notes on Vaccination in the North West Frontier Province for the year 1927-28. REVIEW BY THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER. The total number of vaccinations performed in 1927-28 was 200,632 against 185,957 in the preceding year. This increase is distinctly satisfactory, as it was not necessitated by any corresponding increase in small-pox. Indeed, small-pox played considerably less havoc in the year under report than in 1926-27, the number of deaths from this disease during the year 1926-27 and 1927-28 being 466 and 161 respectively. The decrease in mortality in Dera Ismail Khan District was particularly remarkable, there having been only one death from small-pox against 285 in the previous year. Yet Dera Ismail Khan records a satisfactory increase in the number of vaccinations performed. The number of persons vaccinated in political agencies, however, fell from 33,644 to 24,238. Though, at first sight, disappointing, this decrease is largely explained by the fact that small-pox was not prevalent in the agencies in an epidemic form. Nor did all the agencies contribute to this decrease. Both the Waziristan agencies and Kurram record an increase in the number of persons vaccinated. It is only in the Malakand Agency, particularly Chitral, and in the Sherani Country that there was a decrease. The average number of operations performed by each vaccinator rose from 4,952.32 to 5,135.20. As in the last year, Hazara District heads the list with an average of 7,394.14. It is satisfactory to note that Dera Ismail Khan, which, in 1926-27, was at the bottom of the list with an average of only 3,317.80, now stands second with an average of 6,250.00. Peshawar District shows the smallest average of work done by each vaccinator, namely 4,577.17. Another satisfactory feature is that the ratio of successful vaccination per 1,000 of population increased from 46.06, the average for the preceding five years, to 55.08 in the year under report.
2 The total expenditure during the year was Rs. 25,118 against Rs. 23,992 in the preceding year. The average cost per successful case of vaccination, however, remained the same as in 1926-27, namely Re. 0-2-3. The Chief Commissioner is glad to note that the attitude of the people towards vaccination was, on the whole, favourable. C. H.
