It is not surprising to learn, therefore, that the demand for inoculation was far in excess of what the department could meet with the limited resources at its command. 3. An outstanding feature of the report is the success which has so far attended the endeavours of the department to discover a cheaper method of immunizing cattle against rinderpest than serum simultaneous inoculation. If the further investigation of the method, which is now in progress, demonstrates its fitness for general adoption, Major Stirling and his collaborators may well congratulate themselves on having made a momentous contribution to the means of fighting rinderpest, since the new method reduces the cost of each operation from nearly Rs. 2 to a few annas. The scheme of controlling the import of cattle into the province, in order to check infection at its source, to which reference was made in last year's resolution, is still under examina- tion. The veterinary research scheme financed by the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research which was also mentioned last year is under way, and the results should strengthen the hands of the department in dealing with an infection that is largely responsible for causing debility in the cattle of the province, viz., piroplasmosis. 4. As in preventive so in curative activities the statistics of the year show a pleasing increase, the number of cases treated in the field and at dispensaries having risen to 636,637, the largest figure recorded during the last five years. The decrease in the number of mofussil cases, i.e., cases in which medicine was dispensed although the patients were not brought to the dispensary, bears testimony to the increasing appreciation by the cultivator of the importance of more exact methods of treatment. The increase in the number of castrations performed, from 71,639 to 107,966, is another striking proof of the success of sustained propaganda and represents a big step forward towards the improvement of cattle-breeding. 5. With its preventive work increasingly fruitful and public confidence assured, the department has an immense field of utility before it, bounded only in its resources in men and money. Like the other departments of Government it has not remained unscathed by the axe of retrenchment. The contributions
3 made by local bodies towards the housing and main- tenance of veterinary dispensaries has also been inadequate. With the return of better times the needs of the department, whose activities mean so much for the prosperity of the cultivator, must receive adequate recognition both by Government and local bodies, but in the meantime Government trusts that local bodies will take serious notice of the remarks of the Director of Veterinary Services on the urgent necessity of repairing the dispensary buildings. 6. The thanks of Government are due to Major Stirling for another year's energetic and efficient administration of his department. Government is also pleased to endorse his commendation of the work of the officers of the department whose names have been specially mentioned in the report. ORDER.No. 863-1-3 FROM MAJOR R. F. STIRLING, I.V.S., DIRECTOR OF VETERINARY SERVICES, Central Provinces, To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE, Central Provinces. Nagpur, the 11th July 1932. SIR, I have the honour to submit herewith the annual report on the working of the Civil Veterinary Department for the year ending the 31st March 1932. I regret the delay in submission which was occasioned by the fact that again the district reports did not reach my office until after the proper date. The last report was received as late as on the 6th July 1932 and the writing of the report could not be begun until these reports were received. 2. I held charge of the office of the Deputy Director of Veterinary Services, Central Provinces, in addition to my own duties till the afternoon of the 18th September 1931 when Rai Sahib R. V. Pillai returned from medical leave and resumed his duties. I toured in all divisions of the province and visited 60 hospitals and dispensaries. I inspected the offices of divisional and district officers, the village uplift move- ment and the experimental work in the field. I also inspected the more important slaughter-houses. 3. Rai Sahib R. V. Pillai, Deputy Director of Veterinary Services, Central Provinces, resumed charge of his duties on the forenoon of the 19th September 1931 on return from leave. He toured in Nagpur and Chhat- tisgarh Divisions, inspected 30 dispensaries and the offices subordinate to him.
2 I.3 9. During the year 26 students of the Nagpur Uni- versity, attending the Intermediate course in Agriculture, were examined by me in elementary veterinary subjects. II.4 discontinued owing to the comparatively heavy cost en- tailed. 3,277 cattle belonging mainly to agriculturists were protected by this method during the year so long as funds permitted. The beneficial effects of this method of protection having been made evident to the cultivators there were far more demands for such inoculations than could be undertaken for reasons stated above. Experiments on the efficacy of a cheaper type of &quot;vaccination&quot; of animals against rinderpest to which reference was made in the last year's report are still in progress ; the results so far achieved are very promising. An original interim paper on this method of vaccina- tion was contributed by me to the Veterinary Journal, London, and attracted some notice. A résumé of the work was also presented to the Royal Society of Medicine in collaboration with a pro- fessional colleague. Since the publication of this article advice has been sought from workers in Siam and China. It is hoped to make a further statement regarding this method of prevention which reduces the cost of each operation (staff excluded) from nearly Rs. 2 to a few annas. A separate communication about this work has been made to Government. 16. Foot-and-mouth disease.5 could be made in 239 instances only. The mortality re- corded was high, involving 6,591 cattle and 1,540 goats and sheep. The field staff had very heavy work in protecting cattle against this formidable disease. 103,525 animals were protected by vaccine, 12,028 by anti-hæmorrhagic septicæmia serum, while 11,542 underwent hæmorrhagic septicæmia vaccine-serum inoculation. The results of vaccination against this disease have been all that could be desired and it is regrettable that owing to shortage of funds more cattle could not be so protected. 19. Blackquarter.6 20. Piroplasmosis.7 In consideration of the prevalence of this disease in the province, during the year anti-rabic treatment for dogs was made available in all the divisional head- quarters. 26. Fowl cholera and spirochætosis.8 4.9 The need for medicine has declined remarkably when antiseptics of equal value but not phenyle have been supplied. 37. Buildings.10 41. Sanads were awarded during the year to land- owners and others in recognition of their assistance to the subordinate staff of the department while carrying out veterinary propaganda work in the district. IV.11 47. The names of the following officers are brought to the notice of the local Government for their good work during the year : 12 Whether so much can be done in a &quot;rinderpest year&quot; is very doubtful, unless there is an increase of staff and of the money provided for the department. 50. The Commissioner, Nagpur, organized a meet- ing during the year, at which a provisional committee was elected to frame the rules and constitution of a local branch of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. It is my earnest hope that before the next annual report has to be written a step forward will have been made to minimise the cruelty which, unfortunately, is all too common. 51. The seventh annual meeting of the Central Provinces Veterinary Association was held at Nagpur during November 1931. It was largely attended and many interesting papers were read and discussed. From January 1932 a Central Provinces Veterinary Association's Quarterly Journal was started, and it is hoped that this small magazine, which has been so kindly welcomed by senior officers and by the English veterinary press, will bind together more closely the members of the association and the department. 52. Before concluding my report I take the oppor- tunity to thank heartily all the officers of the department who, in every grade and with very few exceptions, worked so well in a year in which financial considerations hamper- ed to some extent their touring and the development of the work in the area in their charge whether division, district or tahsil. 53. I may be allowed also to thank the Divisional Commissioners, Deputy Commissioners and chairmen of local bodies who, in submitting reports and also at other times, have made many helpful suggestions for the better- ment of the work of the department. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, R. F. STIRLING, MAJOR, Director of Veterinary Services, Central Provinces.

Agents for the sale of Publications issued by the Central Provinces Government [NOTE.No. 655-688-XIV GOVERNMENT OF THE CENTRAL PROVINCES AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT Nagpur, the 30th August 1933. READ2 These high figures are a proof of the growing confidence of the public in the department for it is clear that cattle owners report outbreaks far more readily than they did in the past. In this connection, Government gladly notes the attempts made by the department to instruct the general public by means of propaganda at fairs and shows and printed leaflets, about cattle diseases. It has also learnt with interest that a proposal to institute a campaign of destruction of stray dogs in municipal areas is under consideration and trusts that local bodies will co-operate fully in this effort to save valuable human and animal lives. The department will find in the Central Provinces Cattle Diseases Act when it comes into force and the recent amendment of the Forest Manual requiring graziers to permit inoculation of herds encamping in grazing areas the necessary means to stamp out and control the various cattle diseases. 3. Once, again, Government would draw the atten- tion of the local bodies to the importance of maintaining the Veterinary dispensary buildings in good repair. These dispensaries are doing increasingly useful work and it is for the local bodies to see that no differences arise in regard to the amounts of contributions to be made for their maintenance and if, unfortunately, they arise, to settle them amicably with the least possible delay. 4. Government is interested to learn that a society for the prevention of cruelty to animals has been esta- blished in Nagpur and trusts that it will soon prove its usefulness by its record of beneficent activities. 5. Major Stirling was in charge of the department throughout the year except for a few days towards the end when R. S. Pillai succeeded him. The thanks of Government are due to Major Stirling for his success- ful administration of the department and to R. S. Pillai for an interesting report. Government has also noted with pleasure the names of those officers whose work has been specially recommended. ORDER.3 and Lands, that copies be forwarded to the Director of Veterinary Services and to all Commissioners and Deputy Commissioners, Central Provinces and Berar, for information and guidance, and that it be published in Part I of the Central Provinces Gazette. By order of the Government, (Ministry of Agriculture), Y. N. SUKTHANKAR, Revenue Secretary to Government, Central Provinces. GPNNo. 982-1-3 FROM RAI SAHEB R. V. PILLAI, C.P.V.S. (CLASS I), OFFG. DIRECTOR OF VETERINARY SERVICES, Central Provinces, To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT, Central Provinces. Nagpur, the 29th June 1933: SIR, I have the honour to submit the annual report on the working of the Civil Veterinary Department for the financial year 1932-33. 2. Major R. F. Stirling, I.V.S., held charge of the department until the 12th March 1933 when he proceed- ed on leave for four months. 3. He toured in all the divisions of the province except Chhattisgarh and inspected 50 dispensaries and the important slaughter-houses. He inspected the offices of the divisional Deputy Superintendents and the district Veterinary Inspectors, the work of the veteri- nary assistant surgeon on rural uplift scheme and the field experimental work on goat virus alone vaccination against rinderpest. He also inspected the work of the Veterinary Investigation Officer, Central Provinces. He attended the meetings held at Delhi of the advisory board of the imperial council of agricultural research and its animal husbandry wing during February 1933.
2 4. I took over charge of the department as officiat- ing Director of Veterinary Services on the 13th March 1933 and held charge of it, for the rest of the year. I toured in the Nagpur and Chhattisgarh civil divi- sions and in the districts of Jubbulpore and Mandla, inspected 31 dispensaries, the main slaughter-houses and the subordinate offices in the two former civil divisions. 5. Rai Saheb Gouri Shanker Shrivastava, Deputy Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Berar Division, was appointed as officiating Deputy Director of Veterinary Services, with effect from the 13th March 1933. 6. Mr. Bachan Singh, M.R.C.V.S., was appointed as Veterinary Investigation Officer, Central Provinces, by the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research with effect from the 20th June 1932. He was deputed to the Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research, Muktesar, for a six months' course of training, prior to his joining at Nagpur, on the 19th December 1932. He investigated certain specific problems relating to cattle diseases in the Chhattisgarh area of the province during the year. I.3 successfully passed the diploma examination. Of these only six could be entertained in the department during the current year. One second year student passed the annual examination and was promoted to the third year class. 10. Compounders' class.4 a portion of such work to him to be undertaken under field conditions and thereby give some relief to the staff employed in the Laboratory in the matter of heavy routine diagnostic work. Orders were, therefore, passed at the close of the year for the Laboratory staff to con- centrate on pathological, parasitological and bacterio- logical specimens only. 2.5 during the year6 29,451 cattle were immunised with blackquarter agressin, 2,669 with serum alone and 1,537 with black- quarter aggressin and serum simultaneously. The Department had been attempting the effective control of this disease and the one mentioned immediately preceding this, viz., hæmorrhagic septicæmia by vaccinating animals for these diseases prior to their actual occurrence in areas known to have been infected. When work on these lines is sufficiently progressed it is hoped that losses due to these diseases would be brought to the minimum. 22. Piroplasmosis.7 In consideration of the prevalence of this disease in the provinces, Anti-rabic treatment was made available in all the divisional headquarters since last year. A proposal to advise local bodies to institute a campaign of destruction of stray dogs in municipal areas in order to safeguard valuable human and animal lives is under consideration. 27. Fowl cholera and spirochaetosis.8 and consequent death rate during outbreaks of contagious diseases in the vicinity. When work on these element- ary lines is sufficiently advanced other and more im- portant concomitant factors in relation to cattle health and disease will be taken up for study. 3.9 37. For a second time the department has passed the 100,000 figure in the matter of castrations. That this has been possible in a &quot;Rinderpest year&quot; goes to show what can be achieved with sustained effort. The steady decline of the so called cases which are supplied with medicines is a healthy sign and the staff has been instructed to persue this system without giving cause for any real hardship. 38. Buildings.10 lectures with magic lantern shows on veterinary matters. Practical demonstrations in inoculation, castration, spraying and intervenous injections were also undertaken whenever found necessary. Pamphlets in Hindi and Marathi were written by the staff of the department on important veterinary subjects for wholesale distribution as a stimulus to village uplift work. 41. Sanads were awarded during the year to land- owners and others in recognition of the assistance given by them to the subordinate staff of the department while carrying out veterinary propaganda work in the districts. IV.11 45. Recruiting.12 contribution towards the maintenance of veterinary dis- pensaries situated within their areas of jurisdiction has somewhat hampered veterinary progress in those areas. Nothing but a sense of public spirit with which the mem- bers of these bodies should be imbued with will lighten the task of this department in ensuring efficient veterinary aid being imparted to the cattle owners of these areas. 49. The Central Provinces Cattle Diseases Act of 1933 which is published for general information, when passed into law, will be welcomed by all cattle owners and the department will find in it the one effective way by which the present death rate of cattle due to rinderpest may be properly controlled. Not less important is the recent amendment to the Forest Manual which the local Government was pleased to issue enjoining on graziers to permit inoculation of herds encamping in grazing areas on the occurrence of rinderpest. 50. At long last, a society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has been formed in Nagpur and the animal-loving public should be thankful to its prime mover Mr. G. A. Khan, B.A. (Cantab.), C.I.E., O.B.E., I.C.S. Grateful thanks are also due to the other organizers of this society. This is a subject on which the officers of the department felt keenly for long. 51. Brief mention was made in the body of the report on the progress of the special vaccination against rinderpest first undertaken on a large scale in this province. A proposal for a special research grant is before the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research which when sanctioned will form the basis for an expan- sion of the activities of this type of field research. 52. In paragraph 49 of the previous year's report my predecessor made cautions mention of the possibility of cutting short a section of the activities of the depart- ment, viz., propaganda in a &quot;rinderpest year&quot;. It goes, therefore, to the credit of the rank and file of the depart- mental staff that with twenty short of the sanctioned cadre of Veterinary Assistant Surgeons, the work achieved during the year has shown marked progress in all its activities. This had been a &quot;rinderpest year'' yet pro- paganda work in the special area selected for intensive
13 village uplift work at Piparia and wherever their ser- vices were required the officers had been assiduous in their efforts to educate the village communities in all matters connected with veterinary and allied branches of science. 53. The eighth annual meeting of the Central Provinces Veterinary Association was held during November 1932. The members who attended were as keen as ever in submitting interesting professional papers and taking part in the discussions which followed. The Central Provinces Veterinary Journal has entered into the second year of its existence and has been of real benefit to its readers among whom we count the large majority of our staff. 54. Major Stirling, I.V.S., has practically controlled the department during the year under report. The achievements embodied in the report are in a great measure due to his wise and courageous direction. I am sure, therefore, that he would expect me to thank all members of the department for the part each one played in its successful working during the year. 55. To all Divisional Commissioners, Deputy Com- missioners and Chairmen of local bodies and others who assisted the department with helpful suggestions I may tender thanks. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, R. V. PILLAI, Offg. Director of Veterinary Services, Central Provinces.

Agents for the sale of Publications issued by the Central Provinces Government [NOTE.No. 2015-919-XIV GOVERNMENT OF THE CENTRAL PROVINCES AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT Pachmarhi, the 9th October 1934. READ2 was also taken of the larger cattle fairs and other means of propaganda for giving increased publicity to these activities. Government shares the Director's disappointment at the apathy of many local bodies towards the provi- sion and repair of dispensary buildings. Expenditure for ensuring the efficiency and expansion of a depart- ment, which does so much to conserve the cattle-wealth of the agriculturists, is certainly an important charge on local funds even in the present financial strigency; and Government hopes that there will be a better response in future to its appeal regarding this matter. 3. Government has noted with interest that the year marked a further advance in the researches in connec- tion with the goat-virus inoculation against rinderpest. The cost of inoculation can now be reduced from three annas per head to one anna per six to ten animals, while the district reports indicate that the period of immunity derived from this method of inoculation promises to be longer. These results encourage the hope that the ideal of the eventual eradication of rinderpest envisaged by the Director is not perhaps utopian; and Government trusts that they will facilitate the working of the Cattle Diseases Act which was passed into law after the close of the year. Power has been taken by this measure to prohibit the import into the province of unimmunized and peripatetic herds of cattle which are responsible for the dissemination of infection, particularly that of rinderpest. The Veterinary Investigation Officer, appointed by the Imperial Council of Agricultural Re- search, continued his local enquiries regarding certain cattle diseases and internal parasites. Government's thanks are due to the Council for its financial assistance, which has made this intensive study of the aetiology of the cattle diseases of the province possible. 4. Much credit is due to the officers of the depart- ment for the year's record of preventive, curative and research work and Government has read with pleasure the Director's commendation of it. It also records its appreciation of the efficient administration of the depart- ment by the Director, Major R. F. Stirling, and the Deputy Director, Rao Bahadur R. V. Pillai, who officiated as Director for part of the year.
3 ORDER.No. 764-1-3 FROM MAJOR R. F. STIRLING, I.V.S., DIRECTOR OF VETERINARY SERVICES, Central Provinces, To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT, Central Provinces. Nagpur, the 20th July 1934. SIR, I have the honour to submit herewith the annual report on the working of the Civil Veterinary Department for the year ending the 31st March 1934. 2. Rai Sahib (now Rai Bahadur) R. V. Pillai, Officiating Director of Veterinary Services, held charge of the department till (the afternoon of) the 12th July 1933, when he proceeded on leave for five months and eleven days. He toured in the Chhindwara, Mandla, Jubbulpore, Saugor, Hoshangabad and Betul districts and inspected 15 dispensaries, the office of the Assistant Director of Veterinary Services, Jubbulpore Division, the village up- lift work at Pipariya and the slaughter-house at Rahatgarh. 3. On return from leave I resumed charge of the department on the 12th July 1933. I toured in all the divisions of the province and in- spected 54 dispensaries and the important slaughter- houses. I inspected the offices of the Divisional Assist- ant Directors of Veterinary Services, the village uplift work at Pipariya and the experimental work on goat- virus alone vaccination against rinderpest. I also attended the meetings of the Advisory Board of the Im- perial Council of Agricultural Research held at New Delhi during February 1934.
2 4. Rai Sahib Gouri Shanker Shrivastava held charge of the office of the Deputy Director of Veterinary Services till the 2nd January 1934. He toured in the Amraoti, Akola, Yeotmal, Chanda and Nagpur districts and inspected 19 dispensaries and attended the rural uplift training class at Rahatgaon. 5. Rai Bahadur R. V. Pillai, on return from leave, resumed charge of his duties as Deputy Director of Veteri- nary Services on (the forenoon of) the 2nd January 1934. He toured in the Nagpur and Chhattisgarh divisions, inspected 10 dispensaries and the office of the Assistant Director of Veterinary Services, Chhattisgarh Division, Raipur. 6. Mr. Bachan Singh, Veterinary Investigation Officer, continued to carry out investigations relating to the cattle diseases of this province. I.3 II.4 19. Foot-and-mouth disease.5 23. Piroplasmosis.6 29. Distemper and Canine Typhus.7 37. The number of cases treated by the Assistant Directors, Veterinary Inspectors and Veterinary Assist- ant Surgeons on tour was 675,617 (580,676) including 127,475 (105,769) castrations. The number of cases treated at dispensaries was 194,718 (187,025) including 15,214 (13,391) castrations. The mofussil cases, i.e., those supplied with medicines but not brought to the dis- pensaries, were reduced from 44,790 to 20,587. In addi- tion 8,388 (14,867) cases were supplied with medicines by the staff on tour. 38. The reduction in the number of mofussil cases is pleasing but efforts are being made to reduce this num- ber still further. 39. Buildings.8 IV.9 previously vaccinated by goat-virus displayed any symp- tom of the disease, although the vaccinations had been carried out a year or more before. In previous reports it had been said that we had been successful in reducing the cost of this method to annas three a head instead of Re. 1-12-0 to Rs. 2-2-0. It is now possible to state that, provided a sufficiency of animals are available at one time in one area, the charge can be reduced further and that from 6 to 10 animals can be protected by material costing one anna. It would take too much space in this report even to summarize the means by which we have been able to reduce the price still further. The publication of the full details of the work carried out must await the time when there is leisure to compile the increasingly large amount of information that has been garnered by an enthusiastic body of workers serving under me. Sufficient is it to say that, when the finances of this Province are such as to warrant the increase of the veterinary department to the extent recommended by the Royal Commission on Agriculture and when the people are induced (by legislation or education) to offer willingly or otherwise their cattle for inoculation, then will come a time when rinderpest will be an unknown disease in this part of India. 49. Requests have been made from various places for goat-virus work to be carried out in particular herds. Our present policy is however to inoculate as many- cattle as are offered in villages situated five miles on either side of the main cattle routes beginning in the Khurai- Banda section. It would be a splendid thing if we could have special men in each district devoting their whole attention to this method of protection. The local Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, being the only man in a tahsil, cannot possibly combine it with his other manifold duties. When provincial finances improve, this may perhaps be a feasible proposition. At present the policy mentioned above must be pur- sued, the only exceptions being in the case of valuable herds. 50. One of the best indications of the growing con- fidence of the people in the department in the greater part
10 of the Province is that they have permitted 142,689 (119,160), of their useless bulls to be castrated. This work must slowly but inevitably result in a general im- provement of the cattle population, especially if com- bined with the introduction of better bulls. It is regretted that the abominable practice of castra- tion by &quot;mulling&quot; still exists in some places. With the aid of the revenue authorities it may be possible to substi- tute the better method throughout every area by per- suasive means only. If these do not succeed fully in the next year or so, if will be for serious consideration as to whether or not this cruel practice should be forbidden by law. 51. Nothing has been heard of the provincial branch of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals since the last annual report. 52. Reporting of contagious disease by village officials has improved and for this the thanks of the department are due to Deputy Commissioners and other revenue officers. Proposals are at present being con- sidered by Government to ensure that information of out- breaks reaches the local veterinary surgeon still more speedily. The interval between the receipt of the report and the attendance by the veterinary officer has been con- siderably reduced during the past two years. 53. It has long been recognized by this department that the total mortality figures either in connection with outbreaks or otherwise are not always reliable. Proposals have been put forward for the better maintenance of mortality records in villages. 54. The tenth annual conference of the Central Provinces Veterinary Association was held in January 1934. There was a record attendance and possibly the papers read and the discussions resulting reached a higher level than in any previous year. Leave to attend these annual meetings is granted as freely as possible in the belief that the more the scattered members of the depart- ment can meet with their colleagues, the better is the general morale of the staff. 55. I cannot close this report without publicly thanking Rai Bahadur R. V. Pillai for the careful and
11 efficient manner in which he officiated for me during my absence on leave. On his behalf and my own, I thank all Commissioners, Deputy Commissioners, Chairmen of local bodies and others who assisted the department to attain the results recorded in this report. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, R. F. STIRLING, MAJOR, Director of Veterinary Services, Central Provinces.

READ2 3. It is gratifying to note that the methods and details of the goat-virus inoculation against rinderpest were further perfected. To this end an intensive programme of inocula- tion was instituted towards the close of the year with a large staff, under the immediate supervision of the Veterinary Investigation Officer, in order to test the efficacy of the system in the varying field conditions in which the cattle of the province live. The Cattle Diseases Act became law during the year and gives Government power to prohibit the import into the province of unim- munised and peripatetic herds of cattle which are mainly responsible for the dissemination of rinderpest infection. In view of the success and the lowering of the cost of the goat-virus inoculation, it is expected to bring the Act into force in the near future. Government again records its gratitude to the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research for its generous financial assistance without which it would have been difficult to continue the valuable research and experimental work. 4. Government's thanks are due to the officers of the department for their good work during the year. It is with deep regret that Government has to record the sudden death of the Director, Major R. F. Stirling, after the close of the year. Major Stirling was the pioneer of goat-virus inoculation and his work in that connection has deservedly carried his reputation beyond the confines of the province. He raised the administration of the depart- ment to a high pitch of efficiency and effected a marked expansion in all the activities of the department. His sudden death has been a great loss to the province. ORDER.No. 966-1-3 FROM RAI SAHIB GOURI SHANKER SHRIVASTAVA, OFFG. DIRECTOR OF VETERINARY SERVICES, Central Provinces, To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT, Central Provinces. Nagpur, the 26th August 1935. SIR, I have the honour to submit herewith the annual report on the working of the Civil Veterinary Department for the year ending the 31st March 1935, left by Major R. F. Stirling. It is regretted that the delay in submitting this report was occasioned by the fact that the district reports did not reach this office in time. Had it not been for the sudden death of Major R. F. Stirling, the report would have been submitted by him. 2. He held charge of the department for the whole of the year under review. He toured in all the divisions of the province, inspected 47 dispensaries, the more important slaughter houses, the offices of the divisional Assistant Directors of Veterinary Services, the village uplift work at Pipariya and the work of the Veterinary Investigation Officer. 3. Rai Bahadur R. V. Pillai held charge of the office of the Deputy Director of Veterinary Services till the afternoon of the 24th March 1935 when he proceeded on leave out of India for eight months. He toured in the Nagpur and Chhattisgarh Divisions, inspected 34 dispensaries and the office of the Assistant Director of Veterinary Services, Chhattisgarh Division, Raipur. 4. I took charge of the office of the Deputy Director of Veterinary Services from the forenoon of the 25th March 1935. 5. Mr. Bachan Singh continued in the capacity of the Investiga- tion Officer; and the report of his work has been forwarded to the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research.
2 I.3 11. The above figures exclude 268 smears, examined by the Divisional Assistant Directors of Veterinary Services. The details of the positive findings under this head are given on page 1 of Appendix A. 2. CONTAGIOUS DISEASES 12. From the statistics given below, it may be concluded that the year under report was a healthy one for the cattle. The marked decrease in the number of outbreaks recorded also goes to support this view. The year closed with 10,180 (13,656) outbreaks of cattle diseases. The mortality from all diseases reported was 27,280 (37,804). 13. The expenditure on biological products amounted to Rs. 75,071 (Rs. 70,732). 14. The field staff, as in past years, continued the propaganda work, which had the desired effect of bringing down outbreaks, opposition to inoculation and other veterinary activities. This is evidenced by the large number of inoculations, both preventive and curative i.e., 485,471 (448,993) carried out during the year. 15. Rinderpest.4 Vaccination against this disease is getting very popular. In the year under report, the department was able to protect 168,818 (101,322) heads of cattle by vaccination. Incidentally this demon- strates the popularity Hæmorrhagic septicæmia vaccination is gaining amongst the cattle-owners. In addition to the vaccination, 47,922 (38,323) cattle were protected in actual outbreaks either by serum-alone or serum-vaccine- simultaneous method. 20. Blackquarter.5 25. Tetanus.6 III.7 V.8 48. The remarks in connection with the prompt reporting of outbreaks of cattle epidemics and endemics by village officers still hold good. There is practically very little improvement in this direction. 49. The Central Provinces Veterinary Conference was held in the month of November last and as usual it was characterised by great activities on the part of all members present. 50. Major R. F. Stirling was the best foreman of the depart- ment. It has been a tragedy that he passed away suddenly in the prime of his life when his services were much needed for the advancement of the scientific treatment of animals. It is a pity that he could not see full success of goat virus vaccination against rinderpest of which he was the pioneer. He took a very keen interest in controlling some of the most deadly epidemics and endemics (rinderpest, haemorrhagic septicaemia, blackquarter, anthrax, etc.) existing in the province and helped in mitigating the prevalence of cattle diseases which have been a source of heavy economic loss to the impecunious peasantry of this province for centuries. Vaccination, serum inoculation, etc. were extensive pushed on and a glance at the past statistics would manifest a rise of about 100 per cent in all these activities. 51. The thanks of the department are especially due to all Commissioners, Deputy Commissioners, chairmen of local bodies and all others who assisted the veterinary staff to attain the results recorded in this report. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, G. SHANKER, Offg. Director of Veterinary Services, Central Provinces.

Village uplift training classes were held at Drug and Powarkheda in Hoshangabad district during the year and lectures on contagious cattle diseases, veterinary hygiene and cruelty to animals were deliver- ed by the officers of the department at these classes with the aid of a magic lantern. 32. The number of cases treated by the Assistant Directors, Veterinary Inspectors and Veterinary Assist- ant Surgeons on tour was 770,382 (726,434) including 151,073 (143,139) castrations. The number of cases treated at dispensaries was 244,227 (227,971) including 20,586 (17,842) castrations. The number of cases that were supplied with medicines but not brought to the dispensaries was 3,490 (5,368). On tour 2,633 (3,978) cases were supplied with medicines by the staff. 33. Buildings.8 IV.9 in cattle from this highly contagious disease so far as pos- sible. It is also proposed to mark out different areas in the province where hæmorrhagic septicæmia has been causing high mortality for many years with a view to carry out hæmorrhagic septicæmia vaccination work extensively before the rains. Measures for dealing with blackquarter, foot-and-mouth disease, anthrax, try- panosomiasis, piroplasmosis, coccidiosis, etc., will con- tinue to receive serious attention. I may, however, point out that more staff is necessary for dealing properly with contagious diseases amongst live-stock in the province. 46. The number of veterinary dispensaries in the province, viz., 104, is very small considering the cattle population. In my opinion it is necessary that more veterinary dispensaries should be opened in rural areas so that outbreaks of contagious diseases could be dealt with most effectively as soon as a report of an outbreak is received. At present the area in charge of a Veterin- ary Assistant Surgeon is far too long and it is not possible for him to tour in all the villages in order to carry out castration work and treat contagious and non-contagi- ous cases amongst live-stock. There are several places where we have not got standard plan buildings on account of which veterinary work in the province con- tinues to suffer. The number of cases treated was 770,382 (726,434), including 151,073 (143,139) castra- tions. The number of cases treated at dispensaries was 244,227 (227,971) including 20,586 (17,842) castrations. The number of cases that were supplied with medicines but not brought to the dispensaries was 3,490 (5,368). On tour 2,633 (3,978) were supplied with medicines by the staff. 47. The question of providing an up-to-date laboratory at Nagpur for carrying out research work in connection with contagious diseases commonly found amongst live-stock in the province is of very great import- ance, and the sooner funds are sanctioned for this pur- pose the better. The Veterinary Investigation Officer at Saugor has not got an up-to-date laboratory and there- fore the work in connection with research is bound to suffer. In my opinion, special staff for research work should be recruited. 48. The death of the late Major Stirling was a great loss to the province. His place was taken up tem- porarily by Rai Sahib Gouri Shankar Shrivastava, who retired, with effect from the 12th November 1935.

Castrations numbered 167,519 [171,659], the small fall being attribut- able to a larger number of calves likely to become good bulls being left uncastrated. As many as 100 outlying dis- pensaries were opened to provide better facilities for live- stock owners in the interior. 4.

GAREWAL, ESQ., M.R.C.V.S., I.V.S., DIRECTOR OF VETERINARY SERVICES, Central Provinces and Berar, To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT, Central Provinces and Berar. Nagpur, the 13th July 1937. SIR, I have the honour to submit the Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Central Provinces and Berar, for the year ending the 31st March 1937. 2. Rai Bahadur R. V. Pillai officiated as Director from the 1st April to the 18th June 1936 and was revert- ed to his substantive post from the 19th June 1936. During this period he inspected the veterinary dispensa- ries at Pachmarhi, Sakoli, Gondia, Waraseoni, Baihar and Balaghat and the work of the Veterinary Assistant Sur- geon posted at Pipariya in connection with rural uplift scheme. 3. I took over the charge on the 19th June 1936 and held it till the end of the year under report. During this. period I inspected the following 92 veterinary dispensa- ries out of 104 in the Province : 2 Bhandara, Gondia, Sakoli, Balaghat, Baihar, Waraseoni, Raipur, Dhamtari, Bhatapara, Balodabazar, Mahasamund, Saraipalli, Pithora, Drug, Gandai, Bemetara, Bilaspur, Mungeli, Pendra, Pandaria, Janjgir, Jub- bulpore, Patan, Mandla, Narayanganj, Dindori, Shahpura, Saugor, Khurai, Banda, Damoh, Hatta, Hoshangabad, Pachmarhi, Sohagpur, Gadarwara, Narsinghpur, Harda, Seoni-Malwa, Khandwa, Harsud, Burhan- pur, Amraoti City, Ellichpur, Amraoti Camp, Anjangaon-Surji, Chikalda, Dharni, Daryapur, Morsi, Chandur, Akola, Murti- zapur, Karanja, Mangrulpir, Basim, Akot, Balapur, Patur, Yeotmal, Umerkhed, Pusad, Digras, Darwah, Kelapur, Wun, Malkapur, Buldana, Deolgaon-Raja, Chikhli, Mehkar, Jalgaon, Khamgaon and Shegaon. The work of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon posted at Pipariya in connection with the rural unlift scheme work was also inspected. This is the first time that so many veterinary dispensaries were inspected. During these tours several villages in different districts were visited in connection with contagious diseases, in- oculation, castration, etc., and necessary action taken with a view to reduce mortality in livestock from different contagious diseases and improve castration and other veterinary work in the Province. The main routes through which cattle enter the Central Provinces through Saugor and Hoshangabad districts from outside were in- spected and places selected for quarantine stations. Pro- posals in this connection have been submitted to the Gov- ernment before introducing the Cattle Diseases Act. I attended the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Meetings of the Advisory Board of the Imperial Council of Agricul- tural Research held at Simla and Delhi during July 1936 and February 1937, respectively. The Second Meeting of the Animal Husbandry Wing of the Board of Agricul- ture and Animal Husbandry held at Madras during December 1936 was also attended by me. I supervised the work of the Veterinary Investigation Officer, Central Provinces, and also checked the work of the goat virus vaccination staff which is financed by the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research.
3 The work in connection with the goat virus vaccina- tion received special attention. Two Assistant Directors of Veterinary Services, 8 Veterinary Inspectors and 58 Veterinary Assistant Surgeons were trained at the Cen- tral Veterinary Laboratory, Nagpur. The number of goat virus vaccinations done is a record so far achieved in the Province in dealing with rinderpest which has been the cause of high mortality in cattle during the previous years. Similarly necessary measures were taken in dealing with hæmorrhagic septicæmia. Surra was found pre- valent in different districts and the treatment of nagonal was introduced with very good results. The work of test- ing cattle against tuberculosis at different Government cattle-breeding farms was also taken up and very useful data in this connection has been collected by subjecting animals to the double intradermal tuberculin test. Differ- ent diseases in poultry which had been causing high mor- tality such as spirochætosis, fowl cholera, etc., received special attention. Proposals for the opening of 46 dispensaries in the Province with a view to check more effectively the con- tagious diseases and treatment of animals were submitted to the Government. 100 outlying veterinary dispensaries were opened during the year under report in different districts of the Province with a view to help livestock owners to get the necessary veterinary aid which have given very good results and are much appreciated. Different areas in the Province were visited where mortality from contagious diseases in the past has been very high and necessary action taken in dealing with different diseases. Several problems relating to the use of goat virus in dealing with rinderpest, nazal granuloma, skin diseases, piroplasmosis, glanders, hæmorrhagic sep- ticæmia, blackquarter, coccidiosis and tick fever received special attention. 4. Rai Bahadur R. V. Pillai held charge of the post of Deputy Director of Veterinary Services from the 19th June till the 9th December 1936, when he proceeded on eight months' leave on medical certificate. During the period, he toured in Raipur and Bilaspur districts and inspected Bilaspur dispensary. 5. Mr. P. S. Nair held charge as officiating Deputy Director of Veterinary Services, Central Provinces, from the 1st April to the 18th June 1936 and again from the 3
4 10th December 1936 till the end of the year. During this period he toured in Nagpur, Chanda, Chhindwara, Betul, Bhandara and Balaghat districts and inspected 22 dispen- saries and the office of the Veterinary Inspector, Gondia. 6. Mr. Bachan Singh continued to work as Veter- inary Investigation Officer, Central Provinces, through- out the year and supervised the work of the goat virus staff sanctioned by the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research. He carried out investigations into the blood protozoan and bacterial diseases, bovine trypanosomiasis, coccidiosis, contagious abortion in cows, skin diseases and diseases of fish. His detailed report has already been sub- mitted to the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research. He was deputed for a short course of training at the Im- perial Veterinary Research Institute, during August 1936.

With a view to help the Veterinary Inspectors in diagnosing different diseases in the field and thereby quickly diagnose different diseases instead of waiting for the results from the Central Laboratory, microscopes and other things necessary for laboratory work were supplied to the Veterinary Inspectors, Hoshangabad, Akola, Yeotmal, Saugor and Gondia. 12.

All the cattle fairs and shows in the Province were attended and camp dispensaries opened at these places. 48. An up-to-date veterinary laboratory in Nagpur is urgently required for carrying out research work in con- nection with different diseases found in livestock in this Province. 49. The office staff worked hard and worked well during the year under report though there was consider- able increase in the office work. The Veterinary Investi- gation Officer, Deputy Director and all the Assistant Directors took keen interest in their work. 50. I would like to take this opportunity of thank- ing all the Commissioners, Deputy Commissioners and Chairmen, District Councils, for the help received, with- out which it would not have been possible for the staff to do work mentioned in this report. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, J. S. GAREWAL, Director of Veterinary Services, Central Provinces and Berar.

READ2 the previous six years. The number immunized by this method during the year was 653,954 and over a million doses were issued. There can be no doubt that the experiments have furnished a potent yet cheap weapon to fight the disease, and the Provincial Government take this opportunity of expressing once more their thanks to the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research for their assistance. 3.After the close of the year a new scheme has been initiated to check the spread of infection by cattle herds imported from outside the Province. In accordance with the provisions of the Central Provinces Cattle Diseases Act, passed in 1934, quarantine stations have been established along some of the main cattle routes. Government will watch with great interest the working of this scheme, and the success it achieves in arrest- ing the spread of cattle disease. 4.In other directions also research has been carried out as best as the limited laboratory accommodation and scanty finan- cial resources of the Province permitted. For the first time the workers in the Province have succeeded in identifying the Rhinosporidiosis and Eimeriasmithi parasites. The former is responsible for nasal polypi in men as well as bovines, and its identification opens up an important field of research. The latter produces coccidiosis. The investigations during the last two years have demonstrated the wide prevalence of tuberculosis amongst the dairy cattle and further research is being carried on These facts are ample evidence of the value of research in cattle diseases. The urgent need of the Province is a well-equipped and fully staffed laboratory and it can be safely premised that the expenditure on research will be recouped a hundredfold in the value of lives saved. 5.On the curative side also there was gratifying expansion of the activities of the Department. The number of dispensaries remained unchanged, viz., 104, but the work done by them showed a notable increase. The total number of cases treated at the dispensaries, including castrations and medicines supplied, rose from 271,186 to 301,011, the corresponding figures for work done on tour being 704,328 and 766,287. Practically all the outbreaks were attended to, though on account of meagreness of staff in large number of cases the Veterinary Assistant could reach the affected areas only after the lapse of several days. Although these figures testify to the increasing use made by the public of the services of the dispensaries, Government is fully aware that the relief provided falls far short of the needs of the Province. Financial stringency does not permit of establish- ment of more dispensaries of the standard type, so the experi- ment of opening outlying dispensaries in charge of compounders
3 was initiated during the year, and the reports bear out the expectations of their usefulness to the rural population. 6.With a view to systematizing measures for improving the quality of local herds, District Livestock Associations were established during the year and 85 bulls issued. Government hope that the associations will steadily widen their field of activity and awaken interest in cattle husbandry, which is perhaps the most pressing problem of Indian agriculture. 7.Government's thanks are due to the officers of the Department for their good work during the year. Mr. J. S. Garewal held charge of the Department till the afternoon of the 29th March 1938, when his services were placed at the disposal of the Government of the Punjab. Mr. J. C. McDougall, the Director of Agriculture, was then placed in charge of this Department in addition to his other duties, and Government desire to record their appreciation of the efficient manner in which he has acquitted himself in his unfamiliar and onerous charge. ORDER.No. 2271-1-3 FROM J. C. McDOUGALL, ESQ., M.A., B.Sc. (Edin.), I.A.S., DIRECTOR OF AGRICULTURE, IN CHARGE VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, CENTRAL PROVINCES AND BERAR To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT, CENTRAL PROVINCES AND BERAR. Nagpur, the 19th October 1938. SIR, I have the honour to submit herewith the Annual Report on the working of the Civil Veterinary Depart- ment, Central Provinces and Berar, for the year ending the 31st March 1938. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, J. C. McDOUGALL, Director of Agriculture, In Charge Veterinary Department, Central Provinces & Berar.
ANNUAL REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT CENTRAL PROVINCES AND BERAR [For the year ending the 31st March 1938] 1.Mr. J. S. Garewal, I.V.S., held charge of the department till the afternoon of the 29th March 1938, when his services were placed at the disposal of the Government of the Punjab. He toured in all the districts of the province and inspected 49 dispensaries. He attended the Cattle Conference in Simla in May 1937 and also the meetings of the Advisory Board of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research at New Delhi in November 1937. 2.Mr. J. C. McDougall assumed charge of the department from the 29th March 1938, afternoon. 3.Mr. P. S. Nair officiated as Deputy Director of Veterinary Services till the 8th August 1937. During that period he toured in Bilaspur, Raipur, Bhandara, Balaghat, Chhindwara and Wardha districts, and inspect- ed 12 dispensaries. On his reversion he was put in charge of the Animal Husbandry Section as the perma- nent incumbent Mr. J. V. Takle was on leave. During this period he visited three farms and 13 breeding centres. 4.Rai Bahadur R. V. Pillai, Deputy Director, re- turned from eight months leave on the 9th August 1937 and remained at Nagpur till the 30th November 1937, when he was transferred to Jubbulpore division. Dur- ing this short period he inspected two dispensaries in Nagpur division. He joined at Jubbulpore on the 7th December 1937 and inspected 10 dispensaries in that division. 5.Mr. Bachan Singh continued to work as Veteri- nary Investigation Officer throughout the year and super- vised the work of the goat virus staff. The goat virus vaccination scheme financed by the Imperial Council of 1
2 Agricultural Research for a period of three years ended on the 15th March 1938. The Veterinary Investigation Officer carried out investigations into the blood proto- zoan and bacterial diseases, parasitic affections in cattle and poultry diseases and trematode infection in fish, etc. A detailed report regarding his work has been submitted to the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research. 6.Mr. J. V. Takle, Extra-Assistant Director, Animal Husbandry, proceeded on four months leave from the 10th August 1937. He rejoined on the 10th December 1937. He inspected three farms and 10 breed- ing centres. 7.Mr. S. S. Ayer, who was officiating as Assistant Director of Veterinary Services, Nagpur division, reverted to his substantive post of Veterinary Inspector from the forenoon of the 11th December 1937. Mr. K. B. Pillai, who was appointed as officiating Assistant Director of Veterinary Services, Jubbulpore division, reverted to his substantive post of Veterinary Inspector, with effect from the 7th December 1937, as one post of the Assistant Director of Veterinary Services was kept in abeyance. 8.Mr. Balbir Singh, M.R.C.V.S., was confirmed as Assistant Director of Veterinary Services, with effect from the 3rd August 1937. I.-VETERINARY INSTRUCTION 9.No new scholarships tenable at the Bombay Veterinary College were awarded during the year under report. Out of seven scholars studying at the Bombay Veterinary College in the final year class, three passed and joined the department. Six of the eight candidates of the second year passed the annual examination and were promoted to the final year class, and one was detain- ed for a supplementary examination to be held in October 1937. 10.Compounders' classes were opened at all the district headquarter dispensaries during the year under report. Twenty-eight candidates joined the classes and 20 passed the prescribed test and were awarded certifi- cates.
3 II4 addition to this 580,580 doses both of blood and tissue virus were distributed from the divisional headquarter centres, viz., Raipur, Jubbulpore and Amraoti. 134 passages of the virus obtained from the Imperial Veteri- nary Research Institute, Muktesar, about July 1938, were completed by the close of March 1938 and the virus was found to be active. It will be realized from the above statistics that the outturn in this direction is very large, The volume of work requires additional staff. Distribution of sera and vaccines.5 Attention was paid to the cases of nasal granuloma and coccidiosis which were treated with antimosan and carbon tetra-chloride, respectively. The patients were from the Government cattle-breeding farm, Telinkheri. Experiments were conducted to determine a safe system of immunization against spirochetosis in poultry ; liver emulsions prepared in different ways were tried. Further work is necessary on these lines to arrive at results of any importance. 13.Rhinosporidiosis was confirmed in three bovines and it is of interest to note that this parasite appears to have been identified for the first time in the province. It is a vegetable parasite allied to the fungi. The orga- nism generally produces nasal polypi in man, and, there- fore, its incidence in bovines is of far-reaching importance. The disease prevails in the backward tracts specially in the Chanda district and Chhattisgarh division and careful research on this condition, which will be undertaken by the Laboratory during the next year, is likely to prove of value. 14.Observations on cancer of the horn were conti- nued but so far no definite data in regard to the infectivity of this condition has been obtained. 2. CONTAGIOUS DESEASES. 15.Bovine.6 encouraging. It is expected that in due course this system of immunization will predominate over all the others, being very cheap. 17. The total number of animals protected against rinderpest by the different methods was as follows : 7 and those in contact, combined with hygienic precautions, were taken to check the disease and only three animals succumbed in the twenty-five outbreaks. 23.Piroplasmosis.8 30.Rabies.9 5. BREEDING OPERATIONS 38.The noteworthy feature of the year under report with regard to cattle-breeding operations was the transfer of the control of Telenkheri, Bod, Pakariya and Garhi cattle-breeding farms from the Agriculture to the Veterinary Department with effect from the 1st April 1937. The Extra-Assistant Director, in charge Animal Husbandry, and his staff were also transferred to this department. The strength of the Sahiwal herd of the Telinkheri farm was 114 [132] and the buffalo herd was 67 [68]. During the year eight Sahiwal cows and 25 buffalo-cows completed their full lactation period and the average milk yield per cow worked out at 3,410 [4,137] lbs., while that of the buffalo herd was 2,837 [3,526] lbs. During the year under review only one bull of Sahiwal breed was sold for breeding purposes. From the Garhi farm where the Gaolao breed is maintained, 13 bulls were sold during the year for breed- ing purposes. At this farm much improvement in lay- out of the cultivated area was made by levelling old bandhis and making new ones to check the washing out of the fertile material. A new area of about two acres of land below the small tank was brought under cultivation and clover and oats were raised under irrigation from the tank. From the Pakariya farm 22 bulls of Malvi breed were issued for breeding purposes in the Chhattisgarh division. The strength of the herd of the Bod farm at the end of the year was 358. Seventeen cows, 12 heifers, six bull- calves and two young calves were sold from the farm. An improvement in increasing the breeding capacity in cows has been effected at this farm and the calves dropped by them now are heavier and bigger in size. Poultry farm.10 district of the province and funds were collected by the Revenue Department. Sixty-one bulls were purchased from the Government of India grant and distributed to the different cattle-breeding centres in the province. In addition to these 24 bulls were purchased from the Dis- trict Livestock Association funds. 39.Nine cattle fairs and shows were held in the different parts of the province and camp veterinary dispensaries were opened by the staff. Lectures on veterinary subjects supplemented by practical demon- stration were delivered with the aid of magic lanterns at these shows and fairs. III.11 virus vaccination financed by the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research ceased to function from the 15th March 1938. The scheme proved a great success in establishing that goat virus vaccination is very effective and a cheaper method than the ordinary serum alone method. 45.The activities in cattle-breeding side of the de- partment continued on the same lines as was under Agriculture Department except in approving a number of privately owned bulls for breeding purposes. The staff was able to emasculate 166,129 scrub bulls. 46.The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals organization, both in Jubbulpore and Nagpur, received full support from the department. 47.The number of cases treated in the dispensaries shows a steady increase12 TABLE SPECIAL A.- Statement showing the positive findings from the smears and specimens Kind of animal Protozoological Piropls- mosis P. gibsoni P. canis T. mutans Trypa- noso- miasis (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) Equines ... 13 ... ... ... 77 Bovines ... 325 ... ... 126 50 Ovines ... 7 ... ... ... ...

READ2 4.Government regrets to note that during the year under report there was no improvement so far as the health of the cattle population and incidence of disease were concerned. The total number of outbreaks reported and detected was 10,422 [10,212]. This was largely due to the prevalence of foot-and- mouth disease, rinderpest, and haemorrhagic septicaemia. Although the number of outbreaks of rinderpest was less than during the previous year, the mortality was slightly greater. Government is pleased to note that the method of immunization by goat virus vaccination continues to be popular. The total number of animals vaccinated by this method, however, under- went a heavy fall from 653,950 to 296,656, for which the closing down of the Goat Virus Vaccination Scheme and the smaller number of rinderpest outbreaks are partly responsible. 5.On the curative side, two more ordinary and six out- lying dispensaries were established. Government regrets that financial stringency prevented the full programme for establish- ing outlying dispensaries from being implemented. The total number of cases treated at dispensaries, including castrations and cases supplied with medicines, rose from 301,011 to 305,548. The corresponding figure for work done on tour was 441,080 [750,839]. The fall in the volume of work done on tour is attri- buted to modifications in the method of computing figures and, so far as castrations were concerned, to the effects of the inten- sive campaign in previous years. 6.Government wishes to place on record its thanks to the officers of the department and specially to Mr. J. C. McDougall, the Director of Veterinary Services, who shouldered the onerous duties of his combined charge with devotion and industry. ORDER.No. 1455-1-3 FROM J. C. McDOUGALL, ESQ., M.A., B.SC.

Blackquarter.9 28.Rhinosporidiosis.10 serum, fowl cholera vaccine, or simultaneous injections of serum and vaccine. 2,240 [1,396] inoculations were performed. Spirochætosis cases were treated with soamin sulfersenol. One outbreak of fowlpox was detected and 23 birds were protected with fowlpox vaccine supplied by the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Muktesar. The disease was detected at the onset, and the vaccination brought the outbreak immediately under control. III.11 The total cultivable area was increased from 46 to 52 acres during the year and much improvement in this area was affected by putting small bunds across the slopes and checking the course of a nallah running into the fields. The orchard laid out two years ago continued to make good progress. 42.Land improvement work on the Bod farm was undertaken. One acre of land in reserve forest area was cleared of forest growth and a crop of clover was raised under well irrigation. The strength of the herd at the close of the year was 348 [358]. Ten pairs of young bullocks were supplied to other Government farms. 43.On the recommendation of the Livestock Improvement Sub-Committee of the Animal Husbandry Wing meeting held at Madras in December 1936, the Provincial Government was pleased to open a sheep- breeding farm at Dhar in Betul district as an experimental measure. An agricultural Jamadar was trained in the management of sheep at Hissar Government Cattle Farm. Three rams and two male lambs of the Bikaner breed, and three rams and two male lambs of Hissardale breed were purchased from the Government Cattle Farm, Hissar. 300 young local selected ewes and two rams were purchased locally. 44.Poultry farming.12 Government of India grant or donated. A lot of inten- sive propaganda through the District Livestock Associa- tions is necessary to foster a real live interest in cattle improvement. Forty-one bulls issued under the premium bull scheme were functioning during the year. IV.13 V.14 passed through the individual stations is detailed below:15 of the nine quarantine stations for the first four months amounted to Rs. 6,218 against receipts amounting to Rs. 10,501. Practical experience has shown that the Act requires amending in some respects. The necessary draft amend- ments will be submitted to Government in due course. VII.TABLE I

No. 1974-1877-X GOVERNMENT OF THE CENTRAL PROVINCES AND BERAR AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT Nagpur, the 6th December 1940. READ2 5. Government wishes to place on record its thanks to the officers of the Department and specially to Mr. J. C. McDougall, the Director of Veterinary Services, who continued to discharge the duties of his combined charge with his usual zeal and devotion. ORDER.ANNUAL REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, CENTRAL PROV- INCES AND BERAR, FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH 1940 [Figures under paranthesis indicate last year's figures.] I held charge of the department from the 1st April till the 23rd June 1939 and again, on return from leave, from the 21st October till the end of the year. Mr. R. H. Hill held charge during my absence. 2.Rai Bahadur R. V. Pillai, G.B.V.C., Deputy Director, was in charge of the Jubbulpore Division throughout the year He toured for 120 days and inspected all the 27 dispensaries and the nine quarantine stations in his division and checked the work of the staff in 70 villages. He also inspected a number of the herds which had been vaccinated at the quarantine stations with a view to ascertain the extent of the reaction to vaccination. He attended the meeting of the Animal Husbandry Wing of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research held at Delhi in December 1939 and the Agricultural and Industrial Exhibition held at Harda. 3.Mr. Bachan Singh, M.R.C.V.S., continued to hold the post of Veterinary Disease Investigation Officer throughout the year under report except for the period from the 26th April to the 19th July 1939 when he was on leave. He toured for 96 days and visited 67 villages, 27 tahsil towns, three Government cattle farms, one gourakshan, and one private dairy. He undertook preliminary investigation on diseases of cattle, sheep and goats, and poultry. Important findings were the detection of Rhinosporidiosis in a cow, Bacillus melitensis infection in a goat as the cause of abortion, and deficiency disease resembling rickets in a fowl. The pathogenicity of Emeria smithi a new variety of coccidia, has been established in a number of cases in cattle and buffaloes. Details of his work are embodied in his annual report submitted to Government and the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research. 4.Mr. J. V. Takale, L.Ag., Extra-Assistant Director, was in charge of the Animal Husbandry Section throughout the year. He inspected all the cattle breeding farms and the experimental sheep farm at Dhar.

He also attended the Agriculture and Cattle Show held at Garhi farm in January 1940, and he delivered lectures on animal hus- bandry subjects at the Refresher Course held at Chandkhuri for officers of the Revenue, Irrigation and Agriculture Departments
2 5. Mr. P. S. Nair, G.B.V.C., Assistant Director, was at- tached to the office of the Director of Veterinary Services throughout the year under report. He was in charge of the Vete- rinary laboratory in addition to his other duties till the 20th Nov- ember 1939. He toured for 46 days and inspected 32 dispensaries in Berar and Chhattisgarh Divisions. He also attended the nine- teenth meeting of the Advisory Board of Agriculture held at Simla in May. 6. Mr. S. S. Ayer, G.B.V.C, was in charge of Nagpur Division till the 11th June 1939 when he proceeded on four months' leave preparatory to retirement. He toured for eight days and inspected one dispensary. 7. Mr. Balbir Singh, M.Sc, M.R.C.V.S., whose services had been placed at the disposal of the Director, Imperial Vete- rinary Research Institute, Mukteswar, reverted to the province on the 29th September and was in charge of Nagpur Division until the 21st November, during which period he toured for 12 days and inspected two dispensaries. Thereafter, he was transferred to the charge of the Veterinary Laboratory, Nagpur, where he continued till the end of the year. 8. Mr. K. B. Pillay, G.B.V.C, continued to officiate as Assistant Director, Chhattisgarh Division, throughout the year. He toured for 211 days and inspected all the 35 dispensaries in his division except one. He checked the work of the staff in 165 villages. 9. Mr. P. S. Sundram Pillay, G.B.V.C, continued to offi- ciate as Assistant Director, Berar Division, throughout the year.

Sanyal, G.B.V.C, Veterinary Inspector, officiated as Assistant Director in charge of Nagpur Division from the 21st June until the 29th September, and again from the 21st November until the end of the financial year. He toured for 81 days and inspected all the 24 dispensaries of his division. 11. Subordinate establishment.3 13. Compounders' training classes were held at Nagpur, Jubbulpore, Raipur and Amraoti divisional headquarter dis- pensaries and thirty-nine students were admitted. Thirty-four passed the prescribed course and were awarded certificates; three left the class and two failed to qualify. 14. Mr. G. D. Pani, Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, attach- ed to the Veterinary Laboratory, was deputed to a three months' post-graduate course at Mukteswar. II.4 Nature of disease Specimens confirmed Protozoological findings5 Nature of disease Specimens confirmed Fungiological findings (1) Trychophyton mentagrophytes... 7 (2) Trychophyton and tick infection 1* Urine test (1) Albuminuria 2 (2) Haemoglobinuria 1 Milk test with &quot;Bromothymol blue&quot; for mastitis was carried out and three cases out of eight were confirmed. This solution was supplied to all divisional officers and the Disease Investiga- tion Officer for carrying out the test in the field as per recom- mendation made by the Imperial Veterinary Conference, 1938. Some interesting specimens were added to the laboratory museum. These include a dog's spleen with three large tumours. The Deputy Director of Veterinary Services, Jubbulpore, and the Assistant Directors at Raipur and Amraoti also carried out microscopical examination of blood smears and their find- ings are as follows: 6 In addition to goat virus vaccine, the following sera and vac- cines were distributed:7 20. Black quarter.8 34. Rabies.9 46. Garhi cattle-breeding farm.10 50. The sheep-breeding farm at Dhar in Betul district which was opened as an experimental measure last year did not fare well. Deaths began to occur in May and there was a very high mortality rate throughout the year. Seventy-four out of the original stock of 300 ewes died, and only 13 per cent of the lambs born survived. Specific diseases, viz., haemorrhagic sep- ticaemia, anthrax, coccidiosis and liverfluke infection contributed to the death rate; other contributing causes were that the neces- sity for regulating the lambing season was not fully appreciated and that no silage fodder was provided for the dry season. The lock was inspected by me in February and orders were issued for its immediate transfer to Powarkheda farm as a temporary measure. Since then its condition has improved very consider- ably. It will return to Dhar during the rains. Its present strength is 300, including rams and lambs. 51. Poultry farming.11 veterinary assistant surgeons were supplied with medicines. On tour, 421,241 (441,080) cases, including castrations were attended to by the staff. 55. Buildings.12 60. The total direct running cost of the nine quarantine sta- tions during the nine working months was Rs. 18,105-4-0 against an income of Rs. 29,281-4-0 from fees which leaves a saving of Rs. 11,176. The success of the stations in their first full working year appears to be ample justification for extending the scheme to other districts as rapidly as may be possible. Proposals in this connection are being framed. VII.TABLE I

The total receipts realized during the year from the nine quarantine stations amounted to Rs. 27,359-10-3 and the direct running cost of these stations was Rs. 15,854-4-3, leaving thereby a saving of Rs. 11,505-6-0. Though it is yet too early to assess the value of these stations in respect of the control of contagious diseases, particularly rinderpest, it may be stated on the basis of the available statistics for the last two years that the incidence of contagious diseases has been appreciably reduced in the areas receiving their supplies through these stations. This feature has thus meant a distinct relief to cattle owners of these tracts, which were previously suffering enormous losses due to cattle epidemics every year. The question of extension of the Cattle Diseases Act to Nimar, Jubbulpore and Mandla districts is under examination and plans are in progress to locate strategic sites for controlling the ingress of infection imported with the influx of cattle from the north, north-east and north-west of the Province. The proposal to keep the quarantine stations open throughout the year, with a view to mitigate the hardship now experienced by cattle dealers in some areas during the non-working season of the quarantine stations, is also receiving consideration. V.13 urban and semi-urban areas with a view to improve the milk yield of the progeny. The strength of the Sahiwal stock at the close of the year was 136 [112] and there were 75 [72] Murrah buffaloes. The average milk yield per animal has reached 3,615 lb. as against 2,000 lb. per year of the original foundation stock. The Murrah buffaloes have not, however, responded equally satisfactorily in spite of the best attention and husbandry. Their average yield still remains 2,240 lb. which is rather a low production for the breed. During the year under report 173,437 lb. of milk [145,171 lb] was produced at the farm of which 21,161 lb. was utilized for feed- ing the calves and the balance of 152,276 lb. was disposed as fluid milk. Except for the months of February and March when a few animals contracted foot-and-mouth disease, the herd remained healthy throughout the year. Three Sahiwal and 11 Murrah buffalo bulls were sold during the year. The Telenkheri Dairy Co-operative Society, which has been in existence for the last 29 years, had a successful working year. This organization caters for the dairy requirements of a substantial proportion of the Nagpur public and its activities are guided and partly supervised by the departmental staff. The strength of the Society herd at the close of the year was 736. The turnover during the year was 910,564 lb. of milk of which 809,334 lb. was sold as fluid milk, and the rest, viz., 101,230 lb. was disposed as butter or ghee. 56. Garhi cattle-breeding farm.14 young bulls could be sold this year. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia and Black Quarter infection appeared at the farm during the year but were promptly suppressed. A moharir of the Indagaon Cattle- Breeding Farm, who was deputed by the Court of Wards, Bindra Nawagarh Estate, received practical training for two months in farm practices and cattle management. This farm has also served as a demonstration centre for improved agricultural practices and supplied 1,102 lb. of improved seeds. The orchard is progressing satis- factorily and citrus and peaches, worth Rs. 42-14-3, have been sold for the first time this year. 58. Bod cattle-breeding farm.15 yielders. Further, on account of the failure of crops the feeding has also not been entirely satisfactory and this has reflected adversely on milk yield. With a view to reduce the expenditure on feeding, an area of. about 14.8 acres of land has been further brought under cultivation and 1,000 acres have been reserved for grazing. 60. The experimental sheep-breeding farm at Dhar in the Betul district has progressed satisfactorily. The strength of the flock at the close of the year was 395 [314]. The breeding pro- gramme, which consists of selective grading of the indigenous stock and cross-breeding with Bikaner and Hissar Dale rams, was syste- matically followed. Matings were effected during June and July and of the total of 215 ewes put to rams, 180 were successfully covered. Lambing commenced in November and continued till the end of December 1940, and in all 178 lambs (including 167 dropped by the 180 ewes referred to above) were born during the year. Washing and shearing operations were conducted in April and October. The wool produced at this farm was sold to the provincial textile expert who has observed in respect of the quality &quot; that a great improvement has been effected in the staple and feel of the wool as compared with the wool supplied in previous years &quot;. 61. Poultry farming.16 year being 10,352 [13,501]. There was a balance of 231 eggs from the last year's account and 72 were purchased during the year, thus bringing the total to 10,655 eggs. The disposal of eggs during the year was as follows:17 VII.18 Gujarat and Sind. Quite a large number of male buffaloes is im- ported by road which find a market in the rice tract, particularly in the Chhattisgarh division, for cultivation purposes. In regard to the export trade, strictly speaking, this Province has no positive balance in its favour. It is only the imported surplus that leaves the Province as export. 65.

In general, it is noticed that the prices of hides, skins and wool have shown appreciable rise on account of the prevailing war conditions. VI I.TABLE No. I
