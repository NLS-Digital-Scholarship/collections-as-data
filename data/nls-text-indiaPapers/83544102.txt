REPORT ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL, BY The Committee appointed to inquire into Medical Expenditure in Bengal. Calcutta: PRINTED AT THE BENGAL SECRETARIAT PRESS. 1879.
REPORT ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. THE Committee having reported on the Medical Institutions of Calcutta, the proposed improvements at the Medical College Hospital, the supply of medi- cines to provincial dispensaries, the question of medical education at Sealdah and some minor points referred to them, next turned their attention to the subject of Lunatic Asylums. They had been specially asked to report on the system of accounts and the supply of food; but acting on the general instructions conveyed in paragraph 3 of the resolution appointing the Committee, they at first proposed to themselves to report fully on these institutions in the same way as they had done on the Calcutta Hospitals. A separate memorandum, showing the working of each asylum, was to be drawn up, and the report was to be based on the facts contained therein. It was soon found, however, that the new task was one of much greater difficulty than the former. As a preliminary to their enquiries, the reports and accounts of all the asylums since 1862 were carefully gone over and summarised. It was thought that a comparative view of the general working and of the expenditure of different institutions would thus easily be obtained: the asylum reports for years past having being very full and precise, and it being believed that for some years at least the accounts had been kept on a uniform system. The Committee have always been alive to the great danger of generalizing from imperfect data, and to the many sources of fallacy in figures and especially in averages taken in the gross and without due enquiry into their real bearing. They have repeatedly called attention to these points, and have been specially careful not to lay stress on statistics without the most careful analysis of them. In a recent report they wrote( 2 ) others have been found, while Dullunda is the only asylum as yet fully investigated( 3 ) ation, and have little (if any) bearing on the question of economy or extra- vagance ; but they must first give one or two more examples of the misleading nature of the printed figures. In the reports from 1862 to 1871 inclusive, the pay of the Superintendent of the Dullunda Asylum is not included, and the average for comparison with other asylums is calculated without this important item, while in all the other asylums, except Dacca in 1871, the Superintendent's pay is included. From 1872 to 1876 it appears in the accounts and averages, with the effect of enormously increasing the cost per patient at Dullunda under this head. In 1877 and 1878 it is again excluded, and although the omission is incidentally noticed in a foot- note, the usual comparative averages are again drawn without note or comment. In the same way the pay of the Superintendent at Dacca was omitted from the return of 1871, although this fact is not mentioned in the general report. At Dacca, again, in 1872 vegetables, milk, cocoanut and castor oil for use in the asylum were supplied gratis, and the cost for diet and lighting thereby reduced; whereas in the other asylums they were paid for as usual. In the statement of comparative cost for 1865, the total expenditure per patient at Cuttack is given at Rs. 47, that of the other asylums ranging from Rs. 76 to Rs. 112. No notice is taken of this great discrepancy in the general report, although the Superintendent himself provides at once an explanation and the means of furnishing the true figures. The result is arrived at by dividing the total expenditure by 48, the number of lunatics treated during the year, instead of by 25.3 the mean daily strength. The real cost per patient was Rs. 89-11 instead of Rs. 47-4-7. The Committee consider that no blame attaches to individuals for these errors, most of which are correct arithmetical statements, and only appear as blunders by juxtaposition with figures calculated on a different basis. Superin- tendents of asylums are not trained accountants and may easily fall into error when dealing with complicated accounts. For two of the mistakes two different members of the Committee are responsible, and the Secretary to the Committee was convicted of a somewhat similar mistake in the Sanitary Report for 1877. The mistakes have arisen from a want of uniformity in the system of accounts in different asylums and a too ready acceptance of unexplained figures. With a view to obviate this difficulty, a definite system was ordered to be introduced in 1872; but so late as 1874 the Surgeon-General writes, " the accounts are not fairly comparable with each other," although comparisons continued to be drawn; and the Committee will show that it is doubtful whether complete uniformity is even yet obtained.

The Com- mittee will, however, endeavour to compare the accounts for 1877 and 1878, and to explain the great differences and variations, real or apparent. Table I is compiled from those given in the reports for the two years, but the pay of the Superintendent at Dullunda has been added to the figures and averages for that asylum. The Committee will first take the different items of establish- ment, diet, &c., and will then consider the net cost as influenced by receipts from paying patients and profits in the manu- facturing departments. The first item is the cost of establishment and the figures are as noted in the margin. The differences appear at first sight very startling, and it would appear that, while Patna, Dacca, Berhampore, and Hazaribagh are, as regards establishment, economically managed, Cuttack and Dul- lunda are very extravagant. Table II, however, compiled from the annual re- ports, shows that so far as the question of the management is concerned, the inference would be entirely erroneous, the variations depending on the constitu- tion of the different establishments, which is to a great extent independent of

( 6 ) asylum control. The several establishments have been fixed by Government after due consideration. It will be seen that at four asylums( 7 ) yet the cost per patient is more than double. The reason is that Cuttack has only about a quarter of the number of patients under treatment at Patna. It seems to the Committee that any inferences drawn from relative cost must always be fallacious under such conditions, which, moreover, vary yearly. A comparison of the proportionate number of patients looked after by each keeper and servant is less misleading, but even here bare figures must be sup- plemented by a knowledge of the details of plan, buildings, watch and ward, and the character of the cases under treatment. Special keepers have some- times to be engaged for an individual case, and keepers, and especially head keepers, cannot be extemporised. If they are to fluctuate with every change of numbers good men cannot be retained. The present proportion of jemadars varies from 1 to 40 to 1 to 49 male patients, except at Dacca, where it is 1 to 32. But Dacca has only one jemadar more than Dullunda or Hazaribagh, and there may be some local reason for retaining him. At Cuttack there is but one for the whole asylum. He has nearly as many patients as he can manage, and the addition of a few more would necessitate the appointment of a second man, when the proportion would rise above that of any other asylum. Ratios given in the report. Corrected ratios. Dullunda ...... 1 to 6.7 Dacca 1 to 5.6 1 to 5.6 Patna 1 to 10.68 1 to 5.87 Cuttack 1 to 5.96 1 to 2.98 Berhampore 1 to 12.30 1 to 7.62 The ratios of female-keepers to women given in the report are entirely misleading. The figures given have probably been compiled by a clerk, and are correct arithmetical deductions from the number of " female-keepers" shown as such in the return. It is obvious, however, that what is wanted is a comparative statement of the establishment required for the female lunatics, and that the name by which the attendants are known is immaterial. Dullunda has no " female-keepers," but it has a matron and five female sweepers to attend to its female wards, and should have appeared in the table as having one female attendant to 6.7 women. The ratios given in the report and the correct ratios are noted in the margin, and show that the great apparent differences have no real existence, except in the case of Cuttack. Here, however, the daily strength of female lunatics is only 5.96, and there is only one keeper to look after them, and one female sweeper. In the opinion of the Committee, then, no just comparison of the relative cost for establishment is possible, and each asylum must be judged on its own merits, measured by its plan and other inherent circumstances. The numerical strength of the Patna and Berhampore Asylums is practically the same. Dacca is higher, the increase being chiefly in sweepers and keepers. So is Dullunda ; but with reference to this, Dr. Payne explains that he has several lunatics who could replace some of his asylum servants, but that, as they make more in the workshops than the pay of the servants, Government would lose and not gain by the transfer. So far as the Committee can judge, the establishment in all the asylums is moderate, but the compounder at Dullunda might, they think, be dispensed with.* The door-keepers are really guards, and the Committee are satisfied that they cannot be dipensed with.

Dullunda includes tobacco, sweetmeats, &c., under diet; other asylums debit them to contin- gencies. The expenditure as given in the official reports has been as noted in the margin during the last two years. The variations are extremely large, but they seem to the Committee to be almost entirely explainable by the difference in the local price of supplies. The year 1878 was one of extremely high prices every- where. The returns of all the asylums, except Cuttack and Dullunda, show this; but Dullunda was influenced by it also. The reduction would have been much greater than it is but for the extremely high rates ruling in Calcutta; yet it is not a real reduction, but only one of account. In former years the food was bought wholesale and in the rough, was husked, cleaned, ground, and prepared for use in the asylum, and charged for at the market price of the prepared article, the labour fund being credited with the difference. In 1878 only the price of raw material was debited to Government, the labour spent on preparing it being given gratis. The apparent saving in diet is balanced by the falling off in profits, and there is no real gain, although the fact furnishes yet another instance of the misleading nature of the figures when unexplained. At Dacca the expendi- ture on diet has fluctuated enormously of late years, but the differences correspond very closely with the variations in the bazar prices. A diagram has been prepared, which shows this very clearly, and the Committee are satisfied that Dr. Crombie's explanation of the excessive cost of diet last year is sufficient. Efforts were made to reduce the cost by some small changes in the dietary, but as they led to loss of weight in the patients, they were very properly dis- continued. At Dacca, too, very few things were made over to the asylum free of charge. The articles were sold to the contractor and re-sold by him to the asylum, producing a precisely opposite effect to that noticed at Dullunda: the cost of diet increasing and the profits increasing too. A similar explanation applies to the figures of the other asylums. The accompanying diagram shows the cost per patient in rupees, and the average price of common rice at all the asylums, and the two curves correspond very closely on the whole, the chief variations being in Dullunda, where they are due to changes of diet not connected with the price of rice. The price of other articles varies even more than that of rice, as is shown in the table in the margin taken from the report for 1878, and it is quite impossible to make such an approximately correct estimate of the comparative cost as would allow of inference as to economy or the reverse on the part of Superintendents. What the diagram does show is that the great differences in different asylums, and the great variations in the cost of diet in the same asylum during different years, are for the most part accounted for. There are, however, other conditions, one of which is the difference in the quality of food supplied. In the resolution on the report for 1877, it was remarked that, while the diet of each lunatic cost Rs. 57 at Dullunda and only Rs. 36 at BerhamporeCompiled from the Asylum Reports and the Price List of Food-Grains, just issued from the Statistical Department of the Bengal Secretariat.

( 9 ) to be of the best quality only, an order which has been interpreted in so liberal a spirit that most of the patients have always been fed far better than they had been accustomed to at home, a statement borne out by numerous references in the reports. Another source of variation is the want of uniformity in the diet scales. These vary in each asylum according to the nature of the food in common use in the district. They are given below in a table taken from the Surgeon-General's report for 1878 :( 10 ) The following table shows the component parts of the full diet which has been in use at different times since 1856.

Dr. Payne did not consider this to be due to scurvy, and " did not consider the dietary defective," but on Dr. Saunders' recommendation, a daily ration of four ounces of meat was substituted for the fish ration, the allowance of rice being slightly diminished, and an ounce of ghee added. Of this diet Dr. Payne writes that " it is more ample and more complete than in any other institution, and contains everything that can be thought useful." He also remarks( 12 ) Dr. Payne is convinced that it is in every way sufficient, and the general appear- ance of the patients seems to prove it to be so. The Committee can testify from personal knowledge that the lunatics at Dullunda are amply fed with excellent well-cooked food. 1877. 1878. A A P. A. P.

The largest sum debitable under this head in any other asylum is Rs. 1-8 at Patna, and Rs. 1-6 at Hazaribagh in 1877; but in most asylums the charge does not exceed a few annas. The chief items making up the Dullunda contingent bill in 1878 were replacing iron arbours destroyed by a storm, and originally provided from garden profits, Rs. 1,078 ; iron roof over pumps, Rs. 174; fitting and supplying water-pipes, Rs. 435; shower-bath in female ward, Rs. 211. The Superintendents of provincial asylums, when asked how such charges would be met, had some difficulty in replying. One said he would apply to the Public Works Department; another, that they would be met from manufacturing profits (in which case the expenditure would not appear in the pub- lished accounts); but most were of opinion that they would be chargeable to con- tingencies. No such expenditure seems, however, to have been incurred. One Superintendent writes that he has no iron arbours ; another that he should never think of anything so ambitious ; while, as regards shower-baths, one says that " ghurras of water are drawn from the well and thrown over the patient." It is evident that there is no corresponding item in the contingent bills of provincial asylums. It may be freely admitted that all the items quoted are not absolute necessaries. It is probable that the costly iron arbours would never have been sanctioned had sanction been required; but they were originally built and paid for out of industrial profits, at a time when the profits were devoted to the improvement of the asylums at the discretion of the Superintendents, a system put a stop to by Sir George Campbell. The arbours, moreover, serve as shelter stations for guards in the daytime and are placed with reference to this object. The water-pipes and shower-baths were duly sanctioned, in conse- quence of the important discovery that much of the heavy mortality for which Dullunda was formerly notorious was due to the lunatics using water contaminated by having been used for bathing and other purposes; and the effect of the changes introduced has been to reduce the death-rate below the average of English asylums, and to entirely eliminate dysentery, which was one of the chief causes of mortality. There is great need of similar arrange- ments in several of the provincial asylums ; but, if carried out, the cost will probably be borne and the work done by the Public Works Department. The only other point which seems to call for explanation is the great excess in contingencies at Patna as compared with other provincial asylums, especially Dacca and Berhampore. The explanation is at once forthcoming when sought for. Ground rent, which does not appear in the accounts of any other asylum, comes to Rs. 194-10 in 1877 and Rs. 713-15 in 1878; sweet- meats and rum are charged to contingencies instead of to diet, and so on. Clothing.( 14 ) in spite of misgivings," elsewhere, that 165 out of 207 lunatics had been con- stantly employed throughout the year, and the value of the work done by them was estimated at Rs. 6,160. The sole object for which regular and systematic work was introduced was the physical welfare and mental discipline of the patients, and it was shown that the work had had a good, instead of a bad, effect upon the lunatics. Twenty-four deaths occurred among the 165 employed per- sons, and 27 among the 44 who were unemployed. The sums realized were with the consent of Government devoted to the improvement of the asylum and its grounds, and of the general comfort of the unfortunate inmates. The system thus inaugurated has made steady progress, and out of the profits of the labour fund the asylum has lost its original prison-like features; has supplied itself with extensive and expensive work-rooms and store-rooms, tanks and baths and arbours, a model dead-house and refectory and the most perfect cooking arrangements in any Indian institution known to the Committee. Its industrial system has been the model followed in all the provincial asylums and its cooking and latrine arrangements have been extensively adopted in institutions of other kinds. Up to 1872 the labour funds remained at the absolute discretion of the Superintendents, who carried out such improvements as they thought best in their own way. The majority of those mentioned had already been completed at Dullunda, where work was introduced earlier than elsewhere ; but in the younger asylums no great progress had been made. In that year a material change was made in the whole system of accounts. A Committee appointed by Sir George Campbell recommended that all money received should be paid into, and all money spent be drawn from, the treasury, and that all expenditure should be regularly budgeted for. The discretionary power of Superintendents was abolished, except within a limit of Rs. 200 on manufacturing account, and the sanction of Government had to be obtained for all future improvements. The change, although no doubt a wise measure in many ways, was an unfortunate one for the asylums, for the period of financial pressure which followed put a stop to many improvements still incomplete. This system is still in force. It has the advantage of showing the accounts of individual asylums with almost absolute exactness as to their total and net cost to Government, and it prevents unsanctioned expenditure. The accounts show on the credit side cash received for sales, the value of articles supplied for asylum use, the value of raw material and manufactured articles in stock, and of the machinery and plant at the end of the year. On the debit side is the amount spent in the purchase of raw material, on manufacture buildings, tools, &c., and the value of raw materials, manufactured articles, plant and machinery at the beginning of the year. Ten per cent. is allowed for depreciation of machinery, and a balance of the two accounts shows the actual profit or loss on the year's transactions so far as Government is concerned. Vouchers are duly furnished for every item on each side of the account, and the amount of the profits is deducted from the general expenditure of the asylum in calculating the net cost of the institution and of each patient. As the transactions of each year are complete, the figures give with perfect arithmetical precision the net and gross cost to Government of each institution for each year. It is obvious, however, that from such figures no correct inferences can be drawn as to the relative merit of different institutions, or as to their respective success in manufactures. The sums shown in the accounts as " profits" represent correctly the excess of receipts over expenditure on account of manufacture during the particular year, but in no sense represent the asylum profits for that year. If, on the 31st of December, an asylum has a thousand rupees worth of manufactured goods more than it had on the 1st of January, it is clear that its manufacturing profits are a thousand rupees more than the admitted profits; and although this sum is rightly excluded from the Govern- ment account, since Government has not yet been credited with it, it is clear that it must be taken into account in comparing the industrial accounts of one asylum with those of another. If an asylum has managed to pay for extensive work-sheds or elaborate machinery out of its manufacture receipts, it is evident that, though the money is not gained to Government, since it has been spent, it has been gained by the asylum and should be allowed for in estimating the value of work done, as compared with other asylums which may have spent nothing on similar items. It has already been shown that Dacca Asylum sells
( 15 ) all its manufactured goods to a contractor, and buys them back from him for asylum use. Other asylums do the same; whereas Dullunda, Berhampore, and Hazaribagh make them over without intermediary. The consequence is that the amount drawn from the treasury at Dacca on account of diet is greatly in excess of that drawn at Dullunda, and the industrial receipts at Dacca are largely swollen in this way. This particular point, it is true, does not, apart from the system of charging a profit on such items, affect the total profits ; but it shows that the figures given in the reports require analysis, and cannot be used as they stand to support inferences. Yet such inferences have been frequently drawn. It was arithmetically a correct inference from certain figures given in the annual report that the outturn of work at Dacca was very poor com- pared to that at Dullunda. The figures given were, however, incorrect; and it was shown that, had the correct ones been used, the very opposite inference would have to be drawn, viz. that Dacca earned Rs. 15 and Dullunda only Rs. 7-5 per employed patient. This latter inference, though absolutely faultless as a deduction from figures in themselves absolutely correct, would be even more incorrect than the former. The admitted " profits " of any two asylums are in truth not comparable, and it is only by an elaborate analysis of the detailed accounts that any just comparison of the relative amount of work and profits in different asylums can be drawn. Table No. XI, page 49 of the general Report for 1876, is incomplete and the true relation between the work done at Dullunda and Dacca in that year cannot be ascertained. The figures for Dullunda have been investigated and found to be correct (except that the amounts in columns 10 and 12 should be transposed). From these it appears that the " profits" at Dullunda were Rs. 1,812-11. But in addition to this, there was an increase of Rs. 1,354-4-6 in the value of raw material in store, and of no less than Rs. 6,459-9-9 in plant and machinery ; while there was a decrease of Rs. 1,176-5-6 in the value of manufactured articles in store, the net result being that the manufacture account showed an actual profit to the asylum of Rs. 8,450-3-9 instead of Rs. 1,812 only. The profits at Dacca are put at Rs. 2,420-10-7; but the account is quite unintelligible, although accurately balanced. Nothing is shown as expended on raw material, yet there is an increase of Rs. 354 in the value of raw material on 31st December as compared with 1st January, and credit is taken for Rs. 3,847-6-4 for articles sold and Rs. 408 for goods supplied to the asylum. It seems clear that the profits have been put too high. The Superintendent was communicated with, and his reply is given as a foot-note. It leaves the account as obscure as before, and serves to illustrate the difficulties which the committee have met with in their attempts to clear up doubtful points. The two following tables, the first of which is taken from the Surgeon-General's reports, and the second compiled from the first, show clearly the relation of asylum industrial profits to Govern- ment and to each other during the last two years. No. 269, dated Dacca, the 16th August 1879. From( 16 ) TABLE III. Manufacture Accounts of the Lunatic Asylums in Bengal for 1877 and 1878, compiled from Surgeon-General's Reports. Year. 1.( 17 ) They show not only that Dullunda is far in advance of the other asylums in regard to its real profits, but also that its industrial system is far more highly developed than that of the others. This is no doubt in part due to the better market which the metropolis affords for the ready and quick sale of manufac- tured articles. With a working population only twelve in excess of that of Dacca, its cash receipts for articles sold were in 1878 Rs. 18,926 against Rs. 6,315, while it made over for asylum use goods valued at Rs. 6,882 against Rs. 36. In addition to this, it added during the year Rs. 618 to the value of its store of raw material, Rs. 688 to its stock of manufactured articles, and Rs. 3,437 to its plant and machinery; while Dacca shows a falling off under each of these heads, amounting in the aggregate to Rs. 340. The net result is that the profits at Dullunda are raised from Rs. 1,513 to Rs. 6,258; while those at Dacca fall from Rs. 3,923 to Rs. 3,582. The net earnings per employed patient are thus Rs. 34 at Dullunda and Rs. 20 at Dacca( 18 ) IV.( 19 ) writing and drawing materials, games, &c., were sanctioned, as well as tools and other material for male and female industry. It was arranged that, so far as European-born lunatics were concerned, the asylum was to be a temporary re- sidence merely. If after six months they showed no signs of amendment they were to be transferred to Europe, and 12 months was to be the maximum limit of their stay in the asylum. Subordinate officers.

The subordinate establishment was as noted in the margin, the first six being Europeans, the rest natives. The system of treatment was that of non-restraint, but during the early part of 1856, in consequence of the full esta- blishment not being available, mechanical restraint could not be entirely avoided. It was, however, confined to gloves and strait waistcoats and reserved for cases of extreme violence. "Coercion chairs," "ma- nacles," and such instruments of torture transferred with the asylum were consign- ed to the lumber room, and as the estab- lishment was completed and the overseers and keepers became accustomed to manage the lunatics, coercion was gradually abo- lished as far as possible. The need of the comparatively large number of European overseers is insisted on because of the irritating effect on European patients of attempting to control them by native agency. Attempts were made to employ the patients, but without much success. Dr. Cantor remarks "the climate during the greater portion of the year ren- ders farming, gardening, occupation in the kitchen, laundry, or bake-house impracticable, if not absolutely injurious to Europeans. Mechanical skill is exceptional among gentlemen, and intellectual occupation is contraindicted by the state of morbid excitement of the brain. To European soldiers and sailors menial work is distasteful; with regard to country-born patients, Dr. J. Mac- pherson has observed the habitual disdain in which, when well, they hold all mechanical employment, except the congenial one of copying and writing." The female patients were employed to some extent with needle work, but it was found " no easy task to humour East Indian females, who generally consider sewing to be the business of a tailor, and therefore derogatory to the dignity of a lady."

The result of taking over the asylum by Government led, however, to a considerable saving. The cost under the old system had gradually risen from Rs. 37,000 in 1846 to Rs. 55,000 in 1855, but the number of patients treated is not given except for 1854-55. The table in the margin shows the general financial results of the two years pre- ceding and the two years immediately following the transfer to Government. With an increase of patients treated( 20 ) and that the diet " appears most nearly to assimilate with the habitual mode of living of some of these persons, while it may be assumed to be more liberal than that to which sailors and landsmen of small means are accus- tomed." Tobacco was allowed to male Europeans and to East Indians of both sexes. Such is a brief outline of the condition of the asylum as reorganized on its transfer to Government. The Surgeon-General, in forwarding the reports from which it has been taken, brings to notice the judgment and economy exercised by Dr. Cantor in the difficult task of bringing the asylum into thorough working order. The description applies almost exactly at the present time, for although numerous improvements have been effected, the asylum is still in essentials, both of construction and management much as it was in 1857. Whatever changes have been made, seem to have been suggested primarily in the interests of the patients; although those of Government have been duly considered. Appendix A is a memorandum by Dr. Payne submitted to Government in December 1877 on the financial working of the asylum since he assumed charge of it in 1860. The annual reports are chiefly occupied with professional details, and give little information as to expenditure. It seems unnecessary for the Committee to discuss Dr. Payne's memorandum in detail. The figures have been checked and found correct. It may, however, be interesting to make a brief com- parison between the asylum as it is at present and as it was in 1856-57. The grounds have been much improved; a fine day room of iron work covered with creepers and resembling a conservatory more than a room has been provided for the female patients. One of the walks has been covered in with trellis work, affording a shady lounge; an orchid house has been added; new latrines have been provided, and the dry-earth system of con- servancy has been introduced; shower-baths have been substituted for the old bathing tubs, and arrangements made as at Dullanda for the immediate escape of the foul water. The " pleasing feature of rural quiet" ascribed to the asylum by Dr. Cantor is still there, and the grounds are still more like " a gentleman's carefully tended pleasure ground" than they were in 1856. The cages( 21 ) believed to be explainable by variations in the proportion of first class and second class patients. Meat ... ... ... ... ... 1 lb. Bread ... ... ... ... ... 1 ( 22 ) remaining unused from the first and second class tables is very properly utilized in feeding the others. This would bring up the true value of a fourth class diet to about 4 annas 6 pies a day. All the patients said they had plenty to eat, and many of them frequently leave a considerable portion of their food. The Committee are satisfied after careful enquiry and examination that the food leaves nothing to be desired either in quality or quantity, and the numbers being small, much greater variety in cooking is possible than in the large hospitals. The Committee think that in the past the cost of diet has been greater than was at all necessary, but this was a direct consequence of the system by which many of the patients were far better fed than they had ever been at home. Dr. Payne's memorandum shows that, while the interests of the unfortunate lunatics have always been the first care, those of the State have been sufficiently considered and that the net cost of the asylum has fallen from an average of Rs. 57,000 from 1857 to 1862 (it was Rs. 71,000 in 1859) to about Rs. 1,500 in 1878, exclusive of the Superintendent's pay. The average popu- lation is only about half what it was, but this should have involved a relative increase in cost as the fixed establishment remains practically the same. That the cost is Rs. 1,500 instead of Rs. 35,500 shows that the interests of the public have been well looked after, and the Committee have no recommendation to make exceptAPPENDIX A. Extracts from a Memorandum (No. 328, dated 17th December 1877), by Dr. Payne, on the Bhowanipore Lunatic Asylum. * * * * * * * * 2. The only practical effect aimed at in this story is to influence future judgment on the working of the asylum, by showing, firstly, the fallaciousness of averages in reckoning the cost of a small asylum for all classes; and, secondly, by setting forth the grounds of a belief that, so long as an asylum for Europeans and Eurasians of all classes shall be main- tained here, a certain absolute sum must be expended annually, and chiefly for establishment, which sum shall not vary much with numbers of inmates, but without which neither safety nor decency can be secured. If, in addition, I shall convey an idea that this minimum expenditure has been reached, I shall consider myself fortunate. If not, the principle accepted will at least prevent future measurement of economy by averages. 3. The financial results of the several measures of reform are summarized in the annexed table, where they may be seen at a glance, if the Lieutenant-Governor should not have leisure for particulars. 4. The establishment as fixed for some years passed is sufficient numerically for the ordinary asylum population. It will suffice even if the inmates increase, provided that paying-patients increase in fair proportion; and it will be no more than sufficient if numbers fall. It comprises a public staff of European officers and of native warders so small that a single severe case strains to the utmost the power of the whole group, and a body of menial servants, every man of whom is daily hard worked in securing decency and cleanliness. 5. A fixed charge for establishment which cannot fluctuate with fluctuating numbers, and which forms the largest item of cost, condemns of itself all attempts to measure economy by averages. If the number of patients be halved, the Government will spend less money in total, but the average cost will be nearly doubled; and if the number be doubled, an average nearly halved will attend an increased total cost. 6. Further, in casting the averages as now presented under orders, the totals employed include money spent on paying-patients, whose diet cannot be restricted to necessaries, and is much more costly than that of the paupers. The same is true in the case of clothing and a few sundries, so that in the columns of the annexed table, which purport to set forth the average cost of each patient under separate headings, the figure is in no instance a true one as applied to either class. It may be said that, so far as Government outlay is concerned, the error is neutralized in the column of general net cost, where the pauper receives the benefit of the payment of other classes to which he does not contribute. This is true enough; but the figure remains only a mean number, obtained by distributing the yearly totals of cost over an average daily number of inmates to which it stands in no true relation as I have shown; and it affords, therefore, no data for comparison of places or periods, nor any criterion of progress, which are the first and chief uses of an average. It is at the same time at variance with the actual outlay of Government money. * * * * * * * * 8. I believe that nothing has been omitted from the following statements which is important to the issue, whether tending to economy or the reverse. The points to which attention has been given and the chronological order of the several measures of reform are these:ii was very small, and the number of troop-ships was also small, we were threatened with a partial return to the old costly practice. No time was lost in representing this, and, pending final orders, the rule of numbers was suspended for the current season. 11. Having ascertained that in other colonies and dependencies of England all insane soldiers were sent home with invalids without regard to their condition, I now suggested that all such men should be sent direct to Bombay with the invalids and time- expired men of regiments, instead of following the old circuitous route with its fatigues and expenses. This proposal involved many considerations and some tedious references, but was adopted in its entirety. Lunatic soldiers from the Presidency Division of the army and exceptional cases from Upper India alone remained for transmission to Calcutta; and these, under a later arrrangement, have been sent for shipment to Bombay in due season. The change did not take full effect till 1873, from which year till the end of 1876 there were received into the asylum only 28 soldiers, of whom 19 were sent to Bombay without cost to the Government, and one only, a convict in peculiar circumstances, was despatched with civil lunatics at the cost of the Military Department. It is understood that the cost of transport by troop-ship is about £25 per man. 12. The effect of these several measures on the admission of soldiers to this asylum is seen in the following figures :iii original suggestion had been adopted after 1863, the cost of despatching 20 other seamen would have been similarly saved. 17. The local Government being thus acquitted of the removal of insane soldiers and sailors, the number of passages annually required had become very small; being, indeed, that only of the unrecovered pauper lunatics of the season. Ship charges on individuals are higher with small than with large numbers, and it would seem that this has been felt at Bombay as well as here, for in 1874 the Bombay Government proposed that we should send our lunatics there in the shipping season, for embarkation with those on the spot, and so get them carried at lower rates. The proposal was accepted, being in substance the same pro cedure that had proved to be full of advantage in the case of soldiers. A despatch of five men was made in 1876. 18. I have since come to think that the Government of Bombay will derive much greater benefit from this plan than that of Bengal. Freights are lower no doubt, but Bengal has to pay for railway transport across India, and has, moreover, been lately called on, as already intimated, to pay Bombay Rs. 45 per mensem for each person maintained in asylum there, pending his embarkation, although they are all paupers, for whom no payment could be obtained here, even if they should be kept for months in the asylum. 19. The economical results to the local Government of the foregoing attempts at reform may be seen in part from the following abstract statement of the cost of despatching lunatics to Europe in quinquennial periods from 1856 to date. Particulars are given in the appended table:iv largely controllable. In 1860 the establishment was bad at all points. It was numerous and ill paid. There were five Europeans and 74 natives, and not one of the whole number was fit to approach a lunatic. Reduction of inmates admitted of reduction of attendants, and further reductions were made with the object of improving the pay and efficiency of the remainder. This process ended when the European subordinates had come down to two overseers and a matron, and the natives to 43 in number. At one time retrenchment under pressure was carried too far, and we had to retrace our steps. After this all wages rose rapidly in Calcutta, and our subordinates and servants left us for better pay elsewhere. Increase was inevitable now; numbers could not be diminished, for there was now but one European warder for the constant service of all the male wards, and one for the women, who also had matron's charge of the whole asylum. One native attendant entertained for three European lunatics, allowed only one for every six in constant attendance, a force made ade- quate only by freely using the servants of paying-patients. 27. This is the condition of the establishment at the present time. The resident officer or Deputy Superintendent, though his position has been somewhat improved, is, after long and good service, paid less than the head subordinates of either jail, and less than his juniors in the police, or the marine service which he quitted to come here. The matron has four mehtranees for the whole duties of the female ward for watch and menial work together, a merely nominal staff which can only be kept together by the aid of private servants. The native male warder is paid only Rs. 9 per mensem and gets many a rough knock in the course of his day's work. It often happens that a patient is removed by his friends, who carry away our best men to their home, with Rs. 12 or Rs. 15 a month as wages. 28. Therefore, though the cost of establishment is nearly as high as ever it was, the warder staff is numerically a mere nucleus, enabled by adventitious aid to carry on the work of watch and ward. It is, however, a nucleus of good men quick to make new-comers useful by their own example of activity and forbearance; and in this we have greatly gained on former years. 29. The figures in the establishment columns do not include the pay of the Superin- tendent, which is a large item not under asylum control. Formerly, a staff salary of Rs. 1,000 per mensem in addition to pay of rank was attached to the appointment. This allowance was reduced to Rs. 500 in 1865, and subsequently abolished under the new warrant for departmental pay. The Superintendent now receives the pay of his rank only, with house rent; but the charge distributed in average makes a heavy addition to the single lunatic's cost, although half is debited to the native asylum. 30. The next column shows the cost of sundries, items which vary little from year to year or with number or quality of inmates. Lighting charges, assessed rates, and petty miscellaneous items make up the amount. 31. In clothing it was necessary in the earlier years to increase rather than diminish expenditure. It had been customary for lunatics to pass the day with very scanty covering, and maniacs were commonly suffered to go naked. This system worked to economy of clothing, but there were technical reasons against it, the influence of which raised the clothing bills even though numbers fell. The uniformly high figures of the later years is due in some degree to the practice of giving half-worn clothes, as part of sea outfit, to lunatics embarking for Europe, and replacing them by new ones. The charge for sea outfits falls therefore, and that for asylum clothing rises. It must be observed, at the same time, that the sums entered in this column include money paid for clothing of paying-patients and recovered from their friends. The later amounts, therefore, are even larger and more uniform than the first consideration would make them. 32. When there no longer appeared to be avoidable outlay in the asylum, and the conveyance of all lunatics to Europe had been cheapened to the utmost, it still seemed that the State was more heavily taxed than it ought to be by reason of the very small charges made for the maintenance of persons who could afford to pay. The next step, therefore, was directed to the reduction of net cost by recovering a fair proportion from those who benefited by the institution. Something was done in respect of existing inmates by searching out the means of relatives; and something more by stringent orders of Government to Magis- trates. Finally, in 1876, an opportunity was taken of setting forth the insignificant amounts charged by Government for asylum care, even to the highest classes, and the want of a rate of payment intermediate between that and the lowest class. An experiment was ordered, and, as it proved perfectly successful, the change was made permanent at the end of the year. The amounts received in successive years are stated in the 15th column of the table, which shows improvement for the last six years and a very great advance in 1876. I may mention that the receipts of 1877 will exceed Rs. 16,000, and the net cost of the asylum, excluding Superintendent's pay, will be about Rs. 9,352. 33. In the earlier years, when the asylum population was larger and the laboring classes well represented, an attempt was made to introduce profitable industry into the asylum under the encouragement of great success in the native institution. The population was, however, too unstable for useful results, and its quality also soon changed in a manner unfavourable to industry. It could nearly be pushed as an idea, not to the practical advantage of any one concerned, and was accordingly abandoned. Needle- work has been always carried on in the female ward. 34. The table ends with a statement of the net annual charges of the asylum, includ- ing cost of despatching lunatics to Europe, and excluding only the Superintendent's pay and house rent.
v 35. The period embraced is a long one, and the downward course of figures from 65,000 in 1860 to 9,352 in 1877 shows many fluctuations; but the table bears in one or other of its columns the reason and explanation of every important difference. I do not wish it to be supposed that this money saving is anything more than the natural result of correcting errors. That it is so large is due to the magnitude of the errors, and these were so obvious that to leave them alone would have been censurable. If rigorous economy had been pur- sued in these years as a sole object, the results might be regarded as not altogether unsucess- ful; but so little has this been the case that, until the present time, I have never even collected facts to show general financial results. Proposals have been strengthened by the know- ledge that the public purse would benefit, but I am especially anxious to guard against the supposition that economy has in any instance been effected at the expense of the lunatics. The largest reforms, though first suggested by money considerations, were seen, before they were brought forward, to subserve also the well-being of the people. The imbecile soldier would carry his foibles more comfortably in a troop-ship than as the associate of maniacs under special provision. The mad pauper sent to England would be more cheaply housed and fed there than here, but many a one would (and did) recover; some would find friends, and all would be better there. In denying heavy food and stimulants to men without work or regular exercise, I have had regard to their health, and the avoidance of waste, but dietary charges have of course come down in consequence. I certainly did not see why insane seamen should be carried home at the cost of this Government when all other seamen, sick and distressed, were removed by the Board of Trade. Nor did I see why persons in affluence should be altogether maintained by the State for a monthly sum which in private life would not buy the services of a single sick nurse ; but these were the only reforms proposed in which money was the sole consideration. 36. On the other hand, when I have thought more outlay was wanted, I have not scrupled to make it or ask for it, and have met with unvarying support in doing so, except on one or two occasions when applications in favour of subordinates have been rejected. 37. Economy thus effected claims no favourable notice at the hands of authority; but the result is that, after now scrutinizing every item of charge with sole reference to finance, I cannot see the way to any further reduction of importance, except such as may arise from sedulously guarding against the abuse of Government charity by individuals. * * * * 38. In connection with reimbursement, I may conclude this paper by menitoning two suggestions which I have lately had it in mind to submit relating to the pauper patients:MEDICAL & MUNICIPAL DEPT.

Its keepers are trained men of an exceptionally good type, and it is absolutely necessary to pay them fairly to retain their services. So well have they done their work that there has not been a single case of violence during the last two years. At Dacca there have been constant complaints of the inefficiency of the keepers and the insufficiency of the pay given. Cases of violence are not uncommon, and the same may be said of Hazareebagh. These considerations go far to account for the high average at Dullunda. Deducting the excess in the Superintendent and Deputy Superintendent's pay over the similar items elsewhere, reduces the cost, Rs. 30 per patient, and the difference in wages reduces it Rs. 11 more. There are several servants rendered necessary by con- ditions not apparently obtaining in other asylums( 3 ) people vary greatly in each district. The Committee support the views of the Superintendents, and the Lieutenant-Governor will not press for the adoption of any uniform scale. 7.

Dr. Payne says: ''An indolent, unhealthy sore is very rarely seen here." In 1871 Dr. Payne having gone to England on furlough, a series of observations were made by Dr. Bird with a view to deciding the question of the existence of scurvy. Careful notes were taken of the condition of the gums of all patients and new admissions, and it was found that the supposed scorbutic condition of the gums described by Dr. Saunders was not due to scurvy, but to the habitual neglect of their teeth by lunatics. The Surgeon-General, in his remarks on the report, says: " The observations on the condition of the gums in lunatics, which gave rise to the impression that they were suffering from scurvy, are important ;* * * * * * it is very doubtful whether the peculiar appearances noticed betoken scurvy at all, and quite certain that scurvy does not develop within the institution." This seems to show that the improved and more expensive diet was ordered under a mis- apprehension as to its necessity.* The reduced mortality which attended its introduction was followed by a considerable rise in 1874 and 1875 ; the increase, like the decrease, not being attributable to it. In 1875 the ration of ghee was stopped, yet in 1876 the death-rate was lower than in any previous year save one ; while in 1877 and 1878 it has been lower than ever, and is now lower than in most English asylums, in spite of the fact that there is a larger proportion of cases likely to die in the Indian asylums. Since the beginning of this year the meat ration has also been abolished, two ounces of pulse being given in lieu of it, and the present diet-scale is less than that pronounced " thoroughly inadequate " by Dr. Saunders ; yet the patients are surprisingly healthy. The statement in the margin shows the death-rate, the quantity of food supplied in ounces, and the cost of food per patient per diem since 1856. One main cause of the increase in the cost has been a general rise in the price of provisions; but the general high level between 1869 and 1878 was due to the issue of meat and ghee. The marked reduction in 1879 has been brought about by the stopping of the meat ration and the substitution of a cheaper but more nutri- tious quality of rice. The provisions of all sorts are still fully equal to " the best kind in use by the corresponding classes of persons in the neighbourhood." Every patient has as much as he wants. Extras are freely ordered for the sick, but the great majority of the patients get the ordinary full diet, which is very similar to what they are accustomed to at home. Dr. Payne is convinced that it is in every way sufficient, and the general appearance of the patients seems to prove it to be so. The Committee can testify from personal knowledge that the lunatics at Dullunda are amply fed with excellent well-cooked food. The Lieutenant-Governor entirely accepts the conclusions of the Committee on this point. 8. The expenditure on bazar medicines is small, and the differences unimportant, depending probably on the more or less free use of indigenous drugs by different Superintendents. No statement of the value of English medicines has been furnished to the Committee by the Examiner of Medical Accounts. To these items of expenditure the Surgeon-General will no doubt now give careful attention. 9. The figures of contingent charges show great variations, and prove on examination not to be comparable inter se. They are( 5 ) explained in Dullunda by the use of gas for oil, and in other asylums by varieties of practice in the mode of accounting for oil made in the asylums. Again, in Dullunda many subsidiary buildings made out of manufacture profits are repaired from the contingent allowance, while in other asylums all build- ings are on the Public Works' books. Moreover, many costly improvements have been introduced at the Presidency that are not asked for elsewhere. The apparently heavy charge at Patna, as compared with other institutions in the interior, is accounted for by charges for ground rent. 10. The figures for the item of clothing compare thus( 6 ) the others. This is no doubt in part due to the better market which the metropolis affords for the ready and quick sale of manufactured articles. With a working population only twelve in excess of that of Dacca, its cash receipts for articles sold were in 1878 Rs. 18,926 against Rs. 6,315, while it made over for asylum use goods valued at Rs. 6,882 against Rs. 36. In addition to this, it added during the year Rs. 618 to the value of its store of raw material, Rs. 688 to its stock of manufactured articles, and Rs. 3,437 to its plant and machinery; while Dacca shows a falling off under each of these heads, amounting in the aggregate to Rs. 340. The net result is that the profits at Dullunda are raised from Rs. 1,513 to Rs. 6,258 ; while those at Dacca fall from Rs. 3,923 to Rs. 3,582. The net earnings per employed patient are thus Rs. 34 at Dullunda and Rs. 20 at Dacca( 7 ) VI.( 8 ) seldom arises in the asylum. The dietaries and the death-rates have had no appa- rent connection. At present the average consumption of food is about 36 ounces per patient daily. It is of excellent quality. The great saving in 1878 has been due to a dimi- nution in the number of first class patients, and of pure Europeans who eat more than Eurasians. The average cost of diets has varied from 7 annas 6 pies in 1863 to 13 annas 6 pies in 1877 ; but, as already pointed out by Dr. Payne, this is a mere arithmetical mean, and does not correctly represent the expenditure on either class of patients. The first class patients have cost much more, and the pauper patients much less than the average. The variations have depended on the proportions of different classes of patients and of Europeans and Eurasians. Since 1876 there have been four classes of patients, the first three paying Rs. 150, Rs. 80, and Rs. 45 respectively, the fourth paying nothing. Up to 1877 no attempt was made to distribute the cost of dieting the different classes, but this is now done as far as practicable. It is found that first class patients cost about Rs. 32 per mensem, second class Rs. 17, third class from Rs. 10 to Rs. 12, and fourth class from Rs. 8 to Rs. 10; the amount varying with the season of the year. The daily expenditure on fourth class patients varies from about 3 annas 2 pies to 5 annas 2 pies according to season, the average being about 4 annas 1 pie. This, however, does not represent with absolute exactness the true value, since waste is not permitted, and any food remaining unused from the first and second class tables is very properly utilized in feeding the others. This would bring up the true value of a fourth class diet to about 4 annas 6 pies a day. All the patients said they had plenty to eat, and many of them frequently leave a considerable portion of their food. The Committee are satisfied after careful enquiry and examination that the food leaves nothing to be desired either in quality or quantity, and the numbers being small, much greater variety in cooking is possible than in the large hospitals. The Committee think that in the past the cost of diet has been greater than was at all necessary, but this was a direct consequence of the system by which many of the patients were far better fed than they had ever been at home. 16. With regard to the Committee's recommendation that the pay of the Deputy Superintendent of the European Asylum at Bhowanipore should begin at Rs. 250, and rise by annual increments of Rs. 10 per mensem to a maximum of Rs. 400, the Lieutenant-Governor, while acknowledging the good work done by Mr. DeVere, the Deputy Superintendent, regrets his inability, under existing financial cir- cumstances, to recommend any increase to his present pay. The recommenda- tion of the Committee will, however, be kept in view. * J. O'Kinealy, Esq. ... ... Pretident. Surgeon-Major J. M. Coates ... ... ( 9 ) No. 70.
