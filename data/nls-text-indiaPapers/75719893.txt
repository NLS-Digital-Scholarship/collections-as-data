ANNUAL REPORT OP THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT BENGAL FROM THE YEAR 1895-96. No. 231V.D., dated Belgatohia, the 28th April 1896. From(2) irrigation is economically worked by means of a hand pump, and requires extremely little labour. More shrubs have been planted for ornamentation, and all these improvements have been effected without extra cost to Government. 7. The crush erected last year has proved of great service to the students and attendants in restraining vicious and dangerous horses. With very little trouble a bad-tempered horse can be secured, and its feet or any injuries that it may be affected with, safely attended. Hospital. 8. Hospital practice has been, as in previous years, varied ana instructive to the students; and considering the difficulties under which they work, they have been very attentive. During the year they have had opportunities of thoroughly observing several oases of the most virulent contagious diseases, viz., glanders, rinderpest, and foot and mouth disease, and they should not have any difficulty in diagnosing cases of this description. 9. As the students pass out of the Institution, one of their most important duties will be to thoroughly diagnose oases of contagious disease and prevent its spread, and this advice has been well impressed upon them. They have also had the advantage of seeing several obstetrio cases. 10. All animals are examined as to being affected with contagious disease previous to being admitted into the hospital. This has been considered necessary for the safety of other patients. Suspected animals are led straight to the isolated wards, where they are kept segregated until a correct diagnosis can be made. 11. The varied description of the diseases of all domestic animals may be seen in the appendices (A 1 to D), from which it will be understood that the students have had ample opportunities of learning the practical portion of their profession. The main difficulty felt by the students is the fact that the Institution is a long way out of Calcutta. This difficulty is now about to be removed. Government has generously considered the grievances of the students, and His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor has sanctioned the erection of a hostel at a cost of Rs. 25,000 for the sole accommodation of the students of the Bengal Veterinary Institution. 12. At a meeting of the Committee of Management hold on the 13th November 1895, it was represented that it was a great hardship for the students who live at a distance from Belgatchia, and the large majority do, to give proper attention to the practical part of their course, viz, dressing and attending on patients. Belgatohia certainly has special needs for a hostel, as it is in an out-of-the-way situation, and the arguments that usually apply to the establishment of a hostel apply with additional force to the Bengal Veterinary Institution. It was within the knowledge of one of the members that several candidates for the Institution were deterred from joining owing to the distance from Calcutta. Even the nearest tramway terminus was a mile from the school. It was further argued that if a hostel was built it was probable that more students from the mufassil would present themselves, and no doubt such would be the case. It is also possible that young men from the mufassil will have a primary knowledge of the handling of animals, and this will undoubtedly be of great service to them in their veterinary studies. Operations. 13. There were 181 operations performed as against 169 in the previous year, and comprised 32 different classes of operations. Among them were five amputations of the limbs, all of which were successful. One amputation case was an old animal, that died from exhaustion on the 23rd day after the operation. All the second-yoar students were put through a course of operations on the dead subject, and afterwards each performed at least two operations on the living animal under supervision. It is gratifying to be able to report that the students showed nerve and skill in the performance of the several operations entrusted to them. 14. The list of operations, as tabulated in the appendix (E), will show that they have all been of an instructive and varied nature. Each operator was appointed to entirely look after his case until its termination. All operations are conducted on the most humane principles, and every animal previous to being operated upon is put thoroughly under the influence of ohloroform or some other effective anæsthetic. Admission of students. 15 Of the 20 students who were promoted from class A to class B, 19 have continued to attend regularly throughout the year. Hari Churn Chatterjee, who did not rejoin the Institution, passed last on the list at the examination held in March 1895. He had also passed last on the list at the examination hold in November 1894. 16. Twenty new students joined the Institution on the 23rd June 1895, and all have regularly attended the course of lectures. Four of the students who failed to pass the 'promotion examination did not return to the school, so that the number in each class during the year was 19 and 24 respectively, making a total of 43. 17. It is anticipated that when the hostel, is |built the number of students will increase. 18. Considering the long distance that the majority of the students have to come daily, I am glad to be able to report that the general attendance was good, and the oases entrusted to their care were well looked after. Stipends. 19. The 15 Government stipends for class B. were given to the 15 students who stood highest in the list at the annual examination held in March 1895 and who held no other scholarship. These were tonable for one year.
(3) 20. The same difficulty as occurred last year was experienced in the distribution of stipends among class A, and it was decided to hold an examination in November (see Appendix H). 21. It was considered that the conditions under which these stipends were held were not clearly understood and set forth. It was therefore proposed that the subject should be discussed at a meeting of the Committee of Management. Comprehensive rules for the bestowal and holding of the 30 Government stipends have now been framed and sub- mitted to Government for approval. 22. In consequence of Surendro Nath Bose having passed his final examination, the Sheo Bux Bogla Scholarship of Rs. 10 per mensem became vacant on the 31st March last. It will therefore be necessary to re-award the scholarship at the beginning of next session. 23. Of the 11 scholarships promised from various District Boards, only seven holders attended the Institution :(4) 32. The examinations for class A were conducted by myself. Only one paper was given, viz., in physiology, a copy of which is appended (G). In other subjects the tests were conducted vivd voce. A list of the marks obtained is also appended (H). This result may be considered satisfactory, as only 6 students failed to pass out of 23 who were examined. It is to be regretted that it was considered necessary to degrade one student on account of copying. 33. On the whole the progress of the school may be considered to have been good, and it may be anticipated that in the succeeding years the Bengal Veterinary Institution will grow in popularity with young men of good education and who are fond of animals. I do not, however, consider that a two years' course of instruction is sufficient to enable young men to become good Veterinary Assistants, and in my opinion the Government, local bodies, and other employers would be greater gainers if the Veterinary Assistants' course was extend- ed to at least three years. Moreover, the students themselves would be considerable gainers, as their attainments would be more respected by their employers, and their services more readily sought. The third year would be entirely devoted to practical work, and with the con- venience of having living accommodation on the premises, there should be no reason why the students should not pass out of the Institution thoroughly useful and practical professional men. CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT. Cattle-disease. 34. During the year under review cattle-diseases may be said to have been practi- cally non-prevalent, except with regard to foot-and-mouth disease. The reason of this is probably due to the fact that both fodder and water have been comparatively plentiful throughout the year, and probably to the fact that in Bengal there has been an exceptionally light rainfall. 35. In the Appondix "I" a tabulated form has been made, showing from which districts cattle-disease (to use a gonerio term) has been reported; and in order to at once convey a general idea of its virulence, it has been considered advisable to use the terms "few" "very few" and "several" to denote approximately the number of cattle attacked. 36. If the very large number of cattle in the 47 districts of Bengal is taken into consideration, it may be deemed a matter for congratulation that there has been so little cattle-disease of an epidemic nature, and even that was of the benign form, such as foot and-mouth disease assumes. Purnea, Bhagalpur, and Dinajpur would seem to have most suffered, while in Cuttack large numbers of cattle were incapacitated for work during the months of January and February 1896. Anthrax. 37. Anthracoid diseases are exceptionally malignant in Europe, but seem, according to the reports received, to be extremely rare in Bengal. Only one mild outbreak in point of numbers appears to have occurred in Bengal, in the Midnapore Collectorate, although the percentage of mortality was high. In the village of Tanka 21 out of 23 animals succumbed, and in the village of Bagu, Kedgree police station, 8 animals were attacked, of which 5 died. The first attack was on the 9th July, and continued until the i9th July 1895. The report states that only cows are attacked by the disease, and the principal symptoms were a, profuse discharge of thick saliva from the mouth and swelling of the throat. The animal then is prevented from eating, and dies in a day or two. The disease is known by the name of Gola Kontaki, and has never previously been seen in this neighbourhood, and is said to be due to the unusual drinking of water on account of the heat and exposure to rain. The usual treatment adopted is to brand the swelling on the throat with a hot iron, and internally stimulants are admiris- tered, such as ginger, pipul (long pepper), dry tobacco leaf, deeoction of mango bark, jam tree (blackberry), bakul, and goava tree. No food of any sort is given during the sickness. Other unaffected cattle from the herd were removed and kept away from the diseased animals. Rinderpest. 38. Rinderpest is by far the most formidable of the contagious cattle diseases in Bengal, although it does not claim the most numerous viotims. During the year the most serious outbreak was reported from Hazaribagh in the Bogadar, Gomiar, and Dumri subdivisions. The epidemic lasted during October l895.
(5) 39. In the Bogadar subdivision 139 animals were attacked, out of which 72 died. In Gomiar subdivision 208 out of 317 succumbed, while in Dumri in the Giridih sub- division the large number of 612 animals died out of 964 seizures. The disease goes by the name of Barka Dookh. On enquiries being made, the Deputy Commissioner of Hazaribagh reported that the natives treated the animals after methods of their own, and as the disease was disappearing, no assistance was required. The disease was not spreading, and affected the cattle annually. Measures were taken to prevent the disease from spreading, and people were instructed to keep the diseased animals separate from the rest. The carcases were buried so as not to allow Chamars to remove the hides for Bale. 40. From August to December 1895 rinderpest may be said to have been persistent in Purnea. The villages near the police-outposts Tamajganj and Belgatchia were particularly unfortunate. Excepting Tamajganj, where 20 animals succumbed out of 44 attacked, the number of seizures were few, averaging about 5 in each village. During the month of November the disease was much more widely spread, and attacked cattle more or less severely in the villages of Parora, Kashar, Katraili, Luckna, Hansi, and Maghgaon. 41. On the 24th December 1895, a report was received from the Superintendent, General Hospital, Howrah, to the effect that rinderpest had broken out among the hospital cattle, and that within three days 13 cows out of a total of 20 had died. I went to the hospital and examined the remaining cows, two of which were suffering from a mild form of the disease. The precaution of disinfecting the stalls had been thoroughly carried out, and I recommended that the animals should remain whore they were, as there was less chance of spreading the disease than if they were allowed outside, particularly as their standings had been thoroughly purified. No further deaths were reported. 42. When the disease sets in with acute diarrhæa the people call it morak or cholera, in all probability on acoount of its fatal termination. As little is understood about these diseases by the natives, there can be very little reliance placed on the reports of death. When, however, each district employs an educated Veterinary Assistant, the reports will be much more satisfactory, and the information thus gleaned will prove valuable in thoroughly studying these epidemics and controlling them. 43. It will, however, be seen that these epidemics can scarcely be called severe; and considering the enormous numbers of cattle in the districts, serious epidemics may be said to have been non-existent during the years 1895-96. On the receipt of information a Veterinary Assistant was always immediately despatched with instructions and the necessary medicines to the locality from which the disease was reported, and it may justly be considered that these energetic measures had much to do with localizing the epidemic and preventing its spreading. Foot-and-mouth disease. 44. At the commencement of the year a report was received from the Collector of Cuttack, from which it appeared that 3,425 cattle had been attacked with foot-and-mouth disease, and that out of this number 112 animals had died. The epidemic would seem to have spread over Cuttack, Salepur, Jagutsingpur, Tirtoli, Kendrapara, and Daramsala police-outposts. The disease being of a benign nature, simple treatment and cleanliness is all that is required. Mr. Growse remarks " that the disease is not so serious as was at first supposed. The figures have been compiled by the police, but they do not seem reliable. The disease appears almost every year, and dies out under native treatment, or more often without any treatment. Deaths have been few in comparison with the numbers attacked ; so I did not think a Veterinary Assistant necessary." In the case of disease of the feet, the natives make the cattle stand in mud. Turpentine, coal-tar, and kerosine oil are also applied to the affected parts. Where the mouth is also affected, the sores are washed with a warm lotion made of an infusion of leaves, such as Durlabha, Begunia (Brinjal) or Hinjal 45. In September 1895 the Collector of Rangpur forwarded to me four reports showing that foot-and-mouth disease had broken out among the cattle of the Nilphamari subdivision. A Veterinary Assistant was at once despatched to the district with the necessary medicines, but the epidemic proved to be exceedingly mild, and by treatment and isolation the disease was suppressed. In the Dinajpur district, particularly in the Thakurgaon subdivision, a large number of cattle suffered from foot-and-mouth disease, and 33 animals died out of 417 attacked ; but as the epidemic oocurred out of the ploughing season, very little incon- venience was felt, and the number of deaths was very small. Cattle of the district of Patna, principally in the Mokameh subdivision, also suffered considerably from this complaint, but only 13 deaths were reported to have occurred. Instructions as to the proper treatment were sent to the Magistrate, who had them widely circulated among cattle-owners in the district, and this action seems to have arrested the progress of the disease. In the district round the Islampur thana the disease seems to have affected 1,118 animals, but only 5 deaths resulted ; and with the precautions already advised and circulated, the disease soon abated. The affection is called korha, and has been seen in previous years, and is well known to the people. 46. Pleuro-pneumouia as a contagious disease is unknown in Bengal, and may be said to be non-existent. 47. In Appendix J a tabulated form has been made showing the percentages of deaths from the various contagious diseases which have been reported. These figures may only
(6) be taken as an indication of the mortality of the different diseases, but can certainly not be relied upon. Comparative statistics will only become useful when all the obtainable information is collected by trained Veterinary Assistants, and it is hoped that at no distant future one or two of the graduates of the Bengal Veterinary Institution will be appointed to every district(7) of Cruelty to Animals if they insisted upon suffering animals being kept in the hospitals attached to these dispensaries until they were in a fit and workable condition. 57. What a boon it would be to the poor suffering creatures in and around Calcutta if the laws were amended so that the Calcutta branch of that admirable Society might be enabled to send sick and lame animals to the Bengal Veterinary Institution for care and treatment, until the poor beasts recovered, instead of inflicting a fine on the owners, which, generally speaking, is really a further cruelty to the animals, who are made to suffer in conse- quence, by either being worked at night or having their food curtailed, or perhaps both. 58. It is believed that Mr. Lees, Secretary of the Society, has expressed a wish to send the animals for treatment, and in a letter to the Chief Presidency Magistrate, Calcutta, dated 5th September 1894, he specially drew attention to the existence of the Bengal Veterinary Institution and the facilities it afforded for receiving and treating sick and injured animals, and confessed that the Society has felt that punishing a delinquent with a fine for working an unfit animal does not protect the unfortunate animal from being used. The Institution should be appointed an infirmary for the purposes of Act XI of 1890. Glanders. 59. During the year under report no case of glanders was detected among the animals assembled at the Sonepur, Barahpur (Shahabad) or Kalimpong Fairs. Several cases of this disease in Calcutta have been reported and inspected, in accordance with rules laid down in Act VIII of 1880, and the animals have been destroyed, but these powers were not exercised beyond the Calcutta urban and suburban limits. His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor has now extended this Act in a Government Notification, No. 501 Medical, dated 6th February 1896, to the area occupied by the Sonepur mela in the district of Saran during the annual continuance of that fair ; also to the area occupied by the Kalimpong and Barahpur mêlas in the districts of Darjeeling and Shahabad respectively during the annual continuance of those fairs. 60. When the districts are supplied with Veterinary Assistants there will be a proper agency for the detection of this virulent disease, but until then it would be advisable only to invest the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bengal, the Assistant Superin- tendent, Bengal Veterinary Institution, and the Veterinary Assistant with the Superintendent with the powers of an Inspector under the Act, and they would also have the power of certifying to the correctness of the diseases. Supply of bulls and cattle-breeding. 61. The improvement of cattle is a very important subject in a country where every- thing is dependent upon these animals for plough and draught work, and just now the matter is being brought prominently before the public. The supply of a better class of bulls will no doubt do much to improve the physique, but unless the young stock are better fed, and the wretched specimens of Brahmini bulls transferred from the herds to the municipal carts, the good results expected from the importation of valuable bulls will be disappointing. 62. In my report last year it was suggested that some of the bulls in Bihar might with advantage be transferred to Lower Bengal, where the cattle are very small. For this purpose seventeen bulls have been obtained from Bihar and Shahabad, and have been distributed as follows:-(8) account of their small size, and yet these animals would be a great acquisition to the herds of Lower Bengal, where the average animals stand from 40 to 44 inches behind the hump. 66. A gradual extension of this process would certainty tend to improve the animals of the country generally by raising their height and yet retaining their sturdiness. Although small, these animals are capable of drawing very large loads, averaging 25 to 30 maunds, and yet they are not large consumers of food, such as larger animals would be. 67. I would therefore accentuate my suggestion that all small Brahmini bulls between the height of 50 and 54 inches, which are to be found roaming about in the North-West Provinces and which are not required there, might be transferred to Bihar, and that smaller bulls might be transported to Lower Bengal. This would be an economical way of im- proving the breeds of cattle: there would also be an infusion of fresh blood, and the size of the cattle would in time be gradually increased. 68. With regard to the Patna cattle, it seems a pity to allow the breed to deteriorate for want of fresh blood of the original stook. I would therefore strongly urge that this, which has almost become a special breed, be revivified by the importation of a few Queensland bulls, which might be stationed at some of the principal head-quarters near Bankipore, such as Arrah, Gaya, Chapra, and Muzaffarpur. Young bulls from good stock in the jails might be reared and sent to some experimental farm, and when they reach maturity, they might he sent or let loose just as are Brahmini bulls at present. They should have a large recognisable brand, and be considered as Government property lent to the people. 69. The District Boards of Khulna and Sitamarhi have taken a keen interest in the effort to improve their breeds of cattle. Two Sitamarhi bulls have already been given to Khulna by this Department, and the Committee have sent Rs. 250 for the purchase and con- veyance charges of a good bull of the Patna breed. 70. At Sitamarhi, under the direction of Mr. C. L. S. Russell, the Subdivisional Officer, several European and native gentlemen have formed themselves into a society called the "Sitamarhi Cattle Improvement Society," and they have not only given Rs. 250 towards the expenses and prizes at the recently inaugurated cattle show, but they have also ordered from the Government farm, Hissar, two good bulls. A copy of the proceedings in Appendix M-l will be found interesting reading, and will form an excellent example to other District Boards. 71. It is regretted that one of the bulls obtained from Burma and sent to the ward's estate, Serail, died from anthrax last February, as the experimental crossing of the Burman cattle with those of this country would have been interesting. Mule breeding. 72. Nearly two years ago a Persian donkey stallion was sent to Guntok in Sikkim, and placed under the care of Mr. White, the Political Officer. It was thought that as the people saw how anxious Government were to buy good mules, they would take to mule breeding as an occupation. The ponies of this district were known to be of a good sturdy sort, and it was considered that the mares would throw good mules equal for artillery purposes if a good donkey stallion's services were used. Up to the present the experiment has not been altogether satisfactory. During the year 1894-95 only 18 mares were served, and during the year under report 16 mares were covered (Appendix N), and the number of foals dropped has not been reported. It might be worth while to continue the experiment a little longer, as country people are slow to grasp an idea unless they see an immediate and ample profit result. Fairs. 73. There are about 36 large fairs, where various classes of animals are disposed or, and of these four of the most important fairs have been visited, viz., Sonepur, Kalimpong, Barahpur (Shahabad) and Sitamarhi. Sonepore. 74. I visited the Sonepore Fair on the 29th October 1895, and remained until the 7th November 1895. 75. When I arrived I made enquiries as to the number of animals present, and found approximately that there were about 2,0C0 horses and ponies(9) animals or not. The suggestion of the Committee was accepted by Government and acted upon, and a prospectus of cattle prizes was drawn up. The sum of Rs. 250 was divided into prizes as follows:(10) present in very large numbers, and were of good quality. A large number of the latter were bought by dealers for the Calcutta market. 93. The water-supply was excellent, and although there had been no rain for some time, water was ample; chain pumps were used in the wells, and thus the water was free from the dirt which impregnated it in former years. 94. I would reoommend that the sum of Rs. 250 be again granted for the cattle show to be held next year at Sonepur. It is only by such shows and the bestowal of prizes that we may hope to inculcate sound ideas of improvement in cattle-breeding into the people's mind, and encourage a feeling of pride in the possession of fine cattle. 95. Naturally the prices of cattle varied considerably. A good pair of bullooks could not be obtained for less than Rs. 160. The average price of an ordinary cart pair was Rs. 110. Cows varied from Rs. 40 to Rs. 95, according to the quantity of milk they gave. Common plough-bullooks realized from Rs. 15 to Rs. 40. Plough cattle suitable for heavy, deep ploughing were valued at Rs. 100 each. 96. All these cattle are brought from the surrounding districts of Muzaffarpur, Champaran, Arrah, Saran, and Patna. 97. The four breeds represented were the Bihari, Bachour, Sitamarhi, and the Patna or cross breed(11) once we break faith with these people, it will take years tow in back their confidence. This will be a serious loss, because with the increase in the purchase of mules there will be a corre- sponding increase in the importation of wood, which I am informed reached a total of 30,000 maunds lastyear. This then should be another reason why the mêla ought to be encouraged. 109. Five hundred rupees were sanctioned for prizes by the Civil Veterinary Department. The money was distributed among the best animals purchased by the Transport officer, and was divided into 32 prizes. 110. I consider the animals purchased this year are of better quality than those obtained in 1894. This may be due to the larger number brought in for selection. 111. There were 48 ponies brought in for sale, and these were of a very good stamp; but I regret to say that, although prizes were offered for stallions, only two wretched Entire tattoos were shown. No prizes were therefore given to them, as it was considered that it would be inadvisable to reward these animals and thus encourage their use as stallions. 112. There were no donkeys present. 113. The cattle were more largely represented this year, but still there was much room for improvement both in point of numbers and quality. 114. The Nipali breed are very small and compact, with small bones, and are inolined to run to flesh somewhat like the gynce. 115. The Sikkim cattle, called the Siri breed, are comparatively large and handsome beasts, having a long coat, a good hump, and a large powerful form. 116. The usual colour is black, with white markings, which give them a likeness to European cattle. 117. The following measurements were taken of a Siri bullock, a Nipali bull, and a Nipali cow. I have not been able to take satisfactory measurements of a Siri bull:(12) 124. Outside the enclosure and round about the fair it was estimated that there were about 15,000 cattle and 1,000 buffaloes. 125. The horses collected were a thoroughly useless, weedy lot of creatures, and were probably the refuse from the up-country fairs. 126. The ponies were quite as ill-shapen as the horses, and the large majority of them were young and weedy tattoos. 127. They Were all free from glanders. 128. The cattle were of a good, useful stamp, though small in size, and are largely purchased by dealers from Lower Bengal for cart work, and are generally of the class usually seen in the streets of Calcutta. They are capable of much endurance, and for their size draw very heavy loads. 129. On the 11th cattle and ponies were judged for prizes. The number of entries was much larger than at the previous year, which was very encouraging, and this only proves that improvement of the kind can only be brought in gradually. 130. Some of the pairs exhibited were really fine cattle, and the three bulls collected only showed what could be done if big land-owners would retain the better bull-calves and rear them up for the benefit of the surrounding district. Instead of having classes for animals bred in the district and " those bred outside," it may be suggested that to have one set of prizes for all comers would save a considerable amount of confusion, and the exhibitors would be equally pleased. 131. As has already been mentioned, the horses were a very wretched lot, and those exhibited were a poor class. Nevertheless they were a great improvement on those competing in the previous year, and this gives encouragement for the continuance of this agricultural show. 132. The four Entire horses exhibited were leggy, squalling beasts, which ought to have been emasculated, and not allowed to cover mares in the district. 133. The system of enclosures which has been instituted at this fair might be imitated at other fairs with much advantage. Sitamarhi mêla . 134. I visited the Sitamarhi mêla on the 22nd, 23rd, and 24th March for the purpose of inspecting the cattle present, and to judge at the cattle show. 135. Although the Sitamarhi mêla has been renowned for its large collection of cattle for very many years, it was not until this year that an agricultural show has been instituted. The Subdivisional Officer, Mr. Russell, c.s., suggested that as Sitamarhi and the neighbour- hood was renowned for its cattle, an agricultural show would no doubt add to the attractions of the mêla. I was enabled to give him 6ome hints with reference to the most suitable prizes, and the construction of the show ring, and with this slight help Mr. Russell carried through his idea most successfully, especially considering that this was a first attempt, at which officers usually have to overcome stubborn conservative notions. 136. There were only about 4,000 head of cattle on the 22nd March, but by the 24th the number could not have been much less than 150,000. This mêla is a well-known cattle market to which planters and others come to buy good plough and cart bullocks. The better class of cart bullocks used in Lower Bengal are also obtained at this fair. 137. It will therefore be understood that the institution of a cattle show should in time become very popular among people who breed good cattle, and it is only hoped that the good work commenced by Mr. Russell will be carried on equally successfully by the Committee to whom, I believe, he has handed over the future management. 138. Government in a letter, No. 1367, dated 16th March 1896, from the Revenue Department, sanctioned the contribution of Rs. 200 for the purpose of bestowing prizes on the best cattle. To this sum the District Board made a further contribution, by means of subscriptions, of Rs. 120, raising the total amount for prizes to the respectable sum of Rs. 320. 139. On the afternoon of the 24th March the judging commenced. The Committee was composed of(13) 144. In consideration of the enlightened manner in which the Committee received these suggestions, their earnest desire of furthering veterinary knowledge, and the able manner in which the first cattle show has been conducted, I would recommend that Government be asked to contribute Rs. 350 towards the Sitamarhi Cattle Show to be held next year. 145. My tours were of necessity very short, in consequence of my duties in the Bengal Veterinary Institution : nevertheless the following districts were visited:APPENDIX A.
