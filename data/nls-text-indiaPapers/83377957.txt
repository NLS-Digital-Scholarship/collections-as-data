A number of the cases in the Dacca Asylum are classed under Dementia, Congenital; at Patna and Dullunda under Dementia from protracted Mania.

An over-wrought excitement of the passions and affections, losses, grief, and mental anxiety are prolific causes also. No. 6. Causes of Mortality. Phthisis. Dysentery, acute. Ditto, chronic.

Dr. Wise's remarks upon the most commonly met with diseases amongst the insane inmates, and their relative mortality, are interesting. It is quite clear that in the Dacca Asylum, from the faulty and unsuitable construction of the wards, the insanes are too much crowded and huddled together, and are in the winter not sufficiently protected from the cold night air. The entertainment of nautches twice a month is afforded to the lunatics, Dr. Wise thinks, with benefit. The new ward, giving accommodation for 40 lunatics, was completed in November of 1867. Further improvements, in accommodation and enlargement of the grounds of the Asylum, have been sanctioned by the Government of Bengal, Public Works Department, letter No. 677 of the 5th February, 1868, to the extent of Rupees 40,588, for the erection of a new female ward, for additions and alterations to existing buildings, and for clearing land of houses. I consider it highly inexpedient, and necessarily interfering with the proper performance of his duty by the Native Doctor, that he should be allow- ed to carry on private practice outside the walls of the Asylum. In my letter, No. 646 of the 10th February, 1868, to the Bengal Government, I have recommended that, in accordance with the new scale of staff pay to be allowed to Native Doctors, all officers of that class attached to Lunatic Asylums should receive the higher staff of Rs. 20, in addition to the pay of their grade and rank. MOYDAPORE.( 7 ) The cost per man this year has been Rs. 89-9-1 against Rs. 102-5 in 1866, thus showing a considerable diminution. The buildings, together with the Asylum grounds, remain still very defec- tive, from their low level and liability to inundation, which defect was experi- enced to a great extent in the past year of 1867. The alterations proposed by Dr. Hutchinson do not meet with my approval, as expressed below. The ratio of mortality has been less than in 1866. Carefulness is observed in conservancy matters, and in the food, clothing, and occupation of the insanes. Improvements much needed have been sanc- tioned by Government; viz., the drainage is to be improved, the drains within the quadrangle of the male part of the Asylum are to be filled up, the outside drains are to be made shallow, the privies within the buildings are to be re- moved, and a distinct hospital is to be erected. No steps would seem, however, to have been as yet taken to alter and improve the drainage ; and this is an urgently required work. Dr. Hutchinson's remarks, under paragraph IX, about the incorrect his- tories forwarded with the insanes are noticeable; it is lamentable that this still occurs, notwithstanding the Bengal Government Circular to all Commis- sioners, No. 3390, dated 11th July, 1866, which was further circulated from this Office to Deputy Inspectors-General of Hospitals in Bengal. Dr. Hutchinson's observations on Lunar Influences on the Insanes, as also on those of Barometric, Thermometric, and Hygrometric conditions, are interesting, and worthy of being further pursued. Sergeant Frawley, who has not proved himself an efficient Overseer and Assistant to the Superintendent, has happily resigned his post. An Hospital has been provided temporarily for the insanes, by the occupation, for this pur- pose, of a part of the old Dewanee Jail. The Deputy Inspector-General of Hospitals, Dr. Dunbar, in commenting upon the Superintendent's Report, does not agree with Dr. Hutchinson's pro- posed alterations to the male Asylum building, and I think justly. There must exist necessary precautions against the escape of the insanes, which the throwing open of the quadrangle would interfere with ; and it is not proper that the insanes should be locked up and crowded into the cells at night. The verandah space should be available for them, and free to them. In the cold season jhamps or purdahs might be put up in the verandahs to guard against the cold. Dr. Dunbar, with the concurrence of the visitors, has put a stop to the recreations of loud singing and nautches pursued and allowed by Dr. Hutchin- son, conceiving that the concomitant excitement must be injurious. Moder- ate recreation of this sort is salutary; but it may possibly be over-done.
( 8 ) The visitors have made alterations in the establishment of servants, in- creasing the number of warders and diminishing gate-keepers, and removing the Darogah and two Jemadars. This appears to be judicious, by increasing the numbers of the class of servants really useful, if well looked after, viz., the warders. CUTTACK.( 9 ) No. 60. FROM THE SUPERINTENDENT, NATIVE INSANE ASYLUM, Dullunda, To THE SECRETARY, INSPECTOR GENERAL, BENGAL MEDICAL DEPARTMENT, FORT WILLIAM. Dullunda, 18th March, 1868. SIR, THE papers which I have the honor of submitting herewith will present to the Government the leading facts in the history of the Dullunda Lunatic Asylum for the year 1867, and the result of its working. The General Return, if it be compared with that of foregoing years, will be found to present several discrepancies of detail; they have arisen in the course of an attempt to make the record more exact than it has hitherto been in several points, for which purpose the case of each person has been examined anew, in preference to copying from the former Return the entries of those included in it. Admissions in the year.( 10 ) The French system introduced by Morel, in which symptoms are set aside, and names are derived only from the cause or manner in which the disease has arisen, is one which leads to a minuter sub-division of classes, and consequently to greater uniformity than any other; but it is really a classification of causes, not of varieties of disease, and embraces under one head several forms of insanity, commonly regarded as distinct. For certain purposes it is useful and accurate. Having reference to antecedents, it may illustrate the influence on the mental health of communities, of their habits and occupations, of physical diseases, of climates, or other circumstances of local geography, and of inheritance; and in this manner, if carefully followed out, may, in course of time, afford trustworthy data for preventive legislation. But on the issue of the disease, the results of treatment, the comparison of various methods, &c., &c., which, for administrative purposes, are scarcely less important, it throws no light whatever. For the risk which lies before a lunatic in every case but that of inheritance (and in some degree in that also), is found to be more connected with the form and duration of his illness, than with any antecedent circumstance. Moreover the system of Morel is quite inapplicable to a country where the simplest facts connected with the origin of a case are, in many instances, quite unascertainable; and this difficulty alone appears to me to forbid, as useless, any attempt to supersede the broad classification in use, in spite of its admitted vagueness, and the consequent want of uniformity which attends its use. Among the causes of admissions, there appears nothing of novelty or special interest. The fact which each succeeding year brings prominently forward, of the prevalence of ganja smoking as a fertile source of insanity, is as prominent as ever in the records of 1867. The districts from which the people came are shown in Table 5. In my last report, I took occasion to point out the inconvenience incurred by sending insane natives from Cooch Behar to Calcutta, which had then been recently ordered, and suggested that the Dacca Asylum was better situated for their reception. Orders have since been issued in accordance with this suggestion, and no admissions from Cooch Behar have lately been made. Table 6 exhibits the previous occupation of lunatics admitted. Some trouble has been taken to make the information here given as accurate as possible. It has hitherto been the practice, after ascertaining the caste to which each Hindu belongs, to conclude that he has followed the legitimate employment of his guild, and no other. This conclusion is fallacious; and although the greater liability of certain classes and callings to insanity, if proved to exist, will probably show no more than a greater prevalence of intemperance among them, it will well repay enquiry if this mediate connection be established. The rates per cent. of cures and transfers has been 25 against 28 last year, a difference which is attributable to the increased proportion of cases chronic on admission; for this proportion, even after making due allowance for altered nomenclature, has been exceedingly large. The cures and transfers are thus divided between the various classes of mental disease: Acute Mania ... 43 in 116 Cases Chronic Do. ... 40 in 208 Do. Imbecility ... 8 in 12 Do. Observation ... 4 in 6 Do., i. e. insanity questionable. The proportion in acute mania, considering the large number of cases of intoxication by ganja, is not large. The method of nomenclature introduced, as above described, has affected it, by removing to the Chronic class those cases not characterized by any great activity or intensity of symptom; and the same process has of course increased beyond the usual pro- portion ; the recoveries in this class, as the shortness of duration which belongs to them, is the leading element in curability.
( 11 ) It is necessary to explain that the term imbecility is applied to certain forms of cerebral weakness resulting often from intoxication, and not admitting of any more positive designations ; from it recovery is frequent. And of observation it is to be said, that the discovery of no sign of insanity is a frequent issue; the patients are discharged sane, and there is no choice but to return them as recoveries. The death-rate reckoned on total population has fallen from 18 to 13, and on the daily average number from 33 to 23. It is satisfactory to record so large a reduction of mortality. But a close examination of the medical records leaves no room to doubt that it is mainly due to the fact that lunatics have reached the Asylum, as a general rule, in better physical con- dition than heretofore. Notwithstanding that the old cases bear so much smaller a proportion to the total number in 1867, there are still 17 deaths among inmates of more than a year standing, in a total of 51, against 16 in 1866, i. e., a total of 66. Moreover, the deaths from nervous exhaustion of mania fall, with one exception, on the new admissions, and being produceable by causes independent in some degree of physical condition, point in the same direction. In a total of 197 admissions, 28 persons arrived in bad condition, and of these there died 15. The satisfaction which I derive from thus reporting the evidence of increased care on the part of district officers in despatching lunatics from the interior would be greatly enhanced, if I could point to a similar result from the many and various endeavours made from year to year to reduce the mortality which belongs more strictly to the Asylum itself; but this it is not yet permitted me to do. Nor am I able to add anything to that which has been written in former years regarding the mortality of the Asylum. In my report for 1866, I set forth fully the various changes which had been made in the life of the inmates, as suggested from time to time, and stated the reasons which led me to anticipate their results with little hopefulness. Some progress has at length been made towards increasing the accommodation of the place. The southern extensions, sanctioned long ago, are nearly completed. They will add four small rooms to the number now occupied. Compared with the requirements of the inmates, whose number has this year increased 25 per cent., this is certainly very little, but it is in the right direction ; and the larger northern extensions, it must be hoped, have been brought, by the lapse of 1867, one year nearer their commencement. The number of deaths from cachexia which has originated in the Asylum, points again, as others in former years pointed, to some essential condition of life and health wanting at Dullunda. Every known influence and agent has been examined in a restless search for the cause of mischief. Change has followed upon change, until scarcely a trace remains of the Asylum as it was eight years ago, or of the habits of its inmates. Drainage is complete. The ventilation of existing buildings leaves nothing to desire ; the diet of the people has been improved, until it savours of extravagance, and conservancy pursued until I have begun to charge myself with spending public money on fancy work; but the want of breathing space at night is still in force, if existing rules of space have any foundation. It alone remains of the known conditions of illness, and the illness of the Asylum is of the kind most readily attributable to it;( 12 ) conditions for and against the prevalence of sickness exist in both places alike, and still year after year the death-rate in one is nominal, in the other immutably high. It may be that the soil in one place is less receptive or retentive of the noxious matters which congregated numbers of men impart to it; matters which, though they are regular products of human life, are not removeable as excrement by conservancy. It is certain that on the site of the Presidency Jail the natural water level is very far from the surface, and on that of the Asylum very near to it; but the connexion between this distance and local healthiness has not yet been closely traced, and, in the absence of data, it would perhaps be wiser to refrain from speculating on evil agencies which do not admit of measurement or removal, as it can only lead to a high death-rate being accepted as an incorrigible necessity; until at least every one of the stereotyped conditions of health shall have been satisfied to the full. In my report for 1860, I drew attention to the mischievous consequences of causing lunatics to travel long distances to the Asylum, and I endeavoured to show, in a table prepared for the purpose, that the death-rate was increased in a very high degree thereby. It was pointed out by Dr. Green that the conclusion was weakened by the introduction of some cases in which long residence in the Asylum had preceded death, and others were adduced in which death took place after the lapse of some months. The latter class, I submit, were rightly included, as I stated subsequently that two distinct causes were in operation, one the well-known influence of the Calcutta climate on the health of the inland natives, the other the exhaustion of the long journey; and to the former of these classes persons who lived only a few months in the Asylum seemed rightly to belong. In paragraph 4 of the Government Resolution, dated 11th January, 1868, a desire is expressed for preparation of a table in which the period of deaths in 1867 should be separately given, with a view to illustrating the question at issue. I have accordingly drawn up a table, which, in addition to the specific information called for, supplies, I think, every statistical fact connected with the deaths, and, with certain limitations, will serve to separate the effects of the journey from those of changed climate. The arguments and conclusions supported by this table, I will now submit as they present themselves to me. In the first place, the more closely the matter is examined, the more evident does it become that, for the purpose of comparison, the cases received from Calcutta and the immediate vicinity must be excluded. These cases form a large majority of the whole, and their exclusion greatly narrows the field of enquiry. But it must be accepted, if fallacy is to be avoided, first, because very many of the so-called Calcutta cases are not residents of Calcutta, or even of Bengal, but natives of all provinces from Peshawur downwards, brought by all the variety of circumstances that create the population of a port, and caught by the town police when they have been made helpless or dangerous by the vices and poisons of the city; secondly, because Calcutta people are sent at once to the Asylum, without reference to their physical state, (provided they are not absolutely moribund.) Their insanity being established, the Asylum is for them a more fitting place than the hospitals of the town. It is close at hand, and their detention among the sick is not desirable. It follows that some are received in as hope- less a state of physical health, as they are in the pauper hospital itself, and as a class they can form no standard of comparison for lunatics from outlying districts, all of whom must be pronounced fit to travel before they are moved, and who are to this extent picked-lives. There remain only the smaller number of admissions from the nearer districts, to place by the side of those from remote places; but the results, I think, are sufficiently marked to support some very clear inferences. If I use the figures from Calcutta then in the following arguments, it is with a view of guarding myself from bias in favor of the conclusions put forth in my last report; for as there
( 13 ) are imported into the class many persons from the Mofussil with their greater liability to death, I shall of necessity fall short of the truth in representing the comparative healthiness of the whole group as that of Calcutta men. Nor is there any begging of the question here, for the greater liability of Mofussilites to death is a fact susceptible of independent proof. Again, to make the record scientifically accurate, those cases should be removed from it which cannot reasonably be connected with any avoidable cause. Nervous exhaustion must be ac- cepted as a condition to which any debilitating influence greatly conduces; but apart from this, there are( 14 ) or the results are unfavorable ; so that, although they modify, they do not contradict the collec- tive conclusions. My report on mortality will be incomplete if I do not mention that the method of treating cachexia by the free use of milk has been tried, and I see no reason to doubt that some success has attended it. It was suggested to me by Dr. Fawcus, who had obtained satisfactory results in the Alipore Jail. It is not always easy to predict the issue of a case which at the outset shews only pallor, ( 15 ) General Treatment and Management.( 16 ) REPORT OF VISITORS OF DULLUNDA LUNATIC ASYLUM.

( 41 ) FROM JAMES WISE, ESQ., M.D., Superintendent of Lunatic Asylum, To DR. H. M. MACPHERSON, Secy., Inspr. Genl. of Hospitals, Indian Medical Dept., L. P. DACCA, the 19th February, 1868. SIR, I HAVE the honor to forward herewith the Annual Returns of the Dacca Lunatic Asylum for the year 1867, together with a general Report on the management and sanitary state of the institution, for the information of His Honor the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal. Statements Nos. 1 and 2 are the Annual Return of patients treated in 1867, and its abstract. From these it appears that the total number treated during 1867 was 293. There were 77 admissions, of which 10 were re-admissions. The daily average strength was 210, or 16 below that of the previous 5 years. Thirty-four were discharged as cured, 7 were transferred to their friends, 35 died, 8 escaped, and 209 remained on the list at the end of the year. Of the 77 admissions, 7 (6 males and 1 female) were under the Criminal Procedure Code ; 70 under Act XXXVI of 1858. A decrease in the ratio of cures and transfers on the actual strength is apparent in this year's return as compared with those of former years. In 1865 the proportion was 25.85 1866 ( 42 ) admissions were only 87. The average of the last 25 years has been 96. The largest number received in any one year was 129 in 1850 ; the lowest was 63 in 1843. As might be expected, patients are generally sent in during August and September, when there is the greatest facility for transporting the sick by boats. The proportion of lunatics yearly received into this asylum is quite insignificant. Unless when lunatics are dangerous, or when the relatives are too poor or too much occupied to maintain a constant watch over them, they are kept at home. When refractory, they are bound with chains, or their feet are fastened to a heavy log of wood. They are never designedly maltreated, but when a paroxysm of excitement comes on there is too much cause for suspecting that they are inconsiderately dealt with. The rapid spread of spirit drinking among the Hindoos, and of opium eating and gunjah smoking among the Mahomedans, must lead to an increase of mental diseases ; but the returns of this asylum do not indicate any such result. The only explanation is that Section 5 of Act XXXVI of 1858 is not enforced by the police. People of unsound mind are frequently met with in Dacca and other towns, who cannot be considered accountable for their actions, and who might at any time commit a homicidal act. Such persons generally gain a livelihood by begging, and as long as they do no overt act they are permitted to wander at large. Statement No. 3 shows the type of insanity in the cases treated : 10 were cases of acute mania, 179 of chronic mania, 82 of dementia, 18 of monomania, 3 of moral insanity, and 1 of amentia. In his report on the Insane Asylums for 1866, Dr. Green remarks upon the different classification of mental diseases followed in this asylum from that adopted at Dullunda. On referring to the reports of former years, I find that Dr. Simpson in 1862 distinguished between 9 varieties of insanity. In the reports for 1863 and 1864 8 classes only are enumerated; mania being subdivided into chronic and recurrent, and dementia into primary and secondary. In the report for 1865 only 5 classes are noted, mania chronic and dementia being made to include the subdivisions of the former years. In 1866 the same nomenclature was followed. It has been found impossible to alter the classification of the present report, as the monthly returns and case books have been filled up in accordance with it. It would be easy to adopt "a uniform standard of distinction" in all asylums, but the orders on this subject are vague. The circular letter of the Medical Board, No. 25, dated 13th July 1854, leaves it to the option of the Superintendents to follow one of two classifications ; but it directs that if the minute subdivision is adopted, the varieties must be included under the 5 heads of moral insanity, monomania, mania, dementia, and amentia. The table in the revised rules of 1860 only recognises these 5 divisions. Appended to the above circular letter is an explanatory table with a minute classifica- tion of mental diseases " which may be adopted by those who choose." In the Dacca Asylum all cases have, during the last three years, been returned under 5 heads only. In the Dullunda Asylum the minute classification has been followed. For the future the Dacca returns will be drawn up uniformly with those of the Dullunda and other asylums. Statement No. 4 shows that of the 293 cases 156 were due to physical, 31 to moral causes, and that in 106 or 36.17 per cent. the cause could not be ascertained,
( 43 ) As in former reports, the largest proportion is ascribed to indulgence in gunjah The ratio from this cause in the last five years has been as follows :( 44 ) furnishing 28.37. Of the whole of the 10 females, 6 were in service, 1 was a ryot's wife, 1 a prostitute, and 2 Dhangarni women employed in tea gardens. Statement No: 7 shows that the greatest number 35 were between 30 and 40 years of age on admission, 31 between 20 and 30 ; 5 between 10 and 20 years ; 3 between 40 and 50, and 3 between 50 and 60. As natives are generally quite ignorant of their age, it is impossible to rely implicitly on these figures. During the last 25 years the ages of the lunatics on admission have been as follows :( 45 ) of worms in the intestinal canal. Post mortem examination revealed an an( 46 ) Insufficient clothing or improper diet would produce cachexia, but no change in either of these has been introduced of late years. The great alternations of temperature in December had a most injurious effect on the health of the inmates. The cells have barred windows through which the night wind blows. Those lunatics who cast aside their bedding were particularly subject to cachexia and pulmonary complaints. Curtains, made of tât or coarse canvass, are being manufactured. When ready they will be hung in the verandahs, and the wind will be prevented from blowing directly on the inmates, while the ventilation of the dormitories will not be interfered with. The great increase in the mortality from constitutional diseases of late years is to be attributed to the above causes. From 1841 to 1864 the deaths from this class of diseases averaged only 2.7 per annum, while during the last three years it has risen to 15.6 of the total mortality. As has been shown above, the deaths from zymotic or preventable diseases have decreased in a remarkable manner. The daily average number of sick in hospital during 1867 was 21.56. This does not include many who were physically unfit for work. The diseases treated were chiefly fevers, an( 47 ) 1 escaped, 4 were sent for trial, and 4 were released by order of Government, leaving 32 in the asylum on the 1st January 1868. Of the 51, 45 were males, 6 females. The crimes for which they were confined were as follows :( 48 ) Payment of expenses of Lunatics.( 49 ) mortality of the two last years, we have to go back to the year 1865. From 1855 to 1858 the mortality averaged 26.87 per annum, or 10.57 above that of 1866-67. The improved diet introduced in 1861, and the better sanitary arrangements of the asylum under Dr. Simpson's management, probably lowered the mortality, but no accurate ratio can be obtained from the books now existing. With new dormitories affording ample superficial accommodation, and with floors which would not absorb moisture, the mortality will certainly be lowered ; but until such improvements are completed, we must expect the death-rate to continue at the present apparently high ratio. I have the honor to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, JAMES WISE, M.D., Superintendent.

HUTCHINSON, M.D., Superintendent, Lunatic Asylum, To SURGEON-MAJOR H. M. MACPHERSON, Secretary, Inspector General, Medical Department, Lower Provinces. Dated Patna, January 1st, 1868. SIR, I HAVE the honor of submitting the usual Asylum Report for the year 1867, and before entering upon the history of the year, I would draw special attention to the fol- lowing objects of importance:( 72 ) This evil cannot, of course, be remedied without either raising the plinth or removing the Asylum bodily to a higher site. South. Present buildings in thick line. "Removal and extension in thin line. The ventilation of the main block of the Asylum is very defective, and necessarily so from its shape, which, being that of a large quadrangle running North and South, can only receive ventilation from the prevailing eastern and western winds. Therefore the north and south ranges of cells rarely, if ever, have a breath of air through them, as their doors and windows are all north and south, and they have dead walls to the East and west. These remarks only apply to the main block, the rest of the Asylum being admirably ventilated. To increase the accommodation, and throw open the whole building to air and sun- shine, I would suggest the following alter- ations, illustrating them by a plan of the main block. Remove entirely the north- ern and two southern rows of cells, and extend to the northern the eastern and west- ern rows of cells. This extension would exactly compensate for the removals, and we should thus have two long rows of airy and well ventilated cells, accommodating 60 patients ; and from there being no enclosing walls, there would be less risk of damp. To the north of the old Dewani Jail, I would erect two parallel blocks for 40 patients, and in the same manner extend the female block to the south, allowing accommodation for 40 patients, instead of 20, as at present. Thus the Asylum would be capable of separately accommodating 165 patients as follows :( 73 ) As usual, dysentery and diarrh(74 ) I have now in the Asylum two or three such cases; one in particular, where the patient, a Bengali lad, seems overwhelmed with a sense of his disgrace and degradation.

These I hope to commence on the receipt of the instruments I have sent home for.

D. STEWART, ESQ., Superintendent, Lunatic Asylum, Cuttack, To DR. H. M. MACPHERSON, Secy., Inspr. Genl., Medical Dept., Calcutta. CUTTACK, 23rd January 1868. SIR, I have the honor to forward the Annual Return of the Cuttack Lunatic Asylum for the year 1867, together with a general report on the conservancy and management of the institution, for the information of His Honor the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal. 1. Statement No. 2 is the abstract of the Annual Return, and shows a total of 49 treated during the year; of these 21 were fresh admissions, being 7 less than the preceding year. We have had no re-admissions. The daily average under treatment has been 33.895, being 3.805 in excess of 1866. The admissions from January to June were double those from July to December. There have been 8 discharged cured, 3 relieved and transferred to friends; 4 died, and 34 remain under treatment. Of the 21 admissions, 1 was under the Criminal Code, and 20 under Act XXXVI of 1858. 2. Statement No. 3 gives the nature of insanity of the cases treated during the year. They are as follows :( 91 ) Of the narcotics used, datura has on two occasions been noted among the exciting causes. I allude particularly to this drug in connection with the case of Bunkall, who was admitted in August under the following circumstances :( 92 ) Sickness and Mortality.( 93 ) Statement No. 11 shows the estimated value of lunatic labor( 94 ) the district and is under investigation : Bustum Doss was admitted on 29th April last with descriptive roll from Balasore, stating that one piece of dhootee was the property belonging to, and sent with, him. . On recovery Bustum Doss stated that there were many things which he had prior to being taken up by the Police as mad, that he was deprived of these, and sent on to the asylum. On writing to the Deputy Magistrate of Balasore no information was given, although duplicate copy of the descriptive roll was sent. That Officer suggested that the .authorities at Bhuddruck be communicated with. I next sent the recovered lunatic in charge of a constable, and wrote to the Assistant Magistrate of Bhuddruck requesting him to institute enquiry in the matter, as Bustum Doss led me to believe he was ill used and drag- ged while on his pilgrimage to Pooree. Both Policeman and Bustum Doss returned bringing with them Rs. 20-9-5. Before leaving us Bustum Doss gave a list of his property. This the constable verified by the diary record of the Police Station at Soroh (the Police Station where he was picked up and taken back to Balasore as insane) and at Balasore. The value of his property Bustum Doss estimate about Rs. 100. The constable brought word that the articles had been auctioned, and that the above amount was handed to him as proceeds of the sale.

No. 6. FROM THE SUPERINTENDENT OF ASYLUMS AT THE PRESIDENCY, To THE SECRETARY INSPECTOR GENERAL, MEDICAL DEPT., FORT WILLIAM, BHOWANIPORE, The 17th January 1868. SIR, I have the honor of submitting herewith the Annual Returns of the European Lunatic Asylum for the past year. In my report of the year 1866, a complete history of the institution was given from the time when it passed into the hands of Government, and of the several changes which it has been found expedient to make in the details of management from that time to the present. I pointed out the great structural defects of the place with the reasons which render it unnecessary to apply any remedy for them on a large scale, and the special circumstances which govern the admission, detention, and removal of patients, and render the statistics of the asylum valueless for comparison, or for elucidation, of the origin, progress, and issue of insanity among Europeans in India, and which preclude the introduction of an industrial system or any form of regular employment such as is attended with great advantages in the native asylum. I traced, as far as I was able, the result of despatching harmless military lunatics to Europe as ordinary invalids, and of the general removal of those of European parentage which had been carried out at my recommendation in 1863. The several measures recorded were approved, and the arguments and conclusions fully accepted by the Government of Bengal in resolution dated 22nd April 1867 ; it is not therefore
( 2 ) necessary to repeat the observations with which the figures required for the satisfaction of an office form are now presented for the year 1867. They call for little comment. The year has passed without prominent events in the affairs of the lunatics. The admissions show little, numerical difference from those of last year. Of 26 cases among the males, in which the cause was more or less ascertained, intemperance is assigned in 9. For the reason stated in my last, this attribution must be accepted with extreme caution. There is the same ground for regarding the self-indulgence in those cases as more often the early manifestation of insanity than its real cause. In 4 instances injury to the head had preceded the derangement. In 3 it was ascertained to have been hereditary. Climatic influences, venereal excesses, and distressing circumstances com- plete the list; but the number of examples of each is so small as to deprive the statement of all interest and value. Among the women grief and hereditary transmission are the only antecedents on record. The cures and transfers were 31 in number, and the deaths were 7. In an institution where a total number of less than 100 persons pass through in the year, it is of little use to convert aggregates into ratios per cent., and where the inmates remain for the greater portion of the year at a very low number, and rise only during the cold months when insane soldiers are passing to Europe, a reckoning based on the mean daily population would not rightly represent any effect or feature of the asylum system as it is. In regarding 7 deaths as a ratio of 10 per cent., the fallacy is even more apparent. In dealing with large numbers, accidents and extraordinary occurrences of various sorts are few in proportion, and, transpiring with a certain degree of uniformity, balance one another in comparative reckonings. In the present list, however, no less than 4 out of the 7 deaths would be rightly considered extraordinary, and as illustrative of nothing connected with the asylum. The mortuary figures, therefore, do no more than fill' the allotted column of the table, while a separate return of the cases with some particulars of each is appended. The removal of harmless lunatics to Europe as ordinary invalids has, as before, been attended with advantage to them and economy to the State ;( 3 ) want of the information, it has been clear that there must be no little difficulty in gathering it from the various destinations to which the people are consigned after their arrival,( 4 ) driven back for the present to the prison-like cells from which they had escaped, and of which all the repelling aspect seems now brought into greater prominence than ever. The difficulty of obtaining masons and carpenters at the present time is extreme; nevertheless, an attempt is being made to repair the loss, and some suitable structure will no doubt have been erected before the hot weather has advanced. I have the honor to be, SIR, Your most obedient Servant, ARTHUR PAYNE, M. D., Surgeon Superintendent.

READ a letter No. 197, dated 26th June 1868, from the Inspector- General of Hospitals, Lower Provinces, submitting the Annual Reports and Returns of the several Lunatic Asylums under the Government of Bengal for the year 1867. 1. The Lieutenant-Governor is glad to observe that, with the exception of the Dacca Asylum, in which there is a slight increase, the rate of mortality, calculated on the daily average treated, has decreased considerably as compared with that of the preceding year; the reduction appears to be entirely due to the absence of cholera which only caused 2 deaths against 29 last year, and the diminished violence of dysentery and diarrh( 2 ) excessive pressure taken off the available space by the erection of additional Asylums at other places, overcrowding will cease, and with it the present excessive mortality. 6. The Lieutenant-Governor has perused with interest the Table prepared by Dr. Payne to shew the effect of long journeys on the health and mortality of lunatics. It seems to show clearly enough that there is a far greater liability to death among patients that have recently joined the Asylum than among those that have been in it for some time. This seems placed beyond all doubt by the fact that with 197 admissions 34 patients of less than one year's residence in the Asylum died, while out of 190 patients previously in the Asylum only 17 died, and that out of the 34 deaths 30 happened in the first four months. But the Table does not appear to afford much support to the theory that the mortality is greater among patients who come from distant than among those who come from adjacent districts, however certain that theory may be on other grounds. The Calcutta group of districts avowedly throws no light on the theory, as the proportion of patients that arrived in a weak physical condition is greater than in the next group of districts one degree removed from Calcutta; but omitting this first group for the reasons urged by Dr. Payne, it still does not appear that the patients who have come from districts remote from Calcutta, show a mortality greater to any appreciable extent than that of those who come from the middle group of districts. Dr. Payne contends that his figures shew that from the remoter districts 25 per cent. arrived in a physically bad state, and 20.4 per cent. died, while from the less remote districts 8.3 per cent. only arrived in a sick state, and 12.5 per cent. only died (the 8.3 should be 10.8, as there were four and not three patients who are reported to have arrived sick) but this result is obviously due to the method of grouping. Hazareebaugh and Pubna are entered in both the remoter and less remote groups, while Moorshedabad and Jessore, both of which materially influence the average of their respective groups in favor of Dr. Payne's theory, are entered, the former as a remote and the latter as a less remote district. Practically Moorshedabad is more easy of access to Calcutta than Jessore is. Assuming that Hazaree- baugh and Pubna were included in the middle group by mistake, it is still difficult to understand why Moorshedabad should be regarded as a distant and Maunbhoom as a less distant district. Had the grouping been, group No. 2( 3 ) which is not likely to be denied,) but which does not support to any appreciable extent as regards the ultimate mortality. 7. The receipts from the profits of labor in the Dullundah Asylum are very satisfactory ; the value actually obtained being Rupees 8,368-2-1, besides an estimated amount of Rupees 4,437-9-5, for which no payment was received. The Lieutenant-Governor observes that Dr. Payne attributes this result to the efforts of Overseer Bancroft. The Lieutenant-Governor is also glad to notice the very excellent testimony borne to the management of the Asylum by the Inspector-General of Hospitals. 8. The report of the Moydapore Asylum, which only numbered 17 patients at the beginning of the year, and 10 at its close, needs no particular notice. The Lieutenant-Governor hopes to obviate the evil results which the Inspector-General of Hospitals anticipates from the closing of this Asylum, by obtaining sanction to keep it open till fresh Asylums have been constructed. 9. The Lieutenant-Governor approves of the alteration mentioned in paragraph 4 of Dr. Wise's report, by which lunatics who escape, are excluded from the number entered as discharged cured. The Lieutenant- Governor commented last year on the large number of escapes from this Asylum, and regrets to see that this year again there were no less than 8 escapes. The new ward for the Dacca Asylum was completed during the year, thereby enabling it to accommodate forty more patients. It appears, however, that only 87 patients were admitted during the year as against a previous average of 96 during the last 25 years. The Lieutenant-Governor observes that Dr. Wise is of opinion that the admissions form no satisfactory test of the real amount of insanity which prevails. Of this there can be no doubt. The cost of the Asylum has risen from Rupees 81 to Rupees 94 per head. This appears to have been partly due to a very disadvantageous contract entered into in the latter part of 1866 for the supply of rice at 11 seers per rupee, and partly to a general rise in prices. 10. The case of the Native Doctor attached to the Dacca Asylum has led to a reference to the proposal to grant staff allowances to Native Doctors for extra charges, including Lunatic Asylums. The question of staff allow- ances for such medical charges has been referred to the Government of India, and now awaits the decision of that Government. 11. Dr. Wise's report is interesting and instructive, and the Lieutenant- Governor notices with satisfaction the genuine interest which he and indeed all the Superintendents take in the Asylums under their charge. 12. The alterations proposed in the Patna Asylum by Dr. Hutchinson are not approved either by the Deputy Inspector-General or the Inspector- General of Hospitals. Other sanitary improvements are being separately attended to. 13. The Commissioner of Patna will be again requested to issue strict strict instructions for compliance with the orders of Government regarding histories of insane patients. 14. It is noticed that the Deputy Inspector-General of Hospitals, Dr. Dunbar, conceiving them to be injurious, has put a stop (altogether, it is presumed,) to nautches in the Patna Asylum, which were allowed by Dr. Hutchinson : on the contrary, Dr. Wise at Dacca, and Dr. Stewart at Cuttack, permit these entertainments in the Asylums of which they are in charge, and are of opinion that they are attended with benefit to the patients.
( 4 ) 15. The observations taken by Dr. Hutchinson of the effect of heat, cold, damp, and of the moon on maniacal excitement are interesting. The Lieutenant-Governor hopes that Dr. Hutchinson will continue these observations in order to ascertain whether the results of several years will confirm those which at present extend over only a single year. 16. The purchase of a weighing machine for the Cuttack Asylum, and the increase in the Warder Establishment, have been separately sanc- tioned ; the provision of separate accommodation for European lunatics is still under consideration. 17. The Superintendent of the Cuttack Asylum calculates the total cost of each patient at Rupees 113 for the year, which he states to be the same as last year. It appears, however, from Table No. 8 given at page 4 of the report, that the annual cost has, as a fact, risen from Rupees 89 to Rupees 138, an increase which requires some satisfactory explanation, allowing for the famine allowance given to the servants and for the exceptionally high prices. 18. The statements of profits of the labor of lunatics is satisfactory, but it is a point calling for further report whether, when the cost of the Asylums is borne by Government, money paid for the maintenance of patients by their friends should be credited to the Labor Fund, as has been done in the case of the Dullundah and Cuttack Asylums. The proper procedure seems to be that followed in the case of the maintenance money paid by the Cooch Behar State, as reported by the Superintendent of the Dacca Asylum, viz., to credit the amount as a set-off to the expenses of the Institution. 19. The Commissioner of Dacca will be requested to report in regard to the alleged neglect to enforce the provisions of Section 5, Act XXXVI. of 1858 in his Division, as noticed by the Superintendent. 20. The management of the European Lunatic Asylum at Bhowanipore is satisfactory. During the year under review, the admissions, male and female, were 43, which added to the number remaining over from the past year gave a total of 72. Of these 5 were discharged cured, 7 died, and 26 were dispatched to Europe, the rest remaining under treatment. The Lieutenant-Governor notices with pleasure the high terms in which Dr. Payne speaks of the Head Overseer, Mr. DeVere, and the Matron, Mrs. DeVere. Also the favorable testimony borne to the manner in which Overseer Franklyn has discharged his duties. The Native Establishment too is said to have worked well. The actual cost of the institution has been Rupees 32,939 for the year, while payments for maintenance of patients for the same period have amounted to Rupees 4,147. Sanction has been separately given to the re-construction of the garden house.

( v ) REMARKS ON THE INSANE ASYLUMS UNDER THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL FOR THE YEAR 1868. DULLUNDA.( vi ) till cured. A separate building is not required as recommended by Dr. Hutchinson. Out of 623 in all the Asylums of which the cause of the insanity was ascer- tained, more than half (332) were caused by gunjah. This must materially influence the value of the statistical returns regarding the success of the treatment. The observation on the influence of the moon are curious; but I do not coincide with his opinion that " there is no such thing as lunar influence on the insanes," and which his own tabulated statement rather contradicts, there being 89 influenced in the fortnight after the new, and only 35 after the full, moon. CUTTACK.No. 44. FROM SURGEON MAJOR ARTHUR PAYNE, M. D., Superintendent of Asylums at the Presidency, To THE DEPY. INSPR. GENL. OF HOSPITALS, PRESIDENCY CIRCLE. FORT WILLIAM, Dullunda, the 10th March 1869. SIR, I HAVE the honor of submitting herewith the several returns of the Dullunda Lunatic Asylum, and of offering the following observations on the facts which they set forth. Admissions.( 2 ) During this year, more even than in former years, it has appeared that fatal illness has not been traceable in any way to the Asylum. The relative number of persons, ill on their admission, who never recovered, is larger than it has ever been. For the purposes of a report on the administration of the Asylum, it seems neither necessary nor interesting to endeavour any further to connect with any defects the Institution may have a mortality which is clearly traceable to outside causes, It will perhaps be regarded as sufficient if I say that in every point of diet, clothing, and cleanliness and all else that is within reach and can be made to minister to the health of the people, the same course has been followed in 1868 as in former years, and that the leading defect, viz., want of accommodation, is about to be remedied. The buildings of the northern extension have been commenced, and the activity of their present progress gives promise of completion within the current year. During the year 1868, the effect of want of space has been counteracted, as far as possible, by occupying the verandahs and disallowing the presence of any one in the wards during any portion of the day. Even the meals are now taken in an outside building. It will not, of course, be supposed that the fatal cases traceable to former illness represent the entire number of persons received in a sickly state. A large proportion of these recover, as the natural consequence of removal to a place of rest, and cessation of the vice or the trouble that they have sickened under. Endeavour to increase this proportion is not allowed to relax, no sense of irresponsibility for illness that has arisen elsewhere is suffered to hinder the search for causes and remedies, nor does any suggestion of improvement pass unheeded. The Deputy Inspector General, Dr. Saunders, has proposed an increase in the daily issue of oil to the lunatics, which has been adopted, and arrangements are in progress for the partial substitution of wheat ottah for rice, in the dietary, which, I think, may bring it into closer correspondence with the former food of the people, especially in the cases of persons from the remoter districts. In table 9 the expenditure of the year is set forth under the same items as in former periods. The charge for establishment is Rs. 8,364 against Rs. 6,665 in 1867. The increase, however, which arises from the alteration from a fluctuating to a fixed establishment is not accurately measured by this comparison. The average daily number of inmates, 268, against 220, in 1867, would have led to a considerable increase under the old fluctuating scale of servants, so that with the exceptionally large muster, the fixed scale has proved to be a measure of economy. The Overseer's salary was doubled in the period under review, a matron entertained, and other changes made which have added to the efficiency of the establishment, while their cost has been counterbalanced as above. There is a slight increase in the total cost of diet, due to the augmented numbers. The general result is cost per man diminished by Rs. 2 on that of 1867, notwithstanding the increase of salary and wages of establishment.
( 3 ) The difference in contingencies, whereby the figure is nearly double that of 1867, has arisen from the introduction of brass plates for eating, the substitution of iron tanks for earthen vessels for storing water, and the new arrangements for the latrines. Clothing, bedding, &c., exhibit such difference as the numbers have made necessary. Notwithstanding that the industrial profits of 1867 greatly exceeded those of earlier years, they have been surpassed by those of 1868. In the former year, excluding the sum of Rs. 4,437 as estimated value of buildings, &c., erected and Rs. 487 credited as remaining due by the Agra Bank, the money actually received for work and produce of various kinds amounted to Rs. 3,444. This year it is Rs. 6,541. The survey report on building work shall be submitted as soon as it can be obtained. The Executive Engineer has, from pressure of work, been unable to depute an officer to measure and appraise it hitherto. The amount will be small, as the chief items composing it are new work- sheds, which were not completed when the year closed, and which will therefore appear in the reckoning of the current year. These new buildings, which the enlarging scale of work has rendered indispensable, have absorbed all the available money, and led to delay in re-paying the loan of Rs. 3,000 which was obtained from the Government during the year (on 29th October 1868) for the purposes of the oil manufacture, and expended in the purchase of seed. Similarly I have not been able, as I otherwise should have been, to commence crediting to Government the amount received for maintenance of certain patients from their friends. I hope the circumstances may save me from censure for the continuance of this irregularity. In letter No. 1944, dated 21st April 1868, His Honor the Lieutenant Governor expressed a desire for the submission of accounts showing the manner in which the funds had been expended. Such accounts have been prepared and appended to the annual tables. General treatment and management. ( 4 ) It would seem, however, that the time has now come when it may be said, without fear of outside indignation, that personal restraint is good or bad in the absolute, precisely as it is good or bad in its effect on the individual subjected to it. That there are cases in every collection of lunatics in which mischief is ob- viated, excitement tranquillized, exhaustion prevented, and unqualified advantage of every sort obtained by contrivances which effectually hinder the wild and dangerous movements of a maniac without putting him to any sort of pain or injury, is a matter which admits of no doubt; and to refrain from employing such means in such cases would be to leave the sufferers to the dictates of prejudice, and as fatal an error as to reintroduce the cruelties of the last century. It is because I fear that in reporting annually on the use of the modern non-restraint system in this Asylum, I may lead to the supposition that no person is ever to be found in the place with his limbs confined, and so to a false impression, that I desire to make mention of the subject now. Not only has it been the invariable practice to hinder lunatics, who suffer from ulcers which they injure with their hands, from doing so by confining their arms to their sides with broad bandages, but it has been occasionally thought proper to control maniacal frenzy by fixing the maniac on a mattress, with a broad sheet covering his entire body. Such a procedure is, as will be seen at once, entirely free from the objection which attaches to all contrivances which cramp or strain the joints, or otherwise produce suffering. It needs only to be guarded from being too readily and injudiciously employed, or too long continued, to become a most humane and useful measure, and this it has been found to be at Dullunda. Lately a very convenient sub- stitute for the broad sheet, in cases requiring only the prevention of exhausting movements, has been devised by the Overseer. It consists merely of a long canvas bag with a collar fitting loosely on the neck, sufficiently wide to prevent any very active or dangerous movement of the limbs, without preventing such change of posture as is necessary for relief. This bag envelopes the whole person except the head, and its edges are made fast by strong tapes to the cot on which the mattress is placed. Not only are such methods as these advantageous and free from mischief in the restraint they effect, but they can be employed in a verandah or any well ventilated place, and so the lunatic is kept free from padded rooms and other places for close seclusion which are used in Europe, but in an Indian climate are quite inadmissible. Having used the broad sheet for years in the manner I have described with good effect, it is satisfactory to find that its employment is now openly advocated by writers on the subject in England. Recent periodical literature is my authority for this statement. The visits of the Official Visitors have been regularly paid. I can add nothing to the testimony which I offered last year to the character and conduct of Overseer Bancroft. It is due entirely to schemes which he has devised, and to the constant exercise of close supervision by him, that the industrial progress
( 5 ) of the Asylum is what it is, and that regular labour is accompanied by improve- ment in discipline and health. And it is in a great measure due to his temper and judgment in the control of the native establishment, that the fair wages sanctioned in 1868 have not failed to draw a very superior class of men to the place and made the service to be earnestly sought after. Unfortunately he is greatly hampered by the office work that is thrown on him by the great variety of labour now carried out, and the multitude of petty cash transactions during the day. Work of this nature it is unsatisfactory to entrust to a native clerk, or there would be no difficulty in relieving the Overseer. Of the native doctor I have little to say that is favorable. Instead of assisting the Overseer in many matters which, though not strictly medical, might reasonably be cared for by so well paid a subordinate, he adds to the work of supervision by neglecting his own proper duty whenever he has an opportunity. I have the honor to be, SIR, Your most obedient Servant, ARTHUR PAYNE, M. D., Surgeon Major, Superintendent of Asylums at the Presidency. No. 2. Abstract of Annual Return. SEXES.

( 14 ) REPORT ON MOYDAPORE LUNATIC ASYLUM FOR 1868. Of the 10 patients remaining on date of last report, one effected his escape on the 14th September, and nine remain under treatment. No fresh cases have been received during the year. Those remaining in the Asylum are I fear hopeless cases as regards permanent recovery. There have been no deaths and the general health of the patients has been excellent. One old man is fast failing from old age. Criminal Lunatics. Only one criminal lunatic is in confinement, and I cannot report any particular improvement in his condition. His lucid in- tervals are perhaps longer. Diets. The diet has been supplied as before by the jail darogah, with the excep- tion of vegetables, which have been grown in the jail garden free of expense. All the clothing required has been paid for out of Lunatic Labor Profit Fund. Exclusive of cost of establishment, the expense of feeding each lunatic throughout the year has been Rs. 21-1-0, which is somewhat in excess of last year. Manufactures. With our diminished numbers, our manufactures have, of course, dimi- nished, but still after deducting all expenses of raw ma- terials purchased, the clear profits amount to Rs. 113-5-3, which gives us Rs. 11-5-3, as the amount earned by each lunatic. Buildings. Beyond keeping these habitable no repairs were commenced till the end of the year, when orders were received to put the Asylum in order with a view to re-opening it again to the public. The repairs are progressing and I hope will soon be completed. I have had every reason to be pleased with the conduct of the native doctor Ruttoo, in charge of the Asylum, who sees the patients get their food, and looks after their comfort in my absence. From our small establishment and limited number of insanes, it has been found impossible to keep the Asylum grounds in proper order and remove jungle, and it will take some time ere this can be effected, and before the place can regain the tidy aspect it had in 1866, when Government ordered the Institution to be closed to all fresh admissions, and the lunatics sent to Dullunda, as accommodation could be provided for them. Before the close of another year, I doubt not the Institution will be pretty well refilled and the whole place in good order. A.

Dacca, 9th January 1869. SIR, I have the honor to forward herewith the Annual Returns of the Dacca Lunatic Asylum for the year 1868, together with a general report on the management and sanitary state of the institution, for the information of His Honor the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal. Statements Nos. 1 and 2 are the Annual Return of patients treated in 1868 and its abstracts. From these it appears that the total number of lunatics treated during 1868 was 321. There were 112 admissions (90 males and 22 females), of which 13 were re-admis- sions (11 males and 2 females); the daily average of strength was 200 (166 males and 34 females); the average strength during the previous year was 210. Forty-one lunatics were discharged cured, 14 were transferred to their friends, 45 died, 8 escaped, and 213 remained on the register at the end of the year. During 1868 the admissions were 35 over those of 1867. This was caused by a misapprehension of the Order of Government No. 5431, dated 13th November 1868. Many persons whose insanity was of long standing, and whose relations were willing and able to support them, were forwarded to the Asylum; several of these have already been transferred to their friends, security being taken that they will be properly looked after. New orders have been issued, and the Police are instructed to forward only those lunatics who are of dangerous tendencies. Of the 112 admissions, 14 (all males) were under the Criminal Procedure Code; 98 under Act XXXVI of 1858. The re-admissions were less numerous than usual. During the previous five years they averaged 17 annually. Of the re-admissions, one, a gunjah-seller, came in for the seventh time. He was a thin, spare man, aged about 60 years, with a fair amount of intelligence and energy. Six were re-admitted within one year of their discharge, two within two years; two after four years ; one after seven years, and one after eight years. Of these 13 persons, six were addicted to- gunjah, four to gunjah and spirits, two to spirits alone, and the habits of one could not be ascertained. The escapes this year are the same as in 1867. Until a wall of sufficient height is: con- structed all round the Asylum, or a fence, fixed on the top of the present wall, is set up, it will be impossible to prevent lunatics from occasionally escaping. Statement No. 3 shows the type of insanity in the cases treated. The classification followed is that contained in circular memo. No. 31, dated 4th August 1868, from the Medical Department. The varied forms of insanity can with difficulty be brought under certain fixed classes. Among natives especially, the various forms of mania approximate so nearly to one another that the shades of difference become ill-defined. The temporary wild incoherent delirium, the result of gunjah-smoking, and the subsequent restless, noisy, manageable, but brief, excitement produced by the same
( 21 ) cause, cannot be classified under one and the same head of acute mania; yet there is no other class under which such cases can more properly be placed. The spirit of the above orders have, however, been implicitly followed in all the returns for 1868. Statement No. 4 shows that of the 321 cases treated, the insanity was traced in 176 to physical, 34 to moral causes, and that in 111, or 34.5 per cent., the cause could not be ascertained. Statement No. 5 shows the race and sex of the patients and the zillahs from which they came. The tea districts of Cachar and Sylhet still furnish a considerable proportion of the lunatics. This year 14 individuals (11 males and 3 females), chiefly Dhangurs, have been admitted. The cause of their insanity is generally traced to intemperance, gunjah-smoking, and debauchery. Statement No. 6 shows the trade or occupations of the lunatics admitted during 1868; the largest number, 25 or 22.3 per cent., came from the agricultural classes. Next come domestics, then beggars and tea coolies. Statement No. 7 shows that, as in former years, the largest proportion of the lunatics admitted were between 30 and 40 years of age; next in frequency were persons between 20 and 30 years, and between 40 and 50 years. Several cases of congenital imbecility have been admitted; one was a girl, aged 12, who died of cholera in December; a second, a girl, aged 17, with a large goitre, but no malforma- tion of body; and a third, a boy, aged 13, whose mental incapacity appeared to have been caused by starvation and ill-treatment. Statement No. 8 shows the causes of the mortality during the year, and the average period of confinement at the date of each death. During the year, 45 deaths, 22.5 per cent., occurred out of a daily average of 200 inmates( 22 ) constructed for only 20. The ventilation of the ward is free, the cubic space for each individual is liberal, and the tiled floor is clean and dry. As the cold weather advanced, however, it was observed that cholera was much more frequent in this ward than in any other dormitory. The only explanation of this peculiarity was that the inmates suffered from the cold night air blowing upon them from beneath the eaves of the building. As soon as this opening was closed on the northern side, sickness ceased, and the women became as healthy as the other inmates. Tubercular diseases of the lungs, as a cause of death, were more frequent than usual. Of the 10 deaths from this cause, six were males, four females; one had been 7 days, two, 2½ months; one 10 months, three 4 years; one 6 years, and two 15 years in the Asylum. The average age of the males was 38 years, of the females 43. Ten of the casualties are referred to cachexia. At the post-mortem examinations sub-arachnoid serous effusion was found in eight cases; decolorised fibrinous clots in the right side of heart in six; old pleuritic disease in two; tubercular deposit in lungs in three; gangrene of lung in one; " Nutmeg" liver in two; and congestion and ulceration of the large intestines in six. The three casualties returned as chronic meningitis might have been classed under the head cachexia; but the symptoms during life, and the pathological changes in the membranes of the brain observed after death, all indicated that the disease of which they died was a low inflammation of the meninges. The man who died of general paralysis was a most instructive case. He arrived from Kamroop on the 29th July, and he died with all the advanced symptoms of the disease on the 7th October. He was 40 years of age, an oilman by trade, and his insanity was referred to the desertion of his wife. He had several epileptic fits while in the Asylum. The right hemisphere was found after death softened and an( 23 ) perhaps more deadly than in any former year. Cholera, as has often been remarked, is more liable to appear among lunatics than among any other class of the community. Table 14 shows the greater prevalence of cholera during the last 28 years among the inmates of the Asylum than among the prisoners in the adjacent jail. This liability appears due to several causes;( 24 ) There is an increase under the heads of Establishment and Clothing; the former has been caused by the augmentation of the Superintendent's salary; the latter from the rise in the price of blankets. Under all the other heads the amount is less than in 1867. Statement No. 10 is the abstract of the estimated value of lunatic labour during the year. The daily cost of each worker has been calculated at from 1½ to 2 annas per diem. Statement No. 11 shows the amount of profit derived from the labour of the lunatics during the year; the sum of Rs. 755-9-10 was received as profits. From this amount Rs. 169-3-0 were expended in supplying extra milk to the weak and convalescent patients, and tobacco to the industrious and well behaved. Statement No. 13 is a nominal return of the criminal lunatics who have been under treatment during 1868. Of the 321 lunatics treated 45, or 14.0, were criminals. On the 1st January 1868 there were 32 in confinement, 14 were admitted during the year, four died, three were discharged, one was transferred to Burrisaul to stand his trial, one was found not to be a criminal, although he had been borne on the roll for many years, leaving 37 in the Asylum on the 1st January 1869. Of the 45 treated, 42 were males, only three females. Conduct of Establish- ment. Mr. Blackwell, the Overseer, has continued to give entire satisfaction. Through his exer- tions, the new land added on to the Asylum, which in August was covered with native houses, was by the end of the year transformed into a productive kitchen garden. He is steady in his habits and attentive to his duties. He is kind to the lunatics and manages them with tact and firmness. Native Doctor Ram Persaud Sein having resigned his appointment, his place has been filled by Native Doctor Elahi Bux. I regret that I am unable to say anything in favour of the latter officer. He is quite unfit for the post. He has been attached for years to a survey party, and his professional knowledge is therefore very defective. In addition, he is apathetic, idle, and careless of his duties. An Asylum with over 200 lunatics requires the services of an intelligent and painstaking Native Doctor, with a salary of at least 40 Rupees per mensem. This appears undeniable, and without such a resident Native Doctor the care of the lunatics cannot be properly carried on. With the keepers of the Asylum there is much to find fault with. They are, however, wretchedly paid (5 Rupees a month), and they are on duty for 12 hours out of the 24. The large majority belong to the low Mahomedan class so common in Dacca. They are very neglectful of their duties, hence the frequency of escapes from the Asylum. They are addicted to opium-eating, and in some instances to gunjah-smoking, and they have no method or tact in their management of the lunatics. To induce a better stamp of men to take service, it would be necessary to raise the pay to 6 or even 7 Rupees a month, as in the Dhullunda Asylum, and to grant a superannuation pension after long service. Occupations. During 1868 there was a daily average of( 25 ) Between August and the end of the year a large number of lunatics were daily engaged in levelling, and in filling up the wells and cess-pools in the new ground which has been added on to the old garden. By the beginning of December this land, which embraces 2½ acres, was all under cultivation, and a most productive kitchen-garden it made. This change was accomplished by lunatic labour alone. Several of the lunatics have become good gardeners, and the open air work has already had a beneficial effect on the health of those so engaged. Nautches have been regularly held every fortnight during the year. They are looked for- ward to with great eagerness. With proper supervision there is no risk of their becoming prejudicial to the lunatics. In the long evenings of the cold season any amusement which breaks in upon the monotonous life of the inmates must have a beneficial influence on their mental condition. Payment of the main- tenance of lunatics. The want of any national game in which young and old can participate is a great draw- back in India to the treatment of lunatics. During 1868 the sum of Rs. 95-4-0 has been received and credited to Government. From the Rajah of Cooch Behar Rs. 65-12-0 were sent for the maintenance of lunatics belonging to his territory. The man who was admitted for the seventh time, voluntarily paid Rs. 21 for the expenses of his subsistence while in confinement. The re- mainder, Rs. 8-8-0, was recovered by the Magistrate of Backergunge from the estate of a rich Talookdar of that district. It is only in exceptional cases that the expenses of the lunatic can be realized. The classes who furnish the majority of the inmates of Asylums are poor, and are unable to support the family, as well as to defray the expenses of the lunatic. Sanitary state of the Asylum. In April the Executive Engineer commenced to construct a large new ward with 20 cells, which will be capable of accommodating 40 female lunatics. Owing to the want of materials, this building has been advancing slowly, and at the end of the year it had only been raised above the level of the ground. The alterations in the doors and flooring of the solitary cells have also been delayed, and at the end of the year only seven had been finished. These cells, with their ornamental iron doors and asphalt flooring, will be healthy quarters when compared with the old badly ventilated apartments which they supersede. The accommodation for the male lunatics has been very inadequate during the year. At the time cholera was at its worst, many of the dormitories were dangerously crowded. On re- ducing the numbers to a safe standard, it was found that 100 were without any accommodation, and it was necessary to place them at night in the verandah, where they were exposed to cold and damp night air. The better health enjoyed by the lunatics after the Jail Hospital was given up to them, shows that one of the chief wants in this Asylum is sufficient room for the inmates. As the new buildings are completed, and the altered cells become available, the mor- tality among the lunatics will in every likelihood be reduced, and the Asylum become a com- fortable and healthy residence for the insane population of Eastern Bengal. It certainly cannot be said to have been so in the past. While the criminals of the country have been provided with good quarters, the unfortunate lunatic, whose charge Government has acknow- ledged to be a State duty, has been crowded into cells half the size of that allotted to the criminal, or into wards where one third of the number ought to be confined. This neglect is at present being made up for, and even now in this Asylum several of the wards are airy, clean, and favorable to health. 7
( 26 ) The Asylum has been inspected monthly by the Official Visitors, who take great interest in the wellbeing of the lunatics. The Asylum was also inspected by Dr. Mouat, Inspector General of Jails, on the 6th December. DACCA, JAMES WISE, M. D., The 12th January 1869. Superintendent.

( 35 ) FROM SURGEON R. F. HUTCHINSON, M. D. , Superintendent, Lunatic Asylum, Patna, To THE OFFG. SECY., INSPR. GENL., MEDL. DEPT. Dated, Asylum, 1st January 1869. SIR, I have the honor of submitting the Asylum Report for the past year, and am happy to say that in every respect it is most favorable. II. I drew attention, last year, to the over-crowded state of the Asylum, and suggested certain additions and alterations; in accordance with which, three large open sheds are to be added, two to the male, and one to the female asylum; and the southern cross-row of cells in the main block of the male asylum is to be removed, securing thus a thorough, and much needed, ventilation. During the past year a hospital has been added, and two buildings have been converted, respectively, into an office and a store-room, both being greatly wanted. Throughout the male asylum saucer drains have been substituted for the deep ones, and great benefit has accrued from laying down a coating of tar and ashes throughout the whole asylum. Thus, when the additions and alterations are fully carried out, we shall have the Asylum as healthy and comfortable as its bad site and old-fashioned plan will admit of. III. The past has been a remarkably healthy year, and I am most thankful to say that we entirely escaped cholera, though it was ravaging up to our gate, and carried off one of the keepers; and we have similarly escaped that other scourge( 36 ) As valuable accessories, I would include the daily wash and bath; a certain amount of work coaxed, not exacted, from each patient; innocent amusements, as the nautch, tom-tom, and occasional wrestling matches; the distribution of little luxuries, as sweetmeats, fruits and cigars; and frequent conversations with individual insanes, in which you hear the same story, or listen to the same grievance, real or imaginary, perhaps, for the hundredth time. Nor must I omit to allude to two, by no means trifling, adjuvants: last year I pickled several thousand limes and issued them as a relish to the food, and during the sickly months each insane had a daily drachm of fresh powdered charcoal mixed with a little water. V. In my last report I alluded to my intention of preventing the adulteration of flour by grinding it on the premises; this is now done, and four mills are busily at work in the female asylum, providing pure flour and soojee, not only for home consumption, but for outside sale. The females also manufacture all the charcoal tickeeas which are used in the Asylum. VI. The manufactures carried on by the insanes have progressed very favorably during the past year, and have included brick and tile making and soorkee pounding, carpentering, the oil mills, weaving dosootee, blankets, jharuns and tat, making tape and woollen rugs, and working in the garden. These items have yielded a clear profit of Rs. 1,038-3-6 against Rs. 917-6-4 of last year, and the estimated value of our labor has been Rs. 2,708-13-4 against Rs. 1,057 for 1867. During the year we constructed with our labor and material a large and roomy dining or sleeping shed, which will serve as a model for those to be erected under the sanctioned extension. VII. Though our daily average strength has been 162 against 130, our annual expendi- ture has diminished instead of increased, the average cost of each insane being Rs. 63-11-4 against Rs. 89-9-1 last year. VIII. As usual, I find that the majority of admissions is due to indulgence in gunjah or bhang, and of these a great number should never be sent to an asylum at all; the mere fact of a man being found reeling about under the influence of cannabism affords no more ground for his being sent to a Lunatic Asylum, than if the same man were simply under the influence of spirituous liquors. If existing laws were properly attended to, such mistakes would not so frequently occur. Act XXXVI affords full protection, but then the Police do not wait to find out whether the person be a lunatic, and thereby dangerous, and the personal examination by a Magistrate is, I fear, more honoured in the breach than in the observance. Were it otherwise, descriptive rolls would not be sent in either altogether blank, or filled up with contradictory nonsense. The medical certificate, the most important of all the docu- ments, is too often carelessly filled in, and fails to afford any information. Thus, in two cases out of many( 37 ) beyond the walls, and its establishment be furnished from the asylum; and I believe that its presence would greatly diminish the number of admissions into the Asylum proper, and thereby lessen its expenditure. X. Seeing that so many of the cases admitted into our asylums result from over indulgence in gunjah or bhang, and are not really cases of insanity, I find some difficulty in classing them, and accordingly venture to suggest that all such cases be included under the head of Cannabism; they are easy of recognition, and the following characteristics will assist in determining them. In a recent case the conjunctivæ are congested, the pupils generally contracted, and the countenance wears a peculiar leery look, which, when once seen, is unmistakable. The pulse may or may not be accelerated, and there is a marked unsteadiness in the gait; great volubility or continued indulgence in laughter or song. If the muscular system is greatly excited, there is a tendency even to rush wildly onwards in a straight line( 38 ) I think, therefore, that it may be considered a settled thing that there is no such thing as lunar influence on the insane, and that there is no such person as a lunatic.

In my report for 1866, I drew attention to the inadequacy of the Asylum Establish- ment to a daily average of 121; I feel it more than ever now, with a daily strength of 162, and strongly recommend an entire remodelling; the great obstacle lies in the small pay allowed to the various servants. When the regulations were originally framed, supplies were abundant, and Rs. 4 would suffice as monthly pay to a keeper; the case is now widely different, and I
( 39 ) experience great difficulty in getting good men at the present small rates of pay. The con- servancy department gives us most trouble; the only way open to me of keeping the mehters to their work is to fine them, and if I do so, they abscond, because they can easily get more pay beyond the Asylum walls, and so I have no hold on them; the same remark applies to the keepers, who get now Re. 1 extra, i. e., Rs. 5 per mensem, but can easily get more outside. Another difficulty lies in the non-permanency of the establishment, which, according to regulation, must vary with the strength; accordingly there is always a risk of those at the bottom of the list of servants being taken off and on according as the patients decrease or increase; how then, under such circumstances, can an efficient staff be maintained? for a ser- vant will naturally not care to learn the duties of a post which can only be temporary. XIII. I observe that the establishment is fixed, and irrespective of strength, in the Dullunda Asylum, and that the wages of the servants are relatively much higher than ours ; thus its mehters receive Rs. 7 each, while ours draw only Rs. 4, and its keepers receive Rs. 8, while ours draw Rs. 5 per mensem. There is no necessity whatever of assimilating the pay of the two establishments, but I would strongly recommend the remodelling of ours on a per- manent footing, with a slight increase of pay to the various members. And especially would I urge the appointment of a matron to the female Asylum. For the sake of convenience I append a statement of the present and proposed establishment. PRESENT.

OF HOSPITALS, INDIAN MEDL. DEPT. Cuttack, the 30th January 1869. SIR, I have the honor to forward herewith the Annual Returns of the Cuttack Lunatic Asylum for the year 1868. 2. At the close of last year, 34 patients remained under treatment, 16 have been admitted since for the first time, and 1 has been re-admitted, making a total of 51 treated of those, 8 have been discharged cured, 3 improved and handed over to their friends, and 4 have died, leaving 36 on 31st December 1868 under treatment. 3. The percentage of deaths to that of average strength is large, and will require some explanation; one was a leper, who, when admitted on the 4th August 1866, had lost several of his fingers; the disease continued and increased somewhat rapidly until 22nd June 1868, when he died. 4. The second was that of a patient who was received from Sumbulpore in a dying state, suffering from dysentery and general anasarca ; he was ill when he left Sumbulpore, and so weak that he had to be carried all the way to Cuttack by bearers ; he became daily weaker, the anasarca increased, and he died 16 days after his admission. 5. The third death was that of a poor idiotic patient, who was transferred from the jail hospital at the request of the Magistrate. When he was received the legs and body generally were ( 51 ) 9. The profits from labour will be seen, in Table No. 10, to amount to Rs. 984-11-7. In a small asylum such as this, no large works can be undertaken. I trust, however, that 1869 will show a larger amount of profit from lunatic labour. 10. A new building for European patients is being rapidly constructed by the Executive Engineer, and orders have been issued for separate wards to be built for noisy and violent patients; this last is much needed. I intend to use the European ward for violent Native patients as soon as it is completed, as there is at present no European patient in the asylum. 11. The wards are kept clean, and are regularly fumigated. Dry-earth system of conservancy is carried out fully. 12. The establishment consists of the Superintendent, one head-keeper, one Native aoctor, one compounder, seven under-keepers, one chupprassee, one cook, one bhistee, one mehter, one mehtranee( 52 ) No. 3.

D., Supdt. of Asylums at the Presidency, To THE SECY., INSPR. GENL., MEDICAL DEPT. Bhowanipore, the 15th January 1869. SIR, I have the honor of submitting herewith the Annual Returns of the Bhowanipore Lunatic Asylum for the year 1868. There were 62 admissions during the year and 1 re-admission against 44 in the preceding year. Intemperance is the cause assigned in 11 cases, but this must be accepted with the reservation which I have indicated in former reports, as it is always doubtful whether excess has not been due in any case to the loss of self-control which is one of the earliest effects of incipient madness. In 9 instances hereditary transmission has been traceable. This number is probably far from representing the cases in which the cause has been actually present, but the impossibility of ascertaining the point in the majority of cases forbids any further assignment of the cause. Sunstroke and climatic disease have preceded insanity in four cases; ill-treatment in two; and excessive study, grief, and childbirth, have each produced a single case. In the rest the cause has not been ascertainable. The chronic character of almost all the cases admitted is worthy of remark as in former years. A single case of acute mania appears, and in it the disorder was of hereditary kind, so that the appropriateness of the name is doubtful even here. Mania, that is general insanity with more or less excitement, greatly predominates over other forms of derangement. Melancholia is rarely seen, and though dementia is occasionally met with in the asylum as a primary mental disorder following climatic fever, it generally appears as a secondary result of mania. Twelve patients were discharged cured, five were so far improved as to admit of their being transferred to the care of friends, and seventeen were despatched to Europe as ordinary invalids; twenty-eight were sent to Europe as lunatics. It should be observed, however, that from this record of cures is excluded all those which are subjected to, that which is confessedly the most powerful curative measure at command, viz., removal from the country. For the reasons given in former reports, I am unable to state numerically the results which attended the despatch of patients in 1868, but from such items of information as I have received, it is evident that they have been as satisfactory as in other years. The mortality was, as usual, very small, and the notes appended to the cases will show that they arose from causes which were in no case preventible in the Institution. In my last report I mentioned the damage which the buildings had sustained from the Cyclone of 1867. This has since appeared to have been much greater than was then known, and the effect of the heavy rains of 1868 on the foundations has been to reduce the centre building to a state of dilapidation. The several barrack ranges too are greatly injured, and their decayed condition has become daily more and more manifest. It is not necessary to enter more fully into particulars here, as the reconstruction of the asylum has been pronounced ab- solutely necessary by the Officers of the Public Works Department, and plans are now under consideration. Meanwhile, all works of petty repair and construction, including the restoration of the recreation shed in the garden, have been suspended.
( 57 ) The receipts on account of paying patients during the year have amounted to Rs. 2,676 against Rs. 2,091 in 1867, and there is to be credited on account of deductions from soldiers' pay Rs. 1,198. The claim against Mr. Kallonas is still unadjusted with the Asylum, but it is understood that the realization of the money by the Collector of Backergunge is in progress, and as sufficient time has now elapsed, application will shortly be made to him for the proceeds. There are other outstanding debts to the amount of Rs. 1,210, some portion of which, at least, it is feared, will prove to be irrecoverable. The total expenditure during the year, including passage money and sea outfits, was Rs. 56,170, of which Rs. 22,157 was incurred for passages and outfits. Rupees 21,306 were expended on establishment, including the Superintendent's salary. The cost of actual maintenance per man per month (including establishment) was Rs. 29 without deduction for sums received in payment. I have again to report, in terms of the highest commendation, the services of the Head Overseer and Matron. The accommodation of the place, reduced by the destruction of build- ings, has placed them in a position of much difficulty and discomfort, but they have found in it only the greater occasion for activity and care in watching over the inmates, and by this only has the continued occupation of the premises been possible. Overseer Franklin has dis- charged his duties in a very exemplary way. On no occasion has his conduct been the subject of any but favorable notice. With the Native establishment also, I have every reason to be highly satisfied. I am about to submit a proposal for increasing their pay, which has become indispensable. At the time of my last report, I thought it would have been impossible to avoid this so long as it has been avoided, and I should be glad to have deferred it until the plans for a new asylum had been settled, as, no doubt, some further change will be necessary when reconstruction takes place; but I find myself compelled at once to take steps to improve the very inadequate wages which the servants now receive. I have the honor to be, SIR, Your most obedient Servant, ARTHUR PAYNE, Surgeon Major, Supdt. of Asylums at the Presidency. Detailed Report of Fatal Cases during the year 1868. NAME. Age.

(RESOLUTION.) MEDICAL. Fort William, the 6th July 1869. READ a letter, No. 247, dated 23rd ultimo, from the Inspector-General of Hospitals, Bengal Medical Department, submitting the Annual Reports and Returns of the several Lunatic Asylums in the Lower Provinces for the year 1868. 1. The total number of insanes admitted and re-admitted into the various Asylums shews a considerable increase over the figures for last year (429 as against 372), but there is also a corresponding increase in the number cured and transferred to friends (from 177 to 278). The percentage of cured and transferred to friends to total treated stands at 25.71 as against 18.71 in 1867. The percentage of mortality to total treated has improved from 11.31 last year to 9.52, a lower figure than that obtained in any year since 1863. The percent- age of mortality to daily average strength stands at 15.25 as against 17.74 in 1867. These results are decidedly favorable. The separate Returns of each Asylum will be examined below; but it may here be noted that Patna exhibits the most satisfactory results, the ratio of mortality to daily average strength having been there 3.70 as against 11.11 in Cuttack, 17.91 in Dullunda, and 22.50 in Dacca. The decrease in the general percentage of mortality would have been more marked but for the outbreak of cholera at Dacca, to which 15 out of 103 deaths were owing 2. The extraordinary influence of intoxicating drugs in producing various forms of insanity in India is seen from the fact that 1 out of every 2.67 cases treated was attributable to this cause. Out of 1,079 cases the causes of insa- nity were unknown in 522. 3. The average yearly cost of maintenance has risen from Rupees 93-3-3 to Rupees 95-0-2, and that in spite of a considerable reduction of cost at Patna (from Rupees 89-9-1 to Rupees 63-11-4), and slight reductions at Dullunda and Cuttack. The increase at Moydapore, from Rupees 55-4-0 to Rupees 88-4-1, is due to a diminution in the number of patients. Same explanation should be given of the differences in the cost of diet in the different Asylums as shown on the margin. Rs. As. P.

No. 53. FROM THE INSPECTOR-GENEEAL of HOSPITALS, INDIAN MEDICAL DEPARTMENT, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL. Dated Fort William, the 12th April 1870. SIR, I HAVE the honor to submit an abstract of the statistics of the lunatic asylums in the province of Bengal for the year 1869, with remarks. The several annual reports and returns are printed in full. To follow a former custom I insert a comparative statement of all the native institutions for the last seven years :( ii ) In the report for 1868 there was an increase in the daily average number of inmates of 72 as contrasting with 1867. The present year shews an increase of 46.2 from the preceding. The number of admissions was the same, being 390 in 1868, 391 in 1869; but re-admissions during the present year were as 6.9 per cent. to the total admissions, against 10.0 in the preceding year. The discharged cured shews a ratio per cent. to total treated of 16.0 in 1869, against 21.09 in 1868; while the relation of improved and transferred to the same total shows 5.3 per cent. in 1869, against 4.6 in 1868. The total of both kinds of discharge is 21.4 per cent. in 1869, against 25.7 per cent. in 1868. The ratio per cent. of deaths to treated, which was 9.52 in 1868, is 10.2 for the present year, though the ratio per cent. of mortality to the average daily number of inmates( iii ) No. 3.

The medical officer of the Dacca Asylum at first classified 123 cases under the cause ' gunja and spirit :' on a reference the present division was made. But Mr. Cutcliffe still holds that the causes are not really separable( v ) The ratio per cent. of mortality to average daily number of inmates, 15.6, has varied but little from the 15.2 of 1868. Cholera in the latter year gave 14.5 per cent. of the deaths, against 15.9 per cent. in the present year. The disease caused mortality at Dullunda, Dacca, and Patna this year, whereas during 1868 Dacca was the only asylum attacked. The table shews that 40.7 per cent. of the total mortality arose from diseases of the nervous system, and by the debility or cachexia engendered by those complaints. Scrofula and its allied complaints formed 13.2 per cent of the total. No. 6.

The large proportion of profit gained at Dullunda, column 5, is to be noted in reference to the remarks of the Deputy Inspector-General of Hospitals, on the relation of food to labor, in his memorandum and annual inspection report. The average cost in the asylums at Cuttack, and at Moydapore, under the heads of columns 6, 8, and 9, is higher than that of other institutions( vi ) REMARKS ON THE SEVERAL ASYLUMS. Dullunda.( vii ) Dr. Hutchinson was obliged to leave on account of sickness, and was succeeded by Dr. Allen in July, who found the establishment in a very unsatisfactory state from the mis- conduct of Mr. overseer Manson, whose incapacity and irregularity of conduct led to his dis- missal, and whose successor had not joined when the report was forwarded. It is intended to appoint his wife the matron should she prove efficient. This is an excellent plan. The asylum is in good order, with ample accommodation for the inmates. Cuttack.No. 41. FROM SURGEON-MAJOR ARTHUR PAYNE, M.D., Superintendent of Asylums at the Presidency, To THE DEPY. INSPR.-GENL. OF HOSPITALS, PRESIDENCY CIRCLE. FORT WILLIAM, Dullunda, the 1st January 1870. SIR, THE returns and tables which I have the honor of submitting for the informa- tion of the Inspector-General and Government, set forth in figures the statistical facts of the Dullunda Asylum for the year 1869, and such details of its management, financial and other- wise, as can be reduced to tabular form. Population.2 DULLUNDA ASYLUM. attendant physical debility. On the whole it has appeared to me that the sanitary condition of the asylum has improved much of late, and this improvement is measured by the decrease and more tractable character of this cachexia. How far this is to be ascribed to internal changes, I cannot satisfactorily ascertain. Improved condition on admission is of prime importance in inquiring into the cause, and doubtless affects this year's figures in common with those of 1868. It will be in your recollection that in the month of August you made an inspection of the inmates with especial regard to their physical condition. You found in the blueness of the gums which was perceptible in many of them what you considered to be evidence of a scorbutic taint, the result of insufficient diet; and you sanctioned a reformed dietary scale for future use. An exceedingly liberal diet was supplied from that time, including a daily issue of meat or ghee to each person. Arrangements had been previously completed for the pre- paration of atta chuppatties in lieu of a portion of the rice in daily use, and the scale now adopted is, I believe, more ample, and in quality more complete, than in any other institution, and contains every thing that can be thought useful. Several of the lunatics are unable to consume the rations allowed to them. The events of the ensuing year will shew the effect of this change on the mortality of the asylum. It would be premature now to offer an opinion on the subject. During the short time that has elapsed since the change took place, there has been no decrease of death. It is not to be expected under the circumstances that there should be such. Even if the men then in a cachectic state, and doomed to die before the year was ended, had owed their condition solely to defective diet, and crowding were in no way concerned in producing it, it would be scarcely reasonable to expect their restoration. It is not to them, nor to the cases of serious illness on admission, that regard must be had in estimating the value of the food; but to the class which having once had fair health in the asylum, have lapsed into debility of this particular kind; and diminution of these cases can only be made clear by prolonged observation. Meanwhile, though not myself sanguine in expecting any material improvement, because, as you are aware, I ascribed much of the sickly condition to insufficient space, and did not consider the former dietary defective, I cannot blind myself to the fact that the healthier men have gained in flesh and general appearanceDULLUNDA ASYLUM. 3 of it extra articles and hospital comforts are exacted from the contractor under an equitable system which prevents the multiplication of bills. In this manner excellent milk4 DULLUNDA ASYLUM. Under the head of workshop sales, a sum of Rs. 1,024 may be observed. A forge was set up and a carpenter's shop some time ago. From the proceeds a carpenter and smith are employed as instructors ; and it has happened in several instances that among the inmates, artisans whose skill was unknown before, on seeing their accustomed work going on, have declared themselves at once, and become useful and profitable workmen. Various articles of manufacture and repairs of furniture, &c., have produced the profit entered in the return. During the year a good deal of outside employment has been found for the lunatics. Parties of laborers have been engaged by the officers of the telegraph yard, and the draining and levelling of the site of the Alipore Lock Hospital were executed entirely by them. The pecuniary result appears under the head of " lunatic labor," which also includes some small sums received from the Public Works Department on account of alterations in the main buildings carried out by the inmates. Buildings.DULLUNDA ASYLUM. 5 create the habits that are required in the asylum. There cases of illness are brought to the hospital or to the notice of the subordinate, whose business it is to attend only where his attention is called for. Here he is mainly useful in spontaneously searching for illness among the inhabitants of the place, without which search it often progresses unknown. To keep up an unremitting search for illness throughout the day is a practice which does not commend itself to the understanding or the inclination of a man who is accustomed to consider his day's work done, or nearly so, when the surgeon's visit is over; and I do not wish to detract from the high character which Sheikh Bahadoor earned as a regimental native doctor when I say that he has disappointed me in his manner of discharging the peculiar duties of the asylums. The conduct of the native establishment has been excellent. Slowly progressive change has taken place under the present scale of wages in the class of men who take the service. Some of the new men had served in various capacities under the overseer in the horse artillery in former years. A few are Punjabees who have taken their discharge from regiments quartered in the neighbourhood, and being contented with the service, have summoned others from long distances. The general result is that a staff of servants very different from, and in every respect greatly superior to that of former days is in course of formation, and there is every prospect of its easy recruitment, as there are now always a few probationers about the place waiting to be employed. It is perhaps beyond the scope of a report on the asylum, but I am unwilling to conclude without expressing the obligation under which I lie to Captain Eckford, of the Telegraph Department, for the great assistance he has rendered me during the year. The arrangements of the cook-room required improvement, but to make them thoroughly good was beyond the manufacturing means at my command. Heavy iron castings were required, as well as some skilled advice, all of which were most readily furnished under Captain Eckford's orders. By the contrivances adopted, a very perfect method of cooking has been introduced with a saving of fuel which brings the consumption of coal below the quantity per man which the most approved appliances in use in England require. For much similar assistance in smaller matters, as well as for the profitable employment of lunatics in the telegraph yard, the institution is indebted to the same establishment. I have the honor to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, ARTHUR PAYNE, M.D., Surgeon-Major, Superintendent of Lunatic Asylums at Presidency. MEMORANDUM by the Deputy Inspector-General of Hospitals, Presidency Circle, in forward- ing the report to the Inspector-General of Hospitals,6 DULLUNDA ASYLUM. these insanes were not sufficiently well nourished, and advised an improvement in the nutritive value of the diet. This has been done, and, as the superintendent informs us, the more healthy inmates of the asylum have gained in flesh and general appearance. Of course more time is required to benefit those who were previously in an anæmic or cachectic state, and it may be that many of these poor people will require additional care and special advantages before they are considered to be in a good state of physical health; but I am clearly of opinion that overcrowding has had little to say to the general ill health which has been commented on, and I feel equally certain that the best way of improving the general health of the insanes is to feed them liberally and well. More space is required in the asylum wards, but space alone will not, I think, have the effect of lowering the death-rate unless we avail ourselves of the aid which we know we can rely on in an improved dietary. Overcrowding usually induces disease of a different type from that which has been observable at Dullunda of late years. A good deal of work is performed by the insanes at Dullunda, and every author of a work on hygiene admits that men must be fed in proportion to the amount of work which they are called upon to do. At Dullunda the evil effects of overcrowding are in a measure obviated by allowing many of the insanes to sleep in the verandahs, and in the daytime they are occupied in the work-sheds, or the open air in fine weather. The general conduct of the asylum has been excellent. G. SAUNDERS, Deputy Inspector- General. THE annual inspection report by the Deputy Inspector-General of Hospitals is as follows:DULLUNDA ASYLUM. 7 meat, and to record my opinion in the visitors' book to that effect. The general health of the insanes at Dullunda is a subject which has occupied my attention for some time, and in my opinion it is the object of greatest interest at the present moment of any connected with this institution. I again very recently made a careful examination of all the men and women under confinement in this asylum, to ascertain if any improvement had taken place in their general health since August 1869. In the first place there is less scurvy, and those who are in fair health are (as Dr. Payne says) I think in better condition than they were last year; but more than a fourth, I should think, of the whole body have now clear indication of scurvy, not what Dr. Payne alludes to in his report as a blueness of the gums, but a swollen, suppurating state of the gums, with recession from the teeth; the latter in many instances having fallen out. I noticed also that very many of the insanes are exceedingly anæmic and cachectic, and there is no doubt in my mind that the conditions noted above are closely related to the large and still exceptionally heavy death-rate at Dullunda. My own belief has been placed on record over and over again, that the system of dieting carried on for a long time in this asylum was a thoroughly inadequate one in relation to the amount of actual labor performed. Taking fully into consideration the opinion recorded by the superintendent of the asylum regarding the necessity for greater space, and fully agreeing with him as to the deleterious effect of overcrowding in jails, barracks, or asylums, I say that no amount of space at this institution will efface the marks of the disease without an improved dietary, and perhaps also a more careful system of labor. The subject is so momentous a one, that I offer no apology for again referring as I have done to this vital question, the due and proper amount of nourishment required for these poor creatures in relation to the work done by them. I have elsewhere, when inspecting other asylums, alluded to the labor question, and recorded my belief that in the majority of cases light work, such as cloth manufacture, is much more suited for lunatic employment than pounding soorky or manufacturing oil. In one case the labor is light and the exposure to climate is small, and consequently the expenditure of vital force is inconsiderable; in the other, all the circumstances of his daily life are against the insane. At Dullunda the ill effects of overcrowding are practically reduced to a minimum by the doors at night being thrown open and the verandahs being occupied; and again if anæmia and scurvy exist (as they do) how are these produced by over- crowding ? Overcrowding will most certainly originate disease, but disease of a different type ; whilst scurvy is everywhere known and recognised as a dietetic disease. I am convinced that exceptional mortality can only be checked at Dullunda by a careful re-consideration of the subject of diet in connection with labor. It is a significant fact that the simplest sores at Dullunda heal with difficulty, and here again I say is an evidence of low vitality, resulting from what ?8 DULLUNDA ASYLUM. India indulges in an intoxicating drug which he knows will produce maniacal excitement, and he escapes all future punishment (except confinement in a lunatic asylum) on the ground of insanity. The drunken native is no more mad than the drunken Englishman: why then this difference in the punishment awarded ? I think I could point out several (so-called) criminal lunatics at Dullunda who have never shewn any signs of insanity, and who have never been insane, though they have suffered from the stimulating and destructive effects of bhang, churrus, or other intoxicating agent. I would add that the conduct of all the officials at the asylum has been, I believe, most satisfactory. Dr. Payne does not seem satisfied with the conduct of native doctor Shaik Bahadoor, but he is an excellent man, and was selected by me quite on account of his excep- tionally good conduct and character. I appointed him to the asylum in place of a man who was notoriously inefficient and untrustworthy, and I believe this man (Shaik Bahadoor) will be found to be all that he should be in time. The duty is a new one, and it is difficult to meet with any native subordinate who will do all that Dr. Payne points out as the native doctor's duty, uninstructed. For such instruction time is required. G. SAUNDERS, Deputy Inspector- General. No. 2. Abstract of annual return. SEXES. Remaining 1st January 1869. Admitted for the first time. Re-admitted.

CUTCLIFFE, F.R.C.S., Officiating Civil Surgeon of Dacca, and Superintendent, Lunatic Asylum, Dacca, To DR. BUCKLE, C.B., Officiating Deputy Inspector-General of Hospitals, Dacca Circle. Dated Dacca, the 21st January 1870. SIR, I HAVE the honor herewith to enclose the annual returns of the Dacca Lunatic Asylum for the year 1869, and to submit the following report for transmission, in the usual manner, to the Government of Bengal. I. From table No. 2, which is an abstract of the annual return of 1869, it will be seen that there were during the year 90 patients admitted for the first time, and 9 re-admissions, which with 213 remaining at the beginning of the year show a total of 312 treated during the year. The daily average number of inmates was 231.76, which is 31.53 above that of the year 1868. Twenty-nine were discharged as cured, 6 were transferred (2 to their friends and 4 to stand their trial), 7 escaped, 41 died, and 229 were remaining on the 1st January 1870. Of the 90 new admissions, 22 were detained under the Criminal Procedure Code, and 68 under Act XXXVI. of 1858. The number of patients " cured or transferred to their friends" during the year 1868 amounted to 55; in 1869 this number fell to 35. The decrease is attributed to several causes: 1st, the Dacca Asylum has become somewhat choked with incurable cases16 DACCA ASYLUM. all punishment, and become, as lunatics, burdens on the State. Whenever it is possible, the cost of their maintenance is recovered from them or their friends; but justice seems to demand something more than this, even though the difficulties of the law may stand in the way. IV. Table No. 5 shows the castes and sexes of the patients admitted during the year, and the zillahs from which they were received. 38 were from Dacca, 12 from Tipperah, and 15 from Sylhet; 15 from the Assam Provinces, and the remainder from the other districts. V. Table No. 6 shows the trades or occupations of those who were admitted into the asylum. The agricultural class, as usual, stands highest in its numbers. VI. Table No. 7 shows the ages of the patients admitted during the year. In the decennial period 30 to 40, forty patients, or 40.40 per cent. of the whole number, and between the years 20 to 30, twenty-nine, or 29.29 per cent., were admitted. VII. Table No. 8 shows the causes of mortality and the duration of confinement at the period of death. The total number of deaths was 41, or 13.14 per cent. of strength. Last year 45 died, or 14.01 per cent. of strength. The average period of residence of each lunatic that died in 1869 was 3 years, 7 months, and 16.58 days. But as I wish to make some remarks on the subject of mortality in the Dacca Lunatic Asylum, I have had table No. 10 prepared with a view to show at a glance the causes of death, the total per cent. of deaths to strength, the mean average temperature of each month in the year, and the accommodation which the asylum has been capable of affording. I have endeavoured to make this return conform as nearly as possible to the arrangement in the new nomenclature. Pathologically considered, however, there is in the question of causation of death much that is, to say the least of it, very coarse. First, I would premise that the causes herein noted make no reference to the insanity of the individual, which, how- ever, is an actual condition of disease, and one, too, that is often sufficiently potent to determine a fatal issue from an ailment which, so far as the local or pathological conditions are concerned, would in a sane person most probably end in recovery. In scrofulous affections there was observed to be a peculiarly strong pre-disposition towards death. In diseases of the nervous system, 11 cases are entered as meningitis, because altered conditions of the membranes of the brain were the only well marked or extensive pathological changes perceptible by the naked eye. That altered conditions of nutrition existed in the minute structure of the brain, and that microscopical researches could demonstrate wide deviations from the natural arrange- ment or condition of the intricate cells or fibres of the nervous centres, is beyond all doubt. But then we have no names in our nomenclature for these microscopic appearances, and so it has appeared to me better to state, in the coarse language of our present system, merely what was apparent to unaided vision. In many of these cases the life of the patients simply ebbed away. They had once been raving maniacs and then had become poor demented creatures, whose intellects gradually faded till they were little else than tottering helpless animals, whose lives were kept agoing by food; that they had neither the sense to take, nor the appetite to desire. Death was but one of the phenomena to be expected in the course of a disease which during life we call dementia, and after death, meningitis. It would be perhaps more rational to say that death resulted from exhaustion, or syncope and coma combined, as it certainly did; but in saying so we have said very little more than that the patient died because he could not live, and at most we should attempt to state the mode of dying rather than the cause of death. In time, no doubt, we shall be able to describe the causes of the death of lunatics with greater precision; meanwhile, there is much to be learnt from the present arrangement or classification of diseases. Every case was actually dissected, and therefore the disease, whatever it may have been, that could be detected by the scalpel, has been placed under its own proper heading or sub-division. Grouped under headings which refer to the several physiological systems, the diseases are well placed for an analytical examination of their primary causes. The case returned as intermittent fever occurred before I came to the
DACCA ASYLUM. 17 asylum. Cholera is endemic in Dacca, but it was generally prevalent in the beginning of the year and again during the cold months. Six fatal cases occurred out of 13 lunatics who were attacked by the disease. Of the 41 deaths, 10, or nearly one-fourth, died from tubercu- lar disease; 14, or more than one-fourth, from diseases of the brain and its membranes; 3 from pneumonia ; 4 from dysentery; 6 from cholera; 1 from fever ; 1 from abscess; and 1 from violence inflicted by another lunatic. Looking to the months in which the deaths occurred, it appears that 10, or nearly a fourth of all the deaths, occurred in November, and 9 in Decem- ber. Many feeble lunatics suffering from organic diseases died with the commencement of the cold weather. The mortality is now (January) decreasing, and mainly, I think, because those amongst the lunatics who were most weak and sickly have already died. In November two cases of pneumonia died, and several others were admitted into hospital. The three cases of dysentery that I saw were all old cases, in which the tissues of the large intestine had undergone extensive morbid changes. The case of the man who died from rupture of the viscera was at the time of its occurrence reported to the Government. The circumstances of the case were as follows:18 DACCA ASYLUM. When the minimum monthly mean temperature fell to 66°, as it did in November, the death-rate ran up to 4 per cent. of the daily average strength of the month. The new wards which have been erected are so thoroughly perflated by the air, that they are very cold at night. I think that stoves with flues so carefully protected that the lunatics could not reach them, should be introduced and used for heating the air of the wards at night during the months of November, December, and January. The stoves and flues might be tried as an experiment, in the first instance, in the new ward, where they could be put up without much difficulty or expense. The overcrowding of the asylum has throughout the year been excessive. As is explained in the table, the lunatics have been made to sleep in the verandahs as well as in the wards. We had jhamps and screens put up in the verandahs, but we could by no means afford proper accommodation for the large number of lunatics in the asylum. I expected a much higher death-rate than we have had, and I trust that the medical department will strongly impress upon the Government that lunatics are more likely than even prisoners in jails to suffer from overcrowding; and that whereas the wards of the Dacca Jail afford to each prisoner at the present time a superficial area of 40 feet, the wards of the lunatic asylum can give to each of its unfortunate inmates no more than 28.92 square feet of superficial area and 451.93 cubic feet of space. The new female ward was commenced to be built in January last; by the end of the year the building was almost completed. In this incomplete state it has been left; the workmen have been taken off, and I can only regret that the Department of Public Works extended over twelve months building operations which I cannot but think might, so far as the work of building is concerned, have easily been completed in six or eight months. New wards are very urgently required for the asylum, and I trust that orders may be issued not only for their erection, but for their completion without unnecessary delay. VIII. Table No. 9 shows the annual expenditure of the asylum. The average yearly expense of dieting each lunatic has fallen from Rs. 48-3-11.3 of 1868 to Rs. 47-6-11.8, showing a diminution of annas 13-0.4 per lunatic in favor of 1869. This decrease is attributable to the cheaper rates at which provisions have been purchased. IX. Table No. 11 shows the estimated value of lunatic labor for which no cash pay- ment is actually received, but which is quoted either at one-half or one-third of the rates allowed by the Department of Public Works and of the bazaar. X. Table No. 12 is the annual return of sick. The daily average number of sick per cent. to strength for the twelve months was 9.61. XI. Table No. 13 shows the amount of profit derived from manufactures. The amount realized was Rs. 1,368-12-10, which, as compared with Rs. 586-6-11 of last year, shows an increase of Rs. 782-5-11 in the profits from manufactures during 1869. In Government resolution dated Fort William, the 6th July 1869, it was remarked that the outturn from manufactures of this asylum is not so good as it ought to be ; and the superintendent was directed to place himself in communication with Dr. Payne, and see if some useful hints could not be derived from Dullunda in this respect. I took charge of the asylum on the 23rd February 1869, and found that Dr. Wise had devoted the time and labor of his lunatics chiefly to the endeavour to clear the new ground which had recently been enclosed and dismantled of the house which had covered it. Foundations of the walls of houses had to be dug up, no less than 103 wells to be filled in, and a tank extending over about 5,372 square feet of superficial area, and reaching to a depth of 38 feet, had to be filled up. With the time and attention both of the establishment and of the lunatics thus devoted to the very desirable object of clearing and levelling the ground and preparing it for cultivation,
DACCA ASYLUM. 19 works of manufacture could not be carried on extensively in the asylum. On my arrival there was much work remaining to be done in the grounds of the asylum before a garden could be laid out. The filling up of the tank was completed, many large hollows in which water lodged were filled up, and the general surface of the ground was levelled. But for this, as for the labor of last year, we have comparatively a small sum in money to show. The advantages, however, which have accrued to the asylum are great, though not represented by a money value. In the month of August I had to go on duty to Calcutta, and I took advantage of the opportunity to place myself, as directed by the Government, in communica- tion with Dr. Payne, who most kindly showed me over the Dullunda Asylum, and gave me much valuable instruction and many useful hints. Amongst these probably the most important was the necessity of a good establishment. The shortcomings of the establishment of the Dacca Lunatic Asylum were last year commented on by Dr. Wise, and as the Govern- ment have refered me to the Dullunda Asylum, I trust that they will now sanction for the Dacca Asylum an establishment similar to that of Dullunda. We have purchased an English oil press, and we hope soon to be turning out regularly such quantities of castor-oil as will ensure for the asylum a steady source of profit. Some other hints in minor details have been gleaned, but I venture to think that it will take many years before the Dacca Lunatic Asylum, which is as yet only in a transitional state, can be made to yield anything like the outturn of an asylum that has been so long in development, and which is now in such admirable order, as the Dullunda Asylum. XII. Table 15 is an annual return of criminal lunatics, of whom there were in all 59, or 18.91 per cent. of the total number of inmates, in the asylum during the year. XIII. Rs. 181-10-9 have been received from the Maharajah of Cooch Behar for the payment in full of the cost of the maintenance of four lunatics; a further sum of Rs. 177-8-4 has been received for the maintenance of other patients. The total of sums received has been credited to the Government in the monthly bill for December. XIV. Conduct of the establishment.20 DACCA ASYLUM. XVI. The asylum has been regularly visited by the visitors, and frequently inspected by the Deputy Inspector-General of Hospitals, Dr. Buckle, C.B. It has also been inspected by the Inspector-General of Jails, Lower Provinces, and by the Sanitary Commissioner for Bengal, by both of whom minutes expressive of their opinions on the condition of the asylum were written, and I believe forwarded for the information of His Honor the Lieutenant- Governor of Bengal. XVII. Thus frequently inspected and reported on as the asylum has this year been His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal will have been well informed concerning the general management of the institution. I am happy to be able to add that having now got through much of the heavy work which had to be done in clearing away the debris of houses, and in bringing the new grounds of the institution under cultivation, there is reason to believe that the outturn from manufactures at this asylum will during the year 1870 be more satisfactory. Already the garden is yielding a considerable monthly income ; various branches of industry are being developed in the work-sheds; the preparation on a large scale of castor- oil is being commenced; and yet further resources in industrial labor will be developed as the idiosyncracies of the inmates of the institution are more intimately understood. I have the honor to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, H. C. CUTCLIFFE, F.R.C.S., Offg. Civil Surgeon, and Superintendent, Lunatic Asylum, Dacca. THE Deputy Inspector-General of Hospitals, MR. H. B. BUCKLE, C.B., in trans- mitting this report, makes the following remarks :DACCA ASYLUM. 21 preparing it for cultivation, which will, although no money return was credited to the institution, prove of great advantage from surrounding the asylum with a cleared open piece of ground of considerable extent. 5. The management of the asylum is most satisfactory : the insanes are kindly and judiciously treated ; they are encouraged to work, which is not made a task, but done with a willing and cheerful spirit. All their material comforts are sedulously attended to. Mr. Blackwell, the overseer, has a most kindly and pleasant manner with the insanes, and is evidently regarded by them with confidence. The superintendent reports very favorably of his attention to his duties, his gentleness and tact. The native doctor, Sheikh Kurreem Bux, is also favorably mentioned. From repeated visits to the asylum, the undersigned has had opportunities to acquaint himself thoroughly with the working of the institution, and concurs thoroughly with the opinions expressed by the superintendent, and also with the remarks of the visitors, respecting the excellent management of the institution, and the improvements that are being carried out.

PATNA ASYLUM. 33 FROM SURGEON J. BEDFORD ALLEN, Superintendent, Patna Lunatic Asylum, To THE DEPY. INSPR.-GENL. OF HOSPITALS, DINAPORE CIRCLE. Dated Patna, 1st January 1870. SIR, I HAVE the honor to submit the several returns of the Patna Lunatic Asylum together with my report for the past year. I took charge of the asylum upon the 13th July 1869. The past year has not been a healthy one, though we have had no serious outbreak of any epidemic. The hot season was very trying, and the rains unusually heavy with severe inundations ; the rate of mortality consequently high. Statement No. 2 shews an increase in admissions, &c., of 14, and a decrease of 3 remain- ing at the end of the year. Statement No. 3 contains abstract from the annual return of patients, male and female, and nature of insanity, drawn out according to the new nomenclature of diseases. Statement No. 4.34 PATNA ASYLUM. Statement No. 12 shews the articles manufactured and amount realized and disbursed for the same. These four last returns are not as favorable as last year's, owing to the reprehensible conduct of overseer Manson, whose laxity and incapacity totally unfitted him for the post he held. There is but little to remark upon with regard to treatment. The. application of the cold douche has been followed by good results, and I have freely permitted amusements and recreations. I have frequently remarked that an accession of excitement occurs at the period of the new moon, but no tables have been kept this year. The food is unexceptionable in quality and sufficient in quantity. The atta is ground in the asylum by the female insanes, who also prepare soojee for sale. The monthly meeting of visitors has been most studiously attended, and the Inspector- General of Jails paid his annual inspection visit in March last. The dry-earth conservancy system has been strictly carried out. One large shed was added for the use of the males, which cost Rs. 858, the whole amount sanctioned by the Government of Bengal in letter No. 779, dated 22nd February 1869. A large tank, 150ft. x 100ft., was sanctioned by the visitors to be excavated at a cost of Rs. 1,641-6, and application was made through the magistrate to the commissioner for assistance from the relief works, and sanction obtained for half the amount, Rs. 820, and sub- sequently a further sum of Rs. 17-9-9 was granted. This tank was considered necessary in consequence of the wells failing to give the needful supply. The work has been satisfactorily performed, and the earth made use of to level the compound. A pucka ghât yet remains to be built. Bamboo machans were put up in the verandah for the insanes to sleep on, damp was so excessive in the cells of the male ward. Upon receiving charge of the asylum, an unfavorable report of overseer Manson was given me by my predecessor, and the overseer's subsequent conduct proved him to be totally unfit and incompetent for such a charge. For two months after my taking charge he was con- fined to the house and incapacitated for work by severe illness. Shortly after returning to duty he was charged with committing a criminal assault upon a female insane, which charge though not proven, strong reasons existed for condemning his conduct, and his removal was ordered. Pending arrival of his successor he was retained, but behaving in a disgraceful and insubor- dinate manner, his immediate dismissal became necessary. A native overseer was appointed pro tem. I regret to say the whole of the subordinate establishment connected with the asylum became disorganized in consequence of the conduct of overseer Manson. The native doctor proved himself untrustworthy and was transferred. I may truly say I have had nothing but difficulties and up-hill work since I took charge of the asylum, but am glad to be able to add that I have every hope next year's report will be satisfactory. I have advised the appointment of a matron, and the Lieutenant-Governor has kindly taken it into consideration. I have the honor to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, J. BEDFORD ALLEN, Superintendent, Lunatic Asylum.
PATNA ASYLUM. 35 THE forwarding report of Deputy Inspector-Greneral H. M. MACPHERSON is appended :36 PATNA ASYLUM. after his arrival his fitness for his important office became suspected by Dr. Hutchinson, and his subsequent misconduct and necessary removal have already been fully reported. He quarrelled with the whole of the native establishment, who entertained no respect for him, and especially with the native doctor, who had up to that time been a useful and atten- tive man, but eventually became so insubordinate and insolent, that he had to be suspended and sent to a distant and inferior post as a punishment. The native doctor appointed in his room appears to give satisfaction, as does the native overseer or darogah who was put in subordinate charge of the asylum as a temporary measure until the arrival of a European overseer transferred from Cuttack. I trust that things will work well and smoothly under the superintendence of the latter, and it is proposed to place his wife in charge of the female ward should she prove to be qualified for the post.

MACDONALD, Superintendent of Lunatic Asylum, To THE SECY., INSPR.-GENL. OF HOSPITALS, INDIAN MEDL. DEPT., CALCUTTA. Cuttack, the 12th January 1870. SIR, I HAVE the honor to forward herewith the annual returns of the Cuttack Lunatic Asylum for the information of His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal. 2. On the 31st December 1868, 36 patients remained under treatment, viz., 29 males and 7 females. 16 have been admitted for the first time during the year 1869, 14 males and 2 females ; and 5 males have been re-admitted. Total treated during the year, 57. 4 have been discharged cured, 3 improved and taken charge of by their friends, transferred to other asylums 1, died 2 males and 1 female ; total remaining on 1st January 1870, 4642 CUTTACK ASYLUM. Post-mortem examination.CUTTACK ASYLUM. 43 in the average cost of each lunatic in these two asylums is caused by very nearly the same establishment being required for an asylum containing a daily average of only 36.26 lunatics as for one with more than four times that number. 10. The profits from labor, as will be seen by table No. 11, amount to Rs. 1,135-8-9, being an increase of Rs. 150-13-2 above that of last year. 11. A new building for European patients has been completed since my last report ; but as it has not been required for lunatics, it has been occupied by the European overseer. He has now been removed ; it is therefore available should it be required. 12. The wards are kept clean, are frequently fumigated, and there are earthen beds for the patients to sleep on in nearly all of them. Dry-earth system of conservancy is strictly attended to. 13. The establishment for the past year has consisted of superintendent, European overseer, head-keeper, native doctor, compounder, seven under-keepers, one chuprasee, one cook, one bheestee, one mehter, and one mehteranee, the annual cost of which, as has been already stated, has been Rs. 3,743-6-11, and the total cost of the asylum for the year has amounted to Rs. 5,079. Mr. Nowlan, the European overseer, has now ceased to draw pay from this asylum. This will reduce the cost of establishment for next year by Rs. 1,200. I have the honor to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, J. MACDONALD, Superintendent of Lunatic Asylum. MR. G. SAUNDERS, the Deputy Inspector-General of Hospitals of the circle, inspected the asylum early in January 1870, and reports :44 CUTTACK ASYLUM. healthy position at Chowliagunge. One other course may be adopted : put an upper-story to the present asylum buildings, and you at once double the accommodation at the small cost of about Rs. 10,000. Of course it is admitted that the grounds of the present asylum are too small, and too near to a crowded town ; but the best solution of the difficulty would, in my opinion, be to locate the insanes in the cavalry barrack at Chowliagunge. There were 37 insanes in the asylum on the day of my inspection; these I examined carefully and found to be in excellent physical health. No signs of scurvy here, for the men are fed sufficiently, and not overworked. The scale of diet adopted is that in use at the jail, with such additions as the state of health of the individual would seem to require. The asylum buildings are nice, neatly-constructed places, affording a proportion of separate cell accommo- dation, and the remainder divided into wards. The cooking arrange ments, conservancy, water supply, and general sanitation, are good, and so are all the measures adopted by the superin- tendent for the medical care of the insanes. Everything which fell under my observation met with my approval, except that, perhaps, more may be done hereafter in the way of occupationCUTTACK ASYLUM. 45 I am an advocate for loom work and other occupations involving no manual labor in our asylums, instead of the more laborious occupations above alluded to. Let the profit arising on these manufactures be credited to the fund, and assist in the support of the institu- tion ; but I do not think it is desirable to employ our insanes on work that must be a call, and a potent one, too, on the reproductive powers of the system. The lunatics were all well clad in this asylum, and very clean-looking. G. SAUNDERS, Deputy Inspector-General. No. 2. Abstract of the annual returns. SEXES. Remained on 1st January 1869.

There is no occupation for such an official here, and I recommend his discharge. A head native overseer, who was sufficiently educated to relieve the civil surgeon from the trouble of writing the monthly returns, and who could keep the accounts and supply diets, is all that is required in such a place as this; and I therefore advise the introduction here of a good darogah on Rs. 25 a month. I again invite attention to the recommendations which I made in my inspection reports on asylums last year; and when this asylum is re-built, or when new asylums elsewhere are constructed, I urgently press for the appoint- ment of a resident medical officer, as in all the asylums in England. There should be a good, specially instructed medical officer living on the asylum grounds. In every case his salary would be Rs. 100 a month only, and he would have under his superintendence every- thing connected with the sanitation, hygiene, treatment, and clothing of the insanes, whilst the civil surgeon, on a reduced salary, should be simple superintendent, which he is not now. I would give him Rs. 100 for this duty, instead of Rs. 150 and 200. The cost would be the same to Government, and increased efficiency would result. There were four criminal lunatics here, and I ordered the civil surgeon to see that in future the recent orders of the Bengal Govern- ment for the quarterly examination and report of insanes may be carried out. These buildings had very recently been repaired by the Department Public Works at a reasonable cost, I presume, and yet the whole of the enclosed space was in a state of disrepair which was exceedingly painful and annoying to witness, the plaster on the walls and pillars peeling off. The personal appearance of the inmates exhibited indications of anything but interest and care. G. SAUNDERS, Deputy Inspector- General. No. 2.

54 BHOWANIPORE ASYLUM. No. 54. FROM THE SUPERINTENDENT OF ASYLUMS AT THE PRESIDENCY, To THE DEPY. INSPR.-GENL. OF HOSPITALS, PRESIDENCY CIRCLE. FORT WILLIAM, Bhowanipore, the 6th February 1870. SIR, I HAVE the honor of submitting, for the information of the Inspector-General of Hospitals and Government, the annual returns of the Bhowanipore Lunatic Asylum, and of offering the following remarks on the facts they record. Admissions.BHOWANIPORE ASYLUM. 55 should be allowed to proceed to Madras, where he had been promised employment, and whither he considered himself bound when he was ordered to the asylum. Cures and transfers.56 BHOWANIPORE ASYLUM. for their maintenance. In this manner payments have been realized which could not other- wise have been enforced. The total expenditure of the year, including passage-money and sea-outfits, was Rs. 47,581, against Rs. 56,170 in 1868; of which Rs. 10,875 were incurred for passages and sea-outfits, Rs. 24,335 were expended on establishment (including salary of superintendent), against Rs. 21,306: the difference is due to sanctioned increase of wages and to enhanced numbers. The cost of actual maintenance per man per month was Rs. 23-5-4, against Rs. 29 in 1868, without deduction for sums received in payment for individuals. I can add nothing to what has been said in former years of the characters and conduct of the European subordinates. The head overseer and matron are so thoroughly suited in every respect to their situations, that all the daily routine of discipline and order is carried on almost without my intervention. Except where there are acute cases and others requiring medical treatment, my daily visit becomes little more than a visit of inspection, and for the management of correspondence and other external business of the institution. Overseer Franklin continues to deserve most favorable mention. During the year the health of the head overseer rendered it desirable that he should take privilege leave, and advantage was taken of the time when the asylum had fewest inmates. This threw additional work on the matron and second overseer, whose conduct left nothing to desire. I have the honor to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, ARTHUR PAYNE, M.D., Surgeon-Major, Superintendent of Asylums at the Presidency, Annual inspection report of the asylum by Deputy Inspector-General of Hospitals, G. Saunders. AT Bhowanipore there has been everywhere the same regularity and order observable as was noticed by me in my inspection remarks last year. Surgeon-Major Payne is an excellent superintendent, and bestows such an amount of care and attention on every detail connected with the management of this institution, that it would be scarcely possible to find fault with anything that has come under my notice during the year. The most scrupu- lous cleanliness is observable in every part of the premises, and I have never yet, at any one of my visits, observed the wards or rooms in which the insanes are confined otherwise than perfectly clean and neat. The conservancy also must be very perfect, for anything approaching a disagreeable smell is never, as far as I am aware, to be detected in any part of the asylum premises. That portion of the asylum allotted to the female insanes is a marvel of studied neatness and regularity. The wards are some of them wanting repair, and the centre building in the asylum grounds (in which the overseer resides) is in an unsafe condition, and should be repaired at once. It was in contemplation to pull down some of these asylum buildings and reconstruct on a better plan, and with a view to the acquisition of greater space and accommodation; but I am of opinion that with substantial repairs to the superintendent's house, and annual petty repairs to the other buildings, additional accommodation is not now needed, if, as contem- plated and recommended by Dr. Payne and myself, the majority of soldier insanes are sent from the provinces to the most ready port for embarkation, Bombay. As a rule, I think the provisioning at this asylum has been as good as can be expected. Occasionally the con- tractor has had his meat condemned, and I had occasion only recently to make a remark in the visitors' book which was adverse to the meat supplier; but I quite think that the inmates are well fed, and well clothed also.
BHOWANIPORE ASYLUM. 57 A very pretty and useful garden shed has been erected during the past year in the asylum grounds of corrugated iron. It is for the use of the female insanes, to enable them to sit out as much as possible in the open air. It is covered now with creepers, and is not only useful, but ornamental. The superintendent's report will give all necessary information of a statistical nature, as also on the question of cost of maintaining the asylum; but I may remark that the cost of actual monthly maintenance per individual (Rs. 23-5-4) is moderate and reasonable, considering the manner in which the supplies are contracted for and the higher market rates of many articles of food during the year. The medical treatment of the insanes has always appeared to me to be judicious. It is very rare indeed that much treatment is needed, and the overseer and his assistant are generally enabled, I am told, to carry out their orders without having recourse to violent measures of repression. Occasionally forcible restraint is needed, but usually kindness and gentleness are all that is required. In his report, the superintendent raises the question of the causation of insanity as dependant on, or associated with intemperance, and records his belief that in most cases where an insane has been addicted to intemperate habits, it should be considered as one of the manifestations of disease. Possibly Dr. Payne is correct in his view of the relationship between insanity and habitual drunkenness, but probably the true explanation is this, that whereas in rare cases it is found that mania directly results from intemperance, yet that the too free use of spirituous liquors will be more likely than anything else to assist in maturing mental disease whenever there is a hereditary tendency, or the individual is predisposed by habit or mode of life, or as a result of acute brain disease. Very little is done at this asylum in the way of labor. Doubtless many forms of mental disease are benefitted by manual labor, and it is to be regretted that such an approved remedial agent cannot be more frequently had recourse to; but it seems there is considerable difficulty in this asylum of carrying out any system of labor. Soldier insanes are only here for a short time, and Dr. Payne finds that the Eurasians won't work. The women do needle work, and croquet and other amusements are available for the latter. I think it is to be regretted that the after history of the insanes sent from this asylum to England is never communicated to the superintendent, and this remark is especially refer- able to military insanes. Insanity is often assumed by men in the service as a means of getting themselves dis- charged, and I think I have occasionally seen men at Bhowanipore whose appearance and condition suggested the idea either that the particular mental condition for which they had been invalided was of a very ephemeral kind, or that it had not existed. A brief sketch from England of the insanes' after history might be a useful aid and guide for the future. G. SAUNDERS, Deputy Inspector-General. P

Dacca. Patna. Cuttack. Moydapore. 1. The total number of insanes admitted and re-admitted into the several native institutions* during the year was slightly below the number in the previous year, being 418 against 429; but the aggregate number treated was greater than in any of the preceding six years, namely, 1,106. Of these 237 were discharged, 16 per cent. as cured, and 5.3 per cent. improved and made over to friends, the total percentage being 21.4 against 25.71 discharged in 1868. The re-admissions were 27, or 3 per cent. less than in the previous year. 2. The mortality amounted to 113, or 10.2 percent. of the total number treated, which was slightly in excess of the rates in 1868, though below the average of the preceding six years; while the percentage of deaths to the daily average strength stood at 15.6 against 15.25 in 1868, when the results were considered particularly favorable. Of the 113 deaths, 18, or 16 per cent. were from cholera. At Cuttack and Moydapore the daily average strength was too small for purposes of general comparison. At Patna, where 269 were treated, the results, both as to cures and mortality, were more favorable than at either Dullunda or Dacca ; while at Dullunda, which received the largest number, the results were more favorable than at Dacca, where decidedly the greatest amount of sickness prevailed. 3. The relative proportions of females to males, 1 to 4.35, and of the several classes of Hindoos, Mahomedans, and Christians, exhibited no remarkable variation. Seventy-one criminal lunatics were admitted, of whom 9 were received a second time. It would be of importance, with reference to the deputy inspector-general's remarks in his annual inspection report as to the frequency of crimes committed during temporary insanity induced by the use of intoxicating drugs, to note how far such cause has operated in these cases, and special observations should therefore be made and reported in future returns with respect to this class. 4. Of the whole number under treatment, 71.15 per cent were suffer- ing from acute or chronic mania, as distinguished from dementia, and no less than 490 cases proceeded from, or were attributed to, the use of intoxicating drugs and spirits. The number in Patna from ganjah alone, put down at 126, is very noticeable, and would show that this drug is more largely consumed in Behar than elsewhere. At Dacca it would appear that distinction between the cases arising from the two classes of stimulants was not very carefully made, and the remark of the medical officer that ganjah- smokers are all spirit-drinkers is certainly opposed to general experience.
( 2 ) Only 4.7 per cent were traced to moral causes, while in so large a proportion as 592 cases, or 46 per cent, the causes were wholly unknown. 5. The total cost of maintenance in the five institutions during the year amounted to Rs. 66,464, or Rs. 92-2-6 per head. This amount is reduced to Rs. 43-11-0 by deducting the estimated earnings of each lunatic, taken at Rs. 48-7-6, a very gratifying result, not only in a pecuniary sense, but as an indication of the extent of attention paid to exercise and discipline as means of recovery. The cost of diet is still very much greater at Dullunda and Dacca than at the other institutions. 6. Dullunda.( 3 ) misconduct of the late overseer who has been discharged.

No. 353. FROM THE INSPECTOR-GENERAL OF HOSPITALS, INDIAN MEDICAL DEPARTMENT, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL. Dated Fort William, the 13th July 1871. SIR, I HAVE the honor to present the reports and returns of the lunatic asylums of the Lower Provinces for the year 1870. To these I shall, in accordance with former practice, prefix a general statement, illustrated by summary tables, commenting on the general results of the year as compared with the series and average of the five years preceding. 2. Statement No. 1 furnishes the summary results of 1870 for all the native asylums in comparison with the years 1865-69, and statement No. 2 shows the general statistical data for each institution for the year under review. It were well if each asylum gave the figures of the year under report in comparison with former years on a uniform plan, so that it might admit of ready comparison with its own previous history, with other asylums, and with the general table for all asylums. For this purpose a form will be adapted and brought into general use. No. 1. Comparison of 1870 with the five preceding years. 1865. 1866. 1867. 1868. 1869. Average of 5 years. 1870. Increase.

4 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. No. 3.LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 5 The proportion that criminal lunatics bear to the whole number confined in asylums is 20.62 per cent., while in England the proportion is about 1.3 per cent. It is interesting and important to contrast the statistical results of the asylums of this province with the county and borough asylums of England. I shall take for this purpose the report of the commissioners in lunacy for the year 1868, the latest which I have received. As regards population, these English asylums exhibit a much higher residual population than the Bengal asylums, and a much more rapid growth. Thus, the increase in the six years 1864-69, taking the 1st of January census in each, was 25 per cent. as regards the pauper residents, while the corresponding increase in the Bengal asylums for the six years 1865-70 was 15.6 per cent. In England, in five years, 1864-68, the daily average strength for the same class of asylums was, to total admissions, as 1 to 1.5: in India, in five years, 1865-69, the same proportion was 1 to 3. In 1868 each lunatic in county and borough asylums spent 287.34 days in the asylums; in Bengal, in 1870, the corresponding number spent 246.34. These figures plainly prove the position above laid down, and must be borne in mind in considering comparatively all the statistics of the year. 5. Admissions.6 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. The proportion of the relations of the sexes in the present year wasLUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 7 The greatest number of admissions, both of males and females, takes place between twenty and thirty years ; this is equally true of the five years 1865-69. The other decades shown, follow in this order:8 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. varying number of deaths from cholera. Excluding this disturbing element, the diminution and serial diminution is equally apparent. The increase of population, less prone to die, is, as Dr. Payne points out, undoubtedly one cause of this; and the bar placed in 1868 on the importation of weakly lunatics from a distance may account for it in part. It is difficult, therefore, to estimate how much of the result is due to these circumstances, and how much to improved sanitary conditions of residence, better care, and more successful treatment. One set of data which might help in determining this question is wantingLUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 9 No. 6.

The reason of this is, that many of the deaths in English asylums come out of the residuum of former years12 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. The greatest number due to any one cause is entered under debility. This term expresses the same truth which in former returns appeared under the terms asthenia, cachexia, anæmia, exhaustion, &c., namely the dissolution caused in brain disease by simple impairment of the vital energies and wasting of the organism. Its central feature is innutrition; tissue waste is not supplied, and from the absence of palpable brain lesion sufficient to account for death, no more specific account of it can be given; but there are important varieties of this wasting and exhaustion. There are the wasting and exhaustion of acute brain disease, of paralysis, and of chronic brain disease. The first it may be possible to control; the last two are not amenable to remedy. Food is, in these conditions, of minor value. In acute insanity, if the brain disorder can be by time, or artfully applied calmatives, restored to order, nutrition is re-established; but in cases of the latter sort, though aliment is often largely and eagerly consumed, it avails not to build up the frame or restore the vital force. This class of causes will always rank high in statements of asylum mortality, and is one of the best exponents of the dependence of the proper nutrition of the body on the soundness of that central organ which co-ordinates all its actions. The depraved nutrition is in many cases associated with dropsy, local or general, and this may be thrown into the same category of causes. Taking them all togetherLUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 13 and (2) how much of the fatal disease was directly dependent on the insanity, intimately associated with it, modified by it, or apparently unconnected with it; but data are wanting, and could only be obtained by an elaborate and careful study of each case. Dr. Saunders makes a suggestion which will in future be adopted14 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 13. Causes of Insanity.LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 15 Superintendent of the Dacca Asylum remarks on the greater suitability of out-door labour for lunatics, and in this he is supported by the experiences of asylum management in Europe. Amusements, which constitute so notable a feature in the moral treatment of lunatics in Europe and America, are not so readily available in this country. Nautches were at one time employed as a means of amusing patients in the Dacca and Patna asylums, but the reports of 1870 are silent on the subject. Mechanical restraint is employed to a greater extent in the treatment of patients in this country than in Europe, but in a very mild and modified form, and generally with some specific purpose16 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. The results are very similar to those of 1869. The average total cost per man per year is a trifle above that of 1869 ; the average sum gained by lunatic labour is about Rs. 2 less. The estimate of labour is, however, a loose quantity, and it is probable that a sane agency would do more work for the money. There is a very slight increase in cost of establishment, a decrease in dieting, and a slight increase in clothing. Owing to the increased number of lunatics, there is an increase of Rs. 5,500-3-10 in the aggregate cost of asylums, and an increase of Rs. 9,110-4-1 in the net cost, taking into account only money actually realized, or profits and sums paid by friends of patients for maintenance. 17.

The report submitted by Mr. Cutcliffe is highly interesting, and betokens an appreciation of the duties devolving upon him and the requirements of the asylum, as well as a perseverance and energy in performing the one and endeavouring to meet the other, which are warmly commented on by the administrative officer of the circle. It is satisfactory also to note that the overseer, Mr. Blackwell, has performed his duties so commendably. Patna.20 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. Dr. Saunders writes approvingly of a proposal to bring the asylum into cantonments and locate it in the European hospital. The conduct of the native overseer is favorably reported on, and the proposal to increase his salary by yearly additions of Rs. 5, supported by the Deputy Inspector-General of Hospitals. This would encourage him to continued attention to his duties. Bhowanipore.FROM SURGEON-MAJOR ARTHUR PAYNE, M.D., Superintendent, Dullunda Lunatic Asylum, To THE DEPUTY INSPECTOR-GENERAL OF HOSPITALS, PRESIDENCY CIRCLE. Calcutta, Dullunda, 1st February 1871. SIR, I HAVE the honor of submitting, for the information of the Inspector-General of Hospitals and of Government, the usual statements showing the working of the Dullunda asylum during the year 1870, and of offering some observations on the facts they exhibit as a report on the proceedings of the year. 2. Population.22 DULLUNDA ASYLUM. 5.

The men who have made the death-rate what it has been, have never approached the garden or the work-sheds. They have come to the place in extremity of weakness; they have lost all muscle for work and all stomach for digestion; and nourishment and industry have been alike impossible to them. If indeed I could have added to the number of the employed, I should have lessened the deaths from nervous exhaustion. There is a kind of labour which is very deadly. The wild efforts of a maniac struggling with attendants are exhausting beyond description, and life is always in jeopardy while they last. When the lunatic can be subjected to the example of others' industry, and the orderly exercise of his muscle can be substituted for delirious throes and spasms, his risk of exhaustion becomes infinitely less. This is but one of the many uses of industry into which it is not necessary to enter more particularly now. 12. For the first time during an incumbency of ten years I am compelled to report a death from violence. A maniac was brutally ill-treated by a peon, and died from the effects of it. The peon was convicted and imprisoned, and thus was obtained the only possible satisfaction which can follow the occurrence of such a case. The crime occurred in one of the few parts of the premises which are hidden from the overseer's windows, and formed a very strong reason for what I have been for years endeavouring gradually to effect in the complete exposure of every corner of the place to his unsuspected view. The death by drowning admits of no explanation. The man went to bathe as usual with a party; he was a swimmer and dived off the steps as he was accustomed to do. Presently he was missed, and search was made for him without success. A lunatic who stood by him when he dived, pointed out the spot and said that he had not seen him come to the surface; but being busy in the water himself, had paid no further attention to his neighbour. He dived in presence of the overseer who brought up the body. The water was shallow, but there was no sign of bruise or injury; no entanglement of the body at the bottom, nor any apparent cause for what occurred. The case was duly reported to the magistrate for judicial inquiry. Cases of drowning similarly inexplicable occur from time to time among healthy persons, and ignorance of the cause has led to the use of an indefinite term in recording them, viz. " swimmer's cramp." 13. Cases of Insanity.DULLUNDA ASYLUM. 25 take their meals. Formerly the verandahs and wards were used; this was, for many reasons, objectionable. The first improvement was the distribution of food in a part of the work-sheds cleaned daily for the purpose. As work increased, space here became scarce, and the people were fed in the open air. The ground, however, could not be kept clean; and the swarms of flies which collected on the food, and were often swallowed with it, made the inspection of meals a nauseating task. There is now completed a large, substantial, and handsome building, devoted solely to the preparation and issue of food. The cook-room and bakery occupy one end of it. They are thus removed, with all their inconvenient belongings, from the dwelling- houses of the lunatics; and the issue of food taking place under the same roof, there is no need of carrying it about or uselessly exposing it. Ultimately the whole interior will be protected from flies and other vermin by complete walls of perforated zinc. This material, and its iron frame-work, are expensive. Hitherto the cook-room and bakery only have been provided with it. It so fully answers its purpose that I cannot doubt that the money is well spent, although perhaps to any one who had not watched the people at their meals, such a provision as this might seem fanciful. The money value of the building estimated, as in the department of public works, in its present state, is Rs. 4,168. Other smaller buildings for various purposes, and a moderate estimate for improving the large tank, raise the total value of unpaid lunatic labour to the sum given in tables 10 and 11. 17. General treatment and management.26 DULLUNDA ASYLUM. The native doctor's conduct and qualifications have been made the subject of a special report which is now before Government. His removal has been directed, but is delayed pending the orders of Government on the general question of appointing the departmental native doctors to special and peculiar work of this kind. The conduct of the native establish- ment has been good, except in the instance of the peon who is now in prison.

CUTCLIFFE, F.R.C.S., Officiating Civil Surgeon, Dacca, and Superintendent, Lunatic Asylum, Dacca, To H. B. BUCKLE, ESQ., C.B., Officiating Deputy Inspector-General of Hospitals, Dacca Circle. Dated Dacca, the 28th January 1871. SIR, I HAVE the honor to submit, for transmission through the ordinary channels to the Government of Bengal, this my annual report on the lunatic asylum at Dacca for the year 1870. 2. Population.DACCA ASYLUM. 35 bring about the collection of large numbers of cases which are but little amenable to treat- ment must be sought for from without36 DACCA ASYLUM. with the customs and habits of the people from whom our lunatics are derived, assures me that what I stated was correct. With a view to afford what information I can on this point, I have had table No. 10 prepared. It is a nominal return of lunatics whose lunacy has been attributed either to gunja or spirit. The right-hand column has been filled up by the overseer from the information which in course of confidential conversation the lunatics have given him. In table No. 4 the classification has been made with reference to that which seemed in each case to be the major exciting cause. 5. The castes and sexes of patients admitted during the year are shown in table No. 5; 62.33 per cent. of the patients were Hindoos, and 37.66 were Mahomedans. Of all admitted, 77.91 per cent. were males, and 22.07 were females. 6. The trades and occupations of the patients admitted during the year are shown in table No. 6; 33.77 per cent. were from the agricultural classes, 51.95 per cent. were servants, and 14.28 per cent. were professional beggars. 7. The ages of the patients are shown in table No. 7. Between 20 and 30, and between 30 and 40 years of age, there was an equal number of patients, each decennial period contri- buting 35.06 per cent. to the total number of admissions. From 40 to 50 years of age, the number of patients amounted to 19.48 per cent. of all admissions. 8. The causes of mortality are shown in table No. 10. Table No. 11 has been prepared to show the total number of deaths from cholera and from other causes, and the ratio per cent. of deaths calculated both in proportion to the total population (as has hitherto been the custom in this asylum), and also to the daily average strength, which is the more usual and correct method. The ratio per cent. of deaths to daily average strength was, during the year 1870, 18.46, or .72 more than the death-rate of 1869, and 4.10 less than that of 1868, in which year, however, 7.5 per cent. of the deaths were caused by cholera, which disease in 1869 destroyed only 2.38 per cent., and in 1870, 2.24 per cent. of all who died. But in 1869 one accidental death (from injury) occurred, and in 1870 two accidental deaths (suicides) occurred. Excluding these accidental deaths as well as the deaths from cholera, the death-rate from other diseases has been, for 1868, 15; for 1869, 14.68; and for 1870, 15.78 per cent. to daily average strength. In table No. 12 are exhibited the causes of death, ratio per cent. of deaths in each month, the temperature, and the accommodation afforded. Of the 41 deaths, it appears that 8, or 19.51 per cent., are returned as cases of "meningitis." They were cases in which well-marked and extensive morbid changes were observable in the pia mater and arachnoid. Most of those cases seemed to sink from exhaustion. But I have classified all cases as much as possible in accordance with the chief pathological lesions observed on actual dissection of the body. In the three cases of dementia with debility, the arachnoid and pia mater were not in such states as would be at all described by the word " inflamed," and the causes of death in these cases have been referred to debility. The same remarks apply to those cases entered as epilepsy with debility. 14.85 deaths, or 24.41 per cent., resulted from diseases referable to the brain and its membranes. Five deaths, or 2.24 of the total number of deaths, resulted from cholera. The total number of cases of cholera treated in the asylum during the year was 13. The ratio per cent. of deaths to cases treated was therefore 38.46. No case of cholera occurred in the asylum after the month of May. Indeed, it is very remarkable that no case of cholera is known to have occurred in Dacca from August to the end of the year. The absence of the disease from the asylum during these months is therefore not attributable to any specialities connected with the institution and its inmates, but is merely in harmony with a very exceptional absence of the disease from the town. Why cholera did not appear in Dacca, as it almost always does soon after the rains have ceased, I am unable to explain. Another exceptional peculiarity of the year was the prolonged and high inun- dation of the country; but whether there may have been any possible connection between
DACCA ASYLUM. 37 these peculiarities, I am unable to say. Six out of 50 cases of dysentery admitted into hospital, or 12 per cent., died. This disease is extremely fatal amongst natives in Dacca. Dr. Wise found from the returns of the Mitford hospital, from the year 1854 to the year 1868 inclusive, that of 868 admissions into that hospital from dysentery and diarrh38 DACCA ASYLUM. a cloth passed round the neck and tied to the iron door of his cell so as partially to support his body. The deceased was last seen alive at 2 A.M., when he was visited in his solitary cell by the jemadar on duty. At 4 A.M. he was visited by another jemadar and found to be dead. The death was immediately reported to the overseer, who visited the cell at 4-30 A.M. At 6-30 A.M., on arrival of the superintendent at the asylum, the case was reported to the magistrate, who immediately instituted a magisterial examination on the spot. The post-mortem evidence went to show that the man died from hanging. The following is a copy of the magistrate's remarks:DACCA ASYLUM. 39 12. Profits.40 DACCA ASYLUM. The keepers of the asylum are not at all what they ought to be; the pay is insufficient to attract good men; and it seems to me unreasonable to suppose that in Dacca any native who has no more than Rs. 5 per mensem can be trusted to feed and nurse lunatics. If the keepers got nothing more from the asylum than their Rs. 5 per mensem, I do not under- stand why they serve, since it is clear that they can readily get higher wages for less work out of the asylum. The large number of annual escapes from the asylum further indicates a want of carefulness and attention on the part of the keepers. 16. Management.DACCA ASYLUM. 41 its grounds. The present hospital is exceedingly defective, though capable, at a small outlay, of being converted into what would be suitable for the purposes required. My views have been laid before the Department of Public Works, and I am given to understand that the subject has been taken up by them. I would urge that this work should be ordered to be done at once. A system of drainage for the whole asylum was arranged after the levels have been taken, and the main drain has now been commenced. I wish I could add that it was rapidly progressing towards completion. In September last, at a monthly meeting of the visitors, I reported that the two criminals who escaped last month (August) from the asylum made their escape from the hospital, and I pointed out that the portion of the containing wall of the asylum grounds adjacent to the hospital is for 62 yards only 6½ feet high. The visitors were of opinion that this portion of the wall should be raised to a height uniform with the rest of the containing wall. The visitors further thought that it would add to the security of the inmates, and be a considerable improvement to the asylum grounds, if gates with a porter's lodge were erected at the outer end of the road now leading up from the chowk to the overseer's house. If this were done, the asylum wall bordering this piece of road might be pulled down, and space and free circulation of air be thereby gained. I beg now to press this opinion of the visitors on the consideration of the Government. The asylum has now a separate department for females, but it wants a matron to look after them. It is, I hope, unnecessary to do more than to mention the fact that there is no matron for the female depart- ment. This department can be unfortunately overlooked by the male prisoners from a part of one of the wards of the jail. I have brought this to the notice of the Department of Public Works, and I trust that orders will be issued immediately to adopt measures to prevent this very objectionable overlooking of the female lunatics by the prisoners in the jail. 18.

No. 17. FROM B. SIMPSON, M.D., Superintendent, Lunatic Asylum, Patna, To THE DEPUTY INSPECTOR-GENEEAL OF HOSPITALS, DINAPORE CIRCLE. Patna, dated 11th February 1871. SIR, I HAVE the honor to forward the annual report of the Patna Lunatic Asylum for the year ending 31st December 1870, for the information of the Inspector-General and Government. Population.56 PATNA ASYLUM. The only remaining death resulted from suicide under the following circumstances:PATNA ASYLUM. 57 were raised 4 feet, and railing introduced between the outside pillars, to prevent the men at work being interfered with by lunatics outside. The whole of the above repairs were executed out of the profits of manufacture, and at a cost of about Rs. 200. The dismantling of the roof was rendered necessary by the great leakage during the rains, owing to the low pitch of the roof, and also because the walls were found to be cracking. It is my intention during the present season to erect a new shed for the manufacture of castor oil for the use of the asylum, as well as for sale, as soon as there are sufficient bricks ready for the purpose. I also propose erecting two English looms, for the manufacture of table covers, as some of the patients have become skilled in the art of weaving. Most of the criminal lunatics are employed in weaving cloth, tape, table-covers, blankets, and in spinning putooa, and have lately turned out some excellent work. The ordinary lunatics make mustard oil, bricks, soorkey, and are also employed in gardening, road-making, tailoring, &c. At the north-east corner of the compound there is a tank which was dug during the famine of 1869 by order of the commissioner at a cost of Rs. 837-9-9, in order to give employment to the poor. In the warm weather, however, last year it was found to dry up, and was a great nuisance, inasmuch as it was constantly resorted to by the patients as a privy. Mr. Nowlan, the new overseer, on his arrival, set about remedying this at once by deepening and enlarging this tank so as to ensure a constant supply of water. The excavated earth was used to raise the general level of the garden. The females are generally employed in making atta for the use of the inmates of the asylum, in spinning cotton and wool for manufactures; they also pound soorkey and prepare the whole of the vegetables for cooking. From the 1st April Mrs. Nowlan was appointed matron on Rs. 25 a month, and on my taking charge I received from my predecessor, Dr. Duka, a most satisfactory account both of her and her husband, Mr. Nowlan, the overseer, who was some time in Dullunda asylum for instruction in his duties, and subsequently at Cuttack, previous to his being sent here. He takes a great interest in his work, and has done much for the asylum since his arrival, in the way of reform. It is now conducted on the same scale as the institution at Dullunda. I have the honor to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, B. SIMPSON, M.D., A.M., Superintendent, Lunatic Asylum. No. 2. Abstract of the Annual Return. SEXES. Remained on the 1st January 1870.

STEWART, ESQ., Superintendent, Lunatic Asylum, Cuttack, To THE DEPUTY INSPECTOR-GENERAL OF HOSPITALS, PRESIDENCY CIRCLE, CALCUTTA. Cuttack, the 25th January 1871. SIR, I HAVE the honor to forward herewith the annual returns of the Cuttack Lunatic Asylum for the year 1870. 2. During the year there were 20 admissions and 2 re-admissions, 46 remained at the close of last year, so that the total under treatment was 68. Of these, 17 were discharged cured, 5 improved and made over to friends, 9 transferred at the beginning of the year to Dullunda Asylum, 2 died and 35 remain under treatment. 3. Of the two deaths, the first was from diarrhCUTTACK ASYLUM. 65 7. The situation of the asylum is unfortunate, being in the centre of the town, and with insufficient enclosure for the recreation and diversion of the patients. The wards, however, are very well built, and provide sufficient and good accommodation for the inmates. At the beginning of the year eight lunatics were transferred to Dullunda. This has been the means of preventing overcrowding; the transfer was occasioned also by the want of separate room for the reception of dangerous insanes. 8. The rule in the asylum is to let each man move about the grounds as freely as possible; encouragement is given to employment, but no force whatever is used. The chief amusement of the weak and recovering is to move about the garden grounds, weeding or watering it. It is found very difficult to keep the noisy and turbulent from harassing those who are better disposed; hence, for want of special accommodation for this class, they are from time to time transferred to Dullunda. 9. The chief occupation of the lunatics disposed and able to work is weaving, spinning twine and thread, tailoring, cooking and occasional soorkee pounding. The actual sale proceeds of manufactured goods are Rs. 220-6-1; the estimated cost of labor during the year is Rs. 593-15-3. This is calculated by fixing a rate on the kind of work engaged in; but as task work is never exacted, the outturn is very much less to what would be the case if the lunatics were pressed to work. 10. The average annual cost of each patient for establishment is Rs. 83-6-0; for diets, Rs. 26-14-2; bazar medicines, As. 3-6; contingencies, Rs. 3-6-10; clothing, Rs. 2-9-2; making the total cost of each, excluding income and estimated profit of labor, Rs. 116-8-0. This large amount is mainly due to establishment, which is very nearly the same as required for a large asylum, where among a larger number of patients the average cost appears much less. The average expense of diet of each inmate during the year is less by Rs. 4-10-4 to what it was in 1869. 11. Cleanliness and perfect conservancy of the asylum are strictly maintained. Dry earth conservancy is carried out, and disinfectants, such as sulphate of iron and burning sulphur, used in cells which become soiled by weakly patients. 12. The asylum was inspected by the Deputy Inspector-General of Hospitals on the 10th September, and again on the 15th. On the former date the commission appointed to inquire into the advisability of releasing two criminal lunatics was convened. These men, Soobur Naik and Uchub Naik, were in the asylum for six and three years respectively, and were charged with committing murder and causing grievous hurt, but were acquitted on the ground of insanity. In the inquiry it was elicited that both these men indulged in the use of gunja previous to committing the offence, a habit which doubtless had some connection with the origin and development of their mental aberration. Both men were pronounced as being perfectly sane and fit for discharge; the proviso, however, was added, that except they refrained from indulgence in gunja or other intoxicating agent, they were liable to a return of the dangerous excitement which led to their admission into the asylum. They were discharged from the asylum on the 18th October, and made over to the care of their friends by the Superintendent, Tributary Mehals. 13.

JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT. MEDICAL. Fort William, the 30th October 1871. READ A letter, No. 475, dated the 15th August 1871, submitting the reports and returns of the lunatic asylums in the Lower Provinces for the year 1870. 1. The Lieutenant-Governor perceives that the statements have been differently arranged from the last report, and that some new tables have been added, rendering the whole more comprehensive. His Honor quite agrees with the Inspector-General's remarks as to the necessity for uniformity of plan in the returns of the several institutions and in those of the general report, and hopes to see an improvement in this respect caused by the forms which the Inspector-General proposes to adopt, unnecessary diffuseness and repetition of details being avoided as much as possible. The nominal lists and particulars of individual cases, which of course must be carefully recorded in the departmental registers, need not appear in the printed report. 2. The number of insanes remaining in the five native asylums on the 1st of January 1870 was 746, and 401 were admitted during the year, making a total number of 1,147 persons treated, which is in excess of the average of the preceding five years by 119, but only 41 more than the total of the previous year. The actual admissions were less by 17, and the re-admissions again were more numerous( 2 ) 6. The health of the inmates appears to have been on the whole better, and there were fewer deaths (10 only) from cholera. The mortality bore the proportion of 9.3 per cent. to the total number, showing a decrease of 1.9 per cent. below the average of the previous five years. This is a very favorable result as compared with the other provinces in the statement given in paragraph 9 of the report, Nagpore only excepted. 7. There is scarcely any variation to notice in the classes of persons admitted, of whom 74.06 per cent. were Hindoos, 24.18 Mahomedans, and 1.74 Christians. The proportion of females admitted was greater by 5 per cent. than in the previous year, the admissions being 306 males to 95 females. 8. Of the various types of insanity, 773 were cases of mania, 285 of dementia, and 89 were minor forms. Of these, 36 per cent. are classified as acute, and the remaining majority as chronic. The number of cures, amounting to 35.2 per cent., belonging to the latter class, is, as pointed out by the Inspector-General, a satisfactory proof of successful management. 9. As usual, a very large proportion of cases in which the causes are known proceed from intoxicating agents, and especially from the deleterious effects of ganjah, of which 316 instances out of 466 cases have been recorded. As regards criminal lunatics, the inquiry, which was ordered last year, has resulted in 12 out of 80 known cases being attributed to the use of ganjah. 10. The aggregate expenditure during the year, according to statement No. 10, has been Rs. 71,965-3-7, each inmate costing on an average Rs. 92-15-4, which is slightly in excess of the average cost of the previous year. The total amount estimated as profits from manufactures and value of labour is Rs. 34,686-7-7, the average earning of each lunatic employed being computed at Rs. 52-6-6; but as these earnings form a separate fund at the disposal of the Superintendent, and do not, so far as the Lieutenant- Governor understands, contribute to the reduction of the general expenses they should not appear in this return, and the form should be altered by the omission of columns 4, 5, and 8, which are at present only calculated to mislead. The Lieutenant-Governor would be glad to know if any portion of these funds are credited to general revenues or are in any way expended on the maintenance of the lunatics. Apparently the only amounts which should be deducted, and which are now omitted, are the payments made by friends for the maintenance of patients. These should be credited to the general account and be remitted in full to the treasury, as directed in the resolution of last year. 11. The sum of Rs. 1,349-5-3 realized from the friends of patients, of which Rs. 973-9-3 only was paid into the treasury, is considerably less than the amount recovered in the previous year. It is observed also that such payments were realized solely at the Dullunda Asylum, with the excep- tion of Rs. 20 only at Patna. A report should be made how they are regulated, and whether some uniform system of contribution cannot be adopted in all the asylums, according to the circumstances of the parties. 12. Dullunda.( 3 ) reference to the remarks on this subject in the 2nd paragraph of Dr. Payne's report, it should be pointed out that the law requires a specific certificate from the visitors that in their opinion the lunatic can be discharged without danger of injury to himself or others, and that when this certificate is given the Government discharges him. But visitors are naturally reluctant to give this certificate, and consequently criminal lunatics increase in number. This may render the management of an asylum more difficult, but it is a less evil than discharging persons whose homicidal mania may at any time recur. 13. The progressive improvement in the mortality rates since 1856 is highly creditable to the management of this institution, and the number of cures and transfers is also satisfactory. The Lieutenant-Governor is well assured that in the efforts of the Superintendent to improve the asylum industry, the essential object, viz. the cure of those committed to his Charge, will not cease to be carefully regarded. 14. It would appear that here, as well as in the other asylums, no system of check prevails over the account of the receipts and expenditure of the Industrial Funds. The Lieutenant-Governor considers also that credit is wrongly taken, as profit, for articles in store, and that nothing but actual cash received by the sale of manufactures and produce should be expended under this head. These accounts should be regularly submitted for audit to the Inspector-General of Hospitails. 15. The Lieutenant-Governor has noticed with pleasure the commend- ation bestowed on the overseer Mr. Bancroft and the matron. 16. Dacca.( 4 ) amounting to 32.35 per cent. of the number treated, and the mortality had diminished to 2.9 per cent. These results are very satisfactory, and evince careful management on the part of the Superintendent and his subordinates. 21. Moydapore.ANNUAL REPORT ON THE INSANE ASYLUMS IN BENGAL FOR THE YEAR 1871. BY J. CAMPBELL BROWN, ESQ., C.B., Inspector-General of Hospitals, Indian medical Department. Calcutta: PRINTED AT THE BENGAL SECRETARIAT PRESS. 1872.
ANNUAL REPORT ON THE INSANE ASYLUMS IN BENGAL FOR THE YEAR 1871. BY J. CAMPBELL BROWN, ESQ., C.B., Inspector-General of Hospitals, Indian Medical Department. Calcutta: PRINTED AT THE BENGAL SECRETARIAT PRESS. 1872.
No. 346. FROM J. CAMPBELL BROWN, ESQ., C.B., Inspector-General of Hospitals, Indian Medical Department, To THE OFFG. SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL. Dated Fort William, the 27th June 1872. SIR, I HAVE the honor to submit the reports and returns of the lunatic asylums of Bengal for the year 1871. Revision of forms of returns. 2. In accordance with several suggestions which I found it necessary to make in my last report, regarding the improvement of the forms of statistical returns submitted by the officers in charge of lunatic asylums, I caused the forms hitherto in use to be very carefully revised, with a view to rendering them more complete and comprehensive. After consulting Drs. Payne and Wise as to their fitness, the revised forms were issued for future adoption in the form of a circular, which I place as an appendix to this report, and the statistics of 1871 have been drawn up in accordance with this scheme. The preparation of some of these forms has caused a little trouble and led to some delay, but they will be better under- stood in future and prepared more easily and promptly. The same scheme of returns has been adopted in all the other asylums of this presidency, and is now under the consideration of the Government of India in the Home Department, with a view to its adoption in all the lunatic asylums of India. These forms meet all the imperfections and omissions which I pointed out in last year's report; they certainly appear to be numerous and elaborate, but it is most desirable to register fully and accurately all the circumstances connected with so very important and interesting a subject as lunacy, and the difficulty and labour involved in their preparation is due more to the calculations necessary for the purpose of comparing one institution with another, and the year under report with its predecessors, than to any complexity in the facts which are noted in each table. The written reports of Superintendents show that the preparation of, and comment upon, these tables cause them to institute a most searching study of the events of the year, and the sequel of this report will demonstrate that under the system now initiated data of great interest will be systematically noted. In accord- ance with the alterations in the returns of each institution, it has become necessary to alter the general statements which have been employed to illustrate this general report. These changes have been made as slight as possible, and the general tables of this year will bear a comparison with those of previous reports, their order and form being preserved as nearly as possible the same. I have not considered it necessary to append to the report of each asylum the whole series of forms prescribed by the circular, and have omitted those whose contents are exhibited in the summary tables illustrating this report, supplying a reference to these, and giving in extenso those only whose facts are not exhibited in the general report. Summary of the statistics of all asylums. 3. Statement No. 1 exhibits the principal events of 1871 in each asylum, and a sum- mary of these for all the asylums of the province, the statistics of the sexes being shown separately. It corresponds with tabular form No. 1 of the circular, in which the events of the year under report are placed in series with those of former years : table No. 2 of the circular furnishing a reduction of these to certain arithmetical ratios for the sake of com- parison. These tables have been printed this year, but it will not be necessary to reproduce similar tables every year, and the abstracts attached to the remarks on each asylum give the main facts of former years in relation to the strength of the inmates, and exhibit a comparison, sufficiently detailed for practical purposes, between different institutions and different years. Table No. 3 of the circular, which notes the same events monthly, is also annexed to each report.

4 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. Statistics of crimi- nal lunatics. 5. In Statement No. 3 the statistics of criminal lunatics are given for each asylum and a summary of the whole. In the corresponding table for 1870 the statistics of the five years 1865LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 5 would therefore be lost, and matters would remain very much where they were. The subject was under discussion at the close of the year. Dr. Payne has again represented in his report for 1871 the difficulties connected with this class of lunatics, and similar difficulties have been experienced in the other asylums of the province, which moreover are becoming overcrowded from the accumulation of criminal insanes. It is hoped that a final solution of the difficulty will be achieved before the close of the present year. The population of asylums a grow- ing one. 7. Population.6 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. Admissions from different districts. Relative propor- tions of the sexes. Table No. 5 appended to the report of each asylum shows the districts from which the lunatics admitted and re-admitted into each asylum were brought, and the relative proportion of the castes and sexes, and may be read in conjunction with this statement, which shows the caste and sex of the admissions into each institution. Females constituted 21.50 per cent. of the admissions of 1871, against 23.6 of 1870 and 20.8 of the five years preced- ing. Hindoo females again constitute a larger proportion of Hindoo admissions than Mahomedan, the numbers being respectively 23.76 and 13.97. In England the female population of asylums generally exceeds the male ; in Bengal, females constitute 22 per cent. of the number living. No conclusion can be drawn from these figures regarding the com- parative prevalence of insanity among males and females. It is interesting to note that females contribute 26 per cent. to the number treated in-door in the hospitals and dispensaries of Bengal, excluding the Calcutta institutions, where a definite amount of space is assigned to female patients. The presumption is, that whatever the relative amount of the male and female population of Bengal, or the relative number of lunatics among males and females, the people are more loth to send females to asylums, and contrive to manage them at home.

LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 13 Inferences from the statement ; As regards popu- lation ; From this it appears that, comparing periods of one month, the numbers living decrease regularly; comparing quarterly periods, the same circumstance is observable. In annual periods a similar reduction of strength among older residents is obvious, and this becomes still more apparent as longer periods are taken. The asylums are thus ever being emptied, and the large majority of their residents are comparatively short-term residents. The Dacca asylum shows a larger proportional number of long-term residents than the two others, and a comparatively smaller number of short-term. This is quite in keeping with the smaller admission rates of 1870 and 1871, and the longer average term of residence of each lunatic. As regards events. When the events of the year are classified on the same principle and reduced to per- centages of the number living under each class, most interesting features appear. Both the recovery and death-rates of earlier and shorter periods are larger than those of later and longer periods. The small numbers in many cases give results which the larger figures of many institutions or several years would correct, but the general truth is plainly evident, more particularly when the ratios of the first and second year are compared. It will be observed that while the recoveries of Dullunda and Dacca show nearly the same relations to numbers living during the first year, the deaths in the latter asylum in the earlier times of residence are much more numerous in relation to number living; though the deaths of later terms14 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL.

The subject was referred to the special committee assembled in connection with the Dullunda Asylum, whose proceedings and the orders passed thereon will be referred to in my next report Contribution to the maintenance of patients. 28. A report was at the same time called for as to whether some uniform system of contribution to the maintenance of patients could not be levied according to the circum- stances of their friends. In my letter No. 1226, dated 1st March 1872, I discussed this subject fully, and recorded my opinion that section 15 of Act XXXVI of 1858 placed sufficient power in the hands of Magistrates to investigate the circumstances of parties and enforce payment of maintenance in part or in whole, if he found them competent. The reports of superintendents showed that this section had been administered loosely, and I urged that neither visitors nor superintendents were empowered under the law to demand payment for public patients. No orders have been received on the subject of this correspondence. Forms of accounts. Difficulty of esti- mating value of lunatic labor. 29. The accounts of the several asylums are given according to the forms hitherto in use. The value of stock in store has been eliminated, as directed in paragraph 14 of the Resolution of 30th October 1871, and only money actually received entered. It is difficult to exhibit accurately the profit, if any, obtained from industrial pursuits, because the debits, which are shown against the receipts, are not the only items which render the industrial products possible, and strictly speaking, the value of the labor of the agents, or the cost of their food and lodging, should be shown against the receipts. Summary of finances of the year. Receipts from pay- ing patients. Industrial profits omitted. Why. 30. The following abstract gives the main financial facts of the year. Column 2 gives the total expenditure, and column 4 the cost per man of the average strength ; the average cost is Rs. 90-9-5, against Rs. 92-15-4. The sums actually paid into the treasury on account of paying patients are given in column 3, and column 4 shows that the average cost of each patient is diminished by about Rs. 5 through these payments. The sum realized for maintenance during 1871 was less than in the two previous years, but higher than in the three years preceding. The de- crease is due to smaller receipts at the Dullunda Asylum. The columns showing the credits of the industrial fund have not been inserted because they are not, except in the case of Dullunda, which shows net receipts, clear profits. This could not be the case unless all the debits were included in column 2, which is not done. If Government received all the credits and sustained all the debits, then the sums realized for the products of industry would be a clear gain.

Reputed or sus- pected lunatics may be lodged in asylums, pending disposal. 32. On a reference from the Magistrate of Dacca it was decided (Bengal Government letter No. 3830, dated 12th August 1871,) that accused persons detained under observation to ascertain whether they are sane or not, and accused persons who have been found inca- pable of making their defence under section 390 of the Criminal Procedure Code and detained pending a reference to Government, may be lodged in a Lunatic Asylum at stations where there is such an institution. Superintendent cannot perform function of medi- cal visitor. 33. A question was also submitted from Dacca regarding the inconvenience occasionally experienced in the absence of a medical visitor in having the bills of the Asylum passed and discharging non-criminal lunatics. It was suggested that the Superintendent should, in the absence of a medical visitor, perform the duties of one. It was ruled (Bengal Government letter No. 1969, dated 24th June 1871,) that bills should be submitted to, and audited by, the Deputy Inspector-General of Hospitals, and that such other duties as could not be transacted by post should stand over until this officer could conveniently visit the Asylum.

Dr. Wise's remarks regarding the causes why re-admissions are apparently fewer, escapes apparently more numerous, and sickness apparently greater, are worthy of notice. The practice of performing a port mortem examination in every fatal case is a most excel- lent one, and more necessary in an asylum than in any other institution. I quite coincide with his remarks on the comparison of English and Indian asylum statistics, but making due allowances for differences, the comparison is still interesting and useful. The Gheel system proposed. 43. Dr. Wise advocates the Gheel system of boarding out lunatics. I recommend that he may be permitted to make an experiment under the conditions that,24 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 2 Female attendants @ Rs. 6 per mensem. 3 Ditto @ Rs. 5 ditto. On the urgent representation of the Superintendent, the pay of female attendants has been recently raised, and the establishment fixed as per margin Bengal Government letter No. 779, dated 24th February 1872). It is hoped that the Overseer's house will be included within the asylum compound ere long. Inspection. 49. Deputy Inspector-General of Hospitals C. R. Francis, M.B., who is a visitor of the asylum, remarks in his inspection report that there has been a tendency to overcrowding during the year, and that this has necessitated the discharge of as many lunatics as the visitors could possibly send away. The main block of buildings is said to be low and damp, and Dr. Francis can suggest no remedy short of pulling it down and reconstructing it. This, he remarks, must be done sooner or later.

By following every patient's history during the year in the diary I could complete the table, but this would be extremely tedious, and as this infor- mation seems to me less essential than that which belongs to the mental health of the inmates, I have selected the table as one to be omitted on the present occasion. Full parti- culars of fatal cases will be given, and I need scarcely say that a record has been com- menced, which will serve henceforth for the preparation of the 14th table. Unusual preva- lence of phthisis. It is worthy of remark that pulmonary phthisis has been unusually prevalent this year. In connection with the very crowded state of the asylum, the fact is interesting ; but as this state has already been fully represented in special reports, and the question of increased accom- modation has the anxious attention of Government, it seems needless to discuss the subject further here. Cures. Escapes. 5. Cures numbered 104, against 89 in 1870. In this number the escapes have hitherto been included, for the escaped lunatics, who are not soon brought back, are for the most part persons no longer insane, who are awaiting their formal discharge, or those whose insanity has been doubtful from the beginning. They will be separately recorded in future. Transfers. 6. Transfers.DULLUNDA LUNATIC ASYLUM. 29 Government. They afford, however, accommodation enough, if it be, as I hope it may be, determined to confine the population of the asylum within much narrower limits. Some works of construction which were required have been effected from the industrial funds without cost to Government. Their value, as estimated by the Public Works Depart- ment, is Rs. 2,500-8-0.

DiarrhREPORT ON THE DACCA LUNATIC ASYLUM. BY SURGEON JAMES WISE, M.D., SUPERINTENDENT. THE new forms of annual returns were only received on the 18th ultimo, which accounts for the unusual delay in forwarding these papers. Comparison of 1871 with previ- ous years. Cause of decrease of re-admissions. 2. Table 1 is an abstract of the annual return of 1871 and of the ten previous years. The details from 1861 to 1865 are not reliable, and cannot therefore be compared with those of subsequent years. The admissions during the past year have been below the average, but the total number is one more than in 1870. In the column of re-admissions there is a striking difference between the first five years and the last six. Of 160 persons re-admitted, 113 fall within the former period, and only 47 in the latter. The frequency with which individuals addicted to ganjah sought re-admission after recovery was so obvious, that the Superin- tendents have of late years detained under more lengthened observation all habitual smokers of ganjah in the hope that a longer residence in the asylum would tend to make them break off their dissolute habits. I believe that the reduction in the re-admissions of late years is due to this practice. It is to this cause, and to the fact that prior to 1867 all escapes were returned as cures, that the smaller number of cures recorded of late years is undoubtedly to be referred. There is a discrepancy between the numbers remaining at the end of one year with those at the beginning of the next, but the figures have been carefully copied from the annual printed returns. Since 1866 the figures are perfectly correct. No separate registers of male and female inmates were kept until 1864. Ratios of events to population. Events reckoned on admissions. * Not printed ; see Statement No. 14. 3. Table No. 2* is the ratio per cent. of strength and treated of the events of 1871 and the ten preceding years. This table, like the previous one, is vitiated by the irregularities in the registers of former years. The figures of the last six years are accurate, and one year may be compared with any other. Taking the three first lines, the average admissions per cent. of total admissions for these six years was 40.05, of discharges and deaths 42.77, and of discharges 24.42. With these averages the events of 1871 are comparable. Cures. Deaths. In this table the most important columns are those showing the ratios of cures to total number treated, and of deaths to total admissions. Taking from 1866 to 1870, the ratios of cures averaged 12.39, while in 1871 it was only 10. The only explanation of the falling off are the circumstances referred to under table 1. Of the deaths to admissions, details will be given hereafter, but it is noteworthy here that, while from 1866REPORT ON THE DACCA LUNATIC ASYLUM. 35 Escapes. Escapes are included in the discharges. This year only 4 eluded the attempts made to recapture them. The wall surrounding the asylum is only 5½ feet high at one part, and it is at this place that the lunatics escape. In former years a much larger number absconded ; but when the wall was raised, a considerable reduction in the number of escapes occurred. When the wall is raised in the only place where it is still low, escapes ought rarely to happen. Deaths most nu- merous in the cold season. The deaths were very numerous at the beginning of the cold season. Of 42 deaths during the year, 22, or 52.5 per cent., happened in the three last months. The cause of this high rate of mortality will be considered when the causes of death are explained. Sickness. Cause of apparent excess. The daily average number of sick appears large, but of late years all weakly and demented lunatics, who require extra food and exceptional care, have been included in a " convalescent roll." They are placed under the close observation of the Native Doctor, who sees that they receive the diet especially ordered for them. Religion and residence of patients. Ganjah smoking a vice of Hindoos. Table No. 5 is a table of the religion and zillahs of patients admitted during 1871. Hindoos are admitted in considerable greater number than Mahomedans. Without a correct census of the proportion in which these two classes stand to one another in the zillahs of Eastern Bengal, it is impossible to draw any conclusion from this fact. There can be no doubt, however, that ganjah smoking, which sends so many mad men to the Bengal asylums, is peculiarly a Hindoo vice. Mahomedans prefer the more stupefying effects which follow opium-smoking or opium-eating. Proportion of males and females. Rarity of madness among Gipsy tribes. Of course few Mahomedan females, except criminals, are sent to asylums. A large proportion of the Hindoo females are " Boistubees." In that comprehensive class Mahomedan females also enroll themselves when they leave their homes. The proportion of males to females in the Dacca asylum has been for many years about 4 to 1. It is a curious fact that no record exists in this asylum of any member of the wandering Gipsy tribes, such as Koonch, Boideya, &c., being admitted into the asylum. This appears to support the generally received theory that the nearer we advance to savage life the less insanity do we find. Trades and occu- pation. Causation. * Vide General Statement No. 6. Table No. 6* is a return showing the trades or occupations of those admitted in 1871. Cultivators, as usual, furnish the largest number of lunatics ; then come persons employed in domestic service and beggars, which term includes fakirs and Bairagis. Ryots are not much given to ganjah smoking, or to the use of any intoxicating drugs. The cause of their insanity can often be referred to domestic troubles,36 REPORT ON THE Results according to duration of insanity. This table also shows that lunatics are cured and die in much larger proportion in the first year than in any other. * Vide General Statements Nos. 7 & 7a. Table No. 9* shows the events of 1871 according to duration of residence in asylums. Events according to duration of residence. The average residence of each inmate was 1,550 days, or over four years. This calcu- lation establishes the fact that a very large proportion of the inmates are hopeless cases, and that they may be considered permanent inmates. Cures. Of the cures, 21 out of 29 were discharged within a year of admission, and the average residence was only 481 days. Deaths. Of the deaths, 11 occurred within six months of admission, and 20 within a year. The average residence of all the fatal cases was 961 days. General health on admission and discharge. Table No. 10 shows the general health on admission and discharge of lunatics during 1871. Of the 63 males, 18 were admitted in good, 23 in indifferent, and 22 in bad health. Of the 17 females, 8 were in good, 1 in indifferent, and eight in bad health. Of the total admitted 10 were discharged and 5 transferred to friends. Out of these 15, 10 were in good, 2 in indifferent, and 3 in bad health. Deaths among ad- missions of the year. Of the total admitted within the year the death-rate was high, 15 out of 80, or 18.75 per cent. dying. Diseases causing mortality. DACCA LUNATIC ASYLUM. 37 Death-rate. Causes of excessive mortality. The mortality as calculated on the daily average strength was 19.71, or 1.29 per cent. more than in 1870, and 1.47 higher than the average of the last five years. In a special report, dated 27th December last, to your address, I dwelt on the causes of the excessive mortality during 1870. Not having been personally in charge, the proofs on which I based my arguments were collected from the records in the asylum. I attributed the mortality to four causes,38 REPORT ON THE Greater facilities of transit to Dul- 1undah. In the transmission of lunatics to the Dullunda Asylum I presume the railway is ordinarily made use of, and that only in rare instances are mad people exposed to such exciting causes of disease for such a length of time as those of Eastern Bengal are. On these points, however, the available information is meagre. Admissions from Assam more numerous. It may be suggested that this cannot be the real cause of the permanent high rate of mortality of this asylum, as lunatics have always been sent from Assam to the Dacca Asylum, and that they probably took as long ten years ago to reach their destination as now. This, however, I find was not the case. Between 1859 and 1865 the admissions from that division only amounted to 24, while from 1866 to 1871 they rose to 62. Increase of death- rate directly as the distance travelled. In the report forwarded to Government in December last, it was shown that the death- rate increased nearly in proportion to the distance come, and that lunatics sent from Assam died at the rate of 42.3 per cent. within a year of their arrival; from Tipperah at 25.7 per cent.; from Cachar at 22 per cent. ; from Cooch Behar at 20 per cent.; while from Dacca the proportion was only 11.05 per cent. Duration of resi- dence of fatal cases diminish- ing. That some such cause is contributing to the high mortality rate is strengthened by the following return of the average number of days passed in the asylum by each lunatic who died during the past five years. In 1867 the average period was 2,082 days. 1868 DACCA LUNATIC ASYLUM. 39 Rupture of the spleen. Causation. 2. Aziz Mahomed, aged 32, was admitted on the 28th March with acute mania of seven months' duration. His health was bad. He was suffering from fever and enlargement of the spleen. At 2 A.M. on the morning of the 10th April he was heard by the keeper moaning. The Native Doctor was summoned and stimulants were given. He died at 5 A.M. After death a ruptured spleen, weighing even then 2lb 3¼ oz. was found. Along the internal or concave surface, a tear of great length dividing several blood vessels was traced. As death was clearly owing to this rupture, the Magistrate was communicated with, and Mr. Rampini immediately attended and took the evidence of all the keepers who were on guard at the time. His deci- sion was as follows,40 REPORT ON THE this year. Both were inspired to proclaim a new religion, which was to embrace all races and creeds in one social brotherhood, while it left each individual to worship God according to his conscience. One was an inmate of the asylum. On finding Hindoos, Mahomedans, and Christians eating the same food on the same spot, he confessed that he had been anticipated, and that there was no further need for him to enlighten the world. Acute dementia. Acute dementia is exceedingly rare among natives. In the records of the asylum are the cases of two boys who became suddenly affected with dementia from fear; one in 1857, who was so terrified at the sound of the guns the day the sepoys mutinied at Dacca, that he became incurably insane. The second was aged about 10; he fancied he saw a bhoot or goblin one night and immediately became insane. The case returned under this head was a domestic who had smoked ganjah to such excess that reason disappeared and left him a mere animal in his habits. He, however, made a rapid and satisfactory recovery. Paralysis of the in- sane. Idiotcy. Paralysis of the insane is also very rare. This, one of the most frequent causes of death in European asylums, adds little to the mortality of Indian lunatics. Two deaths from partial softening of the brain occurred during 1871, but in neither case were the symptoms those present in paralysis. Of the four cases returned as idiotcy, one is a criminal; he is not an idiot however, but a deaf and dumb boy. He is dying of consumption. The second is nearly 35 years of age. The unintelligible sounds which he makes to express his wants are eagerly listened for by friends, as it is believed by the Mahomedans that they are divine or inspired utterances. The third is a good natured boy, aged 19, who makes himself generally useful, and who has acquired considerable amount of intelligence since he wandered into the asylum. Causation of in- sanity. * Vide General Statement No. 10. Table No. 13* shows the supposed causes of insanity among the total treated. Proportion of phy- sical and moral causes. Madness is much more frequently owing to physical than to moral causes. In 1871, of 290 cases treated, 152, or 52.4 per cent., had their insanity referred to physical, and only 28, or 9.64, to moral causes. As many as 110, or 37.9 per cent., had no cause assigned. These figures do not represent the exact proportion, but they approach correctness. Ganjah smoking. Under the head of ganjah the largest number are as usual included. The ratio this year is less than formerly. An endeavour has been made to distinguish between the occa- sional consumer and the habitual smoker. The former cannot properly be classified in the same list with the latter, yet in this asylum it has been the pratice to do so. The ganjah smoker who really appreciates its value, never becomes a spirit drinker. Spirituous liquors do not produce the sensual intoxication he desires, and the after effects are not pleasurable. Opium smoking; a Mahomedan vice. Opium smoking, introduced into this district by the Chinese about 40 years ago, has many votaries in Dacca. The vice is peculiarly a Mahomedan one, and I have never seen a Hindoo practising it. Habitual intemperance from opium is rarely followed by insanity. The intellect becomes deadened and blunted. The intoxication is more lasting than that following ganjah smoking, and the cost is much greater. There were only three inmates of the asylum during 1871 whose madness had been traced to this cause. Two came from Assam, and the third was a fakeer from Dacca. Suppression of opium smoking suggested. If the sale of " chundoo," i.e. opium prepared for smoking, could be prohibited by Government, much misery and poverty would be extirpated from Mahomedan cities. The vice is still young, and there are no Chinese in Eastern Bengal, as in Calcutta, to encourage its public sale and consumption. Epilepsy. Epilepsy is said to have been the exciting cause of insanity in five cases, all males. This number, or one in 58, is below the average of former years. The total number of epileptic patients in the asylum during the year was 11, namely, 7 males and 4 females.
DACCA LUNATIC ASYLUM. 41 Hereditary predis- position. Hereditary predisposition is said to have been the cause of insanity in 12 cases, 9 males and 3 females, or 1 in 24. The insanity was42 REPORT ON THE is a necessity, and for the asylum use eight cows have been purchased this year. The milk cost Government nothing, and the feed of the cows is defrayed from the manufacturing fund. Chest diseases. Pulmonary affections, excluding phthisis pulmonalis, have been less frequent than usual. Like dysentery, pneumonia is a very common sequel of other complaints. Along with fevers of the cold season it is especially liable to occur. Of the remaining diseases there is nothing deserving of mention. Confinement and restraint. * Omitted. Table No. 15.* There are no solitary cells in the usual acceptation of the term in the asylum, but there are cells for single patients. No lunatic is ever locked up for twenty-four hours consecutively. Patients in the acute stage of mania, and lunatics who have exhibited dangerous tendencies, are confined in these cells, but they are taken out morning and evening for exercise in charge of keepers. Their meals are also taken outside. Lunatics who are mischievous or quarrelsome, or who attempt to escape, are punished by being confined in one of these cells. Their tobacco is stopped while undergoing this punish- ment. No lunatic is ever confined without my order. No mechanical restraint is ever used, and I find by the records that the use of such coercive means was entirely abolished in 1853. Vaccination. DACCA LUNATIC ASYLUM. 43 been received from the families of lunatics sent from any of the zillahs of Eastern Bengal, with the exception of Dacca and Cooch Behar. This non-observance of the requirements of section 15 of Act XXVI of 1858 deserves the attention of judicial officers. It is not in the power of the Superintendent to prevent this, but Government should point out to Magistrates that by law the relatives of lunatics are bound to pay something toward their maintenance. Profit of lunatic labor. Table No. 19 is the estimated profit of lunatics for which no payment has been received. The daily pay of each man is calculated at half the bazaar rates. Table No. 20 is the statement of the actual net profit of lunatic labour in the asylum during the year. Items credited to Government. The sum of Rs. 1,266 was derived from the service of lunatics as dhobies, barbers, &c., and from works in the asylum executed for the Public Works Department by lunatic labour. I purpose in the ensuing year to credit Government with all reductions that can be made in the establishment by the employment of lunatics, merely showing in Table 19 the profit which may fairly be estimated as earned by lunatic labour. In the same way I propose to give vegetables from the garden without charging the contract rate to Government, as has been the practice for many years. This innovation will materially affect the amount derived from lunatic labour, but it appears to me that Government ought to be credited with any diminution in the cost of the asylum that is possible, while at the same time the actual profit of the manufactures carried on in the asylum should, as the Secretary of State directed, "be made available for extra comforts for the lunatics." Value of stock in store. In this table only the actual cash receipts of the year are shown. No valuation of the stock in hand and of produce still unsold on the 31st December is shown. From a careful inventory made in the beginning of January it was computed that property of the value of Rs. 1,337-5-0 belonging to the industrial fund was in stock in the godowns. This consisted of wood, mustard, and castor-oil, soorkey, &c., &c. Industrial fund. Table No. 21 shows the annual receipts and disbursements of the industrial fund for 1871. On the 1st January the fund had at credit in the bank Rs. 4,467-1-3; on the 31st December this had risen to Rs. 6,334- 9-6. Overseer I need not enter here into the causes of Mr. Blackwell's resignation, and of its acceptance by Government, as these were fully explained in my letter of the 8th ultimo. As Mr. Blackwell had ceased to interest himself in the asylum and its inmates, his loss will not be felt. The confidence which was placed in him was forfeited, and the manufactures of the asylum seriously declined owing to the insecurity of advancing money for the purchase of materials. Native Doctor. Pay insufficient. With the Native Doctor Prosonno Coomar Sein, I have been perfectly satisfied. He joined on the 12th April. His attention and kindness to the sick was during the year most praiseworthy. I only regret that with such onerous duties his pay is not larger. The Native Doctor at the Manickgunge sub-division, where there is a small dispensary, draws Rs. 40 per mensem for performing the lightest of duties; while the Native Doctor of the asylum with duties that oblige his attendance day and night, and with an average of 34 sick, draws only Rs. 25. Establishment. The establishment, as at present paid, is not trustworthy. The improved rates of pay will I trust receive the sanction of Government, and induce men of better physique and intelligence to take service in the asylum as keepers. Visitors. The asylum was visited on the 10th March by His Excellency Lord Napier of Magdala, who was pleased to record his satisfaction with the asylum and its appearance. On the 25th September His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal inspected the asylum, and was satisfied with everything he saw. The Deputy Inspector-General of Hospitals made several visits of inspection to the asylum in September, as also one in November. The records of these visits show that there was nothing that called forth any objections or suggestions of improvement in the manage- ment or sanitary arrangements of the institution.

AT the date of last report 35 lunatics remained under treatment, viz. 24 males and 11 females. During 1871, 32 males and 5 females were admitted, 1 male and 1 female re-admitted, total 39. The total treated during the year has been 74, of whom 11 have been cured, 3 improved and made over to friends, 1 reported sane (a criminal) and forwarded to stand his trial before the Assistant Commissioner of Sumbulpore, and 4 have died, viz. 3 males and 1 female. At the close of the year there remained 55 patients, viz. 41 males and 14 females. The number cured to total treated per cent. has been 14.8, and deaths to total treated 5 4 per cent. Criminals. 3. Of the lunatics in the asylum at the close of the year 12 were criminals, 7 of whom were admitted during 1871. They have been reported on quarterly to Government by the official visitors. Sickness. 4. Sickness.REPORT ON THE CUTTACK LUNATIC ASYLUM. 63 No hospital. Removal of crimi- nal lunatics re- commended. There is neither hospital nor dead-house attached to our asylum. If our criminal lunatics were transferred to Dullunda, or to some asylum expressly built for criminal lunatics, which I think would be a most desirable arrangement, it would relieve this asylum, for a time at least. Industry. Difficulty of find- ing profitable employment. 7. The labor has been of the usual kind, and the patients encouraged, but not bound to employ themselves. The work-shed is however very small, and the garden ground too limited to enable noisy patients to be kept at a sufficent distance from those disposed to be industrious. As the sale of articles here is very limited, it is difficult to find profitable employment for our men. By the sale of our lunatics' work Rs. 342-7-11 has been realized, and the value of work executed in the asylum, but not charged for, estimated at a very moderate rate, has been Rs. 349-2-6,64 REPORT ON THE No. 1.

REPORT ON THE BHOWANIPORE LUNATIC ASYLUM FOR THE YEAR 1871. BY SURGEON-MAJOR A. J. PAYNE, M.D., SUPERINTENDENT. Admissions. Transmission to Europe of insane soldiers. THE admissions, 65 in number against 53 in 1870, show a small increase, which seems to be only in course of ordinary fluctuation. The military admissions numbered 31 against 32 in the preceding year, from which it is clear that the proposed method of despatching soldiers to the Upper Provinces direct to Bombay with other invalids has not yet been adopted. The method of despatch by the several invalid ships of the season has been commenced, and has up to the present time worked without inconvenience. It is to be feared, however, that as insane soldiers continue to arrive from the provinces late in the season, and the military authorities at Bombay make very small allotments to the successive ships, some men will remain to be sent home by long sea voyage at a heavy cost with the civil lunatics of the year. This would be avoided if the men were sent direct to Bombay from their regiments, and as the vessels sail once at least in each month, there need be no accumulation in the Bombay asylum. Causation. Causation is, as usual, very unsatisfactorily noted among the admissions. Antecedent information is commonly difficult to procure. Intemperance is an assigned cause in 9 cases, but with one or two exceptions I doubt whether it can be regarded as in any sense a true cause in this number. Hereditary transmission has been affirmed in 1 case only. There have been 6 cases of epilepsy, all males. Cranial injury is held accountable for 1, sunstroke for 2, excessive study for 2, domestic trouble for 1, and childbirth and fever each for one only. Types of mental disease.

THE Inspector General of Hospitals observes that some diversity exists in the forms of Statistical Returns of Lunatic Asylums. As it is essential, for purposes of comparison and compilation, that these forms shall be uniform, the following illustrations of those which should be invariably appended to the Annual Report have been prepared. Forms of Registers are also laid down, on which it is believed that the facts required for the preparation of the returns may be conveniently noted. While the forms of returns now prescribed should be accurately adopted, it is not intended to prevent Superintendents from preparing and adopting other and additional forms of returns which they may wish to exhibit for the purpose of proving or illustrating particular points. The data necessary for preparing all these Statements for 1871 may not be available ; but as many as can be compiled from recorded facts should be given; and when any form is submitted blank, a note should be made of the cause. The Registers and Forms now required are as follows:84 APPENDIX. No. 3. Register of Admissions into Hospital. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Number on General Re- gister. Name. Disease. DATE OF REMARKS. Admission.

The "average number living" may be obtained by taking a daily account or census of the number living under each class, adding at the end of the year and dividing by 365. The total of all the classes (columns 5, 9, 12, 17, 21, and 25, excluded,) should be equal to the daily average number resident during the year. The same result may be obtained by finding the number of days each person on the year's register (among the total treated) spent in each class during the year. Thus A admitted 1st January 1871, and discharged 31st December 1871, gives 31 days to column 2, 28 days to column 3, 31 to column 4, 90 to column 5, 30 to column 6, 31 to column 7, 30 to column 8, 91 to column 9, 92 to column 10, 91 to column 11, and 365 to column 12. B admitted 1st January 1870, and remaining 31st December 1871, gives 365 days to column 13. C admitted 1st July 1869, and remaining on 31st December 1871, gives 181 days to column 13, and 184 to column 14. D admitted 1st January 1865, and discharged 30th June 1871, gives 181 days to column 18, and so on. The number of days noted in each column should be totalled, and divided by 365. The result would be the average number living in each class for the year. The latter method will probably be found the easier. Results capable of comparison with other Asylums will thus be obtained; but unless the number living at each period of Asylum age noted, is given, the results of any one institution will not admit of comparison with those of any other. Average term of residence is obtained by adding together the total residence of each person, and dividing by the total treated, cured, improved and died. No. 10.

Statement showing the particulars of Solitary Confinement and Mechanical Restraint in the(RESOLUTION.) JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT. MEDICAL. Calcutta, the 4th October 1872. READ( 2 ) many cases recurrent insanity only indicates repeated intoxication; and Dr. Wise attributes a diminution in the number of re-admissions in Dacca to the plan of keeping ganja-smokers and other such insanes longer under observation with the view of divorcing them more thoroughly from their vicious habits. Many of the re-admissions are said to be merely the re-entry of criminals discharged for trial, and others the return of lunatics, whom their friends find it impossible after experiment to manage. The number of re-admissions of criminals who had only been discharged for trial should always be noted. 5. The Hindoos, as in former years, give by far the greatest number of admissions( 3 ) are altogether wanting. In England almost all lunatics are under treatment. In Bengal there seems reason to believe that the great majority never reach the asylums. Then, again, nothing is known of the previous history of most cases in India. The cases sent in by the police are generally those found wandering about homeless, whose insanity is chronic. We might, indeed, fairly expect a far heavier mortality in our Indian asylums than we now have. The rate was slightly higher among males than among females. One-half of the total deaths were among patients of less than a year's residence. The Inspector-General has analysed very carefully the events of 1871 in relation to length of residence, the general inferences being that the large majority are comparatively short-term residents, and that both recoveries and deaths are more numerous in the earlier periods of residence. The mortality is very unequally distributed, being much greater at Dacca than elsewhere. 12. As regards the causes of mortality of 101 deaths, dysentery and diarrh( 4 ) cost of each patient to Government (excluding payments by friends) was Rs. 85-6 per head. Of this, Rs. 36-6-5 was for establishment and Rs. 46-14-4 for diet. The cost of establishment at Cuttack was extremely high (Rs. 72-10-3 per head), or Rs. 30 more than at Dacca, Patna, and Moidapore. Dullunda cannot be brought into comparison, as the Superintendent's salary is not taken into account in the table. It appears also that, owing to the entertainment of extra establish- ment from the industrial funds of each asylum, the comparison generally is fallacious. The cost of diet per head ranges from Rs. 58-15-1 in Dullunda, to Rs. 18-6-8 in Moidapore. In future years the Lieutenant-Governor wishes half the salary of the Superintendent to be shown in the statement of Dullunda establishment, and all the subordinates entertained to be taken into account in calculating the average cost of the patients in each asylum. 18. The Lieutenant-Governor would particularly wish to be favored with a special report regarding the boarding out of lunatics on what is called the Gheel system, alluded to in the Inspector-General's 43rd paragraph. It will be extremely desirable if we could get rid of some of the harmless lunatics in this way. 19. Dullunda.( 5 ) The total value of lunatic labor for the year was Rs. 7,992-14-8½, and the balance to credit of the industrial fund at its close was Rs. 6,334-9-6. 21.

No. 348. FROM J. CAMPBELL BROWN, ESQ., C.B., Inspector-General of Hospitals, Indian Medical Department, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL. Dated Fort William, the 20th June 1873. SIR, I HAVE the honor to submit the reports and returns of the lunatic asylums of Bengal for the year 1872. Plan on which the report has been prepared. 2. The returns have been drawn up in accordance with the scheme of forms which was appended to the report of 1871. These have been received in a more complete and accurate condition than the returns for the preceding year ; and superintendents have, for the most part, employed them as a basis for their reports, following the arrangement of the statis- tical statements, and discussing them in succession. This is a natural and useful course. It facilitates the comparison of the statistics of the several institutions; and, however carefully statistical statements are devised and prepared, it is, nevertheless, frequently necessary to explain and supplement them by written comment2 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL.

LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 3 Comparison of the statistics of 1872 with those of the five preceding years. 4. The combined statistics of all the native asylums of the province are shown in Statement No. 2 for the year 1872, and the relation of the leading events of the year to the population, and in some cases to the number admitted and treated. Similar figures for the five preceding years are adduced, and a mean of these has been prepared with which the num- bers for the year under report have been compared, the increase or decrease being exhibited in separate columns. Each of the heads of this statement will be considered and analysed in the sequel. The various ratios shown bear an instructive comparison with those of individual institutions. The general inference from this table is, that while the population of asylums is growing, and admissions are increasing in number, the discharges and deaths bear a decreased ratio to the number of residents. This conclusion is consonant with the experience of past years, and coincides with the experience of asylums in other countries. STATEMENT No. 2. Comparison of 1872 with the five preceding years.

In September the report of the Committee, which sat at Midnapore for the purpose of considering the question of converting the district jail into an asylum, was forwarded to this office for opinion. Mr. Saunders, who, during my absence on leave, held charge, represented that the climate of Midnapore was more favorable than that of Berhampore, and that the district jail might easily be converted into an excellent asylum. Further discus- sion on the subject of segregating cri- minal lunatics. 9. In the resolution on the general report for 1871, dated 4th October, the question was again discussed. Doubts were expressed (1) whether all criminal lunatics should be treated exceptionally ; and (2) whether it could be wise to mass together dangerous men ; and (3) the propriety of removing lunatics from their own districts, where they would be constantly liable to be sent up for trial or to be released, was questioned. The Lieutenant-Governor was also not sure whether the proposed new lunatic asylum at Berhampore was well fitted for a criminal asylum on account of its being so much in the station, and thought that perhaps the old jail at Midnapore might suit better. On these points I was instructed to report. After obtaining careful reports from superintendents, I recently represented (1) that it is not necessary to treat all so-called criminal lunatics exceptionallyLUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 7 The statistics of the 12 months of 1872 shown sever- ally. October, and during the last two months of the year undergoes a decrease. The cause of this feature it is not very easy to assign. The following table gives the principal events of asylums, month by month, in relation to strength:8 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. Re-admissions. 16. Re-admissions constitute 11 per cent. of the whole number against 12.7 in 1871, and 12.3 in 1870. Among criminal lunatics, re-admissions amounted to 11.3, and among non-criminal lunatics to 10.9. The observations of superintendents confirm Dr. Payne's state- ment in his report for 1871, that re-admissions mostly mean repeated intoxication, or the return to the asylum of an acquitted criminal, who had been discharged to take his trial.

Females constituted 18.9 per cent. of the admissions in 1872 against 21.50 in 1871, and 23.6 in 1870. Mahomedan females are again fewer in relation to males than Hindoo. The figures under Christians and " other classes" are too few to warrant any remark. Liability to in- sanity at different periods of life. 20. Ages of those admitted.10 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL.

The average mortality of the eight preceding years was only 10.2. The mortality of the Dacca Asylum is rather less than in 1871, but is still high. Dr. Wise shows that nearly one-half of the casualties was due to pulmonary disease, and is inclined to attribute this result to the crowded state of the asylum. The death- rate of Dullunda was moderate, and of Patna and Moydapore small. The death-rates of the asylums of other provinces are shown marginally, and, as in pre- vious years, the asylums of Bengal have the advantage. The greatest number of deaths took place in June, October, November, December, and January following. From the state- ment given in paragraph 12, it does not appear that a very great prepon- derance of deaths occurred in any particular season. The numbers of deaths in the four quarters of the year were 26, 33, 22, and 35 and during the six months, April to September, 55 occurred against 61 in the remainder of the year. The figures show, on the whole, an excess in the cold months, but the large number in June tends to restore the balance. The death-rate among males was 13.6, and females 10 2. The figures in 1871 were 12.2 and 11.9. The difference in favor of female lunatics is, therefore greater. The greatest number of deaths took place between the ages of 30 to 40, but patients died in a higher proportion to strength between 40 and 50. according to du- ration of residence. 27.

Dr. Wise makes some interesting observations on the phases of insanity which natives exhibit, and remarks that mental depression culminating in suicide is very common both among Mahomedans and Hindoos. This circumstance would argue that natives are more under the influence of emotion than Dr. Bird's remarks would indicate. The truth of the matter probably is, that the emotional manifestations of natives of India are milder than those of Europeans and Negroes, and that the influence of emotion is more apparent in the latter than the former.

24 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. Health of pa- tients admitted and discharged. 31. Sickness.LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 25 Cause of apparent increase of cost. Money realized for maintenance. The total cost of native asylums amounted to Rs. 88,057-7-1, or Rs. 97-8-3 per patient. The figures for 1871 were Rs. 75,255-6-8 and Rs. 90-9-5. The increase of cost is mainly owing to the inclusion of half the salary of the Superintendent of the asylums at the Presi- dency in the Dullunda accounts. The increased numbers under treatment also account for part of the increase of actual cost. The whole cost of the asylums is not exhibited in the above sum; for establishment and other charges which have been defrayed out of industrial profits are still shown as separate statements. In future, the gross cost of asylums will be shown in the accounts by the addition of the money expended for the establishment, appliances, material, &c., required for industrial purposes ; and by deducting the sums actually received for maintenance, and by the sale of manufactures, the true net cost of these institutions will be exhibited. It is satisfactory to find that the amount realized for the maintenance of patients has ex- ceeded that obtained in previous years. The average cost of each lunatic has been thereby reduced to Rs. 94-11-9, against Rs. 85-6-0. Were the net profits of the industrial system added, a still further reduc- tion would be manifest. This will be shown clearly in future reports. YEARS. Total cost of Asylums. Amount realized for maintenance. Ratio per cent. Rs. A. P. Rs. A.

At present the excess of the proceeds of sales over expenditure for establishment, appliances and material is devoted by super- intendents to making purchases and provisions, which Government would otherwise have to pay for. The net cost would, therefore, not be very different from what it is. A large amount of labor is also performed by lunatics, which does not actually yield money, but which would otherwise add to the expense of asylums by entailing the necessity of hiring labor. The value of this labor is a clear gain to the asylum, and is shown in detail in each report The statement on the margin exhibits the amount realized by the sale of manufactures in each asylum, and the value of the labor performed during the year. The first item, as I have remarked, cannot be written off against expenditure, because the outlay necessary to produce it has not been included in the gross cost, nor the further outlay which the so-called profits admitted of. The statement is, however, a most interesting one, and highly creditable to all concerned. ASYSUMS. Amount realized by the sale of manufactures. Estimated value of lunatic labor. TOTAL. Rs. A. P. Rs.

Statement No. 11 further shows the average cost per patient of establishment, diet, bazaar, medicines, contingencies, and clothing. The establishment charges exceed those of 1871. There is an increase in the Dullunda Asylum for the reason already assigned, and a decrease in each of the others. The cost of establishment at Cuttack is very high ; but it is a small asylum, and requires a larger staff in relation to the number of patients. As compared with Moydapore, however, which is a still smaller institution, the excess is caused by a larger number of servants on higher wage being entertained. Details of establishment are given in Statement No. 12. The cost of dieting is nearly Rs. 4 a head, less than in 1871. The reduction is owing to the cost of raw materials, from which articles of food are manufactured in the asylum being shown, and not the cost of the manufactured articles. The other items demand no remark. 34. Statement No. 12 shows the sanctioned establishment of each asylum as it stood on the last day of the year. The relation of attendants to the number of lunatics resident throughout the year is also shown. * Includes Rs. 5,747-10-3, value of manufactured articles made over for the use of the asylum. G

The new system came into force on the 1st of September of the year under report. The accounts of the asylum will now exhibit the whole cost of the institution, which no previous financial statements have done; while the power of the superintendent in disposing of industrial profits for the good of the patients, or developing or modifying the industrial system has not, on account of the large discretion left to him, been materially limited. The question of applying these rules to the other asylums of the province is now under the consideration of Government. Accounts. 43. The accounts of the asylum are clearly shown in Tables Nos. 18, 19, 20, and 21 appended to the report. As the new system only came into force on the 1st of September, I refrain from commenting on them. I would remark, however, that, owing to the system of purchasing food and clothing for the patients in the form of raw material, the cash receipts and actual profits must fall short of the amount expended on raw materials. The asylum, how- ever, effects a very material economy in thus supplying itself. Water-supply. 44. The water-supply of the asylum is a difficult question. There are no means of bathing for the patients in the hot weather within the asylum grounds. They have, there- fore, to be taken to a tank situated in the centre of the maidanLUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 29 Cures. Deaths. ratio to strength. The number of cures was below the average of the past ten years, both actually and in relation to strength. The number discharged improved was also rather less, but the relation to strength a little better. The number discharged " otherwise," mostly escapes, has undergone a satisfactory reduction. The death-rate continues high. Dr. Wise enters fully into this subject, and gives a detailed account of each fatal case. The inference which he draws, that the unusual prevalence of pulmonary affections is due to the overcrowded state of the asylum, cannot be resisted. This has been repeatedly represented during the year. Lunatics from Cachar and Julpi- goree. 50. The disproportionate number of lunatics received from the Cachar district has already been alluded to, and an inquiry into the subject suggested. I would also invite attention to what Dr. Wise writes on the subject of lunatics sent from the district of Julpigoree. Attendants. 51. Notwithstanding the increase in the wages of attendants mentioned in last report, (paragraph 41) Dr. Wise reports that it is still difficult to obtain good men for the money. A proposal to increase the number of the establishment is at present under the consideration of Government. Accounts of the asylum. 52. Dr. Wise gives a full and clear report of the cost of the institution and of the industries with which the insanes are occupied, and their financial value. As in the Dullunda Asylum, the institution is beginning to supply itself with articles of food and clothing. There can be no objection to showing the value of these in a special account; but it would render the accounts of asylums incapable of comparison with each men if the system of separate industrial funds and separate industrial accounts were permitted. Warming. 53. The efforts which have been made to preserve the lunatics from the effects of cold, by placing stoves in the wards of the hospital, and clothing the patients better, appear to have caused a reduction of bowel complaints. Overseer. 54. Mr. Blackwell, the overseer, resigned his appointment in February, and Mr. Caval- lieri was appointed in his place. (Government letter No. 747, dated 23rd February 1872.) He has given much satisfaction. The native doctor continues to give satisfaction. I fully endorse Dr. Wise's remarks regarding his pay. Inspection. 55. Deputy Inspector-General of Hospitals, H. B. Buckle, C. B., inspected this asylum on the 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, and 21st November. He remarks:30 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. Superintendent. Population. Admissions. Cures. Deaths.

Of the admissions, 22 belonged to the military class, which shows a diminution with respect to previous years, and which is explained by the cause assigned by the superintendent. The management of the institution is carefully and ably conducted. The comfort of the inmates is sedulously attended to, and the state of the asylum and appearance of the inmates indicate that they were receiving all the attention and indulgences that their unfortunate condition admits of. The superintendent gives deserved praise to Mr. De Vere, and the establishment generally have worked well. Employment of the inmates. The want of employment or rather of some occupation to amuse the inmates is apparent; at the same time considering the class and habits of the lunatics the difficulty of providing this is fully acknowledged, and the remark is merely made with the view to calling attention to the subject. The management of the asylum during the past year has been very satisfactory." In these remarks I cordially concur. The question of providing the inmates with occupation would be an easier one, were the institution a place of permanent residence until recovery or death, rather than a mere resting house, until arrangements can be made for sending them elsewhere. 67. The asylum has sustained a great loss in the death of the matron, Mrs. De Vere. Mr. De Vere continues to render excellent service. 68. The accounts of the asylum compared favorably with previous years. 69. The reports of the several institutions included in this report were received on the dates specified in the appended memorandum.

The physical con- dition of the patients is noted as good, fair, or indifferent; but while many of them are fat and look well fed, in reality the nervous force of almost all, if not all native insanes is below par. It is owing to this that they bear sickness badly, and that disease amongst them rarely appears in the acute form. Wasting. Bowel com- plaints. Many of the inmates keep wasting day by day without apparent cause. They may eat and sleep well, but yet they grow thin. This wasting sometimes depends on what is known as inward fever or marked ague, and is checked by giving diffusible stimuli and qui- nine.

The absence of paralysis among the native insanes is remarkable ; the affection being so prevalent amongst lunatics in Europe. The rarity of idiotcy is also noteworthy, and if the condition is as rare in other Indian asylums, the question is worthy of physiological inquiry.

These, as a class, are lazy, obstructive, and mischievous, through the force of bad example.

DULLUNDA LUNATIC ASYLUM. 57 No. 2458 REPORT ON THE DULLUNDA LUNATIC ASYLUM. No. 24REPORT ON THE DACCA LUNATIC ASYLUM FOR THE YEAR 1872. By Surgeon J. WISE, M.D., Superintendent. Comparison of 1872 with previous years. 1. TABLE 1. As noted in last year's report, a correct comparison can only be made between the past and preceding six years. Admissions. 2. During 1872 there was a great increase in the number of males and females admitted. The increase above the average of the previous ten years was, for males 26.7 ; for females 2.4. Re-admissions. 3. The re-admissions, also, were considerably above the average. Thirteen males and two females returned after more or less prolonged residence at their homes. Five had been over five years with their relations; four over two years; two were brought back60 REPORT ON THE Particulars re- garding discharge of criminal lunatics. Of the nine who were discharged, one was delivered over to his sons by order of Govern- ment after a residence of 20 years; one was removed to the Presidency jail at the special request of the visitors; five were transferred to stand their trial, of whom only one has been sent back; one was sentenced to a short period of imprisonment in jail, where he became insane, and after the expiry of his term of imprisonment he was discharged cured; and one escaped. Events shown according to sea- son. 6. Table No. 4 is a summary of the monthly returns; the largest average number resident was, as usual, between July and October. The greatest number of admissions was during the rainy months; of discharges and deaths, during the cold months. The two lunatics who escaped are included among those discharged. Sickness. There is a great reduction in the daily average number of sick, as compared with former years, although the practice of keeping all weakly and demented lunatics under charge of the native doctor is continued. Difficulty in ac- counting for in- crease of admis- sions in 1872. 7. It is difficult to explain why there was such an increase of madness during 1872. The epidemic of dengue fever had its influence; but a marked rise in the numbers sent from zillahs, where that disease was unknown, is also apparent from the records. Overcrowding. In October the crowding of the wards was so great, that I addressed the Magistrate of Dacca and requested him only to send such lunatics as were dangerous, or had no one to look after them, to the asylum. This has been the rule ever since, yet the numbers resident have not materially lessened. Districts from which lunatics were brought. 8. No. 5 shows the religion and zillahs of lunatics admitted during 1872. This asylum receives lunatics from a population, according to the late census, of 10,926,464 adults. Remarkably large number of lunatics admitted from Sylhet. 9. The most striking fact in this table is the great number of lunatics received from Sylhet. With the exception of the zillah of Dacca, from which, for obvious reasons, most lunatics come, zillah Sylhet has always been notorious for the prevalence of insanity. There have been sent 24 insane adults this year from a population of 1,079,472; while the Assam Division, with a population considerably higher, furnishes 15 ; and Mymensing and Backer- gunge, each with inhabitants a quarter of a million more numerous than Sylhet, sent only seven and four respectively. The number of lunatics sent by different districts may depend on the orders issued to the police. 10. It is possible that the apparent prevalence of insanity in one district as compared with another may merely depend on the instructions given to the police. If a Magistrate insists on all homeless lunatics being sent into the sudder station, the proportion of lunatics from that particular district will exceed those from an adjoining district where such an order is not enacted. Peculiarities in the assigned causes of madness in Sylhet lunatics. 11. Comparing the causes of the insanity among the lunatics from Sylhet with those from the Assam Division, the following interesting facts are elicited. Of 36 cases from Sylhet of late years in which a cause has been assigned, seven, or a fifth, have the insanity traced to hereditary predisposition, while of 47 cases from Assam this cause is not assigned in a single instance. Again, in 12 cases, or one-third of the whole, from Sylhet, the mental affection is referred to fever, debilitating diseases, or epilepsy, while in Assam, in as many as eight, or a sixth of the whole number, the madness followed epilepsy, and in five, fever or other disease. 12. It is not, as at first might be assumed, from the tea coolie population that so many mad people come.
DACCA LUNATIC ASYLUM. 61 Insanity among tea coolies. In Sylhet there are only 821 tea coolies, and during the past five years only two coolies have come from that district. During the same period seven coolies out of 19 admissions have been sent from Cachar, and from Assam 13 of 66, or almost one-fifth of the whole number. Caste of admis- sions Kayasths. 13. Sixty-six Hindu males were admitted into the asylum during 1872. Sixteen or one-fourth were Kayasths. This is a large proportion; but it must be recollected that in Eastern Bengal, besides the educated and intelligent Kayasths, there is a very large class called Ghulam Kayasths, the offspring of slaves who perform many menial duties. Brahmins, Chan- dals. Only five Brahmins were admitted, of whom three were of Hindustani tribes. The most numerous Hindu agricultural race in Eastern Bengal is undoubtedly the Chandal. Yet only six men belonged to it. Of the 16 Hindu females, three were Boistubis (Vaishnuvis), two Assamese, and one belonged to each of the following castes:62 REPORT ON THE Subjects for future enquiry. 17. It would be a most interesting, though doubtless a difficult, subject of enquiry to ascertain whether the vegetarian worshipper of Vishnu is less subject to insanity than those who partake of an animal diet. The influence, too, of the various religions met with in Bengal in the production of insanity would form a most valuable study. Until, however, we learn more of the natives, of their religious beliefs, modes of thought, and superistitions, it is mere guess-work to attempt to indicate the classes among whom insanity chiefly occurs, or to assign with any correctness the causes which excited madness. Education of those admitted. 18. Of 248 lunatics examined, including 43 women, of whom none could read or write, 183 were found to be devoid of any education. Of the 65 who had been at school, 32 knew more or less of Bengali; 17 of Arabic ; 4 of Nagri; 5 read Arabic and Bengali fluently; 2 English and Bengali; 1 Persian and Urdu; 1 English and Arabic; 1 read Persian fluently, Bengali with difficulty; 1, a Mahomedan Hafiz, had a thorough knowledge of Arabic, Persian, and Hindee; and 1, a Pundit, could read and write Sanscrit, Bengali, and English. Age of lunatics. * See General Statement No. 5. 19. Table No. 7* shows the approximate ages of patients treated during 1872. The largest number of admissions were between 20 and 30 and 30 and 40. This year there were an equal number admitted during each of these decades. The greatest percentage of cures was between 20 and 30; the greatest mortality between 30 and 40. Duration of in- sanity previous to admission. 20. Table No. 8. Like the previous one, this return only approaches corrcetness. In 74 per cent. of the cases this year, as compared with 78 per cent. of 1871, the duration of insanity before admission has been ascertained. In 55.9 per cent. the insanity had lasted over one year ; and in 18.2 it had existed over five years. In 1871 only 21.2 per cent. of the admissions had nothing recorded or ascertained regarding the duration of the mental disease. In 1872 the ratio had risen to 25.6 per cent. Events according * See General Statements to duration of re- No. 7 and 7a. sidence. 21. No. 9* shows the events of 1872 according to duration of residence. The average residence of each inmate was 1,408 days, or three years and nine months being 142 days less than in 1871. Cures. One-half of the cures were effected within a year of admission, a third before the end of the second year, and only three individuals between the second and fifth years. Improved. Of those transferred in an improved mental state to their friends, 9 out of 16 were discharged within the year. Deaths. Twelve deaths out of a total mortality of 40 took place within the first year. In 1871 the ratio was 20 deaths in 42. The average period of residence of those who died was 977 days. General health of lunatics. 22. No. 10 shows the general health on admission and discharge of lunatics during 1872. As every patient on arrival is carefully examined and his condition entered in the register by me, there can be no doubt of the correctness of these figures. Of the 106 males 57 were in good, 28 in indifferent, and 21 in bad health. Of the 19 females, 8 were in good, 7 in indifferent, and 4 in bad health. Of those admitted in bad health, 10 males and 2 females, or exactly a half in each case, died before the end of the year.
DACCA LUNATIC ASYLUM. 63 Of the 125 admitted, 19 were discharged cured, and 8 transferred improved in mind to their friends. Diseases causing death. * See General Statement No. 8. 23. No. 11* shows the diseases of which the lunatics died, as ascertained at the post mortem examinations. Nineteen, or nearly one-half, died of pulmo- nary diseases. In a few instances, as in the pneumonia cases, the fatal disease was acute in character ; but in the majority it manifested itself after prolonged bad health, and in succession to other affections. Seventeen of the deaths occurred within six months of arrival, and nineteen, or nearly one-half, within a year. In 1871 it was shown that there had been a gradual, but regular, decrease in the average number of days each patient, who died within the previous five years, had spent in the asylum. During 1871 the average was 961 days. This year it has risen, owing to the death of a lunatic after 24 years' residence, to 977 days. One patient from Sylhet arrived in a dying state from diarrh64 REPORT ON THE Types of insa- nity. * See General statement No. 9. 28. No. 12* shows the types of insanity of the total treated during the year. Two-thirds of the treated are entered under the columns of chronic mania and dementia. Having obtained the sanction of Government to introduce the system of paying for the keep of the harmless and friendless of these classes, while resident under surveillance outside the asylum, I trust during the current year to show a decrease in the number of incurables in this asylum. Chronic cases more common among women. As might be expected from the reluctance with which natives commit their women to the care of strangers, the proportion of old incurable cases are more common among them than among men. The proportion during 1872 was 71.6 per cent. of females to 65.8 of males. Religious melan- cholia. 29. Religious melancholia I stated in my last year's report to be unknown among Bengalis. A case narrated. The following remarkable case, at present under treatment, shows that this assertion must be modified:DACCA LUNATIC ASYLUM. 65 reported their being quite sane; but they decline to recommend their release; They are both most useful residents of the asylum. One keeps all the registers of clothing, and the other superintends the weeding of the roads and the general tidiness of the grounds. Causes of insa- nity. * See General Statement No. 10. 33. Table No. 13* exhibits the supposed causes of insanity among those treated during the year. Statement unre- liable. Although a cause has been assigned in all but 20.6 per cent. of the cases, it is impossible to place much reliance on the correctness of the statements sent in by the police; for it is to them we have to trust for obtaining the little information we possess. Even in England there is the same difficulty in arriving at any conclusion regarding the cause of insanity in a large proportion of the admissions. Sir Charles Hood, in his "Statistics of Insanity," states that in 33.2 per cent. of the admissions into Bethlem between 184666 REPORT ON THE It is from among the laboring classes that the lunatic, mad from the effects of ganjah, comes. Of the 93 lunatics treated during 1872, and whose insanity was referred to ganjah, 67 or 72 per cent. were Hindus, 25 Mahomedans, and one was a Native Christian. Sixteen of the 25 Mahomedans came from Dacca or its neighbourhood. Ganjah-smoking as an incentive to crime. 37. I do not believe that ganjah-smoking is an incentive to crime. In the records of this asylum there is no mention of any crime having been committed while the individual was under the influence of hemp. In a special report forwarded to Government in December 1871, it was shown that of 99 criminal lunatics admitted between 1861 and 1870, 39 had their madness referred to ganjah-smoking; but that in no instance was it alleged that the crime was committed while the individual was under the effects of ganjah. During the past year four criminal lunatics were admitted whose insanity was referred to ganjah-smoking. They were all Hindus. One was charged with rape, one with theft, one with murder, and one with grievous hurt. That many ganjah-smokers become criminals is not to be wondered at. Ganjah used to inspire courage. Few, if any, dacoits are to be found who do not make use of the weed to inspire them with false courage, but it is because they are thieves that they do so, and not because being smokers of ganjah they are thieves. The history of the use of hemp corroborates this. It has invariably been used to nerve a man to perpetrate a deed which he has already resolved on doing, and, as the Ramawats hold, to impress on the memory a train of thought that has already been pondered over. Epilepsy as a cause of insanity. 38. Epilepsy as a cause of insanity, was assigned in 13 cases, or one in 25 of the total treated. In 1871 the proportion was lower, or one in 58. The total number of epileptics in the asylum during the year was 15, namelyDACCA LUNATIC ASYLUM. 67 Moral causes of insanity. 42. Moral causes of insanity occasion 28 per cent. of the cases to which a cause is assigned. Grief for the loss of children or parents, and anxiety of mind, are the most frequent exciting moral causes of insanity among natives. Sixteen out of 46 women admitted are said to have been driven mad by domestic losses; while only 33 among 214 males were affected in a like manner. Debauchery. Debauchery is still returned as a moral cause of insanity, but few at the present day who lead dissolute lives, abstain entirely from spirit-drinking, or from the use of intoxicating drugs; as with persons habituated to gangah-smoking, insanity is the result of a combination, of causes. The wild, reckless, and irregular life, and the feeling of self-degradation, have probably more to do with the production of insanity than the sensuality and depravity of their lives. Sickness. 43. In 14 is the annual return of sick patients treated in the asylum during the year. Dengue. The first point of note is the appearance of dengue fever among the inmates. If it is as infectious as it is generally represented to be, it is strange that only 37 of the lunatics were attacked, and that in no instance did the fever spread to patients lying in adjoining beds. Although dengue fever was followed in several instances by insanity, sometimes in the form of acute mania, among the outside population, yet it did not appear to aggravate the mental disease of the lunatic patients. The disease was always mild in the asylum, and delirium was rare. During the height of the fever the patients lay in a torpid state, unconscious of the racking pains, and heedless of everything around them. Only four cases were admitted in June, when the epidemic was as its height in the city ; thirteen in July, none in August, three in September, fifteen in October, and two in Novem- ber. The first case occurred on the 20th June, the last on the 2nd November. Inflammation of the lungs. 44. Pneumonia has been one of the most common and fatal diseases in the asylum this year. It is always a complication to be looked for in protracted fevers, or after any disease causing poverty and deficiency of healthy blood. It is more frequent in Dacca than in any other station known to me. In former years it was attributed to cold, and it was hoped that with warmer clothing and artificially-heated wards the disease would be less frequently met with. Such has not proved to be the case. The lunatics were this year much more warmly clad than any other body of people ; yet the admissions from pneumonia exceeded those of former years. In 1871 only 1.3 per cent. of the admissions into hospital were from this disease. In 1872 the ratio was 6.3 per cent. Cause of excess of chest diseases. 45. In attempting to explain the greater prevalence of inflammation of the lungs during the past year, it is necessary to remark that if the influence of a chill was the direct exciting cause of the disease, we would have the majority of the admissions during those months when the weather is coldest, or when there are the most sudden alternations of temperature. Yet, on analyzing the register, it is found that from January to April and from November to the end of December 12 cases were admitted, while during the warm months 10 cases occurred. Probably due to overcrowding. The true explanation, it is probable, lies in the fact that the wards were all dangerously crowded during the year, and that the lunatics suffered physically, and were for that reason predisposed to catch the disease. It is a well-known remark that pneumonia often becomes epidemic when measles is general. It would be interesting to ascertain if pneumonia has in other stations been as common this year among all classes as it has been in Dacca, and whether this prevalence attended or followed the epidemic of dengue. Bowel complaints. 46. Although affections of the lungs were unusually common, diseases of the bowels, which, in the reports of former years, caused a large percentage of the sickness and mortality, were less common during 1872.
68 REPORT ON THE Dysentery and diarrhDACCA LUNATIC ASYLUM. 69 Money realized for maintenance. 53. The total amount paid by the relatives of lunatics during the year was Rs. 399-12-2, being slightly in excess of that received during the previous year. Of this amount, Rs. 283-3-2 were realized from Cooch Behar, and Rs. 116-9-0 from Dacca. Nothing was paid by any of the other zillahs. Articles produc- ed in the asylum. 54. In the report for 1871, it was stated to be my intention to credit Government with all articles produced in the asylum without charge. During the year vegetables, milk, and oil for food, have been supplied. On these items alone Government has been saved Rs. 1,870-7-2. Cost per patient. For the reason given under the heading of establishment, the yearly cost of each man shows a rise of Re. 1-5-11. The average yearly cost of dieting, on the other hand, has fallen to Rs. 39-9-2 per annum, being Rs. 9-4-7 less than in 1871. The lighting of the asylum has been done, with oil manufactured on the premises, at a cost of Rs. 278-15-8. This explains the reduction under the heading contingencies. The expenditure on clothing, including blankets, has risen slightly. As the lunatics died from the effects of cold, very superior blankets were purchased from the Mozuffernuggur jail at the rate of Rs. 50-5-0 a score. Two hundred rupees were also expended in buying dhosa, or native flannel, for coats. Value of lunatic labor. 55. No. 19 is the estimated value of lunatic labor, for which no payment has been received. As usual only half the bazar rates are charged. Industrial profits. 56 No. 20 is the statement of the actual net profit received in cash from the industry of the lunatics. It shows a balance, after paying for the raw material, of Rs. 1,828-9-9½. To this would, in former years, have been added the value of the manufactured articles men- tioned above, which were given gratis to Government, and which amounted to Rs. 2,149-6-10, and the estimated cost of the stock in hand, namely, Rs. 747. Soorkey. The most remunerative labor has been soorkey-pounding. The material has been ob- tained from the old bricks collected in the improvements, which have of late years been going on in the asylum. This supply being exhausted, it will be necessary to purchase them in future. The profit of the mustard and castor-oil mills is not shown in this statement, because the whole of the profit has been swallowed up in supplying the oil to Government. When the stock in hand is worked off, there will be a slight balance to the good. Castor oil. The manufacture of castor-oil will never be very profitable. The plant is not cultivated to any great extent in Eastern Bengal; and when the seeds are bought in Calcutta, the extra charges, such as boat-hire, insurance, tolls, and gunny bags, enhance the value of the seed and reduce the profits. Mustard oil. The manufacture of mustard-oil is also attended by many difficulties. In February and March the market is glutted with the seed, and the oil rapidly falls in value. If the seed is purchased then and stored, serious loss is caused by the depredations of animals, unless special buildings are provided; and in an asylum these cannot be constructed with safety. Industrial fund. 57. No. 21 shows the annual receipts and disbursements of the industrial fund for the year. The balance in hand on the 1st January was Rs. 6,334-9-6; on the 31st December it was only Rs. 5,714-4-0. This falling off in the amount at credit is owing to the introduction this year of the system of charging nothing to Government for the articles produced in the asylum. As Government has determined on appropriating the whole of the industrial funds of the asylum, there was no reason for showing an increased balance. If the system of former years had been followed, and credit taken for manufactures sold at contract rates to Government, the surplus would have been Rs. 7,863-10-10. The most equitable plan however, if the industrial funds had remained, as the Secretary of State ruled they should, at the sole disposal of the superintendent, would have been to have charged Government either the cost price of the articles manufactured, or, as would have been easier, at a fixed rate less than is fixed by contract. R
70 REPORT ON THE Overseer. 58. With Mr. Camilliri, the overseer of the asylum, I have had every reason to be satisfied. He has taken genuine interest in the manufactures of the asylum, and in encouraging the unatics to be industrious. This year no death has occurred from accident, and very few injuries have been inflicted by the lunatics on one another. These circumstances prove that the care exercised by the keepers has been more constant than formerly. The credit of accomplishing this improvement is solely due to the overseer. I trust that, as a reward for the attention he has devoted to his duties, and for his uniform kindness to the lunatics, Government will sanction the usual reward being paid him from the industrial fund. Native Doctor. 59. Native doctor Prosono Coomar Sen has continued to devote his whole time and thoughts to the treatment of the sick, and though be performs much more laborious duties than other native doctors of his standing, and receives only two-thirds of their pay, yet he works willingly, and is in attendance day and night in the asylum. I intend making a special representation regarding him, as it is unreasonable to expect a young man of his intelligence to remain satisfied with Rs. 25 a month, when all his companions are drawing Rs. 40 in charge of district dispensaries. Attendants. 60. The improved scale of pay has not altered the standard of the men who take employ- ment as keepers. The increase was too small to bring about a change. Wages are so high in Dacca owing to the paucity of labor, that six rupees a month is no temptation to an up-country man. He can easily earn from 8 to 10 rupees a month by working a few hours at the jute manufactories. The men who take employment as keepers are usually Hindustanis, who have married and settled in Dacca, or Mahomedans, who are too lazy to labor for their livelihood. Visitors. 61. The asylum was visited on the 24th August by the Lord Bishop of Calcutta; on the 12th March 1872 and 13th September 1872 by Mr. Heeley, the Inspector-General of Jails; and on various occasions during November and December by the Deputy Inspector-General of Hospitals. The visitors have also made regular monthly inspections of the asylum and lunatics Memo. No. 1514, from the Deputy Inspector-General of Hospital, Dacca Circle, to the Secretary to the Inspector-General of Hospitals, Indian Medical Department, Dated Shillong, 13th February 1873. FORWARDS the annual returns and report of the Dacca Lunatic Asylum. The superintendent has submitted a well-arranged and lucid report, replete with information, and showing a knowledge of the habits and social customs of the classes from which insanes are admitted into the asylum, the result of thoughtful study not only of the inmates of the institution but of native customs generally, the possession of which enhances the value of his high professional attainments. Mr. Camilliri fully deserves the favorable mention made of him; he is kind, attentive, and judicious in his management of the insane. Native doctor Prosono Coomar Sen also deserves praise. At an asylum the inmates have constantly to be watched to detect the beginning of sickness as much as possible, so that a native doctor's duties are nearly constant, not ending when the patients in hospital have been attended to.

On the morning of the 7th October he was admitted with all the symptoms of dengue fever. During the night of the 8th he became delirious and comatose with a temperature of 103° 8'. In the afternoon, the thermometer recorded 104° 6'. The urine drawn off, was highly albuminous. On the 9th the temperature was 102° 8' at 4 a.m.; and 104° 2' at 2 p.m. He died two hours later. Beneath the arach- noid a large quantity of sero-purulent fluid was found. In ventricles masses of flocculent pus floate 1 in the fluid. On the under surface of the cerebellum, and around the medulla, pure pus was deposited. " Secon- dary meningitis," as it has been called, occasionally occurs along with other eruptive fevers, but I believe it is exceedingly rare during dengue. 229 28 Katoo Das ... ... ... Julpigoree ...

Stringent measures were adopted to isolate the inmates, as far as possible, from the outside population, and I have no doubt that the result was partly due to the precaution taken. The daily average number of sick was 10.33 against 15.99 in 1871; whilst, if the ratio per cent. of sick to average daily strength in each year be taken, the difference is even more apparent. Death-rate. Mortality.88 REPORT ON THE Duration of insanity. Table No. VIII is compiled chiefly from information derived from the descriptive rolls, and I do not think that this is much to be relied on. It is at all times a difficult matter to obtain exact information from natives ; and unless pains are taken to arrive at the truth, which is, I imagine, seldom the case, they are as likely as not to be a year or two, or a month or two, out in their calculations. Health on admis- sion and dis- charge. Table X shows the state of health on admission and discharge. From this it appears that out of 16 deaths which occurred, only two were in good health when received into the asylum; of those discharged, all but one had gained in weight. Causes of death. * See General Statement No. 8. Table XI* calls for no special notice. One death occurred from cancrum oris. This man had been treated for the same disease in the previous year, and cured. He was in a very cachectic state for a long time, and ultimately the disease re-appeared in conjunction with fever, and ended fatally. The patient who died from psoas abscess was an old, emaciated man, quite unable to stand erect. He was found under a tree by the police within a few yards of the Commissioner's compound, and had a suspicious-looking knife in his possession, and a large bundle of old clothes. He had apparently come from Lucknow. How he had managed to travel so far in such a state is a mystery. The abscess had just commenced to point, before his death, below Poupart's ligament; it was apparently dependent on debility, as no disease of the spine could be dis- covered to account for it. Restraint. Restraint.PATNA LUNATIC ASYLUM. 89 Error in last year's table. in 1871 on 31st December was Rs. 2,079-8, exclusive of Rs. 276-3, value of stock in hand. The table as printed in the Inspector-General's report for that year seems to have been altered in his office,* as the balance is there made out to be only Rs. 1,803-5. These figures have been arrived at apparently by subtracting the value of stores in hand (Rs. 276-3) from the balance Rs. 2,079-8-1, under the supposition that these were included in the latter sum; whereas Rs. 2,079-8-1 represented the actual cash in the Bank on 31st December.

I only took charge of the asylum from Dr. Fleming a few days before the end of the year, so that I am not able to speak from personal knowledge of the events of the year; the returns, 21 in number100 REPORT ON THE Details of fatal cases. No. 4.CUTTACK LUNATIC ASYLUM. 101 Out of this total of 69 individuals, 13 died, 5 were discharged cured, 1 was made over to friends, 1 transferred from civil to criminal, and 49 remained at the end of the year. There were, thus, 7 per cent. of recoveries, and of these the average period under treatment was one year and four months; 2 recoveries occurred within six months after ad- mission. Causes of insa- nity. 7. I do not think much reliance can be placed on the accuracy of the alleged causes of insanity; and I believe that many of the cases are attributed to ganja smoking by the police or the patients' friends, as being the only cause they can think of. Natives of India almost invariably assign a cause for every phenomenon that they observe. Of the 14 admissions in 7 cases, the disease was attributed to ganja, and in 2 it was said to be hereditary; in 2 cases due to epilepsy, and in 3 the cause unknown. Industries. 8. Most of the lunatics perform some kind of labor. Some work in the garden, which is really very well cultivated, and entirely by their own labor. Others twist string and rope, and a few weave common cloth at the looms. The women spin cotton. No attempt at compulsion is employed, and of course the work is somewhat irregular ; but some work really very steadily. The sale of manufactures realized Rs. 347-15 (of this, garden produce was Rs. 46). The value of the manufactures not sold may be estimated at Rs. 55. Against this total must be deducted Rs. 196, the price of raw material. Mechanical res- traint. 9. No mechanical restraint of any kind is had recourse to in the management of the lunatics, and it has not been found necessary. I think, however, that cases do occasionally occur where some simple form of restraint is less irritating than forcibly hand-holding- for a very violent lunatic. This is acknowledged to be the case in England. Only one accident has occurred, when one of the lunatics, a complete imbecile, apparently with the help of another lunatic, managed to commit suicide by hanging himself in his cell during the night. Cost of the asy- lum. 10. The total cost of the asylum, including the superintendent's allowance, has been Rs. 5,213-0-6, or Rs. 101-4-1 per head of the daily average strength. The cost of diet has been Rs. 31-8-3 per head. The cost of diet has been Rs. 6 per head more than in the previous year. The chief reason of this is, that the average prices of rice, dall, salt, oil, and spice were very much higher in 1872 than in 1871, especially during the months of June to October, after the great floods which took place in June. The cost of extra diet for the sick, too, rose from Rs 45 to Rs. 195. The chief items of this being milk, meat, rum, sugar, and sago, which were required for the number of patients suffering from extreme debility and exhaustion; 11 of the deaths were cases of this nature. Difficulty in in- troducing the sys- tem of contract. 11. With regard to introducing the system of contracts by public tender for the supply of diet and other articles to the lunatics, if it could be managed, it would certainly be an advantage and save trouble ; but I fear that in Cuttack it is hardly possible. There are no contractors or people accustomed to give supplies in such a manner, and the price of provisions varies so suddenly and so enormously at different times, that the result of my inquiries is, that no one would take such a contract for a year on anything like reasonable terms, and it would cost very much more to feed the patients by contract than to continue the present arrangement of paying for the supplies at the current bazar rates. The matter is to come before the next meeting of the visitors. Overseer. 12. The overseer, Shaik Emamoodin, and the 8 warders, have generally performed their duties satisfactorily. z
102 REPORT ON THE Attendants. The lunatics are treated with kindness, and are at the same time firmly and judi- ciously managed. Of the 8 keepers, one is a supernumerary, sanctioned only for the present year; but as the average number of lunatics is now over 50, and 2 of the keepers are females, it will, I consider, be necessary that the extra warder should be kept on, as 5 keepers would be insufficient to look after 40 male lunatics, they having to perform both day and night duty. The warders are all paid at the same rate of Rs. 6 each per mensem; but I am strongly of opinion that the pay of 2, at least, should be raisedCUTTACK LUNATIC ASYLUM. 103 No. 1.

Bhang is made into sobzi or siddhi, by rubbing up the leaves with melon seeds, spices, sugar, and water. It is used in the hot season only, when it is considered a cooling and refreshing drink. The piece of the bhang leaves is also mixed with sugar, milk, and butter, and made into a sort of jelly-like sweetmeat, called majum. This is not intoxicating. Like the charas users, the bhang eaters or drinkers do not suffer from its use. Both find this use beneficial rather than the contrary. Their mind is not impaired, nor their sen- sations dulled; their body does not waste nor is premature old age induced. I have not known a case of insanity produced by bhang. There are native maxims which show the different effects of bhang and ganjah more aptly than any statement of mine. They carry a weight, in the way of proof, which is incontrovertible ; hence my recording them. I need not give the translation, it is so simple and evident.

These recommendations are practical and sound; they are supported by the Inspector-General of Hospitals; and the Lieutenant-Governor directs that they be forthwith adopted. 3. His Honor agrees with the Inspector-General of Hospitals that the system of permitting patients or their friends to engage their own attendants is irregular. As, however, the system under which the asylum is maintained expects well-to-do people to pay their way at the asylum, the Lieutenant-Governor has no objection to permit patients or their friends providing such extra comforts and extra attendants as may be desired, particularly as Govern- ment cannot undertake the cost of such extras; but extras paid for by patients and their friends must never take the form of extra attendance or care from the asylum servants, who must not be permitted to supplement their wages received from Government, by accept- ing extra allowances from patients. If patients or their friends wish it, extra attendance must be engaged for them by the asylum authorities at their expense. Outsiders must not, moreover, be admitted into the asylum, unless they conform to the general rules of the institution, and conduct themselves properly. 4. The Lieutenant-Governor desires that the thanks of Government be conveyed to the gentlemen who formed the committee, for the very careful and concise report submitted by them on the accounts of the Dullunda Lunatic Asylum. ORDER.APPENDIX. 137 No. 125, dated Fort William, the 3rd May 1872. From138 APPENDIX. well as arrangements for accommodation, watch and ward, and maintenance. The actual expense of the whole asylum system will thus be capable of exact estimation; different institutions will bear comparison with each other and with those of other countries, when all debits and credits are invariably shown in a general balance sheet, and the precise expendi- ture necessary to secure certain results will be capable of accurate record. The accounts hitherto rendered are imperfect and fallacious, and offer no certain guide as to the liability which must be incurred in establishing new institutions of the kind. 4. As the debit and credit account of the asylum has thus been unified, one general budget for the financial year is rendered necessary, and the industrial budget will be merely a section of the general budget and must be drawn up for the same period. The experience of previous years will be the guide to the amounts entered under the head of raw materials, indulgences to patients, other items, &c. &c., and the superintendent will have a considerable latitude in providing particular articles according as he may find it necessary or advisable under such general heads. All similar undertakings and entries should however, I submit, be shown under one heading. Thus, such entries as establishment, new buildings, repairs of buildings, should be shown under the same head, whether the expense of such provision has hitherto been met by Government, the industrial fund, or receipts from paying-patients. * In this office letter No. 101 of the 29th April 1872. APPENDIX. 139 8. No forms for exhibiting in the annual administrative returns and reports the financial circumstances of the year have been drawn up. A general balance sheet will be simple enough; but it appears desirable to show also the precise profit obtained by the industry of the patients, and it appears difficult to determine what things should be debited and credited in order to do this accurately. The general balance sheet will certainly exhibit receipts against expenditure ; but it may be desirable to frame particular accounts showing the cost and profit of gardening, manufacture, &c. The opinion of the Accountant-General would be valuable on his head. 9. When Government has decided on this report, two other questions will arise; first, the extension of the rules to other native asylums ; and second, the modification of existing rules for the management of native asylums which have become imperfect and inappropriate. On these points I defer submitting any observations until the suggestions now submitted have been considered. I would, in fine, solicit attention to my letter No. 1226, dated 1st March, in which several important points connected with asylum management were discussed. To THE INSPECTOR-GENERAL OF HOSPITALS. Dated Calcutta, the 9th April 1872. As directed by Government, we have the honor of forwarding through you the report of the committee on lunatic asylums' accounts, appointed under the resolution of His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, dated 14th December last. 2. In the resolution above referred to, the attention of the committee was directed to the following points :.140 APPENDIX. 6. The books to be kept should consist ofAPPENDIX. 141 Appointment of accountant. 14. Before quitting the question of accounts, the committee desire to express their opinion that it is essentially necessary, if the accounts of asylums are to be properly kept in the manner now prescribed, that each superintendent should be allowed the services of a good accountant on a suitable salary, from Rs. 40 to 60, according to the size of the asylum. Diet scales. 15. In deciding the question of diet scales, it was deemed desirable to have a scale care- fully drawn up by the medical members of the committee, who possessed special experience in such matters. Their views on the subject, together with the form of diet roll, the adoption of which is recommended, are entered in Appendix C. The committee concur in the suggestion of the medical members, and recommend the adoption of the diet scales framed by them for the Bhowanipore and Dullunda Asylums. Contract system. 16. The last point on which the committee are called on to express any opinion, is the question of supply for asylums. On this head they concur in the opinion expressed in your report to Government, No. 851 of the 23rd November, that a system of public contract is the most appropriate plan for supplying public institutions of this description. 17. The extension of the same system to all articles of supply of every description is advocated by Mr. Saunders; but, in the opinion of the majority of the committee, some discretion in this point should be left to the superintendent, and the system should not of necessity be applied to articles, such as raw materials for manufactures.

APPENDIX. 143 B. Rules for the guidance of Officers in charge of Lunatic Asylums in the accounting for money stock, &c. A cash-book is to be kept in the form annexed, in which all receipts and payments shall be recorded daily. At the close of each day, the totals of the sums received and paid during the day shall be carried to the grand total column and a balance struck; the balance to be checked and initialed daily by the superintendent. Receipts other than those received from a Government treasury are not available for disbursement; they should be remitted in tact to the district treasury daily. The present system of payment of private servants will be discontinued under this rule. Their cost will be budgeted and charged as temporary establishments; recoveries from patients being credited under asylum receipts. Payments must be made either from the permanent advance or from money received from the treasury on abstracts or bills. Refunds to relatives, of money advanced for paying-patients, must, for instance, be charged in bills. In the case of purchase of stock, the quantity as well as value should be given, and a note made in the last column of the cash-book, intimating that the purchase has been credited on a given date in the stock ledger. A stock ledger is to be kept of each article in stock. Every receipt of stock for cash paid is to be checked by the debit in the cash-book; all other receipts to be carefully examined, and both to be initialed by the superintendent daily. Every issue for cash must be supported by a credit in the cash-book, the fact of credit having been afforded, being recorded in a column opened for the purpose in the ledger. These and all departmental issues must be initialed daily by the superintendent. Each ledger must be balanced monthly under the signature of the superintendent. Stock to be taken at least once in every six months, but on varying dates. A note of date of stock taking to be always entered in the ledger for the information of the visitors and Deputy Inspector-General; a permanent advance of Rs. 100 to be allowed. Out of this sum all petty contingent charges should be paid, the amount being recovered by presentation at the treasury of abstracts, weekly or fortnightly. The superintendent must be careful to present an abstract at the treasury on the last open day of the month, so that all payments out of his permanent advance during the month will appear in the abstract as well as in the detailed bills of the month. There should be one abstract and detailed bill for asylum contingencies, and another for expenditure connected with manufactures. The detailed contingent bills of the month should not be presented at the treasury, but should be forwarded to the Deputy Inspector-General for countersignature. That officer will examine, countersign, and transmit them to the Accountant-General for comparison with the charges in the treasury accounts, and for recovery of any retrenchment which the Deputy Inspector-General may have noted in the bills. The superintendent is allowed a discretionary power of outlay up to Rs. 200 for any one article. This restriction does not apply to purchase of raw material for manufactures, the expenditure on which is limited by budget grant only. Any proposal involving a total dis- bursement of more than Rs. 500, requires the previous sanction of the Inspector-General. Establishment bills do not require the countersignature of the Deputy Inspector-General. A duplicate may be forwarded to that officer for his information, if required.
144 APPENDIX. C. European Asylums. The sub-committee in procuring the diet scales for this institution see no necessity to depart from the scales laid down in the medical code for European hospitals, the same scales and classes of diet being adhered to in both cases. We consider the scale ample with regard to quantity, and the list of extra articles is practically unlimited (vide Chapter XIII., page 94, Medical Regulations). Native Asylums. The sub-committee are of opinion that the following classes and scales of diet should be adopted in future in native asylums. The extra article lists remaining discretional with superintendents.

In future reports the earnings of the asylums and expenditure from the industrial funds will be brought into the general account, so as to exhibit more correctly the actual cost of these institutions to Government. Meantime it is satisfactory to know that Rs. 27,635 were realized by sale of articles, while the value of lunatic labor rendered to the asylums was Rs. 14,703. Dullunda is still far ahead of other asylums in industrial management. 11. (Paras. 35-36).( 4 ) Dr. Wise brings to notice the curious fact that a disproportionately large number of lunatics comes from Sylhet, and states that this is notoriously the case in most years. The Magistrate will be asked if he can throw any light on the point. 18. The mortality in the asylum was high( 5 ) and that this causes hardship to the rightful owners. This is a matter which Magistrates have it quite in their power to remedy. If the case is clear, the property should be made over to the owner and a receipt taken. 26.

SIR, Plan of returns and reports. I HAVE the honor to submit the reports and returns of the lunatic asylums of Bengal for the year 1873. 2. The returns submitted by superintendents have been drawn up in accordance with the scheme of forms prescribed in 1871, and their reports have been prepared according to the plan explained in paragraph 2 of last year's report. In dealing with the statistics of the year under report, I possess the advantage of being able to compare them with those of the preceding ten years. The memorandum appended to this report, and the tables which illustrate it, have been very creditably put together by Mr. N. W. Bancroft, the assistant in charge of the statis- tical branch of this office, who voluntarily undertook the troublesome but useful task, which he has so well accomplished. Summary of statistics. 3. The leading statistical events of each asylum are summarily shown in statement No. 1, which has been drawn up on the same plan as in previous reports. Table No. 1, appended to the report of each asylum, exhibits these events in relation to those of the ten preceding years. I shall discuss anything worthy of particular notice in these figures in my remarks on each asylum.

The admissions in 1873 were fewer by 27 than in 1872, and the discharges and deaths more numerous by two. Increase of criminal lunatics. 6. The remarkable increase which has taken place in this class of the asylum population is clearly shown in table No. IX of the appendix, which exhibits the statistics of the 10 years 1863-72. From an average strength in 1863 of 86, they have increased to a strength of 212 in 1873. The percentage of the asylum population which these criminal lunatics constitute, has also increased somewhat; the proportion which they bore to the whole asylum population in 1873 being 21.4 per cent., against 21.6, 209, 20.5, 22.4, 18.1, 17.9, 18.4, and 19, in the eight preceding years, reading backwards. Cause. 7. The cause of this increase of criminal lunatics in asylums consists mainly in the difficulty which besets their release, owing to the peculiar relation which they hold to the law and executive Government; for, whereas other lunatics may be discharged by the visitors either on recovery or on the application and undertaking of their friends, criminal lunatics can only be set loose by permission and sanction of Government; and this, more particularly when the crime which they have committed has been a serious one, is not accorded without very strong evidence of complete and sustained recovery.

The corresponding percentages rendered by the averages of the previous ten years are 52.6, 14.7, 2.5, and 30.2. The larger proportion of recoveries and smaller proportion of deaths are very satisfactory. The larger number of cases discharged otherwise, mostly escapes, in the figures of recent years, is owing to these having been formerly included among the recoveries. As a matter of fact, the majority of lunatics who succeed in effecting their escape have recovered their reason; but the present practice of including such cases among those discharged "otherwise" is undoubtedly the correct one. Discharges do not appear to have been specially numerous in any particular season. Recoveries compared with previous years. Recovery-rates. According to sex and age. ASYLUMS. PER CENT.

No asylum contained any resident of above 30 years, asylum age. These figures show how rapidly lunatics pass through asylums, and how few spend long terms of residence in these institutions. I am not in a position to discuss these interesting results in comparison with those rendered by the asylums of other countries, or by the past history of native asylums in general, but merely place the figures on record as interesting facts relating to the popula- tion of these institutions. In future years a comparison with these figures will give useful conclusions as regards the physiology, if I may so write, of asylums. No. 7. Results according to duration of residence.

For the Year 1873. By Surgeon-Major J. WISE, M.D., Superintendent. Admissions. Table 1.DACCA LUNATIC ASYLUM. 37 Caste of the admissions. By the natives of Dacca the residents of Sylhet are regarded as very penurious, impul- sive, and immoral. Whether this be a correct delineation or not, there is no doubt that the higher Hindu castes of Sylhet intermarry much more frequently than they do in other parts of Bengal. The information regarding the prevalence of insanity in Sylhet is as yet very defective, and we must await further inquiry before arriving at any accurate conclusion. Only ten lunatics came from the Assam province, or five less than in 1872. Sixty-seven Hindus were admitted during the year. Eighteen, or one in 3¾, were Kayasths; while in 1872 they numbered one in four. Kayasths. It is a curious fact also that 12 out of 69 criminal lunatics treated belonged to this generally prosperous class, and that 4 out of 19 criminal males admitted during the year were Kayasths. I find also that of 281 males sent to the Dacca Jail during 1873, as many as 73, or over a quarter, claimed to belong to this caste. There are considerable differences in social position among the Kayasths of Eastern Bengal. Those on the west of the old Brahmaputra refuse to intermarry with those on the east, the former claiming to be the only pure race. The lower grades cultivate the soil, and work as coolies, domestic servants, and shop-keepers. Wealth, however, sweeps away all differences, and in reality the caste has no sub-division. Of the 18 Kayasths, six came from Sylhet, five from Dacca, four from Fureedpore, two from Tipperah, and one from Mymensingh. Brahmins, &c., It is remarkable, too, that the four castes of Eastern Bengal which furnish the greatest number of educated Baboos and enterprising traders, namely the Brahmin, Baidya, Kayasth, and Shaha, should send one-half of the whole Hindu lunatics to the asylum. They are certainly less numerous than the agricultural or fisher castes. Chandals. Eight out of sixty-seven belonged to the Chandal caste, which is the principal Hindu agricultural caste in Eastern Bengal. Mahomedans. There has been a slight decrease in the number of Mahomedan men admitted, but the proportion of Mahomedan females has risen. Twelve Hindu women were admitted; two were Kayasths, and one belonged to each of the following38 REPORT ON THE During the past year the mortality was five under one month's residence; twenty within six months; and thirty-one within a year. It would be difficult to find stronger evidence of the very unsatisfactory state of the present Dacca asylum than is furnished by these figures. State of health on admission and discharge. Table 10 shows the state of health on admission and discharge of lunatics. In 1872, out of 106 males admitted, 53.7 per cent. were in good, 26.4 in indifferent, and 19.8 in bad health. In 1873, out of 102 males, 52.9 per cent. were in good, 33.3 in indifferent, and 13.7 in bad health. The health of the females was a trifle less favorable than during the previous year. Diseases causing death. Table 11 shows the diseases of which the patients died during 1873. One, a woman from Dacca, who had attempted to cut her throat, died in eight days of congestion of the lungs; one, a man from Noakholly, was ill on admission with pneumonia, of which he died in nine days; one, admitted from Dacca in the last stage of debility and cachexia, died in fourteen days; one, a woman, drowned herself after twenty-eight days' residence; and one, a female, arrived from Chittagong with diarrhDACCA LUNATIC ASYLUM. 39 Paralysis. One case of paralysis of the insane was under treatment during the year, but death was caused by a casual attack of pneumonia. Shaik Mahomed, aged 55, a bheesti by profession, had been an inmate of the asylum over four years. Difficulty in articulating, a dribbling of saliva, incoherent talk about Rs. 12 due him, and a hurried unsteady walk, were the chief symptoms of the brain disease. From the 1st November 1872, until his death on the 28th May, his temperature was recorded twice daily. The morning entries always exhibited a temperature lower than in health, even during the hot months, while the evening register was occasionally above normal range. On the 24th May he was attacked with pneumonia, which ran a very acute course. On the third day the highest point registered was 104°, on the fourth 104° 4'. Pneumonia. Pneumonia was less prevalent in 1873 than in 1872; but still the admissions and deaths from this disease were excessive. In 1871 the admissions from inflammation of the lungs made up 1.3 per cent. of the total admissions; in 1872, 6.3 per cent.; and in the past year, 2.8 per cent. The mortality due to this cause has risen greatly. The deaths to seizures in 1871 were 44.4 per cent.; in 1872, 45 per cent.; and in 1873, as high as 47 per cent. In the Dacca jail the deaths to seizures during the past year were only 21.7 per cent. In the report for 1872, this frequency of inflammation of the lungs was referred to the vitiated air developed in the overcrowded cells. On this point my opinion is unaltered. As long as only 28 superficial feet per man is the average allowance, and when most crowded only 26 feet are available, we cannot expect affections of the lungs to diminish in frequency. It is, however, undoubtedly true that since the introduction of the clinical thermometer, many cases, formerly entered as remittent fever, are now correctly classified. The commence- ment of pneumonia in a debilitated lunatic is most insidious, and the faint respiratory sounds heard through the stethoscope are apt to deceive the listener. With the thermometer, however, and a careful estimate of the symptoms, a correct diagnosis is always certain. The disease was not confined to any particular season. Three cases were admitted in January, two in February, two in August, two in September, two in November, and one in each of the following months40 REPORT ON THE In the list of physical causes, we find cholera, fever, debility, leprosy, and syphilis, enumerated. These either cause poverty of blood or are manifestations of a system tainted by some specific poison. In each vertigo is a common symptom. The ratio of treated under these five heads is 7.5 per cent. of the total. Epilepsy. Epilepsy was assigned as a cause in 4 per cent. of the cases in 1872. This year the proportion is only 2.6 per cent. During the year 10 males and six females were treated for epileptic fits. Two diedDACCA LUNATIC ASYLUM. 41 Restraint. Table 15 shows the number of lunatics confined in solitary cells during the year. All lunatics on first admission are separately confined for at least a week, being taken out daily to be bathed and fed. The only means of punishing mischievous or quarrelsome lunatics is to confine them in cells,. and to stop their allowance of tobacco and pân. This discipline is found effectual in all cases. Besides the lunatics confined for these causes, there are always two or three dangerous men, who can only be taken out of the cells under charge of special keepers. They are generally non-criminals. No mechanical restraint was employed during the year. Vaccination. Table l6 shows the number of lunatics who had been inoculated or vaccinated, or were unprotected on admission. Of the 102 males admitted or re-admitted during the year, 2 9 per cent. had been vaccinated, 60.7 inoculated, 10.7 had marks of natural small-pox, and 25.4 were unprotected. Of the 25 females, one had been vaccinated when in the asylum before, 13 had been inoculated, two had marks of small-pox, and nine were unprotected. Lunatics employed. Table 17 shows the average number of lunatics usefully employed during the year. The average number of sick was 24, and the average number of able-bodied persons was 220, namely 177 males and 43 females. On an average 171 males and 42 females were usefully employed. It is not to be supposed, however, that the whole of that number did on any day a fair amount of work. Many of the old inmates, and most of those affected with chronic mental disease, do little real work ; but a good object is attained if, in such instances, they can be got to employ themselves at work, however light. It keeps them out of mischief by placing them directly under the eyes of the keepers, and while so engaged their minds are diverted from their own morbid thoughts and delusions. Finances. Table 18 shows the annual expenditure on account of the lunatic asylum for the year. By Government letter No. 1037 of the 13th March, the permanent establishment of keepers was raised from 20 to 22, at an additional charge of 12 Rs. per mensem. This increase explains the slight excess under the head " establishment" over 1872. There is an apparent large increase this year under the head of " diet." The price of rice was the same, but that of mutton and fish was higher. The year 1872 was exceptional, as vegetables, milk, and oils, were issued gratis by Government. This year vegetables have been supplied at the contract rate, while milk, castor and mustard oils, have been sold at prices below the bazar rates, namely at prime cost. To these causes, and to the fact that a larger number of lunatics were fed, the increase under this head is to be referred. The charge for " contingencies " also shows an apparent increase; but this year oil for lighting has been paid for by Government, while last year it was obtained without any charge being made. The sum expended on "clothing" was less than in 1872. Three hundred blankets, received from the Mozuffernugger jail, were delivered at the asylum at the price of Rs. 50-8-4 per score. The average yearly cost per man was Rs. 91-8-7; in 1872 it was Rs. 87-7-3, and in 1871, Rs. 86-1-4. The increase last year has been on account of additional establishment. The cost of dieting each man was Rs. 46-12-8; in 1872 it was Rs 39-9-2, and in 1871 Rs. 48-13-9. The total amount received from the friends of lunatics was larger than in any previous year. The Cooch Behar state paid Rs. 517-4-9; the Magistrate of Dacca, Rs. 14-10-6 ; and Rs. 24-12-0 were received for the maintenance of an insane sepoy of the 42nd Native Infantry, according to Act XXI of 1872. Value of lunatic labor. Table 19 shows the estimated value of lunatic labor, for which no payment was received. Table 20 is the statement of the profit in cash of the lunatic labor. Vegetables having been supplied at contract rates, and not given gratis as in the previous year, the gain under the head of garden produce is considerable. The great obstacle to the success of the garden is scarcity of water. The two old asylum wells supply at the most important season a small quantity only. During the year a well of larger dimension has been in course of construction, but is still unfinished. Soorkee-pounding is still the most remunerative labor. After paying altogether Rs. 278-12-0 for bricks and for the repairs of the sheds and pedals, the profits were consider- able, though less than in 1872, when bricks cost nothing. The supply of castor-oil seeds has been uncertain, as the local market has to be depended on. The manufacture of mustard-oil is less profitable than it would be if store- houses for the seed existed. Industrial fund. Table 21 shows the annual receipts and disbursements of the industrial fund for the year. The balance in hand on the 1st January was Rs. 5,714-4; on the 31st December, Rs. 5,968-2-1. Two heavy charges this year had to be met. One was a gratuity of Rs. 400 given by order of Government; the other, a sum of nearly Rs. 700 towards the construction of a well. On the 1st January 1874 the new system of accounts was introduced, and the industrial fund, as such, ceased to exist. F
42 REPORT ON THE Extended accommodation necessary. It is quite clear, from the returns now submitted and those of former years, that much remains to be done to render the Dacca asylum a fit residence for the lunatics of Eastern Bengal. For four years nothing has been done towards extending the accommodation. The scheme for improving the asylum, which met with the approval of the Government in 1867, was hardly entered upon before it was suspended; and year after year the visitors, Inspector-General of Jails, Deputy Surgeon-General, and the superintendent, have repeatedly urged upon Government the absolute necessity of building new wards for the accommodation of the lunatics, but without success. Superficial area of asylum buildings. It was laid down in Government letter No. 796 of the 24th February 1873, "that the minimum amount of accommodation to be allowed to inmates of lunatic asylums in Bengal, whenever practicable, shall be 50 superficial feet." During the past year the average number of males sleeping in the asylum was 196, with only 22 superficial feet of room. The ground area of all the male-cells and dormitories, exclusive of twenty solitary cells and of an average of 19 sick in the hospital, amounts to 4,480 superficial feet. Dividing this by the minimum amount of accommodation sanctioned by Government, the Dacca asylum can safely houseDACCA LUNATIC ASYLUM. 43 The average monthly cost of each man last year in the asylum was Rs. 7-10 per mensem. The saving effected by this system is therefore considerable. The chief obstacle to the success of the scheme is the dread that native gentlemen entertain of being held responsible for the escape or illness of any boarder. When the object of Government is properly understood, this apprehension will doubtless disappear. For many obvious reasons the boarding out of lunatics in the midst of a populous and very immoral city is objectionable; but there is no other course to adopt, unless the residents of the suburbs can be got to interest themselves in the experiment. The difficulty of periodi- cally visiting lunatics boarded out in villages is a serious one; but as the system spreads, it may be also possible to overcome this obstacle. Overseer. The overseer, Mr. Camilliri, continues to give satisfaction. He takes much genuine interest in the welfare of the lunatics, and in promoting the various industrial works in the asylum. His influence over the inmates is considerable, and they appreciate his kindness and thoughtfulness. Native doctor. Attendants. I have nothing to add to my former reports regarding native doctor Prosono Coomar Sein, but that he has continued to show unusual intelligence and attention in the discharge of his duties. It is a matter for regret that Government has not as yet seen fit to reward him according to his deserts. I still hope that Government will reconsider its opinion and sanction a salary equal to what he would certainly obtain by resigning his post in the asylum. It cannot be considered just that a native doctor of the same rank and standing should draw Rs. 40 a month at a small branch dispensary, while the native doctor of the asylum, with a daily average of 24 sick, and with duties that require his attendance at all hours of the day and night, should draw only two thirds of the amount. The increase in the pay of the keepers has not effected any change in the standard of the men who serve as keepers. A few steady and intelligent men are borne on the rolls of the establishment, but the majority are stupid and very lazy. Visitors. The asylum was visited on the 22nd September by Mr. Heeley, the Inspector-General of Jails. The visitors also made regular monthly inspections of the asylum and of its inmates.

Overcrowding. 2. Statement No. 1 shows that the asylum has again been overcrowded, and the transfer of lunatics from the Central Provinces had to be almost stopped, and only those from Cuttack and adjoining districts of Orissa could be admitted. The overcrowding has been confined to the male-wards, in which there is accommodation for 31 males. The daily average male population has been 40.5, and there were 44 males remaining at the end of the year. The female side accommodates 13, and the daily average number has been only 8.7. There is a tendency to a yearly increase in the number of patients, and the present asylum is too small to meet the requirements of the population. A project for building a new asylum for from 80 to 100 lunatics has, I believe, received the sanction of Government. New asylum. A site has been selected between the new general hospital and Jobra irrigation work- shops, at a considerable distance from the town, and the plan of the new asylum, with arrange- ment of ground and buildings, are now under consideration. The site selected, though good in most respects, has one serious objection,62 REPORT ON THE evidences of mental derangement which had been progressing for some time previously.

In most cases of insanity the disease commences by gradually insidious steps, and is chronic, one may say, for a long time before it becomes acute. If we could only get the patients under treatment in the early chronic stage of perverted sense, before the acute symptoms are developed, the disease would in all probability be much more amenable to treatment. The most marked cases of chronic mania are liable to acute paroxysms. In most cases after a time, when recovery does not take place, a condition of dementia supervenes; but in this, again, patients are liable to attacks of mania with excite- ment64 REPORT ON THE Conduct of establishment.

The darogah, Sheikh Emamoodin, has continued to give entire satisfaction. The six male and two female keepers have all been attentive to their duties, which are of an arduous and responsible nature.

A GREAT reduction will be observed in the number of admissions during the year. The method of dealing with insane soldiers from the provinces which has been advocated here for some time, but depended for its complete adoption on the provision of sufficient accommo- dation at Bombay, has, I believe, been rendered practicable now, and accordingly the number of soldiers received at Bhowanipore in 1873 has been only four. Three have been despatched to Europe as ordinary invalids, one has been discharged cured, and the case of a criminal is still under consideration of Government. A locally enlisted soldier was also admitted; but being now discharged from the service, he appears in the return as a civil patient, and being a country-born man will probably continue an inmate of the asylum for some time. Civil lunatics. 2. The admissions from the civil population have also been fewer than usual, numbering only 23. Thirteen have recovered and been discharged; five have returned in improved condition to their friends; six have been despatched to Europe as insane; four have died, and twenty-four remain in the asylum. Mortality. 3. It is unusual in this asylum to record so large a number of deaths. Mr. Kallonas, who had been 20 years in the place, died of heat apoplexy in June; John Aganoor, chroni- cally demented, died in the same month of fever with cerebral effusion; C. F. Cotton, hemiplegic for years, and received in that state from the General Hospital, died in October (extensive yellow softening in the motor tract, and various inflammatory meningeal deposits); and T. Wallace died six weeks after admission from intense cerebral congestion with sero- sanguineous exudation. Causes of insanity. 4. The causation of insanity among so small a number has no technical interest, and affords no data for administrative criticism. I confine myself therefore to noting in the return such conclusions on the subject as the information obtained in each case seems to support. Finances. 5. A special return sets forth the receipts and expenditure during the year. A reduced total expenditure has followed the fall in numbers, and similarly the receipts from paying patients have become smaller than in 1872, while the credit for soldiers' stoppages is comparatively insignificant. For the same reason the charge for fixed establishment, as distributed among individual patients, is higher. Management. It is needless to report that which has been often before reported concerning the arrangements, sanitary and otherwise, of the asylum. The inspections of visitors have been made with unfailing regularity, and their monthly reports have conveyed all necessary information on points of management; but I beg to repeat the testimony I have already borne to the character and qualifications of the head overseer, Mr. DeVere. I can give him no higher commendation than I do in saying that his duties were discharged in 1873 as they were in former years. Of his assistant overseer, Franklin, it would be difficult to speak too highly. Nothing disturbs his steady, sober industry and devotion to work, which make him in his position particularly useful. Mrs. Pearce, the present matron, was appointed soon after my return from furlough. She has shown all the qualities which I was led to expect in her from the testimonials she brought from officers who knew her before.

The management of the institution is most ably and carefully conducted. Attention is paid to everything that can increase the well-being and comfort of the inmates, and the efforts of the superintendent are well seconded by Mr. DeVere, who is a most useful and well- informed resident officer. The matron and the entire establishment have worked well during the year.

Table No. IX exhibits the principal facts regarding the criminal lunatics confined in the Bengal asylums for the 10 years 1863-72. The population of this class of insanes is even more progressive than the general insane population. The census on the 31st December 1872, compared with that on the 1st January 1863, shows an increase of about 149 per cent. The total treated has increased by 163.1 per cent., and the daily average strength by about 128 per cent.; the increase of the general asylum population being during the same period 90.9, 75.6, and 71.3 respectively. TABLE No. IX. Return of criminal lunatics in the asylums of Bengal for the 10 years 1863RESOLUTION. JUDICIAL. Calcutta, the 5th January 1875. READ( 2 ) average strength. Taking the average of the period of ten years, beginning with 1863, the difference appears to have been 6.3 per cent. The result has been that in the course of eleven years past the number of native insanes in confinement has all but doubled. Year by year an increasing strain has been put on the resources of the existing asylums. These institutions cannot be indefinitely extended. Dullunda, it is said, has already reached the limit which, under existing circumstances, cannot be passed with safety. The accommodation in the other asylums is in no way equal to their requirements. The pressure for space has been very great. Since the year closed, a new asylum at Berhampore, calculated to contain 225 patients, has been opened; and till other arrangements are practicable, the Lieutenant-Governor has decided to maintain also the Moydapore asylum, which the new one was meant to supersede. A con- siderable reduction has thus been effected in the number of patients in Dullunda and Patna; but no relief has yet been given to Dacca, where the overcrowding has been worst of all, and accompanied by a lamentably high death-rate. It was the intention of this Government to have pressed to an early completion the construction of an asylum at Tezpore to receive all lunatics belonging to the Assam districts, which, under existing arrangements, send their lunatics to Dacca. The Chief Commissioner has already been addressed on the urgent necessity which exists for such an asylum, and his attention will again be drawn to the matter. Meanwhile temporary expedients must be adopted at Dacca, and full use made of the Lalbagh barracks, in which inoffensive lunatics might remain till further orders. It may be possible, with the com- pletion of the Central Jails at Bhagulpore and Midnapore, to use the district jail at one of these stations as an asylum for insanes, and the subject shall have the attention of Government. As the maintenance of these asylums is becoming more and more expensive to the State, the Lieutenant-Governor hopes that all Superintendents will be careful to exact payment from those patients or their friends who are able to pay, and to make the labor of the inmates as productive as possible. 6. The total number of criminal lunatics who remained in confinement at the close of 1872 was 209. The admissions and re-admissions during the past year amounted to 72, against 65 who were discharged or died, and 216 thus remained at its close. The daily average strength of this class of lunatics was 187.8 males and 24.3 females. It was suggested that a separate asylum should be built for these. In last year's resolution, however, the Lieutenant- Governor expressed his intention to provide a separate asylum( 3 ) As in 1872, there was a decided excess of deaths in the rainy and cold months. The number of deaths among short residents was larger than in either of the two years previous. This is especially noticeable in the Dacca asylum, where the death-rate on the whole was also high. 9. With reference to the causes of mortality, the peculiarities of 1873 are said to have been rather less cholera and more chest disease than usual. Dysentery and diarrh( 4 ) the Medical authorities, desirable that relief should be given by any increase in the accommodation at Dullunda itself, where the asylum has already reached the limits which cannot be exceeded consistently with efficient management. The pulmonary disease which prevailed during the year is pointed to as the direct result of overcrowding. It is observable, however, that it prevailed least in the female ward, where the overcrowding was greatest. The daily average of sick was slightly in excess of that in 1872, but greatly less than in any of the four preceding years. The death-rate was only 10.8 per cent., against 12.4 in 1872, and an average of 14.4 for the five years, 1868-72. The most fatal disease was dysentery. Considering that more than half those who died were, on admission to the asylum, in a bad or indifferent state of health, the results may be looked on as not altogether unfavorable. 14. The extent to which resort was had in asylums to the use of mechanical means to restrain refractory patients in 1872, formed the subject of unfavorable comment last year. The Lieutenant-Governor is glad to observe that in 1873 the practice has been kept within reasonable limits. He has sufficient confidence in Dr. Payne to accept the opinion expressed by that officer, that a certain amount of discretion must be left to the Medical Superintendent in the matter. Without insisting on an absolute abandonment of mechanical restraint, the Lieutenant-Governor hopes that it may be adopted sparingly. 15. The importance of providing insanes with industrial employment both as a preservative of health and as an effective aid in maintaining disci- pline is not lost sight of in this institution. On an average, all the patients present, except 48 including the sick, were engaged in some useful occupation. The total cash outlay in manufactures amounted to Rs. 21,826. The cash sales outside the asylum amounted to Rs. 11,339 only; but including the value of articles made over for asylum use, of those in store, and of the labor employed in repairs and petty constructions, the year closed with a balance of profit of Rs. 5,783. Deducting this from Rs. 49,879, the total expenditure on the asylum, the net cost of each patient is said to have been Rs. 117 only, against Rs. 123 in 1872. The results are satisfactory. 16.

No. 439. FROM THE SURGEON-GENERAL, INDIAN MEDICAL DEPARTMENT, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL, JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT. Dated Fort William, the 7th July 1875. SIR, I HAVE the honor to submit the following report concerning the Asylums for the insane situated in the province of Bengal for the year 1874. Alteration of forms of statistical returns. 2. Since the submission of my report for the preceding year, the forms in which the statistical returns of these institutions are rendered have undergone modification under the orders of the Government of India (Home Department resolution No. 419F, dated 31st August 1874). As compared with those previously in use, the forms now authorized are less numerous and less elaborate. The figured statements employed for the illustration of this report have accordingly undergone a corresponding change. No. 900, dated 4th March 1875. 2 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. STATEMENT No. 1.

LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 3 Comparison with previous years. 5. In statement No. 2 the aggregate results for all asylums are shown in comparison with the actuals and averages of the preceding five years, and certain calculations of percentages are added for the purposes of facilitating this comparison; for it will be observed that an increase in the actual number of occurrences of a particular kind is frequently coincident with a decrease in the ratio which these bear to mean population or number treated. This table will serve as a basis of comment in discussing the number of insane persons in confinement, the admissions, recoveries, and deaths of the year:4 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. Capacity of the several asylums. Moydapore asylum. To that extent the provision of this asylum has effected some relief, and during the current year it will no doubt expand to its utmost capacity; but that the asylum accommodation of the provinces is still much too contracted for health and safety, is very apparent from the following statement:LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 5 Conversion of disused district jails into asylums.

The smaller proportion of such deaths in 1874 is due to the smaller number of casualties registered under " exhaustion from mania" than formerly. This arises either from acute maniacs forming a smaller proportion of the population, or from deaths being assigned to more definite causesLUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 9 Causes of insanity. 19.

Dr. Payne surmises that the use of this bag is extending, because other superintendents are sending for patterns and samples of it. Establishment. 37. No change of any importance has been made in the establishment. The removal of 85 lunatics caused no reductionLUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 13 Bowel complaints. Lung diseases. and phthisis, five other deaths were due to lung complaints14 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. " Bayu" (vertigo.) " Associated with fever in certain cases is bayu, to which the natives commonly ascribe their madness. This term means " swimming of the head, or vertigo." A man says he was out in his field ploughing the ground when suddenly he was seized with bayu, and from that time he remembers nothing until perhaps his admission into the asylum. This bayu, then, is a sign of weakness from one cause or another. Under the head of debility (bayu), eight individuals (strangely all males) are said to have become insane, i.e. 2.13 per cent. of the total treated. Epilepsy. " Epilepsy was assigned as the cause in 4 per cent. of the cases in 1872 ; in 1873 the percentage was 2.6; and in 1874 it has been 2.13 per cent. Of eight cases, six were males and two females. Of these, one (male) died. Congenital. " The congenital cases of insanity were in the proportion of 2.4 per cent. of total treated. Of nine cases, five were males and four females. Debauchery. "Debauchery accounted for 1.86 per cent. of the cases treated. But the term debauchery is a vague one, therefore the figures under this head are probably wanting in scientific precision. Moral causes. " Moral causes during 1874 accounted for 21.06 per cent. of the cases, against 19.60 per cent. in 1873. Grief. " Grief caused madness in 16.53 per cent. of the total cases treated. Of 62 cases, 36 were males and 26 females. The most common causes of great grief were the death of relatives, loss of property and of law-suits, and domestic troubles, such as the desortion of husband from wife, &c. Fear. " The cases which are attributed to fear are associated with the imaginary sight of ghosts, goblins, and evil-spirits. Bhuts and dynes are familiar objects of terror with the lower classes of this country. Religion. " Exaltation of feeling, with perverted judgment, or low melancholy, attributable to associations of religion, occurred in five cases (four males and one female), accounting, together, for only 1.33 per cent. of the total treated during the year. Over-study. " The cases associated with studious habits also occurred at the rate of 1.33 per cent. At one time we see an individual whose madness is altogether mixed up with thoughts of priests, purans, and muntras. At another the Koran or the Bible is the centre of much incoherent thought. One Hindu, now in the asylum, for a long time never moved anywhere without a small flute and a large copy of the new testament in Bengali, from each of which he seemed to derive equal comfort and joy. At last he destroyed the sacred book and broke his flute, and since then he has never been so happy as before. One of the practical tests in an Indian asylum of the state of mind of Muhammadans is the manner in which, and the frequency with which, they attend to their prayers and other religious duties. In the case of many a good Mussulman, who is in the habit of paying due attention to his prescribed religious duties, the approach of a relapse of insanity is indicated by his evincing a sudden and total disregard for all such matters." Restraint and seclusion. 49. No mechanical restraint is employed in this asylum; 104 patients were secluded during the year. " Seventy-nine were confined when under excitement, 25 for wickedness or mischief or quarrelling. There are three or four men who are so dangerous to themselves and others that they are almost always secluded, being taken out every day for about two hours under proper guard." 50. Dr. Smith has the following remarks on the system of boarding out harmless lunatics:LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 15 drawn in the foregoing remarks, amply proves that he possesses a lively sense of the import- ance of the charge, and entertains a just appreciation of the scientific attractions of the subject of mental alienation. I have forwarded a long extract from his report, which is too special for insertion here, to the Editor of the Indian Medical Gazette for publication. PATNA ASYLUM. Superintendence. 57. Patna.16 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. Criminal lunatics. 62. The superintendent finds criminal lunatics the most troublesome, and considers that they ought to be confined in a separate asylum, or in a separate part of the same asylum. Restraint. 63. No restraint of any kind was employed during the year; but Dr. Simpson thinks that the non-restraint system may be carried too far, and that the belt and sack are in many cases useful, and in some beneficial. Causation. 64. On the subject of the causes of insanity he remarks:LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 17 Admissions. 71. The admissions were actually above, but relatively to population about the average of past years. Seven of them were pilgrims from other provinces, and three criminal lunatics. The recoveries were about the average; the transfers to the care of friends above it. The deaths were few, and the rate about half the average. Criminal lunatics. 72. Dr. Stewart alludes to the difficulty of managing criminal lunatics who have become sane in the same institution and on the same principles as really insane persons. Previous history of lunatics. 73. The difficulty of ascertaining the previous history of lunatics is also alluded to. Of 29 admissions, information could only be ascertained regarding 15; 14 of these were addicted to ganjah, and one to opium. Seven of these fourteen cases were discharged cured during the year. Sickness. 74. There was no excessive sickness during the year. A case of suicidal hanging occurred. Employments. 75. The employments which the lunatics are engaged in are gardening, spinning, rope- making, weaving, and wheat grinding. Of an average of 57.84, 41.89 worked daily. Establishment. 76. Some slight additions to the establishment were sanctioned in consequence of the increase of the numbers of residents. The darogah, Shaikh Emamooddeen, is favorably reported upon. Inspection. 77. Deputy Surgeon-General C. R. Francis reports, as the result of inspection, that this asylum is in excellent order, and the inmates quiet, industrious, and well looked after. MOYDAPORE ASYLUM. Superintendence. 78. Moydapore.18 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. Fifteen female patients, in addition, were transferred from the Dullunda asylum in September. These 55 female patients occupied the entire space available for females at 50 superficial feet per patient; 50 males were received by transfer from Dullunda in September. In addition to these, 10 males and three females were received by direct admission from the surrounding districts. Deaths. 88. The deaths were numerous considering the small population and the short time. Regarding them Dr. Shircore writes:LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 19 Fatal cases. 95. Dr. Payne, who superintended the asylum throughout the year, reports that of the three fatal cases, one was due to cholera, another to exhaustion from mania brought on by intemperance, and the third mainly to sunstroke. Nationality of patients. 96. Of the sixty patients treated, thirty-one (twenty-four males and seven females) were European, twenty-four (ten males and fourteen females) East Indian, and five males Armenian. Cost. 97. The total cost of the asylum was Rs. 28,517. Rs. 5,253 were recovered for the maintenance of patients. The whole of the amount due to Government by the estate of Mr. N. Kallonas, with the exception of Rs. 10, has now been received. Dr. Payne writes :APPENDIX. TABLE No I. Class and sex of persons admitted and re-admitted during 1874. 1 2 3 4 5 6 Hindoos. Muhammadans.

The patients belong chiefly to the poorer classes of society, being cultivators, domestic servants, beggars, coolies, or shop-keepers. They are principally drawn from the large towns where the asylums are situated, or from their immediate neighbourhood. Cachar and Sylhet, however, continue to send to our asylums an exceptionally large number of insanes. The age of the insanes when brought to the asylums continues to range generally from 20 to 40 years. 4. In remarking on the increased mortality of the asylums, the Surgeon- General observes that while there was an excess over the average of five years previous of 28.8 per cent. in the absolute number of deaths, the death-rates yet remained nearly the same. The Lieutenant-Governor observes that the ratio of deaths to daily average strength was 13.3, or precisely the same as the average of five years previously: while the ratio to the total number of patients treated was slightly increased, having been 9.3 against 8.9. Contrasting the ratio borne by deaths to average strength in Bengal with the corresponding figures for asylums in other presidencies, we have the following table:( 3 ) lunatics as above indicated, the numbers are not given. The Lieutenant- Governor trusts, however, that, with the extension of the building which has already been ordered to be taken in hand, all room for apprehension in the future on the score of overcrowding will cease. 6. Taking the asylums separately, the general results of the past year may be summarised thus:( 4 ) 11.

ANNUAL REPORT ON THE INSANE ASYLUMS IN BENGAL FOR THE YEAR 1875. BY J. FULLARTON BEATSON, M.D., Surgeon-General, Indian Medical Department. Calcutta: PRINTED AT THE BENGAL SECRETARIAT PRESS. 1876.
No. 369½. FROM THE SURGEON-GENERAL, INDIAN MEDICAL DEPARTMENT, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL, JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT. Dated Fort William, the 13th June 1876. SIR. 1. Dullunda. 4. Patna. 2. Bhowanipore. 5. Cuttack. 3. Dacca. 6. Moydapore. 7. Berhampore. I HAVE the honor to submit my annual report on the working of the Lunatic Asylums (marginally noted) situated in the province of Bengal for the information of His Honor the Lieutenant- Governor. 2. In order to explain more clearly the text of this report, I have retained most of the statistical forms which have been in use in former years; but in the appendix will be found all the asylum statistics entered in the forms approved of by the Government of India, as directed in Home Department resolution No. 419F, of 31st August 1874. 3. Similarly as in last year's report, I now submit the annual reports received from the Superintendents in a summarized form, and on them I shall offer such observations as, I trust, will assist in clearly explaining the working of the asylums during 1875. 4. In statement No. 1 the principal statistical events of the six asylums (Bhowanipore Asylum for Europeans not included) are shown individually and collectively, and in the appendix, in table No. I of the new asylum forms, this collective information is again given, and can be compared with the statistics of the preceding decennial period. 5. Before making any remarks on the statistics contained in statement No. 1, I must observe that owing to the transfer of patients from the Dacca and Patna Asylums to the asylum at Berhampore, the totals of columns 6 and 7E (the former representing the total population, the latter the total discharged,) are not sums of the subsidiary figures. The figures denoting the numbers transferred are properly included in the total population of individual asylums, but if included in the general total they would vitiate the return of 1875 for the purpose of comparison with other years.

There has been a steady and progressive increase in the asylum population " remain- ing " on the 1st of each year since 1868, and it will be observed in the following table that the increase of each year has been a varying one:4 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. Proportion of males and females " remaining " on 1st January 1875. 11. Males formed 77.56 per cent. and females 22.43 per cent. of the total population " remaining " on the 1st January 1875. Admissions (re-admissions not included). 12. During 1875, 384 insane patients (males 305, females 79) were admitted into the several asylums. This number was considerably lower than that of 1874, and was also below the average of the preceding decennial period by 9 (males 2, females 7). The greatest number of admissions was into the Dullunda Asylum, in which they were at the rate of 50.37 per cent. of the mean strength, while into the asylums at Berhampore Cuttack, Patna, and Dacca, they were respectively 22.34, 35.48, 35.32, and 30.00. There were no admissions into the Moydapore institution during the year. Proportion of the sexes in the admissions. 13.

During 1875 the total number of cases of sickness treated in the asylum hospitals amounted to 1,209 (males 990, females 219). This was at the rate of 107.32 per cent. of mean strength, or at the rate of 113.06 per cent. of males and 87.30 per cent. of females on mean strength of each sex. Daily average sick. 39. The daily average number of sick was 84.45 (males 67.90, females 16.55), or at the rate of 7.48 per cent. (males 6.02, females 1.46) of mean strength. This sick rate was very slightly in excess of that of the average of the preceding five years. Principal diseases causing sickness. 40.

To effect this it is not necessary to place the inmates under the influence of draughts, or to expose them to the vicissitudes of a cold outside temperature. It is well known that exposure to draughts of wind of a certain velocity and temperature, and to cold, cannot be borne with impunity except under very special circumstances, and much less could such exposure be endured by a class of persons whose constitutions are more or less debilitated, not only as a result of their mental aberration, but very possibly also as a result of their previous necessitous circum- stances. Fresh air, and plenty of it, is one of the great essentials for the preservation of good health; but if admitted with too great a velocity, and of too low a temperature, it then becomes dangerousLUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 11 Population on 1st January and 31st December. The year opened with a population of 213 (males 188, females 25) criminal lunatics, and closed with one of 232 (males 207, females 25), or an increase of 9 males. Mean strength. The mean strength of this class was 224.24 (males 198.77, females 25.47), and formed nearly 20 per cent. of the mean asylum population of the year. Statistics of criminal and non-criminal lunatics.

DULLUNDA ASYLUM. Superintendence. REMARKS ON THE SEVERAL ASYLUMS. 62. Dullunda.LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 13 Prevalence of bowel complaints. 73. Bowel complaints (including cholera) caused more than half the admissions of the male patients, and nearly half of the admissions into hospital of the female patients. Mortality. 74. During the year 49 patients (males 32, females 17) died. The mortality was at the rate of 13.39 per cent. of males and 24.00 per cent. of females on average daily strength of each sex, and at the rate of 18.39 per cent. of males and 32.69 per cent. of females on the total number treated in hospital. 75. The principal diseases in order of fatality, and their rates per cent. of the total deaths of each sex, are shown in the following table :14 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. Management. 87. The system of management is the same which has been given in full detail in former reports. Industrial employment has been successfully pursued, and out of a mean population of 309 persons 263 were constantly engaged in some form of industry during 1875. Establishment. 88. The Superintendent reports in the most commendatory terms on the attention energy, and zeal with which the deputy superintendent, the matron, the hospital assistant, and the darogah, have discharged their duties during the year. Report by the Deputy Surgeon- General of the Presidency Circle. 89. The Deputy Surgeon-General of the Presidency Circle, who is also an official visitor of the asylum, reports that " the patients are kindly and judiciously treated; their diet is sufficient in quantity, and variety, of good quality, and well-cooked; clothing good, sufficient, and suited to the season; conservancy very carefully attended to: in short, the management in every detail is everything that could be desired, and an example of how such an institution should be conducted.'' These most satisfactory remarks on the efficient administration of the asylum, and on the care bestowed on the patients, are highly creditable to all concerned, and are fully corroborated by the reports of former years. Average cost per head. 90. The average cost of each lunatic during the year was Rs. 138-0-8 for the several items of establishment, diet, clothing, contingencies, bazar medicines, &c. Amount received from paying- patients. 91. Rs. 2,647-3-6 were received on account of paying-patients in the asylum, and this sum is greatly in excess of the amounts received in 1874 and 1873. Explanation of high average cost per patient. 92. In comparison with other asylums the average cost of each lunatic is high, but in explanation the Superintendent states that the Dullunda Asylum is debited with half the full pay of a Surgeon-Major instead of the small sum added to the Civil Surgeon's salary in provincial asylums ; and again, that the charge for gas alone (Rs. 1,783 in 1875) raises the contingencies above those of places where such means of lighting are not to be had. DACCA ASYLUM. 93. Dacca.LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 15 there was a fair proportion of patients who had improved mentally, and who, during the last six months of the year, might have been discharged cured. In this way, the Superin- tendent adds, the asylum statistics were greatly influenced as to mortality, sick-rate, and mental cures. Transferred. 101. There were but five patients (males 4, females 1) transferred to their friends in an improved condition. Discharged "otherwise." 102. Of the 58 patients (males 57, females 1) discharged " otherwise," 50 were trans- ferred to Berhampore Asylum, four escaped (three of whom were criminal lunatics), and four were boarded out. Sickness. 103. The total number treated in hospital during 1875 was 596 (males 501, females 95), or at the rate per cent. of average strength for males 251.75, and females 188.11. Daily average number of sick. 104. The daily average number of sick was 41.40 (males 33.61, females 7.79), or at the rate per cent. of average strength for males 16.88, and for females 15.42, and was greatly in excess of the daily average sick of any year of the preceding decennial period. Principal diseases causing sickness. 105. The diseases which caused the greatest amount of sickness according to sex, and their proportion to the total number treated, are shewn in the following table:16 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. during the cold and rainy months, as both may be attended by disastrous results. The Deputy Surgeon-General (Dr. Bow) writes as follows:LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 17 Construction of new cells delayed. 127. The construction of a new range of cells has been sanctioned by His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor, and will be carried out at a cost not exceeding Rs. 21,500. The Superintendent states that the order for its being " put in hand at once " was dated 30th July 1875, but as yet nothing has been done, although several references have been made on the subject to the Department of Public Works. This new building will consist of 20 cells capable of accommodating 40 lunatics, two in each cell, on the plan of the present female ward. Dining-shed. 128. The dining-shed has been completed, and the Superintendent remarks that it will be found very useful during the rains. Conservancy. 129. The general conservancy of the asylum is stated to have been considerably improved during the year. Three new privies have been constructed, and the dry-earth system is carefully carried out in them. The night-soil is buried in shallow trenches in the garden. Water-supply. 130. Water brought from the river and filtered was still used by the lunatics, but it is hoped that an extension of the new water-supply for Dacca will be brought into the asylum. Total cost of each patient. 131. The total cost of each patient was Rs. 107-2-8, against Rs. 108-4-6 in 1874. Cost of dieting. 132. The cost of dieting each patient during 1875 was Rs. 57-7-9; but this sum, though less than that of 1874, is considerably in excess of the amount expended during 1871, 1872, and 1873 on the same account. Sum received for patients treated in the asylum. 133. A sum of Rs. 940-7-9 was received for the maintenance of insane patients treated in the asylum during 1875. This shows a considerable and very satisfactory increase on the receipts of former years under this head. Manufactures, account of. 134. The total sum received on account of manufactures during 1875 was Rs. 6,819-3-5, and the total expenditure amounted to Rs. 3,321-14-9, so that the net profit accruing to the asylum from the industry of its insane population was the sum of Rs. 3,497-4-8. 135. Dr. Smith reports favourably of Mr. Camelleri and Prosono Coomar Sein, the native doctor, and would be glad to see the pay of the latter increased. Visited by Miss Mary Carpenter. 136. The asylum was visited on the 23rd December 1875 by Miss Mary Carpenter, of Bristol, England. She found the patients carefully employed on the grounds and in various industries, and they would not generally give an impression of being insane. " This institution," she writes, " is a striking example of the power of good principles well developed, and of the moral influence won over the insane by a man of loving heart and devoted spirit, such as appeared to animate the Superintendent." Inspected by the Deputy Surgeon- General, Dacca Circle, on 9th November 1875. 137. The asylum was inspected by the Deputy Surgeon-General of the Dacca Circle on the 9th November 1875. On the day of his inspection, there were 58 males and 4 females in excess of the regulated number of patients for whom there was accommodation, calculated at the rate of 50 superficial feet for each one. Everything in the asylum was very neat and clean, the medicines, &c., were all in good order, and the records correctly kept up to date. The Deputy Surgeon-General remarks in the visitors' book that but little harm would result from the overcrowding, provided the ventilation of the different wards was not interfered with. PATNA ASYLUM. 138. Patna.18 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. population was in excess of the average male population of the preceding five years by 54, while on the same date the number of females in the asylum was 9 below the average of the same period. Admitted. 141. During the year 89 insane patients (males 69, females 20) were admitted, and the number of admissions of male patients was below the average of the five preceding years by 9, while the female admissions were in excess of the average by 4. Re-admitted. 142. But five persons were re-admitted (males 4, female 1), and this number was consi- derably under the average of the preceding quinquennial period. All the patients who were re-admitted were addicted to habits of intemperance or were ganja-smokers. State of health of those admitted. 143. Sixty-nine of the patients admitted were in a bad or indifferent state of health, and were chiefly suffering from chest or bowel complaints. Total population. 144. The total asylum population for the year was 360 (males 297, females 63), while the average total population for the preceding five years was 326 (males 256, females 70), so that there was an increase on this average in 1875 of 41 males and a decrease of 7 females. Daily average strength. 145. The daily average strength of the asylum population was 252 (males 202, females 50), and this number was slightly in excess of the average of the four previous years. Discharged "cured." 146. There were 34 patients (males 30, females 4) discharged cured, or at the rate of 14.85 per cent. of males and 8.00 per cent. of females on the average strength of each sex. Transferred. 147. Five male patients were transferred to the care of their friends as improved, and 50 males were transferred to the Berhampore Asylum. Capacity of asylum. Overcrowding of male patients. 148. The capacity of this asylum, calculated at 50 superficial feet per patient, is for 151 men, 70 women, and 39 criminal lunatics, so that, taking the mean average strength of the year as the standard for observation, it will be noticed that the male patients were in excess of the proper number by 51, while the females had plenty of accommodation. There was overcrowding of the criminal population to a slight extent. Total number of sick. 149. The total number of sick in hospital during the year was 146 (males 126, females 20), or at the rate per cent. of daily average strength of each classLUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 19 Population "remaining" on 31st December. 156. The residual population on the 31st December 1875 was 254 (males 196, females 58), and it will be observed that this number is less than that shown as remaining in the asylum on the 1st of January by males 101 and females 5. This decrease is, however, mainly due to the transfer of 50 male patients to the Berhampore Asylum. Criminal lunatics. 157. The population of criminal lunatics in the asylum on the 1st January 1875 was 38 (males 34, females 4). The strength of the males of this class was, on this date, four in excess of the average male population of the preceding five years, while the strength of the females was the same. 158. Fourteen (males 12, females 2) were admitted, and the total criminal population of the year was 52 (males 46, females 6). Proportion of criminal lunatics to asylum population. 159. The proportion of criminal lunatics to the total asylum population was 15.48 per cent. of males and 9.52 per cent. of females. 160. Five criminal lunatics (male) were discharged, and 1 male died. 161. On the 31st of December the residual population of criminal lunatics was 46 (males 40, females 6), or, on that date, at the rate of 20.40 per cent. of males and 10.3 per cent. of females to the total asylum population. Receipts for maintenance of patients. 162. Only Rs. 124 were received on account of the maintenance of patients in the asylum during the year; but this sum, though a small one, was an increase of Rs. 100 on the amount received in 1874. It seems, too, that there was a great difficulty in collecting this money, and it was done solely through the agency of the asylum authorities. The superintende ent suggests that the committing officer, in all cases where the friends of patients are abl- to pay for their support in the asylum, should see that the money is collected and forwarded to him (the Superintendent), to be lodged in the treasury to the credit of Government. Advantage of having the water raised by pumps. 163. At the suggestion of Dr. Irving, the Deputy Surgeon-General of the Dinapore Circle, the Officiating Commissioner made over eight pumps for asylum use. These pumps were erected over all the wells but one, and are said to be of the greatest use for washing and irrigation purposes, as they are each capable of raising upwards of 800 gallons of water per hour. However, they prove of additional value in preserving the water from defilement, and in preventing accidents from people falling into the wells. One well has been kept open for drinking purposes, as the servants object to use water which has come in contact with the leather suckers of the pumps. Cost of keep of each patient. 164. The cost of each patient was Rs. 74-0-3, against Rs. 94-8-3 in 1874. The saving was principally effected under the head of diet. Manufactures. 165. The manufactures are principally confined to the preparation of castor-oil, blankets, durries, and table-covers, and a considerable number of patients have been employed on them. The profit on the sale of the manufactured articles amounted to Rs. 1,005-5-8½. BERHAMPORE ASYLUM. Superintendent. 166. Berhampore.20 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. Principal diseases. 173. The principal diseases in order of frequency, and their rate per cent. to the total treated in hospital and according to sex, were as follow :LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 21 Employment. 185. On the average, 71 males and 41 females were usefully and healthfully employed daily during the year in oil manufacture, the weaving of cloth and gunny, spinning cotton and jute, &c., &c. The total amount realized from the sale of manufactured articles was Rs. 1,908-7-11, of which the sum of Rs. 755-7-7 was profit. 186. The Superintendent reports well of his subordinate asylum staff.

CALCUTTA, THE 13TH JANUARY 1877. RESOLUTION. READ( 2 ) 1875. 1874. Admitted ... ... 418 601 Discharged ... ... 218 290 Died ... ... 127 140 against 1,334 in the previous year. The daily average number of insanes under restraint was similarly 1126.4 against 1050.86 in the previous year, and 906.6 on an average of the five years preceding. As compared with the previous year, the number of admissions, discharges, and deaths were as shewn in the margin. On the last day of 1875 there were 906 males and 241 females in confinement, against 833 males and 241 females at the close of the previous year. Since 1868 there has been a steady and progressive increase in the asylum population remaining at the close of each year. The total increase of 73 in the number of insanes under treatment at the close of 1875, as shewn above, is somewhat in excess of the average annual increment which, as noticed by the Surgeon-General, has amounted to 62.5 during the past eight years. No explanation can be given of the fluctuations which are observable in the figures of the several years. 6. Taking the asylums separately, the general results of the past year may be summarised thus( 3 ) 10. The following table shews the rate of mortality in the asylums of the Lower Provinces during two years, in contrast with the results observed in other provinces:( 4 ) 15. The total expenditure on all asylums during the year under review is reported to have been Rs. 1,16,019 against Rs. 1,16,474 in the previous year. There has been an improvement, as shewn in the margin, in the amount of receipts realized from the friends and relatives of insanes for their main- tenance, as well as in the profits derived from the manufactures carried on at the asylums. The result has been that the average nett cost of each patient has been reduced from Rs. 99-7-8 to Rs. 86-11-7, which is satisfactory. 1875. 1874. Rs. Rs. Realized from the friends of patients. 3,712 1,686 Actual profit from manufactures. 14,619 10,225 16. As regards the management of individual asylums, there is nothing in the report calling for special remark. The attention of Superintendents should be specially called to the table given at paragraph 57 of the report, shewing the comparative cost of each patient under the several heads of charge at each of the asylums. Recent revelations at Dacca in some measure account for the excessive charge under the head of " Diet." The differences in the average cost of each patient under the several heads in the different asylums has not been explained. The matter, however, seems to call for enquiry, and should be investigated. 17. At the Bhowanipore Asylum for Europeans, the total number of patients treated during the year under review was 71 against 60 in the previous year. Of the whole number, 6 only were discharged as cured, 23 were transferred to their friends as improved, and 12 were sent to Europe. The Lieutenant-Governor is glad to observe the high testimony borne by the Deputy Surgeon-General to the kind and judicious manner in which insanes in this asylum are treated. Dr. Payne continues to merit the high reputation which he has so long borne for the management of this and the neighbouring institution at Dullunda. 18. Reviewing the results of the year generally, the Surgeon-General remarks that they could hardly have afforded more positive evidence of the favourable conditions in which the insanes under treatment have been placed, whether for the cure of their mental derangement by skilled attention to every detail, or in lessening the hardships of their sad lot by gentleness and kindness. The Lieutenant-Governor believes that Dr. Beatson's inference is perfectly warranted, and he fully appreciates the labours of the Superintendents who have had charge of the asylums during the year under report.
