PREFACE : GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. 1. I held combined charge of the Bengal Veterinary College and the Provincial Civil Veterinary Department for the year 1907-1908. Most of the departmental work was conducted, under my control and direction, conjointly by the two Imperial Officers under training, Mr. D. Quinlan and Mr. W. Harris, from 1st April to 28th May, and singly by Mr. Quinlan from 29th May to 31st March. Mr. Quinlan spent 186 days on tour and travelled 795 miles by road and 14,099 miles by rail. He attended outbreaks of disease in districts, inspected hospitals and dispensaries, visited cattle farms and judged at horse and cattle shows. He made special tours in Bihar and in the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh in connexion with cattle breeding. The relief from my touring work gave me a very good opportunity to start the glanders work in Calcutta and to personally supervise it, Mr. Quinlan, who is a zealous officer, has also brought out a useful Note on the Breeds of Darjeeling Cattle. The sanction of Government to the separation of the offices of the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bengal, and the Principal of the Bengal Veterinary College, with effect from 1st April 1908 has been given. Mr. D. Quinlan is placed in charge of the department and I in charge of the College, as well as in departmental charge of the area under the Glanders and Farcy Act in Calcutta. The general control over promotion and posting is vested in me. I.( 2 ) The following officers served on the Board of Examiners: ( 3 ) The Laboratory was built originally for the cool storage of serum and to assist by up-to-date methods the diagnosis of obscure cases admitted in the ordinary way to the college hospital. But the sphere of work has extended in various directions. Thus, besides the routine cases from the hospital, material comes in connected with the Glanders and Farcy Act: the recent severe outbreak of rabies amongst the dogs in Calcutta gave us an oppor- tunity of making ourselves useful to the public by diagnosing these cases quickly: at the request of the Agricultural Inspector of the New Zealand Government, which is much interested in the bone-meal trade of Calcutta, I have undertaken to make bacteriological examinations of the samples which he collects from the mills and have also visited the mills engaged in the trade: a difficult subject connected with the flaying of live goats has been under consideration of Government, and it is hoped that a note on the subject with photographs submitted from this laboratory may help to settle the question: an investigation into the cause of a disease amongst certain cattle in Calcutta has been in progress since July (this disease has not hitherto been observed in India): some preliminary work has been done in regard to surra amongst animals in Calcutta, with the object of obtaining a remedy of practical value. We have endeavoured also to assist other investigators when called on; for instance, we have undertaken to cultivate and forward to the Imperial Bacterio- logist fresh supplies of the bacillus of glanders, which is so necessary for the preparation of efficient mallein, and we shall always be glad to hold ourselves at his disposal in this and other matters: an assistant whom the Imperial Entomo- logist had sent to this laboratory to work has been welcomed and he has been able to secure good specimens of the biting flies which are such important agents in the spread of disease. It may be added that collecting boxes were distributed to the Veterinary Assistants in the districts, and a number of them filled with flies have been sent to Pusa. It must, however, be confessed that our men have not yet reached perfection in mounting these objects: from the Zoological Gardens we have received for report the bodies of various animals that died during the year of obscure disease. I beg to thank the Committee for sending them. My old pupil, Babu Satyendra Nath Mitter, the present lecturer on Patho- logy, has rendered zealous assistance in the laboratory, and also Babu Sachindra Kishore Das has done good work in preparing specimens. They are both keen workers. His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor has been pleased to order that my name shall be connected with the Research Laboratory. I would beg to express my earnest thanks for his kindness. 12. The Glanders and Farcy Department.( 4 ) The equine population in the six glanders districts has been estimated at 10,985. Two thousand nine hundred and twenty-four stables were inspected; glanders was detected in 58. The total number of horses admitted into the Contagious Diseases Hospital was 120. Of these, 72 were fully developed cases of glanders, 3 proved to be cases of Epizootic Lymphangitis, 2, which died in the hospital, were found to be suffering from other diseases not coming under the Act, 35 were discharged as free from glanders and eight were under observation. From April to October, during which period the Remount Dep6t remained closed, 1,400 horses were inspected by the glanders staff on boardship in the Hooghly and none showed clinical symptions of the disease. Anti-rinderpest inoculation in Calcutta has been added to the work of the glanders staff. 13. The Public Works Department work on the college buildings.( 5 ) Rs. 10,000. Notwithstanding the efforts of the Chairman of the Khulna District Board, the Veterinary Dispensary had to close from lack of support. Patna has not yet been provided with a properly equipped hospital; the present building is most unsuitable and insanitary; the Veterinary Assistant's quarters are unsafe. The district Board of Murshidabad, considering the number of horses in the district, have not yet made any effort to establish a hospital. The Dispensaries at Gaya, Purulia, Bankipore, Purnea, Palamau, Sambalpur and Monghyr, have treated a large number of cases, while the popularity of the others is rapidly extending. The Itinerating Veterinary Assistant at Angul has been provided with a room for his medicines and instru- ments. Shoeing forges have been established at Bhagalpur, Purnea, Ranchi, Purulia, Cuttack and Burdwan. The nalband at Bhagulpore was trained at Belgachia. The dispensary at Purulia has been removed to a more suitable site during the year, ana a new dispensary building with Veterinary Assistant's quarters has been constructed. A new building with Assistant's quarters has been provided for the Sambalpur Dispensary also. A comparison with the previous year's figures will show that there has been a steady increase in the number of patients treated at almost all dispensaries. The large decrease noticed against Dumraon is due to a mistake made in reporting the previous year's figures. The decrease against Bankipore is large, but the figures show an honest year's work. The work of the Veterinary Assistant at Dumka during the year under report is under enquiry. It is not satisfactory. III.-BREEDING OPERATIONS. (1) Bovines. 18.
