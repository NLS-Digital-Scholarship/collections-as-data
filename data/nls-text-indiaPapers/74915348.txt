BULLETIN OF THE PASTEUR INSTITUTE OF SOUTHERN INDIA. SECTION I.2 injected into the abdominal subcutaneous tissue of 3 or 4 other guinea pigs. A similar procedure was adopted to continue the series, whenever one of the guinea pigs developed rabies. Series 1 failed after the fourth salivary gland passage, Series 2 after the fourth passage, and Series 3 after the fifth passage. Each series, however, probably could have been kept going indefinitely if only a large enough number of sub-inoculations could .have been made. Nevertheless the results obtained seem to be sufficiently consistent to point the distinction between virus derived from the central nervous system on the one hand and from the salivary glands on the other. Out of 44 guinea pigs subcutaneously inoculated with emulsion of street virus salivary glands, 20 developed rabies, and all the 20 showed numerous Negri bodies varying from 5µ to 20µ in diameter: a marked contrast with the guinea pigs mentioned above which had been inoculated with brain matter. It is more difficult to secure infection in guinea pigs with salivary gland emul- sion subcutaneously than with brain matter subcutaneously, a fact which other workers have noticed in dealing with dogs' salivary glands. In addition to a higher rate of infectivity brain matter has a shorter incubation period than salivary gland emulsion. The average incubation period of the 31 guinea pigs inoculated with brain matter was 16.9 days and that of the 20 inoculated with salivary gland matter was 20.7 days. We are now attempting to re-construct the Negri bodies of street virus from ordinary fixed virus by using the salivary glands of guinea pigs which have died from subcutaneous fixed virus infection. It is much more difficult, however, to obtain infection through the medium of fixed virus salivary glands than with street virus glands. 2.3 Number of passage. Incubation period.

The series was discontinued after the seventy-fourth passage as no further informa tion could be expected from it. 3.&#8212;On Lentz's Passage wutkörper. Lentz (Zeit. für Hygiene LXII, 1908) in 1908 described certain microscopic appearances under the name of passagewutkörper which he stated to be always present in passage rabies, i.e., fixed virus, and absent in street virus and other affections. The bodies were to be found almost exclusively in the central third of the semi- circle of large ganglionic nerve cells displayed in cross sections of the hippocampus major, and were to be recognised only after the Eosin-Methylene-blue method of staining employed by Lentz, not after Mann's stain. They have no relation therefore to Negri bodies. As it is highly important to be in possession of a means of recog- nising sections of fixed virus hippocampus unfailingly under the microscope we at once proceeded to verify Lentz's discovery, following his method with exactitude, but we failed to find the passagewutkörper in several of the fixed virus Hippocampi examined. In some brains the passagewutkörper were numerous and well marked, in others scanty, and in a few none at all could be demonstrated. We could not find any in street virus brains, Lentz also having observed this.

It seems evident that, when dealing with the strain of fixed virus of this Institute at any rate, one cannot depend on Lentz's method for its recognition under the micros- cope. The objects he describes seem to us to be degenerated nerve cells whose cytoplasm has taken on an acidophile re-action, and whose nuclear matter has broken up into basophile globules of varying number and size. Doubtless these passagewutkörper are in some way dependent on the presence of the rabic organism in the brain, but they are not constantly found, and Pinzani (Cent. für Bakt. Orig. LI, 1909) has recently shown that they are not even specific, as he has observed them in other morbid states of the brain besides fixed virus rabies. Kozewaloff (Cent. für Bakt. Orig. LII, 1909) also concludes that they are not of a parasitic nature.
5 SECTION II.&#8212;ON THE INFECTIVITY OF FIXED VIRUS. 1.&#8212;To ascertain in what manner the infectivity of fixed virus diminishes when preserved in glycerine. The spinal cords of fixed virus rabbits were divided into numerous pieces, each of which was carefully weighed. The alternate pieces were preserved in the ice box immersed in the three following fluids:6 The figures show that there is undoubted diminution of virulence due to the action of glycerine, whether pure or diluted with salt solution: but no relation between the length of time the material was kept and its virulence is apparent. The chief point brought out is the much greater proportion of infections obtained with the material preserved in 50 per cent. glycerine than with that preserved in pure glycerine (80 per cent. against 46 per cent.), 25 per cent. glycerine, however, seems to be a worse medium than 50 per cent. glycerine, giving an infection rate of 56 per cent. though this number is based on fewer figures. The average incubation period is in conformity, being 7.7 days for the material prescribed in 50 per cent. glycerine, 9.3 days for pure glycerine and 12 days for 25 per cent. glycerine. The conclusions to be drawn are7 1 survived 12 weeks and succumbed 40 days after intraocular injection with street virus. (No Negri bodies, sub-inoculation in guinea pig negative.) 2 survived 12 weeks and succumbed two months after subcutaneous inoculation with street virus. (No Negri bodies, sub-inoculation in guinea pigs negative.) (5) Of 10 monkeys, inoculated daily for 14 days subcutaneously in abdomen with fresh fixed virus brain substance from rabbits, 1/1,000 of the body weight being injected altogether8 The following table shows the effect of each of these three strains as regards the length of the incubation period and the duration of the disease when inoculated subdurally:9 and 181 is therefore no proof that they did not die from the street virus infection and the fact that Negri bodies were recovered in a sub-passage from No. 115 makes it clear that that animal at least died from street virus infection. Sub-passages were not made from No. 84 and No. 181, so, it remains uncertain whether they succumbed to street virus or fixed virus infection. (2) Six other guinea pigs were inoculated subcutaneously in the back with first passage street virus brain. On the next day protective subcutaneous injections with fixed virus were begun. In all fourteen injections, amounting to 1/10,000 of the animal's weight of fresh fixed virus were given in the abdomen at a distance from the street virus infection unless death occurred before the end. One of the six survived. Of the remaining five10 The two guinea pigs having been killed on the sixth day after the inoculation had shown, as is only natural, no symptoms of rabies. It is, therefore, possible that they would not have succumbed to rabies if they had been allowed to live longer and that the absence of infective matter in the nodules was due to the inherent protective power of their tissues which had destroyed the virus. This possibility is excluded in the case of the rabbit which actually died of rabies, and the fact lends support to the view that it is the virus which is rapidly dissemi- nated throughout the body, until some of it finds a suitable location in the central nervous system, which is the real starting point of the disease. The peculiar assemblage of eosinophile cells at the point of inoculation is noteworthy. 6.11 SECTION III.12 The following results were obtained:13 Goat B had two more kids on 5th January 1909. The serum of one of these kids was tested against 0.05 cc. sheep erythrocytes at intervals with the following results:&#8212; Kid 7 days old 7.5 percent. serum complete lysis. ,, 35 ,, 7.5 ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, 63 ,, 12.0 ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, 91 ,, 32.0 ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, 126 ,, 82.0 ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, 147 ,, 100.0 ,, ,, slight ,, ,, 182 ,, 100.0 ,, ,, no ,, The serum of this kid, born on 5th January 1909, contained more lysin than that of the first, born on 10th July 1908, probably because goat B had received several more injections of sheep erythrocytes in the interval, but it all disappeared within approximately the same period. To ascertain whether the lysin is conveyed by the mother's milk or by the placental blood experiments were made with another goat, goat A. Goat A had two kids on 10th July 1908. The serum neither of goat A nor of her two kids lysed sheep erythrocytes. Goat A then received injections of sheep erythrocytes. On 26th July 1908, 8 per cent. of goat A's serum lysed 0.05 cc. sheep erythro- cytes completely. While her serum contained lysin for sheep erythrocytes she was suckling her kids, but no lysis could be obtained with the serum of either kid; so it appears that a specific lysin is conveyed to offspring by placental blood and not by milk. 4,&#8212;To find if there is much variation from day to day in the resistance of the erythrocytes of a healthy animal to lysis by hypotonic solutions of sodium chloride. The erythrocytes of a normal goat were tested daily for 14 days. Method. &#8212;The blood was received into a solution containing 1 per cent. sodium citrate and .85 per cent. sodium chloride, centrifugated and washed twice in .85 per cent. salt. A series of test tubes was prepared containing gradated percentages of salt, 2.5 cc. in each, the difference between any two adjacent tubes being equivalent to .017 per cent. NaCl. Into each tube was inserted by a calibrated pipette .05 cc. of the washed erythrocytes which were well distributed by immediate shaking. The tubes were afterwards shaken up at intervals, left at room temperature for an hour and then kept in the ice chest till next morning, when the degree of the lysis was judged.

It appears therefore that the daily variations of the resistance of the erythrocytes of a healthy animal to lysis by hypotonic salt solution are very small. 4

The range between the first noticeable "trace" of lysis and "complete" lysis seems to remain about the same; that is to say, as far as can be judged by this some- what rough visual method, if on any particular day there are more erythrocytes in the circulation which are less resistant to the highest percentages of salt employed there are also fewer which are resistant to the lowest percentages of salt employed. The range between the "trace" and "complete" points appears to be much the same in all the species of animals so far tested, though each species occupies a definite position on the percentage scale, but into this matter we hope to enter more fully in a subsequent issue. Suffice it to say at present that the vast majority of the erythrocytes of any healthy animal are lysed completely by lowering the tonicity of the suspending fluid to a certain point; that comparatively few are more resistant or less resistant than the majority; that variations from the mean are measured by actually small differences in the tonicity of the suspending fluid and that the fluctuations in resistance from day to day seem to effect the whole number of the erythrocytes. There appears to be no obvious relation between the fluctuations in resistance of the erythrocytes and the percentage of chlorides present in the serum. ( Vide chart 1.) We have not touched upon variations in resistance resulting from disease but a careful experiment made by dieting two puppies seems to show that, as long as no actual organic disease is engendered, unsuitable diet carried nearly to the extent of arrest of growth has no influence on the resistance of the erythrocytes. Two healthy puppies, 3 months old, from the same litter were selected and the lytic points of their erythrocytes determined. One was then fed on an exclusively meat diet, the other on an exclusively vegetable diet. During the period of the experiment "Meat" increased in weight by 66 per cent. while "Vegetable" only increased by 5 per cent. After 21 days dieting the lytic points of the erythrocytes of both animals were precisely the same as they were before the dieting began. After 32 days there was a slight fall in resistance in both animals but it was the same for each. Before dieting. After 21 days. After 32 days.

It may be concluded, therefore, that the serum of an ill-nourished but otherwise healthy animal may be expected to contain as much lysin as that of a well nourished animal and that the erythrocytes of healthy animals of the same species will not be found to vary as regards their lytic points beyond the normal range as a consqeuence of poor feeding.

To determine whether the very marked difference between defibrinated and citrated bloods was due merely to the increase of tonicity consequent on the presence of 1 per cent. sodium citrate in the latter further experiments were made. (a) On the inhibitory power of hypertonic solutions on lysis. In a preliminary estimation it was found that the tonicity of a sheep serum was equivalent to 1 per cent. NaCl. By the addition of measured weights of dry NaCl the tonicities of three other quantities of this serum were raised to 1.2 per cent., 1.4 per cent. and 1.6 per cent. NaCl, respectively, when tested with 0.05 cc. rabbit R.B.Cs. Serum A (tonicity 1.0 per cent. NaCl ) 0.65 cc. gave Complete lysis. " B ( " 1.2 " " ) 1.05 " " " " C ( " 1.4 " " ) 1.25 " " " " D ( " 1.6 " " ) 1.65 " " " So it is evident that a comparatively small increase in tonicity has a pronounced influence in the direction of hindering lysis. (b) On the relation between the tonicities of sodium chloride and sodium citrate. Using any R.B.Cs. as indicator, it proved that approximately three times as much sodium citrate by weight was required to prevent lysis by hypotonic solutions as was required of sodium chloride. As long as this relation of 3 citrate to 1 chloride is borne in mind, solutions of any desired tonicity containing a mixture of the two salts in due proportions can be prepared. Thus 1 gramme sodium chloride plus 3 grammes sodium citrate dissolved in 100 cc. water is equivalent in tonicity to a 2 per cent. solution of sodium chloride. It will be noticed under experiment(a) that the increased tonicity of the medium did not altogether abolish lysis even up to 1.6 per cent. NaCl but that an increased quantity of serum was required to accomplish it. In fact in the presence of 1.6 percent. NaCl, 2.6 times as much serum was required to give complete lysis as was required in its absence. In table 1, it may be further noticed that 1.95 cc. of citrated blood with a tonicity of 1.6 per cent. NaCl failed to lyse completely the quantity of R.B.Cs. lysed by 0.35 cc. of defibrinated blood, i.e., that more than 5 parts of citrated blood failed to accomplish. the same degree of lysis as 1 part of defibrinated blood. Similarly, even when the tonicity was reduced to normal by dilution with 0.85 per cent. NaCl., 0.35 cc. citrated blood only produced slight lysis in contrast with the complete lysis produced by 0.35 cc. defibrinated blood. Likewise, in table 2, the tonicity of the citrated bloods used does not entirely account for the total absence or hindrance of lysis there displayed. It would appear then that citrate has some effect on blood in the way of hindering its lytic power quite apart from the tonicity of the solution. 5
18 A tonicity of 1.4 due to NaCl necessitates the use of just twice as much of the lytic serum to produce complete lysis as is required of the serum to which no NaCl has been added. In table 2 it is seen that, whereas 0.45 cc. defibrinated blood secured complete lysis, 1.05 cc. of citrated blood, more than twice as much, gave no lysis and the tonicity was equivalent to only 1.2 per cent. NaCl. In the other example given 0.2 cc. defibrinated blood secured complete lysis, while 1.25 cc. citrated blood, more than six times as much, gave incomplete lysis with a tonicity equivalent to only 1.3 per cent. NaCl. (c) On the effect of raising the tonicity of defibrinated blood to equal that of the citrated blood. The tonicities of rabbit citrated blood and defibrinated blood having been deter- mined in terms of NaCl by a preliminary experiment, the tonicity of the defibrinated blood was raised to that of the citrated by the addition of NaCl. Parallel series of tubes were then put up with the two, using goat R.B.Cs. as an indicator. The final tonicity of the two bloods was 1.63 per cent. NaCl. It was found that 0.3 cc. defibrinated blood completely dissolved 0.05 cc. goat R.B.Cs. and that 1.95 cc. of the citrated blood only partially dissolved a similar quantity. The experiment was repeated using goat blood and rabbit R.B.Cs. The final tonicity of the defibrinated and citrated bloods was 1.6 per cent. NaCl. Complete lysis was obtained by 0.35 cc. defibrinated blood and no lysis by 1.95 cc. citrated blood. (d) On the effect of lowering the tonicity of the citrated blood by dilution An experiment showed that 0.65 cc. citrated rabbit blood of a tonicity of 1.08 per cent. NaCl, and 1.95 cc. of a tonicity of 1.63 per cent. NaCl, gave an equal degree of lysis with goat R.B.Cs., proving that the lytic power of citrated blood can be to some extent, but only slightly, restored by lowering its tonicity by dilution. Rabbit R.B.Cs. obtained from (a) citrated, and (b) defibrinated blood and washed in the usual way were lysed by fresh sheep serum in exactly similar degrees, so citrate has no permanent alterative influence on the R.B.Cs. themselves. The inferences to be drawn from these experiments were either that the citrate precipitates some substance the presence of which in solution is essential for lysis, or that in the presence of citrate amboceptor and complement cannot combine with each other, or that amboceptor is not bound to the red cells. The next step was to ascertain whether the addition of citrate to blood after its defibrination by whipping still inhibited its lytic power. Several experiments united in showing that the addition of 1 per cent. citrate after defibrination causes con- siderable diminution of lysis but not to the same degree as when the citrate is added to the whole blood. This holds good whether rabbit blood is used with sheep R.B.Cs. or goat blood with rabbit R.B.Cs. Attempts were made to remove the citrate from citrated blood by precipitation with calcium chloride, but lysis instead of being restored was entirely abolished even when the tonicity of the solution was so far diminished by dilution as to render complete lysis possible. Other workers, however, have reported success in this experiment. Assuming for the sake of argument that the citrate precipitates something essential to lysis from the blood no adequate explanation offers itself of the fact that the citrate has greater inhibitory power when added to the whole blood than when added to previously defibrinated blood. It can only be suggested that defibrinated blood is richer in complement on account of the mechanical disintegration of a certain proportion of leucocytes in the process of whipping, a factor of disturbance which is absent from plasma obtained by citration. The fluid obtained after citration was always opalescent even after prolonged centrifugalisation whether the whole blood was used or whether the citrate was added after defibrination, whereas the plasma obtained by defibrination was clear. This opalescence may have been due to the precipitation of calcium citrate. It does not appear, however, if sodium citrate is added to clear serum after clotting in any proportion from 1 per cent. to 10 per cent.
19 Citrated blood also has a well marked agglutinating action on erythrocytes which is not found with the defibrinated blood. The next step was to analyse citrated blood as to the activity of its lytic components. (a) Amboceptor.20 7.1 per cent. G. 1.5 cc. plasma plus 3.75 cc. of 7.5 per cent. sodium citrate in 0.85 per cent. NaCl. H. 1.5 cc. plasma plus 3.5 cc. of 3 per cent. sodium chloride in 0.85 per cent. NaCl. 10.5 per cent. I. 2 cc. plasma, plus 3 cc. of 10 per cent. sodium citrate in 0.85 per cent. NaCI. J. 2 cc. plasma plus 3 cc. of 4 per cent. sodium chloride in 0.85 per cent. NaCl. The final solutions A to J have an equal content of amboceptor. 0.5 cc. of sheep erythrocytes were in each case sensitized in 5 cc. of mixture for 30 minutes at 37ºC, then washed, so that no citrate appeared in the tubes put up. Each tube contained 0.05 cc. erythrocytes and its total volume was made up to 2 cc. with 0.85 per cent. NaCl. 0.25 cc. fresh sheep serum sufficed in each series to produce complete lysis of the sensitized erythrocytes, so that it is clear that sensitization of the sheep erythrocytes resulted in all concentrations of sodium citrate up to 10.5 per cent. The presence of sodium citrate in a sensitizing mixture is no bar to complete sensitization. (b) Complement
