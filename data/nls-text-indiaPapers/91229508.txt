NOTES ON VACCINATION IN THE CENTRAL PROV- INCES AND BERAR FOR THE SEASON 1911-12. Area served by the Vaccina- tion Department and popula- tion. The area served by the Vaccination Department remained the same as in the previous year, i. e. 99,857 square miles of British Districts and 31, 168 square miles of Feudatory States. The population according to the census of 1911 was 16,033,310 (13,916,308 for the British Districts and 2,117,002 for the Feudatory States). Vaccination Establishment. 2. The total number of Assistant Superintendents of Vaccination2 of Saoner, Latchmanswami of Sironcha and K. D. Salpekar of Chanda. The amount of work per vaccinator varies enormously with the district, for instance, the average in Yeotmal is 3,160, whereas in Wardha it is only 1,324. This difference cannot be due to sparsity of population, travelling difficulties, etc., for in many instances jungly districts show high figures. There appears to be a personal equation, the significance of which is difficult to compute. Some Deputy Commissioners comment on unpopularity or rather on a want of tact on the part of vaccinators. However tactful a vaccinator may be, the assistance of Revenue and other influential officers is invaluable [as remarked by the Deputy Commissioner of Drug who writes: &quot; I think that vaccinators should endeavour to meet the Deputy Commissioner on tour, provided it will not hinder the progress of their work. Revenue officers can render them much assistance and short conversations put the Deputy Commissioner in possession of facts and information not to be culled from bare statistics ;&quot;] and the Deputy Commissioner, Nagpur, proposes, in consultation with the Civil Surgeon, to draw up some rules in this connection, viz., to co-ordinate the efforts of the vaccin- ator with assistance from Revenue officers. In the Feudatory States, 94,632 operations (82,697 primary and 11,935 re-vaccinations) were performed against 79,002 (75,329 primary and 3,673 re-vaccinations) in the preceding year. In Bastar State only was a satisfactory amount done but in the remaining States the work is not up to the mark on account most likely of lack of supervision. STATEMENT II. Finance. 5. The cost of the establishment increased during the year under almost all heads on account of the appointment of additional Assistant Superintendents, vaccinators and peons, and consequently the cost of each successful vaccination rose slightly from Re. 0-1-10 in 1910-11 to Re. 0-1-11, during the year under report. The only items which show less expenditure are &quot; travelling allowance &quot; and &quot; contingencies. &quot; In the former, the decrease was due to Civil Surgeons having done less touring on account of plague and, in the latter, there were no outstanding accounts for adjustment as was the case in 1910-11. STATEMENT III. Dispensary Vaccination. 6. Owing to the prevalence of small-pox in Nagpur and other places, Sub- Assistant Surgeons were ordered to vaccinate, some other medical officers and private practitioners also undertaking the work. The Sub-Assistant Surgeons in Nagpur, where the outbreak was severe, performed 904 primary and 1,151 re- vaccinations. In Betul, a few (18) were done by these men and in Chanda 42 are reported to have been done by the compounder at Allapilli. Other officers, or rather volunteers, did 235 primary and 969 re-vaccinations. In the Feudatory States, where vaccination by Sub-Assistant Surgeons is still continued, 4,058 primary and 386 re-vaccinations were done, which is less than in the previous year. Inspection of Vaccination. 7. Civil Surgeons were 512 days out on tour and inspected 3,221 villages against 5,919 villages in 731 days in 1910-11, the number of operations inspected being 44,330 primary and 6,233 re-vaccinations against 69,066 and 11,479, respectively, in the preceding year. The prevalence of plague and the carrying out of inspections from village to village account for the low number of inspections. In some districts, however, the old procedure of collecting children at certain centres is still fol- lowed, e. g., Jubbulpore, where in five days as many as 112 villages were in- spected, giving an average of 22 villages per day, which shows that children from distant villages must have been collected. This system defeats the object of an inspection as explained in previous reports and should be avoided. Inpec- tions by Civil Surgeons, which should be mostly of a surprise nature, should be carried out as near the village as possible so that unsuccessful and exempted cases may also be seen. It often happens that in larger districts Civil Surgeons cannot devote much of their time to such inspection work, and even in smaller districts, as remarked by the Deputy Commissioner, Seoni, out-lying tracts are rarely inspected, but, under such circumstances, a Civil Surgeon should depute his Assistant Surgeon to assist in carrying out the more important inspections, taking care to examine his results and see that the work is progressing satisfactorily. It is quite true that the amount of skill required for this
3 work is not great, but what is absolutely necessary is reliability, so the Civil Surgeon's services cannot be wholly dispensed with, and several instances have lately come to notice where the withdrawal of this trustworthy supervision has been fraught with most undesirable consequences. Assistant Superintendents of Vaccination were out on tour for 3,784 days against 3,585 days in the previous year and inspected 253,796 primary and 24,710 re-vaccinations in 18,815 villages against 260,254 primary and 22,535 re-vaccina- tions in 20,302 villages in the year 1910-11. The prevalence of plague and discontinuance of the practice of collecting children for inspection accounts no doubt for the fall in the inspections, but in some districts the amount of touring done by these men is quite unsatisfactory and must be considerably increased. For instance, in Narsinghpur the Assistant Superintendent was out on tour for only 87 days during the season and for only 65 days in 1910-11. His case as well as those of Nagpur and Betul require explanation. These men seem to have spent much of their time at head-quarters without going out on inspection duty. As a rule, every Assistant Superintendent ought to spend at least 135 days (from 1st November to 15th March) in every season on inspection tours and Civil Surgeons should see that time is not wasted at head-quarters but that Assistant Superintendents make out definite programmes, carry them out and inspect as large a percentage of the total work done as possible. Mr. Napier suggests the appointment of an additional Assistant Superintendent for Drug. This case as well as that of Amraoti will be considered. Percentage of success. 8. The percentage of success in primary vaccinations recorded by vaccinators was 99.02 against 98.50 and 98.25 found on inspection by Civil Surgeons and Assistant and Superintendents. In none of the districts have the vaccinators claimed a cent per cent success and this is due to taking into account secondary or repeated operations, which, until recently, were ignored. In re-vaccination the success recorded was 75.12 per cent, while the Civil Surgeons and Assistant Superintendents found 53.79 and 54.40. In the Feudatory States 98.19 per cent of primary vaccinations are reported successful. The figure 98.10 per cent representing the re-vaccination results is certainly not to be accepted as Civil Surgeons, at their inspections, found only 79.99 for the former and 59.37 for the latter and other inspecting officers found 86.40 and 65.67 only. Lack of supervision is the cause of such unsatisfactory work in the States. Inspection by the Sanitary Commissioner. 9. In many of the towns vaccination work was so disorganized by plague that it was impossible to form any opinion of how it was progressing. In twelve of the principal ones, however, an average of 20 per cent of the total work done was examined and there can be no doubt that although in a few towns (Bhandara, Raipur, Burhanpur) the work is carefully and well done, in the majority there is much room for improvement. The commonest defects are lack of system in keeping registers and issuing certificates, want of a more intimate knowledge of the clauses of the Act, irregular and incomplete checking of results instead of making it an object to inspect the mature vesicle and lastly absence of prompt dealing with defaulters. Inspection of school-boys. 10. During the year systematic inspection of school-boys in all dispensary towns was started, as a result of a proposal submitted to the Commissioners' Conference by me last year for improving rural sanitation. So far, the method has not been very throughly applied but there can be no doubt of its possibilities and the subject is mentioned in most of the district reports. Itis amazing to find 12 per cent of the boys examined in one important town entirely unprotected, another 20 per cent badly pock-marked and perhaps 34 proportions and the Commissioner, Nagpur, speaks in favour of school inspections being extended, but the difficulties of men and money are very great. Preparation and supply of lymph. II. During the year 2,837 calves, or 613 less than in 1910-11, were vaccinat- ed, of which 262 were rejected for suppuration, etc., and 2,575 used as vaccinifers. The number used is still too nigh in many places and it should be remembered that 500, or more vaccinations should be possible from the lymph of one calf. (In Bilaspur, 346 calyes were used for 43,924 operations while in Raipur only 210 for 55,734 operations. In Drug, 245 were used for 29,357 operations and in Amraoti 229 for 32,654,while in Nagpur, Chanda, Bhandara, Yeotmal and Akola, half or less than half the number were used for the same number of operations.) Information has been collected with a view to forming a Central Vaccine Depôt. As different processes are found to suit different localities and it is not at all certain which will suit these Provinces best, it will be advisable to begin on a small scale for one district and, as experience indicates, extend it so as to embrace the whole Province. Until this can be achieved every district should prepare its own lymph at head-quarters, the responsibility of procuring calves in places where any difficulty is experienced, resting with the District Council which now hold control of the Vaccination Staff. Very good lymph can be, and has been, for years, obtained in this way, the admixture with glycerine preserving it and protecting it from extraneous organisms. I think there can be little doubt as to the expediency of having a Central Depôt producing lymph of uniform potency and guaranteed efficiency. A scheme is in process of preparation and will shortly be submitted to the Local Administration for sanction. Kind of lumph used and the success obtained therefrom. The total expenditure incurred in the preparation and supply of lymph during the year was Rs. 1,643-3-11 against Rs. 1,878-2-2 in the year preceding. 12. Only glycerinated calf lymph was used and the success obtained was 96.56 per cent against 96.01 in the previous year. Vaccination in Municipal towns. Appendix A. 13. In Municipal towns there were in all 39,156 births and 10,734 deaths under one year of age. The infants under one year successfully vaccinated numbered 24,210, which shows that about 15 per cent of children still remain unprotected. Plague, no doubt, accounts in part for this high percentage, but there is another factor which always conduces to the incomplete work done in Municipal towns, and that is the rules are not rigidly enforced. This I pointed out in several of my inspection notes. It is in these towns that vaccination is back- ward and opposition is generally met with and the Deputy Commissioner, Jubbul- pore, rightly remarks. &quot;I cannot say much for the attitude of the Honorary Magistrates towards vaccination ; at least it is apathetic, procedure is ponderous and there is too much readiness to accept the flimsiest of excuses and the most unreliable of medical certificates with a view to exemption. The amount of fines imposed is ridiculously light.&quot; The provisions of the Act should be extended to all Municipal towns and the rules framed thereunder properly and rigidly enforced, as, without effort in this direction, it will not be possible to improve the existing state of affairs. Death from small-pox, and the proportion of persons suc- cessfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population. Appendices B and C. 14. Deaths from small-pox rose from 2,419 in 1910-11 to 2,767 in 1911-12. Nagpur suffered severely where nearly half the number of deaths (1,367) were recorded. Here the outbreak commenced in November 1910 and continued till November 1911, when it showed signs of abatement, but, unfortunately the lymph having failed on account of slackness of supervision, the disease took a serious turn, the number of deaths amounting to 57 in December, 258 in January 1912, and 445 in the month following. In March it began to subside5 The proportion of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population was 39.99 against 38.33 (worked on the census population of 1911) in the previous year. The usual diagram is appended. General. 15. In this note an attempt has been made to summarise the existing state of affairs and the measures that were or are being taken to improve them. The Deputy Commissioner, Bhan- dara, suggests that vaccinators should be provided with travelling cases for their instruments, etc. This is a matter on which I would lay great stress. In Nagpur Municipality vaccinators were provided with small tin cases (obtained from England) in which they kept their instruments. The case was not only handy but had a sterilizing apparatus inside. It would be well if Civil Surgeons were to move the local bodies to supply such cases to their vaccinators. A very serviceable scratcher has been introduced by Colonel Buchanan and has been recommended to Civil Surgeons. It is easily kept sharp and by its use all bleeding is avoided. Many of the Civil Surgeons, Deputy Commissioners and also Commissioners comment unfavourably on the rate of pay allowed to vaccinators in these Provinces, which they say is too low. The vaccinator's salary is certainly not a handsome one, but it must be remembered that he receives it in full all the year round, whereas the working season lasts for six months only, as a rule. The pay of vaccinators in these Provinces compares favourably with the scale employed in the Punjab and United Provinces but is considerably lower than that in vogue in Bombay, where, however, the rôle of the vaccinator is somewhat different. As the scale was only recently drawn up, it is thought inexpendient to revise it again pending proof that the cost of living here is greater than in those Provinces with which it can fairly be compared. A proposal is at present being considered to bring the vaccinator up to the Bombay standard and employ him fully in the non-working season, under which circumstances his pay would have to be reconsidered. The Civil Surgeon, Saugor, draws attention to the apathy of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway Company in the matter of protecting their staff, and the Deputy Commissioner remarks that it is extraordinarily difficult to come to terms with them over medical arrangements. It is not clear why such an atti- tude, which may not only cost them dear but affects the community at large, should be adopted. The assistance of schoolmasters and tahsildars should be freely used in rural areas, and in towns Municipal authorities must be more active, lending their support and influence to aid the vaccinator instead of leaving him severely alone as is so commonly the case at present. The subject of re-vaccination is calling loudly for further recognition and the recent epidemic in Nagpur showed many instances of the disastrous results of neglecting it The immunity conferred by infant vaccination gradually decreases and it is found that at the age of 15 or so it has ceased to exist, the chances of being attacked by small-pox then becoming practically equal to those of the unprotected. If this is made known to vaccinators and to the general public it would be a step towards controlling such outbreaks as we have recently experienced. In Amraoti and Nagpur, great efforts have been made to raise the standard of work and put the staff on a more satisfactory footing. The reports from Balaghat and Bhandara show very efficient work, but in Buldana there is a considerable falling-off which demands attention. The writing up of exempted cases on the back of village forms, originally started in Nimar, is a useful procedure, as is also the furnishing of the vaccin- ator's programme for the ensuing week on the back of each weekly return. These are recommended for general adoption. The Civil Surgeon, Yeotmal, is very anxious to re-introduce the old Berar system of granting certificates to patels and patwaris for assisting in vaccination work. I think it would be a useful adjunct, and we are badly in need of some form of stimulusAPPENDIX. STATISTICAL STATEMENTS. PAGES. STATEMENT No. I.VACCINATION STATEMENT No. I.DEPARTMENT.

Area served by the Vaccin- ation Department. The area served by the Vaccination Department remained the same as in the previous year, but under orders conveyed in the Govern- ment of India, Foreign Department, letter No. 199-G., dated the 23rd January 1913, the statistics of the Feudatory States have been omitted. The Provincial Vaccination reports will therefore deal in future with the khalsa portion of the Province only. Statement I. Total number of operations performed. 2. The total number of vaccination operations performed during the season amounted to 574,510 (503,956 primary and 70,554 re-vaccinations) against 583,101 (512,312 primary and 70,789 re-vaccinations) in the previous season. Of these 574,510 operations, 570,778 (502,598 primary and 68,180 re-vaccinations) were done by the special establishment, 2,909 (1,130 primary and 1,779 re-vaccinations) by other agencies and 823 (228 primary and 595 re-vaccinations) were done in dispensaries, the proportion of persons successfully vaccinated per thousand of the population being 38.18 against 39.99 in the previous year. Work done by the special establishment. 3. The total number of operations performed by vaccinators fell from 579,782 in 1911-12 to 570,778 in 1912-13, i.e., a de- crease of 9,004 (8,533 primary and 471 re-vaccinations). Twelve districts show a decrease which is most marked in Raipur (7,657). Chanda recorded a decrease of 5,944, Nagpur of 3,231, Akola of 3,039, Damoh of 1,766 and Bhandara of 1,271. In the remaining six districts (Saugor, Nimar, Chhindwara, Wardha, Bilaspur and Drug) the fall was less than 1,000. In all these districts the prevalence of cholera and consequent deputation of the staff on cholera duty has been the chief cause for the decrease. In Damoh and Bhandara plague accounts for the decrease to some extent, in the former only 63 per cent of the available children were vaccinated and the average amount of work per vaccinator is extremely low, while in Nagpur and Raipur it is attributed to there being fewer infants available owing to a lower birth-rate and higher mortality. Perhaps this and the fact that during epidemics of small-pox in some villages, as Captain Shaw remarks, there is a fear of offending the goddess, account for the large decrease in primary operations during the season. In Chanda a very unfavourable account is given of the staff who, it is stated, are mostly men with inferior qualifications turned out of service from other departments. It is to be regretted that in spite of the unfavourable comment made in the last report, the work in Bilaspur has not in any way improved. 4. Notwithstanding the prevalence of small-pox, re-vaccination has not made any headway. In 13 districts less work was done than in the previous year. This is due in my opinion to the generally unsatisfactory state of the vaccination staff referred to later. Mr. Standen, in his forwarding note, has dwelt upon some of the disabilities of the staff and suggests that the re-vaccination of children of 12 to 13 years in primary schools can be done without much trouble provided the age is not considered too early and that a memorandum on the subject would be use- ful to District Boards. Such a leaflet has been drawn up and sent to the Director of Public Instruction for issue to schoolmasters who are the best disseminators of elementary knowledge in rural tracts. The co-operation however of Revenue and other influential officers is very necessary. Mr. Jathar remarks that he cannot recall a single occasion during his four years' service in Buldana District, on which either the vaccinator or the Assistant Superintendent of vaccination approached him while in camp with the object of seeking assistance in removing obstruction and prejudice. This subject was alluded to in the last report and Civil Surgeons should instruct vaccinators to lay their difficulties before touring officers and seek aid from them. 5. There are many complaints about the inadequacy of the staff both in numbers and intelligence, the fact being that the work can no longer be done on the terms offered. The tendency, which I think exists, to imagine that vaccina- tion is easily and successfully performed is a dangerous one and the Civil Surgeon, Raipur, mentions the village of Singarpur where owing to opposition no vaccination has been done for six years. The recent epidemics (Buldana, Nagpur, etc.) and school inspections both show how badly protected a large portion of the people are. This whole subject is coming up for consideration by the Sanitary Board after the issue of this report. The cost per successful vaccination was Re. 0-2-1 during the year.
2 Statement V. Inspection of Vaccination. 6. Civil Surgeons were 670 days out on tour, visited 3,845 villages against 3,221 in the previous year, and inspected 10.15 per cent of the primary and 13.85 of the re-vaccinations performed during the year. The prevalence of cholera hampered the work of inspection, but in some districts the Civil Surgeons have left this work entirely to their assistants. Further in some districts, e. g., Saugor, Jubbulpore, Narsinghpur and Bhandara, the practice of collecting children of different villages at certain centres does not appear to have been abandoned, more especially in Bhandara where the Civil Surgeon visited 416 villages in 31 days or over 13 villages a day which, the Commissioner remarks, is an extraordinary outturn of work. 7. Assistant Superintendents of Vaccination and other inspecting officers (Sub- Divisional Officers, etc,) were 4,367 days out on tour and inspected 51.79 per cent of the primary and 35.47 of the re-vaccinations in 19,480 villages. Considering the low pay of these men and the difficulties they had to encounter in a year of cholera, the Assistant Superintendents of Vaccination seem to have done good work except in Nagpur, where, of the two men on duty throughout the year, one was out on tour for 101 days and the other for 78 days only, which requires explanation. Now that these men have been relieved of all office work, there is no excuse for their doing an insufficient amount of touring. This matter was dealt with in paragraph 7 of last year's note but has not been observed very carefully. Inspection by the Sani- tary Commissioner. 8. During the season, I inspected 4,339 primary and 15 re-vaccinations, i. e., 35 per cent of the work done in 17 Municipal towns and 64 villages Of the former 3,761 had four good marks, 318 had three and 153 had two, and there were only 19 cases wrongly recorded. This shows that about 98 per cent of the primary operations done in these places were successful which is satisfactory work. Preparation and supply of lymph 9. The lymph used was glycerinated calf lymph which in 18 districts was prepared at the head-quarters station, while in the remaining four the vaccinators were allowed to prepare their own supply; 2,758 calves were vaccinated, of which 91 were rejected for suppuration, etc., and from the remaining about 8olbs. of crude lymph was obtained. The total expenditure incurred in the preparation was Rs. 3,932-3-10, an unusually large amount. A Central Vaccine Depôt has been sanctioned by the Local Administration and the equipment is now arriving from England. It will be started on tentative lines at the Lunatic Asylum, Nagpur, next October, and as soon as the initial difficulties of obtaining animals, storing lymph, etc., have been overcome (which will take a little time) lymph will be issued to the whole Province. The Government of India has given a grant of Rs. 50,000 for establishing the depôt, and plans for a suitable building are under consideration. Vaccination in Municipal towns. 10. There were 38,064 births and 12,299 deaths among children under one year of age during the year in Municipal towns, while the children under one year successfully vaccinated number 26,864, i. e., more children than were calculated to be available by the above rough method. This is accounted for by (1) wrong classification of age, (2) presence of immigrants from outside villages and (3) the fact that the above figure for infant mortality includes not a few children who had been vaccinated. In spite of this there are still many children unprotected but the introduction of school inspections, the co-operation of schoolmasters and the more careful appli- cation of the Vaccination Act have produced an enormous improvement in this respect. The extension of the Act to notified areas is much to be desired. Deaths from small-pox. 11. Small-pox was again severe during the year, and 4,770 deaths were recorded against 2,767 in the previous year. This number can only be accepted as approximate owing to the confusion in classifying eruptive fevers, but it is hoped that the recently issued instructions may in course of time improve matters. Almost all the districts of Nagpur, Chhattisgarh and Berar Divisions suffered from this disease which prevailed more or less throughout the year. Nagpur and Buldana returned the largest mortality3 during the past few years, as remarked by Mr. Standen, have been responsible for the epidemic. The district is lightly staffed and I hope the district authorities will give their early attention to the matter. In the northern districts, Seoni recorded 361 deaths and Jubbulpore 115. Frequent evacuation on account of plague and the consequent disorganization of vaccination is probably largely accountable for the epidemic and special efforts are therefore being made everywhere to stamp out the disease. General. 12. Several improvements have been effected during the year, viz.APPENDIX. STATISTICAL STATEMENTS. PAGES.

No. 1122/VI-32-11 Central Probinces Administration SANITARY DEPARTMENT Nagpur, the 14th October 1914. READ2 5. The Sanitary Commissioner, in paragraph 10 of his Report, comments on the fall in the number of inspections made by Civil Surgeons. A reason may be found in the increasing importance of the work at head-quarters of districts, which has tended to curtail the touring done by Civil Surgeons. The Chief Commissioner recognises the claims which his head-quarters duties have upon the Civil Surgeon's time, but the personal control that can be exercised over the work of the Vaccination Staff by a system of well-arranged village-to-village visits is of the highest importance, and, as Major Stokes has pointed out, cannot be dispensed with In this connection Sir Benjamin Robertson would like again to call attention to the remarks that were made in the Resolution on the last Triennial Report, as to the necessity for carrying out inspection as near as possible to the homes of the people and not confining it to the work of the current year. The visit of the Civil Surgeon should be aimed at seeing not only that the work of the staff has been properly done, but that it has been done with not more trouble to the people than was absolutely necessary, in order to maintain steady progress in securing general immunity from a terrible disease.

In other districts the increase ranged between 1,500 and 10,000, while in Jubbulpore, Mandla, Nimar, Akola and Nagpur less work was done and no satisfactory explanation is forthcoming. Of the 1,534,901 primary operations 1,485,243 were successful, of which latter 1,206,021 were among children under one year and 179,823 among those between one and six years of age. It is not clear why a separate column for primary vaccinations between the ages of one and six years is required. The number of successful re-vaccinations was 144,612. 6. As far as figures go, the above results indicate fair general progress except in the five districts mentioned, but a study of the average work done per Vaccinator reveals some unsatisfactory features. The highest average per man was 3,015 in Yeotmal, while in Damoh the average was 1,501 last season and always is low. The Civil Surgeon explains this figure in various ways but, even making allowance for harvest time and scarcity, I am inclined to attribute it more to a local custom on the part of the Vaccinators, and the incompleteness of the town vaccination there seems to lend colour to this explanation. In the North-West Frontier Province, where conditions are not particularly easy, the average per man in 1912-13 ranged from 3,462 to 6,535, and this suggests the idea that supervision and general organization requires bracing up in parts of this province. Many of the reports show that from 20 to 30 per cent of the infants born remain unprotected, and it is for the local authorities to devise a means of reduc- ing this figure. This can only be done by first making an accurate calculation of children available, a matter about which some confusion prevails. The number available may be taken to be the number of births registered minus the deaths under one year. It is often objected that the figure thus obtained will include many children of too tender an age to be vaccinated, but if this view is taken one- quarter to one-half of the children will remain unprotected each year. As a matter of fact these very young infants should, in making the calcula- tion, be ignored because they are compensated for by a similar balance from the previous year which should be kept on the books by the Vaccinator. The Vaccinator should note by name all cases of exemption in the village record and should submit his weekly and monthly returns of work done, with a programme of his next week's tour, regularly to the Civil Surgeon's office where it should be tabulated. Steps should be taken to see that the work is kept up-to-date in all circles. Similarly, the movements of the Assistant Superintendent of Vaccination require supervision. It has been suggested to substitute a Village Vaccination Register for the present detached form which is frequently lost and is never forthcom- ing for past years; steps will be taken to consider how this may be introduced. The district of Saugor appears to illustrate the extent to which immunity may be attained by properly directed effort, for the Civil Surgeon reports that small-pox has practically reached the vanishing point and this, in spite of a staff so poor that, as is remarked in the Jubbulpore report, &quot; it would seem the Vaccinator should apologise for his existence.&quot; The introduction of new rules and standardised lymph will give a stimulus to better work, but the details of supervision must be sharpened up and the vaccinator instructed to show himself instead of run- ning to earth on the approach of District Officers. Cost of the Department. STATEMENT II. 7. The total cost of the Department was Rs. 2,19,719-4-11 against Rs. 1,89,462-10-11 in the previous triennium. The rise is due to the increase of staff, the grant of local allowance to Vaccinators in some districts and to the establishment of the Provincial Vaccine Depôt at Nagpur. For the same reasons the cost per successful vaccination, which averaged Re. 0-1-11 during the triennium ending 1910-11,rose to Re. 0-2-1 during the period under report, but in calculating the average cost the expenditure incurred at the depôt has been omitted.
3 Dispensary Vaccination. STATEMENT III. 8. Sub-Assistant Surgeons attached to charitable and travelling dispensaries did 6,969 operations during small-pox epidemics, of which 2,573 were primary with 1,898 successful, and 4,396 re-vaccinations, of which 2,182 were successful. The Civil Surgeon. Akola, deplores the fact that Sub-Assistant Surgeons no longer vaccinate, but I think these officials were distinctly relieved at the time of the new orders. When the central factory is in full swing, there can be little objection to their operating on their own patients provided they observe the correct procedure for reporting results. Vaccination by others. 9. Medical officers attached to Railways and others did 4,473 vaccinations during the triennium. Of these 1,512 were primary and 2,961 re-vaccinations, the successful results being 1,209 for the former and 1,693 for the latter. Inspection of vaccination. STATEMENT V. 10. During the past year Civil Surgeons were out on tour for 696 days and inspected 47,699 of the primary and 9,367 of the re-vaccinations done in 3,630 villages. This is less work than was done in the two previous years, and I think there is a general tendency towards the curtailment of their inspections which cannot but be deplored. The relaxation of reliable supervision must occur at times and in busy places, but we are not prepared to dispense with it altogether by a very long way. It is very necessary to recognise that personal inspection of the work and supervision of returns by the Civil Surgeon are essential, and a reasonable amount of both can and should be carried out in all but two or three of the largest places. A Civil Surgeon who can only spare three days in the whole season of six months must either have his hands exceedingly full or else place extremely slender reliance on his staff. Assistant Superintendents of Vaccination and others, viz., Sub- Divisional Medical Officers and Assistants to Civil Surgeons, were out on tour for 4,582 days, visited 20,921 villages and inspected 282,691 or 54.82 of the primary and 34,489 or 34.71 of the re-vaccinations, a satisfactory amount of work. In Saugor, Mandla and Nagpur the amount of inspection is low. 11. Of the number inspected, the Civil Surgeons found 98.55 per cent successful in primary and 50.94 in re-vaccinations and the Assistant Superintend- ents of Vaccination and other officers found 97.59 for the former and 39.65 for the latter, the vaccinators' results being 97.85 and 65.03. Inspection by the Sanitary Commissioner. 12. During my tours I inspected the vaccination work of 15 towns. The registers showed that 5,580 children had been vaccinated with 4,889 successful results, 249 failures and 521 unknown. The actual number of children seen by me was 1,557, of which 80 per cent showed a sufficient vesicular area to secure fair immunity. There is still some evidence of irregularity in the number and method of making these insertions, and it should be clearly understood that four good vesicles (all on one arm or two on each, according to the wish of the parent), having an aggregate area of half a square inch is what is desired. It is a fairly clearly established fact that the immunity conferred by the operation is in direct proportion to the extent of the vesicular area, and there is no doubt that neglect of this considera- tion is one of the factors tending to permit the continuance of epidemic small-pox ; the other factors will be referred to later. My inspections of re-vaccination work were few because it is almost impossible to form any opinion of the efficacy of the operation at long periods after its performance. The points requiring attention in town vaccination are briefly4 50 per cent of the work, but it is to be feared that this would hardly be the case although the statement shows 97.85 per cent successful on the total. Lymph. 13. During the past year the proposed Central Depôt was opened in Nagpur in rooms lent temporarily by the Medical Depart- ment at the Lunatic Asylum. The work is being conducted on the lines of the Belgaum Vaccine Institute by a Military Assistant Surgeon and a Sub-Assistant Surgeon who both received a special training at that institute. As the accommodation does not permit of the preparation of lymph on a large scale, only two districts were supplied with lymph prepared at the depôt. A grant of Rs. 50,000 has been made by the Government of India for the construction of suitable buildings which will shortly be undertaken. There are a large number of details to be considered in starting such work, e.g., the supply of animals, cold storage, purification, methods of issue, etc., to say nothing of the design and site for buildings all of which take time. The work, however, has been started satisfactorily and will now proceed and be expanded as soon as possible. It was found that 38 calves, vaccinated during the year (of which 36 were successful), yielded 940.69 grammes of pulp or 3,788 c. c. of lymph, sufficient for 75,760 doses, and 57,780 doses were issued to the two districts. There was a considerable wastage, a certain amount of which can hardly be avoided, but attempts must be made to control this by prompt use of the material as soon as received. The expense incurred in working the depôt during the year was Rs. 7,279-13-4, of which Rs. 2,544-15-0 was spent on salaries, Rs. 334-1-0 on travelling allowance and Rs. 4,400-13-4 on miscellanous items such as ice hire and feed of calves, etc. For the current year Rs. 18,000 has been allotted and a large proportion of this sum will be required to provide calves which will have to be purchased and subsequently sold. The amount seems high, but when the depôt is in full working order and able to meet the demands of the whole province, a small charge for the lymph supplied to Local Bodies will, it is hoped, cover part of this expenditure from Provincial Funds. 14. In the other districts lymph was as usual prepared locally and 2,656 calves were vaccinated, of which 56 were rejected for suppuration, etc. On the present results of work at the depôt it is calculated that 4005 Civil Surgeon as a technical adviser, and it is, therefore, to their discredit when the work is incomplete, or when large percentages of unprotected children are found in their schools. I During the triennium the Vaccination Act was extended to the Munici- pal towns of Mowar in Nagpur and Pandhurna and Sausar in Chhindwara and withdrawn from all Notified Areas. Deaths from small-pox. 18. Deaths from small-pox rose from 2,767 (0.20 per 1,000) in 1911-12 to 5,081 (0.37 per 1,000) in 1912-13 and 6,174 (or 0.44) during the past year. Although the prevalence of epidemic small-pox has decreased very markedly when comparisons are made over long periods, as mentioned in the recent Sanitary Report, yet we are never without traces of it. Like other diseases it waxes and wanes, flaring up at times into a serious outbreak as it did in Nagpur during 1912-13, and then subsiding. The epidemiological factors producing this phenomenon are imperfectly understood, but there can be little doubt that a large unprotected population must be a potent predisposing cause. The number of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of the population was 40.05 against 38.18 last year ; the ratio is however regrettably lower than in the previous triennium, in the last year of which it reached 44.57. Regarding the treatment of small-pox, Captain Fraser, I. M. S., has made an interesting report upon the use of Iodine painted twice daily over the skin lesions. He claims for it the absence of suppuration, secondary fever, and of subsequent &quot; pitting&quot; of the skin. 19. Having proceeded thus far with this report it will be of advantage to pause and consider what are the causes actuating against a more complete control of the disease, and to examine them with a view to finding a remedy. In this connection the following remarks of Rai Bahadur S. N. Barat are of interest:6 (4) Re-vaccination should be pushed : at present the variation is between 12,286 in Seoni and 1,724 in Wardha. (5) Vaccinators should be ordered to interview touring officers and lay their difficulties before them. (6) The technique of the operation needs more care so as to obtain a satisfactory vesiculated area. General. 22. On the whole fair progress has been made during the triennial period in spite of staff difficulties, and it is to be hoped that in return for standardised lymph and a better staff the next report will show a more favourable state of affairs. It will be necessary now to draw up a complete set of rules, technical and administrative, for the guidance of local bodies and their vaccination staffs. Delay in the submission of the report. 23. This report was due in the Press on the 1st June and I regret the delay that has occurred. Many of the district reports were late and some of the returns were so inaccurate that they had to be sent back for correction. This province is unique as regards the date of submission of this report, the 1st June, and I note that the last triennial report was also late for the same reasons which caused delay in this case. As all the other provinces submit their Vaccination Reports on the 1st July, I think the same privilege might be extended to this province. T. G. N. STOKES, M. B., MAJOR, I. M.

Establishment. During the season the establishment was augmented by three men2 yielded 2,832.5 grammes of pulp or 11,822 c. c. of lymph, sufficient for 236,440 doses. Of this, 161,700 doses were issued from the Depôt. The average yield per buffalo calf was 39.64 grammes. and bovine calves yielded an average of 32.84 grammes. Except for main- taining the potency of stock lymph by carrying alternately a strain from bovine to buffalo calf and vice versâ, bovine calves have been used almost exclusively in the latter half of the season as lymph manufactured from these is not only of purer quality and lends itself better to the process of chloroforming, but the selling prices of the animals after operation, against the amounts paid for their purchase, are appreciably higher and they are easier to sell than buffalo calves. The expense incurred in working the Depôt during the year was Rs. 11,449-11-7, of which Rs. 4,348-6-6 was spent on salaries and the balance on items such as furniture, ice, purchase and feed of calves, etc. A sum of Rs. 376-9-0 was realized from the sale of post- operated animals and credited to Government. Almost a third of the amount allotted for the year has lapsed to Government, as the manufacture of lymph for the whole Province was not taken up as intended, owing to the very limited accommodation where the Depôt is temporarily working. The training class for 4th grade vaccinators began with the opening of the season, and one batch has already been trained and passed out. In addition to these, the Assistant Superintendents of Vaccination of the Nagpur Division were also given a short course of practical instruction before proceeding on their tours of inspection. &quot; Owing to limited accommodation lymph could not be prepared on a large scale for supply to all the districts in the Province. The supply was therefore extended to three more districts in the Nagpur Division during the year. In all, five districts received their supply from the Depôt and the quality is said to be good. The improvement in technique, to say nothing of the quality of the product, may be judged to some extent from the fact that 84 calves supplied lymph to five districts, while the total number of animals required in 17 districts, where local manufacture persisted, amounted to over 2,000. The special Depôt buildings, for which Government gave a grant of Rs. 50,000, are in course of construction and, when complete, the supply of lymph will be extended to the whole Province. Till then the districts of the other Divisions will have to prepare their own supply as heretofore. Inspection of Vaccination. 9. In spite of the prevalence of plague and frequent changes among Civil Surgeons a fair amount of inspection work was done. Civil Surgeons inspected 55,875 primary and 7,140 re-vaccinations against 47,699 and 9,367 in the previous year, in 3,924 villages in 591 days, but there is considerable room for improvement as in some districts the work has been behind hand. The Sub-Divisional Medical Officers hardly perform their share. The Civil Surgeon, Mandla, complains of the restriction placed on tours, but with the permission of the Deputy Commissioner these restrictions can be relaxed. The Civil Surgeon, Chanda, remarks that in his tours he only came across successful cases ; if he paid surprise visits or went into the villages and used the kotwar's book this would not be so. The Civil Surgeon Nagpur, suggests an Assistant Surgeon being posted for this duty. I agree with him, but in the present circumstances there is no man to spare. Sub-Divisional Officers and Assistant Superintendents of Vaccination spent 4,891 days out on tour and inspected 286,477 primary and 24,582 re-vaccinations in 20,955 villages. Of the number inspected, the Civil Surgeons found 96.68 per cent successful in primary and 45.18 per cent in re-vaccinations; the Assistant Superintendents of Vaccination and others found 96.89 for the former and 37.96 for the latter the results noted by the Vaccinators being 97.22 and 62.64. These figures show that the staff generally do not falsify their returns. Inspection by the Sanitary Commissioner. 10. During my tours I inspected vaccination work in 14 Municipal towns and saw 1,501 primary vaccinations, of which 85 per cent were well protected, i. e., showed three or more good insertions. In rural areas I inspected work done by 20 vaccinators in 206 villages of the Nagpur, Bhandara, Chanda, Balaghat and Seoni districts. The actual number of children seen was 3,870 or 71 per cent of the number vacci- nated ; of these, 87 per cent were well protected. Practically all this work was done with standardised lymph and the improved lancet, the results being on the whole excellent. Vaccination in Municipal Towns. 11. In the Resolution on the Triennial Report published last year, with reference to the administration of the Vaccination Act in towns, it is stated that the Chief Commissioner will hold that slackness in this respect must indicate a general want of vitality in the local Municipal organisation. It is therefore gratifying to note (Appendix A) that the percentage of children vaccinated in
3 towns has risen from 84 to 91 of those available by the ordinary method of cal- culation. This statement, however, needs qualification for in some towns the work is still unsatisfactory, thus in Umrer only 48 per cent was completed, in Arvi 75 per cent, Mandla 73 per cent, Sihora 46 per cent, Raipur 81 per cent and Dhamtari 32 per cent; these are all exceedingly poor. In Nagpur 57 per cent and in Saugor 53 per cent only was completed owing to difficulties arising from plague ; a large balance therefore remains, and steps should be taken to deal with it. On the other hand, Wardha, Chhindwara, Hinganghat, Khamgaon and Hoshangabad have not only completed their work but have vaccinated many children remaining unprotected from former years. According to vital statistics Hoshangabad shows only 289 children, but 372 were vaccinated in spite of the evacuation of the town for plagueAPPENDIX. STATISTICAL STATEMENTS. PAGES.

Administration. The Vaccination Department was administered by Major Stokes, I.M.S., till the 29th September 1915, when he reverted to Military duty, and I have since then been put in collateral charge. The strength of the Vacci- nation Establishment. 2. The strength of the establishment was increased by 7 men2 Primary vaccinations by other agencies. 5. 163 primary operations were done by other agencies; of these, 59 were done by the Railway Medical staff, 56 by the Mission in Raipur District and 48 by the Sub-Assistant- Surgeon in charge of Damoh Jail Hospital. Re-vaccination. 6. Re-vaccinations seem to be steadily gaining ground. 81,871 were done against 76,429 in 1914-153 Inspection of Vaccination- Statement V. 9. In spite of the prevalence of plague, a fair amount of inspection work was done by Civil Surgeons: 57,833 primary and 6,705 re-vaccinations were inspected by them in 4,418 villages in 598 days; but there is still much room for improvement. The Civil Surgeon, Damoh, was out on tour for only 13 days and inspected 935 primary and 210 re-vaccinations in 95 villages. The work in this district is very unsatisfactory. Civil Surgeons of small stations should be able to devote more time to inspecting the work in their districts. In Narsinghpur, Chhindwara, Balaghat, Amraoti, Yeotmal, Akola and Buldana also a very small number was inspected. The Assistant Superintendents of Vaccination and other inspecting officers, such as the Sub-Divisional Medical Officers, &c., visited 21,615 villages in 5,219 days and inspected 283,190 primary and 27,016 re-vaccinations. I regret to have to note that the practice of collecting children for inspection at different centres is still followed in many districts in spite of annual exhortations to the contrary and some district reports mention that even vaccinators also are in the habit of collecting children for vaccination. This is a very unsound procedure. The practice is irksome to the mothers, and the so-called unpopularity of vaccination among the better classes, mentioned in some of the reports, is no doubt largely due to this. The better class women, unlike their labouring and low class sisters, naturally object to carrying their babies long distances and there await the arrival of the inspecting officer for hours together. I hope Civil Surgeons will use their best endeavours to stop this system. The periodical inspection of school children by the local dispensary and the plague staff seems to have resulted in the vaccination of a large number of unpro- tected children. The Civil Surgeon, Saugor, mentions the great assistance rendered in this direction by Mr. Craddock, Inspector of Schools, to whom my thanks are due. Vaccination in Municipal townsAPPENDIX.

KING & SON, 9, Bridge Street, Westminster, London, S. W. KEGAN, PAUL, TRENCH, TRNo. 535-C/VI Central Provinces Administration SANITARY DEPARTMENT Nagpur, the 7 th September 1917. READ2 buildings for the Central Lymph Depôt, Nagpur, have been completed, it is hoped that from the next vaccination season every district will receive its supply of lymph from the Depôt and that there will be a consequent decrease in the average cost of individual vaccinations. 4. In 1915 the Central Provinces Legislative Council passed an enact- ment amending the Vaccination Act, so as to make it enforceable in towns constituted as &quot; Notified Areas &quot; under the Municipal law, and the Act is now in force in 69 towns, as against 59 at the end of the previous triennium. The Chief Commissioner regrets to observe that in several important towns vaccination work is very unsatisfactory and that no organised attempt is made to enforce the Act. Although some stimulus is required to induce the people to avail themselves of the benefits of vaccination, the Chief Commissioner believes that these benefits are thoroughly understood. A member of the Provincial Legislative Council who opposed the extension of the Vaccination Act to Notified Areas, and took the opportunity of contesting the value of vacci- nation, received short shrift at the hands of his non-official colleagues. 5. The Chief Commissioner is indebted to Colonel Robinson for his suggestive Report, and he specially desires that the lines which he has laid down for the more systematic development of vaccination in rural areas should receive careful attention. Sir Benjamin Robertson entirely endorses his opinion as to the necessity for supervision and better organisation, and he is in full agreement with the remarks made in paragraph 5 of the Report as to the manner in which Assistant Superintendents should perform their duties.

TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES AND BERAR FOR THE YEARS 1914-15, 1915-16 & 1916-17. Area and population. The area served by the Vaccination Department and the population remained the same as in the previous triennium, viz., 99,823 square miles with 13,916,308 souls. Establishment. 2. The establishment was augmented by 3 Assistant Superintendents of Vaccination and 9 vaccinators. The Assistant Superin- tendents were posted to Akola, Buldana and Drug districts, which were too large for proper supervision by one Assistant Superin- tendent of Vaccination. As regards vaccinators, 3 men were entertained at the Central Vaccine Depôt, Nagpur, 3 in Akola district, 2 each in Nagpur and Raipur districts, and 1 in Drug, while Betul and Balaghat reduced their staff by 1 each. The establishment during the triennium, therefore, stood at 36 Assistant Superintendents of Vaccination and 307 vaccinators as compared with 33 and 298 respectively in the previous triennium, but owing to want of suitable men to fill vacancies among vaccinators, especially in Berar, only 304 men were borne on the rolls at the close of the triennium. 3. The scheme for improving the pay and prospects of the staff came into force on 1st October 1914. The men in the Central Provinces seem happy and contented, but in Berar the pay does not seem to be attractive, and I fear that sooner or later it will have to be supplemented by suitable allowances. Total vaccination operations performed in the triennium. STATEMENT I. 4. The following table illustrates the progress of vaccination during the past two triennial periods :2 to the required standard by hurrying on from village to village. Unfor- tunately, in their attempts at rapid movement, they not only leave the work in the villages they visit unfinished, but also fail in their endeavours to secure the prescribed standard. In many cases they have failed to reach even a minimum standard of 2,000. Some Civil Surgeons say that their &quot; vaccinators vaccinated almost all the available children in their districts without being able to reach the minimum standard &quot;, and some plead that &quot; the conditions obtaining in their dis- tricts do not allow of their vaccinators exerting themselves more than what they have been doing&quot;; these are frivolous arguments. In the former case, the number of vaccinators employed, is more than is needed and may safely be reduced as proposed in the Betul district, while in the latter case, I do not think that the conditions existing in these Provinces are so bad as those in the North- West Frontier Province, where the average per man ranged from 3,500 to 6,000. When 5,000 to 6,000 operations could be done by some vaccinators in the hilly and jungly districts of Chhindwara and Yeotmal, I do not understand why the vaccinators working in the plains having thickly populated villages, should not be expected to attain this number. I am of opinion that supervision and general organization require bracing up in many parts of the Province, and this is a matter Civil Surgeons and local bodies can remedy if they care to exert them- selves. It is strange that there is no 4th grade or spare vaccinator in the Balaghat district to take the place of men on the regular staff on leave or otherwise absent. The Civil Surgeons of Drug and Mandla suggest Patels and Kotwars being made responsible for having all children in their villages vaccinated. This would very much lessen the troubles not only of the vaccinators but also of the Revenue Officers (Tahsildars, etc.) who are off and on called on to advise those refusing vaccination, but as vaccination is not compulsory in rural tracts, it is doubtful if such an order can be issued. 6. I congratulate Mr. Clarke, the Deputy Commissioner of Nagpur, and Lieutenant-Colonels Buchanan and Kenrick, Civil Surgeons of Saugor and Jub- bulpore, on the excellent results obtained through their exertions. Mr. Clarke's circulars and instructions to District Councils and Municipal Committees were so sound and thorough that in spite of the severe epidemic of plague, which raged all over the district throughout the vaccination season, more than four-fifths of the available children in the Nagpur district were successfully vaccinated in 1916-17. Lieutenant-Colonels Buchanan's and Kenrick's endeavours kept the districts of Saugor and Jubbulpore absolutely free from small-pox during the past two years. Vaccination by others than the special staff. 7. No work was done by the Sub-Assistant Surgeons attached to dispen- saries as no emergency arose. The Jail and Railway Medical staff performed 4,861 operations, of which 951 were primary and 3,910 revaccinations. Cost of the Department. STATEMENT II. 8. The total cost of the Department was Rs. 3,36,559-1-1 against Rs. 2,19,719-4-11 in the previous triennium, and the cost per each successful vaccination, which averaged Re. 0-2-1 in the past triennial period, rose to Re. 0-3-2 during the period under report, the chief causes of the increase being the establishment of the Central Vaccine Depôt at Nagpur, the improvement in the pay of the vaccination staff, grant of conveyance allowance to the Assistant Superintendents of Vaccination and the introduction of the village vaccination registers. 9. Statement IV does not call for any remarks. Inspection of vaccination. STATEMENT V. 10. In spite of the prevalence of plague, a satisfactory amount of inspection was done by Civil Surgeons. They inspected 10.80 per cent of the primary vaccinations performed in 1914-15 and 9.35 of the revaccinations. In the following year, the percentage inspected was 11.31 for primary and 8.19 for revaccinations, while in 1916-17 only 8.45 of the primary and 12.41 of the revaccinations were inspected, as
3 these officers were in that year removed from the list of touring officers. They have now to inspect only such of the villages as lie on their way to dispensary towns. I fear it will lead very rapidly to marked deterioration in both the quantity and quality of vaccination work. In this connection the Deputy Com- missioner, Bhandara, writes &quot; The stoppage of Civil Surgeons' touring is a dangerous experiment, but may be justified as a war measure. &quot; 11. The Assistant Superintendents of Vaccination and Sub-Divisional Medical Officers at Ellichpur, Basim and Khamgaon combined, inspected 55.35 per cent of the primary and 32.19 of the revaccinations performed in the first year of the triennium, 55.39 and 33.00 in the second year and 54.94 and 31.46 in 1916-17. I am not at all satisfied with the inspec- tion work of these men. The Sub-Divisional Officers inspected very little during the past two years. Perhaps frequent changes on account of the withdrawal of these officers for military duty, or that they were much less capable and experienced officers than in prewar days, hampered their inspec- tion work, but in regard to Assistant Superintendents of Vaccination, I would say that their work is very perfunctorily done. To swell their inspection figures, these men hurry from village to village, sometimes inspecting 10 to 12 a day, merely looking at the arms of the vaccinated children collected by the kotwars. This sort of work is quite useless. They should make sufficiently long stays to find out whether the vaccinator vaccinated all the available children, whether any remain unvaccinated, and if so, whether the vacci- nator saw them and noted their names in the village registers, giving reasons for leaving them unvaccinated. If every Assistant Superintendent of Vaccination were to inspect 3 to 4 villages a day in the manner indicated above, he would be able to satisfactorily inspect about 5 to 6 hundred villages during the vaccination season. I hope Civil Surgeons will impress on their subordinates the necessity for such systematic inspections, since Civil Surgeons have now no chance of devoting their personal attention to this matter. Some Assistant Superintendents of Vaccination are in the habit of vaccinating with their own hands the children left unvaccinated by the vaccinators. This may be unsound and tend to encourage lazy vaccinators. Assistant Superintendents should bring such cases at once to notice and have the delinquents fined. 12. The Civil Surgeon, Jubbulpore, suggests reduction in the number of days the Assistant Superintendents of Vaccination are expected to be out on tour, and says that they should be allowed to spend at least 7 days in every month at the head-quarters station, as their long tours in one direction keep them ignorant of what is going on in the other. As these men have to remain on tour only 135 days out of the 182 days of the vaccination season, the Civil Surgeons can order them to spend the remaining 47 days at head-quarters. No reduction in the number of days fixed for their tour of inspection is therefore necessary. Civil Surgeons should arrange the Assistant Superintendents' tours and not merely allow these men to do as they please in making out the season's programme. The Civil Surgeon, Saugor, has let the Sub-Assistant Surgeons inspect vaccination work in villages situated within a ten-mile radius of their dispensaries, so that the Assistant Superintendent of Vaccination may be able to devote more time to the inspection of the distant villages. The procedure should not have been adopted without reference to the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, as the Local Administration has ordered the withdrawal of Sub-Assistant Sur- geons from all vaccination work except when small-pox is prevalent. Percentage of success in primary and revaccination. 13. The percentage of success in primary operations recorded by vaccinators during the past 3 years, was 97.22, 97.58 and 97.71, while the Assistant Superintendents of Vacci- nation found on inspection 96.89, 97.23 and 97.41 and Civil Surgeons 96.68, 97.93 and 97.97. These figures seem satisfactory, and show that the vaccinators generally do not falsify their records, but during the course of my inspection in Municipal towns, I found many cases with two marks only. Four good cicatrices should
4 always be aimed at. The success in revaccinations, recorded by vaccinators and the inspecting officers, varies considerably. This is due to the time that has lapsed between the operation and inspection as the marks from revaccination gradually become faint. Preparation and supply of lymph 14. As the special buildings for locating the Central Vaccine Depôt were not ready, lymph could not be prepared on a large scale for supply to the whole province. Only 7 districts 5 of plague in 1916-17 is said to have retarded vaccination, but I am of opinion that want of proper supervision and the consequent neglect of the vaccinator are also responsible. During my recent tours of inspection, I found vaccination work very unsatisfactory in several of the important towns. The vaccinators' registers, especially the birth registers, were incomplete ; no careful note was made of the unvaccinated children, who therefore escaped notice. In fact no organised attempt was made to enforce the Vaccination Act. I hope Civil Surgeons will use their best endeavours and get as many of the unprotected children as possible vaccinated before the commencement of the next vaccination season. It is no use expecting much help from the Municipal authorities. It the vaccinators' registers are carefully kept and up to date, a notice through the Municipal authorities will bring the person responsible to the vaccination station, and if the notice fails, prosecution should be instituted without delay, so as to punish the offender, but the punishment to be effective should be heavy in a few selected cases. 20. The provisions of the Vaccination Act were, during the triennium, extended to the towns of Etawa in the Saugor district, Sohagpur and Itarsi in Hoshangabad, Betul and Multai in Betul, Sindi in Wardha, Khapa and Katol in Nagpur, Gondia in Bhandara,Bhatapara in Raipr and Drug in the Drug District. Deaths from small-pox and the proportion of persons protected by vaccination. APPENDIX B. 21. It is satisfactory to note that small-pox has declined considerably during the past few years. There were 6,174 deaths from this disease in 1913-14, which fell to 3,133 in the following year, while in the next two years they numbered 865 and 292 only, and some districts, such as Saugor, Jubbulpore and Chhindwara, remained free. The disease still persists in the Chhattisgarh and Berar districts, and unless systematic efforts are made on the lines indicated in previous reports, and a larger proportion of the population is protected by vaccination and revaccination, it is difficult to eradicate the scourge. The protection afforded now-a-days6 (4) A system of issuing certificates to school masters, who have rendered help in the cause of vaccination, has been started. (5) A badge to be worn like a medal on the left breast of a vaccinator to denote that he is a Public Vaccinator, has been introduced. (6) Some vaccinators have also been entrusted with quinine for sale in villages where there are no quinine vendors. 24. From the above it will be seen that everything possible has been done to facilitate the progress of vaccination, and it now rests with the Local Bodies and their technical advisersAPPENDIX.

NOTES ON VACCINATION IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES AND BERAR FOR THE SEASON 1917-18. Administration. The Department was administered by Surgeon-General Robinson, C.B., I.M.S., throughout the year, except for a few days in March, when Lieutenant-Colonel Bensley, I.M.S., was in temporary charge. Staff employed. 2. The number of Assistant Superintendents of Vaccination remained the same as in the previous year, but the staff of Vaccinators was increased by 42 Cost of the Department. Statement II. 5. The total cost of the Department rose from Rs. 1,19,096-5-1 to Rs. 1,21,995-12-1 on account of the development of the Central Provinces Vaccine Institute and working expenses connected therewith. Since October 1917, the Institute has been supplying lymph to all the districts in the Province. Excluding the expenditure at this institution, the cost of the District Establishment stands at Rs. 1,04,835-13-10 or Rs. 3,726-2-1 less than in 1916-17. This is mainly due to lymph being no longer prepared at District Head-quarters at the expense of Local Bodies. The cost of each successful vaccination to Local Bodies also has in consequence fallen from Re. 0-3-5 to Re. 0-3-1. Preparation and supply of lymph. 6. The special buildings for locating the Central Provinces Vaccine Institute were handed over to the Department in July 1917, and from the 1st October 1917 the whole Province was supplied with lymph prepared at the Institute. The quality of this lymph is highly spoken of by all Civil Surgeons. The following is a note on its working during the past year, drawn up by the Superintendent-in-charge :3 9. The Assistant Superintendents of Vaccination inspected 237,887 or 46.34 per cent of the primary and 21,902 or 25.55 per cent of the re-vaccinations in 17,214 villages. In the previous year, they inspected 263,148 primary and 21,218 re-vaccinations. The fewer number of operations inspected during the past year is due to the more detailed inspections required and the restrictions placed on their movements in accordance with the suggestions made in para- graph 11 of the last Report on Vaccination. Vaccination in Municipal towns. 10. The remarks in the Provincial Reports and in the Resolutions of the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner have improved vaccination work in many Municipal towns. During the past year 28,516 or 93 per cent of the available infants were successfully vaccinated, but in many Municipal towns, e. g., those of Nagpur, Bhandara, Wardha, Hoshangabad, Betul, Raipur, Amraoti and Akola, there are still a large proportion of unprotected children, and unless the Municipal authorities take an active interest and do their duty to the community, it is useless to expect any improvement in the number of protected children. Some of these Municipal authorities ignore the advice and instructions of Civil Surgeons and the Sanitary Commissioner : the Vaccination Act and the rules framed thereon require the establishment of vaccination stations at different centres, but in many Municipal towns there are no such stations, and even where they are established, steps are not taken to have children regularly sent to them for vaccination and inspection purposes. The consequence is that the vacci- nator has to go from house to house with all his numerous registers and equipment, and beg the parents to allow their children to be vaccinated. This entails unnecessary and heavy work on the vaccinator and leads often to his neglecting his prime duty, i. e., of sterilising his lancets before each operation. Such instances have been reported from Wardha, Balaghat and Bhandara in the last of which only six children were brought to the vaccination station during the whole season. Notices signed by responsible officials have no effect as prosecutions are very rare. Prosecution and heavy fines in a few selected cases, as has been done in Hinganghat (where a Marwari was fined Rs. 50 for not having his child vaccinated), are the only ways to improve matters. I would also recommend the appointment of female vaccinators in places where purdah nashin ladies wish to have their children vaccinated at their houses. The Municipal Committee might charge a small fee in such cases. A Vaccination Post in charge of a female vaccinator at every Dufferin Hospital would be useful. To carry out this suggestion suitable candidates as vaccinators would have to be carefully selected and trained. Perhaps some Municipality will adopt this system. Deaths from small-pox. 11. 981 deaths from small-pox were reported during the year against 292 in the previous year. The largest number of deaths was reported from Buldana District where, as has been stated before, vaccination work has not been satisfactory of late. Raipur, Bilaspur and Akola also reported a good number and unless special measures are taken I fear that sooner or later there will be a severe epidemic. General. 12. Primary vaccination has on the whole been satisfactory, but re-vaccina- tion is calling loudly for more recognition. It would be well if re-vaccination is enforced in schools. The Civil Surgeon, Balaghat, suggests vaccinators being allowed to inspect school children and record their inspection notes in the Visitors' Book, but I think the procedure would create friction. I regret that the report is delayed this year and hope it will not occur next. C. R. M. GREEN, M.D., F.R.C.S., D.P.H., COL., I.M.S., NAGPUR: Sanitary Commissioner, Central Provinces.

NOTES ON VACCINATION IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES AND BERAR FOR THE SEASON 1918-19. Administration. The Department was administered during the season by Colonel Green, I.M.S., till the 28th November when I resumed charge. Total number of vaccination operations performed. 2. The total number of operations performed during the year was 539,133 which shows a decrease of 65,673 compared with the figures of the preceding year. Of this number, 538,216 were performed by the special staff and the remaining 917 by other agencies, i. e., the Railway Medical staff and Sub-Assistant Surgeons attached to Jail Hospitals. Vaccination performed by the special staff . 3. The vaccinators performed 447,537 primary and 90,679 re-vaccinations. The primary vaccinations were less by 71,141 than in the previous year. All the districts show a decrease except Nagpur and Akola; in the former, especially in Nagpur city, where the work had been very incomplete in recent years, great efforts were made to vaccinate the large number of unprotected children left over from previous years. The decrease in the other districts is mainly due to the epidemic of influenza which not only carried off many children but entirely disorganized vaccination work for over three months in the season. To make up arrears the Local Administration was pleased to extend the working season by two months, i. e., up to the end of May 1919, but the period was not sufficient, since in some districts both the children available for vaccination as well as the vaccination staff had not yet recovered from the effects of influenza. Yet much has been done, and had it not been for a widespread epidemic of cholera in the Province which claimed the attention of the staff, I am of opinion that results would have been much better. On the whole, the staff has had a very trying time during the past season. 4. There was an increase (+ 5,465) in the number of re-vaccinations done by the staff which is due to the prevalence of small-pox in many districts which induced parents to get their grown up children vaccinated. Besides, the monthly school inspections by the dispensary medical officers and the plague staff had also something to do with this increase. These medical officers brought to light many unvaccinated children who were subsequently vaccinated with the help of the school masters most of whom render great help now-a-days in the cause of vaccination, otherwise re-vaccination, as stated by the Civil Surgeon, Wardha, attracts little interest from the people except when small-pox is in their midst; that infant vaccination does not confer lifelong immunity from the disease is a truth not believed by many and requires to be taught in the schools. The arrival from outside of famine immigrants probably swelled this figure also. Cost of the Department. 5. The total cost of the Department was Rs. 1,33,058-10-8 or Rs. 11,062-14-7 over the previous year. The chief increase was under establishment charges owing to the promotion of the vaccinators from the lower to the higher grades and to the payment of allowances to compensate the staff for the dearness of foodstuffs, etc. The cost per successful case has in consequence risen from Re. 0-3-7 to Re. 0-4-7. The smaller number of operations performed during the season also accounts for the increase in cost. Preparation and supply of lymph. 6. Lymph is now supplied to all districts from the Central Provinces Vaccine Institute, Nagpur, which, under orders of the Local Administration, charges three pies per dose of vaccine. The Institute has throughout the year been under the charge of Assistant Surgeon Gomes who has submitted an interesting report on its working which on the whole has been satisfactory. The following is an extract from it :2 &quot; The whole Province comprised of 22 districts was supplied regularly with vaccine every week. Casual supplies were given to Assistant Surgeon, Bengal-Nagpur Railway, Nagpur, and Great Indian Peninsula Railway, Bina, Central Jails, Nagpur and Raipur, all the Feudatory States of Central Provinces, Military Hospitals at Pachmarhi, Kamptee, Nagpur and to Bhopal State. &quot; 297 calves were vaccinated during the year, and the total yield of pulp amounted to 8,359.25 grammes equivalent to 713,340 doses of vaccine; 646,980 doses were issued to the vaccinators and 23,480 in casual supplies. &quot;The average purchase price per calf was Rs. 10-10-6 and on an average Rs. 8-1-0 was realised per calf in the local bazaars by the Assistant Superintendent. &quot; The total expenditure incurred was Rs. 19,458-15-8, of which Rs. 6,742-3-3 were spent on salaries and travelling allowances and the rest on the purchase and feed of calves, ice, etc.; Rs. 2,724-5-3 were realized on the sale of healed calves, rotatory lancets and vaccine. &quot; The cost per dose of vaccine manufactured was pies four ( Re. 0-0-4 ) only. &quot;The results of primary vaccination were 98 per cent case success and 89 per cent insertion success and for re-vaccination 63 per cent case success and 49 per cent insertion success. &quot; The Assistant Superintendent conducted the Training Class. Twenty-five fourth grade vaccinators and one first grade vaccinator were trained and given certificates of efficiency in vaccination and sanitation by the Sanitary Commissioner&quot; 7. The buildings which are originally provided only as a skeleton have not sufficient accommodation. Additional buildings have just been sanctioned, and when these are ready, the present inconvenience which is felt will disappear. The lymph prepared at the Institute is reported by almost all Civil Surgeons as good. In some of the district reports it is mentioned that it gave poor results during the hot weather, but this, as stated by the Civil Surgeon, Bilaspur, is due to vaccinators having failed to use it soon after its receipt. Now that Local Bodies have to pay for the lymph supplied to their vaccinators, they will, I hope, adopt stringent measures to secure its use as soon as it reaches their vaccinators. In parts of Mandla, lymph is still prepared by the vaccinators, and 77 calves are said to have been used, which should be enough to supply lymph to seven districts! This should be stopped at once, and the Civil Surgeon will be instructed accordingly. Inspection of Vaccination. 8. Civil Surgeons report that they inspected 36,334 primary and 5,918 re-vaccinations in 3,032 villages. This is low in com- parison with what they did in the previous year, but the circumstances of the season were such that they could not devote much time to this work. On the whole, a fair amount of vaccination was inspected in most districts. The Civil Surgeons of the two small districts, Betul and Narsinghpur, do not appear to realize their responsibilities as Health Officers of their districts. They have done practically no inspection work, though others, with more important charges, have done much, and their time should be better apportioned in future. Some Civil Surgeons include in their work the inspections done by their assistants and the travelling dispensary staff. This is incorrect. The Assistant Superintendents of Vaccination and other inspecting officers seem to have inspected a good number3 It is a regrettable fact that although in vaccination we possess a certain preventive of a deadly disease, Municipal Committees are often so absorbed in petty affairs that they shut their eyes to it. Year after year the work is incom- plete (75 per centAPPENDIX. STATISTICAL STATEMENTS. PAGES. STATEMENT No. I.A.DEPARTMENT. Central Provinces and Berar during the year 1918-19. Vaccination.

No. 391-B/ IX. Central Probinces Administration SANITARY DEPARTMENT Nagpur, the 4th November 1920. READ2 4. In municipal towns, vaccination work was far from satisfactory, the percentage of vaccinations during the year 1919-20 being less than in the two previous years. The Sanitary Commissioner points out that this is due to lack of supervision on the part of municipal health officers and to the want of suitable vaccination stations within municipal limits where the children can be brought for vaccination and inspection. In the matter of vaccination, as in other problems of general sanitation, good results cannot be achieved unless the Municipal Committees realise their responsibilities and the people are sufficiently educated to see that their representatives on the local bodies perform their duties. 5. During the period under review the special buildings which were erected for the Vaccine Institute were handed over to the Institute, which now supplies all the 22 districts in the province with vaccine. In municipal towns, the vaccination season was prolonged so that vaccination may be carried out throughout the year. A vaccination manual was compiled and issued for the guidance of the staff, and Sanitary Inspectors employed in municipal towns were trained in the technique of vaccination and were appointed Superintendents under Section 7 of the Vaccination Act. A suitable vaccination case was. also introduced. ORDER.TABLE OF CONTENTS. PARAS.

Introductory. The annual notes for 1917-18 and 1918-19 contained observations on the more important features of the work of those years while this report deals more fully with the vaccination work performed during the triennium as a whole. Administration. 2. The Department was administered by the Hon'ble Colonel (now Major-General) Robinson, C.B., I.M.S., in 1917-18 except for a few days in March 1918, when Lieut-Colonel Bensley, I.M.S., was in charge. Lieut.-Colonel Bensley made over the duties on the 13th April 1918 to the Hon'ble Colonel Green, M.D., I.M.S., from whom Lieut.-Colonel Stokes, I.M.S., took over on the 28th November 1918 -and remained in charge till the close of the triennium. Area and population. 3. The area served by the Vaccination Department, and the population, remained the same as in the previous triennium2 Work done by the regular staff. 6. The number of vaccinations performed by the District Council and Municipal vaccinators during the triennium was 1,612,814 of which 1,352,954 were primary and 259,860 revaccinations (518,678 primary and 85,782 revaccinations in 1917-18,447,537 and 90,679 in 1918-19 and 386,739 and 83,399 in 1919-20). All districts except Nagpur, Nimar and Bilaspur, show a decrease, the most marked being Yeotmal, where the decrease is 22,245. Betul shows a fall of 20,785, Raipur 17,411 and Chanda 15,797. The decrease in Yeotmal is not to be wondered at. The district has an inadequate staff, and when the Sanitary Commissioner offered to help the District Board in January 1920 by temporary measures to tide over their present difficulties, the Board kept the matter in abeyance for four months before replying. District vaccination cannot be expected to progress in the face of such apathy. Chanda is a very backward tract where it is not possible to get the type of man required, and the present pay does not attract men from outside. The cause of the large falling off in Betul and Raipur districts is not quite apparent, but I am inclinded to think that lack of supervision on account of the many changes among Civil Surgeons is a big factor. 7. The average number of persons vaccinated by each vaccinator during 1919-20 has been very low in every district except Yeotmal, Bilaspur and Bala- ghat, where the vaccinators worked up to the minimum standard laid down. I am glad to note that Damoh shows an improvement in this respect. Vaccinations performed by other agencies. 8. The Jail and Railway medical officers performed 1,918 operations of which 591 were primary and 1,327 revaccinations, the figures for the two previous years being 261 and 85 and 349 and 568 respectively. Dispensary vaccination. Statement III. 9. As there is no vaccinator at Pachmarhi the local Sub-Assistant Surgeon was detailed to perform vaccination in that Municipality. He did 436 vaccinations in 1919-20 of which 23 were primary and 413 revaccinations. Cost of the Department. Statement II. 10. The total cost of the Department was Rs. 3,97,305-5-9 against Rs. 3,36,559-1-1 in the preceding triennium, and the cost for each successful vaccination averaged annas four and pies eight, against annas three and pies two. The increase is mainly due to the expansion of the work at the Vaccine Institute, Nagpur, which, on the 1st October 1917, extended its supply to all the twenty-two districts in the province and also to some Feudatory States and Military authorities. Grant of war and scarcity allowances to the staff also contributed towards the increased cost. Inspection of vaccination. Statement V. 11. The inspection work performed by Civil Surgeons and their assistants in 1916-17 and 1917-18 has already been commented on in the notes for those years, and it is therefore un- necessary to recapitulate in this report. In 1919-20, many of the Civil Surgeons seem to have taken little interest in this part of their duties3 for a whole-time sanitary officer as his duties at the head-quarter station leave him no time to perform vaccination inspection. I am in entire agreement with the opinion of the Divisional Commissioner that the reasons given by the Civil Surgeon of Narsinghpur to account for the unsatisfactory inspection of his district are inadequate. I hope Civil Surgeons will make a genuine effort to do more inspections in future, as it is useless to leave this important part of their duties entirely in the hands of their subordinates. 12. The Assistant Superintendents of Vaccination, Sub-Divisional Medical Officers and Assistants to Civil Surgeons seem to have done a fair amount of inspection4 The total sum reafised by the sale of healed calves, rotatory lancets, vaccine, etc amounted to Rs. 4,126-3-9. The Assistant Superintendent conducted the training class for vaccinators ; 26 fourth grade vaccinators were trained and given certificates of efficiency in vaccination and sanitation by the Sanitary Commissioner. 20 Sanitary Inspectors were also trained in the technique of vaccination by the Super- intendent. The cost per dose of vaccine manufactured was pies three (Re. 0-0-3) only. The results of primary vaccination were 97 per cent case success, 87 per cent insertion success, and for revaccination 57 per cent case success and 41 per cent insertion success.&quot; 16. The quality of lymph is reported to be good and the supply sufficient except in a few districts where on enquiry it was found that vaccinators themselves were responsible for not keeping up their stock and for allowing the lymph supplied to deteriorate. Stringent instructions were issued to the staff but there are still recalcitrants who simply waste their supply. In Betul 28 per cent of the doses supplied were used and 72 per cent unaccounted for. In Narsinghpur the wastage was 60 per cent, in Buldana 54 and in Jubbulpore 51. This wastage is a loss to the District Councils concerned who now have to pay for the vaccine supplied to their staff, and Civil Surgeons should take serious notice of delinquents in this respect. Vaccination in Municipal towns. APPENDIX A. 17. In 1919-20 the births registered in municipal towns and notified areas were 37,888 and deaths among children under one year of age were 11,037. Of those that remained alive, 22,508 or 84 per cent were successfully vaccinated which is less than the percentage vaccinated in the two previous years. The reason for this is not far to seek: lack of supervision, as in the case of Jubbulpore where the Health Officer has not inspected a single vaccination5 An increased rate of pay of the vaccination staff is required to attract suitable men. The Deputy Commissioner, Nagpur, and the Commissioner, Nagpur Division, recommend the adoption of the old procedure of allowing rewards to vaccinators who do good work. This will be considered along with the pro- posals for revising the pay of the establishment which Commissioners have been requested to call for from District Bodies. Cause of delay in the submission of the report 21. I regret the delay in the submission of this report which is due partly to the extension of the vaccination season by two monthsAPPENDIX.
