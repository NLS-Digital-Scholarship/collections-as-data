REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS FOR THE YEAR 1879. BY A.J. PAYNE, M.D., Surgeon-General for Bengal. Calcutta: PRINTED AT THE BENGAL SECRETARIAT PRESS. 1880.
REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS FOR THE YEAR 1879. No. 1585. FROM A. J. PAYNE, ESQ., M.D., Surgeon-General for Bengal, TO THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL, MEDICAL AND MUNICIPAL DEPARTMENT. Dated Calcutta, the 20th April 1880. SIR, I HAVE the honor of reporting on the Medical Institutions of Calcutta for the year 1879. 2. In former reports on these institutions, certain dispensaries in the suburbs have been included. I am unable to ascertain the reason of this, and can only suppose that it was due to their neighbouring situation. They belong in position to the 24-Pergunnahs; they are reported on by the Civil. Surgeon with the other district dispensaries, and are in all respects under the control of the district authorities and local committees as the others are. Their practice and statistics are comparable with other district institutions, rather than with Metropolitan Hospitals. They occupy the same position as dispensaries at sudder stations in the mofussil, which are not separated from district dispen- saries in the reports, and there seems to be no reason for detaching them from the local administration to which they belong. Some of these reasons would be reasons also for excluding the Howrah General Hóspital from this report, but there are others which make its inclusion desirable. It is a general hospital receiving both European and Native patients. Some of the former races are among the registered inhabitants of the town, viz. the seamen of the port of Calcutta. It is the only hospital with European inmates whose finances are not directly controlled by Government, and is useful for comparison with the general hospitals of the town. I propose therefore to deal with the Howrah Hospital as it has been dealt with in former years, and to treat of the suburban dispen- saries in the general report on dispensaries of the province. 3. Health of Calcutta.2 REPORT ON THE 4. The institutions under report are named in the following table:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 3 I am unable to suggest any inferences from this table. By its form it purports to give data for estimating the prevalence of sickness among separate communities, but several considerations weigh against this use of the figures. They are themselves wanting in precision. It is difficult, if not impossible, to classify the mixed inmates of a Calcutta hospital with exactness sufficient for statis- tical reckoning. Eurasians often represent themselves to be Europeans, and Native Christians pass for Eurasians. Even if distinction were clear enough to admit of comparison with census race numbers, there would remain a difficulty connected with the social classes to which hospital patients belong, a point in which the census itself is confessedly weak. If we add to this the fact that the number of admissions is affected by hospital accommodation, and in some places even determined by it, we have a certainty that no statis- tical purpose can be served by analysis of the table. For a similar reason I omit the proportional tables hitherto given to show numbers per cent which the several communities contribute to the total sick. STATEMENT NO. III. YEARS.

Admission of moribund persons.CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 7 persons dying from these conditions, as some of the bodies do not reach the dead-house; but they are sufficient to show the magnitude of the error which would ascribe the deaths recorded in past years to the construction of the hospital. 14. Enteric fever in Calcutta.8 REPORT ON THE years from 1871 to 1876, and three only in the succeeding three years. Remittent fever was much more prevalent during the latter period. In the General Hospital the numbers of typhoid cases were uniformly high, and those of remittent fever low. At Howrah typhoid did not appear in the records till 1877, when the management of the hospital passed into new hands. At the Mayo Hospital there is record of the disease during five consecutive years and none for the last three years, when remittent fever has been at its highest point. The most remarkable cases are those of the Campbell and Police Hospitals. In three years the Campbell Hospital recorded an extraordinary number of typhoid cases. The disease then ceased suddenly, and simultane- ously remittent fever rose largely. In the Police Hospital, where only the sick of the police force are received, the number of typhoid cases recorded was very high, and remittent fever did not appear for seven years. In 1878 the management changed hands and the order was reversed. 17. It seems clear from the foregoing that the general record of typhoid fever in the Calcutta hospitals does not present the history of a distinct disease, and that if the specific fever has existed, of which there is little doubt, it is impossible to say how much or how little of it is represented in the returns. One physician, finding that a case entered in his books as malarial fever presents, during life or after death, some of the appearances which attend the specific disease, will record the case as specific; another, recognizing the fact that the clinical and pathological phenomena which make up the typhoid condition often attend severe fever of other origin and are seen in disease not usually classed as febrile at all, will not employ a name which has come to signify a fever caused by filth alone, unless he have other evidence of specific character. 18. Again, the records of the year in these large hospitals may, in the public interest, be usefully examined for evidence of the progress which the employment of the mixed cinchona alkaloids, as a substitute for quinine, is making in large centres of medical practice. The evidence which I propose to submit is not that of written opinion, for in truth the subject is not mentioned in any of the hospital reports as a matter of opinion, but the new drug has been largely used, and I infer from this that the medical officers consider its value no longer open to discussion.

Finance.CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 9 Store Department, prohibits comparison between the total sums now returned and those which have preceded. With regard to forms, &c., the table for 1879 is itself incomplete, inasmuch as no account has ever been taken of papers supplied by the Stationery Department. It is incomplete also in respect of special endowment funds. At the Medical College it has been usual to include the expenditure from these funds in the miscellaneous charges, though they are in no way related to hospital charges proper. In the General Hospital the distinction has been observed so far that these funds have not been mentioned in the annual returns at all. In this way they have not vitiated the record of real hospital expenditure; but diversity of practice has rendered just comparison between the institutions impossible on the figures. It would delay this report, which is already late, if I were to attempt the rectification of accounts in this respect, as it would be necessary to present separate statements of fund affairs and to recast the whole. Moreover, the Accountant-General is engaged in compiling a history of all these special endowments, which when complete will show the best method of dealing with them in reports of this kind. Meanwhile I will endeavour in the following paragraphs to prevent erroneous conclusions from entries which have no bearing on hospital management. 20. It will be understood from what has been said that in reviewing income and expenditure on the lines of the table a full analysis of every entry is required to make a true and intelligible statement. The table is, I think, sufficiently complete and exact to afford, with such analysis, a true account of financial condition and progress in respect of all matters relating to hospital management, and to make comparison of future years with 1879 easy. It has been a tedious task to obtain such information as is necessary for just comparison with past years. Even for 1878 all the points are not elucidated, and for earlier years a few of them only can be presented. It follows that a review of the accounts of 1879 in narrative form will be found to have only occasional points of contact with earlier records. STATEMENT NO. VIII RECEIPTS AND DISBURSEMENTS.

In the table the total expenditure in 1879 appears as Rs. 3,70,744 to compare with Rs. 3,64,484 in 1878. The apparent increase is due to inclusion of the entire charge for medicines, &c., in 1879, a great portion of which was omitted in 1878. If this be excluded from both figures, they become Rs. 3,51,596 for 1878 and Rs. 3,46,845 for 1879. Even thus corrected the totals are of little value for comparison for reasons already given, which comparison can only be justly made after detailed examination of the several heads of charge in each hospital. 22. Medical College Hospital.CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 11 30. The miscellaneous charges in the College Hospital, as stated in the account, cannot be judged by comparison with former years. They stand at Rs. 11,576, against Rs. 13,733 in 1878. This year the sum of Rs. 3,564 has been excluded, as I have said, and deducted from the balance received from Government. The details in the report show that the true charge for miscellaneous items was higher than in 1878, whence I infer that the receipts from patients were balanced in that year by inclusion of the amount in this total. The cost of bandage cloth, for example, was considerably increased in 1879, and sundry items supplied by the Medical Store Department, including Rs. 332 for books and forms, which did not appear at all in 1878. The amount, viz. Rs. 11,576, is thus made up:12 REPORT ON THE 35. The charge for bazar medicines and hospital necessaries differed very little from that of the previous year. It appears high when compared with the College Hospital, but the comparison cannot be made without close adjustment of items between this and the miscellaneous heading. 36. The cost of English medicines was much smaller than it has ever been. With forms and books the total was Rs. 3,727-9-6, and this is, in Dr. Jones' opinion, "about what it will be in future," unless patients increase largely in number. In 1878 the cost, after deducting credits, was Rs. 4,579, and Rs. 11,473 in 1877, or perhaps Rs. 11,000 if credits were noticed. 37. Dieting charges amounted to Rs. 23,908, against Rs. 29,204 in 1878 and Rs. 48,954 in 1877. The average daily cost per patient was 7 annas and 10 pie, reckoned on the outlay for paying as well as pauper patients. 38. It will be observed that in this hospital reduction of numbers treated has led to reduction in cost of diet, while no such result has attended a fall in numbers at the Medical College. The reason, as regards numbers only, is doubtless this. The wards at the General Hospital are not always full. If numbers increase, more beds are occupied and more diets issued, and vice versâ. At the College the wards are said to be always full. The daily number fed is therefore neither more nor less, whether the total treated in the year rise or fall. A rise in total number will mean that patients have come and gone more rapidly, and a fall that they have stayed longer; but the diets will be affected only by those minor changes which the earlier and. the later days of illness dictate. 39. Miscellaneous charges for 1879 appear to advantage in the account. They include Rs. 71, the cost of registers and forms which in 1878 was taken with medical stores. The cost of lighting, which in 1877 was Rs. 5,054, fell in 1879 to Rs. 1,683. On clothing Rs. 261 were spent, and petty repairs were charged as miscellaneous to the amount of Rs. 180. 40. Work executed by the Department of Public Works cost Rs. 6,131 in 1879, against Rs. 5,263 in 1878. 41. Campbell Hospital.CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 13. fell the more heavily on 1879. Other miscellanies were less costly than before, with the exception of books and forms, the expenditure on which is included under this head. A sum of Rs. 394 is also included, having been expended from the "compound " fund after remittance to the treasury. For buildings and repairs the charge for 1879 exceeded that for 1878 by Rs. 3,657. It is evident that the increase of expenditure in this hospital was unavoidable. The Public Works charges alone showed a greater increment than the total charges. This was partly counterbalanced by reduction of those charges with which hospital management is chiefly concerned. 45. Police Hospital.14 REPORT ON THE The heavy charge is at once explained by reference to the indents of the Mayo Hospital and dispensaries and to the Medical Examiner's price list. The single item of out-patient tickets accounts for the greater part of the amount. Of these tickets there are returned as expended in a year no less than 96 thousand. Their price is Rs. 31-4 per thousand, and the total cost of the quantity was therefore Rs. 3,000. The price (six pie) for a small scrap of printed paper seems extravagant, and I propose to take steps at once, subject to the approval of Government, towards obtaining the tickets elsewhere and simplifying their form. The number used in the hospitals and dispensaries of the province is necessarily very large. The irregularities of charge for forms in the several institutions will be investigated shortly. They point to the possibility of considerable changes. 51. The exact cost of medicines and instruments in 1879 was Rs. 3,362. The cost for 1878 does not appear, as the Accountant-General includes it in one total with other charges of the Medical Store Department. This total presents correct excess of Rs. 690 over that of 1878. Bazar medicines also rose in cost from Rs. 1,793 in 1878 to Rs. 1,969 in 1879. Diets cost Rs. 5,611 in 1879, against Rs. 5,216 in 1878, though in-patients were fewer; and the average cost was 2 annas 8 pie, against 2 annas 2 pie, though market prices were lower. Miscellaneous charges in 1879 amount to Rs. 11,651, or Rs. 4,314 more than in 1878. They are laden with the cost of books, forms, and sundries from the Store Department, amounting to Rs. 3,245. The corresponding charge in 1878 was included in the estimate for English medicines. Buildings and repairs cost last year Rs. 3,159, against Rs. 7,983 in 1878. 52. Howrah General Hospital.CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 15 of this is obvious and well recognized by others who have to deal with this class of cases, but it differs widely from some of the clamorous statements that have lately been promulgated on the subject. 58. The subjoined statement has been prepared to show the number of sick treated daily in the several hospitals and the money spent in treating them, irrespective of outlay which is not connected with hospital administra- tion. The final column shows the total cost to Government, including all charges. To the best of my belief these figures are correct, subject only to additions in some institutions for printed papers obtained from the Stationery Office, which in others are received from the Medical Stores and charged here. No charge is entered in any hospital for stationery of any kind, as no accounts are received. STATEMENT NO. IX Showing the work and the cost of working in the several Medical Institutions.

The cost of the Police Hospital was much reduced in 1879, not- withstanding dietary and other improvements. The income is a fixed propor- tion paid by the Municipality and a small sum realised by sale of grass. 63. At the Mayo Hospital and its dependencies charges increased in all items affected by management. Income from private sources fell, and Government expenditure rose by additional cost of medical stores. 64. The Howrah Hospital shows reduced cost under all ordinary heads of charge. Income increased from all private sources except subscriptions, which fell. Government expenditure rose under a special grant for building, but was otherwise lower than before. 65. I append short summaries of the several reports according to custom, omitting many particulars which have already been presented. MEDICAL COLLEGE HOSPITAL. 66.Dr. D. B. Smith was in charge of this hospital during the year. Dr. W. J. Palmer left on furlough on 3rd April 1879, and Dr. McLeod was appointed to officiate as Second Surgeon. Dr. E. Lawrie, Resident Surgeon, left the hospital for a district appointment in March, and Dr. Mullen took the vacant place in May. Dr. S. B. Partridge retired from the service on 31st December. Dr. McLeod then became First Surgeon and Dr. D. Raye officiated as Second Surgeon. 67. The general death-rate of all races was 130 per 1,000, against 135, 108, 136, 152, and 125 in the preceding five years. Excluding moribunds the rate was 93 to compare with 111, 91, 103, 128, and 95. The comparison here is just; but if made with other hospitals, is subject to correction as shown in the body of the report. 68. Male European patients died at the rate of 57 per 1,000 treated, against 63 in 1878; females 39, against 55. Of Eurasians 79 males died per 1,000, against 59 in 1878, and 31 females against 80. Of natives 201 per 1,000 males, against 230 in 1878, and 129 females against 183. 69. Dr. Smith draws attention to the number of male Europeans treated as greatly reduced by the reception of nearly all seamen from the port into the General Hospital. The number in 1879 was 380 only, against 867 in the previous year. This made the general death-rate of the College Hospital appear higher in comparison than it really was in 1879. 70. The total number of medical and surgical out-door patients treated in 1879 was 74,318. The total number of new cases treated was 28,661, to compare with 27,083 in 1878. 71. The number of patients in the obstetric ward was slightly below that of 1878, but above those of the previous four years. The number of out-patients in this department was an usual one. 72. In the ophthalmic hospital and out-patient room also usual numbers were treated. 73. In the total out-patient practice of the hospital new patients treated in 1879 exceeded by upwards of 2,000 the number in 1878, and showed larger excess over the numbers of the four preceding years. 74.

Dr. Smith reports favourably of the services of Mr. R. F. Knight, formerly apothecary, and now steward of the hospital. PRESIDENCY GENERAL HOSPITAL. 78. Surgeon-Major Jones was in charge of this hospital throughout the year. 79. The total number of patients treated was 3,115, to compare with 4,164 in 1878. This is ascribed to the reduced number of seamen in port. The admissions from the shipping had been 2,748 in number in 1878, whereas in 1879 they were only 1,790. With the reception of nearly all sick seamen into this hospital in 1879, the decrease of seafaring population would have been scarcely sufficient to produce this large difference, if it had not been aided by the greater healthiness of the year. From the resident community there were 1,325 admissions in 1879, against 1,416 in 1878. Much attention was given during the year to the exclusion of trivial cases of illness which did not require indoor treatment, and to timely removal after recovery. The average daily number of sick in 1879 was 134, against 167 in the previous year, and of sailors 85, against 130. 80. The greater healthiness of the season is seen in the reduced admis- sions from fever in 1879, which numbered 944, against 1,347 in 1878. There were fewer cases of cholera than in any previous year, except 1871, of which only four were received from the town and 35 from the shipping, principally from the moorings at Hastings, Prinsep's Ghât, and the Esplanade. Dysentery and diarrh18 REPORT ON THE attacked with cholera had died in 1877 and 1878 at rates of 80.6 and 74.9 per cent. The death-rate in the Campbell Hospital in 1879 was 64.7 per cent. The death-rate from all disease was 260 per 1,000, against 253 in 1878. The difference between these two years is made up by the cholera mortality. If cases received from the depôt be excluded, the rate falls to 252 per 1,000. The difference on the former years is due to the additional prevalence of small-pox in 1879. Excluding cholera, small-pox, and moribund persons, the general death-rate in 1879 was 199 per 1,000. 86. Improvements.CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 19 96.

RESOLUTION. READ( 2 ) was so sudden and unexplained as to raise a doubt whether some change in the method of returning the patients was not effected in that year. It will be observed that, apart from the closing of the out-patient department of the General Hospital, it is again, in 1879, the fluctuations in the large figures of the Mayo Hospital, an institution under private management, which chiefly affect the returns. The number of patients receiving relief at the Medical College Hospital has been steadily increasing for the last three years. For some years before 1877 the figure had stood at about 49,000. 4. The total number of in-door patients treated was less in 1879 by 5,734 as compared with 1878, and by 1,793 as compared with 1877. It will be remembered that 1878 was a very unhealthy year, while in 1877 the public health was satisfactory. The lower figures in the Medical College Hospital, in the Mayo Hospital, in the Campbell Hospital, and in the Police Hospital, are entirely due to the generally favorable character of the past year. In the General Hospital they are attributable partly to the same cause, and partly to the more careful selection of cases for admission, but chiefly to the falling off in the shipping of the port and in the number of seamen requiring treat- ment. The number of seamen admitted to that hospital during each of the past four years was as follows:( 3 ) 7. The following table shows the general mortality in hospital and in the town during 1879 and the previous seven years:( 4 ) 9. The foregoing statement exhibits all the deaths, whether the patients were classed as moribund on admission or not. In previous years it was customary to class as " moribund " all patients who died within 24 hours of admission, and to make deductions from the total mortality on this account. Dr. Payne, however, holds that cholera deaths occurring within 24 hours of admission should not go to swell the numbers of so-called moribund cases. If cholera be excluded, the moribund cases are almost entirely native, and their effect should only be looked at with reference to the native death-rate. The result in 1879 is shown in the following table, the figures in which cannot unfortunately be compared, as regards totals, with those of former years, except in the case of the Medical College Hospital:( 5 ) the dead-house for post mortem examination, the facts prove, as the Surgeon- General argues, the magnitude of the error which in past years attributed all septicæmic deaths to the defective construction of the hospital. The advocates of antiseptic surgery claim for it that it prevents hospitalism almost entirely. The Lieutenant-Governor hopes that in future reports the experience of the Surgeons of the Medical College Hospital, in connection with this question, will be brought out and examined by the Surgeon-General so as to be on record in an easily accessible form. Meantime an examination of the statistics given in the appendix and in former reports brings out the following facts, which were certainly, in the Lieutenant-Governor's opinion, deserving of some detailed examination:( 6 ) were admitted for blindness or absolutely incurable conditions, and the orders of Government restricting the number of patients to 467 (subject to certain exceptions) were attended to as far as possible, there were at one time 508 persons under treatment. There are still many incurable cases of old standing in the wards. Of the 32 European deaths, 12 were caused by small-pox, 10 by dysentery and diarrh( 7 ) The returns for 1879 are, Dr. Payne observes, silent as to the "acute ( 8 ) Native and European, they will be reconsidered; but at present there is no reason to believe that they are not sufficient to provide this. The Lieutenant- Governor would also wish to see the cooking for the European patients improved at this hospital. 22. At the General Hospital the expenditure on establishment, though less than in 1878, is still high for the number of patients. But as these are all Europeans, some excess might be expected. The average daily cost of each diet at the General Hospital was 7 annas 10 pies reckoned on both paying and pauper patients. The expenditure on medicines and miscellaneous items was less than in 1878. This hospital in every department shows the good results of careful management and personal administrative supervision. 23. In the Campbell Hospital the establishment was increased to provide proper attendance in the European small-pox wards. There was a trifling increase in the cost of native diets, the daily average being 2 annas 7.3 pies against 2 annas 6 pies in 1878. The total charge for diets was Rs. 24,086, against Rs. 31,348 in 1877, for a much smaller number of patients. 24. In the Police Hospital the general cost was reduced, though the diet scale was increased. The average daily cost of each diet was 2 annas 9 pies, a fact which shows that the College Hospital rates are not unduly low. Every policeman unfit for duty, however trivial or temporary his ailment, is admitted to the Police Hospital. The number of full diets must therefore be greater in proportion than in any other institution. Moreover, many of the men were found to be suffering only from under-feeding and parsimonious living common among up-countrymen of their class. These patients had of course to be fed up. Yet the average cost of diets in the Police Hospital is perceptibly less than in the College Hospital, where the proportionate number of low and reduced diets in serious cases is far greater. 25. The charges of the Mayo Hospital and its dependencies in respect of establishment and manaement rose somewhat. European subscriptions and other donations showed a large falling off, and the Government expenditure on medical stores increased. The Surgeon-General draws attention to the heavy charges made in the case of this and other institutions by the Medical Store Department for out-patient tickets. Steps should, as suggested, be taken by the Surgeon-General, in communication with the Superintendent of Government Printing, for having them more cheaply printed. If this is done, the Lieutenant- Governor thinks that it would probably simplify the accounts of the Mayo Hospital, and place matters on a more satisfactory footing, if Government made it an annual money grant on account of its medicines, instruments, and forms; the hospital receiving these on payable indent as other aided institutions now do, or providing itself with them from England direct. The Surgeon-General is requested to consider what the amount of such a grant should be, and to place himself in communication with the governing body of the hospital, in view to arranging this matter on an equitable basis. The average daily cost of each native diet in this hospital was 2 annas 8 pies, or less than in the College Hospital, yet no complaints have ever been made of the insufficiency of the scale. 26. The Government expenditure on the Howrah Hospital during the year was increased by a special building grant. The income from paying patients and the municipality rose slightly, but private subscriptions fell off considerably. The total expenditure on diets was Rs. 5,498, against Rs. 10,585 in 1878. It was discovered in 1870 that a fraudulent system of treating the diet-roll had been going on, in which the cashier, the diet-roll clerk, and the sircar were concerned. Proper checks have now been applied. The average daily cost of each European diet in 1879 was 7 annas 4 pies against 9 annas 4 pies in 1878. The cost of native diets was the same in both years, viz. 1 anna 7 pies. The Surgeon- General personally inquired into the causes of the very low diet rate for natives at the Howrah Hospital, and found that it was accounted for by the large number of moribund cases admitted when too far gone to swallow anything. To press such patients with food or stimulants would, as the Assistant Surgeon in charge explained, cause only needless distress. The Civil Surgeon must, however, see that patients who are able to take food are allowed to want nothing which their cases require.

The number of children treated was small, and the adult death-rate was not much exceeded by the general rate in consequence, but it was affected in some degree. In the Campbell Hospital the adult death-rate was 234 per thousand, and that of children 150. This difference would be expected from the condition of adults received into this hospital. The children brought the general death-rate to 230.8. Being few in number, the effect of their smaller mortality on the general rate was not great. In the Mayo Hospital adults died at the rate of 142 per thousand, and children at the rate of 155. The effect on the general rates was insignificant from the numbers. At Howrah children died at the rate of 214 per thousand, but the entire number was again too small to affect the total proportion. The general death-rate among adults in all the hospitals was 138.6 per thousand, that of children 133. The total death-rate given in the table is 138.17, and the fractional difference is now explained. At the same time it is made clear that the large number of children entered in the second statement were almost all of them treated as out-patients. 8. Some marked differences in the death-rates of male and female adults will probably attract attention. The hospitals chiefly concerned are the Campbell and Howrah Hospitals, which resemble each other in receiving large number of wandering destitute people in the extremity of illness, among whom males largely predominate.

19,340 19,225 57 13 13 32 12 REPORT ON THE 12. I would again point out that this table does not exhibit the relation in which death stands to surgical operation. It has nothing in common with tables of medical statistics compiled for the purpose of showing results of disease. The same operation which in one case is performed with some certainty of success, is in others adopted only in the last resort. One surgeon will operate in a case which another would not touch. A young surgeon, full of incisive impulse, will show a long list of operations and of deaths, which. latter, following the former in a printed form, are ascribed to them as effects to causes. An older practitioner withholds his knife unless he sees fair probability of good results. He shows fewer operations and much fewer deaths; yet if the facts were elicited, it would be seen that the disease, or the condition which was the true cause of death, had been as fatal: in. the hands of one as of the other. Operation, as I have said, is a process of treatment, not a disease, and the method of examining the merits of treatment is something very different from the inspection of tabulated sequences. 13. The above remarks are enough. to show how largely such. tables as this must be made up of incidental things, and how impossible it is to trace in them the relation of surgical operation to. death, to obtain. from them. any information concerning cases in which it may be supposed that operation has caused death which, without it, would not have occurred, or even to follow the particular manner or form of death. So much has this been. felt by surgeons in Europe, who have charged themselves with the investigation of surgical mortality, that high authority has been driven to select a small group of operations as a test of comparative practice, to the exclusion of all others. 14. In his resolution on the report for 1879, the Lieutenant-Governor commented unfavourably on the fact that the figured results of surgical opera- tions for six consecutive years had not been examined, and the increase of surgical mortality in 1879 over the previous year, shown by the figures, had not been considered. The foregoing remarks will, I trust, suffice to show the impossibility of examination when there was no knowledge. besides that which crude figures afford. If the subject bad been treated in former years in particular reports with as much detail as is to be found this year in the reports from the Medical College, I might, by delaying and. greatly extending my own report, have produced a full technical account of the course of events. For this I had not the necessary materials, and I regret now that I did not explain more fully my grounds for rejecting mere figures as fallacious, and as affording not even so much as material for examination. 15. So far as it is the object of Government to obtain a measure of recent progress with special reference to hospitalism, the best contribution which I can make to its fulfilment will be made if I follow the method of Sir J. Simpson, and, selecting a few test operations, trace their results through consecutive. years. This method, adopted for comparison of surgical success in different countries and institutions, will succeed and fail in similar degrees when applied to the same institution in different years, in estimation of the effects of altered practice. Sir J. Simpson chose for his purpose amputations through the thigh, leg, arm, and forearm, as least beset with confusing incidents, and particularly liable to be followed by septic affections. The following figures show the death-rates after these operations through a series of years in the Calcutta hospitals:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 13 16. If on these figures the results of 1879 be examined, they will be found unfavourable when compared with the previous year, but not nearly so unfavourable as they appear in the general table, nor so unfavourable as to disturb the inference of great improvement on earlier years. They may indeed be regarded as quite within the range of natural fluctuation, even when events are tending in one direction only. The great variations in the table, when circumstances are apparently similar, is itself no mean proof of the number and magnitude of causes and influences which are not tabulated. The inherent defects of figures are obvious, such as comparison of dissimilar numbers, disproportionate effect of small numbers on ratios, &c. These are inseparable from all tables; but in this one the technical sources of error are so many that the bare enumeration of them would form a long paragraph, which would take the dimensions of a treatise if I should attempt to dis- entangle any particular thread of causation. I must indeed for such a purpose analyse every case in every hospital, and spend more time in doing it than the clinical clerk had spent in making his record. 17. It is in connection with the Medical College Hospital that the sub- ject of septic disease has assumed a public character here, and though the events and researches of the last few years may fairly be considered to have set that question at rest, I gather from the last resolution that the Lieutenant- Governor still wishes the events of succeeding years to be considered with reference to it. I subjoin therefore a table similar in form to the last, but relating only to the working of the College Hospital. STATEMENT No. IX. THIGH. LEG. ARMS. FOREARM. Operations. Deaths. Deaths per mille.

Here again extravagant anomalies appear in the figures. In 1880 the most fatal operations were performed with a success which would not have been credible ten years ago, whereas less dangerous operations were unusually fatal. Those who remember the earlier days of this hospital will remember that the case of a man whose leg had been amputated through the thigh was regarded as almost desperate then. In 1880 the mortality after this operation was the lowest in the group. If we get rid of variations and contrasts by the ordinary method of absorption in an average we shall have the following death-rates on the whole group of operations in the last three years:14 REPORT ON THE 1875. These results are indicative of three different modes of treatment. The earliest period represents the treatment adopted prior to the introduction of Esmarch's bloodless apparatus. Between 1875 and 1879 this apparatus was used, and in the course of 1880 Lister's antiseptic treatment was added in its entirety. This system was adopted in the First Surgeon's ward, the Second Surgeon treating his cases in the style that was successful between 1876 and 1878. 21. The First Surgeon had 26 operations, nine of which were treated on the old method and 17 by the antiseptic system. Of the former group (all treated to their end) one died, and of the latter (of which 11 only were treated to a termination) two died, " giving a mortality in the antiseptic cases of 18 per cent.," and in the former it would appear of 11 per cent. only. The Second Surgeon had 16 operations with three deaths among 14 cases treated to the end, giving a death-rate of 21 per cent. The strict antiseptic system com- pared with the results of the five years, viz. 1875 to 1879, when modified antiseptics were used, represents a mortality in excess of the latter by 3.72 per cent. Dr. Coates adds: " It has been urged in support of Lister's system in the treatment of these cases, that it reduces the death-rate, obviates putrefactive changes in the wound, and septic contamination of the system; that it sup- presses all constitutional disturbance, and materially accelerates healing, thereby contracting the period of treatment. It thus counterbalances by saving in the patient's diet the expense which the system entails." The following facts bear upon the last point. The average weight of the tumours removed in former years was 142 ounces, and the patients were under treatment on an average 90 days. The average weight in 1880 was 60 ounces, and the average period was 72 days There is no evidence of shortened duration here, and on the whole I think but little advantage can at present be claimed for Lister's system in this class of cases. In the special report appended, Dr. McLeod points out that the wounds after scrotal operation are with great difficulty kept in an aseptic state, being particularly prone to become the nidus of septic infection. This is quite intelligible, and it may be wrong to estimate the general value of the system by so severe a test; but if it should appear that in these same difficult cases results as good or better are obtainable by the former system, the difficulty will not save the credit of strict Listerism; but the generally better results of late years will point rather to those collateral improvements which Dr. Raye shows to have accompanied antiseptic practiceCALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 15 23. The number of minor surgical operations performed by the Resident Surgeon in 1880 was 5,802. In 1879 it had been 4,694. The difference is ascribed to increased attendance of out-patients, attracted by the new dispen- sary. I observe, however, that in 1878 the Resident Surgeon performed 6,197 operations and 5,585 in 1877. Some of these would have been included in the list of more important operations if they had been performed in the wards, to which indeed they were admitted for subsequent treatment. 24. Dr. Coates gives the following account of the opening of the new dispensary:16 REPORT ON THE with 6,054 in 1879. The average daily attendance was 85.9, which in 1879 was 80.7. Of the new cases 3,879 were male and 1,587 female adults. There were 846 children. There were 166 surgical operations performed upon these people. 27. I have introduced the foregoing accounts of the Obstetric and Ophthal- mic Hospitals into the body of this report, instead of giving them the place they formerly occupied in the notice of the Medical College Hospital, abstracted from the hospital returns, as they are institutions entirely devoted to these branches of practice, and so may be regarded as the special hospitals of Calcutta. 28. In the resolution on the report for 1879, the Lieutenant-Governor expressed a hope that in future reports the experience of the surgeons of the Medical College Hospital would be brought out and examined by the Surgeon- General in connection with the question of antiseptic surgery. I can only respond to the Lieutenant-Governor's wish by producing the reports which I have received from the officers mentioned, which I do in appendix, or rather so much of the reports as relates to the experience indicated. The subject at the present time divides the opinions of the highest authorities, and the conclusions conveyed in these reports represent two aspects of the question. I am not competent to pronounce judgment in a case in which the best judges differ; and I could not attempt a critical examination of the views expressed in the reports unless I had accompanied the reporters in their daily practice. I have already shown the position in which, in my judgment, the question of antiseptic surgery stands at present, on the evidence of the few facts brought out in the hospital by the practice of the year, and have made reference to some points in the special reports which bear on the argument and on hospital management. For the rest, I will content myself with leaving each surgeon to relate his experience and his opinions in his own words, observing only that Listerism, in its introduction here, has been accompanied by great improvements in matters of ordinary hospital administration, and that hereafter, when there shall have been experience sufficient for the due consideration of its merits, it will be necessary to keep other powerful influences in view. 29.

The "special allowance" from Government exhibits expenditure minus the amount received from paying-patients and from Port Dues, which is remitted to the Treasury. The entry of the amount remitted to Treasury to the credit of Government is nowhere recorded for want of a special column for the purpose. In the hospital accounts this amount is erroneously added to the expenditure under the head of "Miscellaneous charges," to make the cash balance correspond. From the special allowance therefore this amount is deducted in this office, which obviates the necessity of enhancing the apparent expenditure. The charges shown in the cash account under the head of "Income from Government," represent consequently the net cost to Govern- ment. The entire outlay to Government amounted to Rs. 97,829 against Rs. 94,933 in 1879. 37. The sum of Rs. 3,443 was received on account of interest on invested capital, of which Rs. 834 was expended for the relief of the sick-poor dis- charged from the hospital. The balance of this, together with the cash balance remaining on 1st January, enabled the Principal to invest in the name of the different funds the sum of Rs. 5,000, leaving a balance of Rs. 2,767 in hand at the end of the year. 38. The cost of establishment was Rs. 41,106 against Rs. 42,342, or Rs. 1,236 less than that of 1879. The salaries of the Professors of the College are as usual met from the budget allotments of the Educational Department. In the Choonee Lall Seal's Dispensary the establishment proper cost Rs. 274 for six months. 39. The cost of bazar medicines expended at the hospital and dispensary amounted to Rs. 1,194, or Rs. 89 in excess of that of 1879. The increase in the number of out-patients treated accounts for the difference, 40. The cost of Europe medicines in the Medical College Hospital amounted to Rs. 9,083, and Rs. 2,537 was expended for medical stores for the Choonee Lall Seal's Dispensary. From July all out-patients attending the College Hospital were treated from the stock of medicines of this dispensary. Taking both the amounts together, there was a total expenditure of Rs. 11,620 against Rs. 13,082 in 1879. The last figure differs from the figure given in the last report, which was that for the official year. New instruments had to be purchased for the first time for the dispensary. The supply obtained was for a year's consumption, which points being considered with the larger attendance of patients, shows the expenditure on medical stores in 1880 to have been proportionally much less than that of 1879. 41. The registers and forms used in the hospital are adapted to special purposes, with the exception of certain general medical forms, the cost of which, as far as can be ascertained, was Rs. 12. These special forms vary somewhat in heading, but not in the particulars they record. Nevertheless, in every case the forms had to be separately printed. The price of these forms is not known, and the cash accounts do not include their value. The supply of forms is now obtained solely from the Stationery Department, but the price of them has not yet been determined. Consequently the charges cannot be included in this report. 42. The total cost of European and native diets in the Hospital and Eye infirmary, including stimulants and extras, was Rs. 29,753 against Rs. 30,884 in 1879. The cost of stimulants, both for Christians and Natives, was Rs. 531 against Rs. 806 in 1879, and Rs. 814, Rs. 3,530, and Rs. 4,607 in 1878, 1877, and 1876 respectively. The average cost of all was six annas six pies for Europeans and two annas ten pies for natives. In the Mayo Hospital the average cost for natives was two annas eleven pies. The difference is trivial. An increase of one and a half ounces of rice, half an ounce dâll, quarter of an ounce ghee, half an ounce barley, and a quarter of an ounce mussalas, &c., was made during the year to the full, half, and chicken diets to give increased variety to the cooking of the meals of the European patients. Regarding the quality of the diets supplied, and the outside diets brought into the hospital, I invite attention to the remarks of Dr. Coates, published in the abstract of the report of the hospital. 43. The miscellaneous charges of the hospital amounted to Rs. 9,915 against Rs. 11,576 in 1879. Among these charges the sum of Rs. 834 was expended from interest on invested funds against Rs. 2,311 in 1879. Besides
20 REPORT ON THE this, the charges consist of lighting, which cost Rs. 1,646; cloth for bandages Rs. 2,494; contingencies, including coal for boiler and ice, Rs. 1,345; clothing Rs. 2,913; and burning and burying charges Rs. 667. In 1879 the charges under these heads were Rs. 1,537, Rs. 2,178, Rs. 1,918, Rs. 1,857 and Rs. 774 respectively. In the Choonee Lall Seal's Dispensary the amount expended was Rs. 356. 44. Rs. 10,872 were expended on quadrennial and petty repairs to the building against Rs. 2,887 in 1879. 45. Presidency General Hospital.CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 21 54. The total expenditure was Rs. 69,296 against Rs. 69,132. The establishment charges show a reduction of Rs 413 on 1879, Dieting articles, including stimulants and extras, cost Rs. 24,363 against Rs. 24,086, the increase being chiefly due to the issue of a larger quantity of extra food and stimulants to the patients of the surgical wards, as a larger number of severe accidents, requiring primary amputations, were admitted during the year. The average cost of each patient during the year was Re. 0-2-7.6 against As. 2-7.3 in 1879, As. 2-6 in 1878, and As. 3-8 in 1877. Bazar medicines cost Rs. 483 more than that of 1879. Of this amount, Rs. 79 represented increase on account of country medicines, ascribed to the increased daily average sick treated in 1880. This increase, however, was nominal, and Rs. 404 were expended in hospital necessaries, such as dressing and bandage cloth on account of a larger number of major operations performed in the hospital. Several unserviceable articles had also to be replaced. 55. The cost of Europe medicines was Rs 3,170 against Rs. 2,482. No explanation has been offered on this. The figure reported for 1879, which was Rs. 2,290, was not correct. The correct information now available in my office was then wanting, and considerable difficulty was experienced in obtaining an exact statement of the value of medical stores. In 1879 only one indent was submitted, doubtless because of accumulated stores. 56. Miscellaneous items showed an expenditure of Rs 6,610 against Rs. 7,323 in 1879. Registers and forms cost Rs. 48 against Rs. 97 in 1879. Here the true cost of printed papers cannot yet be given. Clothing cost Rs. 2,842 against Rs. 2,340. Rs. 628 were expended from the "Compound" fund, and included here. Here again the receipts are included in the expendi- ture under the head of "Miscellaneous charges" for adjustment of the cash balance. This has, however, been rectified in my office by excluding the amount from expenditure, and making a corresponding deduction of the credits from the special allowances paid by Government, which left the balance unaffected. 57.

Of the special Government grant (Rs. 7,000) Rs. 5,688 were expended on medical stores, the balance (Rs. 1,312) is reserved for the first quarter of the current year. Dieting articles cost Rs. 5,849 against Rs. 5,611 in 1879. The daily average sick treated exceeded by one only the corresponding figure of 1879. The average cost of each diet was two annas eleven pies against two annas eight pies in 1879. Miscellaneous charges were less by Rs. 4,452 than those of 1879.

There were only 21 cases of cholera admitted, being the lowest number on record since 1864, and the number of deaths was 13 against 25 in 1879, and is also the lowest recorded mortality since 1864. There were 17 cases amongst seamen, and the largest number of cases (six) as usual came from the Hastings moorings. Phthisis, which is a very important factor in the causation of mortality at this hospital, caused 17 deaths in 76 cases treated in 1880. Dysentery caused three deaths in 178 cases, against 200 cases and 13 deaths in 1879. Diarrh26 REPORT ON THE brought in a moribund condition, and died within 24 hours.

The total number of deaths was 30 in 1880, against 36 in 1879 and 31 in 1878, and the death-rate to admissions was 11.4 per 1,000 against 13.9 in 1879. The deaths to total strength of the Police force were 1.06 per cent. against 1.27 in 1879. 86. Improvement.CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 27 96. The aggregate sickness and mortality in the Europeans and Natives are shown in the following table:APPENDIX I. Report by the First Surgeon, Medical College Hospital, on Antiseptic Surgery. THE number and varieties of septic diseases treated during the year were as follow:ii 7. It is difficult from bare figures to prove absolute reduction of mortality in operative surgery. So many circumstances, which cannot be represented arithmetically, enter into the question. In 1879 I find that the mortality of operations in the Second Surgeon's ward, of which I was in charge for nine months, was 18 per cent. In 1880 the mortality of operations similarly tabulated in the First Surgeon's ward has been about 10 per cent. I attribute the reduction to the more careful and successful practice of antiseptic surgery. The operations were not less severe, nor the circumstances demanding them less serious, in the one period than in the other. The statistics of particular operations support the general conclusion: 13 amputations, including four of the thigh, two of the shoulder joint, three of the arm, two of the leg, one of the forearm, and one of the hand,iii APPENDIX II. Report by the Second Surgeon, Medical College Hospital, on Antiseptic Surgery. I USE the word septicæmia in its fullest sense, including pyæmia proper, and even the mildest forms of erysipelas. By antiseptics I mean the method of dressing wounds introduced by Professor Lister, and mainly consisting of a free use of carbolic acid in various ways. Using the word antiseptics in this full sense, I should mention that I have not employed them indiscriminately in all cases, but only for the more severe operations, such as amputations, hernias, and large chronic abscesses, &c. For minor cases I used the ordinary and less elaborate dressings commonly employed in surgery, partly because I did not consider antiseptics needed in such cases, partly also because the cases in the wards being utilised for teaching purposes, I thought it desirable that the students should learn the more simple methods, and not imagine that no wound would heal without antiseptics, and with the object of impressing upon their attention that manipulative skill and cleanliness were in reality all that was necessary in most cases to secure perfect results. The practical inculcat- ing of such a doctrine is, I consider, of great importance amongst students whose practice will hereafter be amongst people unable to give such large fees as would secure the, to them, somewhat expensive appliances necessary for carrying out Listerism in every-day work. The number of cases of septic poisoning, mild and severe, treated has been considerable; and, were I to attend merely to figures, I could not say that in my hands antiseptics have been very successful, but figures notwithstanding, I think I may safely state the following opinions:iv in an annual return as having suffered from septic poisoning.

A part of the increase at the Medical College Hospital was doubtless due to the opening of the new out-door dispensary on 1st July. The general death-rate at the Calcutta hospitals was 134.17 per mille against 155.62 in 1879. If the Howrah figures are included, the rate was 138.17 against 162.2. A decrease is shown at all except the Mayo hospital, where the rate rose from 139.36 to 143.19. 3. The figures showing the races and sexes of the persons treated in the different years are of little value for the purposes of comparison. The native races appear to resort to the hospitals in much the same proportion year after year. The proportion of male to female adults is about 4 to 1. Out of 163,925 adult males treated 15,584, and out of 40,563 adult females 4,298, were in-patients. Only 1,069 children out of 68,537 were treated in hospital. The death-rate among adults was 138.6, and among children only 133; but the number of the latter was so small that the general death-rate is only reduced to 138.17. 4. The following table shows the mortality in the hospitals during each of the past eight years:( 3 ) 136 in 1876, 152 in 1875, and 125 in 1874. Though there was an increase in the number of persons treated in the European wards, there was a decrease in the purely European element, the sailors from the port resorting chiefly to the General Hospital during the year. The increase took place among the more weakly classes of East Indians, Chinese, Jews, and Armenians, and the death-rate was doubtless less favourable in consequence than it would otherwise have been. The native death-rate of 195.15 is calculated on all cases. If moribund and cholera cases are excluded, the native death-rate was 149.55 against 140.6 in the previous year. It is stated that the native death-rate was affected by the circumstance that fewer pauper patients could be transferred to the Campbell Hospital owing to want of accommodation. The number transferred was only 537 against 902 in the previous year. Of the 588 persons who died, 69 were children. The children died at the same rate as the adults. Of the 169 deaths among Europeans, 22 were caused by fever, 14 by phthisis, 13 by diseases of the respiratory organs, 11 by dysentery, and 11 by diarrh( 4 ) 10. In the Howrah Hospital 612 Europeans and East Indians, and 945 natives, were treated, against 594 and 1,176 respectively. Of 56 children treated, 12 died; the rate was thus 214 per mile. The death-rate among adults was 186. The general rate was thus raised to 188. The death-rate among the European class was 29 against 53 in 1879, 55 in 1878, and 39 in 1877. Among natives the death-rate was 292, against 332, 346, and 252 respectively in the three previous years. More than one-fifth of the deaths among native patients occurred during the first 24 hours after admission. It is notorious that coolies from the interior, who have been employed in the mills and workshops at Howrah, generally go to the hospital only in the last extremity. If cholera and moribund cases are excluded, the death-rate is reduced to 243 in 1880 and 287 in 1879. Of the 18 Europeans and Eurasians 4 died of cholera, 3 of phthisis, and 3 of dysentery. Among natives 33 died of fever out of 202, 18 of cholera out of 29, 8 of dropsy out of 22; 53 of dysentery out of 111, 101 of diarrh( 5 ) affection is clearly established. Whether that decrease has or has not resulted from the employment of Professor Lister's system proper is not so clear. Dr. McLeod treated to conclusion 20 cases of scrotal tumour( 6 ) have been no cases since 1876, and in the Campbell Hospital none since 1874. There was no enteric fever in the Medical College Hospital. There were 2 cases in 1879, and from 1871 to 1877 cases were regularly recorded. It is doubtful if these were all really cases of enteric fever. 16. The use of the cinchona febrifuge in substitution for quinine con- tinues to increase. Of the former, 161lbs and of the latter 19lbs were used. In 1876 the proportions were 1lb and 195lbs respectively, and in 1877 47lbs and 101lbs. The value of the febrifuge has now been definitely established, and the public demand for it is increasing daily. 17. With reference to paragraph 31 of his report, the Surgeon-General should inform the officer in charge that it is not desirable that any experi- ments to test the fuller efficacy of Dr. MacCormac's prophylactic against cholera should be made in the hospitals. Attention can best be confined to the treatment of existing disease. The object of the Secretary of State in forwarding Dr. MacCormac's letters to the Government of India was merely that all medical officers might be made aware of the fact that in the year 1854 fifty cases of cholera occurred in a public institution in Belfast, that a mixture of dilute sulphuric acid and peppermint was administered to all the inmates as a prophylactic, and that the cessation of the outbreak was synchronous with the dosing of the establishment. This circumstance has been made known to all medical officers under this Government; and nothing further is required. The Surgeon-General very correctly remarks that the administration of sulphuric acid to persons under treatment for other diseases might be open to serious objection. 18. The total expenditure at the Medical College Hospital was Rs. 1,06,750 against Rs. 1,01,453 in 1879. The former sum, however, includes a charge of Rs. 10,872 for repairs, while the expenditure under this head in 1879 was only Rs. 2,887. The charge for medicines was reduced by the transfer of the out- patients to the Choonee Lal Seal Dispensary in the second-half of the year. The amount expended from the funds of the dispensary on this account was Rs. 2,712. The total cost of diets was Rs. 29,753 against Rs. 30,884 in 1879. In 1875 the cost was Rs. 48,209, and in 1876 it was Rs. 46,303. The average cost of diet, calculated on the number who actually consumed it, was 6 annas 6 pie for Europeans and 2 annas 10 pie for natives. The cost in 1879 was 6 annas 7½ pie and 3 annas 1 pie respectively. In the Mayo Hospital the average cost of native diets during the year was 2 annas 11 pie. The cost of stimulants was Rs. 531 against Rs. 806 in 1879, Rs. 814 in 1878, Rs. 3,530 in 1877, Rs. 4,607 in 1876, and Rs. 6,488 in 1875. Dr. Coates reports thus: "We have plenty of money to spare for any and everything required in the way of necessaries and delicacies, and we do not hesitate to spend freely in such cases. Every item that every officer has ordered for his patients has been supplied without question or enquiry; interference was not needed. The many lady visitors to the hospital, the various clergymen and scripture-readers, and the friends of the sick who stream into the hospital at all hours and converse freely and separately with the inmates, have in no one instance brought to our notice any deficiency or inferiority in the quality of the food and comforts given to the patients throughout the year." Arrange- ments have been made to secure unadulterated milk for the patients. It is quite clear that the existing rates are ample to secure a sufficient supply of whole- some food and stimulants for the patients. The Lieutenant-Governor remarked in the resolution on the last report that the funds of the special endowments should be fully utilized for the benefit of the poor patients discharged from the hospital. It is not stated why the disbursements from these funds only amounted to Rs. 834 in 1880 against Rs. 2,311 in 1879. The actual cost of the hospital to Government, exclusive of the salaries of the medical officers who are Professors of the College, was Rs. 97,829 against Rs. 94,933 in 1879. The expenditure in the Choonee Lal Seal Dispensary was Rs. 3,342. The income from the endow- ment is about Rs. 2,000. The excess of expenditure over income was met from the cash balance that had accumulated. The Lieutenant-Governor is informed that there was a good deal of initial expenditure on instruments and the like that need not be repeated. 19. The total expenditure at the General Hospital was Rs. 1,02,352 against Rs. 94,664 in 1879. The increase was chiefly the result of the increase in the
( 7 ) daily average number of sick from 134 to 152. It was also found necessary to replace the old stock of clothing during the year. The receipts from paying- patients and from the Port Hospital Fund on account of seamen treated in the hospital amounted to Rs. 65,168 against Rs. 61,241 in 1879. The net cost to Government was Rs. 37,183 against Rs. 33,422. There was an increase in the expenditure on diet and stimulants from Rs. 23,908 in 1879 to Rs. 28,417; but the average was practically the same in both years, 7 annas 11 pie in 1880 and 7 annas 10 pie in 1879. The average expenditure on European medicines for the year was Rs. 34 against Rs. 80 in 1879. It is explained, however, that there was a considerable quantity of medicines in store at the beginning of 1879. 20. In the Campbell Hospital the expenditure of the year was Rs. 69,296 against Rs. 69,132 in 1879. Of this, Government contributed Rs. 37,562 and the Calcutta Municipality Rs. 30,000. Petty receipts from paying patients, the Port Hospital Fund, sale of grass, &c., aggregated Rs. 1,733. There was some increase in the expenditure on extras and stimulants, owing to the number of cases of severe accidents admitted during the year. The average cost of European diets was 7 annas 9 pie, 2 pie less than at the General Hospital. The average cost of each patient during the year was 2 annas 7.6 pie against 2 annas 7.3 pie in 1879, 2 annas 6 pie in 1878, and 3 annas 8 pie in 1877. There was an increase in the cost of European medicines, but it appears that here, as at the General Hospital, the wants of the hospital in 1879 were to some extent supplied from the surplus stock of the previous year. 21. The Mayo Hospital shows a reduction in gross expenditure from Rs. 59,774 to Rs. 55,159 and the Governors were able to add Rs. 2,500 to their vested capital of the Institution, while retaining a floating balance of Rs. 3,515 at the close of the year. The contribution from Government was Rs. 37,370, inclusive, of Rs. 7,000 which the Lieutenant-Governor has, with the concurrence of the Governors, fixed as the annual grant to represent the value of medicines and forms previously supplied. 22. The Howrah Hospital opened the year with a cash balance of Rs. 13,191. The income of the year, Rs. 40,413, was made up Rs. 8,650 from Government, Rs. 2,929 from Municipal Funds, Rs. 875 from interest on invest- ments, Rs. 27,447 subscriptions from Europeans, chiefly from the East Indian Railway Company, British Indian Steam Navigation Company, Limited, and the manufacturing companies of the neighbourhood, and. Rs. 512 subscriptions from natives. The hospital expenditure was Rs. 34,950 against Rs. 28,434 in the pre- vious year. Investments to the amount of Rs. 17,251 were made, and the year closed with a cash balance of Rs. 1,403. There was an unexplained increase of Rs. 616 in the expenditure on European medicines, and the charges for diet were higher by Rs. 497 than in 1879. The average cost of European diets was 7 annas 11 pie,( 8 ) because a check was placed upon wasteful expenditure, may be seen from the following figures. The year 1877 is omitted as it was one of transition:( 9 ) No. 650.

REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS FOR THE YEAR 1881. No. 3249. FROM A.J.PAYNE, ESQ., M.D., Surgeon-General for Bengal, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL, MUNICIPAL AND MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. Calcutta, the 18th April 1882. SIR, I HAVE the honour of reporting as follows on the state of the Medical Institutions of Calcutta in the year 1881. The condition of the town itself, in respect of the most prevalent diseases, is shown in the subjoined table:2 REPORT ON THE homes in the interior. The fever figures are more vitiated by this habit than those of any other disease, and though comparison of ordinary years in series, one with another, may hold good, it is quite certain that, in any single year, a large accession of fatal fever may occur without affecting the death records of the town. Whether such accession did or did not take place in 1881 cannot, therefore, be learnt from the aggregate numbers of the above table. Some indi- cation may be obtained from separate scrutiny of death lists in those town sections which are known to contain the largest proportions of fixed residents, and from fever mortality among married women and children, who represent fixed households. The evidence of the hospitals in 1881 is at variance with that of the general town record, for although the entire number of fever cases treated was considerably less than in 1880, chiefly from want of space in the Campbell Hospital, the actual number of deaths was larger, and the death-rate consider- ably higher, than in the preceding year. A true record of deaths caused in the town would probably show no variance with the hospital figures. It is at present probable that there was more fatal fever in Calcutta than before, but nothing at all resembling its prevalence in the districts epidemically affected. STATEMENT No. I.

In 1881, moreover, the Mayo Hospital showed an increase over 1880 nearly as large as was shown in 1880 over 1879, and much larger than the increase at the Medical College. 6. The total number of new cases treated as out-patients at the Medical College in the medical and surgical dispensaries, was 26,363 in 1881. Of these 15,219 were medical and 11,144 surgical cases. In addition to these 13,752 persons were treated in the admission room, and 4,198 in the consulting room. 7.

In the Medical College Hospital the death-rate of mixed adults was 134.4 per mile, that of children 92.4, which reduced the combined rate to 129.8. At the General Hospital the adult rate was 46.4; that of children 69 per mile. The small numbers of children have raised the death-rate only 1.4 per mile. At the Campbell Hospital adults died at the rate of 243.3 per mile and children at the rate of 102.3, reducing the combined rate to 237.4. At the Mayo Hospital the adult death-rate was 152.7; that of children 179. Here again the small numbers produced but little effect on the combined death-rate. At Howrah there was the same insignificance of total numbers. The adult rate here was 194.8; that of children 125, which somewhat reduced the combined rate.

The Committee proceeded to enquire how the hospital had acquired its bad repute, and found that it was due to the fact that the conditions known as "hospitalism" had never been absent from the place, and, as no other cause could be found for this, it was laid upon the con- struction of the hospital. The construction had not been in accordance with the latest doctrines in one respect. Its wards, or rather the lofty, spacious halls, which the patients occupy, were built with one end, and not with the broad- side, to the wind. The hospital had been therefore condemned as causing the death of many surgical patients, who were supposed to have come from the midst of filth from inhaling miasms and stenches of every kind, to be poisoned by the air of a palace, in which each man occupied more space than a large family of his class would have in their close damp hut at home. It would have been no matter for surprise if a large majority of the natives received into the College Hospital had been unable to bear operation, but facts proved the contrary of this. The enquiry was very minute. Operations in general, and test cases in particular, showed that "statistics of the hospital had com- pared very favourably with the results of English and foreign practice;" and the Committee, after giving exact figures, observed:10 REPORT ON THE needed. At the same time an abundant water-supply will remove all possi- bility of complaint on this score. Thus, though the enquiry disproved the fact of comparative insalubrity in the College Hospital, and showed that the real cause of septic disease could not be that which had been speculatively assigned for it, ample provision has been made for the supply of all that was demonstrably wanting. 20. But the doctrine of radical defect in the building had been held by high authority, and though thoroughly satisfied with the evidence collected, the Lieutenant-Governor desired that the course of hospitalism should still be closely watched and reported from time to time. The scrutiny has been peculiarly close through the intervening years, for the antiseptic system has been on its trial in the surgical wards, and cases have been examined with a minuteness before unknown. General surgical mortality and the results of test cases have confirmed the judgment and the policy of 1878, and from the words of the Resolution on the Report for 1880, it is clear that the Government considers the question of the origin of hospitalism to have been finally set at rest. I shall not, therefore, in this connexion, offer any remarks on the results of surgical practice in 1881, merely noting that their evidence agrees closely with that already adduced. 21. Apart, however, from the production of hospitalism, the Lieutenant- Governor had expressed a desire for information concerning the progress of antiseptic surgery at the College, and last year the experience of the Surgeons was given in their own words, which represented two different, but not opposite, aspects of the question. To measure with precision the merits of a new method, is seldom the simple task it may appear to be, for the adoption of such a method is seldom unaccompanied by aids and accessories which contribute to results; and that this is true of Listerism, is seen in the scrupulous care with which cleanliness and other precautions have been enforced in the treatment of woundsCALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 11 23. "That the success of surgical treatment during the year has been largely due to the diligent and careful use of antiseptics, I have no doubt whatever. The more strictly I carry out the antiseptic system of wound treat- ment, the better results I obtain; and failure of antiseptics from accident or carelessness has invariably been followed by untoward consequences, local or constitutional, or both." 24. With regard to the cost of strict Listerism Dr. McLeod claims12 REORT ON THE exact details of Lister's methods."

Of these 299 were cured, 188 relieved, 83 were discharged otherwise, and one died. There remained at the end of the year 37 cases under treatment. The daily average number of in-patients was 38.9. Of out-patients there remained from the previous year 101. There were 6,505 new cases, and a total number of 6,606 treated. The daily average number was 78.3. The entire number of operations performed during the year was 360 among in-patients, and 33 cases of previous operation were treated.

The total percentage rose from 57.54 in 1880 to 66.56 in 1881, the increase being due to the very large amount expended on buildings in the Campbell Hospital, and to the decrease in the income of the General Hospital. The details of income and expenditure of the several institutions are given below. 39.

The miscellaneous charges of the hospital amounted to Rs. 10,993 against Rs. 9,915 in 1880, the increase being mainly due to the larger quantity of dressing and bandaging cloth used for antiseptic cases in the First Surgeon's ward. The cost of bedding and clothing and the burning and burying charges exhibit also an increase. The amount expended from hospital funds in 1881 exceeded by Rs. 284 that of the previous year. The principal items of contingent expense which compose the charges entered under the head of "Miscellaneous" are given below. The expenditure in 1880 is also shown in juxtaposition for comparison:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 17 same as in the year under report. The amount expended on stimulants was Rs. 842 in 1881, against Rs. 1,206 and Rs. 1,725 in the two preceding years. The average cost per patient per diem, including paying patients, was 7 annas 9 pies against 8 annas 1 pie in 1880. 57. Miscellaneous charges in 1881 show a slight increase over the pre- vious year owing to inclusion for the first time in the accounts of the expenditure incurred from the Prince Golam Mahomed's fund as stated above. Excluding this outlay, the charges show a reduction of Rs. 105 on those of 1880. The charges are distributed as follows:18 REPORT ON THE medicines was the same as in 1880. The dieting charges fell from Rs. 6,615 in 1880 to Rs. 5,435 in 1881, the prices of the articles being cheaper in the year under review. The cost per head was 2 annas 6 pie against 2 annas 8 pie in 1880. Miscellaneous charges amounted to Rs. 730 in 1881 against Rs. 513 in 1880, the increase being confined to clothing, which cost Rs. 340 in 1881 against Rs. 136 in 1880. The Public Works Department charges in 1881 were Rs. 1,001 against Rs. 2,165 in the preceding year. 66. Mayo Hospital.19 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 72. The receipts under all the heads in 1881 show a reduction, except the amount received on account of interest on investments, which shows an increase of Rs. 432. Under the head of incomes from "local or other funds" nothing was shown in the accounts of 1880, whereas in the year under review 6,350 has been entered. Apparently the money realized from seamen's dieting, of which no specific entry appears in the accounts of 1881, has been shown under the head of income from local or other funds. The forfeiture of deposits, amounting to Rs. 2,863 in 1880, cannot of course recur. However, the total income from private sources fell from Rs. 31,763 in 1880 to Rs. 23,665 in 1881. No explana- tion has been offered on this; but it is evident that the decrease was chiefly due to the recent orders of Government reducing the charge for treatment of sailors to Re. 1 per diem. On this reduction Dr. Pilcher remarks that this charge "is not enough to cover the charges of an European patient, among whom there is often necessity, in special cases of sickness, for a special nurse at Rs. 2-8 a day." In 1881, 276 seamen were treated, against 196 in 1880. Government contribution to this hospital amounted to Rs. 5,276, against Rs. 8,649 in 1880 and Rs. 15,304 in 1879. In the year 1879 the contribution included a special grant of Rs. 10,501 for extension of European accommodation. 73. The total expenditure in 1881, exclusive of the amount invested, was Rs. 28,042, against Rs. 34,950. Excluding the building charges, the ordinary expenditure of the hospital amounted to Rs. 21,464, to compare with Rs. 26,935 in 1880. 74. The expenditure on establishment, which Dr Pilcher says was as small as it could be made consistently with efficiency, amounted to Rs. 9,543, against Rs. 10,645 in 1880. It is also stated that, "considering the rates for coolies' labour at Howrah, the hospital servants are poorly paid, while their work is sometimes irksome and distasteful." Again, "the expenditure on the nursing establishment is less than it should be, and an early opportunity will be taken to remedy these defects." Bazar medicines cost Rs. 558, against Rs. 148 in 1880, and Rs. 232 in 1879. The cause of this enormous increase over the previous year's expenditure has not been explained. Europe medicines cost Rs. 1,151, against Rs. 2,304 in 1880. Dieting charges amounted to Rs. 6,677, against Rs. 5,996 in 1880. The daily number of in-patients was the same as in 1880. The excess expenditure, it appears, occurred among European patients, whose cost per diet is shown to be 9 annas 2 pie, against 7 annas 11 pie in 1880. The corresponding charges in the Medical College, General and Campbell Hospitals, were 6 annas, 7 annas 9 pie, and 7 annas 2 pie repectively. There was no variation in the cost per head among natives, which is the lowest of all the hospitals. Miscellaneous charges exhibit considerable reduction on those of 1880, viz. Rs. 3,524, against Rs, 7,840. The building charges fell from Rs. 8,014 in 1880 to Rs. 6,577 in 1881. 75. The following statement shows the number of sick treated in 1881, and the expenditure of the institutions exclusive of the salaries of commissioned Medical officers and the building charges:20 REPORT ON THE The total number of sick daily treated was 2,889.5 in all the hospitals, viz. 1,044.3 in and 1,845.2 out-patients. The corresponding figures in 1880 were 3,070.5, 1,110.5, and 1,960. Of the total treated, 381 were Europeans and Eurasians (279.6 in and 101.4 out-patients) and 2,508.5 were natives, consisting of 764.7 in and 1,743.8 out-patients. The total expenditure amounted to Rs. 2,90,390, in which the salaries of two resident medical officers of the Medical College Hospital have been included. The expenditure of Government shown in the final column includes the salaries of commissioned medical officers and the money expended by Government on buildings. MEDICAL COLLEGE HOSPITAL. 76. Brigade-Surgeon J. M. Coates was in charge of the hospital during the year. Surgeon-Major K. McLeod was First Surgeon, and Surgeon-Major D. Raye was Second Surgeon. Surgeon-Major R. Harvey was Obstetric Phy- sician throughout the year. 77. The total number of in-door patients treated during the year, exclu- sive of the inmates of the Eye Infirmary, was 4,773, showing an increase of 200 as compared with the previous year. 78. There were 620 deaths, or a rate of 129 per 1,000 of total treated, against 128 in 1880 and 130, 135, 108, 136, and 152 in the five preceding years. Excluding 155 moribund cases, in which 41 cholera cases are not included, the rate per 1,000 was 100, as compared with 96.8 in 1880. Two thousand one hundred and eighty persons were treated in the Christian wards, of whom 140 died, or a rate of 64 per 1,000 in 1881, including moribunds, against 69.6, 69.1, 70.8, 48.8 and 71.9 in the five preceding years. Among the natives the rate of mortality was 185 per 1,000, against 195 in 1880, and 190, 215, 166, and 193 in the four preceding years. The following table shows the rate of mortality from principal diseases in the past year as contrasted with 1879 and 1880:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 21 83. The total number of patients treated in 1881 was 2,863 against 3,168 in 1880. Of these, 1,444 were sailors, 1,180 non-paying, and 239 paying patients, against 1,661, 1,260, and 247 in 1880. The total number treated in 1881 was considerably less than that of any of the previous five years. The falling off was chiefly among the sailors, whose number for the previous five years averaged 2,031. The daily average number of sick was 136 against 152 in 1880, and 181, the average of the decade. The fluctuations are said to be deter- mined largely by the amount of shipping in the port. It is observable, however, that in 1881 more seamen were admitted into the Howrah Hospital than in 1880. The Port Health Officer records that fewer seamen in total were sent to hospital in 1881. 84. The number of deaths in 1881 was 137 against 102 in the preceding year, or a rate of 47.8 per 1,000, against 32 and 45 in the two preceding years. Excluding the deaths from cholera, the rate per 1000 is 37 in 1881, 28 in 1880, and 38 in 1879. The average for the ten years is 45. Including cholera deaths the average is 64. Dr. Birch does not explain the cause of this increase over 1880, but remarks that " very little is to be learned from the mortality of an institution of this kind." Something must be due to reduction in the number of seamen with their more trivial cases. It appears that the deaths in 1881 from principal causes were more numerous than the preceding year. Cholera alone accounts for 19 deaths. There were treated 53 cases with 32 deaths in 1881 against 21 and 13 in 1880. Similarly dysentery caused 11 deaths against 3 in 1880. Ten cases of typhoid fever were treated with 5 deaths against 6 and 2. Phthisis caused 16 deaths against 17, pneu- monia 5 against 3, and remittent fever 8 against 4 in 1880. Thus the deaths from these causes account for an increase of 35 cases in 1881 over those of the previous year. In 1879 the total deaths numbered 142, exceeding by 5 the mortality of the year under review. There were performed during the year 59 major operations of more or less importance, against 61 in 1880. Minor operations were performed in 251 cases against 212. 85. The latrine accommodation, especially that of the centre block of buildings, is reported to be defective. The Superintendent has communicated his plans to the Executive Engineer, with a view to improvement. Regarding the arrangements under which the patients are dieted in the hospital, Dr. Birch says: " I consider them satisfactory in every way. The diet is certainly liberal, I have never had a complaint of any kind from any patient during the short time I have had charge." With the nursing of the hospital the Superintendent has every reason to be satisfied. Both the Lady Superintendents left in Decem- ber, and were succeeded by three members of the Clewer Sisterhood, under whose immediate control the nurses now work. The hospital subordinate staff are favourably noticed, especially Mr. Mills, the steward, and Mr. Fleming. CAMPBELL HOSPITAL. 86. Surgeon-Major S. C. Mackenzie was in charge of the hospital through- out the year. 87. The admissions into hospital were 5,675 against 6,460 in 1880. The decrease in the number of patients was due to the fact that the hospital was undergoing thorough repairs, including re-roofing, during the five months of the year. 88. The daily average number treated was 372 against 404 in 1880. In 1876 and 1877 the numbers were 365 and 343. In 1878 the number was 414, and in 1879 it was the same as in 1880. As usual, malarious fevers were the most pre- valent diseases, of which 1,491 cases were treated during the year against 1,769 in 1880. The next in order of prevalence were dysentery, diarrh22 REPORT ON THE true death-rate per 1,000, excluding cholera and moribund cases, was 206 against 204 in 1880. The number of moribund cases admitted into the hos- pital in 1881 was 175 against 196 and 265 in the two preceding years. There were 132 cases of major operation treated in the year, whereof 122 were new. 261 minor operations were performed against 207 in 1880. The death-rate was 9 per cent. in major operations, and 1.4 per cent. in minor operations against 13.3 and 5.2. There were 11 obstetric cases with 2 deaths against 18 and 2 in 1880. The two women who died during the year under review are said to have been brought into hospital in an exhausted and mori- bund state, and succumbed a few hours after admission. 89. It was thought desirable to increase variety in the diet-scale during the year. Dr. Mackenzie, therefore, introduced a new scale, which, after a careful trial of several months, has been favourably reported on by the medical officers. 90. The cook-house of the general wards still remains in an unsatisfac- tory state, no improvements being effected during the year. The cook-house attached to the small-pox ward is a bamboo and mat shed, which should be replaced by a good masonry building. The hospital accommodation was found to be sufficient with one exception. This was an observation ward, which is urgently needed for exanthematous cases, and will shortly be pro- vided. The drainage of the compound is still defective. The hospital and compound were, as usual, lighted with kerosine oil lamps. POLICE HOSPITAL. 91. Surgeon-Major S. C. Mackenzie was in charge of the hospital through- out the year. 92. The strength of the police force was 2,806 in 1881 against 2,823 of the previous year. There were 2,589 admissions into the hospital against 2,625 in 1880, and 2,586 in 1879. The ratio of admissions to total strength was 922 per 1,000 against 929 in 1880. The daily average number treated was 98 in 1881 against 107 in the preceding year. The prevailing diseases were ague, dysentery, bronchitis, enlarged spleen, and dyspepsia. The admissions from these diseases show a reduction over those of 1880, except in the cases of dysentery and bronchitis, which exhibit an increase of 103 and 8 cases respectively. Seventy cases of venereal disease were treated during the year against 77 in 1880. Small-pox occurred in 5 cases, of which 4 were cured and 1 remained in the hospital at the close of the year. All the unprotected members of the police were vaccinated during the months of January and December by the Vaccine Department. Cholera caused 4 deaths in 14 cases against 8 in 17 in 1880. These were brought into the hospital in a moribund condition, and died within 24 hours of admission. 93. The total number of deaths during the year was 35 against 30, 36, 31, and 63 in the four preceding years. The death-rate on admissions was 1.3, and on total strength of the force was 1.2 per cent. against 1.1 and 1.0 in 1880. The slight increase was due principally to remittent fever, from which 14 persons died in 1881 against 3 in the previous year. 94. The hospital buildings, compound, and drains are in good order. Two masonry bathing platforms, two platforms for cleaning utensils, and a urinal, were erected in the compound during the year. MAYO HOSPITAL. 95. Surgeon-Major H. Cayley was in charge of the hospital from 1st January to 22nd July and from 21st October to the end of the year. Surgeon- Major R. C. Sanders officiated from 23rd July to 22nd October. 96. There were 1,819 in-door patients treated during the year, with a daily average of 91. The corresponding numbers in 1880 were 1863 and 87. The total number of deaths was 299, or 16.4 per cent., against 285, or 15.3 per cent., in 1880. The most fatal disease was cholera, with 83 deaths in 160 cases, or 51.8 per cent. The disease was more than usually prevalent during the year. Thirty-two persons died from fever in 326 cases; there was one case of fever which presented all the characters of true typhoid, Pneumonia and lung disease were fatal in 34 cases out of 114. From diarrhCALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 23 on admission. Tetanus was the cause of 13 deaths in 25 cases. There were 173 surgical operations, resulting in 21 deaths, or 12.1 per cent. Of the out- patients the total treated was 48,059, and the daily average attendance was 386. In 1880 the numbers were 48,617 and 388. 97. At the Chandney Hospital 306 in-door patients were treated, with a daily average of 5.8. The number treated in 1880 was 267, with a daily average of 7.2. The total death-rate was 91 per 1,000, against 74 in 1880. Of the out-patients, the total treated was 68,592, with a daily average of 460, against 64,533 and 500 in 1880. 98. At the Chitpore Dispensary the total number of out-patients treated was 19,908 with a daily average of 144, against 20,610 and 155 in 1880. 99. At the Park Street Dispensary the numbers were 31,282 and 224, against 30,800 and 235 in 1880. 100. At the Sukea's Street Dispensary the total treated was 15,513, and the daily average attendance 133, against 15,697 and 138 in 1880. 101. The aggregate numbers of patients treated at the Mayo Hospital and Dispensaries were:24 REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 105. The mortality in 1881, as compared with the previous year, shows an increase, which is said to have been due to a greater number of patients admitted in a dying state. The number was 78 among natives; and Dr. Pilcher remarks that "this is but a small proportion of the hopeless cases of disease sent to the hospital from all parts of this very populous town." He is of opinion that the accommodation afforded by the new native ward has caused great reduction in the mortality among the ordinary in-patients, as there have been fewer instances of septic poisoning after severe injuries and operations than in previous years. The subjoined table shows the principal diseases causing deaths among natives, and the duration of residence in hospital:APPENDIX. D

MEDICAL & MUNICIPAL DEPT. MEDICAL. DARJEELING, THE 22ND JUNE 1882. RESOLUTION. READ( 2 ) The number of in-patients fell from 21,458 in 1880 to 20,764 during the year under review. The decrease was confined to the Campbell Hospital (807) and the General Hospital (305). There was an increase of 292 at the Medical College and an increase of 83 at Howrah, while in the Mayo and Police Hospitals the numbers were practically unchanged. It is explained that only a portion of the Campbell Hospital building was available for patients during several months owing to the extensive repair works that were being carried out. Part of the increase at the Medical College is attributed to this cause. Out-door patients are treated only at the Medical College and the Mayo and Howrah Hospitals. There was an increase in the two former of 1,210 and 3,097 respectively, while at Howrah there was a falling off of 834. The total increase over the numbers of 1880 was therefore 3,473. The out-door practice of the Mayo Hospital and its associated dispensaries was as follows:(3) were more severe, as they were in the General Hospital of Calcutta. This points to sailors as the chief sufferers. In respiratory affections there was but a trifling difference from the previous year, either in quantity or fatality, and the same is true of dysentery and diarrh( 4 ) 7. The educational aspect of the question has not been lost sight of. Even after liberal allowance has been made for the lessened use of expensive articles of diet, the cost of strict Listerian treatment is admittedly much greater than that of the ordinary methods; spray producers, which are essential to its application, are costly and fragile, and can only be properly used with skilled assistance; and however great the value of this treatment may be, when it is applied with care and skill, and without regard to cost, there is no hope of its being within the reach of the mass of the population of these provinces. The pupils whose medical training is one of the chief functions of the Calcutta hospitals will seldom be called on to practise Listerism in afterlife, and their practical usefulness would be much impaired if they were taught to look upon the costly appliances of the system as indispensable. 8. The number of in-patients treated by the Obstetric Physician shows a considerable falling off, being only 1,008 in 1881 against 1,277, 1,204, 1,238, 1,109, and 1,155 in the five preceding years. There were 6,500 out-patients during the first six months of the year. The cases treated during the second- half have been amalgamated with those of the general out-door dispensary. 9. In the Ophthalmic Hospital 608 persons were treated during the year, of whom 555 were fresh admissions. Of these, 299 were cured and 188 relieved. Three hundred and sixty operations were performed, of which 218 resulted in cures, while 88 persons were relieved. Besides these, 6,505 out-patients were treated during the year. 10. The following table shows the number of cases of enteric and remit- tent fever treated in each of the hospitals in each year since 1872:( 5 ) 251 minor operations were performed during the year. The latrine accommo- dation is reported to be defective. This should receive the immediate attention of the Superintendent, and no time should be lost in getting it put on a proper footing. Dr. Birch considers that the diet is " certainly liberal, " and reports that he has never had a complaint from a patient since he has been in charge. 13. At the Campbell Hospital the number of admissions fell to 6,074. The decrease is due to the reduction of available space, occasioned by the repairs which were in progress for over five months of the year. Malarious fever was the most prevalent disease, and contributed 1,491 cases. Next in order came dysentery, diarrh( 6 ) for the first time. The cost of diet and stimulants fell from Rs. 29,752 to Rs. 25,787. The reduction is said to be due chiefly to the cheapness of pro- visions in the year under review. The average cost of each diet for Europeans was 6 annas against 6 annas 6 pies in 1880, and for natives it was 2 annas 6 pies against 2 annas 10 pies. The miscellaneous charges rose from Rs. 9,915 to Rs. 10,993. The increase was chiefly due to the larger quantity of dressing and bandaging cloth required for the antiseptic treatment adopted in the First Surgeon's Ward. 18. The expenditure in the Presidency General Hospital was Rs. 1,05,894 against Rs. 1,02,352 in 1880. The accounts of Prince Gholam Mahomed's Fund were amalgamated with those of the hospital: the receipts from the Fund were Rs. 1,511, the expenditure Rs. 681, and the closing balance Rs. 5,057. The increase in the total expenditure was attributable to the higher charges for building and repairs. The receipts from the Port Commissioners fell from Rs. 65,168 to Rs. 39,235. The decrease was mainly due to the reduction in the payments for seamen from the Port Hospital Dues Fund. These were reduced from Rs. 2 to Re. 1.4 per diem in November 1880, and to Re. 1 in August 1881. Dr. Payne points out that this rate is insufficient, as the total actual cost per patient per diem was Rs. 1-13-4 in 1880 and Rs. 1-7-8 in 1881. It is believed that if all establishment and miscellaneous charges were included, the average cost would be found to be higher. Government, however, were compelled to reduce the rate, and to place this heavy charge on the public revenues in order to avoid legislating to raise the limit of the Port Hospital Dues, and thus throwing additional expense upon the Shipping of the Port. The cost of bazar medicines fell from Rs. 1,855 to Rs. 1,599, and that of Europe medicines from Rs. 5,176 to Rs. 4,449. The expenditure on diet was at the same rate as in 1879 and 1880. The expenditure on stimulants was, however, considerably reduced, being only Rs. 842 against Rs. 1,206 in 1880. This result is satisfactory. The average cost per patient per diem of diet and stimulants combined was 7 annas 9 pies against 8 annas 1 pie in 1880. This includes paying patients. 19. In the Campbell Hospital the total expenditure amounted to Rs. 1,02,773 against Rs. 69,295 in 1880. The whole of the large increase is due to the expenditure on repairs and improvements, which amounted to Rs. 49,474. Apart from this outlay, there was a reduction under every head of expenditure. This was, however, mainly due to the smaller number of patients treated. The daily average cost of diet was 7 annas 2 pies for Europeans and 2 annas 4 pies for natives. The repairs and improvements have been carried out on a most extensive scale. They included the construction of a dead-house, the conversion of the old Blind Asylum into a new dispensary office and quarters for the Resident Surgeons, the re-roofing of a large portion of the hospital building, as well as the ordinary quadrennial repairs. In the Police Hospital the charges were much the same as in the previous year. The average cost of diets fell from 2 annas 8 pies to 2 annas 6 pies, the result of a fall in prices for all articles of food in 1881. 20. The funds of the Mayo Hospital are in a most flourishing condition. The invested capital on 1st January 1881 amounted to Rs. 3,34,900, and this was increased during the year by Rs. 2,500, bringing the total up to Rs. 3,37,400. The Surgeon-General suggests that in view of the sums invested in this hospital from annual income, the payments of Government should be re-con- sidered. These payments amounted to Rs. 37,366 during the year under review. The proposal will be considered in the Financial Department of this Government. The total expenditure amounted to Rs. 59,413 against Rs. 55,159 in the previous year. The expenditure on Europe medicines amounted to Rs. 9,784, which is Rs. 4,096 in excess of that of 1880. It is explained that there is now a large stock of medicines in hand, which is expected to last for some time. The daily average cost of diets was 2 annas 11 pies against 2 annas 8 pies in 1880. If diets privately supplied are excluded, the cost becomes 3 annas 2 pies against 2 annas 11 pies last year. Not only was the average cost higher than in any other Calcutta hospital, but it was higher than the cost in the same hospital in the previous year, although 1881 was a notoriously cheaper year than 1880. The Lieutenant- Governor considers that some explanation should have been given of this.
( 7 ) 21. At the Howrah Hospital the income from private sources fell from Rs. 31,763 to Rs. 23,665. The decrease is attributed chiefly to the reduction in the charge for treatment of sailors from Re. 1-4 to Re. 1 per diem. The receipts from this source appear to have been credited under the head of " Receipts from local or other funds." The Government grant amounted to Rs. 5,276 against Rs. 8,649 in the previous year. The total expenditure was Rs. 28,042 against Rs. 34,950. There was a large increase of expenditure under the head of bazar medicines, which is not explained. The average cost of diet for Europeans rose from 7 annas 11 pies to 9 annas 2 pies. This increase is abnormal. The cost of native diets was the lowest in all the hospitals. 22. The total expenditure on the sick in all the hospitals taken together was Rs. 2,90,106, of which Rs. 2,74,388 was paid by Government. The average daily attendance was 2,889, of whom 1,044 were in-patients and 1,845 out- patients. Of the daily average 381 were Europeans and 2,508 natives. 23. The number of Europeans treated in the Medical College and General Hospital was 5,043, of whom 277 died, giving a death-rate of 54 per mille against 50, the average of the previous three years. Similarly the number of natives treated at the Medical College and Campbell Hospitals was 8,667, of whom 1,922 died, giving a death-rate of 221 per mille against 235, the average of the previous three years. The total charge for diet and stimulants in the Medical College and the General and Campbell Hospitals was lower than it has ever been before. It amounted only to Rs. 70,231 against 82,534 in 1880 and 78,878 in 1879. Thus a large reduction in the expenditure on diet and stimu- lants has been accompanied by a considerable decrease in the death-rate for natives, and a very small increase in that for Europeans. This small increase is wholly attributable to the reduction in the number of sailor patients whose ailments are usually trifling, and tend to keep down the European death-rate.

6 REPORT ON THE 10. Particular diseases.CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 7 in the several hospitals with a view to ascertaining how far reduced mortality may be ascribed to increased strictness in pursuing the costly system of Lister in treating cases of operation. 14. In the first surgeon's ward at the college hospital, Dr. McLeod reports a total number of 127 operations with 9 deaths, showing marked im- provement on past years. He ascribes this to the absence of hospitalism, the more thorough use of antiseptics, and in some measure to the absence of desperate cases requiring operation in the last resort. All the deaths are satis- factorily explained as beyond prevention. Dr. McLeod says that the favour- able results were not due to any exceptional paucity of severe operations, though a large majority presented fair promise of recovery. Taking, as tests, those cases which may be fairly regarded as illustrating the effects of anti- septic practice, it does not appear that there was improvement on the results of the previous year. Thus in 1882 there were 16 operations for excision of bones and joints with 3 deaths. In 1881 there were 11 operations with one death. These figures apply to both surgical wards; but in both antiseptic practice was more strictly pursued in 1882. There were 24 major amputations in 1882 with 8 deaths, and 17 in 1881 with 6 deaths. In the first surgeon's ward there was a single imported case of erysipelas during the year, and the cases of septic fever which occurred had arisen mostly before admission. 15. The second surgeon reports 152 major operations in his ward in 1882 with 20 deaths, against 102 with 20 deaths in 1881. Three deaths only were due in 1882 to septicaemia contracted in hospital. Of the 17 remaining cases 4 were desperate, operation being the last resort. There were 9 deaths from septicaemia in 1881. Dr. Raye, in the absence of any other known difference between the years, attributes "some part at least of the success to the use of antiseptics." There were three cases of erysipelas in his ward in 1882, but no death from it. He believes antiseptics to give better results than other modes of treatment, if for no other reason, simply from their essential cleanli- ness. He continues to employ less elaborate dressings in his less important cases. 16. The large number of scrotal tumours removed in 1882 at the college hospital and the small number of deaths will, no doubt, attract attention. The record of these cases cannot be used for my present purpose without details. The cases differ so widely among themselves, in severity and other points, and the application of strict Listerism to them is so difficult, that it can scarcely be said to succeed or fail. 17. In the Medical college hospital, then, there was in 1882 a great reduction in the quantity of those affections known as hospitalism. There was very little mortality after surgical operation in general, but no improvement in the results of certain severe cases employed as tests. All this accompanied increased strictness in the application of antiseptic dressings, and the question is, was this the cause, and that the effect ? Test cases may be said to have taken their own course; but they are probably cases in which Listerism was most fully used in the two years, and therefore results have fluctuated from other causes. Surgical mortality, generally low in the wards, indicates some general and favourable influence. This may still be the influence of Listerism, for its use is general and the system includes much that is good besides its pecu- liar dressings. All else, however, can be employed without the great cost and skill which the system demands. It is easy to conceive that greater strictness of method, applied to all surgical cases, may so far have affected septic influence in the wards as to have favoured the progress of operation cases, but this cannot be derived as an inference from the events of 1882, inasmuch as the most illustrative class of cases shared no advantage. There was, therefore, probably some other cause for the great total difference of the year, and this must be sought for in the events of other hospitals where practice differs, but where general, that is outside, influences are much the same. The comparison is not now between absolute results in the several hospitals, but between events of the separate years in each. If it should appear that elsewhere the year 1882 has differed, in its surgical incidents, as widely from 1881 as it has at the medical college, we shall be debarred from carrying the change to the credit of Listerism.
8 REPORT ON THE 18. At the General hospital in 1882 there were 83 important operations with 6 deaths. In 1881 there had been 61 cases with 4 deaths; but the operations were much less severe and included none of the test cases, of which 7 occurred in 1882, accounting for 2 deaths. In 1880 there had been 71 operations, also without test cases, but with 9 deaths. The past year therefore shows very favourably here. 19. At the Mayo hospital 260 operation cases were treated during the year, of which 245 were new. Of these, 208 were cured, 13 relieved, 1 dis- charged otherwise, and 22 died. Sixteen cases remained in the hospital at the close of the year. Major amputations numbered 26 with 8 deaths. There were 26 operations for scrotal tumours, whereof 21 were new cases. Of these, 19 were cured, 2 died, and 5 remained at the end of the year. The total number of operation cases treated in 1881 was 278 with 21 deaths. 20. At the Campbell hospital there were 118 operations in 1882 with 12 deaths. In 1881 there had been 132 cases with 12 deaths; but the number of test cases, all severe, rose from 13 in 1881 with 3 deaths to 21 in 1882 with 6 deaths, of which 5 were of the most fatal kind. Deducting these, we find 119 operations in 1881 with 9 deaths, and 97 cases in 1882 with 6 deaths. 21. At Howrah there were 54 cases of operation in 1881 with 8 deaths, and 29 in 1882 with 3 deaths; but there were fewer severe cases in the latter year. 22. It must be admitted, I think, that the year was, from some unknown cause, favourable to surgical work; but it cannot be said that the other hospitals have given evidence which refutes the opinion of the college surgeons on the greatly reduced mortality after operation in their wards. If on the other hand this opinion be adopted, it will not explain increased fatality in test cases in 1882, nor the fact that, in these cases, results as good, if not better, are obtained elsewhere with less elaborate and costly appliances. The antiseptic method is apparently the best that has yet been invented, but the measure of its superi- ority has yet to be taken, and the advantage of strict Listerism seems doubtful in hospital practice; while, as a system to be taught exclusively to pupils, it is not desirable.

Concerning the deaths in the obstetric wards it is recorded that there were 6 Europeans and 21 natives in a moribund state on admission. 26. The Eden hospital was occupied on 17th July 1882. It offers accommodation to 41 Europeans and 42 natives. Into the old wards 24 of the former and 12 of the latter could be received. During the first-half of the year there was a daily average number of 30.9 house-patients. During the rest of the year the number was 43.3. 27. The excellent private accommodation of the new hospital is likely to be much appreciated. A sum of Rs. 3,018 was received from patients between July and December. 28. The establishment of the hospital has been the subject of much con- sideration. It has been based hitherto on a scheme laid down by Dr. Charles, which provided that the nursing should be done by the class of civil and military pupil midwives, with a head and a second midwife or matron. There were some mistakes of system at the outset, and the nursing was not satisfactory. An attempt was made, with the sanction of Government, to rectify this, by placing all the nurses under the control of the resident sister who took up her quarters in the building, and re-adjusting the establishment, but the basis of pupil nursing was retained. It has been found lately that this is wrong. The bedside work of a large hospital cannot be left dependent on a class who are merely learning to nurse, and whose members are removed as soon as they become qualified to earn a living for themselves. Some fixed establishment is indispensable, less than would be required if there were no pupils, but enough to enable the sister to carry on the work under all fluctua- tions. A scheme framed with this object is in course of preparation for submission to Government. It will be considered satisfactory, I think, that the Eden hospital, with imperfect nursing and other disadvantages inseparable from a commencement, should have already given evidence of having met a public want. 29. The system of civil and military nurses was inaugurated during the year, but not very successfully. The intentions of Government had been misunderstood and due control had not been provided. There were other serious defects which threatened to frustrate altogether the objects of the scheme. A system has lately been organized, with the approval of Govern- ment, which will ensure the fulfilment of its intention, if women are forth- coming as pupils in sufficient numbers. 30.

The rate per cent contributed by Government to the cost of the several hospitals was as follows:12 REPORT ON THE 41.The total cost of diet and stimulants was Rs. 26,293, against Rs.25,787 in 1881. There was an increased number of native patients treated in 1882. Stimulants cost Rs. 223 in excess of the expenditure in 1881, and some alterations were made in the varieties of diets. Among Europeans the average cost of each diet was 6 annas and among natives it was 2annas 7 pie, against 6 annas and 2 annas 6 pie in 1881. The rules regarding supple- mentary diets from home had been rigidly enforced during the year. 42.The charges on miscellaneous items were less by Rs 314 than those of 1881. The details are given belowCALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 13 The increase was chiefly due to the purchase of new clothing, which cost Rs. 4,334, against Rs. 2,057 in 1881. The expenditure under this head is regulated by periodical requirements, and Dr. Birch says that the clothing of the hospital is still very imperfect, and very large quantities of old and worn- out clothing need to be replaced. The outlay under 14 REPORT ON THE by the Calcutta and Suburban municipalities and one-sixth by Government. The income side of statement No. IX has been adjusted accordingly. 62. There was a slight increase in the expenditure on establishment, the amount being Rs. 8,812 in 1882 against Rs. 8,763 in the preceding year. Bazar medicines cost Rs. 46 against Rs. 39. The expenditure on Europe medicines exceeded that of 1881 by Rs. 72. Owing to the change of dates in the submission of indents on the medical store department in 1882, the sup- ply of medical stores received in the hospital was that for a year and a half for the first time, hence the apparent increase in the expenditure. The cost of dieting fell from Rs. 5,435 in 1881 to that of Rs. 4,419 in the year under review. This was due partly to the smaller number of patients treated in 1882 and partly to the cheapness of provisions. The cost, per head per diem, was 2 annas 4 pie against 2 annas 6 pie in 1881. No alteration was made in the diets. Dr. Nilcholson remarks that CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 15 Building charges exceeded those of 1881 by Rs. 7,552. The amount expended in 1881 was Rs. 801. 66. Howrah general hospital.16 REPORT ON THE There were treated in all the hospitals 2,621 patients daily, composed of 1,015 in and 1,606 out patients. The corresponding figures in 1881 were 2,889, 1,044, and 1,845 respectively. Of the in-patients, 296 were Europeans and Eurasians and 719 natives. The former figure shows an increase of 17 and the latter a decrease of 45 on the numbers of 1881. The daily number of out-patients, both European and native, fell considerably in 1882 as compared with the preceding year. The total expenditure on the sick, exclusive of the salaries of commissioned officers and the amount spent on buildings, amounted to Rs. 2,91,418 against Rs. 2,90,106 in 1881. The net cost to Government was Rs. 2,38,224 against Rs. 2,74,388. 70. This account of the Calcutta hospitals in 1882 would be very incom- plete if I should omit to mention the reform which has been brought about in the work of the nurses during the past year. I desire the more to offer my personal testimony regarding the great change that has taken place on this early opportunity, because in former years I have not concealed from the Government my opinion that there was a want of reality in the work of the nurses, which left bedside ministration in the wards practically in the same hands which had rendered it before professional nurses were introduced. Early in 1882 under arrangements made by the committee of the nurses institution, the control of the ward nursing at the medical college and general hospitals passed into the hands of Ladies of the Clewer sisterhood. From the date of their arrival to the present time improvement has made rapid progress. Having been accustomed in England to minister with their own hands to the wants of sick people, to prepare appliances, and use all the means required at the bedside, these ladies could not fail to notice, at once, faults which indicated difficulties before them greater than any they had anticipated, for they had to contend, not only against defects arising from want of skill and knowledge, but against the fixed belief that manual work by the bedside, with few exceptions, was unworthy of the nurse, whose duty it was to summon a native servant when a sick man called. The ladies, however, though unused to this kind of pretentiousness, perhaps, had been accustomed to organize and govern as well as to work, and did not shrink from the task of inculcating the dignity of nursing, while they taught the skilful performance of it and enforced order and discipline. How far they are yet satisfied with results I cannot pretend to say, but I think they are much more hopeful of approaching to their own high standard than they were at the outset, and I know that the improvement they have already effected has exceeded all that had seemed possible to the medical officers whose patients have benefited by their exertions. 71. Although the patients in hospital are the first and chief consideration in such a matter as this, the advantages derived from the constant presence, in the wards, of ladies whose knowledge of every detail is complete, are not felt solely by the sick. The medical officer is in regular attendance, and is summoned at irregular hours when he is specially required, but the wants of the sick are constant, and, if they are not supplied, published complaints appear. It is often impossible to detect the defaulter, and a common result of such complaints has been that subordinate officers have made demands for increase of establishment when there has been only culpable neglect on the part of servants already too numerous. The superintendent of the hospital has now a strong ally in the sister, who will know all that occurs and the causes of shortcomings, and if at any time it should appear that alteration of system or establishment is desirable, the controlling officer, and finally the Government, will be well assured that the grounds for it are good and sufficient. 72. I would here guard against any error that may arise from the remarks which have been made on the unsatisfactory nursing in the Eden hospital. The subordinate nurses here were the civil and military pupils. It was intended that these should be placed, with the others, under the command of the sisters; but, apparently from some confusion of educational and medical control, this was not done, and it was not until quite the end of the year that the mistake was rectified. The orders of Government were not made known to the Ladies' committee earlier, and therefore the Sister Superior was in ignorance of their existence. Already the advantage of their intervention has been manifested, for it has lately become quite clear that the nursing

MEDICAL COLLEGE HOSPITAL. 73.Brigade-surgeon J. M. Coates was in charge of the hospital in 1882, Surgeon-major K. McLeod and Surgeon-major D. Raye were first and second surgeons, and Surgeon-major R. Harvey was obstetric physician throughout the year. 74. The total number of in-door patients treated in 1882 was 4,947 against 4,773 in the previous year. This is exclusive of the inmates of the Eye infirmary. 75. There were 611 deaths, or a rate of 123 per 1,000, against 129 in 1881, and 128, 130, 135, 108, 136, and 152 in six preceding years. The rate of mortality in the year under report was, therefore, the lowest on record since 1875, except that of 1877. In the native wards the rate was higher in 1877 than in 1882. There were 2,287 persons treated in the Christian wards with a daily average of 115, of whom 137 died, giving a death-rate of 59 per 1,000 as compared with 64, 69.6, 69.1, 70, 48, and 71 in six preceding years. The number of native in-door patients treated was 2,660 against 2,593, 2,147, and 2,165 in three previous years. The number of deaths was 474, or a rate of 178 per 1,000, against 185, 195, 190, 215, 166, and 193 in six preceding years. The subjoined table exhibits the death-rates from principal diseases among Christians and natives in 1882 and in three previous years:18 REPORT ON THE 80. The total number of paying patients in 1882 shows a considerable increase, and their classes, as compared with the two preceding years, were as follows:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 19 exhibits an increase of 46. The admissions from phthisis fell considerably during the year, being 164 against 214 in 1881. Pneumonia shows an increase of seven cases. For small-pox four Europeans and 21 natives were admitted, against 18 and 67 in 1881. This decrease exactly corresponds with the preva- lence of small-pox in and around Calcutta. Of the 21 cases of natives admitted, seven were from the port, being mostly pilgrims from the shipping. There were two deaths in four cases of Europeans, and one in 21 cases of natives. There were admitted 186 cases of cholera, against 132 and 78 in 1881 and 1880, and the numbers of deaths were 134, 79, and 44 respectively. The total number of deaths was 1,405 to compare with 1,442 in 1881, or fewer by 37 deaths, and the percentage on the total treated was 24.7 against 23.7 in 1881. The increase arises from the larger number of cholera cases treated during the year and of moribund persons admitted. The true death- rate of the hospital per 1,000, excluding cholera and moribund cases, was 204, against 206 and 204 in 1881 and 1880. Moribund cases, excluding cholera, numbered 191, against 175 in 1881. One hundred and eighteen cases of major operation were treated during the year, of which 111 were new. The number of minor operations performed was 226 against 261 in 1881. The death-rate was 10 per cent after major operations, against 9 per cent in 1881, and 1.2 per cent after minor operations, against 1.4 per cent. There were 17 obstetric cases admitted into the hospital against 11 in 1881, resulting in one death against two in 1881. The woman who died was admitted for abortion, but ultimately died from dysentery. The increase in the number of cases treated is small; but it indicates a growing appreciation of this department of the hospital by the native population. 87. There was no change in the diet scales of the hospital. On this the officiating superintendent says that "the diet scales are sufficiently numerous for the wants of the hospital. They are liberal; and where it is necessary to increase them, they readily admit of being supplemented by extras at the discretion of the medical staff of the hospital. During the year the articles of diet supplied have been good, though they have been procured at more favour- able rates than in 1881." 88. The cook-houses of the hospital were in the same unsatisfactory state as formerly reported. A plan and estimate have, however, been made and approved for their improvement at a cost of Rs. 6,377. Two observation wards have been built during the year20 REPORT ON THE persons from diarrhCALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 21 treated exhibited an increase, the daily average attendance of patients showed a diminution. The discrepancy has not been explained. The practice with regard to medicines adopted in the Mayo Hospital seems also to have been used here. The number of out-patients treated in 1879 was 57,863 with a daily average of 524; in 1880 the numbers were 64,533 and 500, and in 1881 it was 68,592 and 460, respectively. The composition of these large figures shows that further enquiry is necessary before they can be accepted. The proportional numbers of the several kinds of cases entered are very unlike those which obtain elsewhere. The scarcity of cholera cases in the past year has been noted; of fever an enormous quantity is recorded, viz. 13,325 cases among out-patients, but of spleen diseases, allied to fever as its result, only 1,227 cases. At the Mayo Hospital the corresponding figures are 4,993 and 2,454, at Sookea's street 3,057 and 1,479, at Chitpore 2,638 and 549. At the Medical College 6,065 and 1,187. In a total number of 70,525 patients there are at the Chandney Hospital no less than 7,126 cases of "worms" returned, or 10.1 per cent of the total. At the Mayo Hospital there were in all 43,012 out-patients with 404 cases of worms, or 0.9 per cent. At Sookea's street we have 15,688 patients with 571 cases of worms, at Chitpore 21,135 with 133, at the Medical College 31,537 with 361 cases, and at Howrah 11,012 cases include only 80 cases of worms. In the provincial dispensaries the proportion of cases of worms to total number was 2.8 per cent. 96. Chitpore Dispensary.22 REPORT ON THE HOWRAH GENERAL HOSPITAL. 100. Surgeon-Major J. G. Pilcher was in charge of the hospital from 1st January to 13th March, and from 17th October to the close of the year. Surgeon-Major H. B. Purves officiated in the intermediate period. 101. The total number of persons treated in the hospital during the past year was 12,616, of whom 3,970 were Europeans and 8,646 were natives. The corresponding numbers in 1881 were 14,151, 4,431, and 9,720 respectively. In-door patients numbered 1,604, of whom 669 were Europeans and 935 natives, against 670 and 970 in 1881. Of the 11,012 out-patients in 1882, 3,301 were Europeans and 7,711 were natives, against 3,761 and 8,750 in the previous year. The decrease is marked in the out-door attendance of natives, and Dr. Pilcher attributes this to the greater healthiness of the season. Regarding the European out-patients, the Superintendent remarks that "it is difficult to keep an exact record of the number of patients who come for advice, and whose circumstances permit them to purchase medicines. Many of these patients, who do not obtain medicines from the charity, escape entry. The attendance of European and East Indian out-patients was not at all less than in previous years." He adds that "the principle that the charity has the largest claim for support from those who make use of it has been kept in view; and though no case of real sickness, which required close watching and nursing, was refused admittance, care was taken to exclude those who go from hospital to hospital, and would impose upon a charity of this kind." Three hundred and fifty-one European seamen where treated, against 276 in 1881. There were eight women confined in the hospital during the year. 102. The following statement exhibits the daily average sick in 1882 and in five preceding years. The register of patients has been more carefully recorded from 1881 than in the previous years. YEARS.

READ( 2 ) occasions, fallacious, and no comparison can be instituted. Generally des- cribed, the year was unhealthy, and the mortality from all causes was above the average. 2. The following table shews the number of patients treated in each of the Calcutta hospitals during the year:(3) The three hospitals which treat out-door patients( 4 ) of opinion that the events of the past year have finally set at rest the contro- versy as to the fitness of the Medical College Hospital for the treatment of surgical disease. The surgeons of both wards continued to use the systems employed by them in the previous year. Dr. MacLeod, in the first ward, carried out the Listerian method in its entirety; while Dr. Raye confined this method to severe cases, using less elaborate dressings in his less important cases 7. In the two wards together, there were, apart from ophthalmic cases, 279 important surgical operations, which were followed by death in 29 instances. In 1881 there had been 252 operations with 54 deaths. There was thus a very marked improvement in the degree of mortality after operative surgery in all cases taken together, and this is stated to have been accompanied by increased strictness in the application of antiseptic dressings. On the other hand, it does not appear that there was any improvement on the results of the previous year in cases of exceptional severity which were employed as " tests." In 1882 there were 16 operations for excision of bones and joints, with 3 deaths. In 1881 there had been 11 such operations with one death. In 1882 there were 24 major amputations with 8 deaths. In 1881 there had been 17 with 6 deaths The Surgeon.General points out that in both years Listerism was most strictly used in this class of cases, and that the fluctuations are probably due to other causes. At the same time a greater degree of strictness in the application of antiseptic treatment (as distinguished from strict Listerism) in ordinary cases has been followed by a large reduction of mortality. A comparison of the relative results obtained during 1881 and 1882, respectively, in the General, Mayo, Campbell, and Howrah Hospitals, where no change of system was introduced, shews some improvement in the first and last named, and some slight retrogression in the other two. The Surgeon-General sums up the discussion with the following remarks, in which the Lieutenant-Governor generally concurs:( 5 ) the old obstetric ward was in use, had been 30.9, immediately rose to 43.3. The establishment of the new hospital was reorganized, and has now been placed on a satisfactory footing. Pupil nurses are still employed, but they are no longer relied on to do the main part of the work. For this a sufficient staff of trained nurses from the Canning Home has now been permanently entertained. The Surgeon General considers it satisfactory "that the Eden Hospital, with imperfect nursing and other disadvantages inseparable from a commencement, should have already given evidence of having met a public want." The total number of cases treated by the obstetric physician during the year was 1,323, of whom 802 were European and 521 native patients. The number of deaths was 75 against 76 in the previous year, out of a total of 1,008 patients. 11. In the Medical College Hospital the number of in-door patients treated was 4,947, exclusive of ophthalmic cases, against 4,773 in the previous year. The number of deaths was 611, or at the rate of 123 per 1,000, against 129 in 1881. This rate is the lowest on record since 1875, except that of 1877. Of the patients treated, 2,287 were Christians and 2,660 natives, the death-rates of the two races being 59 and 178 per 1,000 respectively. The death-rates from fevers of Christians and natives were 37.4 and 139.5 respec- tively; from dysentery and diarrh( 6 ) 14. The number of admissions into the Police Hospital indicates some improvement in the health of the force during the year. They amounted to 2,394 against 2,589 in 1881 and 2,625 in 1880, out of a total strength of 2,806. The daily average number of sick was 83 against 98 and 107 in the two previous years. Malarious fevers shewed a decrease from 1,061 to 860, and there was also a slight decrease under dysentery, diarrh( 7 ) were Europeans and 935 natives. The out-door patients numbered 11,012, viz.( 8 ) increase under bazar medicines, diet, and miscellaneous. The cost of diet and stimulants rose from Rs. 24,163 to Rs. 26,423, the increase being due to the larger number of patients treated in 1882. The average cost of each diet was 7 annas 7 pies against 7 annas 9 pies in 1881. The expenditure on buildings amounted to Rs. 10,122, including a sum of Rs. 6,317 spent on quadrennial repairs to the hospital. 20. The total receipts of the Campbell Hospital amounted to Rs. 31,443, including the donation of Rs. 30,000 from the Calcutta Municipality. The total expenditure was Rs. 78,498, against Rs. 1,02,773 in the previous year. In 1881, however, there was exceptionally heavy expenditure on buildings. The amount spent on the ordinary requirements of the hospital in 1882 was Rs. 58,404 against Rs. 53,299 in 1881. The cost of establishment was Rs. 24,697, shewing an increase of Rs. 684, which is not fully explained. The outlay on diet and stimulants amounted to Rs. 17,530 against Rs. 20,281. This fall is due partly to the reduction in the number of patients treated, and partly to the greater cheapness of the year under review, the cost of each diet having been reduced from 2 annas 4 pies to 2 annas 2 pies. The expenditure under the head of "Miscellaneous" was Rs. 12,245 against Rs. 4,224. This large increase, amounting to Rs. 8,021, is not sufficiently explained. 21. The total expenditure at the Police Hospital was Rs. 16,124, being almost exactly the same as in the previous year. One-sixth of this amount was borne by Government, the remainder being contributed by the Calcutta and Suburban Municipalities. The cost of dieting fell from Rs. 5,435 in 1881 to Rs. 4,449 in the year under review, and the average cost of each diet was 2 annas 4 pies against 2 annas 6 pies. None of the other items of expenditure call for remark. 22. The invested funds of the Mayo Hospital were increased by Rs. 5,000 during the year. In the Resolution of last year, it was stated that, in view of the large sums invested from annual income, the question of revising the Government grants would be considered in the Financial Department. A report on this subject has since been received from the Governors of the Mayo Hospital, and is now under the consideration of Government. The matter will be separately dealt with. The total expenditure of the hospital and its associated dispensaries amounted to Rs. 58,281, including the outlay on buildings, against Rs. 59,413 in 1881. Of this amount Government contributed Rs 37,366, or 64 per cent. of the whole. The expenditure on establishment was Rs. 31,455, or Rs. 250 in excess of that of 1881. There was a small reduction under the heads of bazar medicines and diet, and a large one under that of Europe medicines and miscellaneous. The Lieutenant- Governor regrets that he is again compelled to notice the high cost of dieting patients in this hospital, which amounted to 3 annas 2 pies, the same as in 1881. Not only is this rate much higher than in any other of the Calcutta Hospitals, but it shews no reduction on the figure of the previous year, although prices were decidedly lower in 1882 than in 1881. Attention was drawn to this point in the Resolution recorded last year. 23. The income of the Howrah Hospital from private sources amounted to Rs. 22,885, of which Rs. 6,904 was paid by the Port Fund for diet of sick seamen, Rs. 2,400 contributed by the municipality, Rs. 1,446 represented interest on investments, and Rs. 12,129 payments by the East Indian Railway Company, British India Steam Navigation Company and others. It is not encouraging to notice that native subscriptions to this important charity amounted to Rs. 6 only. Government contributed Rs. 5,168 in cash, and part of the salary of the Assistant Surgeon. The total expenditure amounted to Rs. 23,634 against Rs. 28,032 in 1881. Deducting building charges, it appears that the actual amount spent on the sick was Rs. 22,723. The average cost of each diet among Europeans was 9 annas against 9 annas and 2 pies, and among natives it was 1 anna 10 pies against 1 anna and 7 pies in 1882. The per- centage of total cost borne by Government was 21.8. 24. The Surgeon-General bears grateful testimony to the value of the reforms effected in the work of the nurses in the Medical College and General Hospitals by the ladies of the Clewer Sisterhood. Early in 1882, under arrangements made by the Committee of the Nurses' Institution, the control of the nursing arrangements passed into the hands of these ladies; and from the
( 9 ) date of their arrival, improvement has made rapid progress. Not only have the administrative arrangements of the hopitals benefitted by their trained skill and experience in the practical details of nursing, but the patients have testified in no uncertain manner to the advantages resulting from their constant presence and patient attention. The Lieutenant-Governor's cordial thanks are due to these ladies for the unflagging care and devotion which they have brought to the performance of their self-imposed task.

Particular diseases.CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 7 and their consequences, of which it is sufficient to say here that they are entirely satisfactory, and that nothing occurred during the year which could suggest a thought of preventable mortality. Dr. McLeod, the first surgeon, thinks that a misapprehension has arisen as to the teaching, by him, of a system which his pupils will find impracticable in private life. He now writes: "What I do teach and practice is not the Listerian method, but the Listerian principle of asepsis and its advantages. I have not in one single case, since I became First Surgeon, carried out the Listerian method in all its details * * it is only in large and delicate operations that I resort to some of the more complicated Listerian materials and methods. I have found that students are able intelligently and effectively to follow even the more complicated plans of dressing in private practice; and as regards the simpler, I cannot conceive anything less difficult or expensive, except the open system which I also teach and illustrate, than that which I employ in most cases. I trust, therefore, that the surgeon-general and Government will be pleased to cancel the censure which the sentences which I have quoted might be understood to imply." The reference here is to the words of the resolution on the report for 1882, paragraph 6: "Dr. McLeod, in the first ward, carried out the Listerian method in its entirety;" and paragraph 7: "The advantage of strict Listerism seems doubtful in hospital practice; while, as a system to be taught exclusively to pupils, it is not desirable." 14. I am sure that the Lieutenant-Governor, in producing these words from my report, had no more intention of implying censure than I had in writing them. It was intended merely to point out that the public usefulness of a method depends on other considerations besides its efficacy. It would seem that there is some distinction to be drawn between "strict Listerism8 REPORT ON THE STATEMENT NO. VII. ENTERIC FEVER.

General improvement.16 REPORT ON THE in regard to which the superintendent writes: "Early in the year cholera broke out on several occasions among the patients in hospital. Some of the persons attacked had been long enough in hospital to forbid suspicion of their having brought the disease in with them. All ordinary precautions were adopted, but every now and again a case would continue to crop up. This state of affairs caused much anxiety, and having taken precautions to render the purity of the milk above suspicion, "I determined," says Dr. Birch, "after consultation with you to stop the supply of bazar butter and milk. Consequently I abolished the contracts for these articles, and made arrangements to keep cows in the hospital compound and to have them milked daily under European supervision, utilizing convalescent patients for the purpose. I further, from that time, purchased only European or New Zealand tinned butter. We have had no cholera occurring in the wards since March last. I do not mean to argue that these changes in management have been the un- doubted cause, but it is remarkable that there has been immunity since the new order of things. But our expenses have been very materially increased by the changes indicated. 75. Establishment.CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 17 CALCUTTA POLICE HOSPITAL. 80. Surgeon-Major F. C. Nicholson officiated in charge from 1st January to 9th April, on which date he was relieved by Dr. S. C. Mackenzie, who continu- ed till the end of the year. 81. The strength of the police force in 1883 was 2,801 against 2,806 in the preceding year. Admissions into hospital numbered 2,231 against 2,394 in 1882 and 2,589 in 1881. This shows that there had been a steady improvement in the general health of the police force. The ratio of admissions to total strength per 1,000 was 796 in 1883 against 853 and 922 in the two preceding years. The daily average number of sick in 1883 was 85 against 83 and 98 in 1882 and 1881 respectively. 82. There were 99 cases of venerial disease admitted against 77. The Con- tagious diseases act was not in operation. 83. The total number of deaths during the year was 28 against 33, 35 and 30 in the three preceding years. The percentage of deaths to admissions being 1.2 against 1.3 in 1882. The ratio of deaths to total strength was .99 in 1883 against 1.1 per cent in the previous year. The decrease was chiefly due to the absence of deaths from respiratory affections, of which there were 8 in 1882, and to the diminution in the number of fatal cases of dysentery, which were 3 against 7 in 1882. 84. The hospital buildings and its conservancy arrangements were in the same good order as they had been in the previous year. A second pucca privy connected with the drainage of the town was erected in the compound in place of the old kutcha one. 85. During the months of November and December 1883 there were 293 constables of the Bengal police force attached to the Calcutta reserve force for duty at the International Exhibition. A separate return of those who were admitted into hospital has been submitted. The number admitted was 68. Dr. Makenzie says that the percentage of admissions to total strength of the Calcutta police force during November and December 1883 was 20.84, while that of the portion of the Bengal police doing duty in Calcutta was 24.23 during the same period. No deaths occurred. MAYO HOSPITAL AND DISPENSARIES. 86. Surgeon-Major H.

E. D'S.MUNICIPAL DEPARTMENT. MEDICAL. CALCUTTA, THE 4TH AUGUST 1884. RESOLUTION. READ( 2 ) 2. The following table shows the number of patients treated in each of the hospitals during the year:(3) The death-rate from cholera was virtually the same as in the previous year, the numbers, both of cases and of deaths, rising in equal proportions. The general death-rate, excluding cholera, was the lowest of all the years in the series. The proportion of deaths per mille of total population was 28.4 against 30.4 in the previous year. The following table exhibits the true death-rate among natives, excluding the mortality from cholera and moribund cases:( 4 ) against 279 operations with 29 deaths in 1882. The Lieutenant-Governor entirely concurs in the remarks of the Surgeon-General regarding the practice of antiseptic treatment in this Hospital. In the Campbell Hospital, where a moderate use of antiseptics was made, the mortality after operations was very low. 7. The following statement shows the number of cases of enteric and remittent fever treated in each of the hospitals during the year:( 5 ) in 1882. Of these, 41 were from cholera, 11 from diarrh( 6 ) explained by Dr. Pilcher as follows:( 7 ) receipts from private sources amounted to Rs. 22,674, of which Rs. 6,679 was paid by the Port Trust for the diet of sick seamen, Rs. 2,200 by the Municipality, Rs. 1,598 was interest on investments, Rs. 12,186 was contributed by the East Indian Railway Company, British India Steam Navigation Company, and merchants, and Rs. 5,163 contributed by Government for European medicines, &c. Native subscriptions amounted to Rs. 10 only The total expenditure amounted to Rs. 24,639 against Rs. 23,634 in 1882, showing an increase of Rs. 1,005. Rupees 706 were expended on buildings. The actual amount expended on the sick was Rs. 23,933 as compared with Rs. 22,723 in 1882. The cost of establishment exceeded that of 1882 by Rs. 339. There was also an increase of Rs. 212 in the cost of bazar medicines and a decrease of Rs. 124 in the cost of diet. The average cost of each diet was 9 annas among Europeans and 2 annas 1 pie among natives, as compared with 9 annas and 1 anna 10 pie in the preceding year.

REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS FOR THE YEAR 1884. No. 5425. FROM A. J. COWIE, ESQ., Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Bengal, TO THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL, MUNICIPAL AND MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. Dated Calcutta, the 10th July 1885. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit the following report on the working of the Medical Institutions of Calcutta during the year 1884. 2. Of late years it has been customary to introduce in this place a table, shewing the deaths from the most prevalent diseases in the town of Calcutta. This is an excellent arrangement, as it assists in comparing notes with the results obtained from the municipal statistics of mortality. Deaths from the most prevalent diseases in the town of Calcutta. Cholera. Diarrh2 REPORT ON THE need of far greater activity on the part of those whose duty it is to protect the people. 4. All through the record in 1884 there was an augmentation in the number of deaths, save under the heading 3 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 8.

A comparison of the first and last columns points to a decrease in Euro- pean patients by .11 per cent. than before, Eurasians 1.02 per cent., an increase among Mahomedans and Hindus of .58 and .57 respectively, while "other races" fell slightly or by .02 per cent. The reduction chiefly occurred among Europeans and Eurasians, and was confined to the Medical College, Presidency General and Howrah Hospitals, to which these classes in the main resort. Dr. Birch ascribes the falling off in the General Hospital to a diminution in the paying patients. 14. The variable attendance at our hospital of Europeans, and Eurasians representing themselves to be Europeans, from year to year, is dependent upon definite causes. The amount of shipping in port, the state of trade, and employment in the market are the principal factors. STATEMENT No. III. Deaths in Calcutta Hospitals in 1884 and the seven previous years.

In the Medical College the death-rate of mixed adults was 119 per thousand, or greater by 11 than that of 1883. At the General Hospital the adult rate was 36.6 per thousand, and among children 111.84. In the Mayo the adult rate was 162.67 per thousand, and that of children 95.65. At the Campbell Hospital the adult rate was 242.49, and that of children 114.8 per thousand. At the Howrah Hospital the adult rate was 223.7 per thousand, and that of children 196.96. The total number of children treated in all the institutions during 1884 exceeded that registered in 1883 by 370, or at the rate of 67.7 per thousand against 52.79 in 1883. 18. The Police Hospital is a special hospital, and partakes more of the character of a native regimental one than a charitable institution. Its statistics, therefore, admit of no useful comparison with those of other hospitals. Here, however, it is worthy of note that the total sick of the force treated declined from 2,377 in 1883 to 2,221 in 1884, the deaths receding from 28 to 24 in the same period. The corresponding figures for the year 1882 were 2,438 and 33. 19. Particular Diseases.6 REPORT ON THE STATEMENT DISEASES. MEDICAL COLLEGE HOSPITAL. PRESIDENCY GENERAL HOSPITAL. Europeans. Natives.

8 REPORT ON THE 20. It will be observed that 206 persons died from phthisis, and 179 from "respiratory affections" during the year 1884. The frequency of chest maladies, and the heavy mortality they yield, call for remark. The exciting causes of pulmonary diseases are obscure. We notice epide- mic occurrence of pneumonia, for instance, in our cold damp weather, and at other times under conditions precisely the reverse. The disease is met with in our hospitals in both medical and surgical practice, and as a complication in the reduced and exhausted. The physical surroundings of many fatal cases outside our institutions lead to the conclusion that a vitiated state of the air breathed is one, if not the principal, factor in the causation of the disease, rather than, as is too often supposed, mere changes in the temperature or humidity of the atmosphere. The disorder is so frequently a concomitant during the progress of some diseases, that it is not unreasonable to believe the productive sources are alike. The deaths from pneumonia are not shewn separately in this statement. It is presumed they are included under the head of "Respiratory affections." The following very meagre information is all I can cull from the several annual reports. In 1884 pneumonia caused 3 deaths in the Medical College Hospital; the admissions are not given. In the General Hospital there was 1 fatal case, but the number of admissions is not recorded. In the Campbell Hospital 40 patients were admitted under treat- ment for this disease. No mention, however, has been made of the deaths. In the Police Hospital there were 10 cases and 2 deaths Very little is said in any of the reports on the prevalence of bronchitis, which occasions much sickness at certain seasons among all classes in Calcutta, either as a disease of first instance, or as the premonitory sign of pneumonia, asthma, pleurisy or pleuro-pneumonia, and phthisis. Again, the sequelæ of chronic bronchitis are by no means rare. It is a question of considerable interest how far this affection is related to so-called malarial exhalations or to tangible sanitary defects. 21. The total number of persons admitted into all the hospitals during 1884 suffering from diseases not specified, but entered under the heading "Other diseases" in the several orders of the nomenclature, was 5,182, or an increase of 397 over that recorded in 1883, the death-rate being 85.29 per 1,000 in 1884 against 74.19 in 1883. Of parturient women there were treated 421, of whom 33 died. The corresponding figures for 1883 were 371 and 8. STATEMENT No. VI. Campbell Hospital. Medical college Hospital. Howrah General Hospital.

The figures in this table furnish the true death-rate of native patients. The high rates for the Howrah and Campbell Hospitals must not be accepted as an equitable reckoning for comparison, for, be it remembered that, at these institutions many hopeless cases are admitted, which on terminating fatally go to swell the death-rates very materially. The enormous increase of "mori- bund" persons in the year 1884 is noticeable. The total number admitted was 497, the highest on record. The diseases which led to this mortality are nowhere defined. I presume therefore, that they are included in the "other diseases" alluded to in the last paragraph. 23. Operative Surgery.9 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 61 deaths. Ophthalmic operations are not here included. There were 4 cases of diphtheria admitted. All proved fatal. Tracheotomy was performed in each instance, but without effect. 4,505 minor operations were undertaken in the same period, and no deaths.

Dental practice.12 REPORT ON THE "The orders of the Government of Bengal were distinct that the number of pupils was to be limited only by the amount of accommodation available, and that as soon as suitable lodging could be found at the General Hospital, pupils should also be received there for general training in sick nursing, prior to their course at the Eden Hospital as midwives. * * * * The Committee beg me to state that they are prevented from any further increase in their nursing staff, owing to want of accommodation for more nurses. The quarters were built at the General Hospital for 24 nurses, and the build- ing is quite full. Two years ago the Government of Bengal sanctioned a plan and an estimate for joining the nurses' quarters to the Canning Home, thereby providing for six additional nurses, and also securing a covered way for the sisters from the Canning Home to the hospital through the nurses' quarters. As it is they are unprotected both from rain and sun. Apparently, though sanctioned, this scheme has been abandoned, and the Committee are anxious to represent that it is owing alone to want of more accommodation that further improvement in the Hospital Nurses13 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS.

A total increase of Rs. 41,251 is found under the heads of establishment, diet and miscellaneous charges, and a decrease of Rs. 32,619 under the heads of bazar and Europe medicines and of buildings and repairs. The difference shews an increase of Rs. 8,632 in the expenditure of 1884 over that of 1883. Details of income and expenditure in the several institutions were as follows:15 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. of patients and transfers of convalescents to the Eden Sanitarium, Darjeeling, the cause of extra purchases of furniture and hospital comforts and necessaries for the patients while in hospital.16 REPORT ON THE 70. The expenditure on dieting articles and stimulants amounted to Rs. 18,453 against Rs. 16,364 in 1883. The increase is stated to have been due to a larger number of patients having been treated, as well as to a larger number of small-pox cases having been admitted during the year under review than during the previous year. The cost of diet of each patient per diem was two annas two pie against two annas one pie in 1883. 71. The expenditure on miscellaneous items was Rs. 12,960 against Rs. 6,894 in 1883. The increase is attributed chiefly to the larger number of small-pox patients treated during the year, and to a larger outlay on bedding and clothing, hospital necessaries, contingencies, &c. 72. Building charges show a considerable decrease; the amount was Rs. 1,684 against Rs. 25,574 in 1883. 73. Police Hospital.17 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. Rs. 423. The amount expended in 1883 was Rs. 2,600. The accounts of the year closed with a cash balance of 5,760. 78. Howrah General Hospital.18 REPORT ON THE MEDICAL COLLEGE HOSPITAL. 83. Brigade-Surgeon J. M. Coates, M.D., was in charge of the hospital in 1884. Surgeon-Major K. McLeod was first Surgeon up to the 30th April 1884, when he went on furlough, handing over charge to Surgeon-Major D.O'.C. Raye, the Second Surgeon. The Second Surgeoncy was held by Sur- geon-Major D.O'.C. Raye till the 30th April 1884, excepting for a month when Dr. J.O'.Brien acted for him. Surgeon-Major J.O'.Brien, who again received the charge on 30th April continued till the end of the year. The Ophthalmic Surgeoncy was occupied by Brigade-Surgeon H. Cayley until 31st March 1884, when he handed over charge to Surgeon-Major R. C. Sanders. The Obstetric Physicianship was held by Surgeon-Major R. Harvey throughout the year, except for a month when Surgeon J. Clarke acted for him. 84. The total number of indoor patients treated in 1884 was 4,995 against 5,032 in the previous year. This is exclusive of ophthalmic cases. 85. There were 630 deaths, or a death-rate of 126.1 per 1,000, against 112 in 1883, and 123, 129, 128, 130, 135, and 108 in six preceding years. The rate of mortality in the year under report was, therefore, greater than that of the last two years, but less than that of the four previous years from 1878. There were 2,582 persons treated in the Christian wards with a daily average of 150.50, of whom 182 died, giving a death-rate of 70 per 1,000 as compared with 54, 59, 64, 69.6, 69.1, and 70 in six preceding years. The number of native indoor patients treated was 2,940 against 2,538, 2,660, and 2,593 in three previous years. The number of deaths was 448, or a rate of 152.38 per 1,000 against 169, 178, 185, 195, 190, and 215 in six preceding years. The following table exhibits the death-rates from principal diseases among Christians and natives in 1884 and in three previous years:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS 19 Surgeon-Major R. C. Sanders acted for him. There were several changes in the office of the first resident surgeon. Dr. Nicholson held the office from 1st January to 26th February; Dr. W. Beatson from 27th February to 3rd March; Dr. E. G. Russell from 4th March to 18th December; Dr. R. D. Murray from 19th to 31st December 1884. Dr. Harris was the second resident surgeon throughout the year. 93. The total number of patients treated during the year was 3,073 against 3,121 in 1883. They may be classified as follows:20 REPORT ON THE Superintendent says that since March 1883 he made special arrangements with regard to the supply of milk, butter, and drinking water. The cows are now kept in the compound and milked under immediate European supervision, butter comes from Italy or Australia, and it is purchased in tins from Messrs. Mackenzie, Lyall and Company. 101. There are a few new works required. Dr. Birch says:21 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 107. There was some change in the diet scale of the hospital. There was an increase of cost under the heads of diets and extras, owing to a larger number of patients having been treated during the year under review than in 1883. The slight increase in the cost of diet per patient, per diem, was due to a larger number of cases of small-pox requiring milk and other extras having been admitted during the year than during the previous year. 108. Dr. Mackenzie reports that the alterations required in the new cook-house built for the hospital during 1883 were not finished by the Public Works Department until the end of 1884. A new pucca cook-house for the small-pox wards was commenced during the year, and will be finished early in 1885. The accommodation in the general wards was the same as in the previous year. Extensive additions and alterations were sanctioned during the year for the European and Native small-pox wards of the hospital; a portion of them is to be finished before the end of the financial year 1884-85, and the remaining portion is to be undertaken during the official year 1885-86. Special wards for the accommodation of surgical and obstetric cases, and some separate rooms to segregate special cases, are said to be still required, but on account of funds not being available the works have had to be kept in abeyance. 109. The land around the small-pox wards is said to require levelling and drainage. Lighting and conservancy arrangements were the same as in previous years. CALCUTTA POLICE HOSPITAL. 110. Surgeon-Major S. C. Mackenzie, M.D., was in charge of the hospital throughout the year. 111. The strength of the police force in 1884 was 2,827 against 2,801 in the preceding year. Admissions into hospital numbered 2,079 against 2,231 in 1883 and 2,394 in 1882. This shows a decrease of 152 admissions as compared with that of the previous year, and of 315 with that of 1882. The steady improvement in the general health of the police force noticed last year thus continues. The ratio of admissions to total strength per 1,000 was 735 in 1884 against 796 and 853 in the two preceding years. The daily average number of sick in 1884 was 82 against 85 and 83 in 1883 and 1882, respectively, thus shewing a decrease of 3 during the year as com- pared with 1883. The prevailing diseases during the year were ague, dysen- tery, and venereal affections. There were 110 cases of venereal disease admitted against 99. There were only 2 cases of small-pox among the native members of the police force. Of these one case was of the discrete and the other of the modified variety. The disease occurred during the month of February. All the unprotected constables of the police were vaccinated during the months of November and December by the officers of the Vaccine Department. 112. There were 10 cases of cholera admitted into hospital against 18 in 1883. Of these 10 patients, 4, or 40 per cent., died, while during the previous year 50 per cent. succumbed. 113. The total number of deaths during the year was 24 against 28, 33, and 35 in the three preceding years. The percentage of deaths to admissions being 1.1 against 1.2 in 1883. The ratio of deaths to total strength was .84 in 1884 against .99 per cent. in the previous year. 114. The hospital buildings and its conservancy arrangements were in the same good order throughout the year as reported before. It is reported that "a new pucca dead-house was erected in the compound, to replace the old wooden dead-cart of the hospital, which had become rotten and useless." A new pucca godown was also built to contain the hospital clothing and bedding, and the old clothes godown was converted into a guard-room for the native officer and the police guards attached to the hospital. The compound of the hospital was in good order. 115. There was no special hospital for the European members of the force. Those who suffered from trivial complaints were treated in their barracks by the Police Surgeon, while those who required to go to hospital were transferred to the General Hospital for treatment.
22 REPORT ON THE 116. During the months of January and February, and up to the middle of March 1884, there were 210 constables of the Bengal Police attached to the Calcutta Reserve Force for duty at the International Exhibition. As this force was stationed in Calcutta only while the Exhibition remained open, a separate return has been submitted of those that were admitted in hospital. The number of admissions was 68. There were no deaths among them. MAYO HOSPITAL AND DISPENSARIES. 117. Brigade Surgeon H. Cayley was the Superintendent of the hospital and dispensaries from 1st January to 31st March 1884, when he was relieved by Surgeon-Major R. C. Sanders, who continued in charge till the end of the year. 118. Mayo Hospital.23 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. with the previous year, there was a decrease both in the in-door and out-door patients on the European as well as on the native side. 128. With regard to the decrease in the number of patients, Dr. Pilcher says that "the figures do not call for any special explanation, except to note that the diminished numbers are apparently due to a more healthy season, and diminished sickness among Europeans and natives during the year." Three hundred and fifty-four European seamen were treated against 342 in 1883. There were ten women confined in the hospital during the year, of whom none died. 129.

Reg. No. 1455JMUNICIPAL DEPARTMENT. MEDICAL. DARJEELING, THE 18TH SEPTEMBER 1885. RESOLUTION. READ( 2 ) There was a considerable increase both in the number of cholera and small-pox cases treated in the hospitals, the number under each of these heads being 1,023 and 275 against 932 and 111 respectively in the year 1883. The death-rate, however, under both heads was lower than that of the previous year, being 523 and 312 per mille against 547 and 315 per mille respectively. The number of fever cases fell from 4,141 in 1883 to 3,887 in the year under report; but the number of deaths from this cause rose from 323 in 1883 to 348 in 1884. 2. The following table shows the total number of persons treated, both as in-door and out-door patients, in the several hospitals in Calcutta during the past two years, and the number of deaths which occurred among those under treatment:(3) 5. The mortuary statistics of Calcutta for 1884 show the year to have been unusually unhealthy, and it is not, therefore, surprising to learn that the number of sick in hospital rose from 19,872 to 20,833, and that the death-rate among them was 127 against 116 in 1883. As regards the particular diseases treated at the hospitals, the Inspector-General makes the following remarks:( 4 ) At the Mayo Hospital 229 major and 12,783 minor operations were per- formed during the year. In 23 cases the major operations were attended with death. At the Campbell and Howrah General Hospitals 168 and 40 major and 259 and 997 minor operations, respectively, were performed during the year. The number of fatal cases at each of these institutions was 12 and 9 respec- tively. 8. The Lieutenant-Governor observes with satisfaction the growing use- fulness of the Eden Hospital, which is attached to the Medical College Hospital. The rapidity with which this institution is growing in popular estimation is a sure indication that its establishment has fulfilled a public want. The number of women and children treated during the year was 1,390 against 1,300 in the previous year. Of the total number, 890 were Europeans and 500 natives. The deaths among the former amounted to 37, and among the latter to 40. The number of confinement cases rose from 314 in 1883 to 379 in 1884. The mortality among this class of cases was, however, heavier, there being 29 deaths against 12 in the previous year. The reason assigned for this increase is that many of the cases were admitted in a very hopeless condition. There were nine cases of septicæmia, all of which proved fatal. In four of these cases the disease had been contracted before admission. Owing to the increasing number of native patients seeking admission, the lower portion of the hospital was opened during the year. 9. The system of nursing which has now been established at the Medical College and General Hospitals, under the immediate superintendence of the Ladies of the Clewer Sisterhood, is deservedly spoken of in the highest possible terms. The Ladies( 5 ) the Port Fund exceeded those of the previous year by Rs. 3,136. The net cost to Government, exclusive of the salaries of the Covenanted Medical Officers, was Rs. 42,199. The total expenditure during the year was Rs. 1,36,237 against Rs. 1,23,126 in 1883. The increase was chiefly due to the expenditure under buildings and repairs. "Besides quadrennial repairs to the central building, converting eastern and western building into private wards, dis- mantling old guard-room and cook-house, and constructing partition wall and brick nogging partition, the Calcutta filtered water was laid on." The average cost of daily diet was 7 annas and 9 pies, the same as it was in the previous year. 13. The total receipts from local sources at the Campbell Hospital amounted to Rs. 33,384, of which Rs. 30,000 were paid by the Municipality, and the remainder from port funds, paying-patients, sale of medicines, &c. Government contributed Rs. 27,340 against Rs. 44,437 in 1883. The total expenditure amounted to Rs. 60,724 against Rs. 75,868 in the previous year. This decrease is only due to a less amount having been expended on "buildings and repairs" than was expended in 1883. In all other items there was an increase of expenditure, which is said to be due to the large accession in the number of small-pox cases treated during the year. 14. The total expenditure incurred at the Police Hospital during the year was Rs. 15,786 against Rs. 16,685 in 1883, showing a decrease of Rs. 899. Of the total amount expended, five-sixths were paid by the Calcutta and Suburban Municipalities and one-sixth by Government. The daily cost per head was the same as in the previous year, viz., 2 annas and 2 pies. The expenditure on clothing fell from Rs. 554 in 1883 to Rs. 231 in the year under report. 15. The total income from local sources of the Mayo Hospital and its dispensaries during the year amounted to Rs. 23,304, of which Rs. 16,858 represented interest on investments. The invested capital of the institution at the close of the year stood at Rs. 3,47,400, or Rs. 5,000 more than it was at the beginning of the year. The amount contributed by Government was Rs. 37,366. The total expenditure amounted to Rs. 56,745 against Rs. 55,124 in 1883. Deducting the amount spent on buildings in the two years, the expenditure was Rs. 54,568 against Rs. 52,524. Of the total expenditure, Government contributed 66 per cent., the remaining 34 per cent. having been met from the private funds of the institution. The surplus balance at the close of the year was Rs. 5,760. The Lieutenant-Governor agrees with the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals in thinking that the time has arrived for reconsidering the Government grant to this institution. If the amount of savings which are being annually invested were utilized in defraying the expenses of the Hospital, so large a contribution from Govern- ment as is now being given will not be necessary. The Inspector-General will be requested to forward a special report on this matter. 16. At the Howrah General Hospital the total income from private sources during the year amounted to Rs. 21,292 against Rs. 22,674 and Rs. 22,885 in the two preceding years. Of the total amount received, Rs. 6,486 were paid by the Port Trust for diet of sick seamen, Rs. 2,600 by the Muni- cipality, Rs. 1,680 were derived as interest on investments, Rs. 10,495 were received as subscriptions from Europeans, and Rs. 31 as subscriptions from natives. Government contributed Rs. 4,413 in the shape of European medi- cines, registers and forms, diet of police cases, salaries and special allowances. The total expenditure amounted to Rs. 25,499 against Rs. 24,639 in 1883. The increase was chiefly due to a larger amount being spent on "buildings and repairs." There was an increase of Rs. 377 in the cost of establishment. The average cost of each diet was 8 annas and 3 pies in the case of Europeans, and 2 annas and 3 pies in the case of natives. The corresponding figures in the previous year were 9 annas, and 2 annas and 1 pie respectively. By order of the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, J. WARE EDGAR, Offg. Secretary to the Govt. of Bengal.

REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS FOR THE YEAR 1885. No. 5003. FROM A. J. COWIE, ESQ., Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Bengal, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL, MEDICAL AND MUNICIPAL DEPARTMENTS. Dated Calcutta, the 26th July 1886. SIR, I HAVE the honour to forward my report on the working of the Medical Institutions of Calcutta for the year 1885. 2. The report is late in its submission. The delay has been unavoidable. No unnecessary time has been wasted in its preparation. I am still sanguine that the Hon'ble the Lieutenant-Governor will deem it right to reconsider my earnest appeals and sanction the strengthening of my establishment, that my office may be placed on a footing consistent with the work to be done, and thus enable me to fulfil my functions as administrative head of the Provincial Medical Service, with despatch and. in an efficient manner. 3. In Mr. Secretary Edgar's, letter, No. 608, dated, 8th February, 1886, the Hon'ble the Lieutenant-Governor directed that the Annual Report on the "Syphilitic Hospitals" is to be incorporated in future with the report on the Calcutta Medical Institutions. For the first time the results in the whole of the large medical institutions, including the voluntary lock hospitals, are reviewed together in this report. 4. To assist in comparing notes with the results obtained from the municipal statistics of mortality, I introduce here a table exhibiting the deaths from the most prevalent diseases shewn in the mortuary returns of the Health Officer. Deaths from the most prevalent diseases in the town of Calcutta. Cholera. Diarrh2 REPORT ON THE 5. As I remarked last year, this report deals mainly with the adminis- tration, &c., of our hospitals, and not with the prevalence of disease in their neighbourhood and general vital statistics. I shall confine myself therefore, to a few comments on the salient features in this return, which occur to me as bearing on the mortality in the Medical Institutions of Calcutta, casually alluding to the sanitary state of things in the city in connection therewith. 6. General mortality of the town.3 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. most unsanitary wards of the town and suburbs, and that many die of foul air and defective diet, goes without the saying, Eliminating, therefore, the excess mortality from these causes, which will possibly be found to have been of exceptional occurrence, the general health of the inhabitants who reside in those portions of the city to which sanitary improvements have been extended was fairly good throughout the year. Owing to disturbing influences, such as numbers of the poverty-stricken temporarily seeking the shelter and support which a large city is felt to afford, the mortality registered within municipal limits, in any given period, is unreliable as a true standard of the salubrity of the city proper.

Of this increase the Medical College Hospgital contributed the largest share, Howrah came next, while in the Mayo Hospital and its dispensaries there was a large fall in the recorded numbers treated. 13. At the Medical College Hospital in 1885 in the surgical dispensary 12.694 cases were treated against 11,804 in 1884. In the medical dispensary the numbers were 18,029 in 1885 and 15,989 in 1884. Of dental cases 1,413 were treated as against 1,374. The duty-room and ophthalmic out-patient department show a decrease of between 500 and 600 each on the year's working. No explanation of the falling off in the numbers treated in these departments has been given. 14. The attendance of out-patients at the Mayo Hospital itself is returned in steady decreasing numbers:5 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. continuing as the season advanced, I deemed it proper to sanction, in anticipa- tion of orders, the erection, in the compound, of a large temporary ward. The building was quickly run up and equipped by Dr. Mackenzie, the Super- intendent. It proved very opportune, and fully met all requirements. At the close of the year there were under treatment in excess of accommo- dation 48. It was considered that the increase of patients at the Campbell Hospital was in the main due to distress in the flooded districts and its consequences. This seems a reasonable explanation, and if really the true one, then the excess of sickness may be set down as the outcome of excep- tional causes, and we may look forward to the early closing of the temporary ward. 19. The total house-patients treated in the Voluntary Lock hospitals, European and Natives, during 1885 is recorded as follows:6 REPORT ON THE STATEMENT No. III.

The total number of children treated in all the institutions exceeded those registered in 1884 by 100, or at the rate of 56.4 per thousand, against 57.4 in 1884. 28. The police hospital, as I have already remarked, is not a charitable institution of Calcutta. Its statistics admit of no useful comparison with those of the Calcutta institutions. The total sick treated rose from 2,221 in 1884 to 2,329 in 1885, while the deaths recorded rose from 24 to 28 in the same periods. 29.

In the front of the return it will be observed that 48 Europeans are set down as having been admitted under treatment. On requesting to be furnished with the particulars of these cases, Dr. Mackenzie supplied the following information:15 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. Septic disease was represented by four deaths. Erysipelas caused three deaths in 1885. The disease first appeared in the month of November in the First Surgeon's Wards, and subsequently spread by infection. The total number of cases attacked was six. The disease was happily, quickly stamped out by the early precautions and sanitary measures adopted. Dr. Coates reports that, Erysipelas first attacked a Mrs. C., who was suffering from a carbuncle. This was on the 10th November. Her husband, who visited the hospital daily, was in attendance at home on a sister-in-law labouring under erysipelas. The disease was evidently conveyed into the hospital by this man. 42. Dr. McLeod has kindly furnished me with the following particulars of the outbreak, &c.16 REPORT ON THE 48. The College Hospital , as a building, is "en bloc," "en messe." Were it built on any principle of segmentation, like all modern hospitals, then it would be possible to utilize a segment for the detention and treatment of contagious cases. This, however, is quite out of the question here. The only way, therefore, of protecting surgical cases from danger is to refuse admission to all patients from whom infection might arise, and transfer them, if already in hospital, to the cell wards abovementioned: But this would not be right, nor would it be just to the medical staff, who are working so earnestly in the interests of the Public and of the Government. 49. The retention of such cases among the general mass of surgical cases involves risks which ought not to be run. In my opinion17 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. former 35, and of the latter 32, died. The figures last year stood at 1,390, 890, 500, and 37 and 40 respectively. The total number of women treated was 1,241 with 39 deaths. 55. There were 432 confinements with 22 deaths in 1885. The correspond- ing numbers for 1884 were 379 and 29, or a mortality of 5.09 against 7.65 in the latter year. This reduction in the death-rate is a vast improvement. What greater proof do we want of the extreme cleanliness, the admirable nursing and perfect hygienic condition of the hospital itself? As a lying-in institution in the above respects its condition is not to be excelled. In a special hospital of this description we must not look for a low death-rate. Many poor women are admitted in a hopeless state. 56. Four cases of "septic18 REPORT ON THE 62.

No expenses should be incurred by Government which already maintains other large medical institutions in the city: and in a report called for by the Local Government recently, in regard to the subject of reduc- tion of Government expenditure which is being considered by the present Finance Committee, I have recommended that this hospital be made over to the Calcutta Municipality to be managed and supported entirely by that body. 104. The total expenditure in 1885 was Rs. 74,865, against Rs. 60,724 in 1884. Excluding the amount expended on buildings and repairs, the amount spent in ordinary requirements of the hospital was Rs. 60,804, against Rs. 59,040 in 1884. The expenditure on all items, excepting miscellaneous charges, shows increase. 105. The cost of establishment was Rs. 25,236, against Rs. 25,216 in 1884. The small increase under this head is said to have been due to the entertain- ment of an extra establishment "for the care of the large increase in the daily average sick." 106. The cost of bazar and Europe medicines was Rs. 240 and Rs. 2,664, against Rs. 225 and Rs. 2,183 in 1884, respectively. The increase is attributed to the higher daily average number of patients in 1885. 107. The expenditure on dieting articles and stimulants amounted to Rs. 21,765, against Rs. 18,453 in 1884, showing an increase of Rs. 3,312. The increase was due, it is said, to a larger number of patients having been treated in 1885, as well as to an increase in the price of milk and other articles of diet. The cost of diet of each patient per diem was 2 annas 3 pie against 2 annas 2 pie in the previous year. 108. The expenditure on miscellaneous charges was Rs. 10,898, against Rs. 12,960 in 1884, showing a decrease of Rs. 2,062. 109. The charges on account of buildings were Rs. 14,061, against Rs. 1,684 in 1884. This amount shows an increase of Rs. 12,377 over the figures of the year 1884. The increase is said to have been due to the construction of a clothing godown in the dispensary, to building a thatched shed as a temporary ward to relieve overcrowding in the general ward, and to additions and alterations in the cooking range of the general and small-pox wards. The following shows what the Government have spent on this hospital towards building and repairs in the last nine years:24 REPORT ON THE the institutions 36.6 per cent. In 1884 the corresponding figures were 66 and 34. The income from local sources amounted to Rs. 21,039, of which Rs. 16,958 were received as interest on investments. Rupees 3,716 were received as European and native subscriptions against Rs. 6,381 in 1884. 112. The expenditure on establishment was Rs. 32,224, against Rs. 31,598 in 1884. This shows an increase of Rs. 626 over the figures of 1884, which is said to have been due to the pay of two officers being increased by the orders of the Governors. Bazar medicines cost Rs. 1,944 against Rs. 1,924 in the previous year. The increase is not explained. Europe medicines cost Rs. 8,195, against Rs. 6,556 in 1884, shewing an increase of Rs. 1,639, which is explained to have been due to a greater number of surgical instruments imported, and quinine used in larger quantities. Dieting articles cost Rs. 6,562, against Rs. 6,456 in 1884, shewing an increase of Rs. 106. The increase was due, it is said, to 1,217 more patients being dieted. The average cost of each diet was the same as in the previous year, viz., 2 annas 10 pies. The charges on miscellaneous items were Rs. 9,742 or Rs. 1,709 in excess of that of 1884. The increase is said to have been due to new beds, gas fittings, and gas being supplied. Building charges were less than those of 1884 by Rs. 1,945. The amount expended in 1884 was Rs. 2,177. There remained at the end of the year a cash balance of Rs. 5,266. 113. The expenditure on these institutions and the Government con- tributions towards their support are matters that have lately arrested the attention of Government. The following statement will show to what extent the invested funds have increased in the past eight years, as well as the cash balances at the end of every one of those years:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 25 and in 1885 it was Rs. 58,900. This fact of the yearly increase since 1883 therefore gives the subject in question increased importance no doubt. The increase under the different heads of expenditure in 1885 has been explained by the Superintendent; but considering that these institutions are maintained chiefly for out-door patients, the in-patient relief, though gradually increasing, being very small, it would not be unreasonable to expect some reductions in the expenditure. 117. The out-door relief has been gradually diminishing since 1878 as will be seen from the following:26 REPORT ON THE was due, it is explained, to replacements of some of the instruments which had worn out. The cost of dieting articles rose from Rs. 4,251 in 1884 to Rs. 4,889 in 1885. The increase of Rs. 638 was due, it is said, "to a larger daily average number of patients treated during 1885, to larger number of severe cases which required extra nourishment, to the increase in the number of patients suffering from venereal diseases who had to be fed on full diets, and to the prices of some of the articles of diet having been higher during the year." The cost per head per diem was 2 annas 4 pie against 2 annas 2 pie in 1884. Miscellaneous charges amounted to Rs. 370 against Rs. 591. Building charges were less by Rs. 1,217 than that of the previous year. 123. Excluding the cost of building and repairs, the gross expendi- ture of this hospital amounted to Rs. 14,426, against Rs. 13,911 in 1884. Of these sums, on establishment alone, Rs. 8,801 and Rs. 8,814, respectively, were spent, amounts which in relation to the total expenditure and the daily average sick appear certainly very disproportionate and large. It would seem, therefore, that some reduction of expenditure is feasible here. The municipality, however, pay nearly the whole of the cost; and should the Government make over the Campbell hospital and Mayo institutions to the Calcutta Municipality, that body would no doubt consider whether it is desirable to keep up this police hospital any longer at so large a cost, should they still continue to pay what is known as "Police charges," or to abolish it, transferring the sick of the police force together with their police hospital contributions to the several medical institutions entrusted to their care. Similar considerations may weigh with the Government if the "Police charges" be remitted to the municipalities and the cost of this police hospital fall entirely upon Government. In my report regarding the directions in which medical expenditure may be reduced, I did not hint at any of the above suggestions for very obvious reasons. I only pointed out since Government contributes towards the police hospital, that the supervision of the institution may be given to an uncovenanted officer, making it of course thereby less costly than it is at present. 124.

The contributions of Government for the past seven years are as follows:28 REPORT ON THE review. Miscellaneous charges amounted to Rs. 1,133 against Rs. 941 in 1884, shewing an increase of Rs. 192, which is said to have been due to the re-roping of bottoms of many of the hospital cots which had worn out; to the purchase of more deckchies and cloth for dressing purposes for more patients; to the renewal of most of the blankets and pillow-cases and clothing of the European patients which had worn out; to the re-matting of the matron29 CALCUTTA MEDICAL NSTITUTIONS.

McConnell held the office of Second Physician from 1st January to 4th April. From 5th April to 26th June the office was held by Surgeon-Major R. C. Chandra; from 27th June to 5th July by Surgeon J. B. Gibbons, and from 6th July to close of the year by Surgeon-Major J. F. P. McConnell. Surgeon-Major D. O'Connell Raye was First Surgeon up to the 25th October 1885, and from 26th to the close of the year the First Surgeoncy was held by Surgeon-Major K. McLeod. The Second Surgeoncy was held by Surgeon-Major J. O'Brien up to the 25th October 1885, and from 26th till the end of the year by Surgeon-Major D. O'Connell Raye. Surgeon-Major R. C. Sanders held the Ophthalmic Surgeoncy throughout the year. The Obstetric Physicianship was held by Surgeon-Major R. Harvey up to the 18th March 1885, and again from the 27th October till the close of the year. Surgeon- Major C. J. H. Joubert acted in the interval. 137. The total number of in-door patients treated in 1885 was 5,373 against 4,995 in the previous year. This is exclusive of ophthalmic cases. 138. There were 561 deaths, or a death-rate of 104.4 per 1,000 against 126.1 in 1884, and 112, 123, 129, 128, 130, and 135 in six preceding years. The rate of mortality in the year under report was the lowest on record since the year 1878. There were 2,757 persons treated in the European wards, with a daily average of 157.26, of whom 163 died, giving a death-rate of 59 per 1,000 as compared with 70, 54, 59, 64, 69.6 and 69.1 in six preceding years. The number of native in-door patients treated was 3,140 against 2,940, 2,538 and 2,660 in three preceding years. The number of deaths was 398, or a rate of 126.75 per 1,000 against 152.38, 169, 178, 185, 195, and 190, in six preceding years. The following table exhibits the death-rates from the principal diseases among Christians and natives in 1885 and in three previous years:30 REPORT ON THE 143. The total number of paying patients in 1885 shows an increase of one, and their payments, as compared with the three preceding years, were as follow:31 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 1884 and 4 with 1883. The prevailing diseases during the year were ague, dysentery and venereal affections. There were 129 cases of venereal diseases admitted against 110 in 1884. There was only one case of small-pox in 1885. The constable, who belonged to the River Police, had con- fluent small-pox, and died in the maturative stage of the affection. The Police Surgeon remarks, "although he had been seven years in the police force, he had not apparently been vaccinated." The unprotected constables were, it is reported, vaccinated during the month of November by the officers of the Vaccine Department. There were seven cases of cholera admitted into hospital during the year under report against 10 in 1884. Of the seven cases, one, or 14 per cent. died, while during 1884, 40 per cent. succumbed. 153. The total number of deaths during the year was 28 against 24, 28 and 33 in the three preceding years, the percentage of deaths to admissions being 1.2 against 1.1 in 1884. The ratio of deaths to total strength was .98 in 1885 against .84 in 1884. 154. The hospital buildings and its conservancy arrangements were in good order. A room for the civil hospital assistant and compounder on duty was built during the year. A verandah was constructed in front of the cloth godown built in 1884. The introduction of kerosine oil in the lighting of the wards effected a considerable saving. The light afforded by the kerosine oil lamps was, it is said, brighter than that obtained from the old castor oil lamps. Dr. Mackenzie reports that the change was in every way found to be satisfactory. The compound of the hospital was in good order. 155. There was no special hospital for the European members of the force. Those who suffered from trivial complaints were treated in their barracks by the Police Surgeon, while those who required to go to hospital were transferred to the General and Medical College hospitals for treatment. MAYO HOSPITAL AND DISPENSARIES. 156. Surgeon-Major R. C. Sanders was in charge of these institutions throughout the year. 157. Mayo Hospital.32 REPORT ON THE 162.

The death-rate among the European in-patients was less as compared with the figures of 1884, 1882, and 1881, while it was higher than that of 1883. 169. Among natives the death-rate was less than in the previous year, while it was higher than those of 1881, 1882 and 1883. Of the 300 deaths, 79 occurred in the first 24 hours after admission, and only 99 deaths occurred among patients who had been in the hospital over ten days. The greater number of deaths among natives (moribind) was due to bowel-complaints and cholera. 170. About the drainage and conservancy arrangements Dr. Pilcher says:APPENDIX

MUNICIPAL DEPARTMENT. MEDICAL. DARJEELING, THE 30TH OCTOBER 1886. RESOLUTION. READ( 2 ) and if this is correct, the crowding should be temporary, and the necessity for the ward should shortly cease. This hospital still holds a number of persons suffering from blindness, and others who should be classed as incurables. The Superintendent should renew his efforts to transfer such persons to the charge of their friends and relative. 4. The number of in-patients treated in the voluntary lock-hospitals during 1885 was 414 against 333 in 1884, showing an increase of 81. The daily average number of patients treated was 90 against 61 in the previous year. This shows that each patient on the average continued in the hospital 79 days in 1885 and 68 days in 1884. Of the total number of in-door cases, 48 were Europeans and Eurasians and 366 natives. Ninety-three patients, viz., 48 Europeans and Eurasians and 45 natives, were treated in the Sealdah Lock- hospital, against 111, or 38 Europeans and 73 natives, in the previous year. Three hundred and twenty-one patients (natives) were treated in the Alipore lock-hospital, against 222 in 1884. The total number of admissions was 342, of which 100 were received on transfer from the Campbell Hospital. The corresponding numbers in 1884 were 279 and 75. There were 18 deaths among the native in-door patients, or a rate of 4.9 per cent. on total cases treated, against 21 and 6.3 per cent. in the preceding year. There were treated in the hospitals 1,889 out-door patients against 1,454 in 1884, the daily average number being 6.5 and 5.9 respectively. Of the total number of out-door cases, 39 were treated in the Sealdah Lock-hospitals, against 50 in 1884. Altogether 1,850 patients were treated in the Alipore Lock-hospitals, against 1,404 in the preceding year. Many cases of venereal disease are still treated at the other hospitals to the detriment of the patients of other classes for whom those institu- tions are chiefly intended. The Inspector-General will be requested to instruct the Principal of the Medical College and Superintendents of other hospitals to transfer as many patients as they can to the voluntary hospitals. 5. The results of the surgical operations in the Medical College Hospital were more satisfactory than those of the previous year. The number of operations performed in the hospital was 394, of which 30 cases proved fatal, against 416 operations with 52 deaths in 1884. Ophthalmic operations are not included in these figures. There were three deaths from erysipelas during the year. The disease broke out in November, having been imported by the husband of a patient, and spread by infection. Six cases in all occurred, of which three were fatal. Prompt measures were taken to segregate the sufferers and to disinfect the wards in which the outbreak occurred, and to purify the bedding, instruments, and other appliances through which contagion might be communicated. Dr. Cowie considers that the history of this small outbreak shows that the spread of erysipelas, once the most dreaded and fatal of all forms of hospitalism, is now completely under control, while its specific action can readily be destroyed or rendered harmless by antiseptic surgery and effective sanitary measures. He has pointed out, however, that the College Hospital, unlike most modern hospitals which are built on some principle of segmentation, is en bloc, and that at present scarcely any means exist for segre- gating infectious cases. This matter has already received the attention of Government, and the Inspector-General has been asked to submit plans and estimates for a suitable ward for cases of this character. 6. In the Eden Hospital 1,575 women and children were treated against 1,390 in the previous year. Of these, 1,064 were Europeans and 511 natives. The deaths among the former amounted to 35, and among the latter 32. The number of confinement cases rose from 379 to 432, the mortality among this class of cases being 22 against 29 in 1884. The reduction in the death-rate is satis- factory, as many patients were admitted in a hopeless state. The Lieutenant- Governor is satisfied with the general working of the hospital. It is stated that a steam laundry is required, as the present arrangements are defective. An estimate has been called for; but the Lieutenant-Governor fears that with so many urgent calls upon the Provincial finances, it will be difficult to provide the necessary funds at present. 7. The total number of cases of enteric and remittent fever treated in all the hospitals during the year was 20 and 803 respectively, against 11 and 930, the corresponding figures of the previous year. Of the 20 cases of enteric (or typhoid) fever, 17 are shown as having been admitted into the Presidency
( 3 ) General Hospital, 1 into the Medical College Hospital, and 2 into the Police Hospital. These figures are, however, said to be unreliable owing to the diffi- culty of distinguishing between enteric and remittent fever, which, as Dr. Cleghorn, the Officiating Surgeon Superintendent of the Presidency General Hospital, remarks, "is due to the imperfect knowledge which we at present possess of the fevers of this country, and to a general belief in the widespread influence and prevalence of malaria." In order to overcome this difficulty, the Inspector-General strongly urges upon all medical officers the importance of a post-mortem examination in every case of death from remittent or suspected typhoid fever. 8. The nursing arrangements at the General and Medical College Hos- pitals continue to be managed by the Calcutta Hospital Nurses' Institution, under the supervision of the ladies of the Clewer Sisterhood. Drs. Cowie, Coates, Harvey, and Cleghorn all speak in the highest terms of the efficiency of the work done; and the Lieutenant-Governor desires to add his testimony to the valuable services which the institution has rendered to the cause of medical charity in Calcutta. 9. The invested capital of the Calcutta Hospitals was increased during the year from Rs. 5,53,300 to Rs. 5,54,300. The whole of this increase appertains to the Howrah General Hospital. The total expenditure, excluding the amount invested, was Rs. 4,23,236, which exceeded the amount expended in 1884 by Rs. 9,921. The net cost to Government of all the hospitals, including the volun- tary lock-hospitals, which are now entirely supported by Government, amounted to Rs. 2,71,349 against Rs. 2,70,400 in the previous year, inclusive of the cost of lock-hospitals, which was Rs. 16,185 in 1884. There was a total decrease of Rs. 16,057 in the Medical College, Police, and Presidency General Hospitals, and an increase of Rs. 17,006 in the Campbell, Howrah, and lock-hospitals, the total net increase being Rs. 949. Orders have separately been passed regard- ing the revision of the Government grants to the Mayo Hospital, which the Lieutenant-Governor has decided to reduce to Rs. 34,000 from the ensuing year.

REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS FOR THE YEAR 1887. No. 5574. FROM A. HILSON, ESQ., M.D., Offg. Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Bengal, To THE CHIEF SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL. Dated Calcutta, the 18th July 1888. SIR, IN presenting the report on the medical institutions of Calcutta for the past year, it is necessary to state that my knowledge of them is very limited from having so recently taken up the duties of my present appoint- ment, and I shall therefore not attempt to give a detailed account of all the work done in them, but will restrict my observations to a few remarks suggested by an inspection of the different tables and returns which are now submitted. 2. The past year has been one of unusual healthiness in the town of Calcutta, as will be seen from the following table, in which the death-rate for 1887 stands lower than it has done for the last twelve years; lower even than in 1886, which was admittedly a healthy year:2 REPORT ON THE to supply the deficiency, I have obtained an extract from the returns of the Sanitary Commissioner, which give the requisite information.

In the suburbs of Calcutta the total mortality was a little in excess of that of the previous year, the rate having been 42.17 against 40.51 in 1886. 5. The causes which have given rise to the increase or diminution of deaths in the different localities mentioned above will be dealt with by the Sanitary Commissioner and the Health Officer of Calcutta, and it is only necessary here to see how far the general health of the community in 1887, as indicated by the mortuary returns, has reacted on the attendance at the hospitals during the year.

It will be seen that the total number treated at all the institutions was 612 less than in the previous year, which corresponds with the slight diminution in the mortality of the town of Calcutta in 1887; but, strange to say, the total attendance is found to be larger than it was in 1884 or 1885, when the death-rate among the community was very high, and especially in the former year:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 3 The number of the institutions to which these figures apply have not increased during the last four years, and it will be noticed that while the death-rate among the community has been steadily falling, the attendance at the hospitals has generally been rising. 7. Taking each institution separately, the following results are ob- tained:4 REPORT ON THE Recorded deaths among the general population of the Town of Howrah.

This return shows that a very large diminution has taken place in the numbers of Europeans who sought relief at the hospitals during the year, and as the falling off is mainly confined to the males, it is probable that it has been caused by the depression of trade and the smaller number of sailors who visited the port. In other respects the figures of the return differ little from those of previous years. STATEMENT No. III. Deaths in Calcutta Hospitals in 1887 and the seven previous years. YEAR.

It will be seen that the total death-rate per mille for the combined institutions stands at 116, which is as low as it was in 1886, and much less than in any previous year since 1880. This accords with the diminished mortality in the town of Calcutta; but seeing that many of the patients treated in the hospitals, and notably those at Sealdah and Howrah, come from localities outside the boundaries of the Municipality, the figures cannot be used for purposes of comparison.

This return, which is intended to show separately the numbers of men, women and children admitted into each hospital, with the results of treatment, is not constructed in such a way as to admit of a ready comparison with that of 1886 and previous years, because the death-rate per mille of treated is not given. This defect in it should be rectified in future. 21. A noticeable feature in it, however, is the large increase in the number of children treated in the General Hospital, where one of the female wards is now set apart for them as mentioned by Dr. Cowie in his report of last year. In 1886 there were 180 children treated in this hospital with 14 deaths, and in 1887, 281 with 17 deaths, a most satisfactory improvement. 22. The number of deaths in the Campbell and Howrah hospitals have, as usual, been conspicuously large in proportion to the numbers treated, as might be expected from the wretched condition of many of the patients admitted into them.

There were no less than 96 such cases, while there were only 4 at the Medical College Hospital, 3 at the Campbell, and 5 at the Howrah Hospital. An analysis of these 96 cases reveals the following facts:18 REPORT ON THE it. I need not say that the occurrence of such cases has given me the liveliest grief, and been the cause of much anxious thought; everything that could be done was done to check and prevent them, and a special representation was made on the subject of the only possible assignable cause. I believe that in spite of all precautions we cannot hope to prevent their recurrence until arrangements for the washing of soiled bedding and linen are entirely remo- delled." 51. Dr. Harvey also says that there were an unusually large number of bad confinement cases requiring instrumental interference, which doubtless conduced to the higher mortality. 52. The total number of major operations was 135 against 153 in 1886, and of these 12 were cases of abdominal section, including six ovariotomies. 53. The want of a steam laundry, to which Dr. Harvey alludes in his report, is still much felt at this institution; and although its erection has been sanctioned by Government, nothing has yet been done, presumably from want of funds for the purpose. 54.

The diet charges were less owing mainly to the smaller number of Europeans who received food from the hospital. The miscellaneous expenses fell from Rs. 20,614-11-5 in 1886 to Rs. 12,569-3-10 in 1887, chiefly on account of the smaller expenditure on clothing. Buildings and repairs cost only Rs. 3,936-7-6 as against Rs. 7,506.7-1 in the previous year. Rupees 22,883 are entered as having been invested as already explained. The total expendi- ture of this institution was, exclusive of the sum invested, Rs. 1,02,778 as against Rs. 1,17,218 in 1886. 65. Choonee Lall Seal's Dispensary, which has an annual income of Rs. 2,000, shews a diminished expenditure owing to a saving in the cost of Europe medicines. 66.

There were treated in the hospitals 2,214 out-patients (natives), against 1,629 in 1886, showing an increase of 585 patients the daily average being 8.59, against 6.2 in the previous year. Of the total number of out-door patients, 13 (natives) were treated in the Sealdah Lock-hospital, against 38 in 1886. Two thousand two hundred and one patients (natives) were treated in the Alipore Lock-hospital, against 1,591 in the preceding year. There were 327 inter- current affections treated in the hospital among in-door patients during 1887, against 337 in 1886. The principal intercurrent affections wereRESOLUTION. MEDICAL Darjeeling, the 13th November 1888. READ( 2 ) death-rates are higher than in 1886, they are lower than in any other previous year since 1881. 6. The number of admissions from dysentery rose from 1,601 in 1886 to 1,703, but there were only 447 deaths, against 455 the year before. There were 612 admissions for cholera, which in 341 cases proved fatal. Mortality among the European patients treated for this disease was greater in the General Hospital than in the Medical College. The Inspector-General remarks "that this difference is not likely to be due to any particular mode of treatment, but probably to the more virulent character of disease among the class of patients admitted into the General Hospital." The Lieutenant-Governor is glad to find that there were no cases of cholera among the patients under treatment in the General Hospital( 3 ) increase in the number of deaths due to the prevalence of septicemia in the hospital, which has caused no less than 15 deaths. Dr. Harvey remarks that he believes all precautions to prevent the recurrence of this cause will be fruitless until better arrangements are made for the washing of soiled bedding and linen. The erection of a steam laundry has been sanctioned with a view to providing the requisite arrangements. 10.The Lieutenant-Governor is glad to find that the nurses employed in the hospitals continue to afford satisfaction, and that the superintendence exercised by the ladies of the Clewer Sisterhood is recognized in the reports of the medical officers of the different institutions as of the greatest value. The Honorary Secretary of the Hospital Nurses' Institution reported that the nurses employed in the Canning Hospital attended 54 cases of illness, in addition to their work at the hospital, and have earned for the institution a sum of Rs.7,011 in fees. The dhais also attended nine cases in native families. Two passed females of the North-Western Provinces Branch of Lady Dufferin's Fund have been sent to the Eden Hospital to be trained in midwifery. 11. The total invested capital of the institutions rose from Rs. 5,49,300 to Rs. 5,80,200. The increase appertains to the Medical College Hospital, Mayo Hospital, Ezra Hospital, and the Howrah General Hospital. The total income during the year, including opening balance, amounted to Rs. 4,45,839. Of this sum, Rs, 2,53,419 were contributed by Government. The total expen- diture fell from Rs. 4,37,671 to Rs. 3,99,069. The decrease falls mainly under the heads of diet, miscellaneous charges and buildings and repairs. Dieting expenses decreased considerably in the Medical, Presidency, and Campbell Hospitals, owing to the smaller number of patients. There was also a considerable reduction in the miscellaneous charges in the Medical and Presidency Hospitals. The increased expenditure on establishment in the Pre- sidency Hospital was due to the opening of a contagious diseases ward, and to the entertainment of extra establishments for cholera and small-pox cases. 12.

REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS FOR THE YEAR 1888. No. 6214. FROM A. HILSON, ESQ., M.D., Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Bengal, To THE CHIEF SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL. Dated Darjeeling, the 12th July 1889. SIR, IN submitting the annual report of the Medical Institutions of Calcutta for the past year, it is necessary to state that it has been written under considerable disadvantages, because having been employed in another part of India for some months past, I have not had an opportunity of making myself acquainted, by personal inspection, with many of the occurrences which have recently taken place in them. 2. The mortality of the town and suburbs of Calcutta, and also of Howrah, is given in the following table, from which it may be inferred that the health of the general population has not been so good as in the previous year. In most of these localities the death-rate has increased, chiefly from the greater prevalence of cholera and of those diseases classified under the heading of "other causes," while the number of deaths from fevers, bowel-complaints and small-pox has varied little from that of the previous year:2 REPORT ON THE 3. This greater unhealthiness was not accompanied by any increased number of patients treated in the hospitals, but with a very considerable diminution. The following statement shows the numbers treated in the Medical Institutions:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 3 7. This table is interesting, inasmuch as it shows that a much larger number of Europeans resorted to the hospital than in the previous year. An- other feature of the table is the diminution in the numbers of Hindu and Mahomedan women and children, and probably this may be due to the successful working of the out-door department of the Dufferin Hospital.

The large number of dislocations said to have been reduced is still a very remarkable feature of the surgical work at these institu- tions, but it is satisfactory to see that they have decreased to 75 from 96 in 1887. An analysis of these dislocations is given below:14 REPORT ON THE Natives. Remaining on 1st January 1888. Admitted. Total.

The total number of deaths out of the 1,669 patients treated was 77, or a rate of 46.13 per mille, which is a considerable improvement on the previous year, when the death-rate reached 60.36. Dr. Joubert, the Officiating Superintendent of the Hospital, has suggested that the death-rate of each class should be shown separately, as he has done this year in his annual report, because the heavy mortality that occurs among native children swells the general average to such an extent as to give an erroneous impression of the death-rate among the other patients. This system will be adhered to in future. 25. There were 513 confinements as against 439 in 1887, showing the growing popularity of the hospital. Of these 513, 224 were Europeans with four deaths. and 289 natives with 16 deaths. 26. There was a very satisfactory diminution in the number of cases of septicæmia, only three patients having developed the disease in hospital, while six had contracted it before admission. This makes a total of nine cases with three deaths, as compared with 18 cases and 15 deaths in 1887. In regard to the lessened prevalence of and mortality from this fatal disease, Dr. Joubert makes the following very interesting and instructive remarks in his annual report:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 15 fully endorse the high encomium which Dr. Joubert passes on Dr. Walsh, I am of opinion that very great credit is also due to Dr. Joubert himself. 27. The major operations at this institution rose from 135 in 1887 to 177 in 1888, and many of them were of a very important character, such as five ova- riotomies, 3 cases of abdominal sections, 14 plastic operations for fistula, and 3 secondary operations for ruptured perineum, as well as many others which will be found included in the general list of the Medical College Hospital. 28.

These sums are compared with those of the previous year in the subjoined table:18 REPORT ON THE 1887 to Rs. 24,747-0-0 in 1888, the increase of Rs. 20,810-8-6 being due to quadrennial repairs to the buildings and to original works. Miscellaneous charges showed an increase of Rs. 9,556-10-3, which is said to have been chiefly due to the renewal of the unserviceable clothing of the College and Eden Hospitals, to the payment of Rs. 7,485 as municipal taxes which were hitherto dealt with by the Accountant-General, and not accounted for in the financial transactions of the College Hospital, and to larger expendi- ture of bandage cloth, necessitated by the more frequent use of antiseptic dressings. The diet charges fell from Rs. 32,195-11-1 in 1887 to Rs. 31,855-14 in 1888, owing to the smaller number of Christian diets being issued. Bazar medicines show a small decrease. The total expenditure of the hospital was, exclusive of the cost of buildings and repairs and the amount invested, Rs. 1,11,848-0-7 against Rs. 98,842-4-5 in 1887. Rupees 506-0-4 were spent on investment during the year. Deducting this amount only, the total expenditure of the hospital amounted to Rs. 1,36,595-0-7 as against Rs. 1,02,778-11-11 in 1887. 40. Choonee Lall Seal's Dispensary, which has an annual income of Rs. 2,000, shews a small increase in the total expenditure, due to increased cost under the heads of Europe medicines and miscellaneous charges. The increase under these heads was due, it is said, to higher daily average number of patients treated and to more surgical work having been performed in 1888. Bazar medicines show a small decrease. 41. Presidency General Hospital.19 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. cheaper in 1888. There was a diminution of Rs. 2,651-9-2 under buildings and repairs, owing to fewer new works having been executed in the year under report. There was a small increase under bazar medicines. The cost of estab- lishment shows an increase of Rs. 852-15-1, which was chiefly due to the pay of the Superintendent while on three months' privilege leave having been debited to the hospital in addition to the pay of the medical officer who officiated for him. The increase of Rs. 390-13-8 under Europe medical stores is accounted for by the replacement of condemned surgical instruments and hospital neces- saries. Miscellaneous charges show an increase of Rs. 835-5-0 owing to the purchase of a larger number of blankets rendered necessary by the renewal of worn out ones and by the larger number of sick. The total expenditure was Rs. 61,454-2-4, against Rs. 62,555-4-10 in 1887, but if building charges be excluded, the figures are respectively Rs. 54,772-8-1 and Rs. 53,222-1-5. 44. Police Hospital.20 REPORT ON THE office was held by Surgeon G. Jameson. Surgeon-Major R. C. Sanders was Ophthalmic Surgeon from the beginning of the year to 31st March, when he went on furlough, making over charge to Surgeon F. F. Perry, who held charge of the office up to 30th November. Surgeon-Major R. C. Sanders was again Ophthalmic Surgeon from 1st December to the close of the year. The Obstet- ric Physicianship was held by Surgeon-Major R, Harvey from 1st January to 5th April, and by Surgeon C. H. Joubert from 6th April to the end of the year. 48. The total number of in-door patients treated, excluding the ophthalmic cases, was 5,749, against 5,544 in the previous year. There were 587 deaths, or a death-rate of 102.1 per mille, against 105.15 in 1887 and 101.8, 104.4, 126.1, 112, 123, and 129 in six preceding years. There were treated 2,865 persons in the European wards with a daily average of 147.57, of whom 129 died, giving a death-rate of 45 per 1,000 treated, as against 58.76, 49.3, 59, 70, 54 and 59 in six preceding years. There were treated 3,329 native in-door patients, against 3,043 in 1887, the daily average being 190 and 188.4 respec- tively. There were 458 deaths, or a rate of 137.5 per mille, against 135.39, 141.6, 126.75, 152.38, 169 and 178 in six preceding years. The following table exhibits the death-rates from the principal diseases among Christians and natives in 1888 and three preceding years:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 21 53.

There were treated 122 patients from venereal diseases, against 121 in 1887. The total number of deaths in 1888 was 30, against 23 in 1887, or a rate of 1.09 and 84 per cent. respectively in the two years. The cause of this increment in the death-rate was due, it is said, to a larger number of admissions and deaths from cholera during the year. 62. The hospital buildings were in good order throughout the year. Petty repairs to the buildings were executed, and a new bathing platform, supplied with unfiltered water, was erected in the compound for the use of the sick. A verandah was built to both cook-houses of the hospital, and two doors were opened in the east wall of the Hindoo cook-house for the purpose of giving light and air to the cooks when employed in preparing the patientsRESOLUTION. MEDICAL. Calcutta, the 12th August 1889. READ( 2 ) other institutions. 75 per cent. of those treated for cataract had good vision restored. Dr. Hilson justly remarks that it would have been more satisfactory if a larger portion of the important operations had been allotted to the Assistant Surgeons. In the Howrah Hospital only 59 major operations were performed during the year, owing in great measure to the indifferent health of the Superin- tendent, who should, however, have been able to get his subordinates to do more in this direction. 6. In the Eden Hospital 1,669 women and children were treated, against 1,607 in 1887, while the death-rate fell from 60.36 to 46.13. There were 513 confinements, of which 224 were Europeans, against 439 in 1887. There were only 9 cases of septicæmia, of which 6 were contracted before admission, with 3 deaths, against 18 cases and 15 deaths in 1887. Great credit appears to be due for this to Drs. Joubert and Walsh, who insisted on the most rigid precautions among nurses in the observance of antiseptic precautions after labour, and on the disinfection of all the linen of labour cases before sending it to the dhobee. A steam laundry is now in course of erection, which will shortly put an end to the present system of washing by dhobees. 7. The Ezra Hospital, which is chiefly intended for sick members of the Jewish persuasion, was opened for out-patients on the 12th March 1888, and for in-patients on the 9th April 1888: 1,134 out-door and 201 in-door patients were admitted during the year. 8. Sir Steuart Bayley is glad to find that the Medical Officers of the various institutions speak highly of the good services rendered by the nurses, for which the medical staff of the hospitals are largely indebted to Mrs. E.

The past year, as far as can be judged by the returns of mortality furnished by the Health Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, was not distin- guished by any marked increase or decrease of sickness, the deaths in the aggregate from all diseases being much the same as in 1888.

It will be noticed that for the Town of Calcutta the death-rate was 26.9, and for the Suburbs 46.9, as against 26.97 and 42.49, respectively, in the previous year; but the most notable feature in the table is a consi- derable diminution of deaths from cholera and an active recrudescence of small- pox which occurred at the end of the year after it had been comparatively dormant for three previous years.
2 REPORT ON THE 4. Fevers, bowel-complaints and those diseases classed under the comprehensive heading of " other causes" gave rise to increased mortality in the Town of Calcutta, while, as regards the Suburbs, there was an apparent diminution under all these headings; but the figures for this locality cannot be relied upon, because certain changes in the boundaries of the municipal area which have been made during the past year have had the effect of rendering impossible a comparison with previous years. 5. The death-rate for Howrah was 22.71 as compared with 21.68 in 1888. Like Calcutta, it shows a diminution of deaths from cholera, while there has been a slight increase under most of the other headings. 6. Numbers treated in Hospital.CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 3 11. With regard to the closing of the Mayo Institutions on Sundays, I do not think a change of this kind should be introduced without the sanction of Government, because it is obvious that if each institution in Calcutta is worked on a system of its own in regard to the hours and days of attendance, much con- fusion will occur in the annual statistics, and all useful comparison will be impossible. Similarly at Howrah the Superintendent of the hospital there (Dr. Matthew) thought proper to refuse medicine and attendance to well-to- do out-patients; and although some such restriction on the attendance of people of this class is much to be desired, the change should not be introduced without the sanction of Government, and if made at all it should be applicable to the other charitable medical institutions in Calcutta. 12. The indoor attendance has increased at nearly all the charitable institu- tions except at those of the Mayo group, while at the Campbell Hospital, which is mostly resorted to by pauper and famine-stricken patients, the increase has been very considerable, necessitating the provision of a temporary shed in order to prevent overcrowding. It is probable that a large portion of the increase in the indoor patients generally at the hospitals was due to the high price of food grains in Calcutta and the surrounding districts during a great part of the year. The death-rate among the patients treated was 126.13 per mille, against 124.05 in 1888. STATEMENT No. II. Race and Sex of outdoor and indoor patients. Total for 1888. Male. Female. Children.

This table indicates a very considerable falling off in the number of nearly all classes of patients, and perhaps the increase of over 5,000 sick who attended in 1889 at the Dufferin Hospital, which is under the able management of Mrs. Foggo, accounts in a great measure for the smaller number of women and children who have received medical aid at the other charitable institutions of the town; but the decrease in the number of male patients, amounting to nearly 20,000, is mainly attributable to the inaccuracy of the returns in 1888, as already explained. The decrease has not been confined to the members of any particular race, but is apparent among all classes except Europeans, who have resorted to the hospitals in somewhat larger numbers than in 1888.

From this table it will be seen that the number of cholera cases treated in the hospitals was smaller than in the previous year, and the mortality among them was less. The death-rate among all the patients, excluding cholera, was 112 per mille, against 104 in 1888.

PARTICULAR DISEASES.9 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. Europeans who have recently arrived in the country, a class of people parti- cularly prone to attacks of this disease. Eleven cases were treated in the General and three in the Howrah Hospitals, but none in any of the other Institutions. Neither is it common among the European troops quartered in Fort William, only one case having occurred in 1889 in an average annual strength of 1,118. It will be observed from the table that while enteric fever has not increased to any appreciable extent in the last three years, there has been a consider- able decrease in the number of cases of remittent fever in that period. 27.

The total number of major operations performed during the year at all the Institutions collectively was 1,926, against 1,719 in the previous year, while the minor operations rose from 20,264 in 1888 to 20,933 in 1889. The number of cataract cases operated on was 329 as compared with 325 in 1888. I particularise this operation because it usually contributes, more than any other, to swell the total of the year, and the fact that there were only four more than in 1888 shows that increase has chiefly occurred among general operations. Eighty deaths occurred after operation, making the death-rate 39 per mille when the number of cases remaining from the previous year are taken into account. The corresponding figure for 1888 was 46 per mille. These rates compare very favourably with what obtained in former years, and bear testimony to the skill of the operators and to the careful after-treatment received by the patients. Strict antiseptic precautions which are now generally adopt- ed, careful nursing, and good sanitary arrangements, have also contributed to the success which has been obtained. 30. At the Medical College Hospital there were 1,414 major operations during the year, and 74 remained under treatment from the previous year, making a total of 1,488, of which only 47 proved fatal. Many of these oper- ations were of an important character, requiring much skill for their proper performance and treatment. Among them there were the following:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 15 36. At the Presidency General Hospital, which is chiefly intended for medical cases, there were 47 operations as compared with 40 in 1888. None of them were of a very important character. 37. The Campbell Hospital furnishes a list of 159 operations, against 157 in 1888. Most of these were performed by Assistant Surgeon Zuhuruddin, the Teacher of Surgery. Assistant Surgeon Gonesh Chunder Mitter, L.M.S., performed 24 major operations; Assistant Surgeon Upendra Narain Roy, M.B., 12; Assistant Surgeon Lolit Mohun Laha, M.B., 11; Assistant Surgeon Sirish Chun- der Sircar, M.B., 8; Assistant Surgeon Gopal Lall Haldar, M.B., 1; and Assist- ant Surgeon Durlav Chunder Dutt, M.B., 1. The number of cataract cases increased from 22 to 31, which is very satisfactory. 38. There were 230 major operations at the Mayo Institutions during the year, and 12 deaths. The death-rate was 48.97 per mille, against 50. in 1888. Most of these were performed at the Mayo Hospital, where there were 177 major operations, against 233 in the previous year16 REPORT ON THE Natives. Remaining on 1st January 1889. Admitted. Total.

The total number of deaths among 1,603 treated was 85, or a death- rate of 53.02 per mille, as against 46.13 per mille in 1888. 44. There were 497 confinements, or a decrease of 16, caused by the want of accommodation already alluded to. The total number of deaths following confinement was 18, or 36.2 per 1,000, compared with 20 deaths, or 38.9 per 1,000, in 1888, and 25, or 56 per 1,000, in 1887. 45. Analysing these deaths, we find there were 4 in 211 labours among Europeans, or at the rate of 18.9 per 1,000, while among natives there were 14 deaths after or during labour in 286 cases, or at the rate of 48.9 per 1,000. 46. The marked difference in the mortality of the two races was due to the bad condition in which many of the native women were sent to hospital, and it may be remarked that out of the 14 deaths no less than 7 occurred in women who had been in labour for hours, or even days, before admission, or were moribund on arrival at the hospital. 47. The four deaths among the Europeans after labour were due to hyper- pyrexia and embolism, and none occurred from septicæmia. There were nine cases of the last disease which supervened after labour. Two of these (one European and one Native) developed the disease in hospital, and both recovered, while seven natives who were admitted after having contracted it outside, died. 48. The fact that so little septicæmia was developed in hospital says much for the care which has been taken by Dr. Joubert and his Resident Surgeon Dr. Adie to enforce the observance of antiseptic precautions in all cases of labour, and which is deserving of commendation. With a view of more thoroughly impressing on the nurses of the institution the importance of observing antiseptic precautions in all their dealings with parturient women, Dr. Adie has recently published in pamphlet form a very useful and instructive lecture which he delivered on that subject, and it is to be hoped that no pains will be spared to render the development of so dangerous and fatal a disease as septicæmia is, an event of very rare occurrence.
CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 17 The two cases which occurred during the past year, although a great con- trast with the prevalence of the disease in former years, prove how danger- ous it would be to relax any efforts in this direction. It may be mentioned in this connection that the steam-laundry, for the erection of which Govern- ment sanction was obtained two years ago, is not yet ready for use, as some delay has occurred in fitting it with the necessary machinery. 49. The surgical work at this hospital has increased considerably, although the return for 1889 of major operations has been much diminished by the exclusion of a number of operations which were included in the major list last year. There were 199 major operations performed during the year, which are included in the list of the Medical College Hospital to be found in Statement VII. I do not suppose it is the wish of Government that I should enter into details concerning these operations, which are more or less of a technical character, but some of the more important may be enumerated. These comprised five cases of abdominal section, one of kolpohysterectomy, three of oophorectomy, and six of ovariotomy. The latter had all a successful termination, upon which Dr. Joubert is to be congratulated. 50. With reference to the altered classification of obstetric and gyneco- logical operations which Dr. Joubert has adopted this year, it may be remarked that an unauthorised change of this kind is much to be deprecated, because it has a tendency to produce confusion in the returns and to prevent a proper comparison of the surgical work of one hospital with that of another; but it is to some extent unavoidable, because the classification, as sanctioned by the Government of India in Resolution No. 129, dated 21st February 1877, is quite out of date, and it is often difficult to decide whether an operation should be placed in the major or minor category. Indeed, the classification followed varies considerably in different hospitals, and as it is very desirable that one uniform system should be adopted for the whole of India, I would suggest that the present list should be revised. 51.

Atkinson, the Honorary Secretary of the Committee of the Canning Home, has also been of great service to attending to many details which the management of so useful an institution necessarily involves. 56. I am glad to be able to report that four permanent nurses have now been appointed to the Eden Hospital, where that number can be kept fully occupied, and where it is dangerous to rely too exclusively on the services of temporary nurses, many of whom are only learning their duties. 57. Twelve European and Eurasian nurses passed out during the year, two passing their examination with "great credit" and nine "with credit." Seven dais were also examined and passed. STATEMENT No. VIII.

The total income of all the institutions was Rs. 5,21,390-3.7, derived from the following sources:20 REPORT ON THE in the cost of Europe medicines was Rs. 1,182-7, which is mainly accounted for by many new and costly instruments having been obtained for the Eden Hospital and the Eye Infirmary, and by the larger expenditure of water proof sheeting. The expenditure on diet shows an increase of Rs. 396-5-1, which is attributed to the higher contract rates Miscellaneous charges rose from Rs. 22,125-14-1 in 1888 to Rs. 30,683-0-5 in 1889, the increase being mainly due to the renewal of the unserviceable bedding and clothing of the Medical College and Eden Hospitals, and to the payment of the bills for rates and taxes for the last quarter of 1888. Buildings and repairs show a decrease of Rs. 13,485. Nothing was invested in 1889. The total expenditure in 1888, exclusive of the building charges and the amount invested,was Rs. 1,11,848.0.7, but in 1889 it was Rs. 1,24,044-5. 65. Choonee Lal Seal21 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. Rs. 73,800-14-11. The cause of this increase was due to a large amount having been expended by the Public Works Department on the introduction of the unfiltered water-supply to the hospital and school buildings, the relaying of the drainage of the compound of the institution, and the erection of two new latrines, a sanitas or flushing depôt, and a steam-engine to supply unfiltered water from the Canning Square tank. The erection of a new hospital for European small-pox paying patients and of a shed to relieve overcrowding in the general wards also gave rise to considerable expenditure. The total income from local sources increased by Rs. 3,912-8-5. The increase was chiefly due to hospital charges for the medical treatment of patients. There was an increase under all heads of expenditure, except Europe medicines and establishment. The reason for the decrease in the cost of establishment is that the pay of the Superintendent, as well as that of the officer who officiated for him for three months in 1888 during his absence on leave, was debited to the hospital. Diet charges show an increase of Rs. 5,165-10-10, and bazar medicines Rs. 34-0-2. The increase is explained to have been caused by a larger daily average number of sick in the hospital in 1889. To this cause partly is ascribed the increase of Rs. 2,739-12 under miscellaneous items, which was also brought about by the purchase of 16 new iron cots with wire matrasses, &c., for the European paying small-pox ward. There was a diminution of Rs. 279-9-8 in the expenditure under Europe medicines, which is said to have been probably due to the type of the diseases of patients admitted having been of a milder character requiring less medicines. Building and repairs show an increase of Rs. 69,165-11-3, particulars of which have been noticed above. Rs. 1,023-7-11 were expended on investment during the year, one Baboo N. C. Chatterjee having given Rs. 1,000 in July 1888. The interest of this amount is to be expended in helping pauper patients to return to their homes. The total expenditure of the hospital was Rs. 1,39,144-15-11, against Rs. 61,454-2-4 in 1888; but deducting the building charges from the figures of 1888 and 1889, and also the amount invested in the latter year, the total expenditure stands at Rs. 62,274-2-6, against Rs. 54,772-8-1 in 1888. 70. Police Hospital.22 REPORT ON THE items shows a decrease of Rs. 2,902-5, which is explained to have been caused by a larger expenditure on fittings and furniture in 1888 which has not been necessary in 1889. The large increase of Rs. 11,640-12-9 under the head of building and repairs was due to the construction of a new ward for 20 moribund cases in the Native department. The total expenditure of the hospital amounted to Rs. 37,154-7-1, against Rs. 26,967-0-3 in 1888, but excluding expenditure on building in both years and the amount invested in 1888, the figures stand respectively at Rs. 25,043-4-1 and Rs. 26,496-10. There was at the end of the year a cash balance of Rs. 2,222-3-8. 72. Subjoined are extracts from the reports of the Superintendents of the several institutions, with some remarks thereon. 73.

Clarke throughout the year, except for the period he acted as First Resident Surgeon, during which time Surgeon Crawford held the office of Second Resident Surgeon. 80. The total number of patients treated during the year was 3,190, against 2,968 in 1888. Besides these there were in 1889 173 patients, who were classed under 24 REPORT ON THE 89. Campbell Hospital.25 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 20 deaths in 1889, against 30 in the previous year, the death-rates being 8.2 per mille and 10.9 per mille respectively. The diminution in the death-rate is said to have been due to the constables not having suffered so much from cholera in the year under review as compared with 1888, and also to mortality from this disease having been less in the year. There were 9 cases of cholera, with 3 deaths, in 1889, as against 24 and 14, respectively, in the previous year. There were 2 cases of small-pox, against 3 in 1888. The number of patients who suffered from venereal diseases was 113, against 122 in the previous year. 96. Dr. Mackenzie reports that a new dead-house was constructed in a suitable part of the compound. The old cots were repaired and painted, and 20 new ones were added to the number. Some petty repairs were also executed to the hospital buildings. There is no regular outdoor department in this hospital, but 12 constables (8 European and 4 Natives), who suffered from trivial com- plaints, received medicines from the hospital. Besides these, 42 members of the Burmah Military Police force were sent in the hospital for treatment. The Superintendent remarks that these sepoys were in a low and anæmic condition, and some of them were in a moribund state. Of the 42, 13 patients died, or a rate of 30.95 per cent. 97.

These orders are moreover applicable to other hospitals in Calcutta and its suburbs. 3. Only 31,338 women and 51,439 children were treated in the various institutions to which the report refers in 1889 as compared with 36,030 women and 59,404 children in 1888. This falling off is undoubtedly due in no small measure to the very successful management of the Lady Dufferin Hospital by Mrs. Foggo. The death-rate in all Hospitals, excluding the Eye Infirmary, rose from 124 to 126, the rates for the Campbell and Howrah Hospitals, where paupers are treated, and into which many moribund and incurable cases are admitted, being, as usual, very high. Though the general death-rate is slightly higher than in the preceding year, which again showed a slight increase on the years 1887 and 1888, it was still much below the average of the years 1879( 3 ) 8. In the Eden Hospital 2,435 women and children were treated against 2,668 in the previous year, showing a decrease of 233 cases. Owing to want of accommodation when the building was under repairs, many applicants had to be refused admission. Of the 2,435 patients treated, 832 were Europeans and 1,603 natives. The deaths among the former amounted to 29, and among the latter to 56. The number of confinement cases fell from 513 in 1888 to 497; the mortality among this class of patients being 18 against 20 in 1888. The very few cases of septicæmia which occurred in the Hospital show that antiseptic precautions were carefully enforced in all cases of labour. The import- ance of these precautions has been fully impressed on the nurses, and it is hoped that no pains will be spared to eliminate this dangerous and fatal disease. The steam laundry sanctioned for this institution is not yet ready for use, owing to some delay in fitting it with the requisite machinery. Certain alterations made by Dr. Joubert in the classification of obstetric and gynæcological operations, are likely to produce some confusion in the annual returns, but appear, at the same time, to be unavoidable, as, in the absence of any recent orders on the subject, difficulty is often experienced in the classification of these operations. With a view to ensure one uniform system in the different hospitals, the Inspector-General suggests that the classification sanctioned in the Resolution of the Government of India, No. 129, dated the 21st February 1877, should be revised. The Lieutenant-Governor agrees in these remarks, and will consult the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals with a view to formulating the alterations which may be recommended to the Government of India. 9. In the Ezra Hospital 1,438 out-patients and 236 in-patients, most of whom were Jews, were treated during the year. Of the in-door patients 153 were cured, 43 relieved, 26 otherwise discharged, and 3 died. These figures show that the benefits conferred by this institution are fully appreciated by the Jewish community. 10. The Lieutenant-Governor is glad to find that the nurses employed in the hospitals continue to discharge their duties thoroughly and well, and has read with great pleasure the high praise accorded by Dr. Hilson to the ladies of the Clewer Sisterhood in speaking of the indefatigable services rendered by them in supervision and in tending the sick. Four permanent nurses were appointed this year to the Eden Hospital, as it was considered dangerous to rely exclusively on temporary nurses, many of whom do not possess sufficient experience in the work. Twelve European and Eurasian nurses passed their examination, two of them with great credit. 11. The invested capital of the Calcutta institutions shows a decrease of Rs. 8,500; securities to the value of Rs. 12,000 were withdrawn, and applied to the construction of a new moribund ward in the native department of the Howrah Hospital. The total income during the year, including the opening balance, amounted to Rs. 5,21,390; of this sum Rs. 3,46,858 were contributed by Government. The total expenditure, excluding the amount invested, was Rs. 5,01,970, against Rs. 4,27,082 in 1888. The increase was mainly due to a large expenditure on buildings and repairs in the Campbell Hospital, while the increase in the amount contributed by Government is due to the entire cost of the Police Hospital having been met from Provincial Funds. The Inspector- General remarks that the Calcutta Municipality contributed nothing towards the Mayo institutions, and that it is time to consider whether, in view of the fact that Government has undertaken all charges on account of Calcutta Police, the Municipality should not relieve the Government of its contribution towards the medical charities of the city. It has already been pointed out to Dr. Hilson that the entire relief afforded to the Municipality by the reduction of police estimates is hypothecated to the improvements of the Suburbs, and that, so far as this argument is concerned, it affords no ground for asking the Municipality to undertake all charges on account of the medical relief of the town. 12. The thanks of Government are due to Dr. Hilson for his careful and interesting report.

SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit the annual report on the Medical Institutions of Calcutta for 1890. 2. The health of the Town of Calcutta for the past year has on the whole been somewhat worse than in the preceding years, as far as can be judged from the returns of mortality given below. The figures for the Town of Calcutta and Howrah are available for the last ten years, but those of the amalgamated area of the Suburbs of Calcutta are given only for 1889 and 1890, as the changes recently made in the boundaries of this area preclude the possibility of drawing any useful inferences from a more extended comparison with previous years.

2 REPORT ON THE 3. While there was generally a marked diminution in the deaths from cholera and bowel-complaints, and in those diseases coming under the heading of "Other causes," there has been a very appreciable increase in the mortality occasioned by small-pox and fevers. The active recrudescence of small-pox, which was noticed in my last report as having occurred at the end of 1889, reached its culminating point in the beginning of 1890, and gradually died away as the rains set in. During the year fevers were more than usually prevalent in Calcutta, and to some extent also at Howrah, while in the amalgamated area of the Suburbs of Calcutta there was a small decrease of these affections. The total death-rate for Calcutta in 1890 was 28.5 per mille, which exceeds that of the past four years. At Howrah it was 20.62, which is a decrease as compared with the last two years, but still larger than what it was in 1887. In the amal- gamated area of the Suburbs of Calcutta the rate was 47.5, against 46.9 in 1889. STATEMENT NO. I. 1890. 1889. TOTAL TREATED. Died per mille of treated. TOTAL TREATED.

PARTICULAR DISEASES.CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 9 Department I noticed that when cholera appears among troops in cantonments it usually finds most of its victims among those men, women, and children who are not living under the strict military discipline or under the same sanitary rules to which the private soldier is subject, and the conservancy arrangements of the quarters of these people are often found to be very defective in spite of daily or weekly inspections by officers appointed for the purpose. It is also a very singular circumstance that while 11 cases of cholera occurred among patients in the Campbell Hospital in 1888 and 18 cases in 1889, there was not a single case in 1890. It would be very unwise to draw any general or special inference in such a matter from the experience of one year, but it is certainly very remarkable that coincident with this immunity of the patients from cholera attacks there was a new latrine system at work at this hospital for the whole year, and therefore I am hopeful that when the present system of conservancy at the General Hospital undergoes still further improve- ment, the occurrence of cholera among patients under treatment for other diseases will become a thing of the past. 16. Dysentery was somewhat less prevalent in 1890 than in the previous year, the largest number of cases having been treated in the Campbell Hospital, where 622 were admitted with 244 deaths, showing how fatal this disease is among the poorest classes of the community. 17. Diarrh10 REPORT ON THE persons affected with this disease in Calcutta, and it is impossible at present to say with any approach to accuracy how far it is prevalent among the community; but probably some information on this point will be furnished by the returns of the recently taken census, when they are available. In my triennial report of the Bengal dispensaries, published in 1890, I gave my views on the nature of this disease as regards its contagiousness and the extent to which a system of segregation of lepers should be carried, and I will only remark here that I have seen no reason to modify these views, which I have little doubt will in the main be endorsed by the Special Leprosy Commission now sitting at Simla. 23. As regards the other diseases enumerated in the returns, nothing need be said, as the figures present only the usual variations that occur from year to year. STATEMENT No. VI. ENTERIC FEVER.

CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 15 No. VIII16 REPORT ON THE 29. It will be seen that the total number of an important character has slightly increased, being 2,080 in 1890, as against 1,926 in the previous year. The minor operations have fallen off during the year from 20,933 to 19,956, the decrease being principally at the Medical College Hospital, and is probably due to the changes which take place from time to time in the Resident and House Surgeons of that institution, some of whom take a greater interest in surgery than others. 30. Among the major operations there were 88 deaths, or at the rate of 39 per mille, which is the same as it was in 1889. In 1880 the mortality, after operations at the Calcutta hospitals, was 91 per mille, and in 1881 it was 86 per mille, so that the present death-rate of 39 may be looked upon as a great improvement, and indicates the advance which has been made in surgical practice in recent years. 31. Looking at particular institutions, we find that at the Medical College Hospital there was a slight increase in the number of major operations, the numbers being 1,447 in 1890 and 1,414 in 1889. Most of these occurred in the wards of the 1st and 2nd Surgeons and the Opthalmic Surgeon, and many of them were of a very important character, as may be seen from the following list of some of them:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 17 have been expected, considering the very large staff of medical officers who are attached to it. The death-rate was 84 per mille in 1890, against 44 in 1889, and a very large proportion of the cataract, lithotomy and other cases were unsuccessful. It is true that many of the patients who frequent this hospital are admitted in a weak and anæmic condition and are often starving, and such individuals are doubtless not good subjects for operation; but there must be a considerable number who are in fairly good health, and if the cases for operation are properly selected, there ought not to be so large a mortality. In connection with this subject Dr. Cobb, the Superintendent, urges that an out-door department, which was proposed two years ago, should be added to the hospital, and I am happy to state that its construction, which was postponed for want of funds, is now about to be proceeded with. Not only will this department, when completed, be most useful to the general population living in the neighbourhood, but Dr. Cobb expects it will afford better opportunities of teaching practical surgery to the students of the school attached to the hospital. 34. At the Mayo Institutions there were 253 operations, against 230 in the previous year. The death-rate was 49.24 per mille, against 48.97 in 1889. At the Mayo Hospital itself there were 189 operations, which are much the same as in previous years. The following are some of the more important:18 REPORT ON THE Rs. 300 for the purchase of surgical instruments while on furlough in England during the year, and these, which are of the most recent and approved patterns, are approved by the Principal of the Medical College. During Mr. Wood's absence for six months in England, Mr. G. O. Ranger officiated for him. Mr. Wood complains of the dark and dingy quarters which are allotted to him for dental practice in the Choonee Lall Seal's Dispensary, but I do not see how anything can be done at present to provide him with more suitable rooms. 37.

The reason of this is probably that the former have a greater appreciation of the benefits to be derived from the institution, while it may be supposed that the Dufferin Hospital, under the energetic management of Mrs. Foggo, M.D., attracts a number of native patients who would otherwise go to the Eden. 39. The figures also afford evidence of a very satisfactory diminution of the death-rate both among Europeans and Natives. This can be accounted for by the improved methods of treatment now adopted and to strict attention to antiseptic precautions in all surgical and midwifery cases. The mortality among the native patients, although considerably less than it was in former years, is still lamentably high, contrasting very unfavourably with that of the Europeans, and is caused in a great measure by the reluctance of the former to resort to the hospital at an early stage of sickness. The total number of deaths among both Europeans and Natives was 69 out of 1,772 treated, against 85 out of 1,603 in 1889, or at the rate of 38.93 per mille in 1890, against 53.02 in 1889. 40. There were 442 confinements, against 497 in the previous year20 REPORT ON THE 44. Some of the operations at the Eden Hospital may be enumerated:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 21 women, who are more or less untrained, and as this arrangement has not been found altogether satisfactory, steps are being taken to effect an improvement by increasing the number of nurses and distributing their duties so as to secure greater attention to the sick. Better supervision of the nurses is also required. 50. Twelve pupil nurses and eight pupil dais were under training at the Eden Hospital during the year, and of the former nine passed their final examination, and four of them with credit. Of the dais, four passed22 REPORT ON THE 52. The total income of all the institutions was Rs. 4,69,810-8-10, and the sources from which it was derived are detailed below:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 23 for linseed meal. There was a saving, however, under the head of Europe medicines. The expenditure on diet was greater by Rs. 3,813-240 in 1890 than in 1889, which is accounted for by the larger number of diets issued and by the higher contract rate for milk. The amount expended on miscellaneous items shows a reduction of Rs. 1,978-3-11, which is very satisfactory. The outlay on buildings and repairs increased by Rs. 32,323, owing chiefly to the construction of new latrines at the east end of the hospital, and of the steam laundry. Nothing was invested in 1890. The total expenditure, exclusive of the building charges, was Rs. 1,26,436-8, against Rs. 1,24,044-5 in 1889. 55.

Police Hospital.25 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. out-door patients were treated in excess of the number in 1889, and this accession in the number of patients is attributed to the unhealthiness of the year and to the increased popularity of the institution. 65. Several improvements have been effected during the year in the hospital under the energetic management of the Principal Surgeon-Major E. A. Birch. The one of most importance is the remodelling of the latrines at the east end of the hospital. The Principal, gives the following account of the steam laundry:26 REPORT ON THE in 1889." The total number of out-door patients increased by 303, the figure being 40,176, against 39,873 in 1889. The daily average number was 330.77, against 323.42 in the previous year. 72.

These rates, though they do not materially differ from those of former years, are lamentably high, and are ascribed to the fact that these hospitals receive a large number of destitute and moribund patients from all parts of Calcutta and Howrah. The report also shows a sadly high death-rate among the children treated at the hospitals, and specially among female children. Dr. Hilson observes that the high death-rate among female children may be attributed partly to the fact that fewer girls as compared with boys are taken to the hospital for treatment; but this view seems hardly to be borne out by the total figures of admissions, deaths, and rate of mortality shown in the following statement:( 3 ) It is also satisfactory to notice that the training of nurses and dais at the Eden Hospital appears to be thoroughly successful. 9. The invested capital of the hospitals, Rs. 5,77,000, remained unchanged during the year. The following statement compares the main heads of income and expenditure for all the institutions dealt with in the report during the last two years:( 4 ) the hospitals of the metropolis. The total income of the mofussil dispensaries amounted in 1889 to Rs. 4,73,332, and the expenditure to Rs. 4,37,095, sums which correspond approximately to the income and expenditure of the Calcutta Medical Institutions during the past year. But the income derived from private subscriptions came to Rs. 1,36,738, against Rs. 12,171 subscribed in Calcutta, and that from municipal allotments to Rs. 1,61,843 against Rs. 34,347 in Calcutta, making a total of Rs. 2,98,581 compared with Rs. 46,518 collected under these heads in Calcutta. 10. The total expenditure of the year fell from Rs. 5,01,971 (the actuals of 1889 excluding a small sum invested) to Rs. 4,53,522, nearly the whole decrease being due to diminished expenditure under the head of buildings and repairs. The cost of bazar medicines, Europe medicines, and diet shows no material variations. There was a rise of Rs. 5,968 in the charges for establish- ment, and a decrease of Rs. 9,952 under the head of miscellaneous charges. 11. In conclusion, the Lieutenant-Governor would observe that this report, which treats of the most important medical institutions in the country, actually conveys less information regarding their working than is regularly given for every charitable dispensary in Bengal. The statistical tables which are annexed to the Report on Charitable Dispensaries contain more facts, and present them in a more intelligible form, than the comparatively meagre state- ments which are inserted in the text of the Report on the Calcutta Hospitals. It is, for example, impossible to ascertain from the latter report the average cost of a diet in each of the Calcutta hospitals, although this point is one which has a most important bearing on hospital management, and requires constant watching; and in the case of the Calcutta hospitals formed the subject of an elaborate enquiry about twelve years ago. Statement I, showing the number treated in the Calcutta hospitals, is less useful than the corresponding state- ment (II) for the dispensaries, in so far as it does not show the number of beds available, the daily average of in-door and out-door patients, and the propor- tion of men, women, and children treated as in-door patients. Again state- ment No. II, giving the race and sex of all patients, does not distinguish the institutions they resorted to, nor does it show the average daily attendance for each class, or the proportions of men, women, and children making up the total. In all these points it is inferior to table No. IV, annexed to the Dispensaries Report. With reference to these remarks the Inspector-General should, in his report for next year, revise the statements given in the report under review, and should endeavour to expand them so as to convey fuller information, and to bring them as far as possible into correspondence with those given in the Report on Charitable Dispensaries.

2 REPORT ON THE The figures for the Town and amalgamated area of the Suburbs of Calcutta show that the year was very unhealthy. The death-rates, however, having been calculated on the census figures of 1891 cannot be justly com- pared with those of the year 1890, which were based on the census figures of 1881; but there has generally been a marked increase in the mortality from the prevalent diseases except small-pox. Cholera was more than usually prevalent in the early part of the year under report, and this is attributed to the Ardhodoy Jog festival, which took place in February. Small-pox showed a marked diminution in the year under review, and the immunity which Calcutta enjoyed in this respect is reflected in our hospital statistics. 3. As desired by His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor, I have adopted the returns used in the charitable dispensary report for the Calcutta institutions. These are all given in the appendix. 4.

8 REPORT ON THE 11. PARTICULAR DISEASES.9 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. charnel house, can appreciate the improvements which have been carried out under the solicitude of its various Superintendents under whom it has been placed, and yet down to 1890 cases of cholera used to occur in the wards. Dr. Birch, one of the previous Superintendents, looking to the dangers of a bazar milk and butter supply, recommended the institution of a large dairy and the use of Danish butter. This was done, but still cases continued. A sanitas, which is said to act satisfactorily, was erected for the disposal of all night- soil. Still there were cases in the wards, and the last thing that has been done is to substitute open drains for all covered drains within the com- pound walls. In 1891 there was not a single case of cholera, and Dr. Crombie attributes the exemption to these open drains, which can now be kept clean and which are incapable of conveying sewer gases to the wards in conjunction with the sanitary measures introduced by his predecessors. How far this additional precaution will prevent future outbreaks remains to be seen, but I do not think that the sanitary defects of the hospital have yet been entirely obviated. The Calcutta water-supply is used for drinking and cooking purposes, but I notice that tank water is still used for washing. In spite, too, of great efforts to keep the privies clean, I confess I should like to see them remodelled on the plan adopted by Dr. Birch at the Medical College. Until these two defects are remedied, this hospital cannot be said to be in a perfectly sanitary condition. 16. In a similar manner cholera used to appear among the patients under treatment in the Campbell Hospital. By the introduction of a pure water-supply and other sanitary arrangements a great improvement was effected until 1890, when I was able to report that not a single case had arisen in the hospital during that year. In 1891, however, seven fresh cases occurred among the patients, due, as Dr. Cobb thinks, to the use of bad milk, but, as I have pointed out above, the defective state of the latrines may have also been an important factor in determining the outbreak. 17. With regard to the Mayo Native Hospital, I am told that cases of cholera used to occur in hospital some years ago, but there are none now, their disappearance being coincident with the improvement of the drinking-water, and more particularly with the improved system of latrines adopted some years ago by Dr. Sanders. 18. In every outbreak of cholera, whether in a hospital or elsewhere, there are always three factors, and the presence of all three is necessary for the outbreak. The first is the introduction of the poison or germ, the second is a suitable soil for the growth and development of the poison or germ, and the third is some condition, meteorological or seasonal, which is essential for the growth of the germ in the soil. Living in the endemic area, the prevention of the first, i.e., the introduction of the germ, is difficult, but probably not impossible, and hence the necessity for care for the purity of the water, milk, and food supplies. The third we cannot control, but with the second we are able to deal in the manner pointed out in the Sanitary reports of the Army Sanitary Commission, especially for 1889, which has been published in 1891, and it is the duty of each Superintendent to gradually work his hospital up to the necessary degree of sanitary perfection as each defect becomes patent. The practical immunity of the European residents of Calcutta of late years from cholera is an instance of how much can be done, even by such imperfect measures of sanitation as those which the Calcutta Municipality offers to persons who are in a position to avail themselves of them. 19. As with cholera so with small-pox, which is the most infectious of the exanthematous fevers, we know that in India its prevalence is practically confined to two months of the year, and that it recurs with increased virulence every fourth or fifth year in England as well as in India Our knowledge, however, of the laws which determine this recrudescence is still rudimentary, but we happily possess a prophylactic for this disease in vaccination, which, if it were only fully accepted by the people and efficiently carried out, would make a knowledge of these laws, however interesting, almost superfluous. 20.

The 21 cases were all natives. The diminution in the number treated in 1891 was due to there having been no epidemic of this disease. There were five deaths from small-pox against 153 in 1890. The total number of deaths at this hospital was 1,711, or a rate of 18.82 per cent., against 1,708 and 20.29, respectively, in 1890. The decrease in the death-rate is said to have been largely due to a smaller number of deaths from small-pox, measles, other diseases of the respi- ratory system, and leprosy. Excluding the deaths from cholera, the death-rate stands at 17.2 per cent. in 1891 against 19.3 per cent. in the previous year. Besides the total number of patients treated in the hospital, there were 39 cases of no appreciable diseases against 42 in 1890. 77.

36 APPENDIX. STATEMENT V, PART IMUNICIPAL DEPARTMENT. MEDICAL. No. 157T.-M. DARJEELING, THE 28TH MAY 1892. RESOLUTION. READ( 2 ) increased from 1553.14 to 1671.98, and that of indoor patients from 1202.93 to 1205.67. During the year an outdoor department was opened at the Eden Hospital, and though the attendance was not as large as might have been expected, there is every reason to believe that it will improve as the dispensary comes to be more generally known. Of the total number of patients, both indoor and outdoor, treated in all the hospitals during the year, 153,705 were men, 34,678 women, and 56,753 children. The corresponding figures for the previous year were 143,722, 33,017 and 55,696. More than 50 per cent. of the patients treated were Hindus, next in order coming Muhammadans, Eurasians, Europeans, and other classes. Fewer Europeans sought relief at the hospitals during 1891 than in the previous year. 3. The death-rate among all the patients under treatment during 1891 was 127 per mille against 124 in 1890, excluding the patients treated for eye-diseases. This includes deaths from cholera, without which the death-rate would be 113 against 114 per mille. The average death-rate in English hospi- tals is stated to be 80 per thousand, and in French hospitals 95. In 1882 the death-rate in St. Bartholomew's Hospital in London was as high as 120, the Edinburgh rate being 105. As in the previous year, the death-rates were highest in the Howrah and Campbell Hospitals, which is natural, seeing that these are the refuges to which emigrants taken ill in the depôts, moribund cases found in the streets, and pauper patients generally are sent. Last year's Report and Resolution drew attention to the fact that the death-rate in our hospitals was persistently higher among girls than boys. This year this inequality has been removed, as the following statement shows:( 3 ) cholera" as an illustration of what may be effected by improved sanitary surroundings. This, if it be a fact of permanent duration, is an important piece of evidence, but though the statement may be broadly true, it is certainly subject to a considerable number of exceptions. Dysentery and diarrh( 4 ) hospital are said to be still very defective, although attention was drawn to them in the report for 1890. The Lieutenant-Governor trusts that the Principal will take steps to remedy this state of things, which is likely to impair the reputation and popularity of the hospital. 7. During the year the Shama Churn Law Eye Infirmary was opened, and all cases which were formerly treated in the ophthalmic wards of the Medical College Hospital were transferred to it. As a separate institution, the Eye Infirmary appears to have attracted more patients, the number of those seeking outdoor relief having increased from 10,466 to 11,389. The number of indoor patients was 504 against 563 in 1890. Most of the operations performed during the year consisted of cataract extraction, the percentage of success being 66.79, against 68.81 in 1890. 8. The number of Jewish patients, both indoor and outdoor, treated at the Ezra Hospital increased during the year. The outdoor patients numbered 2,279 with a daily average of 12.63, against 1,633 with a daily average of 9.3 in 1890. The indoor patients numbered 342 with a daily average of 16.73, against 248 with a daily average of 11.33. 9. The nursing arrangements at all the hospitals, especially at the Presidency General, Medical College, and Eden Hospitals, are reported to have been satisfactory. Thirteen pupil-nurses and eight pupil-dhais passed out of the Eden Hospital during the year, which speaks well for the training received by them at this institution. 10. The invested capital of the hospitals increased from Rs. 5,77,000 to Rs. 5,83,000. More than half of this belongs to the Mayo Institutions, and the increase during the year was due to the munificent gift of Rs. 10,000 made by Maharaja Bahadur Sir Jotendro Mohun Tagore to the Mayo Native Hospital. Securities to the value of Rs. 4,000 were sold during the year out of the capital of the Howrah General Hospital to meet the cost of quadrennial repairs. The following statement compares the main heads of income and expenditure of the hospitals for the past two years:( 5 ) increase occurred under all heads of income, except Europe medicines, but was mainly due to the donation of Rs. 10,000 above mentioned given to the Mayo Hospital. The Lieutenant-Governor is glad to notice the improvement in the amount of subscriptions realized from Europeans as well as Natives. The contributions from Local Funds increased by Rs. 2,000, but little or no advance was made in the amount contributed from Municipal Funds. The total expenditure of the year exceeded that of the previous year by Rs. 15,920, the excess being chiefly on account of diet and miscellaneous charges. In the Medical College Hospital alone there was an increase of Rs. 4,442 in the expenditure on diet, and in the Presidency General Hospital the miscellaneous charges exceeded those of the previous year by Rs. 11,847. This, it is explained, was due to the payment of rates and taxes for the year 1891 and the previous year, the payment of the value of clothing purchased in 1890, and repairs and improvements to the hospital. In Statement V, Part I, appended to the report, the average cost of each diet during the year is shown to have been as follows:( 6 ) No. 158T.
