JOSLEN, F.R.C.V.S., I.C.V.D., Acting Principal, Bombay Veterinary College; To THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION, Poona. SIR, I have the honour to submit this the twenty-first Annual Report of the Bombay Veterinary College dealing with its administration during the official year 1906-1907. Mr. M. H. Sowerby, I C.V.D., was in charge of the College up to 3rd June 1906, when I took over charge on my return from study leave. A brief outline of the duties performed in connection with the Bai Sakarbai Dinshaw Petit Hospital for Animals for the year ending 31st December 1906 is embodied in the Report. PROFESSIONAL EXAMINATIONS. 2. Government appointed the following officers to serve on the Board of Examiners for this year:2 passed the Diploma Examination, 4 left having failed at the Diploma Examin- ation, one died and one left on account of illness from Class B, 4 left Class A after having failed at the First Professional Examination and 5 others left Class A in the middle of the year. Of these last mentioned 5, one joined the Training School for Police Officers at Poona, one presumably left on account of his inability to proceed with his studies, one because he had insufficient funds, one because he did not like the profession, and the remaining one was not traced. The number of students attending the College at the close of the official year was 111 as against 89 and 88 in 1905-1906 and 1904-1905, respectively, vide Appendix B. Four students who failed at the Diploma Examination during the last year and who reappeared for the examination without attending the College for the whole year under concession granted in the College Rule 27 are not shown in the appendix, 7. Of 111 students on the College rolls at the end of the year, one each belonged to Palanpur, Baroda, Jamnagar, Dhrangadra, Goa, Vakaner and Sangli; two each to Cutch, Kolhapur, Sind and Indore; three each to Junagad and Bhavnagar; four to the Madras Presidency; eight to Travancore, and 24 to Mysore. The remaining 54 belong to the Bombay Town and the several districts of the Presidency proper. 8. The number of the students who presented themselves for admission was 83 as against 56 and 97 in 1905-1906 and 1904-1905, respectively. Of these students only 49 joined the College. Of the number that joined 17 are Matri- culates and of these 17, 8 are Mysore State scholars. Of the students that did not join the College (numbering 34), three were rejected for poor physique and 5 because of their having failed in the Entrance Test. 9. Of the 49 students who joined, 26 belong to the Bombay Presidency and 5 to the Native States in the Bombay Presidency; 12 came from Mysore, 3 from Travancore, 2 from Madras and 1 from Indore. 10. In the new admissions there are 10 scholarship holders, 8 (mentioned above) from Mysore, one sent by the Kagal State and one by the District Local Board, Ahmednagar. 11. Appendix C shows the different nationalities of students on the College rolls at the end of the year. In the new admissions there are 45 Hindus, 2 Native Christians, 1 Parsi and 1 Mahomedan. SCHOLARSHIPS. 12. As stated in the last Annual Report there were 14 students on the list of Government scholars at the close of the last official year. Of these 14 students, 2 from Class C graduated and 2 left on having failed at the Diploma Examination, One from Class A joined the Training School for Police Officers and one left the College after having failed at the First Profes- sional Examination as stated above. 13. Thus the total number of scholarships being 15, there were 7 vacancies on the list of Government scholars. Twenty candidates recommended by different Collectors as against 14 last year entered the College in January with the view of competing for these vacancies, but only 18 of them presented them- selves for the examination held in March by the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, and myself, They were tested according to the rules for their fitness for Veterinary work and 7 of them were selected to fill up the vacancies, thus bringing up the total number of scholars to the full number, 15. Of the 7 selected, 6 were Matriculates. Seven Matriculates competed for these vacant scholarships, but one of them was rejected on account of bad physique. Of the above-mentioned 20 candidates who joined the College to compete for the vacancies, 5 were recommended by the Collector of the Ratnagiri District, 5 by the Collector of Sholapur, 3 by the Collector of Thana and 1 each by the Collectors of Ahmednagar, Surat, Ahmedabad, Kaira, Bijapur, Belgaum and Dharwar. Of the 7 who were selected, 2 belong to Ratnagiri, 2 to Thana and 1 each to Sholapur, Bijapur and Dharwar.
3 14. Advertisements were inserted in the Vernacular newspapers to the effect that students from any district of the Presidency were eligible on the recommendation of the Collector to compete for the vacant scholarships, and all Collectors were addressed inviting them to recommend suitable students from their districts for the scholarships. 15. A proposal that there should he 21 scholarships of Rs. 15 per mensem each, instead of 15 scholarships of Rs. 10 each as at present, and that the scholar- ships should be offered to men who have passed the Matriculation or School Pinal Examination, with a reservation giving discretionary power to the Principal in special cases to award a scholarship to a man who has not passed one of these tests, has been sanctioned and will come into force from January 1908. TRAINING OF SUPPLY AND TRANSPORT DRIVERS. 16. Forty-seven bullock drivers from the Supply and Transport Depart- ment of the Bombay and Madras Presidencies attended a course of training as dressers during the three months' vacation of the College. All of these men were at the end of the course considered competent to perform the work of dressers. The Principal having represented in his letter No. 671, dated the 30th June 1906, that the location of these transport drivers in the compound of the College while they undergo training causes serious inconvenience, it has been arranged to accommodate them in the Bori Bandar lines from the next year (vide Government Resolution, Educational Department, No. 441, dated the 1st March 1907). FARRIERS' CLASS. 17. Under the orders of Government contained in Government Resolution, Educational Department, No. 220, dated the 80th January 1907, the proposal to institute a Farners' Class at the College was abandoned as it was found on enquiries made by the Principal that adequate use is not likely to be made of the class by the Civil "and Military Authorities and the General Public. EMPLOYMENT OF GRADUATES, 18. Sixteen students passed the Diploma Examination in December last. Of these, 6 are employed by District Local Boards on temporary rinderpest inoculation duty, 1 has been placed in charge of the District Veterinary Dispensary, Panch Mahals, which has been opened during this year, 2 have been appointed as Assistant Veterinary Officers at the College, 1 is employed in the Janjira State and 2 have become Private Practitioners, 19. One Graduate of the last year (December 1905) obtained an appoint- ment as Veterinary Inspector in the Province of Wellesley (Ponang) on a salary of Rs. 960 per annum rising to Rs. 1,440 per annum. 20. During this year Veterinary Dispensaries were opened by the Local Boards of the Ahmednagar, Sholapur and Bijapur Districts and Graduates of previous years were appointed to take charge of them. 21. The Kurla Municipality has engaged the half time services of a Graduate to supervise the Markets and Slaughter Houses at Kurla and a Graduate has been selected for the appointment of Veterinary Inspector in the State of Negri Sembilan of the Federated Malay States on a salary of £ 1304 merit, Madras, also required some Graduates for temporary employment on a salary of Rs. 75, but none were willing to accept the appointments. 23. Enquiries for the services of Graduates were also made by the Baster, Rewali and Shirohi States and by the Superintendent of Police, Kathiawar, but to no effect5 (g) The training of 47 bullock drivers as dressers by the Native Teaching Staff.

Sowerby, I.C.V.D., acted as Principal up to 3rd June and the late Mr. W. A. Broad, I.C.V.D., as Assistant Principal. On my return from leave on the 4th idem I took over the charge of the office of Principal, when Mr. Sowerby reverted to the appointment of Acting Assistant Principal, and the late Mr. Broad, attached for training, was transferred to Poona to do duty under the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency. Mr. N. D. Dhakmarwala, G.B.V.C, Professor of Bovine Pathology, was on privilege leave for one month from the 7th January, when Assistant Professor V. E. Vakharia, G.B.V.C., acted for him as Professor of Bovine Pathology and Mr. P. DeSouza, G.B.V.C., from the Glanders and Farcy Department, Bombay, acted as Assistant Professor of Chemistry. While doing duty under the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Mr. Broad, a most promising officer of the Department, died at Poona. The occurrence of this sad event is deeply regretted by the College staff and students, by whom he was much esteemed. MUSEUM. 80. Some Museum show cases have been obtained in which to place Anatomical Models purchased during the last year and enlargements of photographs with measurements and descriptions of the different breeds of the cattle of the Presidency, taken by Major Joslen when he was Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, have been made and framed. The Museum is as yet comparatively small and incomplete in natural specimens. It is mainly by the preservation of Anatomical and other specimens, both normal and abnormal, that are obtainable from the Hospital that a collection for the Museum is built up and, therefore, the formation of a Museum requires time. Much has been left undone in this direction in the past, but attention will be paid to the matter in future. LIBRARY. 31. Some additions of books have been made to the Library and a special grant of Rs. 550 for the purchase of missing numbers of Journals from England and their binding was sanctioned (Government Resolution, Educational Depart- ment, No. 366, dated the 19th February 1907.) But as the orders of Govern- ment were received too late to incur this outlay during the year we have to apply as far hence as next September for the transfer of the grant to the next year. Government has been pleased to furnish the Library with District Gazetteers and District Maps of the Presidency for reference purposes. The Library, like the Museum, is very incomplete and will require attention. Without a Library for reference we should be working in the dark and probably expend much labour in going over unnecessary ground. The teaching also would not be up to date. PATHO-BACTERIOLOGICAL LABROTORY. 32. The Patho-Bacteriological Laboratory has been put in working order for diagnostic purposes and some of the most urgent requirements for this purpose were obtained locally. A few requisites were received from England at the close of the year and some more, for which a special allotment has been sanctioned by Government (Government Resolution, Educational Depart- ment, No. 339, dated the 15th February 1907), are to be indented for during the ensuing year. An increase in the contingent grant has been applied for for the purpose of procuring annual Bacteriological requisites (vide correspondence ending with this office letter No. 216, dated the 13th February 1907). A bench for microscopical work has been erected in the Laboratory with an extension of the water and gas supply and glass has been put into the doors and windows in place of wooden Venetians, which let in dust, wind and rain. B 2206 33. No bacteriological or microscopical work worth mentioning has been done in the past and no facilities existed for such work, but the so-called Patho-Bacteriological Laboratory is now in working order and as an aid to diagnosis and in the confirmation of diagnosis has already been exceedingly useful. A Veterinary College without such a Laboratory is an impossibility at the present day. When the Subordinate Civil Veterinary Department reaches its full complement much valuable material should be obtainable from the seats of outbreaks of disease in the district and we shall be able to determine with some accuracy what diseases really do exist and their relative importance; we shall also be in a position to demonstrate to the students in a practical and impressive manner the actual causes of disease and the measures it is necessary to adopt for their eradication and prevention. FORGE AND SHOEING SHED. 34. Teakwood Venetians and half doors to replace makeshift chuppras and canvas blinds have been fixed to the Forge and Shoeing Shed and it has been proposed to extend the shed during the next year by throwing out a verandah on its western side, the Shoeing Shed not being large enough to accommodate horses sent to be shod or to protect them and the Shoeing Smiths against the sun and rain. THE PHARMACY. 35. The Pharmacy is much too small for the teaching of practical phar- macy and compounding, and its enlargement has therefore been proposed. This can be effected at little cost by the removal of the partition dividing it from the present Library, which will be removed to the new Government College, and thus throwing the two rooms into one. INFECTIOUS DISEASE WARD, DISSECTION AND POST-MORTEM ROOMS. 36. It is intended to propose to Government that a small infectious disease ward be built on the new College premises for the actual demonstration of certain diseases. The erection of dissection and post-mortem rooms will also be proposed, but the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals have made some objection on sanitary grounds. This objection will, however, I think, be withdrawn when the matter has been further discussed and it is understood what our actual requirements are. Dissection and post-mortem rooms are very much wanted. At present the students have to be taken up to the Lazaretto at Sewree, where there is merely a dark post-mortem room in which dissections have to be carried out as best they can. The room is altogether too small and dark for a dissection class and is moreover required as a post-mortem room in connection with the Glanders and Farcy Department. It need hardly be said that dissections have hitherto been carried out in a most perfunctory manner and that Anatomy is learnt by the students mainly from books and charts. NEW BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY. 37. Plans and estimates for a new Bacteriological Laboratory to be erected in the compound of the new Government Veterinary College are being prepared under the advice of the Inspector General, Civil Veterinary Depart- ment. The Inspector General in his letter No. 457-c., dated the 29th November 1906, writes to the Director of Public Instruction that it is now considered desirable that each Veterinary College should have a properly equipped Labora- tory attached to it and that it be placed in charge of a skilled Pathologist. If this be sanctioned, it will be comparatively a small building, and the present "Patho-Bacteriological Laboratory" will be converted into a Histo-Patho- Bacteriological Class room and dark room for magic lantern exhibitions, photo- micrography, &c., in connection with the new Bacteriological Laboratory, and research and bacteriological investigation work will be confined to the latter building and will be in charge of the proposed skilled Pathologist. This addi- tion to the College staff is much needed. There has been a great amount of
7 material requiring investigation going to waste so to speak in the Bai Sakarbai Hospital for Animals, and the Principal and his Assistant could afford but a very limited amount of time even for ordinary blood examinations, to say nothing of detailed bacteriological work. The Patho-Bacteriological Laboratory, it may be mentioned, is quite unsuited for a Bacteriological Laboratory, in that it is too dark and has no northern aspect. DISSECTIONS. 38. Thirty-three subjects were obtained for dissection and operations as against 26 and 29 in 1905-1906 and 1904-1905, respectively. EXCURSIONS. 39. The students of Class "C" were taken on an excursion tour to the Surat Cattle Show and the Chharodi Cattle Farm by Mr. N. D. Dhakmarwala, Professor of Bovine Pathology. LABORATORY ASSISTANT AND CURATOR. 40. It has been proposed (vide correspondence ending with this office letter No. 355, dated the 16th March 1907) to appoint on a salary of Rs. 758 (6) 992 out-patients were treated in 1906 as against 672 and 610 in 1905 and 1904, respectively, showing an increase of 320 over the last year. (c) Mortality.9 staff the Secretary has afforded them every assistance. I may mention also that all the wards and hospital buildings have been repaired and repainted during the year, some clearings of undergrowth have been made, borders and boundaries put in order, new stable fittings introduced and the sanitary state of the place considerably improved. Mangers are also being put up through- out the horse stalls. These improvements brought about by Mr. Doctor, Secretary, Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, make the Hospital much more attractive and healthy. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, F. JOSLEN, MAJOR, I. C. V. D., Acting Principal, Bombay Veterinary College. B 22011 APPENDIX A. BOMBAY VETERINARY COLLEGE.

SELBY, M.A., Acting Director of Public Instruction, Poona; To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Educational Department, Bombay. SIR, I have the honour to forward the Report of the Bombay Veterinary College, Parel, for 1906-1907, together with a letter from the Director of Agriculture reviewing the report. 2. I agree with what Mr. Mead says in paragraphs 2 and 4 of his letter, 3. It is satisfactory to note that those trained in the College succeed in getting profitable employment: and the paragraph headed "Extra duties" shows the College to be an institution of general utility. 4. The administration and the work of the year reflect credit on the authorities of the College. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, F.G. SELBY, Acting Director of Public Instruction.
17 No. A.-3635 of 1907. From P. J. MEAD, ESQ., I.C.S., Acting Director of Agriculture, Bombay, Poona; To THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION, Poona. Poona, 4th July 1907. SIR, With reference to paragraph 2 of Government Resolution No. 2286, dated 8th December 1906, Educational Department, I have the honour to communicate the following remarks on the Annual Report of the Bombay Veterinary College for 1906-1907, a proof copy of which was received direct from the Government Central Press. 2. The standard estimated by the Committee which met in November 1904 has now been reached and there is every indication that the teaching is becoming more popular and efficient. The percentage of passes is high. 3. The Principal's detailed proposals as regards the various improvements in staff, buildings and equipment are awaited, There are still many wants which can usefully be supplied, but without special grants progress must be slow. 4. The improvement of the material for training depends to a large extent on the careful selection by Collectors of suitable candidates for the Government scholarships. Of the six Government scholars in class A, five were Brahmins. A statement is attached showing the details of caste representation in the various classes. It is thought that neither Vaishyas nor Brahmins should figure largely in the lists of Government scholars. Mahomedans and Kunbis are primâ facie the best material on which to work, and it is difficult to believe that suitable candidates cannot be found. 5. The Principal's estimate of the demand on him for new recruits for the Subordinate Veterinary Service will probably prove to be too high, but detailed proposals have not yet been formulated. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most ohedient Servant, P. J. MEAD, Acting Director of Agriculture. B 22019 BOMBAY VETERINARY COLLEGE.

No. 215-L. OF 1907. BOMBAY VETERINARY COLLEGE: Parel, 11th May 1907. From MAJOR F. JOSLEN, F.R.C.V.S., I.C.V.D., Acting Principal, Bombay Veterinary College; To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. SIR, I have the honour to submit the Annual Report of the Glanders and Farcy Department in Bombay for the year 1906-1907. During this year Mr. M. H. Sowerby, I.C.V.D., held charge of the Department up to 3rd June 1906, and I took over charge from him on the following day. 2. During the year 197 horses were admitted to the Lazaretto at Sewree as against 33 and 38 in 1905-1906 and 1904-1905, respectively. Of these 197 horses one was an obvious case of Glanders, 109 were proved cases of Surra, 58 were seized as suspicious cases and 29 were contacts. Of these 58 suspici- ous cases, 21 proved to be Glandered on being subjected to the Mallein test, 31 proved to be suffering from Surra and 2 from Epizootic Lymphangitis. Two died but not from any of the diseases under the operation of the Act, one (free from disease) was returned to the owner and one was under observation at the Lazaretto at the close of the official year. Of the 29 contacts, 19 proved to be suffering from Glanders on being subjected to the Mallein test, 4 were proved to be suffering from Surra and 6 were returned to their owners as they proved to be free from disease. It will be observed from the above figures that 41 cases were found suffering from Glanders this year as against 17 and 29 in 1905-1906 and 1904- 1905, respectively. Two cases suffering from Lymphangitis Epizootica were destroyed during the year as against 1 and 2 in 1905-1906 and 1904-1905, respectively. One hundred and forty-four cases which were found suffering from Surra were destroyed during this year as against 9 in 1905-1906. Of 197 horses admitted to the Lazaretto, 4 belonged to Persian dealers, 10 to Australian dealers, 51 to the Bombay Electric Supply and Tramways Com- pany, 112 to owners of carriages plying for hire and 20 to private individuals. Of the 41 horses destroyed for Glanders, 2 belonged to private individuals, 3 to Persian dealers, 10 to Australian dealers, 21 to the Bombay Electric Supply and Tramways Company and 5 to owners of carriages plying for hire. Of the 2 horses destroyed for Epizootic Lymphangitis, one was discovered in Harmston's Circus on the day on which the Circus arrived from Calcutta and one belonged to the owner of a carriage plying for hire. Of 144 horses destroyed for Surra, 26 belonged to the Bombay Electric Supply and Tramways Company, 102 to owners of carriages plying for hire and 16 to private indivi- duals. Of the 102 cases of Surra from Bandra, 91 belonged to owners of car- riages plying for hire there and 4 to private individuals. Regarding the different classes of horses, 6 Persians, 37 Country-bred, 82 Arabs and 72 Walers were admitted to the Lazaretto. Of these horses, 3 Persians, 2 Country-bred, 5 Arabs and 31 Walers were destroyed for Glanders; one Waler and 1 Arab for Lymphangitis Epizootica, and 2 Persians, 33 Country-bred, 74 Arabs and 35 Walers were destroyed for Surra. 3. During the year 5,421 horses and 10 mules were imported into Bombay (vide Appendix 1) as against 5,788 and 9,420 in 1905-1906 and 1904-1905, B 22022 respectively. The Australian imports were 2,347 horses and 300 ponies as against 2,424 horses and 257 ponies and 2,522 horses and 281 ponies in 1905- 1906 and 1904-1905, respectively. The Arab imports were 1,617 horses and 658 ponies as against 2,274 horses and 242 ponies and 2,912 horses and 313 ponies in 1905-1906 and 1904-1905, respectively. The Persian imports were 289 horses and 65 ponies as against 383 horses and 3 ponies and 579 horses in 1905-1906 and 1904-1905, respectively. The Austro-Hungarian imports were 6 horses as against 11 and 164 in 1905-1906 and 1904-1905, respectively. Ten mules were imported this year as against 5 and 2,268 in 1905-1906 and 1904-1905, respectively. Of the abovementioned imported horses, 3 were sent to the Lazaretto at Sewree at the time of debarkation23 over both before and after landing. Regarding the inspection of horses for ticks, it is obvious that it would be impossible to pronounce a shipload of horses free from them before they were taken out of the ship and it would be very easy to overlook them afterwards. 10. Appendix II is the Financial Statement for the year under Report. It will be observed from the statement that there is an increase in expenditure which is mainly due to extra cost incurred on account of the burning of carcasses of horses destroyed under the Glanders and Farcy Act. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, F. JOSLEN, MAJOR, I.C.V.D., Acting Principal, Bombay Veterinary College.

27 No. 802 OF 1907. From K. HEWLETT, Esq., I.C.V.D., Acting Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency; To THE UNDER SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. Poona, 20th June 1907. SIR, I have the honour to submit, for the consideration of His Excellency the Governor in Council, the Annual Administration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, for the official year 1906-07. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, K. HEWLETT, I.C.V.D., Acting Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency. THROUGH THE DIRECTOR OF AGRICULTURE, BOMBAY, Poona.
ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT IN THE BOMBAY PRESIDENCY FOR THE YEAR 1906-07. Mr. K. Hewlett held charge as Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Depart- ment, Bombay Presidency, throughout the year under report. 2. The Superintendent was away from head-quarters for 175 days during the year as against 152 days last year. He travelled 19,831 miles by rail, 860 miles by road and 45 miles by sea, as against 14,697 by rail, 486 by road and 298 by sea last year. In addition to the above the Superintendent in his capacity of Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Sind, Baluchistan and Rájputána, travelled 3,461 miles by rail and 72 miles by road. 3. Tours were made in connection with cattle breeding, horse breeding and contagious diseases of animals in various parts of the Presidency. The following State studs were visited:30 addition to the above 16 horses were reported to have died from this disease in Kolába District but as diagnosis was not confirmed by microscopical examination they are not included. There was also a fairly extensive outbreak of the disease among camels in Ahmedabad but no statistics are available. Epizootic Lymphangitis.31 11. It may be seen from the above that the people took to anti-rinderpest inoculation more readily in the Thána and Ahmednagar Districts than elsewhere and Veterinary Graduates Phatak (Thána) and Washikar (Ahmednagar) deserve credit for the success which they have attained in popularising the process in their respective districts. The numbers of inoculations performed in Kaira District are very disappointing and the Superintendent considers that a man of Veterinary Graduate Patel's experience, influence and service in the district should have done much more. In the following districts no inoculations were performed:32 those in which fees arc levied on those anle to pay, (II) those in which treat- ment is free to all. The cattle population within a radius of five miles of each dispensary is shown and the relation which the number of cattle treated bears to it is worked out as a percentage with the object of showing to what extent the institutions are being utilised by cattle owners and for purposes of com- parison. 17. Dhulia Dispensary.33 year, an increase of 272. Of the total number of cases 493 were equines, 2,556 bovines, 217 others. Veterinary Graduate Reuben visited 11 villages affected with rinderpest and inoculated 322 cattle against the disease. He attended the horses of the Mounted Police and the Pinjrapole animals and inspected the stallion at Násik frequently. The dispensary has increased in popularity and Mr. Reuben has done good work during the year. The cattle population within five miles from the dispensary is 14,189 and the number of cattle treated is 2,556, giving a percentage of 18.01. Fees are levied at this dispensary. 22. Násik Itinerating Dispensary.34 treated 408 were equines, 279 bovines and 514 others. The Veterinary Graduates of this dispensary attended outbreaks of rinderpest in the vicinity of Poona and inoculated animals against the disease. Eighteen castrations were performed by the graduates as against seven last year. The absurdly small number of cattle, many of which are Government animals, and the large numbers of horses and small animals included in the total of cases treated cannot be regarded as satisfactory for a District Veterinary Dispensary although probably as an educational institution the dispensary fully justifies its existence. The cattle population within five miles of the dispensary amounts to 12,311 and 279 cattle were treated, giving a percentage of 2.26. Fees are levied at the dispensary. 26. Poona City Dispensary.35 29. Chikodi Dispensary.36 1906. The total number of cases treated at the dispensary was 2,639 as against 1,382 last year which shows the very considerable increase of 1,257. The Veterinary Graduate attributes this increase to the continuous working of the institution owing to the presence of the Salutri at head-quarters who took charge while the Veterinary Graduate was on tour and also to the growing popularity of the institution. It is probable that these reasons are in the main the correct ones. In addition to the cases treated at the dispensary the graduate treated 554 cases while on tour as against 387 last year, and paid 497 visits to treat animals at the owners' stables as against 345 last year. Of the total number of cases treated at the dispensary 41 were equines, 2,422 bovines and 176 others. The Veterinary Graduate was on tour 93 days during the year visiting outbreaks of disease. He travelled 516 miles by land and 610 by sea. He has performed his duties in a satisfactory manner and has shown zeal and ability. He visited outbreaks of disease with promptitude and had to undergo not inconsiderable hardships while visiting remote villages during the monsoon. The cattle population within five miles of the dispensary amounts to 8,697, and the number of cattle treated amount to 2,422, which gives a percentage of 27.8537 was 2,176 as against 1,706 last year, an increase of 470. Of these 720 were equines, 1,000 bovines and 456 others. In addition to those attended to at the hospital, the Veterinary Graduate treated 117 cases when on tour. He per- formed five castrations, visited outbreaks of rinderpest and other contagious diseases, inoculated 1,900 animals against rinderpest, treated animals of Govern- ment Farm and Mounted Police, regularly attended the Saturday cattle market and certified ponies fit for license for public conveyances, The work of both Veterinary Graduates has been satisfactory, but there is still roam for con- siderable increase in the number of patients treated. The cattle population within five miles of the dispensary is 17,000 and the number of cattle treated is 1,000, giving a percentage of 5.88, which is low. Fees are charged at this dispensary. Itinerating Salutri D. P. Thakor was on duty throughout the year with the exception of one month's privilege leave. He visited 75 villages as against 41 last year and treated 988 cases as against 867. He visited outbreaks of disease and advised the people with regard to the measures of prevention. 37. Nadiád Dispensary.--Veterinary Graduate P. D. Maniar held charge with the exception of the period from December 8th to March 7th, when he was on privilege leave and when Veterinary Graduate Patel held charge in addition to his own duties. The dispensary was inspected on 17th November 1906. The total number of cases treated was 3,835 as against 3,396 last year, an increase of 439. Of the total treated 327 were equines, 2,889 were bovines and 619 others. The Veterinary Graduate states that 45 per cent. of the patients come from surrounding villages. In addition to the above cases the Veterinary Graduate treated 126 cases while on tour. He visited outbreaks of black quarter, foot and mouth discase, hæmorrhagic septicæmia and rinderpest, but unfortunately did not perform any preventive inoculations. He inspected the Government stallions at Nadiád and Kaira; translated at the request of the Superintendent a leaflet on rinderpest into Gujaráti, He per- formed the Itinerating Graduate's duties in addition to his own from June 26th to 5th September 1906. The Veterinary Graduate's work at the dispensary continues to be highly satisfactory, but it is regrettable that he was unable to perform any inoculations. The cattle population within a radius of: five miles is 13,801 and the number of cattle treated was 2,889, giving a percentage of 20.93. Treatment is free to all at the dispensary. 38. Kaira Itinerating Dispensary.38 inspected on 30th July 1906 and visited on several occasions. The total number of cases treated at the dispensary amounted to 4,650 as against 4,185 last year, an increase of 465. Of the total treated 1,200 were equines, 2,131 were bovines and 1,319 others. The Veterinary Graduate attended the weekly cattle market, visited the stallions at Ahmedabad, visited the Pinjrapoles, investigated an out- break of camel surra, visited outbreaks of anthrax and rinderpest, &c. The extension to the dispensary is under construction, During the year a Salutri was employed to assist Mr. Bhat with his dispensary work. The cattle popu- lation within five miles of the dispensary is 12,839 and the number of cattle treated is 2,131, giving a percentage of 16.6. Mr. Bhat has performed his duties as usual in a highly satisfactory manner. Treatment at this dispensary is free to all. III.89 The pony stallions " Gift" and " Nissan " died during the year. At the close of the year there were 18 stallions, via., 6 horses and 12 ponies, at the following stands :40 expended in prizes. There were some fine cattle present and the show is serving a useful purpose. The Sholápur Cattle Show.41 General Remarks. 53. The scheme for the re-organisation of the Subordinate Civil Veterinary Department in the Bombay Presidency under which the service becomes a provincial and pensionable one was sanctioned in the year under report in Government Resolution, Revenue Department, No. 1615, dated 14th February 1907, but has not as yet been brought into force.

55 No. 9657 SIND. ANNUAL ADMNISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT IN SIND FOR THE YEAR 1906-1907. GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. During the year under report Mr. K. Hewlett held charge of the office of the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Sind, Baluchistan and Rájputána, Captain Dawson being absent on leave, in addition to his own duties as Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency. 2. The Superintendent was unable to undertake a detailed tour in Sind this year on account of his time being very fully occupied in the Presidency Proper and other parts of his charge. He attended the Horse and Cattle Show at Talhar, Hyderabad District. He travelled 2,089 miles by rail as against 3,09-1 miles by rail and 387 by road last year. I.68 (3) Veterinary Hospitals and Dispensaries. 7. There were six Veterinary Dispensaries open at the end of the year. Of these five, namely, Karachi, Hyderabad, Nausháhro, Lárkána and Shikárpur may be described as Veterinary Hospitals as there is accommodation for in-door pati- ents. The new dispensary building at Nausháhro is nearing completion and the establishment of a dispensary at Sukkur is under contemplation. 8. The following is a review of the work done in each dispensary during the year. For purposes of comparison the cattle population within a radius of five miles of each dispensary is shown and the relation which the number of cattle treated bears to it is worked out as a percentage with the object of show- ing to what extent the institutions are being utilised by cattle owners. It is also noted in the review of each dispensary whether treatment is entirely free or if fees are levied. 9. Karáchi Dispensary.59 year, an increase of 271. Of these 334 were equines, 343 bovines and 166 others. There were 88 in-patients and 755 out-patients. The Veterinary- Graduate also treated 232 cases while on tour. He visited the Jacobabad and Shikárpur Horse Shows. Treatment at this dispensary is free to all except persons whose animals are sent to the dispensary under the Cruelty to Animals Act, who are charged. The Veterinary Graduate performed five castrations. His work has been satisfactory. The cattle population within a radius of 5 miles is 17,855 and the number of cattle treated is 343, giving a percentage of 1.92. 13. Shikárpur Dispensary.60 The Comptroller, India Treasuries, when furnishing the information, remarks that as no separate accounts of these Provinces are kept in his office, separate statements showing the charges in each Province cannot be furnished, and hence the statement is headed to show expenditure in the Provinces of Sind, Baluchistan and Rájputána. The information supplied by the Accountant General does not appear to be correct as it seems that expenses incurred on behalf of the Army Remount Department, such as prizes at Horse Shows, &c., have been included in the state- ment, and on pointing out the fact to him he says there is nothing in the vouchers furnished to his office to show that the figures include expenses on account of the Army Remount Department. 19. On comparing the accounts shown in column 2 with the registers of this office it is found that these expenses were incurred by the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Sind, Baluchistan and Rájputána, at Karáchi and relate only to the Province of Sind with the exception of Rs. 500 awarded as prizes at the Cattle Fair held at Sibi (Baluchistan), and thus Rs. 8,340-4-9 were expended from Imperial and Rs. 28,593-6-1 from Local Funds as against Rs. 4,571-4-11 and Rs. 19,044, respectively, last year. The increase in the Imperial figures is due to the fact that last year the office of the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, was located at Ajmer from April to December 1905 and therefore the expenses incurred there were shown in the Annual Report of Rájputána. The sum of Rs. 302-12-0 on account of the Travelling Allowance of the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, as shown in column 3 has been wrongly shown under " Provincial" instead of " Imperial," to which it is actually debitable.

Poona, 15th August 1907. Submitted to Government. 2. The main feature of the year is Rinderpest. The following statement shows the extent of epidemic cattle diseases in the Presidency Proper during the year under report as compared with last year:68 The figures for Sind are given below : Year. Number of Veterinary Assistants. Number of animals treated at Head- quarters. Number of animals treated in villages. Total number treated. Average per Veterinary Assistant. Number of villages visited. Remarks. 1906-07 ... 6 10,927 1,941 12,868 2,144 112 1905-06 ... 6 9,570 1,414 10,984 1,830 173 1904-05 ... 5 7,656 1,037 8,693 1,738 141 1901-02 ... 4 5,646 56 5,702 1,435 45 An examination of the figures shows a steady development of the popularity of these institutions, apart from the abnormal rise due to the severe epidemic in the Presidency Proper. In 1905-06 out of 16 Veterinary Assistants in charge of stationary dispensaries in the Presidency Proper, six Veterinary Assistants treated 320 animals for non-contagious diseases in villages, with an average of 53 animals per each Veterinary Assistant. In 1906-07, out of the same 16 Veterinary Assistants in charge of stationary dispensaries (excluding those at Nagar, Sholápur, Bijápur, and Godhra, which were opened during the year under report), 9 Veteri- nary Assistants treated 1,531 animals for non-contagious diseases in villages with an average of 170 animals per each Veterinary Assistant. Had the time of stationary Veterinary Assistants not been taken up by measures for the repres- sion of contagious disease, this figure would probably have been still greater. The minimum of 2,000 animals laid down in Government Resolution No. 9468, dated 23rd November 1905, Revenue Department, has been exceeded at 11 of the 16 old dispensaries, as against 6 in 1905-06. Mr. Hewlett's appreciation of the work of the various Veterinary Assistants may be generally accepted, but his knowledge of the Sind establishment and conditions is not equal to his knowledge of the personnel and the work in the Presidency Proper. His adverse opinion on the work of the Nausháhro Veterinary Assistant, Mr. Ansari, has since been modified and, primá facie, the figures hardly support his strictures on the work done in the Hyderabad District. The popularity of a dispensary is also considerably affected by changes. Both Surat and Chikodi dispensaries would seem to have been badly treated in this respect. Mr. Kshir- sagar's work at Násik undoubtedly requires closer supervision. It is proposed to give him a further trial; he has already been warned. In comparing the percent- age figures of cattle treated on the five mile radius basis, allowance must be made for dispensaries which were only open for part of the year. The true percentages for Nagar and Sholápur should be 9 and 10 respectively. Effect has been given to the suggestion made in paragraph 2 of Government Resolution No. 10857 of 15th November 1906, Revenue Department, and monthly returns are now received from all the Veterinary Assistants. No final decision has yet been passed in connection with the location of the Thána branch dispensary, but the District Local Board has decided that it shall be located at either Kalyán or Bhiwndi. 4. Government grants-in-aid were sanctioned in the case of the following dispensaries during the year under report:69 Government sanction to the grants-in-aid to the Veterinary dispensaries in the sátára District was received in May last and the necessary arrangements are being made for their establishment. Dispensary buildings at Belgaum, Surat, Chikodi and Jacobabad are under contemplation. The Poona City Dispensary buildings have formed the subject of a separate report to Government. 5. Table VI would be more interesting if the figures under contingencies were explained by remarks showing the amounts expended on buildings, and the same remark applies to the tables in the Annual Report by the Inspector-General, Civil Veterinary Department. The following table is given to compare expendi- ture in the different provinces:Annual Reports.

No. 11970. REVENUE DEPARTMENT. Bombay Castle, 5th December 1907. Letter from the Principal, Bombay Veterinary College, No. 215.L., dated 11th May 19072 5. The main feature of the year was the extensive prevalence of rinder- pest, which was especially severe in Thána and Ahmednagar. The Governor in Council views with decided satisfaction the progress made in inoculation. There can bo no doubt that the prejudices against it are far from invincible. Much credit is due to the staff employed and to the Superintendent for the degree of success attained. It is true, as stated by Mr. Hewleit, that this depends principally on the energy and tact of the inoculating officers. But a great deal also depends on the assistance and countenance given by District officers from the Collector down to the Mámlatdár, and mention should be made in every report of the co-operation afforded by these officers. 6. The figures given by Mr. Mead of increased number of treatments at Veterinary Dispensaries and outside them are striking and satisfactory. There can be no doubt that these institutions are progressing in popularity. It is disappointing however that a largo city like Poona should yield such poor results compared with, say, Ahmedabad or even a small town like Ratnágiri, and the Director should consider the advisability of posting one of his best officers to Poona. Sholápur is another place where good results might be expected, and a thoroughly efficient man should be posted there Government regret to observe no better results in the Poona District Dispensary. The Superintendent remarks that this Dispensary may be satisfactory as an educational institution, but that better results might reasonably be expected in numbers treated. This opinion is not decided enough. The Superintendent should examine carefully into the working of the institution and report fully on its efficiency and the extent to which improvement is possible. 7. Sind suffered, as the Commissioner and Superintendent both justly observe, from lack of supervision, due entirely to the devolution of the duties to the Presidency Superintendent who has not time for them. The Government of India have now appointed a separate officer to Sind, Baluchistan and Rájputana. The result will, it is hoped, be increased progress. 8. Mr. Hewlett has done a remarkably excellent year's work and has shown himself one of the best of the several efficient Superintendents who have been employed in the Presidency. M. K.

ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE BOMBAY VETERINARY COLLEGE AND CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT IN THE BOMBAY PRESIDENCY INCLUDING SIND FOR THE OFFICIAL YEAR 1907-1908.
No. 628 OF 1908. BOMBAY VETERINARY COLLEGE : Parel, 4th June 1908. From MAJOR E. JOSLEN, F.R.C.V.S., I.C.V.D., Principal, Bombay Veterinary College; To THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION, Poona. SIR, I have the honour to submit this the twenty-second Annual Report of the Bombay Veterinary College dealing with its administration during the official year 1907-1908. From the 7th December 1907 to the 6th March 1908, Mr. M. H. Sowerby, I.C.V.D., was in charge of the College while I was on special leave and Mr. E. Ware, I.C.V.D., was appointed to act as Assistant Principal. A brief outline of the duties performed in connection with the Bai Sakerbai Dinshaw Petit Hospital for Animals for the year ending the 31st December 1907 is embodied in the report. PROFESSIONAL EXAMINATIONS. 2. Government appointed the following Officers to serve on the Board of Examiners :2 Class C after having failed at the same examination (total 25), 5 that left from Class B and 15 from Class A. The number of students attending the College at the close of the official year was 107 as compared to 111 and 98 in 1906-1907 and 1905-1906, respect- ively. Pour students, who failed in December 1906 and left, re-entered the College in July 1907 ; they were, therefore, not on the College rolls at the beginning of the official year 1907-1908. They appeared for examination in December of the same year and passed and are shown in Appendix A but not in Appen- dix B. Of the 107 students on the College rolls at the end of the year one each belonged to Ceylon, Cutch, Gondal, Vákáner, and Goa; two each to Indore, Sind, Jámnagar, Sángli and Kolhápur; four to Bhávnagar ; five each to Madras and Travancore and 33 to Mysore. The remaining 45 belonged to the town of Bombay and the several districts of the Presidency proper. The number of men, who presented themselves in December 1907 as can- didates for admission as students, was 73 as against 83 in 1906-1907 and 56 in 1905-1906, Of these new men only 41 eventually joined the College at the beginning of the course in January (Appendix B). Of these 16 are Matricu- lates and School Pinal men. Of the other 32 men who did not join one was rejected as morally unfit, three were rejected as physically unfit and 6 because they failed to pass the Entrance Test. Eight who were Matriculates and six who passed the Entrance Test (required of men without any qualifications), did not join and 8 who were without any qualifications did not come up for the Entrance Test. Of the 41 new students who eventually joined the College, 17 belonged to the Bombay Presidency, 14 to Mysore, 4 to Native States in the Bombay Pre- sidency, 2 to Travancore and one each to Sind, Goa, Ceylon and Bengal. In the new admissions there are 5 scholarship holders3 Advertisements were put in the Vernacular newspapers to the effect that there were 13 vacant Government scholarships of Rs. 15 each per mensem and the Collectors and Head Masters of High Schools in the different districts of the Presidency were addressed with a view to their recommending suitable men from their districts for the scholarships, but from the figures given above it will he seen that but few were forthcoming in the end. BAI SAKERBAI DINSHAW PETIT HOSPITAL FOR ANIMALS. 5. The records of the Bai Sakerbai Dinshaw Petit Hospital for Animals give the following information relative to patients admitted, viz,:4 EXTRA DUTIES. 9. The following extra duties were performed, viz.:5 MUSEUM. 14. Mr. N. D. Dhakmarvala was deputed to visit the Lahore Veterinary College and take notes, in particular in regard to the Museum and the mounting and preservation of specimens. At the request of the Principal with the support of the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, Graduates furnished patholo- gical and parasitical specimens for the Museum. Glass show cases at a cost of Rs. 3,438 derived from a special grant sanctioned by Government and from the contingent grant were obtained for the Museum. The following is a list of additions to the Museum during the year:6 OFFICE AND MENIAL ESTABLISHMENT. 24. Mr. Ranade, Second Clerk, has again been on leave during the greater part of the year. Mr. G. L. Palnitker has been acting for him. On the Menial Establishment five additional men for the new College and students' quarters were sanctioned for 1908-09. THE NEW COLLEGE. 25. The New College building is nearing completion and will probably be ready for occupation about July next. DONORS OF PRIZES. 26. Sir Dinshaw Manekji Petit, Bart., and the Bayley Memorial Fund Committee contributed to the prize fund. Thanks are due to them for the same. 27. Appendix D is the financial statement and Appendix E is the state- ment showing main results of the College for the year. 28. A special grant of Rs. 8,319 to procure instruments, appliances and requisites for different departments of the College was sanctioned and an indent for them has been sent to England and some of the articles indented for were received before the clsoe of the year. 29. The College Staff has worked well during the year. Good work has been done in the preparation of specimens for the Museum by Mr. M. H. Sowerby, Mr. Shaik and Mr. Miranda of the Glanders and Farcy Department. 30. My thanks are again due to Mr. Manickshaw Doctor, Secretary, Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, for the cordial co-operation at all times in matters more particularly relating to the treatment of animals and sanitation. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, F. JOSLEN, Major, I.C.V.D., Principal, Bombay Veterinary College.

It is obvious that the training given in the College is very widely appreciated; and it is satisfactory to notice that successful students find no difficulty in getting remunerative employment. 3. Several improvements in the material equipment of the College have been made during the year. 4. Now that the rent of rooms in the Hostel has been reduced I trust that the number of residents will increase. 5. As to the selection of scholars I hope soon to submit proposals to Government as the present system does not seem to yield very satisfactory results. 6. The report, I think, bears instance to the zeal and energy of the staff; and the College is plainly a source of many incidental benefits to the City of Bombay as well as to the Mofussil. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, P. G. SELBY, Director of Public Instruction.
12 No. A/3764 or 1908. From G. P. KEATINGE, ESQUIRE, I.C.S., Director of Agriculture, Bombay, Poona; To THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION, Poona. Poona, 25th June 1908. Sir, In accordance with the orders contained in Government Resolution No. 2286, dated 8th December 1906, Educational Department, I have the honour to forward herewith my remarks on the annual report submitted by the Principal, Bombay Veterinary College; and in view of the remarks in paragraph 3 of Government Resolution No. 11970 of 5th December 1907, Revenue Department, I venture to point out that last year only 20 days elapsed between the receipt of the report in this office and the despatch of the Director of Agriculture's remarks, and that this year only nine days have elapsed. 2. The results of the year's work appear to have been satisfactory, and a good proportion of the students examined passed their examinations. 3. The want of an Anatomical room (vide para. 2 of the Principal's report), and the want of facilities for making the students acquainted with contagious diseases (vide paras. 8 and 10 of the Principal's report) are both subjects which I have considered during the past year. I was waiting for Major Joslen's return to discus9 the matter with him; but as he unfortunately fell ill shortly after his return and has again taken leave I must wait for Mr. Sowerby's return from leave next month, and will then discuss the matter with him and address you on the subject. 4. It is noticeable that only 47 students at the College belong to this Presidency, and that of them 16 are Government scholars, that is to say, only 31 paying students come from the Presidency. The supply of trained men is, however, equal to the demand. 5. I have recently addressed you on the subject of the selection of the Government scholars and stated that in my opinion the existing method of selecting them is not calculated to get the class of students which we want. I have suggested that instead of waiting for boys to come to us, we should hunt for the right class in the High Schools throughout the Presidency. The remarks of the Principal bear out my previous contention; and I trust that the system will soon be altered; since the future of the Civil Veterinary Department depends on our getting the right class of men. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, G. E. KEATINGE, Director of Agriculture.

The Persian imports were 236 horses as against 289 horses and 65 ponies and 383 horses and 3 ponies in 1906-1907 and 1905-1906, respectively. There were no Hungarian horses imported this year as against 6 and 11 in 1906-1907 and 1905-1906, respectively. Nine Arab, 43 Catalonian, 13 Italian and 2 Siberian donkeys were imported during this year. Of the abovementioned imported horses 22 were sent to the Sewree Laza- retto from the harbour, 18 as suspicious and 4 as contacts. Out of these, 3 reacted to Mallein and were destroyed for Glanders, one died free from diseases under the Act and 18 were returned to their owners. Besides these, 1 Persian and 16 Arab horses were tested in the dealers' stables, out of which 1 Persian reacted to the Mallein test and was removed to the Sewree Lazaretto and destroyed or Glanders. 4. Six consignments of horses came from Queensland and were inspected for ticks, but none were found on them. 5. Fifty-eight Government donkey stallions were taken charge of by this Department and were handed over to the agents of the different Provinces in India on their arrival here. Of these, 18 were subjected to the mallein test as desired by the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Lahore, but none of them reacted. 6. During this year Veterinary Inspector J. M. C.

ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT IN THE BOMBAY PRESIDENCY FOR THE YEAR 1907-08. Mr. K. Hewlett held charge as Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Depart- ment, Bombay Presidency, throughout the year under report. 2. The Superintendent was away from head-quarters for 2l7 days during the year as against 175 days last year. He travelled 14,816 miles by rail, 1,036 miles by road, and 383 miles by sea as against 19,831 miles by rail, 860 miles by road, and 45 miles by sea last year. In addition to the above, the Superintendent in his capacity of Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Sind, Baluchistan and Rájputána travelled 932 miles by rail, and 18 mile3 by road. 3. Tours were made in connection with cattle breeding, horse breeding and contagious diseases of animals in various parts of the Presidency. The following State studs were visited:20 Glanders21 treated 12,765 cases while on tour, of which 5,695 were contagious diseases and 7,070 were non-contagious diseases as compared with a total of 13,451 last year. The total number of cases treated as in and out patients by Veterinary Assist- ants at their head-quarters is 43,517 as compared with 40,347 last year and 30,075 year before last. This gives a total number of 56,282 cases treated by Veterinary Assistants throughout the Presidency as against 53,798 last year, an increase of 2,484. (3).22 The total number of eases treated at the dispensary was 1,565 as against 1,338 last year, an increase of 227. Of these 204 were equines, 1,283 bovines, and 78 others. In addition to the above number the Veterinary Graduate treated 314 animals for contagious diseases, 517 for non-contagious diseases and castrated one horse and 6 bulls while on tour. He performed four post mortem examina- tions. The cattle population within the radius of five miles of the dispensary amounts to 5,428 and the number of cattle treated at the dispensary is 1,283, giving a percentage of 23.65. Fees are levied at this dispensary. 17. Násik Dispensary.23 deputed to attend the course of instruction in anti-rinderpest inoculation at Bareilly. Although Veterinary Graduate Shirsathe was appointed on 21st May 1907, the real work of the dispensary of treating cases commenced from 10th August 1907 when he was provided with medicines and instruments. The total number of cases treated during the time the dispensary was open was 433, of which 202 were treated at the head-quarters and 231 in the district. Of these 67 were equines, 347 bovines, and 19 others. In addition to these the Veterinary Graduate attended outbreaks of rinderpest and inoculated 3,824 animals against the disease. He also attended the Mhaswad Cattle Fair in connection with the purchase of stud bulls for the Ahmednagar district, and attended and acted as one of the Judges at the Sangamner cattle show. 22. Poona District Dispensary.24 performed five castrations. The cattle population within the radius of 5 miles of the dispensary is 4,22.7 and the number of cattle treated is 460 giving a percentage of 1088. Pees are not livied at this dispensary and treatment is free to all. 26. Belgaum Dispensary.25 and the number of cattle treated is 1,621, giving a percentage of 13.75. Pees are charged at this dispensary. 30. Dhárwár Itinerating Dispensary.26 deputed to visit and control outbreaks of contagious disease. He was also sent to Bareilly from 26th December 1907 to 6th February 1908 to attend the course of instruction in preventive inoculation. No medicines and instruments were supplied to him till January 1908 and there was no accommodation for the dispensary till 1st March 1908. The number of cases treated at the dis- pensary is 636 and whilst on tour is 335, which is satisfactory. The Veterinary Graduate was away from head-quarters for 199 days, visited 52 villages to attend outbreaks of contagious diseases and inoculated 1,036. animals against rinder- pest. The cattle population within the radius of five miles from Panvel is 13,000 and the number of cattle treated is 588 which gives a percentage of 4.52. Treatment at this dispensary is free to all. 35. Thana Dispensary.27 38. Kaira Itinerating Dispensary.28 type for sale to the cattle-breeders of Gujarát and thus supply a want which is now becoming acute. Management of the farm has been carried out in accord- ance with the proposals made by the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Depart- ment, in his letter No. 385, dated 19th April 1906, to the address of the Director of Agriculture, Bombay. The land cultivated and crops grown have been in accordance with the suggestions of Mr. Mollison, Inspector-General of Agricul- ture. At the commencement of the year under report the herd consisted of 3 stock bulls, 110 cows, 88 heifers, 17 heifer calves, 3 yearling bulls, 22 bull calves, 12 castrated stock and at the close of the year it consisted of 5 stock bulls, 140 cows, 82 heifers, 24 heifer calves, 13 two year old bulls, 17 yearling bulls, 16 bull calves, 12 castrated stock. During the year under report two stock bulls were purchased for use on the farm and 6 heifers, 20 young castrated male stock were sold. There are 13 young bulls which will be ready for issue in the cold weather of 1908 and it is hoped that this number will be turned out annually. The fodder crops grown on the farm this year failed owing to the rains being unfavourable. The hay crop amounted to 836,000 lbs. Build- ings are urgently needed for the farm, but when those now sanctioned are completed the estate will be satisfactorily provided in this respect as a cattle- breeding farm. The Manager Mr. P. V. Nagarshet has worked well throughout the year and has shown himself to be reliable and careful. The Superin- tendent considers that he deserves credit for the way in which he has carried out his duties. (2).29 46. The cost of feel, keep and transit of Government horse and pony stallions is given in Table XII and the average cost for the last two years is compared below:30 in a highly satisfactory manner and has proved himself to be an officer of tact, ability and energy.

45 REVIEW BY THE DIRECTOR OF AGRICULTURE, BOMBAY. No. A/4204 OF 1908. Poona, 16th July 1908. Forwarded with compliments. 2. Mr. Ware has not expressed any detailed opinion as to the value of the work accomplished by the Civil Veterinary Department, doubtless because ho has had no personal experience of the matter. I regret that I am not yet in a position to supply this omission. 3. The year was again an unhealthy one, in spite of a slight decline in the mortality from rinderpest and foot and mouth disease; and cases of Hæmorr- hagic Septicæmia and Black Quarter showed a marked increase. The large losses of cattle from contagious disease appear to me to indicate the direction in which the energies of the Department will find most scope in the future. 4. As regards non-contagious disease treated at the dispensaries, if the figures for the year under report are compared with those of the previous year it will be found that, excluding the newly opened dispensaries, there has been an increase of 2,000 cases treated. This appears to indicate a development of popularity. The Poona City dispensary, to which Government specially re- ferred last year, shows a marked improvement, and the Ratnágiri figures are remarkbly good, and indicate that the Veterinary Assistant there must have won the confidence of the surrounding cultivators. The establishment of friendly relations between the Veterinary Assistant and the surrounding culti- vators must in great degree be a personal question, and any attempt to force the services of the Veterinary Assistant on the people would be likely to do more harm than good; but it seems to me probable that when the Agricultural Department has established a closer touch with the villagers of certain tracts it might be able to help the Civil Veterinary Department in this respect; and apart from the mere treatment of disease the two departments might work together for the dissemination of better notions on the subjects47 No. 18249 SIND. ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE INDIAN CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT IN SIND FOR THE OFFICIAL YEAR 1907-1908. GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. During the year under report Mr. K. Hewlett, Superintendent, Indian Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, remained in charge of the office of Superintendent, Indian Civil Veterinary Department, Sind, Baluchistan and Rájputána, from 1st April to 24th November 1907 when Major Trydell took over from him on the forenoon of 25th idem and held it to the end of the year. 2. Mr. Hewlett, while in charge of the office of Superintendent, Indian Civil Veterinary Department, Sind, Baluchistan and Rájputána, was unable to visit the Province. Major Trydell visited all the six dispensaries, toured in parts of the districts of Hyderabad and Karáchi and attended the Cattle shows held at Shikárpur, Talhar and Moro. He travelled 2,878 miles by rail and 339 by road during his four months' tenure as against 2,089 miles by rail travelled last year. I.50 of the year. No deaths occurred amongst the inoculated animals. In the out- break of " Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia " reported from Sukkur District, serum not being available no inoculations were performed. The Veterinary Assistant visited the scenes of outbreak of Anthrax but the disease had died out before his visits to the places of occurrence. (2) Other diseases. 6. There was 1 death amongst Equines and 28 amongst Bovines from other contagious diseases as against 13 reported last year. Besides these the Veterinary Assistants treated 2,457 oases while on tour of which 323 were con- tagious and 2,123 non-contagious and 11 castration cases as compared to 1,956 of which 489 were contagious and 1,452 non-contagious and 15 castration oases treated last year. The total number of oases treated by Veterinary Assistants as in and out-door patients at their dispensrries is 11,846 as compared with 10,927 treated last year. This gives a total number of 14,303 cases treated during the year as compared to 12,883 treated during the preceding year in the Province. (3) Veterinary Hospitals and Dispensaries. 7. There were 6 Veterinary Dispensaries open during the year under report, of these five, viz., Karáchi, Hyderabad, Naushahro, Lárkána, Shikárpur, the same as last year, have accommodation for in-door patients. There are proposals in progress to build new dispensary at Lárkána. The question of building a dispensary at Sukkur is still under contemplation and a new dispen- sary at Hálla is also under construction. 8. Karáchi Dispensary.51 and 1,948 out-patients as against 212 and 1,831 respectively last year. The Veterinary Graduate performed 12 castrations as against 9 last year. He attended the Fair at Talhar and treated the horses belonging to Thar and Párkar Police. The cattle population within a radius of 5 miles of Hyderabad is 6,303 and the number of cattle treated is 746 giving a percentage of 11.83 as against 18.16 last year. The decrease in the percentage of cattle treated is due to the fact that last year the number of camels treated at this dispensary was included in Bovines while this year it has not been done so. Vide Table "VI, Rs. 5,887-6-8 are shewn under the head " Receipts " and Rs. 3,942-8-4 under the head "Expenditure" which gives a balance of Rs. 1,944-14-4 at the close of the year. The salutri attached to this dispensary who tours in the district treated 527 cases while on tour and performed no castrations against 394 and 8 respect- ively last year. Pees are charged at the dispensary. Naushahro Dispensary.52 Table VI shows the receipts, expenditure and the balance available which are Rs. 15,902-1-7, Re. 5,220-4-7 and Rs. 10,681-13-0 respectively. The treatment at this dispensary is free. The cattle population within 5 miles of this dispensary is 6,000 and the number of cattle treated 745 which gives a percentage of 12.41 as against 11.05 last year.

59 Below the Superintendent, Indian Civil Veterinary Department, Sind, Balu- chistan and Rájputána's No, 182-54, dated 39th June 1908, forwarding the Administration Report of the Indian Civil Veterinary Department for the year 1907-08. No. G.-394 of 1908. GENERAL DEPARTMENT. Office of the Commissioner in Sind, Government Mouse, Karáchi, 27th August 1908. Forwarded to the Director of Agriculture. 2. The Commissioner regrets that owing to pressure of work the report has been delayed in his office. 3. The report deals mainly with executive matters, and is, on the whole, a satisfactory record of the work performed during the year. General questions relating to stock and breeding are more fully treated in the special reports on the various Horse and Cattle Fairs held in the Province. It is hoped that the institution of a Cattle Fair at Shikárpur will prove successful in directing more careful attention to the breeding of cattle in Upper Sind. The arrangements referred to by the Superintendent for the provision of accommodation for in-patients at Jacobabad will be a useful addition to the local resources of the Department. The Commissioner concurs in the Superintendent's remarks on the reorganization of the Department in Sind. 4. The Commissioner endorses the Superintendent's commendation of the work of Messrs. Haji and Asudamal. He has also much pleasure in acknow- ledging the energy and interest devoted by Major Trydell to the Sind portion of his charg. J. CRERAR, for Commissioner in Sind. To The Director of Agriculture, Poona. OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR, OF AGRICULTURE, BOMBAY, POONA. No. A.Annual Reports. Annual Administration Reports of the Bombay Veterinary College and the Civil Veterinary Department, including the Annual Report of the Glanders and Farcy Department in Bombay for the year 1907-08. No. 12085. REVENUE DEPARTMENT. Bombay Castle, 26th November 1908. Letter from the Principal, Bombay Veterinary College, No. 134-l., dated 4th June 19082 has still been considerable. Inoculation is admittedly the one means of checking it, and a number of Veterinary Graduates were deputed to Bareilly to receive instruction in the scientific use of this preventive. Possibly as a result of this measure, the inoculations actually performed would appear to have been more successful than in the preceding year. At the same time, Govern- ment notice with regret that there is a decrease in the total number of cattle so treated, no explanation of which is offered by either the Superintendent or the Director of Agriculture. In the review of last year's report, the former officer was specially requested to comment upon the assistance rendered by the district officers to the graduates in this matter. In the absence of such information, it is difficult to form an opinion of the quarter in which the responsibility lies for the absence of progress in popularising inoculation for rinderpest, and Government must insist on full information being regularly given in future. 7. There has been, on the whole, a rise in the number of cattle treated in Veterinary Hospitals during the year which is the more satisfactory, in view of the decrease in the virulence of epidemics. The figures for Ratnágiri are particularly good. It is, of course, impossible to measure progress entirely by the number of cases treated, regardless of the prevalence of diseases in the neighbourhood concerned ; but figures so low as those of Godhra and Thána cannot be considered satisfactory. The numbers are low, also in Sholápur, where the dispensary has been only recently established, An increase may be looked for in future years. It is significant that in all three of these hospitals no fees are charged, and Government consider that it should be possible to find means of making them more popular with cattle-owners. There is no apparent improvement in the activity of the Poona District Dispensary, to which reference was made last year ; the report then called for has not yet been received and should be submitted without further delay. 8. In Sind there has been a marked extension of the operations of the Department. It is regrettable that an outbreak of rinderpest has occurred in the Province, but the effects of inoculation seem to have been excellent, and it is hoped that every effort will be made to popularise it. The Governor in Council has read with considerable interest Major Trydell's account of the care exercised in respect of cattle-breeding by cattle-owners in the Karachi District. With such an example ready to hand, it should be possible by degrees to introduce better methods in other parts of Sind. The importance of maintain- ing a pure breed of cattle cannot be over-estimated, and Government are glad to note that the subject is receiving due attention, both in the Presidency proper and in Sind. 9. Major Trydell's proposals for the organisation of the Veterinary Department in Sind will be awaited. 10. The report of the Glanders and Farcy Department in Bombay is a record of useful work satisfactorily performed. J. E. C. JUKES, Under Secretary to Government.

ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE BOMBAY VETERINARY COLLEGE AND CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT IN THE BOMBAY PRESIDENCY INCLUDING SIND FOR THE OFFICIAL YEAR 1908-1909.
No. 664 of 1909. Bombay Veterinary College : Parel, 22nd June 1909. From M. H. SOWERBY, Esq., I. C. V. D., Acting Principal, Bombay Veterinary College ; To The DIRECTOR of PUBLIC INSTRUCTION, Poona. SIR I have the honour to submit this the twenty-third Annual Report of the Bombay Veterinary College dealing with its administration during the official year 1908-1909. During this year up to the 3th May the charge of the College was held by Major Joslen, the permanent Principal. Mr. Dhakmarwala took it over temporarily from him on the 9th idem and was relieved of it by me on my return from vacation leave on the 1st July, when Mr. Ware relieved me of the appointment of Assistant Principal. A brief outline of the duties performed in connection with the Bai Sakerbai Dinshaw Petit Hospital for Animals for the year ending 31st December 1908 is embodied in the report. PROFESSIONAL EXAMINATIONS. 2. The following Officers conducted the Professional Examinations :2 Board of Examiners for this College. The Board consists of the Inspector- General, the Superintendent, Government Cattle Farm, Hissar, and the Super- intendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency. A permanent allotment of subjects to each Member of the Board has also been made and the date of the commencement of the Examinations changed from 1st Monday in December to last Monday in November. INFORMATION RELATING TO STUDENTS. 3. At the beginning of the year there were 107 students on the College rolls (vide Appendix B). During this year there were 38 entries as against 41 and 49 in 1907-1908 and 1906-1907, respectively. Thirty-two students joined Class A. Two students joined Class B under concession (vide rule 17 of the College Rules and Regulations). Three students who failed at the Second Pro- fessional Examination in previous years rejoined Class B and one student joined Class C under concession (vide rule 18). Thirty-nine students left the College, viz., 12 passed the Diploma Examination and 5 left Class C after having failed at the same examination, Four left Class B and 18 left Class A. Two of the students who left Class B joined the Madras Veterinary College, one before the examination in November and one after passing the examin- ation, and two left the Class after having failed at the Examination. Out of 18 who left Class A one died, 8 left after having failed at the examination, 2 because they were not allowed to go up for the examination on account of not putting in the required number of lectures, and 4 on having failed to obtain a scholarship at the Competitive Examination held in March 1908. The number of students attending the College at the close of the official year was 106 as compared to 107 and 111 in 1907-1908 and 1906-1907, respectively. Four students who failed in the Diploma Examination held in December 1907 re-entered the College in July 1908 and one student joined Class C under concession (by rule 19) in July 1908. Under clause 1, Rule 27, one student of Class C who failed in the Diploma Examination in December 1907 reappeared for that examination in December 1908 without rejoining the College. These six students were not on the College rolls either at the beginning or at the end of the official year 1908-1909. They appeared for examination in December 1908 and are shown in Appendix A but not in Appendix B. Of the 106 students on the College rolls at the end of the year, one each belonged to Bengal, Ceylon, Vankanir, Gondal, Kolhápur, Junágadh and Nágpur, two each to Indore, Madras, Goa and Sángli, four to Bhávnagar, ten to Travancore, and 30 to Mysore. The remaining 47 belonged to the town of Bombay and the several Districts of the Presidency proper. The number of men who presented themselves in January 1908 as can- didates for admission as students was 53 as against 73 and 83 in 1907-1908 and 1906-1907, respectively. Of these new men, 35 joined, as previously stated. Of the 32 men who joined Class A, 9 are Matriculates or School Final men. Of the 18 men who did not join, 3 were Matriculates or School Final men, 7 failed at the Entrance Examination and 8 did not join although they passed. Of the 35 students who joined the College, 16 belong to the Bombay Presidency, 6 each to Mysore and Travancore, one each to Nágpur, Madras and Indore, and 4 to Native States in the Bombay Presidency. In the new admissions there are three Native State scholarship holders3 and the selection was made in March from amongst the students who joined in January. This system has been changed and a new one adopted. According to this new system, out of the total number of 21 scholarships 12 are placed at the disposal of the Director of Agriculture for selection and 9 at the disposal of the Principal. The Director will annually select men to fill up the vacancies on the list of these 12 scholars and the men selected will enter as scholars in January. The Principal will also annually select men for the vacancies on the list of 9 scholars in March from among other students who entered the College in January. In selecting his scholars, the Director will consult such District Officers as take an interest in the matter and every effort will be made by him to make the choice a matter of real individual selection. As stated in the last Annual Report, there were 16 men on the Govern- ment scholarship list at the close of the year 1907-1908. Of these 16 men, one died, two left on having passed the Diploma Examination in December last and two on having failed at the first Professional Examination, thus leaving 11 scholarship-holders and 10 vacancies on the list in January 1909. According to the new system, out of these vacancies 6 were allotted to the Director of Agriculture for the selection of candidates and 4 were left to the Principal. Four of the vacancies were filled up by men selected by the Director of Agriculture from the applicants to him and 2 by students who had already joined the College with a view to compete at the scholarship examination to be held by the Principal in March. Two men only competed at this examina- tion and only one of them was selected, the other being rejected because he was a resident of a Native State and not one of the Districts of this Presidency. Thus three scholarships were left vacant, the number of men on the Govern- ment scholarship list at the end of the official year being 18. The new system was only recently sanctioned and, I believe, did not receive wide publicity although the vacancies on the list of scholars and the system of awarding them were advertised in the newspapers together with the opening of the College course. I, however, trust that it will be sufficiently known to people to attract the proper class of men to compete for the vacant sholarships next year. BAI SAKERBAI DINSHAW PETIT HOSPITAL FOR ANIMALS. 5. The records of the Bai Sakerbai Dinshaw Petit Hospital for Animals give the following information relative to the patients admitted :4 one has obtained employment in the Madras Presidency, four have been employed by the Mysore State and one by the Kolhapur State (all the latter five having been State Scholars); two have been practising privately, one, a Bengali, is likely to obtain an appointment in Eastern Bengal, one is employed in a firm of Veterinary Surgeons, and five remain unemployed. Four Graduates of 1907 were employed in the Subordinate Civil Veterinary Department of the Bombay Presidency. One Graduate of 1903 and two Graduates of 1907 obtained appointments as Veterinary Inspectors in the Nizam's Dominions on a salary of Halli Sicca Rs. 1005 SANITARY SURVEYORS' CLASS. 10. Five Graduates were admitted to the Sanitary Surveyors' Class in January 1909, Three of the Graduates who were admitted to the class in January 1908 attended the class up to the end and passed the Sanitary Survey- ors' Examination in July 1908, one gaining a scholarship. HOSPITAL IMPROVEMENTS. 11. Mr. Framji Bomanji Jeejibhoy having given a donation of Rs. 3,000 for a Colic loose Box at the Hospital, the work of building the box is in hand. The Hospital authorities have through the agency of the Public Works Department built a new road in their compound adjoining the road of the new Veterinary College at the opening in the divisional wall. The question of building the Operating Theatre is still pending and has been referred to Government at the special request of the Secretary of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, who wishes that fresh plan and estimates for the building should be drawn by the Executive Engineer, Presidency, and that the building work should be carried out under the super- vision of that Officer. THE NEW COLLEGE. 12. On its completion the possession of the new building of the College was taken over from the Public Works Department and the building was formally opened by the Honourable, Mr. J. L. Jenkins, C. S. I., in the presence of a gathering of Graduates, students and teachers and the general public. Before declaring the building formally opened he addressed the assembly. His speech was very encouraging. The following is an extract from his speech :6 EXCURSION. 14. Students of Class "C" were taken on an excursion tour to the Pro- vince of Mysore by Mr. Shaikh, Assistant Professor of Anatomy, and to the Bándra Slaughter House by Mr. Ware, Assistant Principal. EQUITATION. 15. Eighteen students of Class "C" went through a course of Equitation at the Government Body-Guard Menage at Chaupati. The grant sanctioned allowed payment of fees for this number of students only. STUDENTS' QUARTERS. 16. At the beginning of the year the rent for students was reduced to Rs. 2 per student, and the number of students residing in the quarters rose to 65 at the end of the year. Government has, however, decided that in the case of students who are not residents of the Bombay Presidency, the rent should be increased to Rs. 3 from April 1909. It has been proposed to provide two Tennis Courts for students at a cost of Rs. 600 on the piece of ground in front of their quarters. The question of appointing a private practitioner as Medical attendant for resident students is under the consideration of Government. NEEDS ON TRANSFER OF THE COLLEGE TO THE NEW BUILDING. 17. (1). Fittings for the first floor of the Patho-Bacteriological Laboratory as a Patho-Histological Class-room. (2) Suitable new specimen jars, etc., for the Museum. (3) Additional furniture for different offices. (4) New benches for class-rooms, the old ones being broken and unsuitable. (5) Cleaning and laying out the new compound. Government has been requested to sanction a special grant of Rs. 2,000 for expenditure during 1909-10 on such requirements as may be considered most urgent. Proposals have also been submitted to level the ground and repair the walls of the new compound and put up gas-lamps and water-taps there. NATIVE PROFESSORS' QUARTERS. 18. Further alterations to the quarters of the Native Professors at a cost of Rs. 1,825 have been proposed and plans and estimates on this account have been approved. 19. Appendix D is the financial statement of the College and Appendix E is the statement showing the main results. PATHO-BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY. 20. During the year this has been in very constant use for cases in the Hospital and in connection with the Glanders and Farcy Department. It has also been utilised as the Bacteriological Laboratory for the Civil Veterinary Department in the Bombay Presidency and numbers of specimens have been submitted for diagnosis by Graduates in charge of the different Veterinary dispensaries. It is anticipated that when the Civil Veterinary Department in this Presidency is reorganised many more specimens will be forwarded and work in the Laboratory will be considerably developed. The question of building a new Bacteriological Laboratory on the new College premises is still under consideration of Government. MUSEUM. 21. Twenty-six museum specimens were received during the year, mostly from Graduates in charge of Local Board Veterinary Dispensaries. The speci- mens consisted of diseased limbs, abnormalities, biting flies and photographs of typical diseases of animals.
7 Many pathological specimens which had undergone decomposition were replaced by new specimens from the Hospital. 22. The Teaching Staff have performed their duties satisfactorily. Mr. Dhakmarwala has been very prompt and painstaking in the performance of any extra work he has been called upon to do and Mr. Shaik has been very zealous in connection with his extra duty in the Museum. 23. On the death of Mr. Ranade, the Second Clerk, Mr. Palnitker, who was acting for him, was confirmed in the place. He promises to be a good clerk. Mr. Phatak, the Head Clerk, has shown much zeal and performed his duties quite satisfactorily. 24. I wish to thank Mr. Doctor, the Secretary of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, for his cordial co-operation and the great assistance he gives by promptly carrying out any suggestions made in connec- tion with the Hospital. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, M. H. SOWERBY, I. C. V. D., Acting Principal, Bombay Veterinary College.

13 No. 4217 or 1909-10. Poona, Office of the Director of Public Instruction, 12th July 1909. From THE HONOURABLE MR. W. H. SHARP, M.A., Director of Public Instruction, Poona; To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Educational Department, Bombay. Sir, I have the honour to forward the report of the Veterinary College, Parel, for the year 1908-09, together with the remarks of the Director of Agriculture thereon. 2. In the course of the year the new buildings of the College were formally opened, a permanent Board of Examiners was constituted, a new system of selecting scholars was introduced, and improvements were carried out in the College library. 3. The results of the year's work are satisfactory. The College continues to be attended by men from all over India, and the majority of its graduates seem to find employment without much difficulty. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, W. H. SHARP, Director of Public Instruction. B 30914 No. 4436-A. OF 1909. From G. P. KEATINGE, ESQUIRE, I.C.S., Director of Agriculture, Bombay, Poona; To THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION, BOMBAY, Poona. Poona, 6th July 1909. Sir, With reference to para. 2 of Government Resolution No. 2286, dated 8th December 1906, E. D., I have the honour to communicate the following remarks on the Annual Report of the Bombay Veterinary College for 1908-09, a proof copy of which was received direct from the Government Central Press, Bombay. 2. The results of the examination are satisfactory. 3. The number of students who come from the Bombay Presidency is considerably less than half. Of the 35 students who joined the College during the year under report only 16 belonged to this Presidency, and of these 7 were scholars. 4. It is to country boys that we would naturally look to fill the College; but the life in Bombay is not very popular with such. I anticipate no difficulty, however, next year in filling the vacancies amongst the scholars with suitable students drawn from the classes connected with the land. 5. The course at the College is somewhat advanced and elaborate for the class of students which we obtain and for the requirements of the rural parts. have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, G. P. KEATINGE, Director of Agriculture.
15 No. 163 L. of 1909. BOMBAY VETERINARY COLLEGE : Parel, 22nd June 1909. From M. H. SOWEBBY, ESQ., I. C. V. D., Acting Principal, Bombay veterinary college; To The SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. SIR, I have the honour to submit the Annual Report of the Glanders and Farcy Department in Bombay for the year 1908-1909. During this year up to the 8th May the charge of this Department was held by Major Joslen. Mr. Dhakmarwala took it over temporarily from him on the 9th idem and was relieved of it by me on the 1st July. 2. During this year 128 horses were admitted into the Government Lazaretto at Sewree as against 142 and 197 in 1907-08 and 1906-07, respect- ively. Out of the admissions there were two confirmed cases of Glanders, 71 confirmed cases of Surra, 40 suspicious cases, and 15 Contacts. Out of 40 suspicious cases 21 reacted to Mallein and were destroyed, two were found to be suffering from Epizootic Lymphangitis, 2 died free from diseases scheduled under the Act, and 15 were returned to their owners. Out of the 15 Contacts, 4 reacted to the Mallein test and were destroyed, one proved to be suffering from Surra and was also destroyed, and 10 were returned to their owners as they were found to be free from disease. The total number of horses destroyed for Glanders during this year was 27 as against 29 and 41 in 1907-08 and 1906-07, respectively. Two horses suffer- ing from Epizootic Lymphangitis were destroyed as against 1 and 2 in 1907-08 and 1906-07, respectively. Seventy-two horses suffering from Surra were destroyed as against 73 and 144 in 1907-08 and 1906-07, respectively. Of the 27 horses destroyed for Glanders, 17 belonged to Arab dealers, 2 to Persian dealers, 4 to private individuals, 3 to owners of carriages plying for hire, and 1 was ownerless. Of the 2 horses destroyed for Epizootic Lymphan- gitis 1 belonged to a private individual and 1 to an Arab dealer. Of the 72 horses destroyed for Surra 48 belonged to owners of carriages plying for hire, 22 to private individuals and 2 to the Bombay Mounted Police. Out of the total number of 128 horses admitted into the Lazaretto 58 belonged to owners of carriages plying for hire, 38 to private individuals, 27 to Arab dealers, 2 to Persian dealers, 2 to the Bombay Mounted Police, and 1 was ownerless. The different classes of horses admitted into the Sewree Lazaretto this year were as follows :16 The Australian imports were 1,946 horses and 348 ponies as against 2,516 horses and 340 ponies and 2,347 horses and 300 ponies in 1907-08 and 1906-07, respectively. The Arab imports were 1,493 horses and 474 ponies as against 2,160 horses and 343 ponies and 2,274 horses and 242 ponies in 1907-08 and 1906-07, respect- ively. The Persian imports were 112 horses as against 236 horses in 1907-08 and 289 horses and 65 ponies in 1906-07. This year 31 American and 3 Arab donkeys and 148 Persian and 1 Arab mules were imported. Of the total above mentioned imports 14 horses were sent to the Sewree Lazaretto from the Harbour, 9 as suspicious and 5 as Contacts. Out of these 4 reacted to Mallein and were destroyed for Glanders and 10 were returned to their owners. Besides these 6 Arab horses were tested in the dealers' stables, 2 out of which reacted to Mallein and were removed to the Sewree Lazaretto and destroyed for Glanders. 4. There were six consignments of horses from Queensland. 5. Owing to Epizootic Lymphangitis and Surra having been scheduled under the Glanders and Farcy Act, the number of horses standing at the Lazaretto has increased and the present accommodation is insufficient for this increased number. I, therefore, intend to submit a proposal to Government for building new stalls. 6. South African Horse Sickness has this year been scheduled under the Glanders and Farcy Act. 7. Mr. Dubash whose services were lent to the Zanzibar Government reverted to his appointment as Chief Veterinary Inspector on 1st March 1909. Veterinary Inspector P. DeSouza was deputed to Aden for special duty in connection with South African Horse Sickness from 7th November 1908 to 26th January 1909. Veterinary Graduate P. Gracias was appointed to act during his absence. For the eleven months of the year under report during which Mr. Miranda acted as Chief Veterinary Inspector he performed his duties to my entire satisfaction. Owing to the scheduling of Epizootic Lymphangitis and Surra under the Glanders and Farcy Act, the work of the Department has considerably increased and the scale of pay of the Inspecting Staff and the Clerk attached to the Department has been revised and so arranged as to suit the present circumstances. The revised scale comes into force with effect from the 1st April 1909. 8. Appendix II is the Financial Statement for the year under report. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, M. H. SOWERBY, I. C. V. D., Acting Principal, Bombay Veterinary College.

19 No. 1374 of 1909. From K. HEWLETT, ESQ., I.C.V.D., Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency ; To The UNDER SECRETARY To GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. Poona, 26th June 1909. SIR, I have the honour to submit for the consideration of His Excellency the Governor in Council the Annual Administration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, for the official year 1908-09. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, K. HEWLETT, Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency. THROUGH THE DIRECTOR OF AGRICULTURE, BOMBAY, Poona.
21 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT IN THE BOMBAY PRESIDENCY FOR THE YEAR 1908-09. During the year under report the following officers held charge as Superin- tendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency:22 Influenza.23 immunised, but owing to the ignorance and objections of the people a large majority of animals in the locality are not immunised and so the disease persists. The alternative of turning partially immunised animals in among diseased so as to allow of them getting a mild attack is never adopted by the people. 12. In order to attempt to overcome the people's ignorance of and preju- dice against inoculation pamphlets on the methods of using rinderpest serum and the rational procedure to adopt in combating the disease have been prepared. It is hoped that by distributing this pamphlet and others dealing with conta- gious diseases (which have also recently been prepared or revised), something may be done to spread correct knowledge of the disease and to induce the people to avail themselves of the benefits of inoculations; but a considerable time must elapse before the value of co-operation in this direction is fully realised, and it is very doubtful if it will ever be possible to really thoroughly control and eradicate a disease such as rinderpest by voluntary co-operation and without legislative measures, as has been proved time and again in European and other countries. Notwithstanding this there is no doubt that with systematic and continuous endeavour something can be done to lessen the mortality and efforts should not be relaxed. 13. The number of anti-rinderpest inoculations in 39 outbreaks performed during the year amount to 4,736 as against 26,558 last year and 39,992 in 1906-07. The outbreaks in former years were calculated as 1 only as the disease invaded the Presidency and swept over it and the various villages affected were but the extension of a single outbreak. This diminution in the numbers of inoculations performed is chiefly due to rinderpest being less prevalent and to the fact that these inoculations can only be performed in case of the actual occurrence of the disease. It is also to some extent due to the continued opposition to the process on the part of the people as well as to the lack of system and continuous endeavour in dealing with outbreaks on the part of the District Local Board Veterinary Assistants. The District Officers have afforded assistance and in some cases a few animals have been inoculated by the exercise of their influence. But in the majority of cases the success or otherwise of the inoculator's endeavours depend almost entirely on his own personality. If the people know and trust the Veterinary Assistant he can do more by persuasion than by calling on the Revenue Officers for assistance. It should be possible in future for Veterinary Assistants to attend many more outbreaks of disease and this part of their duties will be given more prominence in future. 14. The following table shows the number of outbreaks of rinderpest attended and the numbers of inoculations performed by each Veterinary Assistant:24 Besides the above number 2,273 inoculations were performed by the Military Department at Poona and Aden from serum supplied by the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department. 15. No inoculations against Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia were performed as the issue of serum for this disease has been discontinued. The use of anti- anthrax serum has also been restricted. Black Quarter inoculation has not been attempted, as the method requires the use of a double vaccine, and although generally speaking is attended with only slight mortality as a result of vaccination, is on occasions in certain outbreaks attended with a high mortality. The Superintendent therefore considers it unwise at the present stage of development to run the risk of a serious percentage of mortality from vaccina- tion and so discredit the work of the Department in the eyes of the ryots. Investigation and Research. 16. During the year under report pathological material has been submit- ted to the Laboratory at the Bombay Veterinary College for examination by the following Veterinary Assistants:25 20. Dhulia Dispensary.26 for 3 months. He performed 8 post-mortem examinations. The dispensary has continued to do good work and Mr. Reuben has worked well and is a capable man. The dispensary was inspected on 9th November 1908. The cattle population within a radius of 5 miles is 14,189 ; the number of cattle treated is 3,189, giving a percentage of 22.47. Fees are levied. 25. Násik Itinerating Dispensary.27 SO. Poona City Dispensary.28 Assistant was on tour for 90 days. He visited 20 outbreaks of contagious disease. He treated 326 cases on tour. He visited cattle markets at Nándgad, Khánápur, Bagewái, Bail Hongal and Belgaum. He treated Municipal, Cantonment and Dairy Farm Cattle, horses belonging to the Mounted Police and cattle at the vaccine department. He occasionally visited the slaughter-house. The dispensary has been well managed during the year and Veterinary Assistant Sadekar has performed his duties satisfactorily. The dispensary was inspected on 22nd February 1909. The cattle population within a radius of 5 miles is 6,442, the cattle treated number 1,230, giving a percentage of 19.09. Fees are levied. 36. Chikodi Dispensary.29 the Cattle Pairs at Rattihalli, Devargudda and Dhárwár Cattle Show. Not much progress has been made. The dispensary was inspected on 24th February 1909. 40. Kánara (Sirsi) Dispensary.30 45. Thána Dispensary31 The Veterinary Assistant was on tour for 21 days ; he visited 13 villages for outbreaks of contagious disease and treated 196 cases. He treated Munici- pal and Police animals, inspected tonga ponies, wrote leaflets, lectured at the Nadiád Agricultural Show, was in charge of the Government stallion at Nadiád, inspected the stallion at Kaira, and attended the Ahmedabad Horse and Cattle show. He performed 3 post-mortem examinations. The dispensary has been well managed and is progressing in popularity and usefulness yearly. Mr. Maniar is a capable man. The dispensary was inspected on 27th October 1908 The cattle population within a radius of 5 miles is 13,801 ; the cattle treated number 4,900, giving a percentage of 35.50. Treatment is free. 50. Kaira (Anand) Itinerating Dispensary.32 for the herds of Gujarat and also to keep a pure strain of Kankreji cattle which will form a nucleus from which breeders can start herds of pure bred stock, the old Gujarát breed having suffered to a considerable extent during recent years both from a dearth of good bulls and the introduction of inferior breeds of cows. At the commencement of the year under report the herd consisted of 5 stock hulls, 140 cows, 82 heifers, 24 heifer calves, 13 two year old bulls, 17 yearling bulls, and 12 castrated stock. At the close of the year it consisted of 5 stock bulls, 154 cows, 72 heifers, 30 heifer calves, 6 three-year old bulls, ten two-year old bulls, 18 yearling bulls, and 22 bull calves, besides which there were 11 bullocks and 2 two-year-old bullocks. During the year 7 excellent young stock bulls were sold, of which two were sold to the Government Cattle Farm, Hissar, and five to the Kaira District Local Board. Besides the above 10 cows, 13 heifers, and 23 yearling bullocks were sold. During the year 47 bull calves- and 48 heifer calves were dropped. The farm as a bull breeding one is just beginning to get into thorough working order and in future years a steady and increasing supply of stock bulls will be available for issue but at present the demand is greater than the supply. Veterinary Assistant P. V. Nagarshet held charge as Manager during the year with the exception of 43 days during which time he was deputed to Bareilly to undergo a course of training in rinderpest inoculation and at the termination of that course to visit the Government Cattle Farm, Hissar. During his absence Mr. Buxy held charge. Mr. Nagar- shet's work has been satisfactory. (2).33 an average of 34.60 last year. The average per stallion in Gujarát is 49.32, whereas in the Deccan it only amounts to 2087. The full complement of mares per stallion should be 50 and the figures for the Deccan are far from satisfactory. 59. The maintenance of the stallions is charged in equal proportions to Government and to the District Local Board in whose jurisdiction they stand. The cost of transit from stand to stand is charged to Government, and the cost of repairs to stabling, &c., is regarded as a maintenance charge. The cost of feed, keep and transit is shown in Table XII and the average cost for the last two years is shown below :34 tural Associations. These shows were organised by the Associations, and held at Dhárwár, Panvel, Shrigonda. The Ahmednagar and Ahmedabad Cattle Shows were also revived. 65. Cattle shows unless held annually and in connection with some definite scheme for cattle breeding do not do very much good as the interest aroused is only passing and does not lead to any improvement in the live stock. 66. The following is a brief review of the various Shows :35 (7) The Ahmedabad Show.36 such expenditure in the annual reports of the institutions concerned and the Accountant General has accordingly omitted the following items from the statement for the year under report:37 TABLE II.

Below letter No. 1374, dated 26th June 1909, from the Superintendent, C. V. D., to the Under Secretary to Government, R. D., Bombay. No. A/5190 OF 1909. Poona, 3rd August 1909. Forwarded with compliments. 2. The work of the Department falls naturally into three divisions in connection with (1) Contagious disease. (2) Non-contagious disease. (3) Breeding. 3. As regards contagious disease we still have a mortality of over 8,000 to record, and as stated by the Superintendent there can be little doubt that the true number is considerably greater than this. Taking the four most deadly diseases, viz., Rinderpest, Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia, Black Quarter and Anthrax, it must he clearly understood that we have no effective remedy for these. The anti-rinderpest inoculations, as stated in paragraphs 11-13 of the report, have been too few to have any appreciable effect; and it is chiefly the animals of little or no value that have been submitted to inoculation. From the nature of the case I fear that we cannot hope for much success from this source in the near future. Nor can we look to legislative measures such as have been successful in other countries, since it would be impossible to enforce them. At present there are no closed pastures in this country, and the cultivator has no means of saving his cattle from infection from any disease that may be about unless he is prepared to tie them up indefinitely. I do not think that it is looking too far ahead to aim at the creation of effective hedges and fences in suitable localities, which in time of contagious disease would admit of the segregation of the infected from the uninfected. Meantime we are practically helpless. Some 7,000 animals were treated for contagious diseases during the year. Presumably most of these cases were foot and mouth disease, and in the remainder some alleviation was attempted in the case of the more deadly diseases. 4. The treatment of non-contagious disease at the 32 dispensaries comprises by far the greater part of the work of the Department. 56,000 animals were treated during the year as against 43,000 the year before, and steady progress is being made in this direction. The work done at Nadiád, Násik, Ahmedabad and Ratnágiri is distinctly satisfactory, while the improvement at the Poona City dispensary is marked and very creditable to Mr. Marathe. The figures given for " average daily attendance " are evidently calculated by different methods at different dispensaries; but they indicate that in some cases the dispensary staff do a fair day's work. In other cases this is obviously not so. Dispensaries have naturally been located in towns of some size, mostly at the District head-quarters; and the popularity which they are gaining is mainly amongst the urban population. I am far from saying that this is no use, but I venture to call attention to the fact because in the new scheme for the expansion of the Veterinary Department it is proposed to introduce widely to rural areas the system of dispensaries which has gained some popularity in the towns. It appears to me, however, that the circumstances of the two cases require consideration. The diseases treated at these dispensaries are by far the greater part of a comparatively simple nature, such as wounds, sores, sprains, skin disease, external parasites and tympanitis; such diseases in fact as a moderately skilled farmer in England would as a matter of course treat himself. It is not to be expected that townspeople will have much knowledge of the treatment of animals, and they will naturally be glad to avail themselves of the dispensary round the corner. But are we to make the same assumption about country people and, if so, are we to assume that the cultivator will march his cow off 10 miles to the nearest Veterinary hospital whenever she has a sore on her back or a pain in her stomach ? It must be remembered that even at present in many of the cases entered the animal has never been to the hospital at all, but a countryman from a distant village has come in and said that he has a dozen animals affected with tics or
52 with foot and mouth disease and the Veterinary Officer then gives him a bottle of medicine for his dozen animals and enters 12 cases treated. I think that this gives some indication as to the lines on which development should proceed. In paragraph 19 of his report Mr. Hewlett rightly says that dispensaries are a centre from which a correct knowledge of the care and rational treatment of live stock can be spread; but I am doubtful whether this object is fully obtained by giving a cultivator a bottle of unknown medicine with an unintelligible name. In my opinion the main function of a rural dispensary ought to be to diffuse amongst the people a correct knowledge of Veterinary hygiene, and the treat- ment of animals in sickness and health. It should give short courses of free instruction to all who can be got to attend them, and should lose no opportunity of propaganda by means of lectures, demonstrations and the distribution of leaflets. Only such medicines should be recommended as are procurable by the people; and in cases where it is essential to recommend some medicine not ordinarily procurable by the cultivator adequate steps should be taken to provide for the supply of the medicine. At one or two agricultural shows lectures were given regarding the treatment of particular cattle ailments, and a distribution of leaflets on the subject was made. The cultivators listened attentively and eagerly took the leaflets; and I may mention that I was several times asked if I had no leaflets dealing with human diseases, such as guinea-worm. In connection with the cost of these dispensaries I may remark that the figure shown in table V represents the cost of the fixed dispensaries, the figure in table VI the cost of fixed and itinerating dispensaries, and the figure in table XIV-A (which was supplied by the Accountant General) apparently represents somothing different, but what that is I am unable to say. 5. To turn to the subject of cattle breeding, the energies of the Department have been confined to breeding bulls at the Chharodi Farm and assisting in the purchase of bulls for the cultivators of the Ahmednagar district. The supply of good bulls is no doubt a matter of importance, and in a country like England where closed pastures are the ordinary rule and where adequate feeding of young stock and cows is recognised to be essential, it is a matter of very great importance. There are some favoured tracts in this Presidency where a fair grass supply is practically a certainty, and the cattle come off relatively well; but in most parts the best that the cows and calves can hope for is to regain some condition in the cold weather after a severe period of starvation in the hot weather and a gorge of green grass in the rains which produces indigestion, scouring and tympanitis, while in years of short rainfall many are starved outright. This constitutes a pretty heavy discount on the benefits conferred by the good bull; and I am somewhat doubtful as to the exact value of his services where starvation or semi-starvation is the order of the day. I should be inclined to say that the question of adequate fodder is the crux of the situa- tion; and that the locality in which to encourage careful breeding is that where there is habitually a surplus of kadbi, after providing for the requirements of the plough bullocks. The provision and economical use of kadbi and other feeding material is of the utmost importance. Where you can show that a supply of fodder is assured and that you have 50 fair cows with a fence round them to keep off outside bulls and animals suffering from contagious disease the provision of a good stud bull will no doubt be of much value. It costs more in the first instance to feed animals than to leave them unfed; but the net profit is greater in the long run and continuous progress is possible. The subject is no doubt one of agricultural rather than Veterinary interest; but so is the whole question of cattle breeding and it is mainly as a matter of convenience that the Civil Veterinary Department undertakes this work. The question of starting a bull breeding farm in the Deccan has been under consideration during the past year; and there is a suitable site available near Sholápur; but I have purposely refrained from making any definite proposals in this matter until I could see my way a bit clearer. 6. In conclusion, I would request that Government will indicate whether they approve of the ideas put forward above so that the lines of development may be made clear. Personally I should like to see a much closer connection established between the Civil Veterinary Department and the Agricultural Department. G. F. KEATINGE, Director of Agriculture.
53 No. 29-54-C. Karáchi, 26th June 1909. From MAJOR A. S. TRYDELL, I. C. V. D., Superintendent, Indian Civil Veterinary Department, Sind, Baluchistan and Rajputána ; To THE UNDER SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. (Through the Commissioner in Sind, Karáchi.) Sir, I have the honour to submit for the consideration of His Excellency the Governor in Council the Annual Administration Report of the Indian Civil Veterinary Department in Sind for the official year 1908-1909. GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. 2. I held charge of the office of Superintendent, Indian Civil Veterinary Department, Sind, Baluchistan and Rájputána, throughout the year under report. 3. I toured through the districts of Upper Sind Frontier, Lárkhána and Sukkur, and inspected all the Veterinary Dispensaries in the Province. I also attended the Jacobabad, Shikárpur (Sukkur District) and Talhar (Hyderabad District) cattle shows. I travelled 4,902 miles by rail and 508 by road against 2,878 and 339 respectively travelled last year. I.54 also an outbreak in the district, and Table II shows 1,734 head of cattle in all succumbed to it, 70 in the town and 1,664 in the district, against 8 deaths reported last year in the town. The outbreak in the town was not no serious as one frequently finds it in many other places, and the reason for this is that the cattle seem to be excep- tionally immune. Out of the cases I examined, several presented marked clinical symptoms55 (2) Other diseases. 7. As shown in Table II there were 2 deaths amongst equines and 9 amongst bovines from other contagious diseases against 1 and 28 deaths respect- ively reported last year. Besides these (vide Table IV), the Veterinary Assistants while on tour treated 2,434 cases, of which 412 were contagious and 2,021 non- contagious, and 1 castration was performed as compared to 2,457, of which 323 were contagious, 2,123 non-contagious and 11 castration cases treated last year. The total number of cases treated by Veterinary Assistants as in and out- door patients at their dispensaries (vide Table V) was 13,230 as compared with 11,846 cases treated last year. This gives a total of 15,664 cases treated during the year against 14,303 cases treated last year. (3) Veterinary Hospitals and Dispensaries. 8. There are 6 Veterinary Dispensaries open during the year, viz., the same number as the previous year. The construction of a new building for Veterinary Dispensary and hospital at Lárkhána was completed during the year. A hospital and dispensary at Halla was also completed but was not opened as no Veterinary Assistant was forthcoming on the terms offered. The site for building a dispensary at Sukkur was selected and the work taken in hand but it has been postponed pending the settlement of negotiations with the Military Authorities regarding the revision of the Military zone. Karáchi Veterinary Dispensary.56 Of the total of 2,321 cases treated at the dispensary 566 were equines, 831 bovines and 924 others against 692, 746 and 694 respectively last year. The Veterinary Graduate attended cattle shows and fairs at Talhar, and Uderolal. He was also entrusted with the duty of looking after Municipal bullocks during the year at a remuneration of Rs. 35 per month. The amount reported under the head receipts is Rs. 5,142-9-4 and under that of expenditure Rs. 3,992-13-0, which leaves a balance of Rs. 1,149-12-4 at the close of the year (vide Table VI). The salutri attached to this dispensary while on tour treated 515 cases against 527 treated last year. The decrease in the number of cases treated has been attributed to a change in the system of touring introduced during the year under report. Endeavours should be made to see that the Veterinary Graduate and salutri are never both absent on tour at the same time. At an inspection I made on one occasion I found the pattewallah in charge of the hospital and attending the patients. The cattle population within a radius of 5 miles of the dispensary is 6,700 and the number of cattle treated at it 831, giving a percentage of 12.40 against 11.83 last year. Fees are charged at this dispensary. Nausháhro Dispensary.57 of 2,194 treated last year58 IV.59 recognise his responsibilities for watching the health of the stock of the district and has failed to report the great mortality that was taking place at a certain village he visits monthly, amongst all kind of stock. If he is aware of the mortality he failed in his duty in not reporting it; if he was not aware, his failure to be in touch with the zemindars is still more reprehensible. This is the very sort of information I require. Mr. Ansari (Nausháhro). His report shows he has treated more horses at his hospital than all the other animals put together, which is somewhat remarkable as Nausháhro is right out in the district. Unfortunately I did not tour in his disrict so I am not able to form a proper opinion of his capabilities, but he strikes me as quick and his dispensary is neat. Mr. Wadhwani (Jacobabad) works at a disadvantage. He has a rather delapidated dispensary and uncomfortable quarters. However plans have been passed for the conversion of a part of a centrally situated Civil Court into a good dispensary and in-patient accommodation. His report is poor. He is dis- contented with his lot. Mr. Kapur's report is but one and a half pages of foolscap with a propor- tion of figures. I took him out on tour. He means well but shows little promise. If I have gone to some length in reporting upon these officers it is because there are no records in my office to show that they have been taken much notice of by a professional man hitherto. Messrs. Haji and Asudamal stand out from the others, whilst I think Mr. Ansari will earn some sort of reputation in time; he is in a sense at a disadvantage as his dispensary is out in the country away from the railway. Consequently he is out of near touch with the head-quarter officials in the district so has little chance of showing them what he can do. V.60 small hardy bullocks of Sind which are capable of standing extremes of temperature and a rough life are suitable and sufficient in numbers for present requirements. Visits to many villages showed there is growing stock from all ages, whilst there are cows enough to continue their production. Although the condition of the cows leaves much to be desired they apparently manage to perform what is chiefly required of them. 15. It should not be concluded that because serious epidemics occur here and there from time to time that it follows they must be continually ripe all over Sind. I do not accept statements that diseases are serious unless it is reported by some responsible people who have actually witnessed them. Each Mukhtiárkar and Tápadár I have met has been requested by me to give earnest attention to the state of cattle, etc., and to bring outbreaks to notice immediately they occur. 16. I am by no means in a position to yet say definitely whether the Province is, generally speaking, a healthy country for animals which one Collector has declared it to be, but as far as my short experience goes and from what I have gathered I am inclined to agree with him. That the country contains every ill the flesh of stock is heir to I am pretty well convinced, but they do not occur to such an extent as to cause shortage; if they do the informa- tion is not forthcoming, nor have complaints been made that I am aware of. (It has been argued that villagers try to hide disease from the authorities hence many outbreaks are never brought to light. Serious epidemics should be difficult to hide.) 17. Three of the Collectors who have been good enough to furnish me with their opinions on the note referred to above are in general agreement with the statements I have made therein; and the weekly season reports continue to show that the state and the health of the cattle are satisfactory. 18. Under the circumstances it does not appear necessary to raise a very strong subordinate Veterinary Department in the Province, so that Mr. Hewlett's carefully and considerately drawn up scheme will answer admir- ably for the present and near future. When it has been established we shall get more exact information on all points which will be a guide to see whether the Department should be added to or otherwise. 19. I think it is essential in order to carry out his scheme that youth should be annually selected from the Province for training at one of the Veterinary Colleges, owing to the difficulty there is to recruit graduates from the Presidency Proper except at abnormal rates of pay. I suggested this many months ago, but as yet they have not been found.* 20. My Head Clerk Ganda Mall Soori has been under me on and off for the past eleven years and as usual with him he has worked hard and possesses the quality of being reliable and accurate. He is a very deserving officer. 21. The usual Tables are herewith enclosed. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, A. S. TRYDELL, I. C. V. D., Major, Superintendent, Indian Civil Veterinary Department, Sind, Baluchistan and Rájputána. * In the meantime Baluchistan has secured three candidates who have gone to the Punjab Veterinary College, and who on qualifying will serve the Government for not less than three years, on a salary commencing at Rs, 30 per month. They have not been attracted by a settled subordinate Department, the starting of which is to be discussed shortly.

REVENUE DEPARTMENT. Bombay Castle, 1st November 1909. Letter from the Principal, Bombay Veterinary College, No. 163-L., dated 22nd June 19092 ground for hope that it will in time prove not impossible to overcome the suspicion with which the more ignorant of the people naturally regard the prophylactic treatment of cattle. It must not be forgotten that appreciable success has been obtained in Northern India. In dealing with the far less fatal, but still most injurious and troublesome complaint of foot and mouth disease, it is reasonable to believe that progress, slow but sure, is being made. It is a disease for the treatment of which people resort readily to the dispensaries, and accept advice from itinerating or visiting Veterinary Assistants in the villages. 7. The treatment of non-contagious diseases in the dispensaries made satisfactory progress. Four new dispensaries were opened during the year and the total number of these institutions at the end of the year was thirty-two. There was also a more than proportionate rise in the recorded number of animals treated. 8. The remarks of the Director of Agriculture that different methods are adopted for calculating the average attendance and number of animals treated at different dispensaries seem to show that instructions are required to secure uniformity of method. The matter will no doubt receive attention. It is true that the work of a dispensary cannot be adequately judged merely by the record of its number of patients, but such a record is not without its uses, and at least affords some indication of the readiness or otherwise of the people to receive help. 9. The recent provincialization of the Department has already had a beneficial effect on its moral and discipline. The comments of the Superintendent show that he has been enabled to appreciate merit and detect slackness and incompetence on the part of his subordinates. 10. The breeding operations at the Northcote Cattle Farm were successfully continued and the keen demand for good bulls is an encouraging feature. 11 Government cannot undertake in a review of the Annual Report to pronounce upon large and new suggestions of policy vitally affecting the constitu- tion and aims of the Department. Any views of the kind which the Director desires to communicate to Government should be submitted separately. Government are fully prepared to consider any matured suggestions which the Director has to make for the improvement of the Department under his supervision, and for the practical adaptation of its services to the requirements of agriculturists. 12. The energy and interest in his work displayed by Mr. Hewlett merit high commendation. 13. In Sind six Veterinary dispensaries were open during the year. In Karachi town and district an epidemic of rinderpest occurred but the mortality though considerable was not excessive. The usual causes operated to prevent the serum treatment being completely successful, but the fact that of nearly fifteen hundred animals inoculated only two succumbed to the disease is note- worthy. Government are glad to be assured by Major Trydell that the agricultural stock of the Province is adequate for its present requirements. 14.

BOMBAY VETERINARY COLLEGE: Parel, 1st June 1910. From M. H. SOWERBY, ESQ., I.C.V.D., Principal, Bombay Veterinary College ; To THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION, Poona. Sir, I have the honour to submit this, the twenty-fourth Annual Report of the Bombay Veterinary College, dealing with its administration during the official year 1909-10. During this year I acted as Principal up to 8th November when the late Lieutenant-Colonel Joslen returned from leave and took charge of the appointment which he held up to 28th February, the date on which he died from the effects of a carriage accident. On his death I took charge of the appointment which I held up to the end of the official year. Prom the begin- ning of the year up to 8th November while I acted as Principal Mr. P. Ware, I.C.V.D., acted as Assistant Principal. On 8th November 1909 when Lieutenant- Colonel Joslen relieved me of the office of Principal I relieved Mr. Ware of the office of Assistant Principal. Since 1st March I have held the sub. pro tem. appointment of Principal, Mr. Dhakmarwala, of Assistant Principal, Mr. Vakha- ria, of Professor of Bovine Pathology, Mr. Phadke, of Assistant Professor of Chemistry and Mr. Pillai, of Curator and Laboratory Assistant. These arrangements are to hold good until Mr. Hewlett takes charge of the office of Principal. A brief outline of the duties performed in connection with the Bai Sakarbai Dinshaw Petit Hospital for animals for the year ending 31st December 1909 is embodied in the report. PROFESSIONAL EXAMINATIONS. 2. The following Officers conducted the Professional Examinations :2 INFORMATION RELATING TO STUDENTS. 3. At the beginning of the year there were 106 students on the College rolls (vide Appendix B). During this year there were 24 fresh entries as against 38 and 41 in 1908-09 and 1907-08, respectively. Twenty-three students joined Class A and 1 joined Class C under concession (vide Rule 18). Thirty- seven students left the College, viz., 17 passed the Diploma Examination and 5 left Class C after having failed to pass that examination. Five left Class B and 10 left Class A. Two of the students who left Class B had joined under concession under College Rule 17 in January 1909. They discontinued their attendance during the middle of the year. Two left the Class in July on having failed to pass the Supplementary Examination held in March 1909 and 1 after having failed to pass the Examination in December. Two of the students left Class A after having failed to pass the examination in December and 2 because they were not allowed to go up for the examination, not having put in the required number of lectures. One having passed at the examination, left the Class with a view to joining the Madras Veterinary College, and 5 left during the middle of the year, probably to take up some other course. The number of studeuts attending the College at the close of the year was 93 as against 106 and 107 in 1908-09 and 1907-08, respectively. Pour studeuts who failed at the Diploma Examinatian in December 1908 re-entered the College in July 1909. All of these students re-appeared for the examination in December 1909. Three of them passed and 1 having failed left the College. They were not on the College rolls either at the beginning or at the end of the official year 1909-10. They are, therefore, shown in Appendix A only and not in Appendix B. Of the 93 students on the College rolls at the end of the year 35 belonged to the Town of Bombay and the several districts of the Presidency proper, 31 to Mysore, 9 to Travancore, 4 to Bhávnagar, 3 to Madras, 2 each to Goa, Ceylon and the Central Provinces and 1 each to Gondal, Sángli, Bengal, Junágadh and Kolhápur. The number of candidates who presented themselves for admission as students was 41 as against 53 and 73 iu 1808-09 and 1907-08, respectively. Of these new men 24 joined as previously stated. Of the 23 men who joined Class A, 7 only (who have been selected as scholars) are Matriculates or School Pinal men. Of the 17 who did not join, one had passed the School Final Examination, 8 failed at the Entrance Examination, 5 did not join although they passed at the examination and 3 did not submit themselves for the examination. Of the 24 students who joined the College, 10 belong to the Bombay Presidency, 8 to Mysore, 2 to Madras and 1 each to Bhávnagar, Travaucore, Ceylon and the Central Provinces. In the new admissions; there are two Mysore scholars and one Ceylon Government student. Appendix C shows the different nationalities of the students on the College rolls at the end of the year. In the new admissions there were 18 Hindus, 3 Mahomedans, 2 Native Christians and one European. GOVERNMENT SCHOLARSHIPS. 4. The total number of Government scholarships sanctioned is 21, but at the end of the last official year there were only 18 men on the scholarship list and 3 scholarships were consequently left vacant. Out of these vacant scholar- ships one was under special orders of Government, awarded in July 1909 to a Sindhi student who had failed at the Diploma Examination in December 1908. This brought the number on the list to 19. Of these 19 men, 1 left on havino- passed the Diploma Examination in December 1909 and 4 on having failed at the examination. This latter number includes the Sindhi student who was given a scholarship in July 1909. Thus in January 1910 the number of vacant scholarships was brought up to seven, 4 of which were then filled up by the
3 Director of Agriculture by selecting men from the different districts. The number of men possessing proper educational qualifications who applied to him for these scholarships was 13. In March the Principal selected men for the remaining 3 vacancies left at his disposal. Only 3 candidates possessing the required educational qualification competed for the scholarships and these were selected as they were found competent. Government intend creating special scholarships of Rs. 35 per mensem each, for Sindhi students. These scholarships are to be made tenable for three years and two of them are to be awarded annually. But this scheme has not been finally approved. BAI SAKARBAI DINSHAW PETIT HOSPITAL FOR ANIMALS. 5. The record of the Bai Sakarbai Dinshaw Petit Hospital for Animals gives the following information relative to the patients admitted :4 (c) The training of 24 bullock drivers belonging to Supply and Trans- port Corps as Dressers by the Native Teaching Staff. (d) Receiving and despatching of stallions. CONTAGIOUS DISEASE WAUD, DISSECTION AND POST-MORTEM ROOMS. 9. Government have given administrative approval for the construction of a Contagious Disease Ward and Dissection and Post-Mortem Rooms on the new College premises, and plans and estimates for the same approved by the Director of Agriculture and the Director of Public Instruction have been forwarded to the Public Works Department. The estimated cost of these buildings is Rs. 70,990. OPERATING THEATRE. 10. The Hospital authorities have now finally decided to build the opera- ting Theatre at an estimated cost of Rs. 18,981, out of which Rs. 3,399 have been contributed by Government. With the special permission of Government, this work is to be carried out through the agency of the Public Works Department. SANITARY SURVEYORS' CLASS. 11. Five Graduates were admitted to the Sanitary Surveyors' Class in January 1910. One of the five Graduates who joined the Class in January 1909 appeared for the Sanitary Surveyors' Examination in July 1909 and passed. LIBRARY. 12. The Library which is now in the new College building having been thoroughly brought up to date is constantly used by Professors and students and the increase of the grant to Rs. 1,000 on its account, has given facilities for procuring new books and new editions of the old ones. The time of the Curator and Laboratory Assistant is, however, fully occupied otherwise and he cannot remain in the Library to issue books to students. I, therefore, intend to propose a new arrangement for carrying out this work. EXCURSION. 13. The students of Class C were taken on an excursion tour to the Province of Mysore by Mr. Dhakmarvala, Professor of Bovine Pathology, and to the Bándra Slaughter House by Mr. Ware, Assistant Principal. EQUITATION. 14. Twenty-nine students of Class C went through the course of Equita- tion at the Government Body Guard Menage at Chaupátti. STUDENTS' QUARTERS. 15. The number of students residing in the quarters was 55 at the close of the year. The question of building two tennis courts in front of the quarters and a play-ground on the right of the entrance gate of the Government House at Parel is still before Government. It has also been proposed to provide further means of recreation and exercise for students by giving them a horizontal bar, parallel bars and a vaulting horse. A private practitioner has been appointed as medical attendant for the students.
5 PATHO-BACTEEIOLOGICAL LABORATORY. 16. The Laboratory work has greatly increased during the past year. Specimens consisting of blood and pus smears, pieces of dry hide for Anthrax, parasites and tumours from 492 separate animals were submitted for examina- tion and report by Graduates outside the College and exclusive of the Grlandesr and Farcy Department. These specimens were sent, with very few exceptions by Veterinary Assistants of the Civil Veterinary Department of the Bombay Presidency, Besides this the Laboratory has been of immense use for instruction purposes and in connection with cases in the Bai Sakarbai Hospital and the Glanders and Farcy Department. A special grant of Rs. 1,500 for the purchase of 6 microscopes required for the Pathology and Histology Classes to be held on the 1st floor of Sir Dinshaw Maneckjee Petit Patho-Bacteriological Laboratory is sanctioned and estimates amounting to Rs. 1,435 for a working bench required for the class room are approved. Cupboards and other furniture required to fit up the room are also being obtained. A revised proposal to build a new Bacteriological Laboratory at a cost of Rs. 18,000 has been submitted. This Laboratory will be used for carrying out research work in connection with various contagious diseases of animals which exist in this Presidency but are little understood at present. It will also be used for training Graduates in scientific investigation. In the absence of an I. C. V. D. Officer as a trained Pathologist, it will be worked by the Principal with the assistance of locally trained men. MUSEUM. 17. Many new specimens have been added during the year including three complete skeletons. Suitable specimen jars of the value of Rs. 635 have been indented for from the special grant of Rs. 1,687 sanctioned for dead stock. 18. The staff and students of the College much regret the loss they have sustained by the death of Lieut-Colonel Joslen. Colonel Joslen worked indefatigably for the well-being of the institution and for the bettering of every department in it and his loss is felt throughout. The Teaching staff including the Curator and Laboratory Assistant have performed their duties satisfactorily. 19. Mr. Phatak, the Head Clerk, and his Assistant Mr. Palnitkar continue to perform their duties very satisfactorily. 20. Appendix D is the Financial Statement of the College and Appendix E is the statement showing main results. 21. I wish to thank Mr. Doctor, the Secretary of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, for the great assistance he gives by prompt- ly carrying out any suggestions made in connection with the Hospital.

11 No. 2950 OF 1910-11. Poana, Office of the Director of Public Instruction, 16th June 1910. From THE HONOURABLE Mr,. W. H. SHARP, M.A., Director of Public Instruction, Poona ; To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Educational Department, Bombay. Sir, I have the honour to forward the Report of the Veterinary College, Parel, for the year 1909-10, together with the remarks of the Director of Agriculture thereon, and to say that I have nothing to add to the latter. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, W. H. SHARP, Director of Public Instruction
12 No. 3983-A. of 1910. From G. P. KEATINGE, ESQUIRS, I.C.S., Director of Agriculture, Bombay, Poona; To THE DIRECTOR of PUBLIC INSTRUCTION, Poona. Poona, 13th June 1910. Sir, With reference to Government Resolution No. 2286 of 8th December 1906, E. D., I have the honour to communicate to you my remarks on the Annual Report of the Bombay Veterinary College for the year 1909-10. 2. The results of the examination are satisfactory. 3. The number of students at the College is evidently declining. Only 10 new students from the Bombay Presidency joined this year, and of these 7 were provided with scholarships. Of the 20 students who obtained their diplomas, only one has been willing to join the Civil Veterinary Department. The significance of these figures has been separately reported to Government. 4. The improvement in the equipment of the College is satisfactory, and further advantage will result when the infectious disease ward and the new Bacteriological Laboratory come into existence. 5. The principle of excursions (vide para. 13 of the report) might probably be extended with advantage to places nearer home to give the students some practical knowledge of the condition of cattle in rural parts, and the improvements that might be made in their treatment both in sickness and in health. 6. The loss sustained by the College from Colonel Joslen's death is great, and much to be regretted. I have the honour to he, Sir, Your most obedient servant, G. -F. KEATINGE, Director of Agriculture.
13 No. 130L. of 1910. From M. H. SOWERBY, ESQUIRE, I. 0. V. D., Principal, Bombay Veterinary College; To The SECRETARY to GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. BOMBAY VETERINARY COLLEGE: Parel, 1st Jane 1910. SIR, I have the honour to submit the Annual Report of the Glanders and Farcy Department for the year 1909-1910. During this year I acted as Principal until 8th November 1909 when the late Lieut.-Colonel E. Joslen took charge of the appointment on his return from leave and held it up to 28th February 1910, the day on which he died from the effects of a carriage accident. On his death I took charge of the appointment which I held till the end of the official year. 2. During the year 67 horses were admitted into the Government Lazaretto at Sewree as against 123 and 142 in 1908-1909 and 1907-1908, respectively. Out of the admissions there was one confirmed case of Glanders, 42 cases of Surra, 20 suspicious cases and 4 contacts. Out of 20 suspicious cases 6 reacted to Mallein and were destroyed, 5 were found to be suffering from Epizootic Lymphangitis and one from Surra, and 8 were returned to their owners as they were found to be free from disease. Out of the 4 contacts one reacted to the Mallein test and was destroyed and 3 were returned to their owners as they were found free from disease. The number of horses destroyed this year for Glanders was 8 as against 27 and 29 in 1908-1909 and 1907-1908, respectively. Five horses suffering from Epizootic Lymphangitis were destroyed as against 2 and 1 in 1908-1909 and 1907-1908, respectively. Forty-three horses suffering from Surra were destroyed as against 72 and 73 in 1908-1909 and 1907-1908, respectively. Out of the total number of 67 horses admitted into the Lazaretto, 5 belonged to Arab dealers, one to a Persian dealer, 25 to private individuals, 34 to owners of carriages plying for hire, and 2 to the Bombay Mounted Police. Of the 8 horses destroyed for Glanders one belonged to a Persian dealer, 3 to private individuals and 4 to owners of carriages plying for hire. Of the 5 horses destroyed for Epizootic Lymphangitis, 2 belonged to Arab dealers, 2 to owners of carriages plying for hire and one to the Mounted Police. Of the 43 horses destroyed for Surra, 17 belonged to private individuals, 25 to owners of carriages plying for hire and one to the Bombay Mounted Police. The different classes of horses admitted into the Lazaretto this year were as follows :14 The Australian imports were 1,853 horses and 173 ponies as against 1,946 horses and 348 ponies and 2,516 horses and 340 ponies in 1908-1909 and 1907-1908, respectively. The Arab imports were 2,005 horses and 207 ponies as against 1,493 horses and 474 ponies and 2,160 horses and 343 ponies in 1908-1909 and 1907-1908, respectively. The Persian imports were 198 horses as against 112 horses and 236 horses in 1908-1909 and 1907-1908, respectively. This year 1 Italian and 7 Arab donkeys and 2 American mules were imported. Of the total number of imports mentioned above, 3 horses were removed to the Sewree Lazaretto from the Harbour, one as suspicious of Glanders and 2 as contacts. None reacted to the Mallein test and they were therefore returned to their owners. 4. There were six consignments of horses from Queensland. 5. A trial is being given to the curative treatment for Surra suggested by the Imperial Bacteriologist. 6. To meet the present requirements of the Department Government have sanctioned the erection of 12 fly-proof stalls of a semi-permanent nature at a cost of Rs. 11,604. 7. The Inspectors carried out their duty of inspecting different stables in a satisfactory manner. 8. Appendix II is the Financial Statement for the year under report. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, M. H. SOWERBY, I.C.V.D., Principal, Bombay Veterinary College.

Sir, I have the honour to submit for the consideration of His Excellency the Governor in Council the Annual Administration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, for the official year 1909-1910.

19 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT IN THE BOMBAY PRESIDENCY FOR THE YEAR 1909-1910. Mr. K. Hewlett held charge as Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Depart- ment, Bombay Presidency, throughout the year under report. 2. The Superintendent was away from head-quarters for 164 days as against 115 davs last year. He travelled 13,373 miles by rail, 998 miles by road and 448 miles by sea as against 9,604 miles by rail, 503 by road and 318 by sea last year. 3. Tours were made in connection with cattle breeding, horse breeding and contagious diseases of animals in various parts of the Presidency. The follow ing State Studs were visited:20 Anthrax.21 has arisen because, in oases, inoculators formerly claimed, through ignorance that the inoculation possessed virtues which it does not possess and in cose- quence the expectations of the villagers were not fulfilled and disappointment and mistrust resulted. 12. It is now the routine practice in all outbreaks attended for Veterinary Assistants to read aloud to the people printed pamphlet on the disease in question or inoculation, explain the condition, answer questions and demon- strate the line of treatment to be adopted. 13. During the year under report 588 specimens were forwarded by Veterinary Assistants to the Laboratory at the Bombay Veterinary College for bacteriological examination and report. Considerable attention has been paid to this branch of their duties by Veterinary Assistants and the information derived from the examination of the specimens will assist greatly in the correct mapping of disease areas. (2)22 are excluded the average would be 2,347. The percentage of animals belong- ing to cultivators on the total number treated amounts to 61.75. 19. The Superintendent has included this year in his review brief remarks on the financial condition of each dispensary because, under the reorganisation scheme, he is in part responsible for the purchase of medical stores, etc., and general management of the dispensaries. 20. It may be observed from a scrutiny of Table VI that the majority of the dispensaries have substantial balances to their credit in their respective Veterinary Funds. It may also be observed that the expenditure in many cases exceeds the standard estimate for maintenance of Rs. 1,200 for a 1st class dispensary and Rs. 900 for a 2nd class one. This however is accounted for in the majority of cases by the fact that the cost of buildings, repairs or additions are here included under contingencies or that the recovery orders from the Accountant General for medicines, etc., supplied by the Medical Store Depart- ment to the dispensaries last year were not received until after 1st April and so have had to be included in this year's expenditure, thus showing, in many cases, the cost of medicines, etc., for two years this year. In dispensaries where a very large number of patients is treated or where a large proportion of patients are in-door ones, the subordinate staff has to be increased above the standard and in consequence items under pay (column 9) are large. The item of Rs. 1,596-15-11 under pay for the Násik Dispensary includes pay of the Veteri- nary Assistant in charge, as in that dispensary his salary is paid from the Veteri- nary Fund and not from Provincial Revenues as is the case for all others. 21. The delay in the receipt of recovery orders for medicines supplied by the Medical Store causes much inconvenience and renders accurate estimates of expenditure for any given year almost impossible. The fact that there is no means of ascertaining the probable cost of an indent for medicines is also opposed to economical management. 22. Dhulia Dispensary.23 medicines and instruments amounts to only Rs. 21-3-0 which is due to the medicine recovery order not being received. 24. Jalgaon Dispensary.24 at the new dispensary, of which 21 were equities, 116 bovines, and 34 others. The dispensary had to be closed from 27th January to 6th March as the Veteri- nary Assistant had to attend a course of instruction in inoculation at Bareilly. The dispensary has only been open for a few days and no estimate can be formed as to its work. Veterinary Assistant Govaikar was in charge of the old itinerating dispensary for the remainder of the year, with the exception of from 5th July to 18th July when he held temporary charge of the Násik Dispensary and 10th November to 1st December when he was on leave without pay. He was also absent 19 days on casual leave. He was on tour for 132 days and treated 846 cases. He attended 31 outbreaks of disease. He performed no inoculations. The financial statement shows a balance of Rs. 2,744-1-5. The expenditure was Rs. 849-14-7. 28. Ahmednagar Dispensary.25 treated was 16.1. The Veterinary Assistant was on tour for 10 days, attended 6 outbreaks of contagious disease, translated leaflets on various subjects into Maráthi and lectured. The dispensary was inspected on 5th August 1909. This dispensary is making excellent progress and is one of the most successful and best managed in the Presidency. The sum of Rs. 1,145-9-0 was realised from fees although they are levied from well-to-do people only. This does not indicate that the dispensary is only used by such people as of the 3,408 cases treated, 2,009 were treated free. Veterinary Assistant Marathe has worked hard and conscientiously during the year. The cattle population within a radius of 5 miles is 21,900 and 1,602 cattle were treated giving a percentage of 7.4. The buildings of this dispensary are excellent and complete. The financial statement shows a balance of Rs. 1,592-15-10. The expenditure was Rs. 3,086. This amount is accounted for as follows:26 dispensary was inspected on 15th July 1909. This dispensary has made very good progress during the year (the second only of its existence) and the work of Veterinary Assistant Phatak has been satisfactory.

III.33 the succeeding year. The breeding cows will be increased next year by 43 heifers which are now coming on (for details see statement appended to Table IX). In all there were 14 casualties during the year including the Scows abovementioned which died of old age; 3 heifers died (2 of snake bite and 1 of fracture) 1 heifer and 1 bullock were sent to the Pinjrapole ; 6 calves died from pneumonia, &c. There was no contagious disease among the farm cattle although several villages in the vicintiy were affected. There is now an ample fodder reserve consisting of S50,000 lbs. hay and 40,000 lbs. Kurby as against 600,000 lbs. hay last year. The farm was visited during the year by the following officers : Sir John Muir- Mackenzie, Colonel Pease, Inspector-General, Civil Veterinary Department; Mr. Mollison, Inspector-General of Agriculture ; Colonel Joslen ; Mr. Keatinge, Director of Agriculture; Mr. Mead ; Major Farmer, Superintendent, Government Cattle Farm, Hissar, and Mr. Shearer, Assistant Inspector-General of Agri- culture. (2).34 however attended the Show and acted as one of the judges. The other was held at Ahmedabad, a non-selected district, and is therefore under the supervision of the Civil Veterinary Department. 68. The Ahmedabad Horse Show.35 (Senior)36 District. He toured actively in the district and visited most of the outbreaks, advised preventive measures and explained the nature of the disease to the people ; but as the Act is not applied to the district he could not enforce the measures he recommended. He travelled 299 miles by road and 711 miles by rail. 84. Veterinary Assistant B. B. Joshi was on duty for 6 weeks, prior to taking over at Mahad, in the Dhárwár District to permit of Veterinary Assistant Sane attending outbreaks of disease in the district. Veterinary Assistant Gandhi was placed for a period of probationary training at Nadiád from 1st June to 15th July and at Ahmedabad from 15th July to 20th September, prior to taking charge of the Viramgaum dispensary. Veterinary Assistant C. N. Desai was also placed for a period of probationary training at Ahmedabad from 4th Septem- ber to 9th October and then took charge of the Nadiád dispensary during Mr. Maniar's absence to deal with Surra. He then proceeded to Broach. 85. The work of the various Veterinary Assistants has been referred to in the review of the working of the dispensaries of which they were in charge. 86. During the year under report 6 Veterinary Assistants were deputed to undergo a course of training in anti-rinderpest inoculation at the Laboratory at Bareilly. They all successfully passed the prescribed test at the end of the course and are certified to be capable to inoculate by the " Serum alone method ". The entire staff, with two exceptions, has now been through the course. 87. The standard of professional knowledge of the Veterinary Assistants as a whole is not high. In fact some of them have degenerated into mere empirics and some are incompetent. There is great need for improvement in this respect and the question of establishing post graduate courses was mooted during the year under report. 88. The clerical establishment of the Superintendent's office was increased by 1 additional clerk during the year. 89. The Superintendent desires to place on record his appreciation of the work of his Head Clerk, Mr. V. Y. Sohoni, and his Second Clerk, Mr. R, H. Dange. Mr. Sohoni is exceptionally able and painstaking, and both of these clerks have worked with unremitting zeal during the year under report, as also for the last 5 years during which time they have been allowed no privilege leave, very- few days casual leave, and have been required to work frequently on Sundays and other holidays. They deserve credit for their work. V.37 93. He also submitted detailed lists of duties which he suggested should be the recognised ones of the Superintendent (vide letter No. 1930, dated 10th August 1909) of the Inspectors and the Veterinary Assistants respectively in order that there should be a clearly defined division of labor for each and so that each should know what his share in the general scheme should be. 94. With a view to secure uniformity of the working in the Yeterinary dispensaries, model dispensary rules, together with a form for dispensary budget estimates on the lines sanctioned in Government Resolution, Financial Depart- ment, No. 5083, dated 14th December 1908, were drafted by the Superintendent and submitted for Government sanction, vide letter No. 1856, dated 5th August 1909, to the address of the Director of Agriculture. 95. In order to bring the rules for inspection of dispensaries and the forms of registers to be used in them (sanctioned in Government Resolution, Revenue Department, No. 6351, dated 1st September 1893) upto date and in line with the present organisation of the Department the Superintendent submitted draft rules for the approval of Government (vide letter No. 1924, dated 7th August 1909). 96. The large increase in the number of cattle shows held annually calls for special remark. The Inspector, Civil Veterinary Department, Central Division, was obliged to attend 8 shows, and each show lasts some days. Moreover, the shows are all held in the fair season. The Inspector's work in connection with, dispensaries and outbreaks and detailed tours had to be somewhat curtailed in consequence of the shows. If the number of shows increases an additional Inspector will be essential. 97. As a result of the Inspectorship of the Southern Division being vacant, the supervision of the dispensaries there has been less than it should have been. Irregularities were detected in one or two dispensaries there, and the Inspector, Central Division, had to be deputed to investigate. The inoculation campaign in the south has not been pushed as much as it might have been if there had been an energetic and efficient Inspector in charge. 98. There has been much, difficulty during the year under report in obtaining the services of Veterinary Assistants for the Department. This matter was represented in letter No. 328, dated 21st January 1910, in which certain recommendations were made for improving the pay and prospects of the staff. 99. The Superintendent considers that the Department has made progress along sound lines during the year. K. HEWLETT, Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, Poona.

50a REVIEW BY THE DIRECTOR OF AGRICULTURE. Below letter No. 1539, dated 23rd June 1910, from the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, to the Under Secretary to Government, Revenue Department, Bombay. No. A-5368 op 1910. Poona, 4th August 1910. Forwarded with compliments. 2. Undersigned has recently expressed his views in detail regarding the various branches of work now being undertaken by the Civil Veterinary Department and does not propose to repeat them. 3. The re-organization of the Civil Veterinary Department has been carried out during the past year and has thrown much additional work on the Superintendent. 4. There is now a Veterinary Inspector for each division, and valuable results may be looked for from this source. It is hoped that in addition to performing their duties of inspecting the Dispensaries they will be able to organise operations for checking contagious diseases, and may establish a closer relation between the dispensary and the people of the tract in which it is situated. G. F. KEATINGE, Director of Agriculture. B 309
51 No. 18552 Bovines. Rinderpest,53 and equipped last year has not been opened as sanction is awaited to constitute a subordinate Veterinary Department in Sind. It did not seem to me worth while to entertain a man for this post on one rate of pay one day, and perhaps on the following offer him a lower rate, which would happen under the scheme I proposed for Sind (Mr. Hewlett's). The building of a hospital at Sukkur contemplated two years ago has been delayed as the Military Authorities finally declined to part with the land selected for the purpose. Karáchi Veterinary Hospital Veterinary Graduate S. G. Haji held charge of this institution throughout the year and was assisted by his son from the 5 th November. The total number of patients treated by them at the hospital during the year is shown at 3,524 (in and out-patients) and 964 on tour, 4,488 in all against 5,951 last year. Of the total treated at the hospital it will be seen in Table V that 1,135 were equines, 1,475 bovines and 914 other animals. The decrease in the numbers compared with last year is chiefly accounted for by excluding inoculation cases from this year's calculation, such figures being noted above under para. 6. Mr. Haji senior visited 36 villages. Thirty-eight cases of castrations were performed as against 22 performed last year. The financial condition of the dispensary is shown in Table VI attached. It shows Rs. 11,751-4-5 under the head receipts and Rs. 11,472-12-3 under that of expenditure, leaving a balance of Rs. 278-8-2 at the credit of the dispensary at the close of the year. One thousand five hundred and eighty-two horses were shod at the shoeing forge attached to this dispensary against 1,518 shod last year. The receipts at the shoeing forge amounted to Rs. 2,411 and expenditure to Rs. 1,377-14-0 which left a surplus balance of Rs. 1,033-2-0 against Rs. 809-15-0 last year. Although this is quite a good profit it is made notwithstanding that the shoeing is still indifferently done. It is next to impossible to get a horse well shod in Karachi, (it is difficult almost anywhere in India) but so long as a shoe will remain on for a month or six weeks the average owner appears to be satisfied and does not look for a well forged shoo or a foot properly prepared, and the primitive method of one man holding up the foot while another, the farrier (?) pares it with a knife (which he is strictly told not to do) and then tacks the shoe on is to be still seen at this forge. So much then for the trouble taken at the Veterinary Colleges to try and impart the knowledge of the art of farriary to students in Veterinary Science, and through them to a " nalband " and also so much for instructing nalbands themselves at the Colleges. The cattle population within a radius of 5 miles of this hospital is reported to be 8,4S5 and the cattle treated at the hospital number 1,475 which gives a percentage of 17.38 against last year's 35.71. The reason for this falling off is accounted for by the fact that inoculation cases have this year been excluded from column 26 of Table V while they were included last year. Fees are charged at Karachi for all stock belonging to those who are consi- dered in a position to pay for advice and treatment. The sum of Rs. 1,358-14-0 were realized against Rs. 1,538-6-0 last year. The explanation offered for this falling off in the earnings, (which is quite contrary to expectations in that there was no competition in the shape of the presence of any other veterinary practi- tioner in Karachi during the year, whilst during a good portion of the year an assistant has been entertained) is that fewer animals were treated at the hospital during the year under report than in the previous year. Hyderabad Veterinary Hospital and Dispensary.54 The salutri attached to the dispensary while on tour visited 3 villages regu- larly every month and treated 786 cases, 21 for contagious and 765 non- contagious diseases, against a total of 515 treated last year. Table VI shows the financial position of the hospital, vis., Rs. 5,032-13-10 under the head receipts and Rs. 4,386-5-8 under that of expenditure which left a balance of Rs. 646-8-2 at the close of the year. The cattle population within a radius of 5 miles of the dispensary is 6,250 and the number of cattle treated at the institution 788 which gives a percentage of 12.60 against 12.40 last year. Fees are charged at this hospital and the amount realized under this head during the year was Rs. 305-9-0 against Rs. 316-7-0 realized last year. Nausháhro Hospital and Dispensary.55 Five horses were castrated at this dispensary, the same number as last year. Shikárpur Veterinary Hospital and Dispensary.56 anticipating that it would be useless to hold it. The anticipation proved correct as the show was a failure from every point. The competitors were so ill-assorted in some instances as to render it impossible to judge at all. There was a class for yearling bulls. No greater mistake under the present methods of rearing stock in Sukkur could be made than that of attempting to teach people to emasculate cattle by this age, and the introduction of the class should prove to any thinking Indian farmer we must know very little about rearing his cattle. These are the sort of mistakes I beg to be allowed to say we should try and avoid and which often could be if expert advice were followed. Talhar.57 14. A propos of a subordinate department, it may be observed here that in response to orders, schemes for the formation of two subordinate departments in this circle were submitted during the year under report. That for Sind, which was submitted in July, urged that the excellent proposals drawn up by Mr. Hewlett for the Presidency Proper and Sind should be adopted as eminently suitable, especially if it should be deemed advisable at any future date to amalgamate Sind with the Presidency Proper, under the orders of one depart- mental head, which I anticipate will become an indispensable arrangement. 15. During the year I gave an expression of my opinion on the subject of cattle shows and the distribution of bulls as unsatisfactory means of encourag- ing the production of a better class of stock. These views were placed for discussion before the Agricultural Conference at Pusa in February and it is earnestly hoped that the Conference will have arrived at some conclusions which suggest ways and workable methods whereby it will be feasible to get the people to realize the value of making efforts to improve their cattle, where improvement is required, and to maintain old established breeds, where they still exist or flourish. With regard to the subject of the bettering of cattle in India, it is to be observed that apparently the three senior executive officers of the Indian Civil Veterinary Department, independently of each other, are in accord that cattle shows are of little value as a stimulus to breeding. In connection with this subject of cattle breeding, I have suggested at some length that the Director of Agriculture might be consulted on the advis- ability of following the course adopted by other Provinces, and start a farm at Mirpur Khás, that is, if it is desirable to see whether and how far it is possible to raise the standard of Sind cattle by judicious feeding, selection in mating and general good management. The main idea I had in my mind of a farm being to prove to a people who have been farmers and pastoral stock owners for gener- ations, what it is possible to achieve, before advising them upon a subject in which many of them may be our masters. On the other hand, it is very questionable whether there would be any great value in such a project, as there is no doubt but that large numbers of farmers in this part of the country know what should be done, and how it can be clone if they are anxious to better their cattle, and there is sufficient proof to warrant this remark, for example, round about Karachi there are numbers of men who are very well off due to their line of farming being to breed an excellent and profitable dairy cow, and, as Karachi expands the demand for milk will increase and no doubt sufficiently to stimulate this industry. However these farmers will determine that point themselves. Again just beyond the confines of the Upper Sind Frontier District, there is another farming community who breed as fine a class of draught oxen as there is to be seen anywhere in India where quality, conformation and strength is concerned, and from which stock they realized from Government alone, at two shows, a sum approaching two thou- sand pounds sterling (the cost of about 300 head) at present we can teach these folk very little our Western methods and conditions for raising stock are absolutely different and at present, generally inapplicable to India but to a certain extent they could be adopted on a farm. Throughout the year the weekly season reports stated that the agricultural cattle in the several districts kept in good condition and there was a sufficient supply of fodder. Disease was seldom brought to notice. 16. During the year under report, the Government of Western Australia furnished information in reply to questions on the subject of camels and camel breeding. They say that this stock in their country had all round, considerably advanced since they commenced importing it from Sind and elsewhere (some forty years ago), and that the results which are due to the enterprize and common sense of the Australian are so encouragaing that their State and that of South Australia think there is a possibility of the industry developing into an export trade with Asiatic countries, which are the original habitat of the camel. As questions have been raised in connection with the difficulty experienced in finding camels in Sind and Baluchistan of a suitable stamp and condition for B 30958 Silledar Camel Corps, the above report together with a note by this office on certain matters pertaining to camel breeding was submitted to the Honourable the Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan, and copies were forwarded to the Quarter-Master General in India, Inspector-General, Indian Civil Veterinary Department, the Commissioner in Sind and the Collector of Sukkur. As the subject is too long to include here, a reference is respectfully invited to the correspondence. If cattle breeding59 TABLE II.

During the year Sind was comparatively free from outbreaks of contagious disease. Major Trydell was unable from causes beyond his control to give to this part of his charge so much attention as it required. A scheme has been sanctioned which will afford assistance to the Superintendent and extend the grant of veterinary aid as soon as funds are available for its introduction. 6.

13 No. 121 L of 1911. BOMBAY VETERINARY COLLEGE : Perel, 16th May 1911. From K. HEWLETT, ESQUIRE, I.C.V.D., Principal, Bombay Veterinary College; To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. Sir, I have the honour to submit herewith the Annual Administration Report of the Glanders and Farcy Department for the year 1910-1911. 2. Mr. Sowerby held charge of the Department until June 27th when I took over the appointment vice the late Lieutenant-Colonel Joslen. The Staff consists of a Chief Inspector and 5 Inspectors whose duty it is to inspect all the horses within the confines of the City of Bombay and Bandra Munici- pality, as well as those imported from over sea, with the object of detecting and seizing cases of disease scheduled under the Glanders and Farcy Act. 3. During the year under report, 63 horses were seized under the Act, as against 67 last year. Of these 42 were found to be diseased within the meaning of the Act and the remaining 21 were discharged. Of these 42 animals, 9 were suffering from Glanders-Farcy and 3 from Epizootic Lymphangitis and were in consequence destroyed; the remaining 30 were suffering from Surra and of these, 11 were destroyed as soon as a diagnosis had been arrived at, while 19 were subjected to treatment, and of these 18 succumbed or were destroyed (as they did not improve) and one was discharged cured. 4. The following table shows the number of cases of the various diseases dealt with this year under the Act as compared with former years :14 succumbed under treatment and 12 after prolonged trial, showing no improve- ment, were destroyed and one was discharged as cured having remained free from trypanosomes in the circulation for six months. 8. During the year under report 6,329 horses, 14 donkeys and 79 mules were imported into Bombay as against 4,646 horses, 8 donkeys and 2 mules last year and 4,597 horses, 34 donkeys and 149 mules in the preceding year. Of the imports 198 were English, 3,196 Australians, 2,641. Arabian (14 donkeys, 79 mules), 337 Persian, 33 Country Bred, 2 Burman, 6 Shetland, 1 French, 6 Hungarian and 2 Zebras, as against 157 English, 2,026 Australian, 2,219 Arabian (7 donkeys), 198 Persian, 16 Country Bred, 7 Burman, 2 Shetland, 9 American (2 mules), 2 French and 1 Italian (donkey). There were 7 consign- ments of Queensland horses. 9. The improvements to the Lazaretto for Animals at Sewree have not, as yet, been carried out and a scheme has been submitted whereby the Lazaretto at Sewree may be handed over to the Bombay Veterinary College as an Hospital for Contagious Animal Diseases and after being improved on suitable lines, utilised not only as a place where animals seized under the Act may be detained, but also where animals suffering from other contagious diseases may be kept and where demonstrations of contagious diseases of all classes of live stock may be given to the students and where research work into imperfectly understood conditions may be undertaken. 10. A scheme has also been submitted whereby the Staff of the Glanders and Farcy Department may be brought on to the cadre of the Provincial Subordinate Civil Veterinary Department instead of being separately classified. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, K. HEWLETT, Principal, Bombay Veterinary College.

Sir, I have the honour to submit for the consideration of His Excellency the Governor in Council the Annual Administration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, for the official year 1910-1911. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, H. M. MAXWELL, Lt.-Col., Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency. THROUGH THE DIRECTOR OF AGRICULTURE, BOMBAY, Poona.

It will be seen from the following review of the various dispensaries that useful progress has been made in most instances with a considerable increase in the average number of patients treated. The average number of cases treated per dispensary is 2,512 against 2,226 last year. But if the three dispen- saries newly opened at the close of the financial year be excepted the average would be 2,715. 12. Dhulia Dispensary.22 giving a percentage of 20.71. Fees are levied. Steady progress has been made at this dispensary and Mr. Soman has done good work. 15. Amalner Dispensary.23 and Yeola and treated Municipal cattle. The cattle population within a radius of 5 miles is 6,548, the number of cattle treated 589, which gives a percentage of 9.00. No fees are levied. This dispensary has only been opened one year and as the Veterinary Assistant had to be much on tour its progress was retarded as it had to be closed when he was away. A trained compounder has now been added to the staff obviating the necessity to close, and improvement is already observable. Mr. Grovaikar has done good work, and the energy he has displayed in preventive inoculation is favourably noticed. 19. Málegaon Dispensary.24 against 1,473 last year. Of these 136 were equines, 567 bovines, 326 others. The daily average attendance was 13.6 and the proportion of cultivators' animals treated 92.85.

Marathe held charge as Inspector of the Southern Division with head-quarters at Belgaum. He was away from head-quarters for 160 days, travelled 9,173 miles by rail, 1,066 by road and 753 by sea. He inspected all the dispensaries in his division once in every three months; special attention was paid to Chikodi, Sirsi and Panvel dispen- saries. He attended the cattle markets at Belgaum, Bail-Hongal, Bijápur and Dhárwár, visited the Hubli Pinjrapole, the Gadag Agricultural Farm and Mounted Police Lines at Dhárwár. He attended the cattle fairs at Devargudda, Jath, Hosritti and Chinchli, delivered lectures and distributed leaflets on several diseases of cattle. He attended and organised the cattle shows at Panvel and Belgaum and acted as one of the judges. He also attended two outbreaks of rinderpest at Vaghawade, Belgaum District, and one of Foot and Mouth disease at Pala in Kárwár District. He was deputed to Allahabad to attend the exhibition. Mr. Marathe was only promoted to Inspector in July last. During the time he has held the appointment he has worked hard to acquaint himself with his division and its requirements. Mr. Marathe is keen and energetic and will, I hope, with more experience continue to develop and increase the efficiency of the Department in his division. (c) Mr. J. K. Bhatt held charge as Inspector of the Northern Division with head-quarters at Ahmedabad throughout the year under report. He was on tour for 214 days against 173 last year, travelled 16,101 miles by rail, 1,351½ by road against 8,519 and 654 by rail and road respectively last year. He inspected all the dispensaries and Government stallions in his division once every two months, and in cases where Junior Graduates were in charge at more frequent intervals. He also inspected the Local Board bulls in the Ahmedabad and Kaira Districts several times, visited 11 slaughter-houses, 9 meat markets, and 20 Pinjrapoles, and cattle markets at Dohad, Ahmedabad and Surat. He attended and organised the cattle show at Viramgám, and horse and cattle show at Ahmedabad, exhibited 283 articles consisting chiefly of animal food of Gujarat, varieties of fodder, horse and cattle shoes in health and disease, horse and carriage requisites, and a Medical chest. He also attended 32 outbreaks of contagious diseases against 2 last year, performed 851 inoculations against rinderpest, inspected 31 Surra cases in the Dak lines and many in the Thána District. He selected sites for Veterinary dispensaries at Bulsár, Dohad, Anand, Viramgám, Bárdoli and Dholka. He attended the Allahabad Exhibition. Mr. Bhatt is a keen and energetic officer, and has worked his division well. He has been specially active in connection with contagious diseases of Surra and Rinderpest, but every endeavour must be made to push inoculation work in connection with the latter disease. Mr. Bhatt delivered some excellent lectures at various shows and made a most interesting exhibition in the Veterinary Department of the Ahmedabad show. 67. During the year under report 6 Veterinary Assistants were deputed to undergo a course of training in anti-rinderpest inoculation at the Laboratory at Bareilly. They all successfully passed the prescribed test at the end of the course and were certified to be eligible to inoculate by the " Serum alone " method. 68. My thanks are due to my Head Clerk, Mr. Vishnu Yeshvant Sohoni, who has worked hard and given me every assistance since I took charge of the Department. Mr. Sohoni is an able clerk, and a thoroughly trustworthy and reliable man. Mr. R. H. Dange and Mr. Godbole, my 2nd and 3rd clerks, and all others of the office staff have worked hard and satisfactorily. V.36 shows that the total expenditure amounted to Rs. 2,52,314-15-11 as against Rs. 1,50,796-4-5 last year, showing an increase of Rs. 1,01,518-11-6. Of the total expenditure Rs. 37,326-3-10 were debited to the Imperial funds, Rs. 1,62,545-10-9 were paid from the Provincial funds, and Rs. 52,443-1-4 were charged to Local funds. VI.37 73.

New dispensaries have been opened, the horse-breeding operations have been extended and the work of the Department in general is expanding. 3. The Superintendent has exercised a careful and judicious control of the operations during the past year; but the Department has now reached a stage when it is necessary to give him some assistance in the supervision of the work. 4. Proposals for the appointment of a Deputy Superintendent have already been submitted. G. F. KEATINGE, Director of Agriculture. B- 14955 No. 102-54-C of 1910. From MAJOR A. S. TRYDELL.

57 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE INDIAN CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, IN SIND, FOR THE OFFICIAL YEAR 1910-1911. GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. Major A. S. Trydell held charge of the office of Indian Civil Veterinary Department, Sind, Baluchistan and Rajpulana throughout the year under report. 2. Owing to his not having hitherto visited Rajputana and for want of more funds he was unable to undertake any tours under canvas in the province of Sind, but he inspected the veterinary dispensaries in the province and visited Halla in the Hyderabad District to enquire into rinderpest in that vicinity. He attended the local camel fair at Oderolal and the cattle show held at Talhar, Hyderabad District. He travelled 1,311 miles by rail and 85 miles by road* as against 2,701 miles by rail and 20 miles by road travelled last year. I58 Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia.59 when he was deputed on professional work in the district. Mr. S. G. Haji (senior) during the year under report was directed from time to time to investigate and suppress outbreaks of cattle disease. He was out in the district from May to September, November and December 1910 and again in January and February 1911. The total number of patients treated at this hospital during the year under report is shown at 3,313 (in and out patients) and 1,678 on tour, 4,991 in all, against a total of 4,488 treated last year. It will be seen in Table V that out of the total treated at the hospital, 1,259 were equines, 1,207 bovines and 847 other animals against 1,135 equines, 1,475 bovines and 914 others treated last year. The average daily attendance of the patients treated at the hospital was 124.25 against 129.88 last year. There is a small decrease in the number of patients treated at the hospital accounted for by a falling off in the number of cattle population within a radius of 5 miles of the dispensary during the year under report There is an increase over last year in the number of animals treated on tour, vide Table IV. Messrs. Haji visited 160 villages while on tour against 36 visited last year. 25 animals were castrated at the hospital as against 38 castrated last year. The senior Veterinary Graduate inoculated 2,348 animals with anti-rinder- pest serum during the year against 321 animals inoculated last year. The financial condition of the hospital is shown in Table VI attached. It shows Rs. 11,294-6-2 under the head " Receipts " and Rs. 10,889-3-9 under " Expenditure ", leaving a balance of Rs. 405-2-5 at the credit of the hospital at the close of the year under report against Rs. 278-8-2 last year. In all 1,590 horses were shod at the shoeing forge attached to this hospital during the year against 1,582 horses shod last year. The cost of working the shoeing forge is given at Rs. 1,326-4-10 during the year 1910-1911 against Rs. 1,377-14-0 in the preceding year and the income at Rs. 2,484-14-0 against Rs. 2,411 last year. The net income from the forge was Rs. 1,158-9-2 against Rs. 1,033-2-0 last year. The cattle population within a radius of 5 miles of this hospital is reported to have fallen off from 8,485 during 1909-1910 to 3,204 during the year under report, while the cattle treated at the hospital was 1,207 giving a percentage of cattle treated at 37.67 against 17.38 last year. Pees are charged at the hospital for advice and treatment of animals belonging to well-to-do people residing within the Municipal or Cantonment limits. A sum of Rs. 1,525-8-0 was realized during the year under report against Rs. 1,358-14-0 realized last year. This shows an increase of Rs. 166-10-0 over last year. Mr. Haji (senior) as usual worked well during the year under report and in consideration of the services he has rendered the title of Khan Sahib was conferred on him during the year and a grant of a personal allowance of Rs. 50 per mensem. Hyderabad Veterinary Hospital and Dispensary.60 While on duty he visited 3 villages regularly every month and treated 606 cases while on tour, vide Table IV, against the same number of villages visited regularly every month and treated 786 cases last year. Table VI furnishes information regarding the financial condition of the hospital. It shows Rs. 5,080-13-2 under the head " Receipts" and Rs. 5,015-3-6 under that of " Expenditure", leaving a balance of Rs. 65-9-8 at the close of the year against Rs. 646-8-2 last year. The cattle population within a radius of 5 miles of the hospital is reported to he 7,500 and the number of cattle treated at the hospital being 95 4, it gives a percentage of 12.72 against 12.60 last year. The average daily attendance of patients treated at the hospital was 30.40 against 25.1 last year. The amount realized on account of fees for treatment of animals is Rs. 254-13-0 against the sum of Rs. 305-9-0 realized last year. The Veterinary Graduate attended the Talhar cattle show and Badin local fair and was in charge of the Municipal bullocks of the Conservancy Department. Naushahro Feroz Hospital and Dispensary.61 close of 1909-1910. As the hospital was not working during 1909-1910, the- figures did not appear in the report submitted last year. The opening balance therefore, as shown in column 2 of Table VI, has been brought over from last year and this is the amount which has been shown under '' Receipts." The expenditure during the year under report was Rs. 275-15-6 and the balance available at the credit of the hospital at the end of the year has been shown at Rs. 1,262-9-9. Lárkána Veterinary Hospital and Dispensary.62 No fees are charged except for treatment of animals sent under the Cruelty to Animals Act. Jacobabad Veterinary Hospital and Dispensary.63 account of the Indian Civil Veterinary Department, in the province of Sind, against a total expenditure of Rs. 54,027-13-11 incurred last year. The amount shown under the head " Imperial" is the expenditure incurred by the office of the Superintendent, Indian Civil Veterinary Department, Sind, Baluchistan and Rájputána, at Karáchi, which has been compiled from the books of this office at the suggestion of the Comptroller, India Treasuries, who is unable to furnish information under the heading. It is Rs. 22,965-10-10 during the year under report against Rs. 20,980-10-5 last year. The small increase under this head is partly due to the entertainment of a Khalási throughout the year under report and partly to the increased rent paid for office building during 1910-1911. The figures under " Provincial" have been supplied by the Accountant General, Bombay. It is Rs. 5,638-0-9 against Rs. 6,014-12-8 last year. The sum of Rs. 29,956-10-9 shown under " Local" has been supplied by the Collectors and Deputy Commissioners in Sind and represents the expenditure incurred on the Veterinary hospitals and cattle shows in the province against a sum of Rs. 27,032-6-10 expended last year. The increase is due to the addi- tions to the buildings at the Shikárpur Hospital. VI.64 serious character are now known to be more wide-spread than hitherto demonstrated. Four years ago surra was said to he practically non-existent latterly it has been shown to he fairly common and as the surra flies are extremely numerous in the district, it is anticipated that it will in time be proved that the disease is very, if not extremely, coram on in camels and horses. 15. In concluding this report it may he observed that as all matters connected with equine disease in Sind should he controlled by the Army Re- mount Department and are not within the province of the Civil Veterinary Department (except in so far as horses may be treated at Civil Veterinary hospitals) the fact was represented to the Commissioner. The question arose through the Superintendent having been asked for his opinion with reference to the advisability of scheduling surra under the Glanders and Farcy Act. 16. In the above report it will be seen that Veterinary Graduates have been treating horses for surra in the district which should, according to the ruling of the Government of India, have been dealt with by the Army Remount Department. It is now hoped that this ruling will have been made clear and that the district authorities will in future be so good as to report outbreaks of equine disease direct to the Army Remount Authorities. A. S. TRYDELL, Major, Superintendent, Indian Civil Veterinary Department, Sind, Baluchistan and Rájputána.

REVENUE DEPARTMENT. Bombay Castle, 9th November 1911. Letter from the Principal, Bombay Veterinary College, No. 121-L., dated 16th May 19112 3. In Sind there were seven dispensaries in working order at the close of the year, or one more than last year. In the Karáchi District very marked progress in rinderpest inoculation was effected through the efforts of the Collector, Mr. Lawrence. In other respects the work of the Department in this Province has been satisfactorily carried out under Major Trydell's control. Government concur with the Commissioner in Sind that, while equine disease in Sind may be especially within the cognisance of the Army Remount Department, the outbreak of disease such as surra should continue to be dealt with by the civil veterinary graduates, when no other veterinary agency is available. 4. The administration of the Glanders and Farcy Department continued to be efficient. R. D. BELL, Under Secretary to Government. To The Commissioner in Sind, With copies of the report.

From W. W. SMART, ESQUIRE, B.A., I. C. S., Acting Director of Agriculture, Bombay, Poona; To The CHIEF SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. Poona, 14th June 1912. Sir, I have the honour to forward the Annual Report of the Principal, Bombay Veterinary College. 2.The decrease in the number of students is not to be regretted as a more rigid selection of candidates and the weeding out of unsuitable students prevent disappointment in the end and allow of more efficient tuition. 3.The absence of Sindhi scholars, especially of Mahomedans, is serious and may be brought to the notice of the Commissioner in Sind. I cannot find any Mahomedan to fill a vacancy in the new Sujawal dispensary, and the question requires investigation. 4.The re-organization of the College staff was effected from January 1st. Money has been provided for the building of the Principal's quarters this year, and the further additions to the College are under the consideration of Government. It is hoped with reference to the concluding portion of paragraph 9 of the Principal's report that Government will see their way to increase the grant for minor works for the current year as the sum allotted to the Director is utterly inadequate for this and other more pressing needs. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, W. W. SMART, Acting Director of Agriculture.

HEWLETT, ESQUIRE, M.R.C.V.S., Principal, Bombay Veterinary College; To The SECRETARY TOGOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. Sir, I have the honour to submit herewith the Annual Administration Report of the Glanders and Farcy Department for the year 1911-1912. 2.I held charge of the Department throughout the year under report. 3.During the year under report 85 horses were seized under the Act as against 63 last year. Of these, 66 were found to be diseased within the meaning of the Act. Of the remaining 69, two died and 17 were discharged. Of the 66 diseased animals 3 were suffering from Glanders-farcy, 3 from Epizootic Lymphangitis and 60 from Surra. 4.The following table shows the number of cases of the various diseases dealt with this year under the Act as compared with former years:14 9 American (2 mules), 2 French and 1 Italian (donkey). There were 6 consign- ments of Queensland horses. 8. During the year under report the Sewree Lazaretto for Animals was handed over from the Glanders and Farcy Department to the Bombay Veterinary College and is to be utilised as a Contagious-disease hospital for animals wherein not only can animals seized under the Act be dealt with, but also where students can be shown the commoner contagious animal diseases. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, K. HEWLETT, M.R.C.V.S., Principal, Bombay Veterinary College.

Sir, I have the honour to submit for the consideration of His Excellency the Governor in Council the Annual Administration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department for the official year 1911-12. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, H. M. MAXWELL, Lieut-Colonel, Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency. THROUGH THE DIRECTOR OF AGRICULTURE, BOMBAY, POONA. B 19619 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERI- NARY DEPARTMENT IN THE BOMBAY PRESIDENCY FOR THE YEAR 1911-12. Lieut.-Colonel H. M. Maxwell held charge as Superintendent, Civil Veteri- nary Department, Bombay Presidency, throughout the year under report. 2.He was away from head-quarters for 117 days. He travelled 12,420 miles by rail and 282 miles by road. He inspected all but three stallion stands and all Veterinary Dispensaries in the Presidency Proper, except those at Ahmednagar, Násik, Málegaon, Ratnágiri, Alibág, Panvel, Mahád and Sirsi, and these will be visited shortly. In this connection I beg to respectfully point out that with the addition of several new dispensaries every year, added to the large increase in office work, it has now become impossible for the Superin- tendent unaided to efficiently carry out all of his many duties. The Director of Agriculture when reviewing the annual report of this Department for the last year stated, when referring to the Superintendent, "the Department has now reached a stage when it is necessary to give him some assistance in the supervision of the work." It is hoped that the Deputy Superintendent, whose appointment has been sanctioned, will shortly be posted to the Department, thus relieving the pressure of work. He inspected the Northcote Cattle Farm, Chharodi, five times, attended as a member of the Board of Examiners at the Bombay Veterinary College in November, and conducted the Supplementary examination held, there in March 1912. He controlled the working of the Glanders and Farcy Act in the Presidency outside the City of Bombay. I.20 Bijápur and Dhárwár. There were 1,866 attacks and 1,609 deaths as against 733 attacks and 623 deaths last year. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia.21 Manchar, Bársi, Pandharpur, Karád, Chikodi, Bail Hongal, Bágalkot, Gadag, Sirsi, Mahád, Panvel, Pálghar, Bulsár, Bárdoli, Anand, Viramoaum, and Dholka are 2nd class dispensaries. There are thus 18 1st class and 25 2nd class. The dispensary at, Miri in the Ahmednagar district non having proved successful was removed to Sangamner in the same district, that place being a larger agricultural centre. 10.Table V.22 2 young calves died. Besides the above there was a slight mortality on account of general weakness and old age. During the year under report 23 farm-bred bulls, 1 cow and 1 heifer were sold realising a sum of Rs. 3,760 against 9 bulls sold last year. A scheme for taking in bullocks of the neighbouring villages with a view to preserve them from famine was under contemplation but this had to be abandoned on account of scarcity of water, but owners of 256 head of cattle were supplied with 1,000 lbs. of hay per head on payment of Rs. 10 each. Seventeen bulls belonging to the District Local-Boards of Ahmedabad and Kaira are now being maintained, to be returned when more favourable conditions prevail, on the farm. During the year under report the following improvements have been carried out on the farm:23 15.The cost of feed, keep and transit is shown in Table XII, and the average cost for the last two years is shown below:24 V.25 TABLE II Showing the number of Deaths from Contagious Diseases amongst Animals during the year 1911-12.

The reason for this can be seen from the table for during these years the numbers of Mysore students were comparatively very large thus causing the increase in the total of students and a decrease in the percentage of Bombay students. The reason for the sudden influx of Mysore students was that during these years a large number of scholarships were given by the Mysore Government possibly to supply recruits for the Mysore State Civil Veterinary Department which at that time was in a state of rapid expansion. At present there are only 3 Mysore State scholars in the College and but few vacancies exist in Mysore for Veteri- nary Graduates. 7. Scholars.5 10. The Health of the Students.6 APPENDIX A.

Camp Poona, dated 80th June 1913. Sir, I have the honour to submit for the consideration of His Excellency the Governor in Council the Annual Administration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, for the official year 1912-13. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, H. M. MAXWELL, Lieut.-Colonel, Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency. THROUGH THE DIRECTOR OF AGRICULTURE, BOMBAY, POONA, n 919 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERI- NARY DEPARTMENT IN THE BOMBAY PRESIDENCY FOR THE YEAR 1912-13.

He attended the cattle show at Sholápur and the Gujarat Horse Show at Ahmedabad. He inspected the Government cattle farm at Chharodi 5 times. He acted as President of the Board of Examiners at the Bombay Veterinary College in November and December 1912 and conducted the supplementary examination held there in March 1913. He visited Arab stables in Bombay several times with a view to purchase stallions. In the beginning of the year under report, a tour was made in the Gir Forest to visit the Famine cattle camps. He also visited the cattle kitchens at Ahmedabad. He controlled the working of the Glanders and Farcy in the Presidency outside the City of Bombay. 4. Mr. J. D. Buxy held charge as Deputy Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, during the year under report, except for a period of one month from 16th December 1912 to 15th January 1913 when he was on privilege leave. 5. He travelled 6,211 miles by rail, 948 miles by road and 466 miles by sea. He inspected the Veterinary dispensaries at Bágalkot, Sirsi, Bail-Hongal, Panvel, Ratnágiri, Mahád, Manchar, Shrigonda, Sangamner, Islámpur, Shirpur, Poona, Nandurbár, Amalner, Yeola, Málegaon, Bárámati and Ankle- shvar. He also inspected the Government stallion stands at Yeola and Bárámati. He visited the Chharodi Cattle Farm once. Accompanied the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, in the Gir to visit the Famine cattle camps, visited the cattle kitchens at Ahmedabad, attended an outbreak of Anthrax in the Shrigonda Táluka of the Ahmednagar District. Supervised the working of inoculations against rinderpest at the Military Dairy Farm, Kirkee. He is directed to act as Personal Assistant to the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, and was responsible for all office work at head- quarters. 6. The appointment of Mr. J. D. Buxy as Veterinary Practitioner under the Glanders and Farcy Act was sanctioned in Government Resolution, Revenue Department, No. 8855, dated 25th September 1912, and he acted in that capacity during the year under report. 7. Mr. Buxy is the first Deputy Superintendent of the Civil Veterinary Department appointed in the Presidency proper, and the very satisfactory way in which he has carried out all his duties throughout the year fully justifies his selection for the appointment. I.20 II.21 13. During the year under report, 309 smears were forwarded by Veterinary Assistants for microscopical examination to the Bombay Veterinary College as compared with 360 last year. Forty-eight Morbid specimens were also sent for the College Museum. (2) Other Diseases. 14. Table IV will show that the Veterinary Assistants treated 20,867 cases on tour, of which 7,691 were for contagious diseases and 13,140 for non-contagious diseases against 20,894 cases last year, of which 12,048 for contagious diseases and 8,806 for non-contagious diseases. There has been a decrease of 27 in the total of cases treated on tour this year owing to the decrease in outbreaks of contagious diseases, but a large increase in the treat- ment of non-contagious cases which is satisfactory. (3) Veterinary Hospitals and Dispensaries. 15. At the commencement of the year there were 43 Veterinary dispen- saries and 3 more were opened during the year, viz., 1 at Shirpur in the West Khándesh District, 1 at lslámpur in the Sátára District, and 1 at Ankleshvar in the Broach District. Of these the following 18 dispensaries, viz., Dhulia, Jalgaon, Násik, Ahmednagar, Poona City, Sholápur, Sátára, Belgaum, Bijápur, Dhárwár, Ratnágiri, Alibág, Kalyán, Surat, Broach, Godhra, Nadiád and Ahmedabad are first class dispensaries and the remainder 28, viz., Nandurbár, Shirpur, Amalner, Sávda, Yeola, Málegaon, Sangamner, Shrigonda, Bárámati, Manchar, Bársi, Pandharpur, Karád, Islámpur, Chikodi, Bail-Hongal, Bágalkot, Gadag, Sirsi, Mahád, Panvel, Pálghar, Bulsár, Bárdoii, Ankleshvar, Anand, Viramgám and Dholka are second class dispensaries. 16. On a reference to Table V it will be seen that the Veterinary Assistants treated 106,142 cases as compared with 87,075 last year, showing an increase of 19,067. Of the above numbers 71,971 were actually brought to. the dispensaries, while 34,171 were cases supplied with medicines but not brought to the dispensaries. 17. Detailed review of each dispensary has been omitted in accordance with orders contained in Government Resolution, Revenue Department, No. 6181, dated 30th June 1911, but 1 wish to mention the special good work done during the year by the following Veterinary Assistants:22 III.23 is estimated that between 4 and 5 hundred acres can be out by machinery next season. This is a matter of great importance as the difficulty of procuring labourers to cut the grass in October and November is increasing yearly whereas when machines can be worked good hay can be ensured, and it can bo made cheaply. As this work progresses I am of opinion that the sale of hay should shortly prove a regular source of income to the farm. The farm was visited by Professor Knight with a party of Agricultural College students, Poona, by the Collector of Ahmedabad and by the Superin- tendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency. (2) EQUINES (1) Horse and Pony Stallions. 21. At the commencement of the year there were 35 stallions on the register, 9 horses and 28 ponies against 34 consisting of 10 horses and 24 ponies at the close of the year. These stallions were distributed as follows: 23 in the Deccan and 12 in Gujarát. The number of stallions actually employed at stud throughout the year was 31.86 against 33.07 last year. The total number of mares covered was 1.289 against 1,382 last year or an average of 40*46 against 41.79 last year. The average in the Deccan was 38.50 against 40.47 and in the Gujarát 44.80 against 45.08. During the year 3 stallions were purchased: 1 died, 1 sold and 2 destroyed. Considering famine has prevailed in the best horse-breeding tracts in the Deccan the above figures may be taken as satis- factory. 22. The cost of feed, keep and transit is shown in Table XII. The average cost for the last two years is as shown below:24 IV.25 have both worked hard during the year, and all other members of my office staff have worked to my entire satisfaction.

39 REVIEW BY THE DIRECTOR OF AGRICULTURE. Below letter No. 2902, dated 30th June 1913, from the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, Poona, to the Under Secretary to Government, Revenue Department, Bombay. No. A.-6712. Poona, 22nd July 1913. Forwarded with compliments. 2. The season was favourable to the health of stock which probably accounts for the decrease in the number of inoculations for rinderpest and of outbreaks of disease visited by Veterinary Assistants. It is suggested that in future reports the number of outbreaks of contagious diseases reported should be noted. 3. There were three new dispensaries opened during the year. Progress in this respect is slow and the Presidency is far behind some other Provinces. For instance Burma has 120 Veterinary Assistants and 11 Inspectors as against 54 Veterinary Assistants and 3 Inspectors in this Presidency. Conse- quently in Burma it has been possible to legislate for the repression of outbreaks of contagious diseases amongst cattle. Such legislation cannot be introduced in this Presidency until the number of dispensaries and Veterinary Assistants has increased considerably. Legislation on the lines of that introduced into Burma is very desirable in the interests of the preservation of plough and milch cattle. A reform in the procedure to be adopted in receiving and dealing with applications for new dispensaries has been effected in the course of the year, which will prevent a great deal of unnecessary delay. Also the system sanctioned for the allotment of annual contributions from Government towards the maintenance of dispensaries has facilitated the disposal of such questions and put an end to unnecessary references (vide Government Resolution No. 11741, dated 27th December 1912, Revenue Department). 4 The figures as to the number of animals treated by Veterinary Assistants and the number of dispensaries treating more than the minimum of 2,000 animals show a steady improvement. 5. The Deputy Superintendent worked throughout the year except for one month. It is suggested that future reports should show more clearly whether the object with which the appointment was sanctioned has been realised, viz., to organise and supervise a campaign of preventive inoculation and to undertake measures for the control of contagious diseases. 6. Before the close of the year under report rules for the working of the Civil Veterinary Department and for the inspection of veterinary dispensaries received the sanction of Government. 7. Steady progress has been maintained in the Department under Lieut.- Colonel Maxwell's guidance and it is satisfactory to note that such a larger number of officers subordinate to him have done good work. W. W. SMART, Acting Director of Agriculture.
41 No. 505-G.-IV-3 OF 1913. From J. G. CATTELL, ESQUIRE, I.C.V.D., Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Sind, Baluchistán and Rájputána ; To THE UNDER SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. Karáchi, dated 28th June 1913. (Through the Commissioner in Sind, Karáchi.) Sir, I have the honour to submit, for the information of His Excellency the Governor in Council, the Annual Administration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department in Sind, for the official year 1912-13. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, J. G. CATTELL, I. C. V. D., Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Sind, Baluchistán and Rájputána.
43 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT IN SIND, FOR THE YEAR 1912-1913. GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. Mr. J. G. Cattell held charge of the office of the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Sind, Baluchistán and Rájputána, throughout the year. Mr. Cattell was on tour in Sind for 124 days and travelled 4,046 miles by rail and 895 miles by road*. He made an extensive tour with tents in the Thar and Párkar, Hyderabad, Nawábsháh and Lárkána Districts, inspected all the dispensaries in the province once or more than once; and where necessary selected sites for others. He, when possible, personally attended outbreaks of contagious disease and checked inoculation work. I.44 Preventive inoculations, vide Table III. Nine hundred and forty-six inoculations were performed in 12 outbreaks, against 1,386 inoculations performed last year in the course of 12 outbreaks. Foot and Mouth Disease.45 Vide Table V.46 It was impossible to secure competent Veterinary Assistants for the dispensaries at Sujával and Tatta in the Karachi District on the sanctioned pay of Rs. 30 plus a special allowance of Rs. 15 per mensem and Government sanctioned an additional special allowance of Rs. 25 per mensem, from the resources of the District Local Board, for each post. As reported last year the present method of reporting epidemic disease and collecting statistics is very unsatisfactory and proposals for an improved system of reporting disease have been submitted to the Commissioner in Sind. The Superintendent regrets to have to report that interest in the working of veterinary dispensaries is lacking in some cases on the part of members of the dispensary committee. J. G. CATTELL, I. C. V. D., Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Sind, Baluchistán and Rájputána.
