?CHOLERA IN INDIA, 1862 TO 1881.  BENGAL PROVINCE. Geographical position.-The Province of Bengal, or Lower Bengal as it is also called, comprises the lower valleys and deltas of the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Mahanadi rivers, and lies between 19 18' and 28 15' north latitude and between 82 and 97 east longitude. Excluding Assam, which was erected into a separate administration in February 1874, the Bengal Province now includes the four great divisions of Bengal Proper, Behar, Orissa, and Chota Nagpur. Its divisions, districts, area, and population are shown in the annexed tabular statement. The Bengal Province is the largest and most populous of the Provincial Governments of British India, contains one-third of the total population of British India, and yields a gross revenue of about one-third of the aggregate revenues of the Indian Empire. But its cholera statistics are the most meagre and the least reliable of those of any province under British administration in India. The Bengal Province is bounded on the north by Assam, Bhutan, and Nepal; on the east by the unexplored mountain- ous region which separates it from China and Northern Burma; on the south by Burma, the Bay of Bengal, and Madras; and on the west by an imagin- ary line running between it and the adjoining local Government of the North- Western Provinces, and by the plateau of the Central Provinces. Of the four great divisions of the Bengal Province, Bengal Proper, Behar, and Orissa consist of great river valleys, while the fourth, Chota Nagpur, is a mountainous region which separates them from the Central India plateau. Orissa embraces the rich delta of the Mahanadi and the neighbouring rivers, bounded by the Bay of Bengal on the south-east, and walled in on the north- west by tributary hill states. Proceeding eastward, Bengal Proper stretches along the coast from Orissa to British Burma, and inland from the sea-board to the Himalayas; its southern portion is formed by the united deltas of the Ganges and Brahmaputra; its northern consists of the valleys of these great rivers and their tributaries. Behar lies on the north-west of Bengal Proper, and comprises the higher valley of the Ganges, from the spot where it issues from the territory of the North-Western Provinces. Between Behar and Orissa, but streching further westward, and deep into the hill country, lies the Chota Nagpur territory. Physical aspects.-The territory thus hemmed in, except at its north- western angle, by the unchangeable landmarks of nature, consists chiefly of two broad valleys. By the western one the Ganges brings down the wealth and the accumulated waters of Northern India. By the eastern valley the Brahmaputra, after draining the Tibetan plateau far to the north of the Himalayas, and skirting round their passes not far from the Yang-tse-Kiang and the great river of Cambodia, ends its tortuous journey of 1,800 miles. These valleys, although for the most part luxuriant alluvial plains, are diversified by spurs and peaks thrown out from the great mountain systems which wall them in on the north-east and south-west. They yield in abund- ance every vegetable product which feeds and clothes a people and enables it to trade with foreign nations. The soil is equally varied. The districts near the sea consist entirely of alluvial formations; and, indeed, it is stated that no substance so coarse as gravel occurs throughout the delta, or in the heart of the province within 300 miles of the river mouths. But amid the hilly spurs and undulations on either side, coal, iron, and copper ores abound. Climate.-The climate varies from the snowy regions of the Himalayas, to the tropical vapour bath of the delta and the burning winds of Behar. The ordinary range of the thermometer on the plains is from about 52F. in the coldest month to 103 in the shade in summer; anything below 60F. is considered very cold. The rainfall also varies greatly from 500 to B
?(   2    ) 600 inches per annum  at Cherrapunji in Assam to an average   of about 37 inches in Behar and about 65 inches on the delta. Food-supply.-The prices of common food differ much at the central marts and in the isolated tracts of the interior. At present in Bengal and Behar hamlets a rupee will ordinarily purchase 20 to 25 sers of common rice, and in Orissa from 25 to 30 sers. During the last generation it would have purchased 40 sers, and in the generation before that, 60 sers and upwards. In Calcutta itself, a rupee will seldom purchase more than 16 sers of common rice. In Behar, however, maize and other cereals besides rice are consumed, and of these a rupee will purchase as much as 35 sers. The wages of labour may be generally stated at 1 to 2 annas (11/2 to 3d.) a day in Behar, 2 annas (3d ) in Orissa, 3 annas (41/2d) in Northern Bengal, 4 annas (6d.) in Central Bengal, 5 annas (71/2d) in Eastern Bengal, and 4 to 6 annas (6d. to 9d.) in Calcutta. During the last generation the rates ranged from 1 anna to 3 annas at the highest, the lowest being the generally prevalent rate. On the whole the wages of labour have risen in proportion to the prices of common food. Behar.-This great division of the Bengal Province lies between 23 49' and 27 19' north latitude and between 83 22' and 88 35' east longitude,and comprises the 10 districts of Patna, Sarun, Gya, Shahabad, Tirhoot, Chumparun, Santhal, Bhagulpur, Monghyr, and Purneah. The country generally is flat, except in the district of Monghyr, where detached hills occur, and in the south-east, where the Rajmehal and Santhal ranges abut upon the plains. The highest hill is Moher, 1,620 feet, in Gya district; the range in the Santhal district varies from 800 to 1,600 feet in height. The great river is the Ganges, which entering at Buxar and leaving at Rajmehal, divides Behar into two almost equal portions. Both portions are watered by large tributaries of the Ganges, the chief of these being the Gogra, the Gandak, the Kusi, the Mahanadi in the north, and the Sone in the south. The physical features of the country will be found described separately with the several districts composing it. Chota or Chutia Nagpur.-This great division of the Bengal Province lies between 21 58' 30" and 24 28' north latitude and between 83 22' and 87 15' east longitude and is bounded on the north by the districts of Mirzapur, Shahabad, and Gya; on the east by the districts of Monghyr, Santhal, Bankura, and Midnapur; on the south by the Orissa Tributary States; and on the west by the Sambalpur district of the Central Provinces and the independent state of Rewah. This division comprises the British districts of Hazaribagh, Lohardaga, Singbhum, Manbhum, and seven Tributary states. The description of the country is given separately with each of its several districts. Orissa.-This division lies between 19 28' and 22  34'  15"  north lati- tude and  between  83  63' 30" and 7  31' 30" east longitude, and comprises the districts of Cuttack, Balasore, Puri, and hill  states.    It forms the extreme south-western portion of the Bengal Province, and is bounded on the  north and north-east by Chota Nagpur and Bengal Proper; on the east and south-east by the  Bay  of Bengal; on the  south  by  Madras; and on the west by the Central Provinces.    Orissa consists of two distinct territories-a fertile alluvial delta, comprising the three British districts of Cuttack,   Balasore, and  Puri, bounded on the east and south by the sea  and. on  the west and north by a wild rigion of sparsely populated tributary hill states, which walls it out from the Central Indian plateau.    The Orissa delta is formed from the  deposits  of three great rivers, the Mahanadi on the south, the Brahmani in the centre, and the Baitarni on the north.    The three  rivers gradually converge  towards the  coast and  dash down  their accumulated waters within 30 miles of each other  upon  Orissa.    During summer their upper channels in  the  interior table-land dwindle to insignificant streams, dotted  here and there by stagnant almond-shaped pools.    Including two other  minor streams, the  Salandi and Subanrekha,  they represent the accumulated drainage of 63,350 square miles, which during the height of the hot weather only amounts to a discharge of 1,690 cubic feet per second.    The average cold-weather drainage is,  however, 5,360 cubic feet per second, but during the rains the rivers rise till they bring down an aggregate of 2,760,000 cubic feet in  time  of flood.    This  enormous mass of water falls  suddenly upon a  narrow level  strip  of country.    The
(    3    ) river beds  are  altogether inadequate to carry off the flood.    Thus, while the Mahanadi alone pours down 1,800,000 cubic feet per second  in the height  of the rains, the whole of its distributaries in the Orissa delta can only  discharge 897,449 cubic feet per second.    It follows, therefore, that only one half of the waters thus brought down find an outlet through the deltaic distributaries to the sea.    The other half bursts over the banks, and sweeps across the  country. "The Mahanadi," as pointed out by Dr.   Hunter in  his   Orissa,   "illustrates in  a striking manner  the biography of a  great Indian river."    Rising in Central India, 520 miles off, it collects the rainfall of 45,000  square  miles, and  pours  down  on  the  Orissa delta through  a narrow  gorge just above Cuttack city.    In its first stage it runs on a lower level than the surrounding country, winding  through mountain passes and skirting the base of the  hills. During this long part of its career it receives innumerable tributaries from the higher country on both banks.  So far it answers to our common English idea of a river.   But no sooner does it reach the  delta than its  whole life changes. Instead of running along the lowest ground, it finds itself hoisted upon its own deposits of silt, its banks gradually forming ridges, which rise above the adjacent country.    Instead of receiving affluents, it shoots forth distributaries.    The silt gradually accumlates in the bed and on its margins, until its channel shallows and its capacity as an outlet for  the waters  which  pour  into  it from above diminishes.   The same process goes on in every one of the hundred distributaries into which the parent stream breaks up;  and as the beds grow more shallow, their total discharging power becomes less and less adequate to carry off the water-supply to the  sea.    As  the  rivers  in the  delta thus  gradually   build themselves up   into   high-level   canals  so  the  lowest levels lie about half way between each set  of their distributaries.    The  country,  in fact, slopes gently  downward from the river banks, and in time of flood   the overflow is  unable to make its way back  again  into the  river.    The waters stand deep  upon the harvest fields long  after  the main channels have run down. They   slowly   search    out   the lines   of   drainage,    accumulating   in   stag- nant  swamps,   drowning the   crops,   and  poisoning  the  air  with malaria, until they dry up, or at last reach the sea.  Even  in periods   of quiescence the rivers form a  complicated net-work of channels,   which crawl  eastward by  innumerable  bifurcations, interlacings,   and  temporary  rejunctions  and divergencies,"    Besides the copious water-supply, Orissa  has  a local rainfall of 621/2 inches  per   annum.    Nevertheless,   the  uncontrolled  state    of   the water-supply has subjected the country from time immemorial to  droughts no less than to inundations. The tributary hill states of Orissa, 19 in number, which form the mountainous back ground of this division of the Bengal Province, occupy a succession of ranges rolling backwards towards Central India. They furnish no cholora statistics, and therefore require no description here. B 2
?( 4 ) BENGAL PROVINCE, 1862. There are no statistics to show the monthly prevalence of cholera among the civil populaiton in 1862.

?(    8    ) BENGAL PROVINCE, 1864. As a result of the recommendations of the Royal Commission appointed to enquire into the sanitary state of the Army in India in 1859, the Sanitary Commission of Bengal was instituted in 1864, and for the first time measures were taken for the systematic registering of deaths in Calcutta, but the results were of so imperfect a kind as to be useless for statistical purposes. The only class of the native population for which any statistics of the prevalence of cholera in 1864 are available is, that of the prisoners in jails, and the troops of the native army also furnish statistics in the same direction. From the returns of deaths registered in Calcutta during the last nine months of 1864 it appears that a total of 2,975 deaths were attributed to cholera out of a population estimated at about 400,000 or 500,000. Of these deaths, 2,169 were of males and 806 of females ; 121 occurred among Christians-92 males and 29 females ; 2,177 among Hindus-1,562 males and 615 females ; and 677 among Musalmans-515 males and 162 females. It has been shown by Dr. Hugh Macpherson that during the 20 years ending with 1860, cholera has never been absent from Calcutta. Of the prevalence of the disease in the districts of the Bengal Province no statistics are available. In the annexed summary statements is shown the prevalence of cholera among the European and native troops, and the prisoners in jails in the Bengal Province for the year 1864. It will be seen from the number of stations affected that the disease was very generally diffused throughout the province, as in the two preceding years for which we have given the records. Among the European troops-total average strength 4,308-there were altogether 20 admissions and 10 deaths from cholera, giving a death-rate of 2.32 per mille of strength. Of the stations occupied by the European troops, the 4 following recorded cholera in 1864 :-(this is exclusive of Kidderpore Hospital and Chinsura Dept, in which there were 9 admissions and 6 deaths).

Of the 20 admissions there were 3 in February, 1 in March, 5 in April, 1 in May, 5 in July, 1 in August, 2 in October, and 2 in December. Among the native troops-total average strength 7,907-there were alto- gether 89 admissions and 38 deaths, giving a death-rate of 4.80 per mille of strength.

The returns of the Bhutan force are only for the months of November and December. Of the 89 admis- sions there were 2 in March, 13 in April, 30 in May, 9 in June, 5 in July, 5 in August, 2 in September, 5 in October, 14 in November, and 4 in December. Among the jail populations-total average strength 15,344-there were altogether 615 admissions and 210 deaths from cholera, giving a death-rate of

Of the 615 admissions there were 6 in January, 47 in February, 145 in March, 243 in April, 72 in May, 34 in June, 14 in July, 10 in August, 7 in September, 9 in October, 16 in November, and 12 in December. Taking all the figures together, the monthly prevalence of the disease is shown on the accompanying diagram. On the cholera map for 1864 are marked the districts above shown to have been affected by the disease. The incidence of cholera of 1864 among the troops and jails in Bengal Province was considerably less than in the preceding year, but more consi- derably greater than in the year before that. It more closely resembled in point of frequency the cholera of 1861. The figures representing admissions in each year from cholera among the troops and prison populations in the Bengal Province for the four-yearly period ending 1864 are here reproduced, with the figures for 1861 added for sake of comparison:- Years. Troops. Prisoners. Total. 1861 162 588 740 1862 ... 79 367 446 1863 ... 75 1,007 1,082 1864 ...                ...                 109 615 724 The figures for the troops include the Europeans and natives. The incidence of cholera among the troops and prisoners in jails is in no degree an index to the actual prevalence of the disease among the civil population of the same localities or districts. Cholera, as has often been observed, may be raging with great fatality in a district or even in a town without affecting the troops or prisoners dwelling in the same place. On the other hand, it is very rare for the troops and prisoners to be affected by cholera without its being at the same time more or less prevalent among the civil population. Meteorology- c

(11) BENGAL PROVINCE, 1865. There are no statistics available to show the monthly prevalence of cholera among the civil population in 1865. The army and jail returns show some of the places in which cholera was present in this year. Among the European troops-total average strength 5,050-there were altogether 24 admissions and 17 deaths from cholera, giving a death-rate of 3.37 per mille of strength. Of the nine stations occupied by European troops, the six following recorded cholera in 1865 :- Fort William Strength        789 Admissions        1 Deaths    1 Dum-Dum " 717 " 13 " 10 Barrackpore " 357 " 1 " 1 Berhampore " 147 " 1 " 1 Bhutan Force " 145 " 5 " 3 Dinapore " 1,062 " 3 " 1 The strength of the affected troops is 3,217, the percentage of admissions to strength 0.74, and of deaths to admissions 71. Of the 24 admissions there were 1 in March, 1 in April, 15 in May, 1 in July, 1 in October, 1 in November and 3 in December. Among the native troops--total average strength 9,488--there were altogether 275 admissions and 150 deaths from cholera, giving a death-rate of 15.81 per mille of strength. Of the eight stations occupied by the native troops the five following recorded cholera in 1865 :-- Calcutta Strength    1,287 Admissions 38 Deaths   17 Barrackpore " 778 " 12 " 8 Dacca                        " 466 " 24 " 8 Bhutan Force           " 5,084 " 191 " 113 Bhagalpur                    " 358 " 10 " 5 The strength of the affected troops is 7,973, the percentage of admissions to strength 3.45, and of deaths to admissions 54. Of the 275 admissions there were 2 in January, 9 in February, 7 in March, 67 in April, 81 in May, 42 in June, 10 in July, 8 in August, 9 in September, 10 in October, 24 in Novem- ber, and 6 in December. Among the jail populations--total average strength 17,328-there were altogether 415 admissions and 155 deaths from cholera, giving a death-rate of 8.94 per mille of strength. Of the 46 jails in the province, no less than 30 recorded cholera in 1865 : - Alipore Strength    1,811  Admissions 66 Deaths 25 Baraset                       " 122 " 5 " 3 Kishnagarh " 333 " 2 " 1 Howrah " 152 " 4 " 1 Hugli " 578 " 15 " 6 Bardwan " 487 " 5 " 0 Bankura " 480 " 30 " 8 Raniganj " 28 " 2 " 0 Rajmahal " 136 " 12 " 4 Deogarh " 79 " 2 " 1 Dinajpur             " 443 " 2 " 2 Rajshahi        " 425 " 2 " 0 Mymansingh " 418 " 4 " 2 Pubna " 136 " 15 " 3 Bakirganj            " 407 " 13 " 1 Chittagong " 304 " 2 " 2 Dacca " 474 " 2 " 0 Midnapur " 616 " 2 " 0 Balasore " 227 " 1 " 0 Puri " 77 " 5 " 3 Ranchi " 279 " 15 " 9 Hazaribagh " 626 " 1 " 0 Monghyr " 378 " 13 " 6 Bhagalpur " 341 " 6 " 1 Purniah " 420 " 44 " 23 Patna                 " 433 " 33 " 14 Digah " 419 " 36 " 15 Arrah " 433 " 2 " 0 Muzaffarpur " 477 " 1 " 1 Chaprah " 484 " 73 " 24 c 2
?(   12   ) The strength of the affected jails is 12,023, the percentage of admissions to strength 3.45, and of deaths to admissions  37. Of the 415 admissions there were 5 in January, 7 in February, 22 in March, 138 in April, 23 in May, 21 in June, 41 in July, 24 in August, 21 in September, 74 in October, 36 in November, and 3 in December. Taking all the figures together, the monthly prevalence of the disease is shown on the accompanying diagram. On the map are marked the districts above shown to have been affected with cholera in 1865. From the above data the cholera of 1865 in this province appears to have been very generally distributed over its whole area. But the statistics of cholera among the troops and jail populations afford no correct indication of the prevalence of the disease among the civil populations. For instance, the cholera mortality in the jails of the Orissa districts, viz., Balasore 1 admis- sion only and no death, and Pooree 5 admissions and 3 deaths, hardly indicates much prevalence of the disease. In 1865 the rainfall in the Lower Provinces was generally capricious, irregular, and scanty. The fall in inches registered at the Surveyor-General's Office, Calcutta, is shown in the subjoined statement in comparison with that of the preceding year and the monthly average of the five years from 1860 to 1864 : -     Months.

December 0.09 0.00 ? Total 72.13 84.22 61.58 The deficiency of the fall up to end of October in 1865 is thus shown to be no less than 10.55 inches as compared with the average of the previous five years for the same period, that is 61.58 against 72.13. The figures also show an excess of 15.27 inches during the first five months of the year as compared with the same average fall in those months, that is 9.25 inches against 24.52, and a deficiency in the hot weather monsoon rainfall, in the months of June to October of 25.73 inches, that is 37.06 inches against the average of 62.79. Throughout the year the rainfall was remarkably local and partial, rain having, for instance, repeatedly fallen in Chowringhee and not in the town of Calcutta, and vice vers. In some parts of the country, as Faridpur, Pubna, Tipperah, and parts of Hugli district it was alleged that the crops were drowned in the early rains. This would seem to shew that the rainfall statistics of Calcutta may be taken as a fair guide to the rain- fall of the provinces generally. In the subjoined statement are shown the prices of the principal food- grains in sers per rupee from the 20th to 25th November 1865 together with the ordinary prices at that season in the several districts of the Bengal Province.

In Balsore and that part of the country the distress was less severe; yet the whole division was sorely afflicted by famine, more especially during the latter half of the year, and the mortality from cholera, although not registered, was known to be severe in some parts. In the Manbhum and Singbhum districts of the Chota Nagpur Division the famine also pressed very severely, and the mortality in them from starvation and other diseases, including cholera, was not far short of what occurred in Orissa, yet the only indications of the presence of the disease in this division, which are afforded by the jail returns, are a single admission and no death in the Hazaribagh jail, and an outbreak with 15 admissions and 7 deaths in the Ranchi Jail, in the Lohardugga district. In the the south-east part of the Manbhum district rice was selling at 31/2 to 41/2 sers the rupee at the end of August, the average price for the district being 32 sers the rupee in July of the preceding year. "And early in September it was recorded, as the opinion of the Relief Committee, that about Barra Bazaar one-fourth of the population was dead, and another fourth dying." In the Singbhum district the famine was severest in its north-east part. The drought had been worst in the Dhalbhum sub-division, and here the price of rice rose in September to 16 or 20 sers the rupee, which was far above its price in the rest of the district. In the Midnapur district the eastern and southern parts suffered severely from the great irruption of the sea caused by the cyclone of October 1864, and in the western part, or Jungle Mehal, the rice crop of 1865 was a failure, as also were the cold-weather cereal crops of 1865-66. The hot-weather rains of 1865 broke unusually early, and no fall of any consequence occurred later than the 15th September. This autumn drought, succeeding the inundations of the preceding year, pressed the poorer classes to extremity for food, especially in the Hidgli sub-division, where the price of rice, which in October ranged from 12 to 16 sers the rupees, was quite beyond their means. The only indication afforded by the Midnapur jail returns of the presence of cholera in this district is in two admissions and no death from that disease.

?(    15    ) BENGAL PROVINCE, 1866. There are no statistics to show the monthly mortality from cholera among the civil population in 1866. The army and jail returns show some of the places in which cholera was prevalent in this year. Among the European troops-total average strength 4,381-there were altogether 28 admissions and 18 deaths from cholera, giving a death-rate of 4.11 per mille of strength. Of the nine stations occupied by European troops, the five following recorded cholera in 1866 (exclusive of Kidderpore hospital and Chinsura dept, strength(?), which recorded four admissions and four deaths) : - Fort William Strength     861 Admissions     4 Deaths     2 Dum-Dum " 680 " 3 " 2 Darjiling " 491 " 1 " 1 Hazaribagh                     " 806 " 19 " 13 Dinapore " 892 " 1 " 0 The strength of the affected troops is 3,730, the percentage of admis- sions to strength 0.75, and of deaths to admissions 64.

Taking all the figures together, the monthly prevalence of the disease is shown in the accompanying diagram. The districts shown above to be affected with cholera in 1866 are marked on the map for that year. The cholera of 1866 in the Bengal Province was coincident with a famine in many parts of the country. The incidence of the disease among the jail populations approaches in severity to the cholera of 1863 among the same classes of the people. The figures clearly illustrate the manner in which cholera mortality is aggravated by famine and a distressed condition of the people. Throughout Bengal Proper cholera was generally prevalent in 1866. It was confined to no particular season, but was generally most severe in January, and again in the end of the year. The time at which it appears to have reached its height varied, however, in different districts. In Balasore, for example, it prevailed from January to June ; in Monghyr the most severe epidemic was in August. Throughout  the famine tracts it raged with most virulence, and to this disease, with dysentery and diarrha, a great part of the lamentable  mortality is to be ascribed.    In the  opinion  of Dr.  Sheridan, the Civil Surgeon  of Birbhum, the extraordinary causes which favoured the spread of these diseases, and which were in  operation  over great part of the provinces were,  first, "A great death of food among the people, owing to a failure in the rice crops, amounting  in some parts of the district to actual famine and starvation ; *** second, bad drinking water,  owing to  the  early  cessation  of the  rains  in September, and the long-protracted drought which followed, continuing up to the first fall of rain in the middle of June, in consequence of which all  the  tanks of moderate  depth became partially or wholly dried up, rendering any water remaining  in  them  impure and  unfit  for  drinking;   ***   third,   exposure to vicissitudes of weather and extremes of temperature at the most inclement and unhealthy  seasons of the year,  owing to inability from extreme poverty to  procure warm clothing or covering.   Want of shelter, too, on the part of large numbers of the poor, whose miserable huts had been destroyed by  the unusually  heavy falls of rain which occurred in the months of June and July, and where not totally destroyed, inability to re-thatch fallen-in roofs  owing to  the  great  scarcity and dearness of straw;  fourth, innundations from the overflowing of rivers, which cause great loss  and damage to large numbers living near  them, in many instances destroying the small quantities of grain that had been rescued from  the previous  year's  scanty harvest ;  fifth, con- sumption  of new  rice  by large numbers who had  been for months previous suffering from chronic starvation." "Most of the medical officers,"  writes the  Sanitary Commissioner for Bengal, "from whom replies have been received, have expressed their belief

(17) that cholera, as it came under their observation, had not been propagated by contagion. They generally ascribed it to local causes, the precise nature of which we have yet to ascertain. The force and direction of the wind have not been observed to influence its spread." The Civil Surgeon of Dacca, in which district the disease was more than usually severe during 1866, and caused the death of 3,000 persons, remarks: "It is certain that its course was not directed by the wind but by the khalls (canals) and roads. "The Civil Surgeon of Dibrugarh states that the disease moved up to that distirct from Bengal in direct opposition to the north-east wind." In the Bankura district the price of rice had been high  throughout the year 1865 as compared with the previous years.    In   January the  price was 25  sers  for  the rupee instead  of 31 or 32 sers, which is the usual price in that month.    In  August the price  was 22  sers  as  against 32  of previous years,  and in  September it suddenly rose to 15 sers.    In January 1866 the same price ruled.    In February a violent outbreak of cholera took  place at Bishanpur,  an old and decaying town about 20 miles to the south-east of the civil station, and early in March the deaths fell  to   11  per  diem.    "When the cholera burst out, the people of Bishanpur, paralysed by panic and poverty- stricken to such a degree that they could not pay the  cost  of burning  their dead,  threw down the  corpses just  outside the  town.     Prompt measures were taken for removal of them, and cholera  was  checked."    In September, however, the disease again broke out in this town,  and apparently continued rife in  October.    The  famine distress  extended in  a lesser degree than at Bishanpur over the south and west of the  district.    But in July  the  Relief Committee recorded "there is  actually no rice in the Bankura bazar, and the people are entirely supported at present by the rice which they purchase daily from the Committee, imported by the Committee from Calcutta.    The  market price at this time was 8 sers the  rupee.    In October the early crop had come into the market and brought down the price to 12 sers the rupee. Meteorology.-The Meteorological Reporter for Bengal having only recently, on the creation of that appointment and office, entered on his duties, no information is available from his office regarding the meteorological phenomena of 1866. The following tabular statement is compiled from the data contained in the Sanitary Reports of Civil Surgeons regarding temper- ature and rainfall of 1866 as compared with previous years. "The stations have been selected as illustrating different portions of the large extent of country embraced in Bengal, and because the observations have been recorded by the medical officers themselves."

?(20) Food-supply.-In Bengal, rice boiled in water forms the principal article of diet of the people, and in many cases the only food taken, dl, fish, and vegetables are added to give relish and flavour to it. * * * Twelve chittacks of rice is an ordinary daily allowance for a healthy man-seven chittacks are usually taken in the forenoon and five in the evening. Boatmen and others often consume 14 chittacks. * * * Wheat is not generally used by Bengalis except in sweetmeats. The Mahomedans in the town consume fermented bread prepared by professional bakers. Various kinds of cakes and biscuits are sold. Natives of Hindustan generally fall into the habits of the Bengalis and make rice the chief article of their diet. Those, however, who can afford to, cook chappattes, or unfermented bread. Mahomedans eat all sorts of meat with the excep- tion of swine. Hindus use animal food very sparingly. Goat's flesh can be eaten. * * * Pigeons, ducks, and their eggs can be eaten without losing caste. The poor often eat turtle also. About 2 chittacks of dl form an ingredient of almost every meal. * * * The poor being unable to buy both dl and fish on one day, generally take them alternately. Milk, simply boiled or acidulated (dahi), is much used. Butter is not esteemed. Ghee (clarified butter) is universally employed in cooking vegetables and dl, which are eaten with the rice. Sweetmeats are always fried in ghee. Rice and milk with sugar (parmanun) and spices added is considered a great delicacy, and forms the last dish of the meal. This, however, is only partaken of on rare occasions. In the city of Dacca English vegetables are bought in the bazar, and are highly valued by the richer classes. Potatoes from Cherrapunji find a ready sale. * * *Native vegetables are generally cooked with ghee, mustard oil or a mixture of it and til oil, salt, capsicum, acid fruits, new leaves, &c. * * * Every native adds about 1 kutcha (6 drachams ) of salt to his meal. The poorer classes add a mixture consisting of turmeric, laurel-leaf, chilies, cummin; occasionally onion, garlic, and coriander enter into the composition of the seasoning, Fish of endless variety are sold in the bazars. They are cheapest during the cold season, scarce and expensive during the rains. Fish are generally fried in oil, with salt, turmeric, and spices, and are eaten along with rice and vegetables. * * * The mango is held in the highest estimation during the season, no meal is considered complete without it; kuthal or jack-fruit is the next in popularity. It is eatn raw, or its juice is mixed with milk and drunk in the hot weather. The cocoanut is much prized. * * * The date fruit is small and tasteless; from its juice, however, molasses is made. Bael is chefly used in the form of sherbet. Plantains are highly valued, and are a favourite viand. The sour plums of the ber (zizyphus jujuba) are much sought after by the poorer classes. Oranges and sweet-limes are imported from Sylhet, and are largely consumed. In July pine-apples sell as cheap as two for one pice. Papaya, guavas, cucumbers, water- melons, &c., find a ready sale. * * * The singhara-nuts, though less common than in Hindustan, sell here at two pice a seer, large quantities are sold towards the beginning of the cold season. (The report of Dr. Wise, Civil Surgeon of Dacca). Throughout the year 1866 prices of food ruled high in Bengal. In Orissa a grievous famine desolated the land. In Midnapur and throughout Behar there was great scarcity, and consequently much distress among the people. In districts where a full harvest had been gathered exportation of rice to the famine districts produced high prices in them also. In Dacca, for example, the crops of 1866 are reported on the whole to have been good and yet famine prices prevailed during several months of the year.* * * The following table will show the enormous rise in prices of grain in this district-a rise which must have terribly curtailed the food of the poor. The three common kinds of rice in former years sold as follows in comparison with the prices in 1866:- KINDS OF RICE.

(21) The rains of 1865 throughout the Lower Provinces of the Bengal Presidency ceased prematurely in the middle of September. Speaking generally, it may be said that no rain of any consequence fell after the middle of the  month. A portion of the Madras coast, to the south-west of Bengal, was also similarly affected. The total quantity of the rainfall for the year was not unusually small in most of the districts of Bengal, but it fell abnormally and out of time. Much rain fell early in the season before the usual time for sewing had arrived and when its continuance could not be depended on, while the latter rains, which are usually expected in the end of September and October, failed. Speaking still in general terms of the countries on the northern coast of the Bay of Bengal, it may be said that the rains, brought by the south-west monsoon, commence earlier and fall in greater quantity and more regularly to the east, and diminish both in quantity and still more in regu- larity towards the west, so that the eastern countries are altogether more humid than those to the west. Rice is the staple of all these countries. And the same crop which in the more humid districts of the east ripened in 1865, notwithstanding the unusually early cessation of the rains, was prematurely cut off in the drier and tardier districts of the west; the more so as it seems that in part of Orissa the total fall was much below the average, and the period from June to the middle of September was especially deficient prior to the total cessation of rain from the last-mentioned date. (Report of Special Commissioners on Orissa Famine quoted by Sanitary Commissioner for Bengal.)  "During 1866, throughout Orissa, the average price of rice varied from 13 sers in January to 5 sers, and even less than 5 sers in August.* * * In Behar and throughout the Sonthal Pergu\ill\ahas also famine was widely spread, and there was great distress among the people. In these parts of the country it has been computed that during 1866 no less than 135,676 persons perished from starvation or disease engendered by want."
?(   22   ) BENGAL PROVINCE 1867. No statistics are available to show the monthly prevalence of cholera among the civil population of this province in 1867. The army and jail returns show some of the places where cholera was present in this year. Among the European troops-total average strength 14,162-there were altogether 7 admissions and 6 deaths from cholera, giving a death-rate of 1.44 per mille of strength. Of the nine stations occupied by European troops, the five following recorded cholera in 1867 :- Fort William        Strength     739 Admissions       3 Deaths 2 Dum-Dum  472  1  1 Barrackpore  357  1  1 Hazaribagh  876  1  1 Dinapore      907  1  1 The strength of the affected troops is 3,351, the percentage of admissions to strength 0.21, and of deaths to admissions 86.

Cholera in Bengal Province during the year 1867. Lithographed at the Survey of India Offices, Calcutta, November 1884.
(23) The strength of the affected jails is 11,828, the percentage of admissions to strength 3.07, and of deaths to admissions 45. Of the 363 admissions there were 5 in January, 2 in February, 53 in March, 57 in April, 74 in May, 4 in June, 49 in July, 20 in August, 56 in September, 9 in October, 28 in Novem- ber, and 6 in December. Taking all the figures together, the monthly prevalence of the disease is shown in the accompanying diagram. The districts shown to be affected by cholera in 1867 are marked on the map for that year. From the above returns it appears that the cholera of 1867 in the Bengal Province was much less prevalent than in the preceding year. In 1866, as in 1863, cholera seems to have prevailed with considerable epidemic force all over the Bengal Province. In 1867 the disease appears to have subsided to its ordinary rate of prevalence, at least as concerns its annual incidence, among the troops and jails in the province. Meteorology.-

?(25)  BENGAL PROVINCE, 1868. There are no statistics available to show the monthly prevance of cholera among the civil population of this province for the year 1868. In this year the office of Sanitary Commissioner for the Bengal Province was created. From the first annual report of the Sanitary Commissioner for Bengal for 1868, the following particulars regarding the prevalence of cholera in the province for that year are gathered:-"The Bengal Province, or Lower Provinces of the Bengal Presidency, comprises Bengal Proper, Behar, and Orissa." The Civil Surgeon of Howrah writes:-"Cholera is endemic, it also occurs epidemically; *** diarrha very prevalent." The population is estimated at above 564,000, and its density at about 1,025 to the square mile. On an average the sub-soil water is found at the depth of about 12 feet from the surface. No wells are used in the district. Tanks are numerous. Cholera prevails more at the beginning of the hot and cold seasons than at other times. The Civil Surgeon of Hugli writes:-"In this district fever  of a  severe intermittent type is of an endemic nature, its attacks are confined  mostly  to the commencement and breaking up of the rains,  and  also to  the beginning of the winter months, and to the periods of the reaping  of the rice-crops.*** Cholera   shows   itself   at  times  in   a  severe   form;  frequently it is  of a sporadic nature, directly traceable to exposure to damp and bad   food."***The population of the district is estimated  at  1,600,000,  and  its  density  to  the square mile at about 1,100.    Some times the Damudah inundates the  country and greatly enriches the soil, but  as  a rule the  inundations  are  disastrous; both man and beast, and even entire villages are apt to  be  swept away in a few hours.    Water is found in the dry season between 18 and 20  feet, and  in the rainy weather between 7 and  8  feet below  the surface.    "Wells are not used.    Tanks are numerous.    The few  wells  that  do  exist are  of masonry, from 20 to 40 feet deep, and generally  protected  by  railings or a low  wall. Jessore.-Cholera is believed to have prevailed more largely in the district subsequently to 1867 than previous to that year.    "Whether the disease  was, as it undoubtedly is now, an annual product, or at any  rate a  phenomenon of yearly occurrence to a greater or less extent, it is certain that in that year a most virulent visitation of cholera occurred, and  that ever since  then  the district has been the seat of virulent outbreaks  of the  disease.   Jessore  also participated, along with other districts adjoining, in the  outbreaks of the so- called epidmic fever which prevailed from 1860 to 1865.    Indeed, this peculiar manifestation of disease appears to have had its rise in  the  district."    In  the autumn of 1846 there was an outbreak of fever in Jessore station and the whole of the neighbouring district during the last week  of October and  the whole of the month of November.    The "amount  of sickness  and fever"  is described as "perfectly appaling, and disease was not only virulent  as regards the number who were attacked,  but the  mortality was most excessive.    In the city of Jessore, which contains a population of about  6,000 people,  about 10 deaths occurred it was computed daily; nearly three-fourths of the domestic servants and about the same number of the law  officers connected  with the law courts were laid up.    The European officers  suffered to  nearly the same extent; out of 33 European or Eurasian inhabitants, 22 were all under medical treatment during the month.    The  epidemic  from  which they  all suffered was a very peculiar description  of fever, which in   general  commenced as  a common quotidian intermittent, but which after the few  first  days,  from the 1st to 5th, assumed a continued type,  the remissions  or  intermissions  being scarcely perceptible and the cold stage being  merely  a  species  of transient horripilation and shivering, which only lasted a few  minutes,  which was followed by great heat of skin.    This  was  only occasionally followed by a cold, clammy  perspiration.    The  complications  which were  observed were principally of the head and chest, and as frequently of the latter as the former. There can be no doubt that the great amount of sickness was solely to be ascribed to the lateness of the rains and  the sudden drying up  of the river Bhyrab.' The Civil Surgeon of Jessore, Doctor Kenneth  McLeod, adduces the  above extract from an old report, because he is "certain that if a  similar outbreak were to occur now, the disease would be called ' epidemic fever, ' and to show \?\
?(26) that, as far back as 1846 exceptional outbreaks of malarious fever, in which the intermittent type was almost or completely merged in the continued have occurred. ***The inhabitants of this district have come to consider an outbreak of fever in the months of September, October, and November as a condition of their existence, and though fewer inhabitants of a village are free from it, and many succumb to its effects immediately or remotely, it is considered as the usual normal occurrence, and it is only exceptional outbreaks, such as that of 1846 and 1865, which arrest attention and arouse alarm."*** During the latter months of 1867 and earlier months of 1868 cholera was extensively prevalent in this district. It prevailed very generally all over the district, breaking out here and there without any apparent rule. Several thousand deaths occurred from this cause throughout the district. The disease appeared soon after the cyclone and while the waters of an unusually high inundation were rapidly subsiding. * * * The months of November, December, January, and February, were characterized by an almost complete absence of rain. In March and April, however, rain fell in frequent copious showers, and cholera abated and subsided in the course of three months. * * * The type of this cholera was not very severe, as the station was not visited with any degree of severity and the jail not at all. The district of Jessore is a portion of the delta of the river Ganges. The depth of the sub-soil water from the surface varies with the time of year, but generally water can always be found within a few feet of the surface. Wells are generally made of a series of earthenware cylinders fitted into each other and are from 20 to 30 feet deep. The depth of tanks averages about 15 feet. Cholera is an annual visitant of the Jessore district. It is apt to prevail in the months of March, April, and May, and in October and November. The visitations of the later months are not so general and the type of cases not so severe as in the earlier months; when cholera appears in the district, it breaks out simultaneously in different places, and no line of progress can be traced; generally its conduct is most eccentric; it will attack a portion of a village, a side of a bazar, a few inmates of a house, and no rule or law can be discovered in its origin or progress. Heavy falls of rain always check it, but if the rain is not sustained, it is apt to appear again with renewed vigour. Hot dry weather, with strong dusty winds, is the most favourable condition of its origin. The severity of cases varies greatly in different outbreaks, and the type of cases also varies as regards severity of cramps, &c. Twenty-two years in the Jessore Jail give the following figures:- Annual admissions per cent. of strength  34 Deaths per cent. of strength per annum  .95 Deaths par cent. of cases treated  276 Admissions per  cent. of total admissions 22 Deaths per cent. of total deaths   209 Admissions per cent. of strength in each month:- January .      06 February .     13 March .      81 April .      97 May .      57 June .      35 July   04 August   05 September  11 October   08 November  15 December  09 Diarrha precedes and accompanies cholera. There is also more or less diarrha always accompanying the annual outbreak of fever in October and November. The jail statistics for twenty-two years give the following results:- Admission per cent. of strength ...       113 Deaths per cent. of strength ...             65 Deaths per cent. of cases treated  58 Admissions per cent. of total admissions  71 Deaths per cent. of total deaths ...      143

The sub-soil water is found during the dry season at about 25 or 30 feet below the surface; tanks are numerous. Well-water is not considered good and the people avoid it. Berhampur.-Cholera generally visits Berhampur in October or Novem- ber, when the sand-banks in the river begin to dry up, and again in the months of March, April, and May. During the dry season 4 to 6 feet from the surface may be taken as the average depth of the sub-soil water at some distance from the river (the Bhagiratti), but during the rains the water in wells is almost on a level with the ground. Faridpur.- The climate of Faridpur, like that of Eastern Bengal, is excessively damp, but tolerably equable. By the end of June the greater part of the district is under water In the autumn months paludal fever of a bilious character more or less prevails. The heat is never excessive, and is by no means uncommon for a hot season to pass without the thermometer ranging above 86 or 87 in the shade, the air being cooled by southerly breezes. Sporadic cases of cholera are usually to be met with more or less in all parts of the district during this period. The depth of the sub-soil water from the surface varies from about 16 feet in winter to from 3 to 5 in summer. In the dry season graves may be 8 or 9 feet deep, but in the wet weather they may be only 4 feet. Burials take place generally in the same compound where the deceased lived. Bakirganj.-Cholera is endemic in the district, and is heard of and seen at all seasons except during the rains. *** Cholera usually makes its appearance at the commencement of the cold weather and also at the end of that season, at which times it has a tendency to become epidemic. *** About the months of March and April cholera generally makes its appearance in the Barrisal bazar. About this time the river is very low, and the water in the tanks has become very impure from the long droughts and the filthy habits of the people. It generally lasts up to the commencement of the rains. During the months of September and October fevers are very common.*** The climate of Barrisal is very damp at all seasons of the year. The cold weather sets in about the middle of November, and lasts up to the middle of February; it can never be said to be actually cold, and the bracing feeling experienced in Behar and the Upper Provinces never observable. The night air is chilly and raw, and the mornings generally very foggy. During the E2
?(28) middle of the day the sun's rays are very powerful. The cold season is thought very healthy by the natives, and numerous cases of sporadic cholera and fever make their appearance at this time of the year. The hot weather sets in about the end of February and terminates about the middle of June, when the rains commence. During the hot season frequent storms occur, which clear the atmosphere, and render it very pleasant and cool for a few days. The heat at Barrisal is never very oppressive, and the sea breeze, which gene- rally sets in about sunset, is very refreshing and conducive to health. The rains in the district are very copious. The whole country seems like a vast swamp, and the growth of vegetation proceeds with wonderful rapidity. The rainy season terminates generally about the middle of September, when the sea breeze lulls and the air becomes loaded with moisture and intolerably muggy. From this time to the setting in of the cold weather fevers are preva- lent among the natives, cholera is not usually heard of during the rainy season, and that is the only disease directly influenced by any particular season to a marked extent. All the other diseases prevail to a greater or less extent, quite irrespective of the season of the year. The sub-soil water is found at an average of 4 feet from the surface. The water-supply for the inhabitants is principally derived from tanks, of which nearly every ryot has one on his holding. Diarrha is a very common affection. It is usually accompanied by severe dyspepsia with flalutent distention of the bowels and stomach, causing considerable pain and distress. The people believe that this disease is caused by bad water, and certainly the water procurable in the Barrisal tanks is bad enough to cause any disease of the description; but the popular belief admits of doubt, inasmuch as the prisoners also suffer much from the disease, and they are never allowed to use any water that is not quite pure and carefully filtered. Dhaka or Dacca.-The following peculiarities regarding cholera are dedu- cible from the records of the various hospitals:-First, since cholera first appeared in an epidemic form in Dacca in August  1817, the disease  has not failed to appear  in the  city  during  each year up to 1868.   Second, April, November, December, and March are,  in  the  order named,  the most  sickly  months in the year.   In Calcutta cholera is most prevalent in April, March, May, February, and then November. Third, among the lunatics in the asylum the sickly months are November, December, October, and January, and of the deaths 20 per cent. takes place in those months.    Fourth, among the European residents 26 deaths have been registered during the last 13 years, of these 7 died in November, 6 in April, 4 in March, 3 in October, and  2 respectively in the  months  of June, August, and December. Fifth, late  rains and a slow  subsidence of the  inun- dations postpone  the  outburst  of cholera; an early cessation of the rains  is followed by an  early  outbreak of cholera.    In 1867  heavy rain fell  in the middle of November:  cholera did not break out till the end of December.    In 1868 the rains ceased by the 10th October:  cholera appeared in various parts of the  district, and  in Dacca about the 26th October.   Sixth, cholera is most prevalent at those seasons, when there is the  greatest   range of temperature as in April and November, and there appears to be a close connection between, the  attacks  and  exposure  to  chills, especially at night.   (Dr. J.  F.  Wise, Civil Surgeon, Dacca).    He also writes:-"There is one peculiarity about the epidemic cholera of Dacca, that only on rare occasions does  it  spread among the members of a household.    During 1868 these exceptional cases  were  more frequent than usual.    In the village of Goran, on the  1st Februry,   I  saw  6 members of one family in the colapse of cholera at the same time;  in  another house 3.  Early in August 4 people were attacked in one house in Dacca; in a second instance,  in another part of the town,  4 were also  attacked, and 2 died.    *** The cholera peculiar to Dacca is not  spread by  contagion. One school boy, living with 20 others in a room  which ought to contain only 10, is attacked with cholera, no disinfectants  are  used,  and no  measures  of cleanliness  are  enforced,  yet the  disease never  spreads  to any of the other inmates.    It is the general impression among the natives that it is not  comu- nicable from man to man."    Regarding the disposal  of the dead,  Dr.   Wise writes:-"In Dacca, within municipal boundaries,  there are  56 recognized Mahomedan burial-grounds.    The majority are in the  outskirts of the town and in the jungly tract  bounding the north and north-western suburbs;
?(   29   ) others,   however, are situated in the centre of densely inhabited places. * * * Throughout the district generally the dead are buried in the first waste piece of ground in the neighbourhood of the village.    The Hindu dead are burnt on the banks of some stream or watercourse.   When the deceased is   a beggar, and has no friends, the mouth is touched with fire, two ghurras filled with earth are fastened-one round the neck the other round the loins-and the body is thrown into the river.    A bamboo pole is driven through the belly into the bed of the river, so as to prevent its floating away.    Where the river has lofty banks, * * * the public ghts are selected as the fittest resting place for corpses.  The living, however,  have no  scruples in drawing water from the vicinity." Mymensingh.-* * Cholera may be considered endemic in this district; sporadic cases are of frequent occurence; occasionally the disease assumes the form of an epidemic. * * * For some years the disease has assumed an epidemic form, more or less severe, during the months of April and May. *  * * During the year 1868, cholera twice assumed an epidemic form,  during the months of April and May, and during the months  of October,  November, and December.    * * * During both epidemics the disease was almost  entirely confined to the poorer  classes of the community; sex appeared  to  exercise no influence, children were less frequently attacked than adults.  Epidemics in this district have generally lasted obout two months.* * Tipperah.- The whole district is under water during the months of June, July, August, September, and October. * * * Cholera, small-pox, and fevers prevail during the cold and hot seasons, the monsoon being the healthiest time of the year. * * * The whole district is eminently malarious. Drinking water is obtained from tanks chiefly. * * * The people drink water indiscriminately from tanks, rivers, and marshes. * * * No wells are used.*** Cholera is endemic in the station and district, and sometimes assumes an epidemic form. In this station an epidemic of cholera occurs every third year according to the statements of the oldest inhabitants, my experience confirms the above, an epidemic having occurred in 1863 and 1866. Noakhali.-Sub-soil water is found at a depth of 8 or 9 feet. No wells are used. Tanks are numerous and filthy. Cholera prevails more or less every year. Kushtia.-Dr. J. G. Grant, Civil Surgeon, writes:-"I believe cholera, like fever, to be endemic here, due to natural conditions of soil and climate intensified by neglected sanitation and favoured by poverty. The poor, especially those of most marshy parts, suffered earliest and most severely, without reference to caste. The epidemic of 1868 commenced in November 1867 and ended in May following; 2,778 cases, with 1,799 deaths were reported by the police." Pubna.-A great part of the district is under water in the months of July, August, and September to the extent of several feet. * * * Wells are not used for irrigation, but many kutcha ones exist in the town and district, with good water at a depth of 12 to 15 feet in the dry weather and 6 to 8 or less in the rains. * * * Tanks are not so numerous as in some other districts. Rajshahye.-Cholera prevails annually, usually from March to May, during which period also a good deal of diarrha is met with. The whole district is very dirty, jungly, malarious, and subject to inundations. Maldah.-Cholera, malarious fevers, and dysentery prevail after the rains when the waters begin to dry up. Generally the poorer classes of the people, and those who neglect the laws of health, suffer mostly from diseases; such as those who live in low, damp houses, eat the most unwhole- some food, drink unclean water, and by their avocations are exposed to sudden changes of temperature. The sub-soil water is found at an average depth of 20 feet. In inundations of the Ganges the whole district of Maldah remains under water. During the inundation of the last year the country was for four months, from July to October, under water. Nearly half the land in the district lies waste and covered with jungle or water. The climate of Maldah is not like that of other places in Lower Bengal; situated on the extreme limit of the north tropic, the heat of summer and the cold of winter are both comparatively great, for furthest from the Bay of Bengal,
?(30) it does not possess the advantage of a cooling sea breeze to counteract the effect of the excessive heat of the summer; on the other hand, the piercing cold wind from the north-westerly direction, without any counteracting hot breeze from the direction of the equator, makes its winter much more severe than in the districts of Lower Bengal. The average depth of the water in wells is about 24 feet during the hot seasons and 15 feet during autumn and winter. During the rains the water level is 5 or 6 feet below the surface, and often within hand's reach. The wells, as regards construction, are temporary (kutcha), con- sequently in two or three years they generally fill up by earth falling in from around during the rains, and becoming dry, require to be dug up again in the hot weather. Tanks are not numerous, but the few that are seen are very large, and said to be dug by Hindu Governors of Gour (the ancient name of the district). They are mostly found in or about the ruins of that ancient city. Regarding the general mode of life, it is stated by the Civil Surgeon:- "The habit among up-country people of taking one heavy meal a day and starving for the remaining hours is, I think, pernicious to their health. The custom among the Hindus generally of fasting on festival days and eating raw grain soaked in water, and green fruits afterwards, is also a fruitful source of bowel-complaints, especially diarrha and dysentery, and under epidemic influences it becomes a predisposing cause of cholera. Pilgrims at melas, and travellers on the way, generally eat parched rice soaked in water or curded milk and treacle, with which a large quantity of particles of dust floating in the air are usually mixed." Regarding the epidemic cholera of 1868, it is stated:-"The epidemic cholera which broke out in Maldah in October 1867, * * * did not entirely cease until June last. * * * The inundation of the Ganges during the rains of 1867 laid the whole district of Maldah under water from July to September 1867. The water commenced to dry up in October, when both cholera and fever broke out simultaneously in different parts of the district. * * * More males than females,-more of the labouring classes working in the field, eating worse kinds of food than persons in affluent circumstances and work- ing within doors, eating good and easily digestible foods, more of lower than of higher castes or professions, and more adults than children suffer from cholera. The extent of sickness was great, as very few villages escaped from its ravages. Mortality was also very great, though no satistical record is avail- able on this head. * * * When cholera visits a station where it did not appear at least for some years before it does not leave the place without visiting it successively, at least for three years and then again disappears for some years. The disease is very rare during the rains when the country is under water; and it is remarkable that it invariably breaks out when the waters begin to subside."* * * Rangpur.-The sub-soil   moisture is found at   a  depth   on   an   aver- age of  10 feet.    * * *    Tanks  are very  numerous.    * * * Wells as  a rule are surrounded by bamboo fences.    ***  The inhabitants  of   Rangpur drink water  and  use  the  same for  culinary purposes from any and every source, from  rivers,    tanks,  wells, jhils, swamps,  and  marshes,  and even from any little   hole    containing    a   few   bucketsful    of   collected   rain-water,    the drainage of the country.     * * * The  climate  of  Rangpur is  clooler than most places  in  Lower Bengal.     From  November to  June it is extremely healthy,  from which time fever (the common disease of the  districts) begins being  most rife about the end of the rains and of October.    * * * The district of Rangpur, the Civil Surgeon considers "exceedingly malarious."  Regarding the disposal of the dead, he writes:-"The poorer class of Hindus seldom  burn their dead, but throw the bodies  into the nearest  ditch  or pool of water, often by the side of public highways or in the immediate outskirts of villages, while the Mahomedan population  scratch shallow  graves  two or three feet deep and bury their dead frequently  at their very door-steps in the midst of villages.   There is no regular place set apart for burial  purposes."    There was no epidemic sickness in the  Rangpur district  during the years  1867  and 1868.    The  Civil  Surgeon writes:- * * * "I am given to understand that epidemics are unknown in the district of Rangpur." Julpaigori.-Only came into existence on the 1st January 1869.    It is composed of the whole of the  old Western Duars and the sub-division  of
(31) Bykantpur and Boda, which formerly belonged to the Rangpur district. The district, forms part of the belt of the Terai; all the districts north and nort-west of Jalpaiguri may be called Terai. The country approaching the mountains is very devoid of water during the dry season, and people in some places have to travel ten miles for water. The smaller rivers often pass for many miles under ground and then reappear; the bed which they traverse in the rains remaining to mark their course. Owing to the hard, stony nature of the sub-soil, wells are impracticable. In the plains distant from the hills, the sub-soil is entirely gravel or sand, or a mixture of the two, through which water percolates in all directions. True clay is not found in the district. The district is drained into the Ganges on one side and the Brahmaputra on the other; the slope for natural drainage is well marked and stagnation of water is impossible. Water is found in the dry months at from 12 to 15 feet from the surface. In the rains it is almost level with the surface.*** The country is partially under water during the rains in July, August, and September: the surplus water is, however rapidly carried off when the rains cease, and the lodgment of water is a very rare circumstance.*** Tanks are not numerous. *** The district is undoubtedly malarious, and some portions of it eminently and dangerously so.*** The water supply is from rivers, wells, and tanks. The villages are generally situated on the highest spots of land obtainable. The dead are disposed of by burning on the banks of the rivers and by burial about 4 or 5 feet below the surface at some distance from villages and human habitations, as the case may be. Regarding cholera, the Civil Surgeon of Julpaiguri writes:-"Cholera is raging to the east and west and south, at this moment (14th May), in a very severe form, but it is not a frequent visitor of this district. It seems to have marched north from Rangpur, Kuch Behar, and Purneah." Writing of the general mode of life of the people, he mentions: "Fatigue and frequent wetting during the cultivating seasons, and sleeping on damp floors" as productive of rheumatism; and in regard to the frequency of dyspepsia says- "Food is eaten in too large a quantity at a time, and at too long intervals." He also states:-"Prostitution is very rife, and enthetic diseases, affecting both sexes, and all ages, are exceedingly frequent." Darjiling.-Has only in recent years been reclaimed from dense jungles and populated; it contains the hill sanitarium of the Bengal Province and numerous tea plantations. The population is chiefly agricultural. In 1864 the district was visited by epidemic cholera, but to a limited extent only; it appeared simultaneously all over the district, and the duration of the epidemic was short. Purneah.-The Civil Surgeon reports that no epidemic prevailed in 1868. Burdwan.-Cholera is epidemic in the district. Outbreaks of the disease are of occasional occurrence in Burdwan, but the character of the disease is generally mild. Every year during the hot season sporadic cases are reported. The water-supply is from the Banka river and tanks. Malarious fevers of a severe intermittent and remittent type were epidemic during 1867 and 1868, and caused much loss of life. Bankoora.-The sub-soil water is generally found about 15 to 20 feet below the surface. Tanks are very numerous. There are very few wells indeed. During the rains sub-soil moisture is found at a depth of 17 to 18 feet, and in the cold season of 10 feet. Cholera was very rife in some parts of the district in 1868, especially at Sonamukhi. The Civil Surgeon of Raniganj, in this district, states that" cholera is never absent in spring." Birbhoom.-Regarding cholera, the Civil Surgeon of Suri writes:-" This disease has been flying about the district during the months of March, April, May, July, October, November, and December. Sudden violent outbreaks, of a most virulent character have occurred during the months in question in different localities simultaneously, or at short intervals, carrying off in a few hours a large number of those attacked, and then suddenly disappearing from one place to reappear in another, but in some localities it lingered for longer periods, and even visited the same place in some instances twice during the year." Regarding the meteorology of the year, he writes:-"The only peculiarity calling for notice during the past year was an excessively cloudy,
(32) close, and sultry state of the weather, and a constant slight drizzling rain daily in the month of September; the almost total absence of heavy falls of rain, and the high winds and thunder-storms usual at the setting in and break- ing up of the rains; and the early cessation of the rains in September. The chief characteristic of the climate of Birbhum is its extreme dryness, in which respect it resembles that of the Upper Provinces, but it is neither so hot nor so cold. * * * During the hot season, however, and beginning of the cold, outbreaks of cholera frequently occur, * * * and sporadic cases occasionally occur at other seasons." * * * Rajmahal.-The sub-soil water is found at an average depth of about 14 feet. The whole of the district is higher than the flood level of the Ganges. * * * Cholera and fever are the diseases that prevailed epidem- ically in certain localities during the year 1868. Cholera broke out about the middle of April and continued to prevail in the district to the end of the year, a total of 335 deaths from the disease being reported. Sonthal.-The country is hilly and undulating. The water-supply is from ponds and reservoirs formed by damming the drainage channels on the hill slopes for the retention of rainfall. This district is not so malarious as places in Lower Bengal. Manbhum.-The sub-soil water level is between 17 and 18 feet below the surface. Cholera is almost always hovering about the district, cropping up now and again at different places. Tanks are numerous. Singbhum-Was visited by epidemic cholera in 1861 and 1866; in the latter year the disease appeared in March and continued till October. There was no epidemic cholera in 1868. Hazaribagh.-The general altitude of the district is 1,900 feet. The sub-soil water is tapped at an average depth of 21 feet from the surface. Water for drinking purposes is drawn from wells principally, there are also numerous tanks. A few cases of cholera occurred in the town during part of April and May 1868. There are no statistics to show the prevalence of the disease in the district. The elevation of the station of Hazaribagh is about 2,000 feet. Bhagulpur.-Cholera usually appears about March or April, and in August. It has appeared in every month. This year, 1868, it only came in November and December, and in the town it was only slight. The sub-soil water is reached at from 30 to 40 feet below the surface. The water- supply is from the Ganges river, wells, and tanks. Cholera may be looked on fairly as an endemic disease in this town and district, as it comes every year, and at all seasons of the year (in varying proportions). In 1866 it appeared first in March, in 1867 in April, and in 1868 in November. There are no statistics to show the prevalence of the disease or the mortality caused by it. The police reported a total mortality from cholera in 1868 at only 336, which the Civil Surgeon says is an absurdly low estimate. Monghyr -The sub-soil water is found at a depth of about 20 feet below the surface. The year 1868 was an unusually healthy one in this district. Cholera prevails to some extent every year in this town and district. It generally makes its appearance about the end of March, is common during April, and disappears in May. In years of epidemic prevalence it continues later. Gya.-The sub-soil water is usually found at about 20 feet below the surface, but the depth varies according to locality and season. There are no canals in the district. Cholera is undoubtedly endemic in the town and neighbourhood of Gya. In 1866 the disease prevailed epidemically. Patna.-Here, as elsewhere, we have cholera in the hot months and during muggy breaks in the rains. * * * Cholera and intermittent fever are always endemic here, but neither have assumed any alarming proportions during the last four years. Tirhoot.- The water-supply is from streams, tanks, and wells. Mala- rious fevers are said to be endemic, but no mention is made of cholera. Champaran.-The sub-soil water level during the dry season may average from 15 to 20 feet from the surface, and from 10 to 15 feet during the rainy season. Wells are numerous, and usually lined with tiles; tanks are not
?(    33   ) numerous.   Cholera is one of the prevailing diseases of the district, as also intermittent fever. Midnapur.-The sub-soil water level is from 40 to 60 feet below the surface. Cholera prevailed epidemically in the district throughout the year. The following tabular statement shows the prevalence of the disease monthly, as reported by the police:- Statement showing the Number of Attacks and Deaths from Cholera during the year 1868 in the Midnapur district.

The dates of the appearance of the disease are given as follows for each year of epidemic prevalence:-In 1860 March and June, 1861 March, 1863 Septem- ber and October, 1864 February and March, 1866 February and June, 1868 March and April. Balasore.-The water-supply is from rivers, tanks, and wells. The worst cholera epidemic that has occured in Balasore for some years was in the early part of 1866. The disease is epidemic in the district. Cattack.-The depth of water from the surface varies from 8 to 18 feet, according to season of the year, but in many of the villages skirting the hills, when the wells are sunk in a substratum of laterite, the water may be found within from 2 to 1 feet of the surface, according to the time of the year. Tanks are not numerous, except along the base of the hills, where there may generally be about four to the square mile. Cholera prevails usually from May to August. Puri.-Wells are seldom dry and are numerous; water is generally to be had at from 10 to 20 feet. Drinking water is derived from tanks and wells. Cholera is a constant visitor, and frequently breaks out among the pilgrim assemblages at the several religious fairs held in this district. The incidence of the cholera of 1868 among the troops and jails in the Bengal Province is shown as follows:- Among the European troops-total average strength 3,624-there were altogether 17 admissions and 12 deaths from cholera, giving a death-rate of 3.31 per mille of strength. Of the 8 stations occupied by European troops, the 4 following recorded cholera in 1868:-(exclusive of Chinsura Dept strength ? where there were 21 admissions and 17 deaths):- Fort William... Strength       858 Admissions  5 Deaths   5 Barrackpore  441    2  1 Berhampore  261  8  5 Dinapore  854  2  1 The strength of the affected troops is 2,414, the percentage of admissions to strength 0.70, and of deaths to admission 70. Of the 17 admissions, there were 3 in March, 1 in April, 2 in May, 3 in June, 5 in July, 1 in August, 1 in November, and 1 in December. Among the native troops, total average strength 5,475, there were altogether 36 admissions and 19 deaths from cholera, giving a death-rate of 3.47 per mille of strength. Of the 11 stations occupied by the native troops, the six following recorded cholera in 1868:- Fort William Strength            620  Admissions 2 Deaths 2 Alipore...  672                    15  6 Dum-Dum...   619                  7    3 Barrackpore...  1044                       5  4 Dacca...      355                     6                  3 Dinapore...      660                      1             1 F
(34) The strength of the affected troops is 3,970, the percentage of admissions to strength 0.91, and of deaths to admissions 53. Of the 36 admissions there were 4 in January, 2 in February, 4 in March, 11 in April, 3 in May, 1 in June, 3 in July, 1 in August, 2 in September, 2 in October, and 3 in December. Among the jail populations, total average strength 16,278, there were altogether 289 admissions and 119 deaths from cholera, giving a death-rate of 7.30 per mille of strength.

Of the 289 admissions there were 2 in January, 11 in February, 29 in March, 60 in April, 60 in May, 16 in June, 13 in July, 13 in August, 5 in September, 9 in October, 39 in November and 32 in December.                                Taking all the figures together, the monthly prevalence of the disease is shown in the accompanying diagram. On the map are marked the districts which are known to have been affected with cholera in 1868. Judging from its incidence among the troops and jail populations, the cholera of 1868 in Bengal Province was no more than the ordinary manifestation of the disease in non-epidemic years; and in point of prevalence it appears from the army and jail returns, to have fallen to a minimum of the triennial period, 1866 to 1868, inclusive. This triennial periodicity in the activity and subsidence alternately of the cholera of this Bengal Province is very clearly marked in the army and jail returns, as is shown in the subjoined abstract statement of admissions from cholera among the troops and jail populations in the Bengal Province for the series of five triennial periods, as taken from Bryden's Tables.

The presidency hospitals and troops marching-the strengths of which are not known-are not included in the above statement. The death-rate for 1857 is calculated on the jail returns alone. The above statement shows that during the four successive triennial periods, from 1857 to 1868 inclusive, the cholera of Bengal in its general incidence among the troops and jail populations of the province, has observed a very remarkable regularity of rise and fall within each triennial period.  In the first year of each triennial period the disease has prevailed with epidemic violence, during the second it has somewhat abated, and during the third it has sub- sided to the minimum prevalance of the three-years period, or to the ordinary cholera prevalence of the province. Thus the epidemic years of the series are 1857, 1860, 1863, and 1866; the ordinary years of the series are 1859, 1862, 1865, and 1868; the intermediate or abating years of cholera of the series are 1858, 1861, 1864, and 1867. The figures for the first triennial period of the series, 1854 to 1856 inclusive, do not show the same regularity; this is probably to a certain extent due to the absence of the returns for the European troops during the first two years of the triennial period; but it is to be observed on the other hand that the jail returns taken alone for this three-year period yielded similar anomalous results. Thus the ratio per mille of strength of the jail populations in the whole province is 25.2, 47.5, and 47.3 for the years 1854, 1855, and 1856 respectively; combined with the returns of the native troops for the first two years of the triennial period they yield the rates of 18.3 and 34.6 for 1854 and 1855 respectively, and in the third year of the period, combined with the returns for the European troops also they yieled the rate of 31.2. Probably the returns for the European troops during 1854 and 1855, were they available, would in a measure restore the regularity of cholera prevalence in this three-year period and assmilate the results to the ratios yielded by the succeeding triennial periods of the whole series. As the figures stand, however, we find that in four out of the five succes- sive triennal periods comprised between the years 1854 and 1868 inclusive, there is a remarkable regularity in the rise and fall of cholera activity, and the regularity is so uniform as to preclude the idea of accidental coincidence. It would be interesting and important also to ascertain to what extent, if to any, this regularity in the periodical or cyclical rise and fall of cholera activity in the Bengal Province is connected with the annual rainfall. But most unfortunately no data are available to show the characteristics of these triennial periods in this respect. That there is a real connection between the annual rainfall and the prevalence of cholera in Bengal, as in the other provinces of India, there is no reason to doubt. On the contrary, general obser- vation and popular opinion both strongly incline to the reality of a fixed and determinate relation between the rainfall and cholera activity; but owing to the absence of records, it is at present impossible to show what this relation is F 2
(36) or to fix and determine the causes which affect or influence the inter-depend- ence of cholera and rainfall. In Bengal, contrary to the experince of the other provinces of Northern India, it has been commonly observed that rainfall checks the activity of cholera. This is a point of very great importance, and requires very careful consideration in order to understand why the season of rainfall in Bengal should check cholera activity whilst it favours it in the North-Western Provinces, the Central Provinces, and Panjab, and even in certain portions of the Bengal Province itself. It is a subject we shall have to dwell upon in another part of this work, and we may therefore pass on to the historical, portion of our record without further comment in this place upon the very different effects of rainfall upon cholera prevalence, or the causes which produce that difference, beyond pointing to the very different physical conditions of the several regions alluded to, and the results of rainfall as affecting their several soils, and the people dwelling upon them.

(38) BENGAL PROVINCE, 1869. There are no statistics available regarding the monthly prevalence of cholera among the civil population for the year 1869. The following particulars are gathered from the Report of the Sanitary Commissioner for Bengal for 1869-70 Regarding the prevalence of cholera in the districts of Howrah and Hooghly no information is given. Jessore.-Cholera prevailed in December 1868 and raged till the middle of January 1869; in the Jessore bazar and neighbourhood 139 cases with 84 deaths were reported; all these cases occurred in the native quarters, none amongst the European community. Outbreaks usually occur after a long absence of rain. The disease prevails sporadically throughout the district during the greater part of every year. In April 1869 cholera was raging in various parts of the district, and extra medical aid was asked for. Nuddea.-In October 1868 a few cases of cholera occurred at Santi- pur during a fair that was being held. It then disappeared entirely until the end of November, when it broke out again, and simultaneously it appears to have become generally prevalent all over the district. The disease con- tinued to prevail pretty generally until April 1869, when it disappeared altogether. From eight circles a total of 878 cases with 305 deaths is given. Murshidabad.-Cholera endemic in the district. In 1869 the disease appeared at Jangipur on 11th March, and in the course of April spread rapidly in the district. At the same time cholera was raging in the neigh- bouring districts of Rajshahye and Pubna. Faridpur.-No epidemic during the year. Burisal.-No information supplied regarding cholera in the district during 1869, but 18 deaths from the disease occurred in the jail during the year. Dacca.-Cholera prevalent in the town in February, by the month of June the disease had very nearly subsided, though cases were seen now and then in every month. On the 29th October the disease again broke out, and continued very prevalent in the city during November. After November it abated, but still persisted at the end of the year, though in a much diminished degree. During the latter part of the year cholera prevailed in several parts of the district, but no reliable information of its mortality is available. At the Baroni fair, held at Munshigunge in 1869, 13 miles from Dacca, 8 cases of cholera with 5 deaths occurred; the first case was on 22nd November, the last on 16th December. Cholera was prevailing at Dacca before the fair commenced. Mymensingh.-No report received. Tipperah.-Commencing in the early part of December 1868, cholera pre- vailed to a great extent in the early part of 1869; the disease lasted until May, and out of 3,830 attacked 2,562 proved fatal. The first cases commenced in the northern part of the district, the disease spread rapidly over the district, following no regular course, appearing suddenly in one place, and disappearing as suddenly after carrying off a few victims, then reappearing in another; it was noticed that places in the neighbourhood of rivers and khals suffered more than others. Cholera is endemic in this district, cases being reported every month throughout the year, but it prevails mostly in the cold and dry months, as is shown in the following statement compiled from police reports during the year:- Months. Cases. Deaths. Months.   Cases. Deaths. January ... 1,474 978 September    ... 1 1 February 435 387 October ... . . . ...

?(39) Noakhali.-The Civil Surgeon reports that there was no epidemic cholera. Chittagong.-Cholera prevailed in Cox's Bazar from 6th April to 24th May; the disease was also prevalent at Teknaf, Chakaria, and Kutubdi islands, but no details of the mortality are given for these places. In the Kushtia sub-division 441 deaths from cholera during 1869 were reported by the police. Pubna.-Cholera appeared in January, suddenly increased about the middle of February, and attained alarming mortality for about a week after the 8th March, when a slight fall of rain occuring, the number of deaths decreased for a few days, but again on the 18th March they became very numerous, and continued so until the 26th March, when they began to decrease. During the 48 days, from 7th February to 5th April, 181 persons died of cholera in the district; from the 6th to 16th April 21 deaths occurred within the Pubna Municipality. Cholera did not break out, as is usual, in the months of September and October. Rajshahye.-Cholera was prevalent in the district. In the Nathor sub- division, from the 1st January to the end of May 71 deaths were reported, of which 17 occurred in May and 18 during the last 10 days of April. Maldah.-Cholera prevailed in April and again in December. Rungpore.-No mention is made of cholera in the reports from Rungpore, but the Sanitary Commissioner writes:-" If I am not mistaken, however, cholera was prevailing in the district of Rungpore during the spring months." Dinagepur.-Cholera in a sporadic form was hanging about the district in the beginning of April. At the Nekmard fair, which was held during the second week of April, only 4 cases of cholera occurred, and of these 2 recovered. After the fair some isolated cases occurred on the roads, but on the 15th April the district was reported free from cholera. Julpiguri.-Cholera of a very virulent type prevailed extensively, many families being completely swept away; villages became depopulated. The epidemic ceased on the occurrence of frequent thunder-storms accompanied by heavy falls of rain. The disease occurred in the south and west of the district in April and May, but the station of Julpiguri appears to have remained nearly free from the disease. Cholera prevailed extensively in Rungpore and Cooch Behar in March 1869, and probably spread from thence into the Julpiguri district. Darjeeling.-On the 7th May 1869 cholera appeared near Mattigara police- station in the Terai portion of the district, about 40 miles from Darjeeling and close to the high roads from the plains. On the 21st May two boys, sons of a coolie, were attacked on the Makkibaria estate, 22 miles from Darjeeling; elevation 3,500 feet. They lived in a hut on the high roadside from the plains. No cholera was reported at that date in the country intervening between this place and Mattigara. The first case at Mattigara was reported to be that of a man who had retured with the disease upon him from a place in the Julpiguri district, 12 miles from Mattigara. There was no history of human importation in the Makkibaria cases. The third point of outbreak was at Pankabari, five miles below Makkibaria; elevation 1,800 feet. The greater part of the traffic from the plains passes through Pankabari. One of the first attacked was a cart driver from Purneah; this was on the 3rd June. The fourth point of outbreak was on the Takvar tea estate, some six miles north- west of Darjeeling; elevation 5,000 feet; the first case occurred in the last week of July; here again no human importation could be traced. There was at the time no cholera nearer Takvar than in the Terai over 30 miles off. The fifth point of outbreak was in the station of Darjeeling on the 14th August. There had been no case for the previous ten days at Takvar, where the disease had died out, and there was no cholera nearer than the Terai, 26 miles distant. In the station of Darjeeling the first person attacked was a tailor, an elderly man, who had been delicate for some time before. He lived with his family in a hut in a quite sequestered part of the station, some hundred yards below the convent, where he worked. No other houses were near his. He rarely went to the bazar, and had had no communication with Takvar tea estate or the Terai. No main road passed near his house. The family included seven or eight individuals of different ages. He died in a few hours. Two more sickened of cholera on the 17th, of whom one died rapidly and the
(40) other was removed by the survivors, who suddenly abandoned the house and fled no one could say where. They returned on the 23rd. The child taken away sick had died, another was brought back ill, and two more were seized after their return. * * * The site of their house is on a steep slope unfavour- able by the necessary absence of sub-soil moisture to the development of cholera from germs on the Pettenkofer theory. * * * The second case attacked in the station was also * * * a tailor, but like the first, one who worked exclusively at a European house. He lived in one of a collec- tion of some dozen huts close by the high road about a mile from the Darjeeling bazar. These huts were all crowded by Nepaulese. * * * He was attacked on the 15th August and died on the 17th. Not another case occurred in this busti, but a report reached the man's employers a little later, that the tailor's wife and children, who had gone after his death some miles into the interior, died of cholera. The tailor had worked for weeks at his employer's house, and, as in the first case, I-writes the Civil Surgeon-could never discover how cholera reached him. On the 17th three cases of cholera occurred in the bazar. On the 18th two cases of cholera besides these were brought into the special hospital then organized. A day or two later a Dhangar died in a few hours of the disease in the bazar; then the disease disappeared. The seizures occurred over about eight days. More than half of those attacked died. I observed no particular change in the weather when cholera ceased. I saw the majority of the cases in the station, but noted no difference in respect of symptoms and course from cholera elsewhere. * * * If the police reports are to be believed it (cholera) hung about the station for several months in the height of the rains in 1864. * * * I have no information either as to its ravages in the Terai. It appears to have broken out and died away again several times between May and September without moving in any epidemic wave. (From the report of Dr. T. Mathew). The disease did not enter the Darjeeling Jail, nor did it attack any Europeans at the Sanitarium. At Mattigara, from 7th May to 14th August, 103 cases occurred with 89 deaths; at Nakisar Bari, from 26th May to 14th August, 39 cases with 31 deaths; at Kursiong, from 20th May to the first week of August, 104 cases with 69 deaths; at Phansidiwa, from 2nd July to 9th August, 28 cases with 23 deaths. In the Cooch Behar Division cholera was raging in the villages of the Singimari district on the east bank of the Brahmaputra river during January and February 1869, and at Sirajganj also about the same time. In Singimari district 93 deaths were reported up to beginning of February. The disease appeared first among the Mahomedans residing on the sand banks adjacent to the Brahmaputra at the time of the Ramazan fast, and it was observed that villages where there were large trees suffered less than those were there were none. Purneah.-It is stated that cholera generally appears in Purneah in every alternate year, between March and May. It has not been so severe as this year since 1863. The first case in 1869 occurred in the eastern part of the district on the 5th February, about the breaking up of the Caragola fair, which is generally about the time that the disease is looked for. The disease was general over the district; the following deaths were registered:- Months Feb. March April. May. June. Total. Deaths 10 84 1,512 239 7 1,852 The number of recorded attacks was 3,038, but the Civil Surgeon believes that at least 10,000 must have been attacked. In the town of Purneah the first case occurred on the 12th February; 114 deaths were recorded from 12th February to 8th June. In the jail only a single case occurred, on the 17th April, although 400 persons are reported to have died in the neighbour- hood. Among the police-757 strong-there were three cases, all fatal, and all in February. Burdwan.-In the report from this district nothing is said of cholera. Bankurah.-There are no statistics given regarding the prevalence of cholera among the rural population of this district. At Sonamukhi the disease appeared at the beginning of the year, after the epidemic of fever, and lasted until February; 63 deaths occurred in seven days, but no statistics of
?(41) the outbreak are available. In the town of Bankurah cholera appeared in March. In December the disease was prevalent in Bishanpur, where 17 died in three weeks. Beerbhum.-Cholera prevailed in every month from January to August inclusive; 1,173 attacks with 838 death were reported. Rajmehal.-No information available. Sonthal.-On the 7th February, two days before the great day of the Shibrt festival at the temple of Byjnath in Deogarh, a woman, a resident of the town, was attacked with cholera and died after 13 hours in hospital. On the 11th a pilgrim who had been suffering from diarrha for four days on the road was brought to hospital in a state of unconsciousness; he died after a few hours. From this time the disease continued to pre- vail in the town till the 21st or 22nd, when it abated. About the middle of March fresh cases again occurred, and in a few days the disease prevailed virulently in the filthiest parts of the town. At the end of April the disease spread to the villages around and became general, and also attacked the coolies working on the railway. About the middle of May it gradually subsided, but in September re-appeared again in different parts of the district. The disease prevailed most severely when the weather was cloudy and drizzly. In Deogarh there were 251 cases treated, with 74 deaths. The number of deaths in the district is unknown. Manbhum.-Cholera was prevalent generally throughout the district during every month, from January to October 1869. At Purulia the first case occurred on the 3rd February, the last on the 22nd June. There was a sharp outbreak in a village about a mile distant between the 13th and 22nd February, there being 27 attacks with 19 deaths. At Purulia 27 deaths occurred in the town, and one among the police-148 strong-on 23rd June. The following deaths in the district from 21 registering stations were reported by the police:- Months. Deaths. Months. Deaths. January  4 August 8 February 18 September 24 March 51 October 10 April 31 Total 321 May 73   June 38   July 64   Singbhum.-There was no epidemic in 1869. Hazaribagh.-The police reported a total of 1,075 deaths from cholera throughout the district in 1869. The large and filthy city of Echak, where cholera usually prevails with great fatality, this year escaped altogether. The large town of Chattra, however, about 38 miles west of Hazaribagh, which was free from the disease last year, has this year suffered rather severely. The first case of cholera in 1869 was reported on the 1st March at the village of Bugdah, 50 miles south-east of Hazaribagh, on the borders of Man- bhum district. Cases were reported from the district till the 19th March, when a constable, who had been on guard at the central jail, was attacked. He was taken to the hospital and died soon after admission. On the 22nd a resident of the town of Hazaribagh, who had returned 12 days previously from Gya, was seized with the disease. On the 3rd April cholera broke out at Bar, 52 miles east of Hazaribagh, and was said to have been introduced by a marriage procession from Khetu, a village in the same sub-division; but it was not determined that the disease was prevailing at Khetu. The man in whose house the marriage was celebrated was the first to die, and after him one of his relatives. The majority of those who died during the three days that the disease prevailed were of the weaver caste. From 20th April to 13th July there was a lull in the prevalence of the disease. It was then reported to be raging in different parts of the Pugarh sub-division. A few cases were reported in August; and on the 14th October two constables died at Hazari- bagh, after which no other case appeared. It has been ascertained that the whole of the police guard drank water from a polluted source, the use of which had long been forbidden, but only two men were attacked. They had fasted G
(42) or two days and afterwards eaten freely, chiefly large quantities of sweet- meats. It is particularly to be observed that nearly the whole of the northern part of the district escaped the disease, which did not seem to follow the main line of traffic. Chota Nagpur.-In the whole tract of country from Palamow to the Hazaribagh borders and from Ranchi to the Palamow borders and in Lohar- dugga, cholera was very prevalent from April to August, and many deaths were reported. In Palamow 2,000 cases are supposed to have occurred between the 19th April, when the epidemic commenced, and the 15th July; of 378 cases treated 111 proved fatal. At Ranchi, where cholera had shown itself in the bazar every now and then since March, the disease re-appeared on the 3rd August. Bhagalpur.-Cholera appeared first in this district on the 3rd February in the persons of two police constables who had arrived from Purneah and Sahibganj. During the month of February the disease appeared at Katauria on the 13th, at Kumarganj on the 22nd, and at Kolgaon on the 26th, all in widely different directions, but to the south of the river; after this the disease appeared simultaneously in numerous places no th of the river, and this part of the district was much more affected than the southern portion; by the middle of April the disease had reached its greatest intensity, and many places suffered very severely, all the circles on the main line of traffic north of the river were affected. The disease continued to rage till the end of May, when it gradually subsided, until its final disappearance in October. No part of the district escaped altogether, but the northern was affected much more severely than the southern portion, and the station of Bhagalpur itself was comparatively exempt; here the land is comparatively high. The first case within the Bhagalpur Municipality, the area of which is about 8 square miles, with a population of over 60,000, occurred on the 3rd March 1869; there were reported 79 deaths out of 246 cases. In the local dispensary 148 cases with 21 deaths were treated from January to September inclusive. Among the police- 274 strong-there were 3 cases with 1 death. The following deaths were reported in the district during 1869:- Months. Deaths. Months. Deaths. February 4 August 21 March 101 September 5 April 826 October ...  6 May 304 Total 1,358 June  42   July  49   Monghyr.-Cholera in this year spread over the entire district, but in a very mild form. The disease first appeared on the 23rd March in the village of Bilah adjoining the Bhagalpur district, in the north east and at the same time in the extreme west in the direction of Tirhoot. In the south it appeared on the 9th April at Fathipur, an isolated village in the hills. The first case in the town of Monghyr itself occurred on the 9th January 1869, the patient was a European railway passenger brought from Jamalpur, he recovered. The first death in the town of Monghyr was reported on the 15th February, soon after some camp followers of the Madras Native Infantry Regiment, sent from Jamalpur, had died in the Monghyr hospital There was no epidemic of cholera in the civil station. Among the municipal police-343 strong-one death from cholera occurred on the 22nd April. On the occurrence of a thunder-storm, which occurred on the 22nd April, three patients in a state of collapse im- mediately revived in an unexpected manner. During the prevalence of the epidemic an east wind prevailed for months at a time, when it used to have a westerly wind.

(43) Gya.-No part of this district escaped cholera in 1869, but the western portion suffered most severely. The first case occurred on the 8th January in a village on the opposite side of the river Falgun close by the town of Gya. In the town of Gya, population 70,000, there were 213 deaths from cholera during the year. It prevailed more severely in the town of Sahibganj than in the old town of Gya, although the first is wonderfully clean whilst the old town is notoriously filthy. No Europeans or Eurasians in the civil station were attacked. The strength of the police in the station was 375, in the district 1,031; only two deaths occurred from cholera, and these were both away from the lines. The following is the return of deaths reported during the year, but the Civil Surgeon believes these figures much exaggerate the prevalence of the disease:- Months. Deaths. Months.  Deaths.

The first case appeared in Patna itself on 25th January 1869. The first case in the civil station of Bankipur occurred on 12th October, 4 deaths occurred from cholera, all Europeans in the convent. Among the police at Bankipur-1,700 strong-there were 26 attacks with 6 deaths. The Mitapur Jail was affected, there were 16 attacks with 5 deaths; the first case occurred on the 27th March and the last on the 17th April. The Inspector-General of Jails writes:-There can be no doubt that the cholera in this instance began in the jail and was not imported from without. The following are the deaths from cholera reported during the year in this district:- Months. Deaths. Months. Deaths.

It prevailed most severely at Sasseram, where the disease broke out on the 16th April, 8 persons having died on the previous night, 30 deaths occurred on the 17th. The Commissioner of Patna reports that during these two days the wind was easterly. On the 18th it was from the westward; cholera at once disappeared. On the 20th the wind was again easterly; cholera re-appeared, and five persons died. In the native city of Arrah-population about 20,000-the first case occurred on the 19th April, the last on the 13th September, during that time 263 deaths occurred from cholera. No cases occurred in the civil station. Of 847 police, not one was attacked. The following is the return of deaths from cholera in this district during the year. Months. Deaths. Months. Deaths.

?(44) Saran.-No portion of this district altogether escaped cholera in 1869 The first case reported occurred in January in the village of Karpubya in the centre of the district. No case was reported in February. In March four cases occurred in villages not far distant from Karpubya. In April the disease broke out in the north-western portion of the district, 40 miles distant from Kurpubya; during May it was general throughout the district. The first case in the town of Saran occurred in May; no cases occurred in the civil station. Cholera appeared in the town of Chaprah on the 17th July 1879, and on the following day in the district jail. The following is the return of cholera deaths in the district during the year, but the figures are believed to under-rate the mortality:- Months. Deaths. Months. Deaths.

The disease was most prevalent in the north-east and eastern portions of the district. The first case was reported on the 9th April in a village about 50 miles due east of Muzaffarpur and about 20 from the eastern border of the district. On the 3rd May the disease had spread as far west as Durbhanga, where it continued to rage for a month and a half; upwards of 1,000 deaths were reported by the police. The first case at Muzaffarpur occurred on the 9th May, but here the epidemic did not become very severe. The epidemic lasted until the end of September, and according to police reports, carried off 10,442 persons. The Civil Surgeon believes that this number might be nearly doubled. When the disease first began to spread in the district a very dry west wind was blowing strongly for several weeks, the difference between the dry and wet bulb thermometer averaged from 18 to 20, and the sub soil moisture was very deficient. Champaran.-Cholera is endemic here. The first case in 1869 occurred on the 15th April in a village in the Sogaon circle, the disease advanced from the western to the eastern part of the district gradually and steadily, though not quickly. At Mitihuri, the first case occurred in the person of a female beggar on the 24th June; the last on the 30th October: total deaths 22. No Europeans or Eurasians were attacked. Cholera raged in this district from April till November during the driest and also during the wettest weather, but with varying severity. The number of cholera deaths reported is 4,230 and of attacks 5,816. Midnapur.-No report furnished. Balasore.-No report furnished, but cholera is stated to have been present in the town and district in April. Thirty deaths were reported in the town from cholera during the month ending 20th April. Cuttack.-Cholera was less prevalent than usual in this district in 1869. comparatively few cases occurred in the city, and only a few villages situated near the roads along which pilgrims passed to and from Juggarnath suffered from the disease. From Chowdar, a village on the pilgrim route, about 6 miles from Cuttack, 29 deaths from cholera were reported. It is a very filthy place, abounding with sickening smells, and with streets so narrow that in passing along an umbrella cannot be held over the head. Puri.-Cholera appeared in the early part of the year, and continued till August after the rains had finally set in. In villages near Puri, where insanitary conditions abound, the reported mortality was great. The villages farthest removed from the sea and on the pilgrim routes suffered the most. The divisions of the district along the coast returned only 23 out of 1,089 total deaths from this disease. The incidence of the cholera of 1869 among the troops and jails in the Bengal Province is shown in the following abstract statement. Among the European troops-total average strength 3,718-there were 7 admissions and 2 deaths, giving a death-rate of 0.54 per mille of strength.
?(45) Of the 8 stations occupied by European troops, the three following recorded cholera in 1869:- Dum-Dum Strength  500 Admissions  2 Deaths 0 Berhampore  154  1  1 Dinapore          867  4  1 The strength of the affected troops is 1,521, the percentage of admissions to strength 0.46, and of deaths to admissions 28.  Of the 7 admissions there were 1 in April, 1 in May, 1 in June, 1 in July, 1 in August, 1 in September and 1 in December. Among the native troops-total average strength 5,080-there were altogether 41 admissions and 20 deaths from cholera, giving a death-rate of 394 per mille of strength. Of the 10 stations occupied by native troops, the 7 following recorded cholera in 1869 :- Fort William Strength  620 Admissions    4 Deaths   3 Alipore  797  5  2 Dum-Dum  420  1  1 Barrackpore  826  2  1 Dacca  331  13  7 Jalpaigori  633  1  1 Dinapore  532  15  5 The strength of the affected troops is 4,159, the percentage of admissions to strength 0.98, and of deaths to admissions 49. Of the 41 admissions there were 12 in February, 6 in March, 6 in April, 7 in May, 4 in June, 4 in August, 1 in November, and 1 in December. Among the jail populations--total average strength 17,194--there were altogether 488 admissions and 182 deaths from cholera, giving a death-rate of 10.58 per mille of strength.

Of the 488 admissions there were 9 in January, 13 in February, 53 in March, 73 in April, 67 in May, 38
(46) in   June, 114 in  July, 30 in August,  25 in September, 7 in October, 41 in November, and 18 in December. Taking all the figures together, the monthly prevalence of the disease is shown on the accompanying diagram. On the map are marked the districts in which cholera is recorded to have prevailed in 1869. It is worthy of note that of all the jails that of Noakhali recorded cholera in only 1864 during the series of five years from 1862 to 1869 inclusive. Some other jails also showed a remarkable exemption from the disease, although it prevailed in the district around. Meteorology.-The most striking feature of the atmosphere of 1869 as compared with that of 1868 is its high range in the first five months of the year. * * * The greatest excess of temperature then occurred at Berhampore, and at this station was at its maximum in May, or immediately preceding the commencement of the rains. But Patna, Hazaribagh, Benares, and Rurki also show excessive temperature in May, second only in this respect to Berhampore. Humidity.-Except at Saugor Island, Calcutta, and False Point, the atmosphere in the earlier months of 1869 was generally drier than in the corresponding months of 1868. This was especially the case at Berhampore, Jessore, Darjeeling, Patna, and Monghyr (out of 13 stations), as well as appa- rently in the North-Western Provinces, and it seems not improbable that it was at least in part due to the deficient rainfall of the preceding year. Hazaribagh seems in some degree to be an exception to the rule, since, while the temperature was considerably higher in the earlier months of 1869 than in those of 1868, the humidity of March and April was also higher. But even here the chief excess of temperature was in February and May, and in both years the dryness and temperature were comparatively great and the Barometer low. The absolute distribution of humidity during 1869, in like manner, was in general inversely as the temperature. Rainfall.-The rainfall in 1869 was less than the average in Orissa, the Gangetic delta, and Arracan. Also in Eastern Bengal (except Sylhet and probably Cherrapunji) in Lower Assam, Sikkim, and parts of Bihar. It was above the average at Suri and Berhampore, and over a tract of country stretch- ing between the Rajmahal Hills and the Bhutan Duars, including Dinajpur, Rungpur, and probably Julpaiguri and Baxa. The rainfall in Upper Assam seems also to have been in excess of the average, and it certainly was so in Sylhet. It appears from the rainfall returns for 67 stations in the Bengal Province, that the rainfall of 1869 was considerably less than that of 1868 in Orissa and the delta of the Ganges, slightly less in the eastern and north- eastern, considerably greater in the western and north-western circuits. In 1868, with the barometric depression in the north-west of the Bay of Bengal, the rainfall was excessive in the western part of the delta and Northern Orissa, and the vapour-bearing winds were arrested or drawn aside from their usual course towards the highly heated plains of the North-West and the Punjab. In 1869 there was a local barometric depression in the elevated country to the west of the Gangetic delta, and an unusually high temperature during the hot-weather months; at the entrance of the Assam Valley the temperature was below the mean, and the barometer relatively high, and there was probably a second local barometric depression in Upper Assam.

?(   49   ) BENGAL PROVINCE, 1870. For the first time the mortuary registers of this province show the mortality registered from cholera among the civil population in 1870. The returns, how- ever, are confessedly very imperfect and unreliable. Such as they are, however, they are shown in the annexed tabular statement. As the monthly figures are not available for all the districts, the provincial monthly tolals are unattainable. The total number of deaths registered from cholera during 1870 among the civil population of the province is given at 21,691. The ratio per mille of population under registration is 0.70. The following particulars regarding the cholera of 1870 in this province are gathered from the Sanitary Administration Report for Bengal for that year. Howrah.-No epidemic cholera prevailed; nine deaths, all sporadic cases, are reported in December. Throughout the district food was abundant and the price of rice was low. Neither floods nor cyclones nor drought occurred during the year. Serampore.-Cholera was prevalent in the district almost every month dur- ing the first half of the year, but not in epidemic form. March, April, and May were the most fatal months. About the middle of February the disease broke out almost simultaneously at Bidiabatti and Astorah, and soon after at Serampore and Kishtonagar, and then spread towards Chanditollah. In April the disease declined but in December it re-appeared in Kishtonagar. Hugli.-Sporadic cases of cholera were reported from several places during the year, which is described as " far more healthy than usual." At the Tribani fair, in March, only two cases of cholera occurred out of a congregation of 16,000 persons. Nuddea.-Cholera prevailed over a great part of the district for many months. It appeared first on 7th February in the district, and spread rapidly. The total number of villages affected was 486-a very few cases occurred in the large towns of Kishangarh, Santipur, and Ranaghat. The police reported the number of those attacked at 4,657, and of deaths at 2,866. The Civil Surgeon thought 2,000 might safely be added to the number of attacks and 1,000 to the number of deaths reported. Jessore.-The year is described as one "of unusual salubrity" in this district. Only 64 deaths from cholera are reported to have occurred in the last six months of the year. Murshidabad.-Cholera appeared first at Berhampore in March, and prevail- ed in that district during 7 months of the year. Deaths were reported from 21 registering circles in the district. The disease is usually absent in the district from October to February inclusive. Faridpur.-A severe form of epidemic cholera broke out in the district in the beginning of the year 1870; it reached its height in March and April, by which time it had spread pretty uniformly throughout all the registration circles. " It is remarkable that while the district was more or less extensively invaded all over by cholera during four months, not a single case occurred in the jail during its continuance, although daily recruited by fresh admissions from all quarters, as usual, throughout the invasion." Bakirganj.-Epidermic cholera broke out in the villages of the island of Dhakan Shahbazpur in December 1869, and continued till June 1870; the number of deaths is estimated at 2,000. Fever was also raging at the time. The rest of the district was unusually healthy. Only a few cases of cholera occurred in Barisal itself. Dhaka.-There was no epidemic cholera. It is worthy of record that this year the inundations were high and unusually long continued. Kachar.-Cholera appeared in May in the villages in the Hylakandy Valley, where 86 cases with 35 deaths occurred. The village of Tarapur, close to the station and on the Sylhet road, was next affected; there were 39 cases with 23 deaths. The meteorological conditions were also favourable for the develop- ment and propagation of the disease, there being an excessive drought at the commencement of the year: Mymensing.-There were a few isolated cases of sporadic cholera in different parts of the district, but no epidemic prevailed. H
?(    50    ) Tipperah.-Cholera prevailed epidemically with greatest virulence from January to April. Noakhali.-Cholera prevailed epidemically in this district in the early part of the year; 779 deaths were reported during the year from eight circles. Chittagong.-Cholera prevailed epidemically almost throughout the whole year in the central and northern circles, particularly during the first half of the year, but few cases were reported from the circles in the south. In the town itself cholera raged from March till May in a milder form, but over a larger area than in 1869. Pubna.-There were only a few cases of cholera in this district during 1870. Rajshahi.-Cholera appeared in the district on the 26th February and at Beauliah on the 17th March, and continued to spread, but these numbers were considered to be " short of the truth." On the 11th June an outbreak of cholera occurred at Ferozepara, seven miles south-east of Natore, and continued till the 22nd: 40 cases with 22 deaths occurred in a population of about 300. The outbreak was attributed " to the use of water that had percolated through ground in which human bodies had only recently been buried. The disease confined itself to this locality and did not attack any of the neghbouring villages lying even within half a mile." At Beauleah itself cholera prevailed from March to November; 174 deaths were reported in a population of 42,003, but the number was considered to be under-stated. The jail was not affected till October, when eight cases (with one of choleraic diarrha) with eight deaths occurred. Bogra.-There was no epidemic cholera. The year 1870 was an unusually healthy one in this district. Rungpur.-No data are furnished regarding cholera. Maldah.-Cholera prevalent throughout the year, but not so severe as in 1869. Darjiling.-The district was remarkably healthy during 1870; only one or two cases of cholera reported in the Terai. Burdwan.-There was not much cholera in 1870. The disease appeared in Burdwan itself in April and lasted four weeks; total cases 52, with 29 deaths. There was an outbreak at Culnah in August, with about 20 deaths. Bankurah.-Cholera was prevalent throughout the year in this district, it prevailed at Bankura itself from 23rd February to 14th October, during which period it caused 85 deaths. Birbhum.-Cholera prevailed to a limited extent in this district from March to July inclusive; there were 263 cases with 140 deaths. Rajmahal.-Cholera prevailed from March to September; there were about 200 cases at Rajmahal itself. Deogarh.-Cholera appeared in this district in the beginning of February, a little before the great Shibrat festival, and gradually spread to the town on the 13th, where the first resident was attacked on the 15th. The weather at the time was cool and pleasant, the thermometer ranging from 53 to 58, and the wind blowing strong from the west and north-west. The epidemic subsided in about three weeks. In the town of Deogarh there were 120 cases, but only 41 deaths were recorded. Hazaribagh.-Cholera appeared in the district in the first week of Feb- ruary to the north and north-east of Hazaribagh, and gradually spread in all directions. At Hazaribagh itself the first case appeared on the 18th June, and the disease continued in the place till the 21st August, the total number of cases being 112, with 61 deaths. Manbhum.-Cholera prevailed to a slight extent in the western portion of the district during the second quarter of the year; the number of cases or deaths is not given. Singbhum.-At Chaibasa the first case occurred on the 11th June and the last on the 1st July; there were 14 cases with 10 deaths. The only peculiarity observed during the outbreak was that mostly children of from 4 to 10 years of age were attacked. Bhagalpur.-Cholera was epidemic in this district both in 1869 and 1870. In the latter year the disease appeared in the district on the 15th
(    51    ) February and at Bhagalpur and Banka on the 23rd February. In March cholera was wide-spread in the district, affecting the south much more than the north. In April it was at its height, declining in July. Both in 1869 and 1870 cholera in this district was observed to subside on the setting in of the east winds; whilst the disease prevailed the wind was westerly. Gya.-There were a few sporadic cases of cholera from time to time in the district, but more frequently in the months from May to August. Shahabed.-The rains were very heavy, and continued up to a late date, even so late as the end of October, and as a consequence an unusual amount of fever of a severe intermittent and remittent type prevailed during the succeeding two months over nearly the whole of the district, but chiefly in the southern portions of it. The crops during the year were good and the price of food below that of the previous year. A slight outbreak of cholera was reported at Jugdespur, in the south, but it soon ceased as the rains set in heavily and the weather became cooler. Sarun.-There was not much cholera in this district during 1870. In the fair held in this district there were seven cases of cholera and only one death in an assemblage of about 50,000 persons. There was one fatal case in the jail and another among the police-600 strong. Tirhut.-Cholera was prevalent in this district about March and reached its height in July, after which it began to decline. In July the mortality stood at 1,229. Chumparun.-No mention is made of cholera by the Civil Surgeon, who took charge of the station late in year. Midnapur.-Cholera is endemic at Midnapur. The disease in 1870 broke out on the 28th January near Midnapur Bazar, where there were 19 cases with eight deaths out of a population of 500. On the 17th March the disease assumed an epidemic form and became wide-spread, more particularly amongst the poor. The disease was at its height from 20th March to 20th April, declining in May. There were about 500 cases and half as many deaths. Balasur.-There was a virulent form of cholera here during February and March, and the disease was prevalent in the district to the close of the year. Kattak.-Cholera prevailed during June, July, and August, when it is known to occur every year throughout the district, especially along the pilgrim route. In October, November, and December it occurred in villages by the road side, most of the cases being return travellers from Puri. During the last six months the deaths are reported to have been 485. Puri.-Cholera raged in the town from the 12th February to 21st March, and there was a second outbreak on the 14th June, which spread to the whole town and its vicinity. In October and November there were a few sporadic cases. In the town there were 420 deaths, exclusive of 127 in the hospital. The pilgrims visiting the place suffered severely; in the jail there were 6 cases with 3 deaths; and among the police 2 cases, both fatal. The general conclusions deducible from all the local reports regarding cholera during the year under review, writes the Sanitary Commissioner for Bengal, Dr. D. B. Smith, seems to be as follows :- (a)-The spring and the cold season were the periods of greatest pre- valence. As a general rule the disease declines throughout Bengal during the rains. (b)-The districts in which the greatest mortality is reported to have occurred were Bakirganj, Bhagulpur, Tirhut, Chittagong, and Tipperah. (c)-As usual, some Civil Surgeons believe the disease to have been spread by human inter-communication, whilst others strongly oppose this opinion. (d)-On the whole the year (1870) was one of general comparative immunity from the ravages of cholera. The deaths reported among the pilgrims in Orissa were much lower than commonly occurs. The incidence of the  cholera of 1870   among the   troops  and jail popu- lations in this province is shown in the following abstract statement:- Among the European troops-total average strength 3,724-there were altogether 28  admissions  and  11  deaths from cholera, giving a death-rate of H 2
?(52) 2 95 per mille of strength.   Of the 6 stations occupied by European troops, the 4 following recorded cholera in 1870:- Fort William Strength  875 Admissions 2 Deaths  2 Dum-Dum            611      1  0 Hazaribagh              842      21  6 Dinapur                849      4  3 The strength of the affected troops is 3,177, the percentage of admissions to strength is 088, and of deaths to admissions 39. Of the 28 admissions there were 1 in March, 1 in April, 19 in July, 2 in August, .4 in October, and 1 in November. Among the families of the European soldiers there were the following admissions from cholera in 1870 :- Women-total average strength 398-admissions 9 and deaths 4 in the 3 following stations out of 6 occupied by the women, viz :- Fort William Strength  107 Admissions    2 Deaths  0 Hazaribagh     80  4  2 Dinapur         95  3  2 The strength of the affected women is 282, the percentage of admissions to strength is 319, and of deaths to admissions 44. Children-total average strength 680-admissions 7 and deaths 7 in the 2 following stations out of 6 occupied by the children, viz :- Hazaribagh Strength  121 Admissions    5 Deaths  5 Dinapur                 173  2  2 The strength of the affected children is 294, the percentage of admissions to strength is 238, and of deaths to admissions 100. Of the 16 admissions of women and children, there were 1 in March, 1 in April, 2 in May, 3 in June, 8 in July, and 1 in August. Among the native troops-total average strength 5,206-there were alto- gether 25 admissions and 17 deaths from cholera, giving a death-rate of 326 per mille of strength. Of the 11 stations occupied by native troops, the 6 following recorded cholera in 1870:- Port William Strength  638 Admissions    6 Deaths  4 Alipur  960      8  3 Dum-Dum      475  2  1 Barrackpur             675      3  3 Berhampur  122      1  1 Dacca                                   309  5  5 The strength of the affected troops is 3,179, the percentage of admissions to strength is 079, and of deaths to admissions 68. Of the 25 admissions there were 3 in January, 3 in February, 5 in March, 8 in April, 3 in May, and 3 in June. Among the jail populations-total average strength 16,751-there were altogether 432 admissions and 170 deaths from cholera, giving a death-rate of 1015 per mille of strength. Of the 48 jails in the province, 35 recorded cholera in 1870. The strength of the 35 affected jails altogether is 13,893, the percentage of admissions to strength 311, and of deaths to admissions 39. Of the 432 admissions there were 10 in January, 16 in February, 41 in March, 36 in April, 17 in May, 19 in June, 184 in July, 49 in August, 46 in September, 5 in October, 7 in November, and 2 in December. Taking all the figures together, the monthly prevalence of the disease is shown in the accompanying diagram. The districts affected with cholera in 1870 are shown on the map for that year. Compared with the returns for the preceding year, the incidence of the cholera of 1870 among the troops and jail populations in this province is, as was to be expected from the indications of the three-year cycle statistics given in the review of 1868, considerably less than in the preceding year 1869, which was the epidemic year of the next triennial period following that ending with 1868. In the year 1869 the total of admissions from cholera among the troops and jail populations in this province is 546, in 1870 the total is 485, or including the admissions among the families of the European soldiers, for the first time tabulated in this year, the total of cholera admission is 501, still considerably below the figure of the epidemic year 1869. Meteorology.-In the Howrah district the rainfall of 1870 was much below the average, but the total amount measured, 5443 inches, was so equally

?(53) distributed as to time that it proved sufficient for all agricultural purposes. In Serampore the total fall registered was 47.76 inches, and at Hugli 56.20 inches. At Kishnaghar, Nuddia, the fall was 43.78 inches, which is very much below the average. At Jessore it was 76.042 inches. The fall at Berhampur was 56.69 inches, which is less by 10 inches than the fall of the preceding year. At Faridpur the total rainfall was 76.15 inches. In a tabular statement of the greatest mean monthly variations of heat in each month at Faridpur for the five years, from 1866 to 1870, it is shown that, as usual, the rainy months main- tained the most equable temperature during the year, the cold months and the three immediately preceding the rains showed increased variations, and the two most varied months were February and March. As was to be expected, the prevalence of general sickness observed a direct ratio to the extent of the diurnal range in each month, in other words, more sickness prevailed when the temperature was the most varied and less when it was the least so. A tabular statement of the monthly distribution of the rainfall for the four years, from 1867 to 1870, shows the total fall of 1870 to have been 16.15 inches greater than in 1869 and 14.10 greater than in 1868, and 14.13 inches greater than in 1867. In the Bakirgunj station the total rainfall measured by the old gauge was 75.2 inches and by the new gauge only 62.38 inches. At Mymensingh the rainfall was 78.49 inches. At Kachar 107.23 inches. At Chittagong the rainfall was 94.285 inches, or 10 inches below the average of the preceding seven years. The only peculiarity of the year here was the dryness of the season up to the end of July and the unusual rainfall from August to October. At Tipperah the rainfall was 62.51 inches; at Nuakhali 78.52 inches; at Pubna 59.73; at Bogra 8032 inches; at Malda 53.5; at Rajshahi 48.97 inches. At this station during October and November, when cholera was very prevalent in the jail, the meteorological conditions were as follows:-The temperature was greater by 6 than in 1869; the daily range varied 1 to 5, whilst in the corresponding period of 1869 it was uniformly 5. The rainfall was 3.24 inches (the last day being the 28th) in the corres- ponding week of 1869. The barometric pressure was .15 lower than in the same period of 1869; the diurnal range was .02 against .04 in 1869. The prevailing wind was north-east instead of south-east as in 1869. For the first 12 days in November in the mornings the thermometer ranged from 80 to 84, the maximum varying from 84 to 86, the maximum range for the same period of 1869 being 74 to 77, and the maximum from 80 to 81. On the morning of the 14th November, however, the temperature suddenly fell to 76; the days were cloudy, while the temperature continued high; the nights were dewy, when the temperature fell very low. The atmospheric pressure for this period was lower by .14 than in the corresponding period of 1869, the direction of the wind being north-east against south-west in 1869. At Julpaiguri the total rainfall was 167.09 inches for the last eight months of the year. The range of the thermometer was very considerable, especially in February, March, and April, and least in July and August. At Burdwan the total rainfall of 1870 was 43.15 against the average rainfall of 61.41 inches. At Bankurah the total rainfall of 4161 in 1870 was much below the average of the preceding 20 years, which was about 52.73 inches. At Birbhum the rainfall was 62.26 inches. At Deogurh the year 1870 was much cooler than the preceding year. The total rainfall was 478 inches, exceeding that of 1869 by 3.7 inches and that of 1868 by 8 .24 inches. At Ranchi the rainfall was 53.32 inches; at Singhbum 48.81 inches; at Man- bhoom 47.80 inches; at Bhagalpur, 41.04 inches-which is lower than for some years back-at Shahabad 47.13 inches, against 48.25 in 1869, 27.44 in 1868, and 51.95 in 1867, At Gya the fall was 39.51; at Saran 43.32 inches, against 43.00 in 1869, 25.70 in 1868, and 77.17 in 1867. At Tirhut the fall was 79.5 inches, which was more than double that of 1869, which was only 39.5 inches. The country, and especially the station, suffered from scarcity of water and drought during the second quarter of the year. The level of the sub-soil water was observed to have sunk very low at the time the cholera broke out; wells and tanks became dry as the hot season advanced. At Balasore the rainfall was 51.60 inches; the rains set in rather late, continuing till the first week of November. At Cuttack the rains were very irregular, and but for the canals, the whole of the crops would have perished. At Puri the rainfall was 32.46 inches.

Cholera in Bengal Province during the year 1871. Lithographed at the Survey of India Offices, Calcutta, December 1884.
(    57    ) BENGAL PROVINCE, 1871. The monthly mortality registered from cholera among the civil population in 1871 is shown in the annexed tabular statement. The total of deaths is 14,510, against 21,691 in the preceding year. The ratio per mille of popu- lation is 0.25 against 0.70 in 1870. The districts that suffered most severely were those of Rajshahi, Murshidabad, Malda, and Bogra, and in all the months of greatest prevalence were October, November, and December. The rains were excessive and prolonged ; the number of rainy days beyond the average. All these districts suffered from inundation; the disease was generally limited to the submerged tracts and their neighbourhood, and privation, improper food, and exposure to wet and cold are belived to have been greatly instrumental in causing the mortality. In Murshidabad district, a dam on the Bhagiratti river, 22 miles north  of Berhampur, gave away during the month of August  and  inundated  a very considerable tract of country in the interior  of the  district,  carrying away villages,  roads, and bridges,  and causing  great distress  and much sickness. It was  in these tracts that, as the water ran  off and the land  began  to  dry, cholera appeared.    Berhampur itself suffered  little, but there were five  cases and four deaths  in  the  cantonments under circumstances worth recording. At the north-western  corner  of   the  cantonments  is   a block of buildings consisting of three sets of quarters, parallel to the river, and each having a long strip of garden behind it.    The  gardens  of the   end houses are  much  built over but not that of the centre house, which, however, was unoccupied and the garden uncared for * * * and there was a good deal of jungle in   it * * * .    In the beginning of May,  a coachman living in  one  of the out-houses of the most northerly house  was  seized  with  cholera, but recovered.    In June, the gentlemen who occupied that house was attacked  with  the same disease,  and died.    In October, a syce living in the compound of  the house at  the  other extremity of the block of three took cholera and died.    In November, a com- pounder living in a house at the bottom of the garden of the house No. 1 died in three hours from the beginning of his attack.    In all there were five cases in the cantonment during the year, and all  occurred in the too  occupied  houses of this  one block  of   three.    The  Sanitary Committee met, examined most carefully the condition of the compounds, drains,    &c.,    and the state  of the garden, but could find nothing to account for the disease. The figures in the above statement show that  cholera was prevalent in all the other  districts  of the  Bengal  Province  during the year 1871,  but   the disease was generally mild in type, amenable to  treatment, and showed little tendency   to  spread.     Owing   to   the unusually  heavy rainfall in northern India,  the flood  level of  the  Ganges,  and  of   most  of its tributaries,  has been higher than at any time during the  last  ten years, and in almost every district considerable  areas have been inundated either from overflow or from the bursting of  local bunds.    The   local rainfall   has  also   been  excessive, and  contributed  to keep the  country   moist  for a longer period than usual. Over these flooded tracts, where villagers have been driven from their houses and left  shelterless, and their crops  and  property destroyed,  there has been necessarily  much  privation and  exposure,   and it is among such people and in  such  tracts,   during  the period of their drying,  that local  outbreaks of cholera have occurred.    There are a few districts, however, in which the disease was  most prevalent and fatal   during  the past months,  such as Rangpur, which suffered most in April and May;  Tipperah and Dhaka in March  and April; Gya in June and July; and Shahabad in May and June.    In Dhaka, where  cholera existed throughout  March,  the  disease broke out among an assemblage of 400,000 pilgrims, chiefly females; who had come to bathe in the Brahmaputra  at  Nangalband;  fortunately  it  spread  but little among them, and there is no record  of its introduction  by them into other parts  of the district. * * *  In the   Chittagong  Sanitary Report, Civil  Surgeon Dr. F. F. Allen,   mentions  an outbreak  of    cholera  on board a steamer   among  300 coolies  destined for the Lushai expedition.    In this case  overcrowding, filthy babits,  and caste  prejudice  (by causing to fast for long periods rather than cook on board) seem to have been predisposing causes.
(    58   ) The Cholera of 1871 in the Bengal Province prevailed in every one of its 728 registering circles. The following particulars are gathered from the reports of Civil Surgeons:- In Monghyr there were occasional cases in the town and suburbs from the end of May to the close of the year; they were never numerous, did not occur in anything like epidemic sequence, intervals of a week or ten days often elasping without a report. " On the 4th June," writes Dr. T. Mathew, "an elderly convict was seized with cholera. Within the walls of a jail, if anywhere, a Civil Surgeon has every facility for investigating the history of a first case; but in this case I could not make even a satisfactory conjecture as to its source; the prisoner had not been outside the jail for months, had no intercourse with people from outside, and was living under exactly the same conditions as to food, water, employment, &c., as the rest of the prison population. How the cholera found its way to him alone (for there was no other case in the jail) is a mystery." Dr. Mathew states that " in none of the outbreaks reported in the town or suburbs did the disease show any tend- ency to spread," and adds, "this is the history of cholera in non-epidemic seasons, in places such as Monghyr, situated within the endemic limits of the disease; cases occur every year, but if under conditions opposed to its propa- gation, the seizures are few and the attack dies out; let the conditions, however, (and I cannot venture to guess what they are) be favourable to the spread and growth of the poison, the disease assumes an endemic character." In Parnia cholera appeared in the south-east of the district in October in localities where the Ganges had overflowed, and was limited to the area of inundation. The Civil Surgeon, Dr. Picachy, attributes the outbreak to a damp condition of the soil and air, to the destitution, insufficient clothing, and exposure to wet and cold of those affected, together with their use of bad, and especially of uncooked vegetable food. In Patna cholera appeared in the town in August, and also in its neighbourhood, and continued during the three succeeding months. Early in November several suspicious cases of diarrhoea attended with vomiting occurred in the jail. On the 9th and three following days fifteen cholera cases were admitted, of which four died. Two hundred prisoners were at once removed to Digah, where three hours after their arrival three of them were simultaneously attacked, and one man died. Dr. Simpson connects this outbreak with the damp state of the jail wards; the walls were damp to the height of four feet; the flooring was in such a state that in walking over it an impression of the foot was left, and a walking stick could be easily pushed in up to its middle; it was just as this state of things was at its height that cholera broke out. Curiously enough when the floods were at their highest level, reaching in fact to the jail-walls, the wards were quite dry: this excessive damp only made its appearance after the cessation of the rains in October, and at a time when the level of the sub-soil water, as indicated by the wells, had considerably sunk. Hay provided for the prisoners to sleep on, needed drying before it could be used a second time. Isolated cases of cholera were reported from the district throughout the year. In Gya cholera appeared early in June in several places to the west, north-west, and north of the town, and raged epidemically till the middle of July. At Kumani, 45 miles north-west of Gya, the disease raged for a short period, carrying off 15 men, 10 women, and 5 children in the space of a few days. The Civil Surgeon, Dr. Russel, writes:-It " appeared to me to be a very singular circumstance why this village was singled out by the disease, pounced upon as it were, while all the other villages in the immediate neighbourhood remained intact. The village in question was not in any degree more crowded than the other surrounding villages, and there were no cesspool, foul drainage, or the like to account for the predeliction." In Shahabad cholera was rife in Sasseram sub-division during May and June ; the majority of the few cases reported in the town of Arrah turned out on inspection to be ordinary bowel-complaints, due to errors in diet. Dr. Thornton remarks that intestinal worms appeared in some instances to have been the exciting cause of attacks resembling cholera. In October and November also cholera was reported from Buxar and its neighbourhood; but both from inquiry and personal observation, Dr. Thornton was induced
?(59) to believe that nearly all the cases were really due to diarrhoea, dysentery, and other bowel affections.   This opinion is also shared by Dr. Wright of Buxar. In Rajshahye cholera existed during the entire year, and in November assumed an epidemic form in the whole of the district east, north-east, partially north and west of the Sadar station, Mandat, in the extreme north alone enjoying singular immunity. The district was extensively inundated, and Dr. Bensely considers that the privation and distress to which the villagers were thereby subjected, especially predisposed them to the disease. In Midnapur there were only a few sporadic cases here and there, Dr. Mathew remarks that while pilgrims have long been considered one of the principal sources of the disease, although large numbers of them passed through the high lands of the district and the town, they failed to import the disease, and that so far as he could learn, it would appear that the parts of the district through which pilgrims pass year after year have been hitherto least trampled by this scourge. He adds that dysentery and fever-the result of bad food and water, exposure and fatigue-and not cholera, are the causes of the heavy mortality among pilgrims. The Orissa district enjoyed comparative immunity from cholera during 1871. In Cuttack there were but few cases reported from the district, very few in the town, and none in the jail, which suffered severely in 1870. In Balasore there was comparative freedom from cholera, notwithstanding that a very large number of pilgrims passed through the district. In Puri there was no epidemic this year-a most unusual circumstance-as the disease breaks out annually in June or July, when the pilgrims arrive; not a single case came under the Civil Surgeon's observation. Reports of suspected cases were received, but on enquiry they turned out to be cases of diarrhoea and dysentery. Dr. Stewart, the Civil Surgeon, attributes this immunity rather to the steady and free rainfall from February to October than to any of the sanitary arrangements made at the last rathjatra. In the Chota Nagpur district also there was comparative immunity from cholera in 1871. (From the Report by Dr. C. J. Jackson, Officiating Sanitary Commissioner for Bengal for 1871). The incidence of the cholera of 1871 among the troops and jails of this province is shown in the subjoined abstract statements. Among the European troops-total average strength 3,744-there were altogether 10 admissions and 6 deaths from cholera, giving a death-rate of 1.60 per mille of strength. Of the five stations occupied by the European troops, the three following recorded cholera in 1871:- Dum-Dum     ...                ... Strength    672 Admissions     2 Deaths   1 Hazaribagh   ...  887  1  0 Dinapore  881  7  5 The strength of the affected troops is 2,440, the percentage of admissions to strength is 0.41, and of deaths to admissions 60. Of the 10 admissions there were 1 in June, 1 in July, 6 in November and 2 in December. Among the families of the European soldiers there were the following admissions and deaths from cholera in 1871 :- Women-total average strength 306-admissions 3 and deaths 3. Of the five stations occupied by women, the two following recorded cholera in 1871:- Hazaribagh.   ...                 ... Strength       87 Admissions      2 Deaths    2 Dinapore        ...            ,,             100        1  1 The strength of the affected women is 187, the percentage of admissions to strength 160, and of deaths to admissions 100. Of the 3 admissions 2 were in June, and 1 in December. Children-total average strength 709-there was no cholera. Among the native troops-total average strength 2,745-there were altogether 7 admissions and 5 deaths from cholera, giving a death-rate of 1.82 per mille of strength. Of the six stations occupied by navive troops, five recorded cholera in 1871:- The strength of the affected troops is 2,631, the percentage of admissions to strength 0.37, and of deaths to admissions 71. Of the 7 admissions, there were 2 April, 2 in October, 1 in November, and 2 in December. I 2
?(    60    ) Among the jail populations-total average strength 17,021-there were altogether 131 admissions and 41 deaths from cholera, giving a death-rate of 241 per mille of strength. Of the 49 jails in the province, 22 returned cholera in 1871. The strength of the 22 affected jails is 10,170, the percentage of admissions to strength 129, and of deaths to admissions 31. Of the 131 admissions there were 5 in January, 12 in February, 12 in March, 17 in April, 13 in May, 5 in June, 8 in July, 5 in August, 7 in September, 15 in October, 24 in November, and 8 in December. Compared with the corresponding returns for the preceding year, the figures for 1871 show a very marked decline in the prevalence of cholera among the troops and jails of this province. This is in exact accordance with the triennial cycle of cholera prevalence already alluded to in a previous passage. The year 1871 is the third or " minimum of prevalence " year of the sixth triennial period of the series we have given statistics for from 1854 to 1871, inclusive. Meteorology.-The following brief sketch of the chief meteorological characteristics of the year 1871 are from the admirable Report of Mr. H. F. Blanford, Meteorological Reporter to the Government. Atmospheric Pressure-Was above the average during January and February at all stations except Darjeeling, and during March at all except Darjeeling, Chittagong, and Monghyr. In April it remained lower at Hazari- bagh, and to a less degree at Kattak, Calcutta, Dhaka, and Patna, but was relatively higher than the average at Darjeeling, Chittagong, Monghyr, Jaisur, and especially so at Berhampur. In May it was generally above the average, and most so at Berhampur and Monghyr. In June it continued higher at Berhampur, Monghyr, and Darjeeling, but fell everywhere else, and was especially low at Kattak and Dhaka. During the south-western monsoon it was above the mean at Chittagong, Dhaka, Jaisur, Monghyr, Darjiling, and except during the month of July at Barhampur also. In October and November the pressure was everywhere below the mean, and in December also, except at Kattak and Patna. Temperature of the Air.-In January  1871   the  mean temperature of the  delta was a little below the average of the four years, the greatest depres- sion being at Jaisur.    It was also below the same average at Kattak.    On the other  hand,  on  both  coasts  of the  Bay  and in Bihar the temperature was somewhat higher than the average.    In February the temperature was  above the  mean everywhere.    The  greatest  success was at Barhampur, and at this place, Dhaka, Hazaribagh, and Patna it exceeded  2.    In March and April the temperature again fell gradually below the average; first in the delta and lower part of the Gangetic plain, and afterwards more generally, Patna, Hazari- bagh, and the stations on the east side of the Bay being the last to remain above the mean.    In May, owing doubtless to the early commencement of the rains, the depression of temperature below the average was universal, amount- ing to between 3 and 4  at Kattak,  Jaisur, Hazaribagh,  Barhampur, and Monghyr.    All the stations enumerated, except Patna, and temporarily one or two other stations, continued to enjoy a temperature below the average up to the end of the rains.    In October, however, the fall of temperature was less than usual, and  November and December were warmer than usual at nearly all the stations enumerated, especially at Kattak and  Patna.   Temperature of the  solar  radiation as  compared  with the  preceding year,  for which alone complete observations are available,  the  temperature  of solar radiation was generally  greater in  January  and February 1871, and generally less in May, in June, and more or less  throughout the  rains,   it was less at places lying south of the latitude of Calcutta, and greater at places to the north. Humidity.-The deviations of the humidity of each month of 1871 from the average at different stations appear to have been very irregular. The humidity was exceptionally high at Patna during the first five months of the year, equal to it in July and August, and below the average during the last four months. It was generally a little above the average in February, except at Dhaka and stations on the coast line. In March this was the case only in the delta and lower Gangetic plain. In April this excess increased, and in May and June was very general. During the rains the difference became less, and in October the humidity was generally at or a little below the average.
(    61    ) In November and December the humidity was somewhat greater than usual at False Point, Sagar, and Calcutta; in November at Darjeeling also; but at Patna decidedly below the mean in both months. On the whole in 1871 the air was unusually moist. Rainfall.-The rainfall of 1871 was unusually heavy in northern India. In Calcutta it was the greatest on record, exceeding even that of 1868; and in many parts of the country the floods on the low-lands were of such extent and depth as to breach the railways and cause serious interruption to the traffic. In the tea districts of Eastern Bengal, in Lower Assam, and in the intervening plateau of the Khasi Hills the rainfall was considerably below the average. Cherapunji received less than three-fifths of its usual quantity. In Upper Assam the excess was very great, amounting to one-third more than the average fall. In Orissa, again, as far west as it was greatly in excess in the western part of the Gangetic delta, in Chota Nagpur, in Northern Bihar, and Tirhut; it was exceedingly heavy at Chaprah, where it was more than double the average quantity, and at Sewan. January was a dry month throughout Bengal, and February scarcely less so. In March there were some heavy showers, especially in the Midnapur district; and in Lower Bengal the rain- fall in the month was about twice or three times the average quantity. In April the rainfall was frequent and copious, and extended over the whole of Bengal and Bihar. May was in all respects like an average June, except in the districts north of the delta and in Assam, where, with local exceptions, the fall was not heavier than usual. From this time up to the end of Septem- ber the rain poured on steadily in somewhat greater quantity than usual, and in the latter month, just before the close of the rains, an excessively heavy fall took place in Tirhut and the adjoining districts of Chaprah and Champaran. The last three months of the year, on the whole, were drier than usual. Wind.-The winds of Bengal, during the first three months of 1871 where such are usual at the time of year, except that in the early part of January they were somewhat more northerly. In April the fall of atmospheric pressure in Bihar and Western Bengal was accompanied by a great weakening of the land winds in that region, and by a veering of those of the delta towards south south-east and south-east. In May there was a decided excess of easterly elements, and in the latter half of the month the winds were such as characterise the south-west monsoon, but more easterly than usual, especially in Bihar. During these months the velocity of the winds was much below the average, and this again is characteristic of the monsoon as contrasted with the hot-weather. This excess of easterly winds continued during June, and it was not until July that the monsoon assumed its normal character. On the return of the winter monsoon in October and November, the land winds set in much as usual in Bihar, but in Bengal were less steady, and up to the close of the year the west or north-west winds were weaker than the average. On the whole, the year 1871 was characterised by early and excessive rainfall, a temperature lower during the hot months and rains, but somewhat above the average during November and December, a greater amount of humidity and of cloud; more easterly winds in April, May, and June; and generally throughout the year, weaker winds than usual. Food-supply.-No reliable information is available regarding the prices of the principal food-grains, or the p. ices of labour in the several districts of the Bengal Province for 1871. The inundations above alluded to caused considerable damage to the crops over some extended areas, and produced more or less local suffering and distress among the poorest classes; but there does not appear to have been any wide spread or general distress or scarcity from these causes.

Cholera in Bengal Province during the year 1872. Lithographed at the Survey of India Offices, Calcutta, December 1884.
(    65    ) BENGAL PROVINCE,  1872. For the first time the mortuary registration returns for Bengal are complete in this year. The monthly mortality registered from cholera among the civil population in 1872 is shown in the annexed tabular statement. The total of deaths is 37,536, or at the rate of 0.63 per mille of population under registration. In his report on the cholera of this year, the Sanitary Commissioner for Bengal, Dr. O. J. Jackson, writes.-" There are two periods in the year when cholera is especially apt to prevail in Bengal, viz., in the hot, summer months, and the cold, damp months of October, November, and December. Within the endemic area, cholera prevails nearly all the year round, but its general period of increase and fatality is during the cold and moist months. There are some districts within this area where it is apt to prevail extensively both in summer and winter, and this is especially likely to be the case where there has been any very excessive development of the disease during the previous cold season. It lulls during transition months, increases in the hot season, diminishes in the rains, and breaks out as unusual in the cold-weather again, While in a third series of districts, viz. those which lie towards the north-west, or which are just on the boundary of the endemic tract, the summer season is that of augmentation." The following particulars are gathered from the details recorded of the prevalence of the disease in the different districts. Burdwan.-Cholera was endemic in the district throughout the year under review, most virulent in December, and most mild in July, but in no place did it assume an epidemic form. * * * The greatest number of reported cases occurred in the north-western thana of Niamatpur, where during the year there were 224 deaths. Bankura.-Sudden outbreaks of cholera, sporadic in character, but of a virulent type, occurred from time to time in various parts of the district, but chiefly in localities inhabited by the poorer classes, promoted by a total disregard of the laws of sanitation, and the filthy, irregular, and intem- perate habits of the people. In the towns and villages through which pilgrims travelled, the disease appeared more frequently, and the deaths were more numerous in those places in which they halted. Birbhum.-Cholera, endemic in character, prevailed in the villages in loca- lities which differ entirely as to physical conditions. Some of these villages are filthy, low, and situated near the bed of the river, which, owing to the silting at its mouth, is converted into a sluggish stream during the rains, and is at other periods of the year a shallow lake, or rather a swamp, some are on the low alluvium, others on the laterite or older alluvium, and others, again, on the rock. The disregard of the commonest sanitary rules is observable in them all. Midnapur.-Cholera is endemic in Midnapur, and rarely occurs in a serious epidemic form. The disease visited various parts of the district in 1872; it never made a long stay in any one place, and did not assume an epidemic aspect. Hugli.-Cholera visited this district during the year, and prevailed virulently in remote villages. Howrah.-Cases of cholera of a mild type occurred in the district throughout the year. They were especially prevalent in October, November, and December in the interior of the district, and sporadically in the town of Howrah and in the villages contiguous to it. 24-Pergunnahs.-Cholera in a sporadic form lingered in this district throughout the year, exhibiting a tendency to become epidemic in Diamond Harbour, Barripur, Dam-Dam, and Satkhira. At the close of the preceding year--26th and 27th December 1871-6 cases of cholera occurred in a European boarding-house in Russel-street, Chowringhi; 2 of the cases terminated fatally, 1 in the house and the other at Ghazipur on the the third day after the patient's departure from Calcutta. Under the orders of Government a committee was appointed to enquire into and report on the causes of the outbreak. The main facts elicited in connection with the outbreak were K
(    66    ) these. Although the town of Calcutta was comparatively free from cholera in December, the disease was present in some of the suburbs; and in Bhowanipur especially a good many cases occurred throughout the month; and a very distinctly marked house-epidemic took place in the house of a Babu, in which 1 case occurred on the 22nd December, 2 on the 23rd, 2 on the 24th, and 3 on the 26th. Of the 8 cases, 4 proved fatal. During the latter part of December also severe outbreaks occurred in the Howrah district and in villages near Atchipur and Budge-Budge." * * * During December only 3 cases of cholera-all sailors from vessels, situated in different parts of the river-were admitted in the General Hospital, viz. 2 on the 29th and the third on the 31st December. A case of cholera also occurred in Elysium Row on the 27th December. The circumstances of the outbreak in Russell- street are as follows:-On the 23rd December a Mr. Tracey, his wife, and a Madrasi man-servant came to the boarding-house from the mission establish- ment at Bhowanipur, were they had been previously residing. No cases of cholera had occurred on these premises either before they left, or in fact up to the time the committee made their report. The first case at the boarding- house was that of Mr. Tracey. He fell ill on the 26th December 1871 at 6 A.M., but thought that it was only one of his usual dyspeptic fits. After breakfast he went out with his wife shopping, and returned at 1 P.M., still feeling unwell with purging; vomiting soon came on, and at 5 P.M. he was fast passing into collapse, from which he never rallied; he died at 10-30 A.M. the next day. His wife was taken ill on the evening of the 27th December, and returned to the missionary institution at Bhowanipur. She suffered from cholerine, checked by full doses of liquor opii sed: and diluted sulphuric acid, and ultimately recovered. The Madrasi servant, who ate and drank the same food and water as his master, was also attacked with cholera at No. 4, Russell-street on the 27th December. He ultimately recovered, and was the only native about Mrs. Herring's premises affected by the disease. A Mrs. Hendman, residing on the top flat of No. 5 Russell-street, was with Mr. Tracey during his illness on Tuesday afternoon, throughout the subsequent night, and on Wednesday morning until his death. * * * She felt ill during the night, but no symptoms of cholera began until she got home on the 27th; she recovered. Mrs. Wimberley, living on the lower floor of No. 3, Russell-street, was attacked with cholera on the 27th December, and recovered. Archdeacon Pratt, who lived on the second floor of No. 5, Russell- street, left Calcutta on the night of the 25th, and proceeded to Ghazipur. He arrived there at 10 P.M. on the 26th; was attacked with cholera on the forenoon on the 27th; and died on the 28th. In all there were six cases of cholera and two deaths. The immediate neighbourhood of Nos. 3, 4, and 5, Russell-street, in which the cases occurred, has been free of the disease, so far as the European inhabit- ants are concerned, for months past. These three form a boarding establish- ment under the management of Mrs. Herring, who lives in No. 5 Russell-street, and from a kitchen in this house the food and water are supplied to all the lodgers on the establishment. These premises are situated in a healthy and well-drained locality; and the only feature apparently distinguishing the houses from the others in the immediate neighbourhood is to be found in their water- supply; water is not laid on in them, but is brought in from the nearest stand-pipes. This is done by two bhisties, who bring water to all three houses in their mussuks. * * * The milkman supplying milk to the estab- lishment also lives in Bhowanipur. * * * Very many of the houses throughtout Chowringhi are supplied by milkmen living in the same suburb. * * * Immediately to the rear of the huts in which these milkmen live there is one of the dirty tanks so common to the suburbs of Calcutta, * * * and it is almost certain that the milk supplied by the milkman contained the water of some tank. Nuddia.-A few cases of cholera, needing no remarks, occurred in this district in the same localities which had been previously affected by fevers In the district generally the disease prevailed sporadically, but in several parts it assumed an epidemic form in continuance of an outbreak in the preceding December, which did not fianally subside till the end of April 1872. The circles of Bongaon, Ranaghat, and Birnagar were most severely affected.
(   67   ) Jaisr.-Cholera of a sporadic character, but neither very violent nor very formidable, visited all parts of the district at the usual seasons for such outbreaks. The police of the district suffered most, as they generally do in the low swampy districts of Bengal, from fatigue, privation and exposure to the vicissitudes of weather. Murshidabad.-Cholera pervaded the entire district during this year, and it was noted that the number of cases and deaths had fallen off from 700 and 659, respectively in 1871, to 645 and 442 during 1872; that the disease prevailed with the greatest severity in the south-west, south, and south-east por- tions of the district, in which 382 casualties (70 per cent.) of the total mortality of the year, occurred; and that along the main roads and river banks, where traffic was greatest, the disease prevailed with less intensity, continuity, and fatality than in the country west of the Bhagirathi, which is the high, open, and better drained, and as a rule free from rank vegetation. Of the 14 registration circles in the district, only one was free from cholera, three had but one case each, and in seven the cases reported were those remaining over from the close of the previous year." With respect to the causes and patho- logy of the disease in Murshidabad, Dr. Coates writes:-" Cholera is endemic, but more prevalent in the cold and early hot seasons. Anything that disturbs digestion is liable to induce it. New rice, fresh vegetables, fresh fruits, all uncooked food, foul water, and indigestable substances give rise to it. In no case has its been observed to be contagious. I cannot state the effect of caste, age, sex, and habits, except that females are less subject to it than males, and that irregular eating and living seem favourable to its onset." Dinagepur.-Generally endemic in this district, cholera assumed an en- demic form this year. The disease commenced in Birganj, 18 miles north of the station of Dinagepur, and spread gradually to the south, affecting lastly, so late as the end of December, the station itself and Rajbanspur, three miles distant from it. Rangpur.-The very severe epidemic of cholera that prevailed during the close of 1871 in the eastern portion of this district lying between the rivers Brahmaputra, and on that lying between the junction of that river with the Dhazla and the Tista, until the end of February. The returns show the disease to have been prevalent throughout the year 1872, and with marked increase of mortality in the last three months of the year, which was owing to two outbreaks of cholera-one in nine villages within a two mile radius of the Bhowaniganj police station, where within the nine weeks of its preva- lence 513 cases were reported, the other in the north-east of the district, where it persisted with great intensity to the end of February (1873). While cholera is epidemically present in this district throughout the year, and often causes great mortality, it also prevails epidemically in certain localities and at certain seasons. Maldah.-Cholera, sporadic in character, is said to have prevailed throughout the district in almost every month of the year. The month of August was the most fatal for those attacked in the town of Maldah, and out of 49 cases that occurred throughout the district, 49 terminated fatally. The returns show only 52 deaths in the district during the year, the highest number being 14, 11, and 9 in February, August, and January, respectively. Rajshahi.-The cholera which had broke out at Nathor in 1871, and still prevailed at the close of that year, appears to have continued in the district in an active form during the first four months of 1872. The months of October, November, and December, when there is generally an epidemic of cholera, are noted as having been singularly free of the disease this year. Bogra.-Cholera of a sporadic character occurred in this district monthly in the cool months. * * * Pubna.-No mention of cholera in the sanitary report of this district. Darjeeling.-In 1872 cholera of a severe epidemic character pervaded the entire district of Darjeeling, chiefly exhibiting its virulence among the cooly lines of the tea estates, the terai, particularly the crowded tracts, and the hill country. It extended its ravages also to the tracts beyond the river Tista. The cooly corps that accompanied the Lushai Expedition, and which cholera had attacked previously, was diminished at Jalpaiguri between the 15th and 20th April, and on the 19th the disease broke out in the terai. In May K 2
(   68   ) cholera assumed an active form, and spread, but not rapidly; it prevailed with the greatest intensity in the plantations at the foot of the hills, and thus travelled over the new cart road into the hills, causing in its passage great havoc in the tea plantations. On the 27th May the first case, ending fatally, occurred in the bazar at Darjeeling in the person of a Mahomedan carpenter. At the Civil Surgeon's recommendation the hut in which this man died was burnt down the same night. The second, and last, case in the station was that of a duftry, who was attacked the next day, and who was ascertained to have had no communication with the people of the terai. The returns represent only a portion of the cholera mortality in this district in 1872. This was due partly to want of organization among the planters in collecting the data, and partly to unwillingness on their part, due to fear of Government inter- ference, to furnish a full return of deaths that occurred in their estates, * * * also to the fact that wherever cholera appeared, the coolies ran away in large numbers, and scattered themselves in the jungle. In connection with this out- break it is stated that in two cases infants at the breast did not catch the infection from their mothers, who were attacked by and died from cholera; that when the huts in which the disease had broken out had been burnt down, the disease disappeared from their locality. * * * The Civil Surgeon's report on this cholera outbreak records 751 deaths in 10 of the tea plantations; the mortuary statements of the year record only 205 deaths. Julpaiguri.-The outbreak of cholera here was also credited to importa- tion by the cooly corps which was disbanded at Julpaiguri in April, the men finding re-employment in the tea gardens at Kurseong and the Terai. The mortuary returns, however, show the disease to have been present in this district from the commencement of the year. The first case in the station of Julpaiguri occurred on the 17th May, and on the following day the disease appeared in the jail. Faridpur.-The cholera which was prevailing at Goalando, Kasami, and other places in the preceding December, continued active during January 1872, and caused considerable mortality. The disease prevailed with greater intensity in the south, where the river water which was being used by the people, was at that time stagnant and rendered noxious by the bathing and washing of clothes in it. The Commissioner was of opinion that the occurrence of the disease was inevitable owing to the misery that had been caused by the inundation, and that it was surprising that its attack was not more destructive. By the end of 1872 the disease had become diffused throughout the district, and prevailed with considerable virulence during the last week of the year; 360 deaths were reported. Dhaka.-Contrary to the experience of the preceding four years, the district at large was singularly free from the ravages of cholera in 1872, excepting in November and December. The first case in the city of Dhaka occurred on the 21st March; on the 15th April four more cases with three deaths; no more cases were beard of at this time nor in May, although the great bathing festival of the Brahmaputra had collected at a place 15 miles east of the city many thousands of pilgrims from different and remote parts of Bengal. In June and July a few cases were heard of, and in August and September there was an outbreak with 16 deaths among a number of coolies who had come from Monghyr for labour at the jute factories; the outbreak among them was attributed to excessive overcrowding, bad food, inordinate eating at unusual hours, and polluted water; the disease then spread all over the city, and continued rife till the close of the year. Children were attacked in much greater numbers than adults, and although rare in occurrence in other years, more than one member of a family suffered at the same time during this year. The Civil Surgeon, Dr. Wise, writes-"Natives of the city implicitly believe that rain in November postpones the annual outbreaks of cholera, and my experience corroborates this opinion." Bakirganj.-Cholera is really endemic in this district, and appears to travel from north to south and back again. It is usually heard of as advancing in the beginning of the cold season from Dacca into the northern villages of Bakirganj, increasing in intensity and continuity in December, and abating in virulence with the setting in of the warm-weather and the south- winds.
(    69    ) Mymensingh.-Cholera, which is endemic in this district, also prevailed throughout the year generally, November and December being the months in which it caused the greatest mortality. Chittagonj.-Cholera prevailed epidemically throughout the district during the whole year. The returns show the mortality of the year to have been lowest in the months of August, September, and October. Low-lying, damp localities, where the drinking-water was impure, and no attention was paid to conservancy, suffered most. Noakhali.-Sporadic cases of cholera, confined to limited localities, appeared at different times during the first six and two last months of the year, and for short periods. In January the disease attacked Shaibghatta, a cluster of villages within a mile of the sadr station, and died out in a month after killing 15 persons. These villages had been free of the disease during the preceding five years. In May a trifling outbreak occurred in Awaj Balia, another group of villages two miles from the sadr station. Nine cases occurred, with four deaths. The next was an isolated case in the west of the sadr station. In November the sadr station was attacked, 16 cases with 6 deaths were reported, and the disease continued in the station without spreading to the neighbourhood up to date of report. Tipperah. - Cholera prevalent in many parts of the district. Patna.- For the first time since 1857 the Mitapur Jail was exempt from this disease. * * * With a view to test the efficiency of sanitary improvements in arresting cholera in a locality where it is endemic, a scheme for sub-soil drainage of the jail and its precincts, and for providing better work-sheds had been proposed to Government. The Inspector-General of Hospitals disapproved of these measures on the ground that no satisfactory conclusions could be derived from the improvements in question unless an efficient system of quarantine was established. The Government of Bengal concurred in these views, but the Government of India was of opinion that the improvements should be carried out in their simple form without quaran- tine. Neither of the plans was given effect to; and considering that no other new sanitary peculiarities had been inaugurated in the jails during the year, Dr. Simpson lays stress upon these facts as proving the fallacy of the arrange- ments of those who attribute immunity from cholera to either segregation or sanitary improvements. The returns show cholera to have been present in the district throughout the year. During June, July, and August the disease attained some considerable prevalence, specially at Bihar, Silan, and Atarsarri. In June there was an outbreak at Dinapur also, which by the 15th July had attacked 41 persons, including a European soldier, and caused 25 deaths. At Dehri the first case occurred in the jail, on the 23rd July, and the last on the 30th August; there were 46 cases with 14 deaths. The greatest number of admissions into hospital was on the 30th July, viz., 13 out of the 46 cases, and this fact the Superintendent is of opinion, markedly illus- trates the evil effects of chill when cholera is present, for a remarkably sudden fall of temperature took place about that time. It had been raining from the 18th to the 28th July, there was, however, no diminution of temperature during this period, but on the 28th the thermometer fell and continued low up to the 30th, on which day the great and sudden increase of cholera cases above referred to occurred. It was also remarked that while during this outbreak in the jail the outside population of Dehri was free from the disease, on the other hand the jail enjoyed immunity from it during November and December, when the disease prevailed with great virulence in the cooly lines close to the Superintendent's house. The drainage of the jail is defective, and to this defect the Superintendent is disposed to attribute the origin of much of the malarious disease as well as cholera that had lately prevailed. It strikes him that within a limited enclosure surrounded by walls and with only two kutcha drains as outlets, the soil must, when the rainfall is heavy, become unduly humid, sodden in fact, and when in that condition, with a subsequently hot sun, and perhaps dry wind passing over it, a greater diminution of temperature must take place. Gya.-Cholera was prevalent in some portion of the district throughout the year, and prevailed with the greatest intensity during the months of May to August.* * * In the town of Gya a few cases occurred at intervals, and
?(70) Sherghotty and Aurangabad, the northerly and westerly portions of the district, enjoyed comparative immunity from the disease. Shahabad.--Cholera visited many parts of the districts between April and November, prevailing with great virulence in June and July. Tirhut.--Cholera appeared in Darbhanga in the east, and Sheohar in the north of the district in May, and at the end of the month was present in the sadr station of Muzaffarpur, where the last case occurred on the 10th Novem- ber. Tajpur was affected on the 8th June. The total number of deaths reported by the police was 1,545, but the Civil Surgeon believes that the mor- tality was greater; the returns show a total of only 1,490 deaths. The jail was affected on the 8th August, and up to the 26th of that month there were 79 cases with 36 deaths. Sarun.--Cholera was present in this district nearly throughout the year. In August there was an outbreak of cholera, causing 115 deaths at Burauli in the Sewan circle; the disease abated in October. Champarun.--Cholera did not prevail epidemically in this district. Its visits were sudden and confined to limited tracts, appearing and vanishing from one portion of the district to visit another, and again appearing at the place it had previously visited. Never continuing long in one place, it did not attack large numbers. Its greatest prevalence was in the north-west of the district, the south and west suffered in a minor degree, and the eastern portion was scarcly affected at all. The mortality from this disease was not very great, and occurred chiefly among the previously ailing and the aged. Monghyr.--Cholera in endemic form prevailed throughout the district during the ten months of the year, particularly from May to August. Bhagalpur.--The district is never entirely free from cholera, which was present, though never in an epidemic form, during the whole year. Purnia.--Cholera was present in this district throughout the year, but in no locality was the mortality excessive. Sonthal.--There is no history of cholera for this year in this district. A few cases of sporadic cholera are stated by the Civil Surgeon to have occurred in the town of Deogurh in December. Kattak.--Cholera was prevalent in this district throughout the year. In the town of Kattak comparatively few cases occurred. The disease was prevalent chiefly among the pilgrims to and from Puri along the routes taken by them, and there were a great many cases among some large gangs of coolies employed on irrigation works. Puri.--After an entire absence from this district in 1871, cholera visited it during this year. The returns show its presence in every month throughout the year. Many deaths occurred among the pilgrims who passed through Khonda. On the whole the disease confined itself to the villages near the main traffic roads. The incidence of the cholera of 1872 among the troops and jail popula- tions in this province is shown in the subjoined abstract statements. Among the European troops--total average strength 3,6 2--there were altogether 5 admissions and 4 deaths from cholera, giving a death-rate of 109 of strength. Of the 5 stations occupied by European troops, the 3 follow- ing recorded cholera in 1872 :-- Fort William                  Strength  828 Admissions  2 Deaths    1 Barrackpore                       444       1  1 Dinapur                           829  2  2 The strength of the affected troops is 2,101, the percentage of admissions to strength 024, and of deaths to admissions 80. Of the 5 admissions, there were 2 in July, 1 in September, 1 in November, and 1 in December. Among the families of the European soldiers the following cholera inci- dence in 1872 is recorded. Women-total average strength 383-there was no cholera. Children- total average strength 677-admissions 1, death 1, viz., at Dum-Dum- strength 118--in November. Among the native troops-total average strength 4,910--there were alto- gether 17 admissions and 8 deaths from cholera, giving a death-rate of 163

Of the 17 admissions, there were 3 in April, 2 in May, 1 in June, 2 in July, 3 in August, 1 in September, 2 in October, 1 in November, and 2 in December. Among the jail populations-total average strength 18,416-there were altogether 305 admissions and 128 deaths from cholera, giving a death-rate of 695 per mille of strength.

Of the 305 admissions there were 14 in January, 4 in February, 18 in March, 18 in April, 38 in May, 14 in June, 55 in July, 125 in August, 11 in September, 5 in October, 3 in No- vember, and 20 in December. Hazaribagh.-" Cholera visited this district on the 28th March, confining itself to the northern, portion and never assuming a virulent or epidemic form. The town of Chattra, the great mart of the division, presented very few cases. The sadr station of Hazaribagh and Kimar enjoyed entire immunity from the disease. In the town of Ichak only one case occurred-a remarkable exception, since in previous years the disease generally originated in this place and spread over the whole length and breadth of the district." Lohardagga and Singhbhum-districts both enjoyed comparative immunity from cholera this year. The total deaths reported in the first being 46, and in the other only 27. Manbhum.-" Cholera never epidemic in character, and brief in duration at any one place," prevailed somewhat " in May and June at the setting in of the rains."
(   72   ) Meteorology, Atmospheric  Pressure -"  In  January and February  the pressure was abnormally high all over Bengal except Cuttack,  where it was lower than usual in March.    Except at Chittagong, Goalpara,  and Darjeeling, where it remained unusually  high,  the pressure was  everywhere below  the average, excessively so in Orissa.    In April it continued high at Darjeeling, but was low at Goalpara, and remained below the average in Orissa.    In May it was unusually high in  Darjeeling, Goalpara, and somewhat  so in Eastern Bengal; in Orissa it continued lower than the average, and also at the coast stations round the northern part of the Bay  of Bengal.    In June and July there was a higher pressure than usual everywhere  save at the head of the Bay, where stormy weather prevailed,  and a  cyclone  was  formed at the end of June.    In August the pressure  fell everywhere,  especially  in  Behar  and Orissa, and continued low over the Bay of Bengal.    In September the pressure increased to somewhat  above the average,  especially  over  Lower Bengal to the west of the delta.    A cyclone crossed the delta near Jessore on the 20th. In October, November,  and December,  the pressure was  everywhere below the average, the Bay of Bengal included. Temperature of the Air.-The temperature was above the average during the first six months of the year at Cuttack, False Point, and Saugor Island, especially in March. In February the temperature in Bengal generally was two or three degrees lower, and in March three or four degrees higher than usual. April and May were hotter than usual, except in Eastern Bengal. In June, owing to the absence of rain, the temperature remained unusually high; but in the latter part of the rainy season and in October it fell to a little below the average. In July and the succeeding months Behar was unusually hot. In November and December the temperature was above the average almost everywhere. Humidity.-The air was more humid than usual throughout the year at Dhaka and False Point. At Darjeeling it was less humid during the same period. The humidity of the air was above the average at Dhaka and False Point, and lower than the average at Darjeeling, throughout the year. At Cuttack the first seven months were drier, and the last five damper than usual. At Patna the first half of the year was damper, and the remainder drier than the average. As regards Bengal as a whole, January was more damp than usual, in February and March the humidity lessened, in April it fell below the average, and continued to fall all June; in August it rose rapidly above the average, fell again in September, after which date it increased till the end of the year, December having the greatest abnormal humidity. Rainfall.-This was unusually light, being 15 inches at Calcutta, 16 at Kishnagarh, 18 inches at Bardwan, 30 inches at Saugor Island, 233/4 at Bogra, 183/4 at Mymesingh, and at Dhaka nearly 11 inches below the average. Tipperah, Northern Bengal, and Western and South-Western Behar had also a diminished rainfall. Over a few small areas, e.g., Berhampur, Suri, Jaisur, Naokhali, Champaran, Tirhut, Chota Nagpur south of the Damuda, at Sambalpur, and in Assam and Orissa, the fall was above the average. Wind.-The land winds from the Upper Provinces were weak in Janu- ary, stronger in February, normal in March as regards strength, but with an excess of southerly elements. In April north-west winds predominated in Cuttack, and westerly winds were unusually prevalent at Hazaribagh. In June westerly winds still predominated in Orissa, while in Behar and the delta south and east winds prevailed. In July, August and September, the direction of the wind was normal, but the usual westerly winds were either weak or absent in Orissa and  Western Bengal. In November and December also there was a deficiency of westerly winds. Summary -The chief meteorological features in Bengal in 1872 were:- 1, deficient rainfall; 2, weak westerly winds; 3, an increased number of storms in the Bay at the beginning and close of the monsoon; 4, diminished atmospheric pressure over the north of the Bay, and increased pressure in the south-east of the Bay, especially during the first six months. (From Mr. H. F. Blanford's report.) Food-supply.-On the whole, except in those districts where there was a high mortality and a general prostration of the people from epidemic fevers, so as to interfere with cultivation and cause a local rise in the price of food, there seems to have been no scarcity in 1872.

?(    76   ) BENGAL PROVINCE, 1873. The monthly mortality registered from cholera among the Civil popu- lation in 1873 is shownin the annexed tabular statement. The total of deaths is 59,830, or at the rate of 094 per mille of the population under registration. The returns for 1873 show an increase of 22.294 deaths from cholera as compared with the total number registered in 1872. Part of this increase is owing to more accurate and improved registration, but mostly to an actual increase in the prevalence of cholera in 1873 over that in the preceding year. In both years the month of October shows the lowest amount of mortality as compared with the other months of the year. The months of January and December, which in 1872 showed the highest monthly mortality, in 1873 show a very reduced number of deaths, the figures being, respectively 4,711 and 6,314 in 1872, against 3,924 and 3,422, respectively in 1873. Burdwan.-In this district cholera prevailed in three of the southern circles at the close of 1872, and continued active in them during January 1873, the deaths being in all 375. In February the disease persisted in these circles, and also appeared in others in the north-east of the district. During both months cholera was present in Burdwan, and is said to have been more virulent than elsewhere. In the first half of March the disease appeared at Raniganj, on the extreme north-west, and in the east also, and persisted during the month in the south and centre of the district. In April the disease was severe in the south-west, and on the 26th appeared in the women's wards of the Burdwan Jail, and on the 29th among the male prisoners. In May there were some severe local outbreaks, but the disease on the whole was abating. In June the abatement was more marked, and after this month the disease gradually diminished, smouldered, flickered, and died out. The features presented by the cholera of 1873 in this district are thus described:- " It was frequent in occurrence; limited in extent; of short duration; and erratic in manner, proceeding from village to village, and retuning to already visited localities after a week or so; attacking a few at a time. It was present somewhere or other during every month of the year, except the two last, and was most fatal in January, March, and June. It prevailed with less severity in the north of the district than in the south and east." * * * Bankura.-The cholera of this year was sudden in occurrence and of a virulent type. It visited principally the villages and towns situated along the road by which pilgrims travel, * * * which are favourite resting places for the weary and afflicted. * * * The disease was also rife among the poverty-stricken and in localities where the laws of sanitation are least observed. Rajshahi.-Commencing in January, the cholera of this year appeared to have acquired fresh intensity in February; rapidly increased in March; and attained its maximum in April. Gradually declining in May, it suddenly disappeared about the end of June, probably owing to the setting in of the monsoon. It re-appeared in November, and became most virulent in December. Rangpur.-In the beginning of the year cholera was raging in an epidemic form in the north-east of the district, in the country on the banks of the Dharla. This ou break subsided towards the end of February, and dis- appeared entirely towards the end of April. Subsequently sporadic cases occurred in different parts of the district. Malda.-Cholera prevailed in this district extensively, and most fatally; but with varied intensity throughout the year. * * * The disease first appeared in January in a sporadic form in the town and south-eastern parts of the district. * * * In March it prevailed everywhere, except in Nawab- ganj and Shibganj. From June the disease abated in intensity, and gradually died away. In December, however, it again appeared in some parts of the district, but in a milder form. Dhaka.-Cholera had not visited this district epidemically since 1869, but during this year a very general and severe epidemic occurred, equal in viru- lence to those that took place in 1864 and 1861. Since 1817 this scourge has been a visitant of this district, and it is believed that it breaks forth with special virulence every fourth year; that it is always to be met within those months when the diurnal variations of the temperature are
(   77   ) greatest, and when the south-west and north-east winds blow strongly; and that it appears in an exceptionally severe form after an early subsidence of inundation. During 1873 the rain floods at their highest were lower than they had been for years, and cholera appeared at an earlier date after the rains than usual. Bakirganj.-Cholera, which is endemic here, assumed an epidemic form in 1873, and visited most parts of the district, particularly during the hot-weather and during December and January, the two coldest months. Patna.-Epidemic cholera of a severe type appeared in several parts of this district in 1873. Except in the city of Patna, where the disease lingered longer than elsewhere, the time of prevalence was during the hot months, from March to September inclusive. * * * At Behar the disease broke out with great virulence immediately after the subsidence of the inundation of the town, which was caused by a heavy fall of rain, the severity of the attack being most marked in those parts of the city which lie at the lowest level, and were, therefore, most affected by the floods. Gya.-Cholera was present in this district during the greater part of the year, and to it in a secondary degree is due the high mortality. During the rains the disease was more or less epidemic throughout the district-no part of it escaped. In August it was at its highest. It was reported to have broken out simultaneously in different parts of the district, and in places remo- ved from the ordinary lines of traffic. Shahabad.-Cholera,  epidemic in   character,   prevailed during the year in every  sub-division in this  district.    It appeared in serious form in April; became diffused  in various  parts of the district in May; increased consider- ably in  incidence  towards the middle of June, particularly in the vicinity of Arrah;  and  attained its  maximum in July.    The  outbreak  lasted  up   to November,  and  the  mortality that attended it was  considerably in excess of that of the preceding year.  * * *  Notwithstanding  all the precautions that were  taken to exclude  the  disease from the jail  by enforcing strict attention to cleanliness,  isolation, careful  examination of food, allowing extra salt, and keeping prisoners under  surveillance, so as to send any to hospital the moment they appeared unwell,   cholera  entered  the prison  on the 25th  June,  and continued in it until the 5th July.    It attacked 56 prisoners, of whom 18 died. Every step was taken to stamp out the disease.    The  sick were isolated; their dejecta  and  excreta were   promptly removed  to  a distance from the jail; sulphur fires were burnt in the wards and in the jail hospital; and immediate attention  was  afforded  to  those  who  were  attacked.    Alarm caused many prisoners  to  conceal their illness,  thus  greatly  diminishing the  chances of recovery.    At last it was deemed expedient to remove the prisoners  from the jail; and  on the 4th July  they were taken to the large building north of the police lines and Buxar road.    This step put an end to the outbreak in a very striking manner,  as only  two prisoners  (the last of the cases) were attacked the next day, the 5th; and one of them was found on enquiry to have had the disease before he left the jail.    All the sanitary arrangements of the jail were in good order; there was no overcrowding worth  the name.    This  outbreak cannot, therefore, be assigned to any other cause than the very unhealthy and unseasonable  weather of June and  July.    As illustrative of the non-conta- gious  character of cholera, it may be mentioned that the four prisoners who were employed as  sick attendants, and had worked night and day throughout the   entere   outbreak,   were not  affected   by  the  disease;  and that  of  16 others, who were  similarly employed for short periods, only one was attacked. Two methods  of treatment of the sick were  adopted in the jail during this outbreak, with a striking difference in results.   The first 19 cases were treated with a mixture of sulphuric, acetic,  and carbolic  acids  repeated  every  half hour, or at longer intervals, according to the circumstances of each case.   The patients were allowed to drink  moderate  quantities of water acidulated with sulphuric acid, and they had then sago or arrowroot  with small  quantities of milk as nourishment  during  convalesence.    Mustard-plasters  to the  epigas- tric region, and dry friction to the limbs and chest were also employed in some cases.    In a few cases,   where the disease was only just  commencing, hyper- chlorodyne was tried,  but without good effect.    When the urgent symptoms were abating,  a mixture of nitre, nitric ether, and tincture of cautharides
(78) was given to promote the secretion of urine;* * * the rest 37 in number were treated in a different manner. "I became," writes Dr. Thornton, the Civil Surgeon," dissatisfied with the acid treatment on account of the heavy mortality (47 per cent.) which I found resulting from its use, and I resolved to try a method recommended by Dr. Billing, an eminent London physician, who practised it successfully in the cholera epidemic of 1831-32. This author considers cholera as an essentially febrile disease, and treats it by antimony and salines, followed by quinine." Tarter emetic grains ii Sulphate of magnesia  31/2 Water ...  3viii A table spoonful every half hour or according to circumstances. "I adopted this plan and treated all the other cases that occurred with the mixture noted in the margin, and with the quinine mixture when the urgent symptoms were abating. Out of 37 cases thus treated, there were 28 recoveries and nine deaths, a mortality of only 24 per cent. This result is rendered still more favourable by the facts that three of the patients who died were feeble, sickly old men, quite unable to rally, and that a fourth was brought to hospital in a hopeless state, in which no treatment could be of any avail. During the stay of the prisoners in camp, several men of the police guard, some mem- bers of their families, and a considerable number of people from neighbouring villages, were treated in this way for cholera in different stages, and nearly all of them recovered." Tirhut.-"Cholera prevailed in an epidemic form in this district during the months of March to September. These cases were a good deal scattered, and the outbreak was not very severe in any locality. The villages that fared the worst were those situated in the north-west, west, and south-west of the district." Saran.-"Cholera as an epidemic visited this district in June, July, August, and September. The lower classes, the poor, ill-fed, and intemperate are said to have been especially attacked." Champaran.-"Cholera was present in this district, but confined to limited localities, during eight months of the year, the months of immunity being January, March, April and December. From the latter end of July to the end of August it was very severe, almost epidemic in character, and caused a mortality that created great alarm." The Civil Surgeon says-"cases of sporadic cholera are of frequent occurrence owing to dietary indiscretions, especially during the marriage months, when the poor, who are living in a state of semi-starvation at other periods, gorge themselves with the most he- terogenous articles in the shape of food; purging and vomiting in a severe form results, and unless the person attacked is of a strong robust frame, his surrounding conditions are altogether against his recovery." Monghyr.-"Cholera was present in this district throughout the year. In the earlier months the cases were not numerous, but in April the disease assumed an almost epidemic form, and continued its ravages till October, exhibiting its worst features in May, June and July." Bhagalpur.-"Cholera, in some cases in epidemic form, broke out in this district in March, and ceased by the end of June." Purnia.-"Cholera broke out in this district in a severe form in March, prevailed with the greatest intensity in April, and disappeared in June. * * * About a fortnight after the Carogola fair, and while the Mohurrum festival was being observed, cholera of a severe, but not of a virulent character, broke out in the villages along the Ganges and Darjeeling road, to which part it was chiefly confined. Not a case occurred while the fair lasted, nor is there any evidence of importation. Women and children suffered more than men. The disease commenced abating about the end of April." A list of 12 villages which were affected is given, showing the prevalence of the disease in each; the total number of cases is 802 with 596 deaths. "A few cases of cholera also occurred in the native town to the north of the station, but the disease did not pervade the station or appear in the jail." Santhal.-"Several outbreaks of cholera occurred in this district during the year. They were in most cases of very brief duration, ceasing almost before the places could be visited. * * * These outbreaks were for the most part ascribed to heat and want of rain. The insanitary state of the affected
(79) localities, and the filthy habits of the people, formed also main features in inducing the disease." Cuttak.-"Cholera, as usual, visited the district in February, soon after the pilgrims flocked in for the first Puri festival, and again in March, in which month the Dol Jatra takes place. It continued its ravages up to August, after which it rapidly declined. The peculiarity of the disease is to confine itself to localities which are pilgrim routes and pilgrim resorts."* * * Puri.-"Cholera of a mild type, seldom ending fatally before three days, and attended with comparatively less mortality than in former years, broke out in this district in January, declined with the cessation" (sic) "of the rains, and finally disappeared by the end of July.* * * There were two distinct out- breaks of the disease. The first occurred in the second week of January, and was imported by pilgrims from the Nilgiri sub-division of Balasur.* * * By the end of March this outbreak was extinct throughout the district. The second outbreak occurred early in June among pilgrims on the Trunk Road, and in Puri, beginning at a lodging house for pilgrims, and spreading rapidly throughout the town, and in several parts of the district. This outbreak ceased by the end of July. The number of pilgrims this year was considerably larger than in many years past." Balasur.-Cholera visited various parts of the district during the year, and was attended with a large mortality. Hazaribagh.-No report of cholera received from this district; but the mortuary returns show a total of 328 deaths during the year, against 111 in 1872. Lohardagga.-Cholera was present during the year in 16 out of 23 registering areas of this district. It was of brief duration in every place except Ranchi, where it appeared early in June, and did not finally disappear until the beginning of September. Singbum.-Cholera was present in this district thoughout the year. It assumed an epidemic form in July and August in the eastern part of the district bordering on Midnapur, and advanced in a westerly direction towards Chaebasa and Saraikila. Manbhum.-Cholera prevailed in this district during the year, but not epidemically. The mortality was, however, considerably in excess of the preceding year, in fact thrice as great, the figures being 840 in 1873 against 289 in 1872. In June cholera of a virulent type broke out in the village of Gobindpur and in the bazar. In that month 43 were attacked and 23 died. * * * On the 6th July the disease disappeared in the town of Purulia, in the bazar, and continued almost throughout the month. It was confined to the lower or eastern portion of the town, which is also the poorest. It was observed that the people of this place drank the water of tanks which were almost dry instead of resorting to the beautiful lake to the north of the bazar. The mortality that resulted from this outbreak was very high. * * * The Civil Surgeon writes :-"This morning, in going my rounds, I was told that a native was lying a little way off the high road leading out to Rani- ganj. I went to the place, and saw a man in a state of collapse, and he assured me that he had been lying there all night exposed to the heavy fall-2 inches and 57 cents of rain. His clothes were still wet. His story was, that being seized with symptoms of cholera yesterday evening, he was turned out by his host. The latter singularly enough, has now cholera, and is by far in a worse condition than the man whom he turned out in such a heartless manner."* * * The incidence of the cholera of 1873 among the troops and jail popu- lations in this province is shown in the subjoined abstract statements. Among the European troops-total average strength 3,505-there were altogether 6 admissions and 2 deaths from cholera, giving a death-rate of 057 per mille of strength. Of the 5 stations occupied by the European troops, the 2 following recorded cholera in 1873 :- Fort Willaim Strength            859       Admissions 3 Deaths  1 Dinapore "                      728 " 3 " 1 The strength of the affected troops is 1,587, the percentage of admissions to strength 038, and of deaths to admissions 33. Of the 6 admissions, there were 1 in April, 3 in June, 1 in September and 1 in December.
(80) Among the families of the European soldiers the following cholera was recorded in 1873:- Women-total average strength 362-there was no cholera. Children- total average strength 659-there was 1 admission and 1 death from cholera, viz., at Dinapore-strength 161, in June. Among the native troops-total average strength 5,253-there were altogether 29 admissions and 16 deaths from cholera, giving a death-rate of 304 per mille of strength. Of the 11 stations occupied by native troops, the 6 following recorded cholera in 1873:- Fort William Strength 629 Admissions 3 Deaths 4 Alipore " 938  16  7 Dum-Dum  117  1  1 Barrackpore  819  1  1 Dacca  277  4  1 Dinapore  658  4  2  The strength of the affected troops is 3,438, the percentage of admissions to strength 0.84, and of deaths to admissions 55. Of the 29 admissions, there were 1 in January, 11 in March, 9 in April, 3 in May, 2 in June, 1 in July, 1 in August, and 1 in September. Among the jail population-total average strength 19,929-there were altogether 354 admissions and 144 deaths from cholera, giving a death- rate of 7.22 per mille of population. Of the 50 jails in the province, the 31 following recorded cholera in 1873:- Presidency Strength 970 Admissions 10 Deaths 5 Alipore  2,444  21  9 Baraset  232  1  0 Jessore  465  1  0 Krishnagarh  354  2  0 Murshidabad   292  1  1 Hugli   490  5  2 Bardwan  310  5  4 Purulia   197  5  3 Rajmehal  97  1  1 Maldah  58  1  0 Rungpur  402  1  0 Bogra   121  13  4 Bakirganj  598  19  6 Chittagong  245  1  0 Dacca  650  8  5 Midnapore   1,183  8  0 Cuttack  269  2  1 Puri   67  1  1 2 Bhagulpur, C. and D.  1,285  122  52 Julpaiguri  91  1  1 Chyebasa  75  8  6 Ranchi  240  5  1 Gya  493  8  1 Patna  421  11  9 Dehri Ght  650  9  2 Arrah  416  59  18 Champaran  217  13  8 Mozaffarpur  462  10  3 Chaprah   329  2  1  The strength of the affected jails is 14,123, the percentage of admissions to strength 251, and of deaths to admissions 41. Of the 354 admissions, there were 4 in January, 1 in February, 29 in March, 46 in April, 29 in May, 41 in June, 52 in July, 110 in August, 20 in September, 2 in October, 17 in Novem- ber and 3 in December. Meteorology-Atmospheric Pressure.-In January the pressure was generally low except in eastern Bengal, where the barometer was abnormally high throughout the year. In February and March the average pressure of the whole areas was as usual, but its distribution was irregular. In April there was a fall, but in May the pressure was everywhere in excess of the average. In June and July the pressure was abnormally low, except in Kachar. In August it rose above the average, and fell below it in
?(81) September in the Gangetic Valley and Bengal, and in the northern part of the Bay. In October and November there was a rise, which latterly became excessive, but in December was less than the average. Temperature of the air.-At the close of 1872, except in the central provinces and in Eastern Bengal, there existed an abnormally high rate of temperature, which in Orissa and Hazaribagh was maintained till the end of April. Everywhere else there was in January a general and unusual fall of temperature to 1 below the average After a rise in February the temper- ature declined below the average in March, and in April was of the usual intensity. In May the heat became excessive in Lower Bengal. At Calcutta 106 was registered on the 21st of the month, a temperature which has been reached but once before during the last 19 years. At Jessore on the same day the maximum was 1099, at Barhampur on the two succeeding days 1125, readings which, though common enough in the continental climate of the upper provinces, are extremely rare in the damper province of Bengal. In Chhota Nagpur at this time the temperature was below the average. In June, except at Goalpara and Silchar, owing to the comparative failure of the monsoon rains, the heat instead of moderating as in ordinary years, remained as intense as in May, and in some cases exceeded it. At Cuttack the excess was above the average by 3, and at Calcutta by 35'. In July the rain reduced the temperature to a very little above the average; and in Orissa to a little below it. In Patna, and probably at Gya, the temperature continued excessive to the end of the year. In Sep- tember the heat in Bengal was above the average; in October it was below it, save at Calcutta and Goalpara. In November, and still more in December, the weather was warmer than usual, except at Goalpara which was colder. Humidity.-Save in a few unimportant and exceptional cases, the quantity of vapour in the atmosphere was less than usual; and owing to this and the prevailing high temperature, its tendency to precipitation as rain was compar- atively small. In Hazaribagh, where the atmosphere was driest, the humidity was 11 per cent below the average of the year, and during the first six months of the year, and again in October ranged from 10 to 20 per cent. below the local average. At the close of 1872 everywhere in Bengal, except at Patna and Darjeeling, the air was moister than usual. In January, save at a few stations in the Gangetic delta, in Eastern Bengal, the air became generally drier. February was a still drier month. March and April, except at Hazaribagh, were moister than usual. In May the atmosphere in Northern Bengal and Bihar was excessively dry, the deficit at Patna, Monghyr, and Berhampore reaching to 10 and 14 per cent. of saturation. In June, save at False Point, the comparative dryness was ex- cessive and universal. In July and August the dryness was greater than usual, increased in September, especially in Behar, and in October became excessive. In November and December the excessive dryness somewhat abated, but less in the neighbourhood of the Himalayas than elsewhere. Rainfall.-The rainfall of 1873 was deficient almost everywhere, and uniformly so throughout the year, Hazaribagh and Ranchi being almost the only exceptions. In the deltaic districts of Lower Bengal the deficiency amounted generally to between 30 and 40 per cent. save in Western Burdwan, where it was but 20 per cent., and in one station, Suri, where there was a slight excess. In the Eastern districts south of the Khasi and Garo Hills (except at Noakhali, which had an excess of 17 per cent.) the rainfall was 20 per cent. below the average. In Assam the fall was from 12 to 30 per cent. below the average, and at Cherapunji 241 inches, or 46 per cent. Wind.-In January the northerly winds that had prevailed in the delta during the last two months of 1872 died away, the prevalent direction in Behar and Lower Bengal being west, but unsteady and variable. In February and March the winds were as usual westerly in the interior and southerly on the coast and in Orissa, except in Eastern Bengal, where easterly winds preponderated. In April the coast winds continued, as usual, steady from the south, but in Northern Bengal and Bihar there was still an excess of easterly winds, especially indicated at Monghyr and Berhampur. June was remarkable for an unusual prevalence of westerly winds, especially noticeable at Hazaribagh and Kattak, and at Silchar, at which place there was in this M
(82) and the preceding month an unusual preponderance of northerly over souther- ly winds. An excess of westerly winds continued throughout July. In August the winds became easterly, a change generally characteristic of Sep- tember, and an indication of the approaching close of the monsoon. In September the winds were less easterly in the Lower Provinces; to a less marked degree in the Eastern Provinces. In October, in Bengal Proper and Orissa northerly winds prevailed to an unusual degree, in Bihar the direction was from the west, and somewhat southerly. This tendency continued to the close of the year. The movement of the air in January was low; in March and April above the mean; in May much below it in the delta and to the eastward, and above it to the west and in the Ganges valley. This continued to a more or less extent in July and throughout the rains, the difference being especially marked in September. In November and December there was a brisker movement of the air, except at Chittagong, Silchar, and Berhampur. Food-supply.-The staple articles of food in the province, as a whole, were dearer than usual, but prices were not high. No direct connection between the food-supply-either as to quality or quantity-and any special prevalence of diseases has been reported.

(87) The general mortuary returns of the province, being considered unreliable, have not been published with the annual sanitary report. In their stead appear the statistics of the above selected areas, which are considered approximately correct, and therefore worthy of permanent record. The monthly cholera mortality registered in the selected areas during 1874 is shown in the annexed tabular statement. The total of deaths registered in the selected areas is 6,345, or at the rate of 2.36 per mille of population. Of the above deaths 3,418 or 2.67 per mille of population were returned from the urban, and 2,927 or 2.08 per mille, from the rural areas. Exclusive of these deaths in the selected areas, a total of 50,531, or 0.88 per mille, deaths from cholera were registered during the year in the remaining areas of the province. Of these 50,531 deaths 902 or 1.30 per mile were registered in the town, and 49,629 or 0.87 per mille in the rural circles of the general area. The total deaths registered from cholera during 1874 amounted to 56,876, or 0.94 per mille of population. The returns show " that the prevalence and fatality of cholera in 1874 were somewhat less severe than in the preceding year, and that the rural areas suffered in 1874 to a greater extent than the urban areas in both the selected tracts, and the general registering circles, but that in 1873 the reverse was the case in the selected tracts. * * * The cholera of the year under review was less severe, less wide-spread, and less extensively epidemic than that of the preceding year. It was present, however, in every district. The monthly prevalence and fatality of the disease varied greatly in different parts of the province. The peculiarities are illustrated by a series of diagram, which as Dr. J. M. Coates, Sani- tary Commissioner for Bengal, observes in Section III of his report for 1874, "show in a clearer manner than any array of figures the monthly prevalence and fatality of the disease, as it existed in the different circles or Commissionerships into which Bengal is divided, and in the urban and rural circles of the province." These diagrams are here reproduced as the most eloquent expositors of the recorded deportment of cholera in Bengal in 1874. Cholera in the Western Circle (Burdwan Dvision). Total mortality 1.62 per 1,000 of population.
(88) Cholera in the Central Circle (Presidency, Rajshahi and Kuch Bihar Divisions) in 1874. Total mortality 143 per 1,000 of population. Cholera in the Eastern Circle (Dhaka and Chittagong Divisions) in 1874. Total mortality 102 per 1,000 of population. Cholera in the Bihar Circle (Patna and Bhagalpur Divisions) in 1874. Total mortality 26 per 1,000 of population.
(89) Cholera in the Orissa Circle or Division in 1874. Total mortality 80 per 1,000 of population, Cholera in the Chota Nagpur Circle or Division in 1874. Total mortality 58 per 1,000 of population.

(90) The returns show "that on the whole, the districts were comparatively free from cholera during the earlier months of the year; that in some of the districts where it did prevail, it was a continuation of the disease which was developing in intensity at the end of the preceding year; that the disease prevailed with much severity in the hot months, for the most part from March to June, before the rains had properly set in; that it increased in intensity month by month, and was epidemic in the western and eastern circles, and very severe in the central; that it culminated in severity and fatality in May, and commenced abating from June; that a comparative lull took place in September; that the disease appeared again in the cold months of October, November and December, particularly in the eastern and central circles, and was very severe in November, but not to the same extent as in the hot season." The causes which originated, fostered, and propagated the cholera of this year, as gathered from the reports of the Civil Surgeons, appear to have been it is stated,-"bad, foul, and deficient water-supply; *** prolonged inundations or impeded drainage retaining moisture and damp in the ground and emitting noxious effluvia; malarious or vitiated air in the vicinity of low-lying marshes, or pits, hollows, &c., containing exposed and putrescent vegetable and animal matter; insanitary conditions of special localities; deficient ventilation; errors of diet, such as the use of new rice, decayed and putrid fish, raw fruit and vegetables, or decomposed food; congregation of large bodies of people at the famine relief centres, on pilgrim routes, or in pilgrim resorts and fairs during months of excessive heat. There were instances also in which the introduc- tion or dissemination of the disease was ascribed to importation or contagion." "It was observed that wherever, rapid communication and a comfortable mode of conveyance occur along a pilgrim road, as at Gya and Parasnath, cholera decreased and did not spread to the people generally. *** The fatigue and exposure, the bad or improperly cooked food, the dirty water, and the filthy resting places, directly caused bowel congestions and cholera attacks among the Puri pilgrims. Another most potent cause of cholera among the Puri pilgrims has recently been discovered." It was the foul water "which the duped pilgrims are made to drink copiously" from a cistern which received the washings from the paved floor of the inner temple of Jaganath. The floor is washed after each offering of food to the idol, and the washings carry down the filth of all human feet treading inside the temple, with small quantities of boiled rice and other articles prepared with ghi, molasses, &c., spilt on the floor in being carried to and from the front of the images. These washings run into a cistern which on examination was found full of water, and in sounding the depth with a bamboo probe "the water was disturbed, sending forth noxious exhalations, the breathing of which is highly deleterious. *** This collection of the washing is continued from month to month, and from year to year. In clearing it a cart-load of filth was found silted at the bottom." A sample of the water was submitted to the Chemical Examiner, who reported- "No analysis performed so far away from the source of the water can be satis- factory. The present specimen is so foul and putrid as to resemble sewage rather than drinking water. It contains sulphuretted hydrogen sufficient to blacken lead paper immediately it is exposed to it, and requires 34 parts of oxygen per million to purify it." The incidence of the cholera of 1874 among the troops and jail populations is shown in the subjoined abstract statements.

Cholera in Bengal Province during the year 1875. Lithographed at the Survey of India Offices, Calcutta, January 1885.
?(95) BENGAL PROVINCE, 1875. During the year 1875 the population of the selected areas differed in num- ber, owing to classification and arrangement, from that of 1874; but as these changes were made only in a few circles they have not affected the total popu- lation of the general circles; "and with regard to the selected circles they do not, on the whole, disturb the general results to any material extent." The monthly mortality registered from cholera in the selected areas is shown in the annexed tabular statement for 1875. The total of the deaths registered is 7,704, or at the rate of 5.76 per mille of the population of the selected areas to which these returns refer. The total population in which these deaths were registered is given at 2,688,076, viz., males 1,378,165 and females 1,309,911. In the urban circles-population, males 673,976 and females 609,987, total 1,283,963-there were registered 4,365 deaths, viz. males 2,956 and females 1,769, the ratios per mille of population being respectively 3.39 and 3 85 and 2.90. In the rural circles-population, males 704,189 and females 699,924, total 1,404,113--the deaths were 3,339, viz. males 1,806 and females 1,533, the ratio per mille of population being respectively 2.37 and 2.19. Inclusive of the deaths registered in the selected areas, the total number of deaths from cholera registered in 1875 was 108,262, or 1.80 per mille of the population, against 56,876, or 94 per mille, in 1874, and 58,675, or .98 per mille, in 1873. Of the deaths in 1875, there were returned from the towns 5,474, or 2.77 per mille, and from the rural general circles 102,788, or 1.77 per mille. The results in the selected areas as compared with those of 1874 are as follows:- For the town circles, 3,365 deaths in 1875 against 3,418 deaths in 1874. For the rural      "     3,339         "          "        "         2,927         "        " The combined   "     7,704         "          "        "         6,345         "        " Ratio per mille of population 3.39 for towns in 1875, against 2.67 in 1874. "          "           "         "           2.37 rural circles       "        "      2.08       " "          "          ,,         ,,          2.86 combined          "        "      2.36       " The most noticeable feature in the history of the cholera of 1875 in the Bengal province is its wide prevalence. No single district in the province escaped altogether, and in those which suffered most this cause of death may be said to have been in operation all the year round. The figures above given, taken in connection with the reports of district medical officers, indicate that cholera prevailed with great severity in Bengal during the year 1875, more than one-fifth of the deaths being attributed to it, and that the death-rate from this cause, making due allowance for improvement in registration of deaths in the general circles, was greatly in excess of that of the preceding year. The death returns show that that there are two distinct periods of the year, as has been frequently noticed in previous reports, in which cholera prevails with great intensity in Bengal, viz. in the hot season from March to July, and in the two last months of the year. The degree of prevalence of cholera and the number of circles affected in each month of 1875 are shown as follows :-     MONTHS. Number of deaths. Number of circles affected. MONTHS. Number of deaths. Number of circles affected. January 4,993 211 July 6,140 322 February 5,580 236 August 4,297 263 March 11,191 365 September 2,623 242 April 12,395 367 October 5,425 274 May 10,695 325 November 18,363 426 June 7,998 360 December 18,562 442
(96) In January the disease was present in 211 circles of 34 districts. From February it gradually spread over the districts, increasing also the intensity, until April, when 367 circles in all the 44 districts were suffering. In May the disease began to decline and continued to do so month by month till the minimum prevalence of the year was reached in September. In October there was again an increased prevalence of cholera, the mortality being more than double that of the preceding month, and about equalling that of February. In November this increase considerably more than trebled itself, and con- tinued at this high degree of intensity during December, in correspondence with the rise in March and April, though at a greatly increased rate of prevalence and mortality, the disease being present in all the districts in November and December. The monthly rise and fall of cholera mortality in 1875 is shown in the subjoined diagram:- Cholera Mortality in the Bengal Province in 1875. Total mortality 1.80 per 1,000 of population. The district that suffered most from cholera in 1875 was Nuddea. The disease prevailed throughout the year in all of its 33 registering circles, "and as usual, was specially fatal in what may be called the drying months, February, March, and April, and again in November and December.* * * The mortality from this cause in the entire district and for the whole year was 548 per 1,000 of population, and 999 out of the 3,691 villages were attacked. Jaisur.-In this district also cholera prevailed throughout the whole year and in 1,352 out of 4,247 villages. Here also the same periods of endemic intensity occurred. March and November, with similar intervals of subsidence-July to September. The malady was not confined to any locality, but the cases were scattered over the whole district. 24-Parganahs.-Similar remarks apply to this district, but the disease increased and declined with less suddenness, and the number of cases were spread more evenly over each month, though there was a decided lull in July August, and September. The reported number of deaths from cholera amounted to 7,109, and 1,330 villages out of 4,991 in the district were affected.
(97) Dhaka.-This district also " suffered severely from cholera, the disease having been reported from 1,275 out of its 5,016 villages. There was a more even distribution of the disease over the months from January to June, and a sudden fall from the end of September to the middle of November.* * * At the two large fairs held in the district there was a comparative absence of the disease. Jailpaiguri.-Here the disease prevailed from April to December, and unlike the foregoing districts, manifested greatest intensity in June and October. From April to the close of the year the disease was more evenly spread over those months, and there was an almost total absence of it in the first quarters of the year. In the latter end of April virulent outbreaks of the disease occurred simultaneously at Boda and Alipur, which are situated at opposite extremes of the district, the former on the Dinagepur frontier, and the latter on the skirts of the Terai, about 20 miles south of the cantonment of Buxa. * * * Another outbreak occurred at the railway works at Man- dalghat, three miles south of the sadr station. * * * Of the 250 villages 90 were visited by cholera.'' The police returns greatly under-state the mortal- ity that occurred. The districts of Chittagaon, Noakhali, Tipperah, Faridpur, and Bakirganj all suffered severely from cholera, and the seasonal incidence of the disease corresponds with that of the districts of the Dhaka division. The following statement gives at a glance the wide prevalence and fatality of cholera in the abovementioned districts:-           DISTRICTS. Number of deaths. Ratio per 1,000 of population  Number of circles attacked. Number of villages attacked. Number of villages in the district. Chittagaon   875  .77 10 174 1,088 Noakhali 2,204 3.08  8 364 2,034 Tipperah  2,222 1.44 14 577 6,150 Bakirganj 3,022 1.60 15 458 3,244 Faridpur 3,303 2.17 13 973 3,332  Kattak.-Deaths from cholera were reported from this district in every month of the year, but it was much more general and fatal from March to December; June, July, November and December being the months of greatest fatality. The disease was reported in 10 out of 12 circles. Compared with the returns for 1873 and 1874, cholera was unusually prevalent in 1875 after the month of September. " Through this district passes the chief pilgrim route from Northern and North-Western India, and several minor routes join the main road from the west. There is also a constant stream of pas- sengers from the new port of Chandbally through Kendrapara to Kattak. The total cholera deaths reported during the year is 4,102. Puri.-There are special circumstances connected with this district and its chief town of the same name, which enhance the value of all observations bearing on the origin, progress, locality and seasonal activity of cholera. The town of Puri, containing the temple of Jaganath, is the goal to which constant streams of pilgrims converge from Northern, Western, and Southern India. It is periodically thronged to overcrowding by poor and wearied travellers, and this overcrowding occurs at the most unhospitable season of the year. Cholera is a yearly visitor in the district, and its occurrence is invariably attributed to importation by pilgrims. * * * In all the months, except January, cholera was present in the district, but unlike the districts of the Presidency and Dhaka Divisions, the period of endemic intensity occurred in July, August, and December, instead of March or April, and November. The circles in this district in which cholera prevailed most were Puri, which returned 4.81 deaths per 1,000 of population, Pipli 2.16, and Khudra 1.94. It is through these circles that the chief pilgrim routes pass. The Banpur and Tanghy circles, through which a small number of pilgrims from the south travel, returned a death-rate of 1.82 and 2.60 respectively, the Gop circle, to the eastward of the district, through which no pilgrims pass, gives a death-rate from cholera of .41 per 1,000 of population. In this last circle, however, regis- tration, it is stated, is least advanced, for the deaths from all causes are little O
(98) more than half those returned from the other circles. The total of cholera deaths registered in this district is 1,906. Balasur.-Cholera prevailed all over the district, and throughout the year. The time of the endemic intensity of the disease was March and November, yet it was generally severe from February to July inclusive, and during the whole of the last three months of the year. The chief route for pilgrims from Northern and North-Western India passes through the whole length of the district. The total cholera deaths of the year is given at 2,776. The highest rate per 1,000 occurred in the Baliapal circle, which has no pilgrim route pass- ing through it. The death-rates of the circles most severely affected were as follows:-Baliapal 12.76, Chandbali 4.54, Dhamnagar 3.84, Jaleswar 3.21, and the town of Balasur itself 7.93 per 1,000. Midnapur.-Cholera present in this district all the year round, but in severe form in the first four months only. February and March were the most fatal months. From May to November inclusive, the disease did not occur with severity; there was a slight increase in June and again in November and December. The disease was reported from 25 of the 26 circles of the district. The severest mortality occured in the circles : Kontai at the rate of 16.58 per 1,000 of population, Nandigram 5.91, Bhagwanpur 4.69, Kedgree 3.63. Though this distict is traversed by the great stream of pilgrims to Puri from north and north-west, the circles which suffered most from cholera, lying as they do to the eastward of the district, are not traversed by pilgrims in any number. All the districts of the Rajshahi and Kuch Bihar Divisions suffered from cholera in 1875, but in different degrees of severity, as is shown in the follow- ing statement:-    DISTRICTS. Deaths. Ratio per 1,000 of population. NUMBER OF VILLAGES.    In district.  Attacked. Dinagepur 1,268  .84 7,108 ? Malda 1,712 2.53 2,100    382 Rajshahi 1,247  .95 4,228    176 Rangpur 5,664 2.63 4,206  1,225 Bogra 1,888 2.73 2,666    512 Pabna 2,153 1.77 2,792  1,661 Darjiling   150 1.58 ...     ... Jalpaiguri 1,353 ...   250     90  Except in Darjiling and Jalpaiguri, which has already been referred to, cholera was present all the year in the above districts. The seasonal activity of cholera in these districts is somewhat different from that of the more southern districts of the province, for the disease did not, as a rule, reach its maximum intensity till April, and in the case of Rangpur, May ; but Novem- ber was the most fatal month. In Darjiling district some of the Terai tea- plantations suffered severely from cholera. In the districts of Bhagalpur Division the seasonal prevalence of cholera differs from that of the districts already considered, and seems to observe a less constant rule in regard to its increase and decline, at the same time the periods of prevalence are more decidedly marked, and the intervals more defined, whilst, further, the disease appears to be less general over the whole area of the districts. Thus in Monghyr no death from cholera was registered in January, in February only 1, in March 28, and in April 79; in May the deaths rose to 424, and in June to 788 ; from June till September there was a decline in the number of deaths; in October a slight increase, and then again a steady decline till the end of the year; there were but 32 deaths in December. The disease was present in every circle of the district. In Bhagalpur there was but one death registered in each of the first three months of the year; 224 in the next three months, and in the rainy season, from July to October inclusive, 1,406; in November 1882, and in December only 3 deaths were registered. The whole of the 13 circles of the district were affected, but in 3 of them the disease prevailed slightly. In Purnea, which borders on the Rajshahi division, the seasonal prevalence of cholera resembles that of the districts of Rajshahi,
(99) the greatest mortality being in March, April and May, then a gradual decline till November, and an almost free interval from December onwards. The total deaths registered were 2,480, and 299 villages out of 4,179 were affected. In Santhal district the seasonal prevalence of cholera is very similar to that observed in Bhagalpur and Monghyr; from May to October was the season of greatest mortality; from November to April there were a few sporadic cases in the district. The total mortality registered is 1,005; only 198 villages out of 9,634 were affected. The districts of Patna division were more severely visited by cholera in 1875 than in 1874, and Gya suffered most. In the Patna district the disease prevailed throughout the year, but in sporadic form the first two months. In March there was an increase till June, when the greatest mortality of the year was reached, after which the majority of the deaths occurred in the city of Patna and the adjoining unions of Dinapur. The total deaths registered were 2,062, and 624 villages out of 5,242 were affected. In Gya district the disease existed throughout the year, except in February; it was most severe in the Aurangabad sub-division to the south, and a part of the Jahanabad sub-division, to the north, was entirely free from it; many villages on the banks of the Sone were affected. The total deaths were 3,505, and 303 out of 6,530 villages were affected. In the Shahabad district cholera was present in every month, except January and December, and affected all the 15 circles; June was the most fatal month, as in Patna and Gya. The total deaths were 1,346, and out of 5,110 villages 247 were affected. In East and West Tirhut (Muzaffarpur and Darbhanga) registration was still defective, and "affords very little aid in tracing the commencement and progress of this or other diseases." Cholera appeared in Darbhanga at a festival held at Bazitpur in March, and in April deaths from the disease were reported from every circle in the district; the circles which suffered most severely were Madhobani at the northern extremity of the district, and Bazitpur on its southern boundary. In Champaran cholera was prevalent from May to October inclusive; only one death was reported in April, and none in the other months. Total deaths 521, and villages affected 60 out of 2,299 in the district. In Saran, considering the density of the population and the general prevalence of cholera in Bengal, the district did not suffer much in 1875. A total of 832 deaths, or 40 per 1,000 of population, was reported, and 241 out of 4,350 villages were affected. Each of the four districts of the Chhota Nagpur division reported cholera during the year. In Hazaribagh and Lohardagga the season of prevalence corresponded with that in the Patna group of districts, the greatest mortality occurring in June and July with an almost total absence of the disease in the cold months. In Singhbhum and Manbhum, on the other hand, although cholera did not prevail with severity, there was a more even distribution of the disease over the whole year. In Manbhum the greatest mortality was reached in March and April; in Singhbum in June and July, with a decided increase again in November and December. In the districts of Bardwan, Bankura, Birbhum, Serampur and Howrah none of which, with the exception of Howrah, suffered severely, there is more variation in the seasons of greatest prevalence, though in all of them cholera manifests the tendency to increase at two periods in the year. Howrah returned a death rate of 2.58 per 1,000 of its population, and more than one-fourth of the total deaths occurred in the municipality of Howrah. In the suburbs of Calcutta, in a little more than one quarter of a million of inhabitants, 2,099 deaths from cholera were reported in 1875. The disease was not confined to one locality more than another, and was present in a marked degree in every month. March, April, and December were the months of greatest intensity. Regarding the Port of Calcutta, reference is made to some valuable notes on cholera, recorded by Dr. French, the result of his observations and inquiries during the last four months of the year, for which period he held the appointment of Health Officer of the port. There appears to be no peculiar locality in the port affected more than another. * * * There were altogether 34 cases of cholera on 20 ships * * * No case occured in vessels between their arrival at the mouth of the river and their morrings in port. "Nearly all the cases occured after the vessels o 2
(100) had been for some time in port.* * * Of the 34 cases, one was a Captain's wife, 7 were officers, 9 petty-officers, and only 17 were seamen. * * * Twelve of the 34 cases were living on board their ship in the Union Dock, 7 of the remain- der had never landed. Three or 4 of the cases occurred shortly after the men returned to their ship, but in each the man had been drinking. Of the 12 cases which occurred on the ship in the Union Dock, a detailed account is given. The main facts are as follows:-The ship Margeurite arrived in port on the 16th September with a crew of 16 men, who had all been well on the voyage. On the 1st October she went into the Union Dock for repair, and shortly after increased her crew to 24 by taking eight men from the discharged crew of a vessel lying near her in the dock. The Marguerite was stripped of everything in her hold, and about 300 men were daily employed upon her. The crew remained in the ship, had their meals on board, and used their sup- ply of Bourbon water. Up to the 5th November no case of cholera had occurred among any of the workmen or officials in the dock. From the 5th to the 14th November inclusive, there were 12 cases among the crew of 24 men, and seven of them proved fatal. About 60 men of the yard slept on the premises and on the ships, of which there were two others besides the Marguerite in the dock, and about 700 men were employed in the workshops daily. The crew of the Marguerite mixed freely with the workmen, but they slept apart; had their food onboard ; and used their own water-supply. The condition of the dock was clean, and the ship was empty and free from disagreeable odours. The house for the crew was on deck, and in a fairly satisfactory state-such are the facts recorded. Then comes a story of the Captain's: that the men slept in the open air under a tree near the river bank; that they went freely into the bazar and bought what they liked ; that they had got hold of a cask of condemned salt-meat and had eaten freely of it, shortly after which sickness broke out among them. The men, it appears, were not stinted in fresh-meat and vegetables, nor in their dram of brandy three times a day. Their water- supply, however, was changed. On the 27th October the ship's water-supply was purchased from boatmen, who pretended to supply the Calcutta filtered water to all ships in the harbour not near enough to take a direct supply from the hydrants on the banks, and was used by the crew of the Marguerite from the 28th July. This water had a foul odour, as of sulphurreted hydro- gen, and a very unpleasant taste, both of which were attributed to the wood of the casks. An analysis of this water showed that it was most impure and quite unfit for drinking ; and on the 14th the water was thrown away, and the remainder of the crew, now reduced to 12, were removed to the Sailors Home. No case of cholera occurred after this. The incidence of the cholera of 1875 among the troops and jail popu- lations in this province is shown in the subjoined abstract statement. Among the European troops-total average strength 3,017-there was no cholera recorded in 1875. Among the families of the European soldiers. Women-total average strength 620-there was 1 admission and 1 death from cholera, viz. at Dina- pur-strength 191-in May. Among the native troops-total average strength 5,419-there were altogether 16 admissions and 7 deaths from cholera, giving a death-rate of 1.29 per mille of strength.

Meteorology. Rainfall.-North and east of the Ganges in Bengal (excluding Malda and the Chittagong Division) the total rainfall for the year was somewhat less than the average quantity. The defect, however, was only considerable in the northern districts. At Dinagepur, where it was greatest, it amounted to 45 per cent, of the average fall. In the Chittagong Division, as in the neighbouring Assam districts of Sylhet and Kachar, the rainfall was very heavy. In Malda it was somewhat greater than the usual quantity. South and west of the Granges the total rainfall was on the whole about the average quantity, although slightly deficient in parts of Bardwan, and in the Midnapur Hugli and Howrah districts. The distribution of rainfall in Bihar was somewhat irregular. Above the average quantity was recorded in Champaran, in Patna, in the Tirhut sub-divisions of Hajipur and Tajpur, in parts of Shahabad and in Monghyr. Elsewhere in Bihar the total rainfall was somewhat deficient. At Sitamarhi, were the deficit was greatest, it amounted, as recorded, to 42 per cent, of the average fall. Two regions may be traced where the rainfall of the year has been much more deficient than elsewhere. The principal one lies north of the Ganges, in Bengal and Bihar, extending from Assam on the east as far as the Saran and Champaran districts on the west. This area includes the districts of Kuch-Bihar, Jalpaiguri, Dinagepur, Parnia, and parts of Bhagalpur, Dharbhanga and Muzaffarpur. Over this tract of
(102) country the deficit of rainfall was generally greater near the Himalayas than further south. The second area of scanty precipitation lies south of the Ganges, extending from the Rajmahal Hills on the east into the Shahabad district on the west. It includes the greater portion of South Bihar and the northern parts of the Province of Chota Nagpur. The deficency of rainfall was not so large in this second region as in the tract above mentioned. In the remainder of the province of Chota Nagpore the rainfall of the year was above average. This was likewise the case in the northern portion of Orissa. In the northern districts of Orissa the total rainfall of the year was ususually large. Food-supply.-With very few exceptions the average price of the three principal food-grains-wheat, rice, and pulses-was much lower in 1875 than in 1874. On the whole the yield of the year was plentiful, and there was no distress for want of food.

?( 106 ) BENGAL PROVINCE, 1876. During the year 1876 several changes were made, which affected the number, population, areas, and statistics of the general and selected circles of the province. During the year 1876 cholera was present in the province during every month, and prevailed with more or less intensity in every district. Out of the 666 circles into which the province is divided, the disease was epidemic in 154, very severe in 178, mildly prevalent in 315, and entirely absent from only 19; and 27,242 villages of the 188,805 villages in the province were attacked by the disease. The monthly mortality registered from cholera in the selected areas is shown in the annexed tabular statement for 1876. The total of cholera deaths registered is 23,055, or at the rate of 335 per mille of the population to which the figures refer. Of these deaths, 11,066, or 552 per mille of population were returned from the Urban circles, and 11,989, or 245 per mille from rural circles. Inclusive of these deaths, the total mortality registered from cholera in 1876 in the entire province amounts to 196,590, or 327 per mille of population, and 1999 per cent, of the total mortality of the year against 108,262, or 180 per mille of population in 1875; the excess being 88,328, or 147 per mille. The figures are considerably highest of any year since the introduction of registration in 1869, and show a very great increase in the mortality registered from cholera in 1876 as compared with the returns for the preceding year. Part of this excess is due to improved registration, but most of it is attributable to an actual increase in the activity of cholera in 1876 over that of 1875, especially in the cyclone-stricken areas. The districts in which the highest mortality was registered, as compared with the preceding year, are shown in the subjoined statement. Statement giving the Rates of Death per Mille of Population.

(108) Cholera in Behar in 1876. Cholera in Orissa in 1876.
(109) Cholera in Bengal Proper in 1876. The high mortality reached in November and December this year is not usual in Bengal, and is attributed to the effects of the cyclone in the Eastern Bengal. These diagrams show that in Bengal and Orissa, consisting of flat low-lying, muddy plains, the former intersected by the lower course of the Ganges and Brahmaputra, and the latter by the Maha- naddi-there are two periods in which cholera prevails with great severity, viz., from March to May in Bengal and March to July in Orissa, during which it attains maximum intensity; and again from October to December in both Bengal and Orissa, when it prevails with diminished severity, and that the remaining months are months of subsidence after each period of its seasonal activity. That in Bihar and Chota Nagpur, both of which are comparatively high and dry, there is only one period of intense prevalence of cholera; viz., from March to July in Bihar and March to August in Chota Nagpur; and that during the remaining months the prevalence of the disease is com- paratively mild. That, as a general rule, the disease prevails least when the rainfall is heaviest, and has submerged or is moving on through the country, particularly in Bengal. "Whether cholera has a special poison of its own, has not yet been demonstrated. If there be one, it is not communicable ordinarily from the living subject, first, because inoculation with fresh cholera secretions or excretions does not induce it; second, because those who rub cholera patients' skins, wash their clothes, scrape up, clean, carry, and bury their excreta, or dissect, carry, and bury the cholera corpses, do not get it; and lastly, cholera-collapsed mothers do not com- municate the disease to their sucking infants; though the latter pull at their breasts, lie on their sweat-covered arms, and on their soiled clothes and bedding. That cholera evacuations, whether in clothes, soil, water, food, &c., do become virulent, and do, especially when taken into the system by the mouth, give rise to cholera, I have no manner of doubt; but I am equally satisfied that cholera constantly arises de novo, and that in both cases the disease is intimately connected with the changes that occur in decaying organic matters. The most ready entrance of the disease into the system is by water impregnated with decaying organic matters. This water soon loses this power when the decaying changes are completed, and re-acquires it when fresh decaying matters find their way into it. I do not know of any of the phenomena associated with the origin and spread, the seasonal and local prevalence of, and the persons affected with the disease, with which the
( 110 ) above conditions are not   connected    (paragraph  51,   Doctor J. M. Coates' Report of Sanitary Commissioner for Bengal for 1876).

Bardwan.-The cholera mortality registered in 1876 was more than double the average of that of the three preceding years. It was present thoughout the year, and prevailed with greater severity from March to June, and again, but with less intensity in November and December. April and May were the worst months. The disease was continued into 1876 from an outbreak in the Katwah sub-division in November 1875, and spread through the district as the dry season advanced, but disappeared almost entirely as soon as the rains set in. On the 10th October a considerable inundation took place from the Damudah, such as had not been known for 10 or 12 years. A great portion of the country, * * *continued flooded for nearly three months. There had been heavy rain for two or three days. This was followed by a period of great freedom from cholera, and no doubt diminished the virulence of the winter outbreak. Bankura.-Cholera in its severe form commenced in March and abated in June. July to December, particularly August and September, were months of marked exemption. The disease first appeared in the town of Bankurah on the 1st March, during which month and the half of April, it prevailed with unusual severity, and caused the heavy mortality of 7.74 per 1,000 of its popu- lation. Numbers went away from the town, business was particularly at a stand-still, and the courts were closed for some days. It then spread to circles on the north and the south. Birbhum.-Here also cholera was severely epidemic from March to June, and less so in November and December. In April cholera was found to be prevailing generally throughout the district, and again in November, when all the circles in the district were affected, except that of Rajnagar. Midnapur.-The cholera which prevailed in this district in November and December 1875 continued to extend up to July 1876. After this month its virulence abated markedly until November, when it broke out afresh, but in less severe form. February and April were months of severe suffering. Hugli.-Cholera first appeared in Balagarh circle in February, and spread gradually. In March the disease prevailed severely in all the other circles and in the municipality. In May its activity abated. It was present again in November and December, but in sporadic form. Howrah.-On the whole the cholera of 1876 in this district was some- what less fatal than in 1875. The disease prevailed more severely during the changes of the season from hot to cold and from cold to hot than at other times, and diminished in intensity when the rains set in. In character it was tran- sient and erratic, visiting a village, disappearing from it, and going to another,
(111) before medical aid could reach it. Dr. Bird, the Civil Surgeon, remarks:-"It is noteworthy that the disease has during the past hot months proved most deadly in Howrah, where sanitary improvements are being speedily pushed on." 24.Parganahs.-The cholera, which visited this district with epidemic intensity in the winter of the preceding year, continued to prevail with varying degrees of severity up to May of 1876, and resumed its winter character in November and December leaving the months of June to October markedly free from the disease. January, April, and December were the worst months; but in the greatest portion of the district the disease prevailed with less in- tensity and fatality than in the preceding year. In the Basirhat, Baduria, Harwah, and Hasanabad circles, the disease prevailed with marked sever- ity. It is said that when the cold-weather commences, and the wind changes to a northerly direction, very dry and chilly at night, cholera appears here. At this time the poorer classes tap their date-trees, and make use of the juice with newly reaped rice and half-boiled goor. This, it is said, causes bowel irritations and predisposes the sufferers to cholera. * * * Naddia.-This district is, as a rule, affected with two distinct epidemic outbreaks of cholera; the first beginning in March, especially after the storms, when the days are hot and nights chilly, and lasting with more or lese intensity till the rains have fairly set in, when it disappears; the second beginning with the dry north winds and chilly foggy nights of October and November, and continuing to prevail with more or less severity till the end of December. If the cold-weather is mild, and evaporation is slow, the disease extends in the January following, and to this rule 1876 was no exception, although cholera prevails much less severely and fatally than in 1875; for the cold-weather of 1875-76 being particularly mild, and of short duration, the winter epidemic of 1875 continued to prevail during the first half of January 1876 in 17 out of the 31 circles of the district; the summer epidemic commenced in the first week of March, was at its height in April, began to subside in May, and was very low in June; the winter epidemic of 1876 commenced in the third week of October, reached its height in the second week of December, and then rapidy declined to the close of the year. Jaisur.-This district suffered very severely from cholera, the sub-divisions of Magura, Bagirhat, and Khulna mostly so. Bagirhat, in the south-east close to the Sundarbands, had been submerged by the cyclone inundation of the 31st October, and the bodies of many human beings and cattle which had been drowned were left by the receding waves in the rivers, tanks, fields, and ditches, and generally polluted the water. In Khulna in the south-east and Magura in the north-east a very fatal diarrhoea also prevailed; in the latter the disease was attended with vomiting and long round worms were voided in the purging. The disease was attributed to the use of raw fruits and vegetables and decomposed fish infested with worms. Murshidabad.-Cholera passed on into 1876 in this district from the epidemic which prevailed in December 1875, and prevailed with greater severity than in the preceding year. From January the disease commenced to decline, but in March it broke out with epidemic intensity, and in this month and April was severest in character. From May it declined till September, when it again began to increase, and prevailed epidemically from October to Decem- ber with almost equal severity as the March outbreak. The disease followed no regular course, but broke out almost simultaneously in most of the circles. Dinagepur.-Cholera was present throughout the year, though it prevailed with somewhat less severity than in the preceding year. April, May, and December were the months of greatest prevalence; in the remaining months the disease was in sporadic form. It was present in several places far distant from one another at one and the same time. Malda.-The cholera of November and December 1875 in this district continued to prevail through January and February, gradually extending; in March it covered a wider area, and in April, May, and June became quite general, no circle being free from its presence. From July to October there was a great lull, but in the latter part of October the disease revived and prevailed throughout November and December; it was nowhere epidemic, nor confined to one locality. The Medical Officer is of opinion that although
?(112) sanitary improvements are essential to prevent the outbreak and spread of epidemic diseases, they do not hold good always with cholera, and says that he has observed "that places well sanitated frequently suffer from cholera, at times vehemently." He instances the case of English Bazar and Makhdumpur, two principal quarters in the English Bazar Municipality. The former, which was more crowded, ill-ventilated, and untidy than the latter, was free from cholera while there were several cases in the latter. Rajshahye.-In January cholera was spread pretty evenly over the whole district; in February there was the usual characteristic lull; from March to May it prevailed with epidemic intensity; June to September were com- paratively free from the disease; and in October it broke out afresh and continued to prevail up to the end of the year. The severity of the disease was greater in 1876 than in the preceding year. The summer epidemic raged severely in most of the northern circles lying on the banks of the Ganges, and advanced in the face of the westerly and south-westerly winds. In the Charghat and Lalpur circles hardly a village escaped. The disease reached its climax between the 14th and 16th April, and when it commenced abating after May it did so rapidly. The Civil Surgeon says:- "It was surprising to find that this outbreak, so sudden and of so vigorous a character, should have subsided so quickly, and without spreading itself over a larger tract of country. Indeed its localization to a small tract of land lying on the north bank of the Ganges, and forming a portion of the southern parts of our district, was remarkable and can only be explained on the supposition that the atmospheric condition, which gives vitality to the cholera germs, was suddenly changed either chemically or otherwise, and the progress of the disease thereby cut short by the frequent falls of rain that occurred two or three weeks after the onset of the epidemic, the excessive temperature being thereby diminished, as also the great diurnal range. (Dr. Busby). The winter epidemic was not so severe as the summer ones, and was confined chiefly to the Nathor and Baragora circles. Rungpur.-The cholera of 1876 in this district was a continuation of the terrible epidemic which devastated many villages in 1875. The disease subsided considerably in February; began to be active in March; continued until the end of September; was almost absent in October; broke out afresh in November; and increased again in December. It was most fatal in July and August. Cholera here prevailed with less intensity in 1876 than in 1875. The disease is endemic in this district. It is stated that in those portions of the district which are dry and well drained cholera generaly prevails after accidental introduction, but that it loves to dwell, and has its seasonal activity in the damp and low portions of the country. Bogra.-The cholera of January 1876 in this district was a termination of the violent outbreak of the preceding year. It prevailed in a mild form till the 1st May, and then disappeared. In November it broke out again, and was most severe in December. On the whole the disease was much less severe and fatal than in the preceding year. The only circle which suffered very severely was that of Shariakandi, where the disease broke out in March 1875 and continued until April 1876, and again in November, lasting till the close of the year. Here 192 persons were attacked, and the death-rate per 1,000 was 113. Pabna.-Here also the cholera of the earlier months was a continuation of that which prevailed in the latter part of 1875; the disease existed through- out the district, all its 10 circles being affected, and was more fatal than in the preceding year. It was severe in January; declined in February; in- creased in March; and attained its maximum intensity in April: in July it declined again sensibly, and continued very low till October, that month and September being months of considerable immunity. In November the disease resumed its virulent character and continued to rage with violence up to the close of the year Darjiling.-Excluding the cyclone-affected areas, Darjiling suffered from cholera in 1876 in a far greater degree than any of the other districts of the province. The disease it appears has never been absent from the Terai of late years, although it has largely escaped notice, except when epidemic. The cholera of 1876 in this district was a continuation of that which prevailed
?(113) in the preceding year, and assumed still greater intensity. Diarrhoea also, and dysentery, were very prevalent and fatal this year. In January, February, and March cholera was prevalent in the tea plantations at the foot of the hills, and in April extended to Kurseong and the vicinity of Darjiling; all this time the disease was prevailing severely in the Terai, which it never left till the cessation of the epidemic generally. In May there was a decided and general increase of cholera, and in June the disease attained its maximum intensity and most fatal type, spreading all over the whole district, but lessening in the plains and increasing in the hills. Of the 910 deaths registered in June, 509 occurred in Kurseong, 199 in Darjiling, 82 in Kalimpong, and the remainder in the Terai. In the civil station of Dar- jiling, the first case occurred on the 11th June, but the disease never got much hold on the sanitarium, the few cases that occurred being of a sporadic character, and only 11 of them proved fatal. With the heavy rains of July a great and general improvement took place, and early in August the disease quite disappeared. The mortuary returns show that 1,734 deaths occurred during this outbreak, but Dr. Purves is of opinion that only about half the actual mortality was recorded. On the subject of the diet of the working- classes he says:-" If no better present itself, the veriest carrion is devoured, and human beings, birds, and beasts have been seen fighting over the same carcase. * * * They seldom miss a chance of gorging themselves with food, putrid or otherwise, and probably follow this up by getting drunk and lying out all night in the cold and damp." Regarding the cholera in the tea plantations, it is stated., that the immunity of the Europeans living in the midst of this epidemic was remarkable, although they attended the sick and buried the dead. This, Dr. Purves ascribes to good accomodation, suit- able food, good drinking-water and clothing, and attention to the general laws of sanitation. With regard to the conditions of life of the poorer classes who live on coarse, deficient, and innutritious food, Dr. Purves noticed that the habitations of the labouring classes, particularly of the coolies in the gardens, were crowded together; that too many lived in one house; that the houses were surrounded with filth; that conservancy in the cooly lines was limited, the refuse and filth being left undisturbed; that the discharges of those who were attacked by cholera were allowed to saturate the floor of the houses, or were thrown outside near the huts. Jalpaiguri.-During the first three months of 1876 cholera was present in a very mild form; in April it gradually assumed an epidemic form over an extensive area; in May it prevailed very severely; and in June it reached its maximum intensity in extent and fatality. In August it declined, and from September to December there was great immunity from the disease. Altogether the cholera of 1876 was less severe in this district than in 1875. It is stated that movements from an affected locality invariably checked if it did not entirely put a stop to the spread of the disease, and that the poorly- fed suffered the most. Dhaka.-The cholera mortality of this district in 1876 was nearly double that of the preceding year. The outbreak of the disease in October 1875 continued to rage almost all over the district up to the end of January 1876. In February it declined to a great extent, but in March and April its virulence increased, and it continued to prevail epidemically until the middle of May. It was less prevalent from June to September, but prevailed again in October and lasted up to the close of the year, November and December being months of great suffering. The whole district suffered, and the mortality in its 15 circles of registration was very severe. The Civil Surgeon believes that the lesser prevalence of the disease during the months from June to September than at other times of the year was due to the inundation which took place in the southern and part of the northern portions of the district during this period. Faridpur.-In this district 1876 was a year of unusually excessive prevalence of cholera, and also of great fatality, the death-rate having risen from 217 to 932 per 1,000 of population. Here also the cold weather out- break of 1875 continued on to January of this year. In February it declined, but in March and April it prevailed epidemically. From May it commenced to decline and continued to do so rapidly up to September. From June to Q
(114) September the district was almost free from the disease, which is usually the case in those parts which are subject to fresh water inundation of the river Padda which kept the country under water till September. This immunity is also due to the heavy rains of the season. In October the disease again became epidemic, and continued so up to the end of the year. The circles in the north of the district, on comparatively elevated alluvial soil-earlier formations of the river Padda-suffered more in the earlier than in the later epidemic. The circles in the central and southern portions of the district are comparatively low, and suffered most in the cold weather epidemic. In these low tracts are extensive swamps with an abundant growth of vegetation, which commences to rot in the cold weather after the subsidence of the inundation water. Of the two circles on the alluvial formations situated between the two large divisions of the Ganges in this district, viz., the Padda and the Areal Khan, that of Sadarpur suffered most in the cold weather epidemic, and that of Palong almost equally during both epidemics. Every circle in this district was very severely attacked, and in all of them the mortality was very high. "The cyclone touched a small portion of the south- east portion of this district, and very partially flooded this part of the country: the water was fresh and of little depth; dead animals did not fill the tanks and streams, and cholera did not ensue." Bakirganj.-In this district cholera is always present to a great extent. The extension of the disease from the close of 1875 to the commencement of 1876, and the March to May, and October to December prevalence of the disease, with the interval of subsidence from June to September, also obtained here. It has been observed that in this district the increase or decrease of cholera, whether the disease prevails epidemically or endemically, is greatly influenced by the fall and rise of the river streams, tanks, swamps, &c., all over the district with the seasons of the year. When the water of the rains is evapo- rating in September, and again after the storms of March, the disease prevails in the highest degree. When the rains have well set, and the earth is saturated, and the storm water is flowing freely, it prevails in the least degree. " Bakir- ganj is a flat alluvial country; the highest parts are the banks of the rivers, and the lowest levels are those between the large rivers. The whole district is intersected by numerous rivers having a southerly direction, with numerous connecting channels between them. Cholera first attacks those parts of the country which are affected by the fall in the height of the water level after the cessation of the rains, and these are the highest parts of the country near the banks of the large rivers. In its spread it follows the fall of the country and the retreating water. The circumstances attending several local outbreaks that took place during the year in the district bear out the above observations. The tanks, which are very numerous in each village, have their banks usually covered with trees; dead leaves fall into the water, and all sorts of refuse are cast, and fill the hollows and slopes leading to them. "The winter prevalence of the disease took place in this district, as usual, in October with a mortality rising from 37 deaths in September to 399 in October, against 94 and 490 deaths respectively in the corre- sponding months of the preceding year. These facts indicate that, independ- ently of the action of the cyclone and storm wave which visited the east of this district, and greatly aggravated the severity of the disease, the winter epidemic prevelance of the malady had been called forth by the other con- ditions capable themselves of bringing it into activity. On the night of the 31st October 1876, a severe cyclone, accompanied, about midnight, by storm waves rising to a height variously estimated at from 10 to 20 feet, and in some places higher, occurred in the Bay of Bengal, and burst over principally this, the Noakhali, and the Chittagaon districts. The storm waves affected this district as far as Ferozepur, but especially the eastern portion-the islands of the Dakhan Shahbazpur sub-division in the estuary of the Megna and the Ganges. Besides causing an immense loss to life and property, this calamity greatly increased the ordinary insanitary conditions of the affected localities. The dead bodies of men and animals were left exposed on the fields all over the country. Swarms of flies were generated in the decomposing carcasses, the stench was unbearable, vultures and jackals would not touch them.
(115) Although the water of the storm wave was fresh, the tanks were in many cases polluted by the dead bodies, and in all cases they were filled by the straw, thatch, branches of trees, and other debris, the foul contents of hollows, &c., swept on by the waves. The people were houseless or imperfectly sheltered under temporary sheds. They were living on damaged new rice. They were so awed and paralysed by the sudden devastation and the many deaths, that they neither burnt nor buried the dead, rebuilt their huts, nor cleared their tanks, notwithstanding that every means short of force was used by the local authorities to induce them to do so.* * * Very little cholera, however, occurred in the wave-stricken tracts before the middle of December, * * * and the disease was neither so severe nor general here as in Noakhali and Chittagaon and the islands near them which were surrounded by salt water.* * * "But when the cholera did break out, it was of the most fatal nature, and was followed on its decline by diarrhoea, dysentery, and dyspepsia. "Cholera broke out early in December, with a tendency to become epidemic, in the extreme north of the Dhakhan Shahabazpur sub-division. By the beginning of January the disease travelled southwards, and appeared in a most virulent form throughout this sub-division during the first ten days of the month. It began to abate soon after manifesting this severity in all the northern half of the sub-division. Some showers at the end of January caused it greatly and generally to decrease, and it disappeared entirely and imme- diately after the copious rainfall that occurred early in February." Under the circumstances reliable information of the casualties that occurred could not be obtained: 8,000 deaths were, however, estimated to have occurred in this sub-division during this period. In the three circles of the Patuakhali sub-division the disease was severe and fatal from the end of December to the end of January. The rainfall towards the end of this month checked the disease here also, and the very heavy rainfall in the first week of February caused it suddenly to cease in toto. The estimated deaths from this cause were 4,450. A small portion of the Bakirganj circle-Darial-was also visited by the epidemic; estimated deaths 300. Mymensingh.-" In common with the other districts in Eastern Bengal, Mymensingh has its period of endemic prevalence of cholera from November until the occurrence of the periodical storms in May, of increasing violence from March to May and again from October to December, and of subsidence from June to September." The cholera of January 1876 was a continuation of that of the preceding year. During February and March the disease had subsided considerably, but in April it became severe, and culminated in severity in May, after which it subsided till November, when it reassumed its severe character. The district was comparatively free from the disease during June to October. The east and south-eastern portion of the district, in which are extensive swamps bordering on the Megna, suffered most severely. In the rains this part of the country is a vast sheet of water. In the west the disease was very prevalent up to the middle of December, especially along the Jabuna. The northern half of the district was free from cholera in the November and Decem- ber outbreak, while the disease prevailed freely in the southern half: in the earlier outbreak of this year as well as in other years the northern half did not escape. Tipperah.-The same periods of prevalence and subsidence of cholera occurred here as in the other districts of Eastern Bengal. The disease broke out soon after the inundation in August 1875, and prevailed severely up to the end of May 1876. From June to September it subsided, when it reappeared and continued up to the end of the year. It followed no particular course, but occurred in different parts of the district simultaneously. The whole of the west face of the district which borders on the Megna and is intersected by streams and water-courses is much more liable annually to endemic cholera than the eastern half which is bordered by the Tipperah hills, and in which there are comparatively fewer streams and water-courses. The drying up of the heavy floods of August 1875 was followed by excessive drought. Chittagaon.-Two epidemics of cholera occurred in this district, where the disease is endemic in 1876. The first beginning at the close of the unusually severe rainy season of 1875 and ending practically with the rains of 1876 Q 2
(116) prevailed pretty widely over the district. The other, the most disastrous of any on record, followed in the train of the cyclone inundation which burst upon this district on the night of the 31st October. The rains which were unprece- dentedly excessive during June and July 1875 culminated during the first week of August in a serious inundation which deluged the half of the north-east of the district. This was followed by a season of unusual dryness, and the soil which during the rains became over-saturated now became abnormally dried up by the sinking of the sub-soil water.* * * Moreover, the rays of the sun acting upon the inundated ground caused the evaporation of malaria, and so the general unhealthiness caused by the other factors, such as bad food, unsuit- able dwellings, bad or absence of all conservancy, was increased. " A notable fact mentioned by the Magistrate is that the Maghs down Cox's Bazar, who eat putrid fish habitually, and whose houses are raised on piles, and all the offices of nature performed through the floor, and the ground beneath never cleaned for generations, had no cholera." The second epidemic broke out suddenly in November, almost immediately after the cyclone and storm wave which swept over the eastern portion of this district on the 1st of that month, extending inland from three to six miles along the coast. The deaths in November were 2,101 and in December 5,261. The high military road from Dhaka to Chitta- gaon was the inland boundary of the wave in the north of this district. The inundation lasted only a few hours. Cholera was severest and soonest in inci- dence in the north, later and less intense in the south which was farthest from the centre of the cyclone (the inundation came from the west and south-west gathering force and volume as it passed to the east). The whole district was affected, Cox's Bazar excepted. Where the storm wave did not encroach, there was a comparatively little cholera. Europeans who are careful about sanitary arrangements, and who, in the Sadr station, live upon the hills and elevated dry ground, suffered little. Besides prevailing extensively, this epidemic was very fatal. Out of 8,464 persons specially reported by the police to have been attacked in November and December, 7,362, or nearly 87 per cent., were said to have died. Naokhali.-Cholera in this district, as regards its endemic prevalence, epi- demic intensity, and seasonal subsidence, does not differ from that of the other districts in Eastern Bengal. The summer prevalence of the disease in 1876 was not generally severe or epidemic in character, but during April and May it was prevalent in every circle, and those parts of the district which are near the large rivers, particularly to the south and south-east, suffered most. Dr. Lyons, the Civil Surgeon, says:-" Both the disease and its cause are never absent, being aggravated by atmospheric and other conditions which are not yet sufficiently understood. One of the conditions I have noticed lately and wish to convey is that a very perceptible heat is felt from the earth upwards for several feet, accompanied in parts by unpleasant smells noticeable along the roads and over ground apparently dry and well formed. These are forced on the attention only in such places where the sun is acting powerfully, so that when it rains heaviest and the country is under water, the active causes, whatever they may be, are kept in check." He adds that not any of the Europeans, native officials, or other well-to-do people suffered from the disease, notwithstanding that the epidemic raged with extreme severity in Sadharam. The inundation caused by the cyclone, and which was pretty much, if not entirely, of salt water, involved the whole of the southern portion of the district, and affected all its registering circles, except those of Ramganj and Begumganj. Early in November (the third or fourth) cholera broke out epidemically throughout the inundated tracts, and caused very severe mortality, the deaths in November and December in these tracts being no less than 16,125 out of a total of 18,461 deaths in the same area during the whole year. Patna.-The character of cholera in this as well as the other districts of the western division of Bihar differs in point of seasonal prevalence from that of the disease in the districts of Lower Bengal. In the western Bihar districts there is no second or winter epidemic, nor continued prevalence of cholera from the close of one year to the opening of the next, both the earlier and later months of the year being markedly free from the disease; the period of maximum intensity being from April to June. In 1876 cholera prevailed very severely and fatally in the Bihar sub-division in June; in Dehree there
(117) was an outbreak among the coolies on the canal works at Barh in May, and in April the disease broke out in Dinapore. Gya.-Cholera prevailed throughout the year, observing the normal course of the seasonal prevalence. The southern and central portions of the district were chiefly affected, and villages situated long distances apart from each other were simultaneously attacked. Shahabad.-Cholera prevailed in this district severely from May to July inclusive, less so in August and September, and in a mildly sporadic form during the remaining months of the year. The villages which were " literally clean suffered equally with those of which the sanitary conditions were bad. The heat was unusually great, and the rainfall scanty. The coincidence of cholera prevalence with scanty rainfall has been observed several times during previous years, particularly in 1873 when the rains were late and insufficient, and a severe epidemic of cholera prevailed." Mozaffarpur.-Cholera was present most severely in May and June, in the other months presenting very few cases. The disease did not concentrate itself in any particular locality. The heat was above the average during May and June, and no rainfall from September to April, and scarcely any till the end of May. Many of the tanks and wells dried up, and many of the wells had only 18 inches of water in them, and the river was nearly dry. When the rains set in in July, the disease ceased. Darbhanga.-" Cholera first made its appearance in March in the eastern and southern outskirts of the district. It then spread to the northern and western boundaries, and having encircled the district, proceeded centrically in a gradual and uniform manner, reaching the sadr station some two months after its first appearance. It was present for a whole month in the sadr station, after which it suddenly disappeared both from it and the eastern districts. A day or two prior to its disappearance from the sadr station a severe thunder-storm occurred, remarkable for a copious liberation of electricity and for very little rainfall, so little indeed that it barely sufficed to lay the dust." Saran.-Cholera was severe from April to September, particularly so from June to August. In the other months it was very mild. It spread in desultory manner. Men suffered in a greater proportion than women. The Civil Surgeon writes:-" The exciting cause of the malady was, I believe, the atmos phere impregnated in some instances by emanations from cholera evacuations, and by means of water polluted by cholera discharges. The pre-disposing causes were debility, intemperance, depression of spirits from fear of infection, insuffi- cient food, malarious influences, damp impure air, and water. I have not been able to satisfy myself that the appearance of cholera was dependent upon any particular local or insanitary condition either in respect to conservancy or drainage, nor does there appear to be any special reason why some places suffered more than others. Champaran.-In the opinion of Dr. Meadows, the Civil Surgeon, "the prevalence of cholera in this district seems to be dependent on climatic conditions. * * * One fact is evident, that its annual appearance may be looked for to a certainty in April or May, followed by a cessation in August, rarely later than September, and one or two years of immunity followed by a virulent outbreak." The cholera of 1876 compared with the outbreaks of the preceding three years was severe and the mortality higher. Commenc- ing early in April in the Motihari and Piprah circles, the disease spread rapidly in all directions, and increasing steadily in virulence reached its maximum intensity in June, when every circle in the district with the exception of three situated in the extreme north suffered to a greater or less extent. In August the disease was widely distributed throughout the district. In September the outbreaks ceased, only a few sporadic cases being met with here and there. Monghyr.-The seasonal characteristics of cholera in this district are the same as those of the disease in Lower Bengal districts; it is little prevalent in January and February; prevails severely from March to June, subsides in September, and breaks out afresh in October, and continues to prevail with abated severity until the end of the year. In 1876 there were several sharp outbreaks in different parts of the district between March and May, and again
?(118) in October. The disease was not confined to any particular locality, but was often found to be present in widely separated villages. Bhagalpur.-In this district the endemic cholera often assumes the epidemic form. March to August is the period of greatest prevalence; Septem- ber and October are months of subsidence, and January and February and November and December are months of marked immunity from the disease. In 1876 cholera was spread over the whole district, but, on the whole, the visitation was not severe. A large number of cases in the town of Bhagalpur occurred among children. Parnia.-The periods of immunity, increase, and subsidence of cholera in this district resemble those observed in Bhagalpur. The disease was not severe in 1876, though every circle was affected, and there were smart and fatal outbreaks in some of them. In this year the rainfall, 6485 inches, was above the average, 6254 inches, of several previous years. In 1873 the rainfall was only 33 inches, and the disease prevailed epidemically. Sonthal.-The periods of cholera prevalence, subsidence, and immunity in this district are same as in the other districts of Eastern Bihar, except that there is exacerbation of the disease in November and December. In 1876 cholera first appeared in February among the pilgrims assembled in the town of Deogarh for the Shibrath festival, and rapidly spread to the neighbouring villages where it continued until May, March being the month of greatest prevalence. In the Godda sub-division cholera commenced in March and lasted till August; in April, May, and June the disease spread over the whole sub-division, and these were the months of greatest suffering. During the rains the disease subsided greatly, but it reappeared after their cessation, and was very severe in November. " Village after village was attacked, but the affected villages were at a great distance from one another." Kattak.-Cholera prevailed with greatest severity throughout the year 1876, but May, June, and July were the months of greatest suffering. There was scanty rainfall and drought here in this year. " It is worthy of notice that though so many thousands of pilgrims pass through Kattak year by year carrying cholera with them, the European residents have never suffered from it. The Madras Regiment, too, almost invariably escapes." * * * Puri.-A very severe and wide spread epidemic outbreak of cholera occur- red in this  district  in  1876.    It  commenced  in  January   and  lasted  until August.    In March, June, and July, the last mentioned month particularly, it was most virulent and fatal in character.    In January the disease was present both in the district and in the town.    In many  places  far  from  the  pilgrim routes  the disease prevailed virulently:   " notably among them are Gop, where it was  severe,  and  the  Karnalla  and neighbouring villages   in parganah, Chowkisbad  bordering on the Chilka lake, in the  Puri  circle, where it  was most virulent this year, while in the previous one there was hardly any present in this locality.    There was no communication between these villages  and the nearest pilgrim route. With regard to the prevalence of the disease among the pilgrims themselves, the usual oft-repeated causes were in operation, principally fatigue  and  exposure during  the long journeys that they undertake, errors of diet, coarse, uncooked food, polluted water, damp earth, night chills along  the road, &c.    On arrival at Puri the people  are  densely crowded,   sleep outside, eat bad food, drink foul water, and their defoecations pollute the soil.    During the festival they are in a high state of religious excitement, and this is followed by utter mental depression, and they  are also  subjected to much exposure, as the festival takes place in the beginning of the rains (June) when the pilgrims have to walk about in the wet, and lie on the damp ground.    It is noted that the record relating to the mortality  among pilgrims  could not be  completed this year, but the ascertained number of pilgrims who  died  in the Puri circle was 508, of whom 274 succumbed to cholera, and the rest to the other diseases, principally  bowel-complaints.    Of this  number again  204 were  victims  to cholera during the months of June and July when the car festival  took  place. A   high   temperature  with  maximum   rainfall   is  mentioned as  the  great concomitant of the severe prevalence of the disease this year as compared with the preceding year.    The temperature during the first seven  months  of 1876 was much higher than it was during the corresponding  period  of  1875  while the rainfall was much less, the mean temperature for this period in the former
?(119) year being 8118 against 8007 in the latter, and the total rainfall 1138 against 2978 inches. It is to be regretted -that no account has been furnished regarding the outbreak that occurred in November and December, as such an inquiry would no doubt elicit the causes apart from importation by pilgrims which bring about the disease in the district, through the Gop circle of which they do not pass. It is remarkable that the Europeans living in Puri are always exempt from cholera attacks, though they are often surrounded by the disease to a great extent. The same holds good in Balasur also. The cause is as plain here as elsewhere, viz., they live comfortably. Balasur.-The cholera of 1876 in this district was much more severe than that of 1875, and was present throughout the year. Its periods of severity were during March to August, and again in November and December, but the maximum intensity and fatality was during June to August inclusive, the pilgrim period. February, September, and October were months of great immunity. The disease first appeared in Chandbali in January, and in February spread; up to August it was present in every circle in the district. The south suffered to a greater extent than the north. Hazaribagh.-In this as in the other districts of Chota Nagpur, the period of the intensity of cholera is from March to August, the months preceding and following this period being months of great immunity from the disease. In 1876 cholera was present in 5 circles in March, and in June became generally prevalent in the district, but it was not generally severe or very fatal, although its prevalence was greater in this year than in 1875. Lohardagga.-The first case of cholera in this district in 1876 appeared on the 2nd March in the Silli circle, and on the 24th March in the Ranchee circle. By the end of that month it was present in the Ranchi town, Doranda cantonment, and neighbouring villages. In Ranchi the disease was very severe in July. By the end of August cholera commenced declining, and disappeared by the end of September. The circles in the Palamow sub-division suffered very severely between May and September. Singbhum.-There was very little cholera in this district in 1876, and the mortality was lower than in the preceding year. The cases were scattered, and 14 out of the 34 circles escaped the disease altogether. The disease prevailed severely in only three or four villages in the south of the district. Manbhum.-A few cases of cholera occurred here and there in the district during January and February; in March the disease became more widely prevalent; and during May and June was generally prevalent, every circle being affected except that of Barabhum, which remained exempt from the disease throughout the year. The disease was most severe in the months of June, May, July, and April, in the order of their mention. From August the disease began to decline, and during September to December there were only a few scattered cases. Dr. Wilson, the Civil Surgeon, says that four-fifths of the deaths took place in the hottest and driest months (March, April, May, and half of June), which accords with the general experience in these parts, while the remaining one-fifth of the casualties occurred in the rains (latter half of June, July, August, September, and first half of October) with the exception of 14 deaths, which happened in winter. This season of the year is inimical to cholera, as has been remarked all over the world. The incidence of the cholera of 1876 among the troops and jail populations in this province is shown in the subjoined abstract statement. Among the European troops-total average strength 2,983-there were altogether 11 admissions and 8 deaths from cholera, giving a death-rate of 2-68 per mille of strength. Of the 5 stations occupied by the European troops, the 4 following recorded cholera in 1876:- Fort William   ... ... Strength  934 Admissions 3 Deaths 3 Dum-Dum      ... ...   634  1  1 Barrackpur     ... ...   440  1  1 Dinapur          ... ...   874  6  3 The strength of the affected troops is 2,882, the percentage of admissions to strength 038, and of deaths to admissions 73. Of the 11 admissions, there were 2 in March, 6 in April, and 3 in May.
?(120) Among the families of the European soldiers there was the following cholera recorded in 1876. Women-total average strength 295-admissions 1, death 1, at Dum-Dum-strength 67-in May. Children-total average strength 552-admissions 2, deaths 2 at Fort William-strength 120; viz. 1 in March and 1 in May. Among the native troops-total average strength 5,339-there were altogether 18 admissions and 14 deaths from cholera, giving a death-rate of 262 per mille of strength. Of the 12 stations occupied by the native troops, the 5 following recorded cholera in 1876 :- Alipore           Strength    893 Admissions     1 Deaths  1 Barrackpore                984  4  5 Dacca  215  3  2 Bhagalpur           365  2  2 Dinapur               572  8  4 The strength of the affected troops is 3,029, the percentage of admissions to strength is 059, and of deaths to admissions 78. Of the 18 admissions, there were 1 in February, 2 in March, 3 in April, 3 in May, 4 in June, 1 in July, 2 in August, and 2 in November. Among the jail populations-total average strength 20,708-there were altogether 536 admissions and 273 deaths from cholera, giving a death-rate of 1318 per mille of strength. Of the 49 jails in the province, the 36 following recorded cholera in 1876 :-- Jessore         Strength    540 Admissions    3 Deaths    3 Kishnagarh      361  1  1 Murshidabad       506  26  8 Hughli              599  34  11 Bardwan       392  21  11 Bankura         300  1  1 Purulia           256  12  8 Suri                   233  7  1 Nya Dumka         102  8  0 Dinajpur      638  51  2 Rajshahi        961  4  18 Mymensingh         491  12  3 Pubna        150       12  9 Faridpur      334  2  1 Bakirganj        453      29  15 Noakhalli           211    5  3 Chittagong        257  12  4 Dacca           695  12  4 Midnapur      1,002       2  0 Balasur         168  6  4 Cuttack               286  10  6 Puri              87  1  1 Monghyr         383  1  0 2 Bhagalpur, C. and D     1,053  19  9 Jalpaiguri            145  17  13 Ranchi                249  29  19 Hazaribagh       1,044  71  38 Gya              427  8  3 Patna          439  14  12 Arrah                 432  10  6 Buxar               653  2  2 Champarun        246  16  12 Muzaffarpur          590  36  19 Durbhanga        296  9  5 Chapra        328  44  21
?(121) The strength of the affected jails is 15,307, the percentage of admissions to strength 350, and of deaths to admissions 51. Of the 536 admissions, there were 8 in January, 73 in March, 110 in April, 80 in May, 50 in June, 118 in July, 36 in August, 1 in September, 13 in October, 17 in November, and 30 in December. Meteorology.-No remarks. Food-supply.-In 1876 the price of rice had risen in several districts, particularly in Eastern Bengal, West Tirhut, and Orissa; the prices of wheat and the pulses were lower throughout the other districts than the averages of the preceding three years excluding 1874 (the famine year), with the solitary exceptions of Naddia in wheat and Lohardagga in pulses. The highest prices for food-grains ruled in Darjiling, Chittagaon, Julpaiguri, Rungpur, and Naokhali. In Eastern Bengal the rise in prices is due to the cyclone. On the whole, however, food was cheaper than in recent years throughout the province; the rainfall of the year was plentiful and seasonable. In the greater number of the districts wages continued to be the same throughout the year as compared with the preceding year, and wherever there was a change, the tendency of the change was rather towards a rise than fall in wages.

Cholera in Bengal Province during the year 1877. Lithographed at the Survey of India Offices, Calcutta, January 1885.
?(   125    ) BENGAL PROVINCE, 1877. The monthly mortality registered from cholera among the civil population of the province during 1877 is shown in the annexed tabular statement. Of the total 155,305 deaths 84,918 were of males and 70,387 of females. The rate per mille of population is 258 and per cent. of all deaths registered 1441. In 1877 cholera was present in the province in every month of the year, and visited every district, as shown in the annexed statement. Out of the 663 registering circles it prevailed epidemically in 88 against 154 in 1876; was severe in 103 against 178 ; mildly prevalent in 410 against 315, and entirely absent from 62 against 19. The total mortality registered was 155,305 against 196,590 in 1876, giving a death-rate of 258 per mille of population against 327, and 1441 per cent. of all deaths against 1999 in the preceding year. As compared with its prevalence in 1876, cholera was markedly on the decline in 1877, but the disease was nevertheless severely prevalent in parti- cular localities, and districts that suffered most were those shown in the subjoined statment:- District.

Cholera in the Bengal Province in 1877. The high range of mortality in January and February of this year is unusual, and entirely due to an exceptional cause, viz, the epidemic contin- uance in the Bakirganj, Chittagong, and Noakholli districts of the cholera developed by the great cyclone wave inundation of October and November 1876. In Bengal Proper the year 1877 opened with a severe prevalence of cholera in the whole of the southern portion of the central districts, in all the eastern districts, and in Beerbhum, Hughli, and Howrah of the western districts. Within this area the disease continued to prevail until May, being markedly severe in Nuddea, Howrah, Jessore, Dhaka, faridpur, and Tipperah
(126) and epidemic in the cyclone-stricken areas of Bakirganj, Chittagong, and Noakholli. From June to August cholera prevailed very mildly, and was entirely absent from several districts in some of the months of this period. Darjiling, which was epidemically visited in 1876, enjoyed immunity from the disease almost throughout the year. The autumnal epidemic, commencing in September and continuing to the close of the year, prevailed with severity only at Howrah in the western districts, in the northern and central portions of the central districts, and in the eastern districts, with the exception of Bakirganj, Chittagong, and Noakhalli; the districts most severely visited by the cholera of this season were Nuddea, Jessore, Dinagepore, Pabna, Bogra, and Mymensingh. In Bihar cholera prevailed very mildly during the first three months of the year, except in Maldah (which during the year was transferred to this division), where it prevailed severely from January to May. From January to March Darbhanga and Chumparan were markedly free from cholera. As usual, however, the disease prevailed in a severe form all over Bihar from April to August, or even September in some places, whilst in Parnia, (which borders on Dinagepore), and Maldah in Bengal, it also prevailed in the cold season. The districts which suffered most severely were Chumparan, Mozuaf- forpore, Darbhanga, Monghyr, and Bhagulpore. In Orissa the periods of severe prevalence correspond with those of Bengal, viz. from January to May and September to December. But in 1877 the spring outbreak continued untill August in Puri, and the autumn outbreak began in August in Kattak. Cholera was epidemic in Puri during the early outbreak and most severe in Kattak during the winter, and in Balasore during the early visitation. In Chota Nagpore the cholera of 1877 prevailed with marked mildness throughout the year. The conditions associated with soil, air, water, drainage conservancy, diet, crowding, climate, &c., &c., reported from year to year to favour the develop- ment of cholera were again referred to this year as the exciting and predisposing causes of the disease. The following particulars are gathered from the history given of the incidence of cholera in districts. Beerbhum.-Cholera prevailed generally from January to March, and most severely in the easterly parts of the districts, in which area lie two places of pilgrimage, viz. the Baidnath and the Ganges. After March the disease almost left the district, and out of 693 deaths only 16 occurred in the five months June to October. 24.Purgunnahs.-Regarding the prevalence of cholera in the Baripore sub- division, it is stated that cholera breaks out very soon after the rice crops are removed from the fields which are then exposed to the full action of the sun. In the lower parts of the country where the extensive rice swamps continue submerged until the end of February or March, the disease breaks out later than in the higher parts. In the cold weather a shower of rain acts as a temporary check, and in the rainy season when the soil is saturated, vegetation rank, and the land covered with crops, cholera disappears. Those parts of the country which are subject to inundations suffer most after the subsidence of the floods. Bad living and consumption of new rice and the fresh toddy of the date-tree have also some connection with the spread of cholera. " At the fair held during eight days in January in Sagur Island, and attended by about 50,000 people, cholera broke out and caused 15 deaths; at the fair held at Harwa during seven days in February, and attended also by about 50,000 people, cholera appeared and caused four deaths. In the January fair, the outbreak abated after a shower of rain." Jaisur.-The cholera of 1876 continued to prevail, but with diminished fatality, in the Magura, Bhagirhat, and Khulna sub-divisions until June when it sunk to its minimum. In November the disease broke out afresh, and spread generally over the district, and was severest in December. Murshidabad.-Cholera raged with great virulence during April and May, and during October and December. "These outbreaks were not confined to particular localities, but occurred simultaneously in different parts of the district remote from each other, and in a few days spread throughout the district.'
(127) Rangpur.-This year cholera prevailed mildly on the whole in this district; in fact the disease was absent from a great portion of the district for several months between January and November. Jaldhaka and Dimla escaped entirely. The disease was severely prevalent in Bhawaniganj and Sadullahpur in May and June, and again in November and December. At Bhawaniganj it broke out at the junction of the Teesta with the Brahmaputra, and thence spread to Sadullahpur; it then abated, but broke out afresh at the end of October, and soon extending over the area in which it had previously prevailed spread south-west to Govindpur. The disease is endemic in the district, and, it is said, " generally breaks out on both banks of the Brahmaputra, attacking chiefly newly settled villages on the sand banks of that river." Bogra.-Except some smart outbreaks in the Khetlal circle from March to May and in the Panchbibi circle from May to July, there was very little cholera in this district up to September. In October the disease appeared in Shariakandi, and spreading to the continuous circles of Bogra and Sherpur, became general throughout the district and rather severe. Pabna.-Up to June cholera was not severe in this district, and from July to September the greater portion of the district was free from the disease. But the winter cholera was very severe. It commenced in Serajganj town in September, extended to six circles in October and to the remaining portion of the district in November, in which month and December it prevail- ed most severely. The disease proved very fatal in every circle. This outbreak at Serajganj appears to have extended into the Bogra district (above described) immediately to the north. " A rather smart outbreak attended with severe mortality occurred among the floating population of the boats collected for trading purposes at Serajganj. These people numbered from 20,000 to 30,000, and very little sanitary supervision was exercised over them. They were dispersed; the disease abated, and the diminution was ascribed to the dispersion. Had it suddenly developed itself all over the country, the dispersion would have been accused of doing the mischief by disseminating the germs broadcast." Dhaka.-As in former years, the January cholera in this  district was a continuation of the autumn  outbreak of  the preceding year. The  disease declined in February and March, but in April it increased rapidly, and became very general. In May and June it gradually abated,  and in July, August, and September when most of the country was several feet under water, the greater part of the district was free from it. In October cholera broke out afresh and prevailed in several circles with much severity.  In November it spread all over the district and continued to prevail up to the end of the year. Dr. Crombie commenting on the fluctuations of cholera in this district writes:-"Looking for causes which are likely to be factors in producing the yearly fluctuations of cholera giving rise to its spontaneous or at least to its simultaneous outbreak in  certain months  and its  decline  and disappearance  all  over it in other months,  one is  struck, in the first place, by the absence  of epidemic  cholera during the season of the  annual inundation.    During the  months of July, August, and September when about eight-tenths  of the district  is  under 3 to 4 feet of water and all the ground not submerged is  soaked  with  constant rain, there is  no  cholera.    Whether  this  may  be  due to the clearing of the village nullahs   *    *    *    or to the filling up of the village tanks,    *    *    * or whether it is due to the  submersion of the surface  of the  country from which the cholera poison emerges at other seasons,  or whether or not the occurrence of the annual  flooding and the cessation  of cholera all  over the district are simply a coincidence, the two phenomena being independent of each other as regards causation, are questions upon which  there  are  probably as many opinions as minds.    This at least must be conceded, that  on the fall of the rivers and the exposure of the  surface to the  sun  cholera begins again to manifest itself,    During   October  cases occur  simultaneously in widely separated parts of the  district,  and in November there is scarcely a village  of 500 inhabitants that has not its cases  or  deaths from cholera,  and so in December.    But in January, February,  and March,  without any flooding, there is an evident amelioration of the cholera  conditions, which are  again paramount everywhere  in April, to lose their power in  May  without any of the country coming under water.    In June the  rivers rise and flood the
?(  128  ) country, and cholera disappears. Should it be admitted that the annual disappearance of cholera is caused by its being drowned out by the annual flooding during the rains, it must still be allowed that there are other seasonal influences which control its causes at other seasons. Is it the subsoil water ? There is a steady fall of the level of the subsoil water during the last three months of the year, during which cholera reaches its greatest prevalence. During the month of October (1877) the level of the subsoil water fell from 5 feet on the 1st to 7 feet 7 inches on the 31st, i.e., it fell 1 inch every day, and the fall was steady. In November the fall was still more rapid, being at the rate of 1? inches in the first half of the month and 2 inches daily in the second, the total fall during November being 4 feet 6 inches. In Decem- ber the fall was not so rapid, but it was from 12 feet 3 inches from the 30th November to 14 feet 10 inches on the 31st December, or exactly 1 inch every day. But in January the level of the subsoil water is still falling, and the prevalence of cholera becomes greatly mitigated. In 1877 the observations at Dhaka show that it fell steadily through 1 foot 5 inches during January, and the deaths in the district fell from 2,700 in December 1876 to 1,100 in January 1877. During February the subsoil water-level fell 28 inches, and the deaths were not 450. On the 1st March it was 18 feet from the surface of the ground, and it fell 7 inches between the 1st and 21st and then began to rise, rising 6 inches during the remaining ten days of the month. The deaths from cholera were 400. The level of the subsoil water rose 20 inches in the first 17 days of April, and fell 22 inches by the end of the month, and stood 18 feet 2 inches on the 31st. There were 1,300 deaths from cholera during the month. During the month of May the level fluctuated. It fell during the first week, rose 10 inches in the second week, and fell 4 inches in the third week, and remained nearly stationary till the end of the month. The deaths from cholera were 650. In June it rose rapidly during the first half of the month, and fluctuated during the second. Cholera had now nearly disappeared. On the 1st July the subsoil water was 5 feet 4 inches from the surface, and it rose to 4 feet 3 inches on the 21st, falling .towards the end of the month. The country was now under water, and there was no cholera. In August the level was still rising, but in September it fell from 6 feet 2 inches on the 1st to 9 feet 4 inches on the 31st, but the country was still under water, and there was no cholera. The following statement will show what relationship, if any, existed between the level of the subsoil water and the prevalence of cholera in this district:-  Months Subsoil water. Cholera. January Falling steadily Decreasing. February Ditto Ditto. March Falling for three weeks; rising at end of month.                Ditto. April Fluctuating between 18 and 20 feet from surface Very prevalent everywhere. May Fluctuating slightly Disappearing, except at Rupjan. June First half rising rapidly second half fluctuating Had almost disappeared. July Rising from 5 feet 4 inches to 4 feet 2 inches from Surface. No cholera. August          Still rising slightly and fluctuating Ditto. September Falling steadily from 6 feet 2 inches to 9 feet 4 inches. Ditto. October Falling steadily Cholera reappearing. November Ditto. Cholera raging. December Ditto. Ditto.  From March to June the level of the subsoil water is influenced by the tides, and it probably fluctuates with a good deal of freedom through the sandy soil of the district. On this account the level is noticed to rise and fall daily, and the exact level cannot of course be given during these months. From October to February the influence of the tides is not felt so much, because during these months the rivers are falling, and the subsoil water falling more slowly with them does not feel the influence of the tides in an appreciable manner. From July to September the rivers are not tidal. Taking everything into consideration, it cannot be said that there is any parallelism between the fluctuation of the subsoil water-level and that of cholera in this district.
?(129) With a steady sinking of the subsoil water from September to March, cholera appears in October, rages with violence in November and December, and gradually becomes quiescent during the remainder of the period. It may be said that the level of the subsoil water is too deep in January, February, and March (14 to 18 feet) for its fall to have any influence, and that it was likely to act as a cause of cholera during the time it was falling through the upper strata saturated with decomposing matter; but in April the level of the sub- soil water is practically the same as in March. It fluctuates through 2 feet to 18 feet or 20 feet below the surface of the ground, and yet cholera bursts forth with renewed violence in almost every village community, and in May the condition of the subsoil water remaining unchanged, cholera is disappear- ing. It is true that in April there are frequent heavy showers of rain which are often capable in a porous soil of moistening the upper strata and thus favouring decomposition in them, but there is no difference between April and May in this respect. The showers are somewhat more frequent and heavy in May. In June the sub-soil water is rising rapidly, but cholera almost entirely disappears. It is, therefore, evident to my mind that if the annual flooding during the rains, and the rapid and steady fall of the level of the sub-soil water during the last three months of the year have any influence in causing the absence of cholera in the first period, and its general prevalence during the second, there is still some other seasonal influence at work during the remainder of the year, the cholera fluctuations of which are not influenced by them. What that other seasonal influence or combination of meteorological and other conditions may be, I am not prepared to say, though I am making it a subject of special inquiry, for which I hope I have to some extent cleared the ground by the foregoing remarks." Faridpur.-Cholera was not generally severe in this district in 1877, and the mortality was considerably lower everywhere than in 1876. Bakirganj.-Cholera in this year was confined almost entirely to the earlier months, and had almost disappeared by May. It was most severe in the areas swept by the storm waves of the cyclone of October and November 1876. The usual winter epidemic was entirely absent from the district, except in Gaurandi circle and Burisal town, where it was pretty severe, though less so than in the early months of the year. Chittagong.-As in Bakirganj, the cholera which followed the cyclone continued to rage all over Chittagong district until May, when it began to abate. In June and July the disease was present in only a few places, and suddenly and rapidly disappeared after an unprecedentedly heavy rainfall, 4135 inches, in August. This was the heaviest fall of any one month during the year, and caused inundations of the lower portions of the district. Since the rains the absence of sickness of every sort has been most remarkable. The cholera of this year began at Sitakoond in the north, and travelled rapidly to the south. Every circle in the district suffered very severely, and in several of them more so than in 1876. Noakholli.-Cholera raged from January to May, but after May it entirely disappeared. Local outbreaks occurred from November to December in  Rawganj and Begumganj, the only circles unaffected by the cyclone of 1876. The mortality was very high in most of the circles, and in several of them much higher than in 1876. The rainfall in June, July, August, and Septem- ber was very heavy, viz. 2836, 3776, 1931, and 1879 inches respectively; and the entire district was free from cholera in these months. The prevalence of cholera in this district was referrible to the same causes as governed it in Bakirganj and Chittagong. In the Orissa districts the cholera of 1877 was very severe, but on the whole less so than in 1876. In Kattak and Balasore there was a consider- able decline, and in Puri a greatly increased prevalence. In Kattak the disease was most severe in Jagalsingpur in the south, which is off the pilgrim route; while Jajipur, Aul, Patamandi, and Kendrapara, which are on the direct line followed by the pilgrims, suffered comparatively little. Moreover, as the usual seasonal outbreaks of the year culminate in March and Septem- ber, they cannot be credited wholly to pilgrims, because June and July, the months of comparative respite, are the months during which the greatest numbers are on the roads to and from Puri. In the Puri district cholera 8
?(130) was present in January in places far apart from each other, but as the pilgrims flocked in the disease rapidly increased, and became epidemic about the end of February, first in Puri town, and then along the pilgrim routes in Puri, Piplee, and Khurdah circles; it also prevailed in remote places, such as Gp, Nemapara, Bolia, Patra, and Bisnapur. In ordinary years the Ruthjatra (car festival), held in June or July, is by far more largely attended than the Doljatra (swing festival) held in February or March; but in 1877 the latter festival was a specially holy one, said to occur only once in a hundred years; and the crowd of pilgrims who come from all parts of India to visit Juggernath was estimated at 200,000-nearly four times as many as attended in ordinary years. In March cholera was at its height, and the mortality in the town of Puri was very severe, the residents suffer- ing more than the pilgrims. In April the disease ceased in the town and began to abate in the district generally but slowly. In former years it has been observed to abate rapidly until May, to revive in June and July when the second festival takes place, and abate again a second time by October. This year (1877) the disease did not abate until May, but then it slowly and steadily declined until October, a marked feature being the absence of the usual epidemic during the second festival in June and July. "In November and December the usual autumnal prevalence was coincident with a minor festival held in November. Of the total 5,795 cholera deaths registered during the year 3,905 occurred in the months of February, March, and April, and 1,230 of the number were pilgrims. The overcrowding in the town during the festival was very excessive." The existing lodging-houses could not furnish room for more than a small fraction of these men, and thousands of pilgrims had to pass their short stay in Puri in the open streets, gardens, under trees, &c., &c., with an area of three square miles nearly and a resident population of nearly 200,000 souls during the months of February and March. "The insanitary conditions of the town which have ordinarily been great were very materially increased during, and some time after this great festival. With regard to food and drink, the rice cooked in the temple and offered to Jaganath formed the main part of the food of this immense crowd. This food is often cooked of bad and unwholesome materials, and is made available for use at extremely irregular hours, sometimes very late in the evening. It is often sold when putrid and consequently injurious to robust health and deadly to those in low health. These irregularities were multiplied manifold at the great festival in March 1877, hence partial starvation on the one hand, and unwholesome food on the other no doubt predisposed the system of the pilgrims to attacks of sickness. This combined with high religious excitement, preceded by the physical discomforts of a prolonged and wearisome journey, paved the way for any disease, especially cholera. The water-supply of Puri town has been naturally bad. The nature of the soil is porous. The human excre- tions were never removed, and the soil got quite saturated with ordure. During the rains these animal matters got dissolved and percolated through the soil. Wells and tanks, which form the sources of water supply in the town, could never be expected to remain uncontaminated. Besides, the tanks are used for bathing purposes, and thousands of people are seen bathing daily. Many vegetable matters, such as rice, flowers, fruits, and leaves, are largely thrown into the tanks as necessary items of religious ceremonies. These get decomposed and vitiate the tank. During the festival the water must have grown very filthy indeed. The mass of pilgrims, who had every form of physical disadvantages predisposing them to disease, drank this concentrated filth in the shape of water, and so added another potent cause of sickness to many already existing. There is no existing means of draining the city. It is said that the roads serve the purposes of surface drains, while there is absolutely no provision for subsoil drainage. "With regard to conservancy, the efforts of the health office establishment were mainly confined to street conservancy and to providing a few latrines for public use." But they were not comprehensive, and the "work of removing night-soil had just begun when the great festival and epidemic of cholera occurred. The conservancy arrangements in private houses are bad, the private latrines consist of holes dug in the earth, and when one is filled another is opened until all available ground is dotted with these
?(    131   ) inadequately covered pest-holes. The accumulated ordure of years within a few feet of dwelling-houses must necessarily keep the dwellers obnoxious to causes of ill health. * * * This was not an exceptional state of things in the epidemic of 1877. This state of things has, I believe, (says the Civil Surgeon) continued ever since the city became an object of religious pilgrimage." The districts of Chota Nagpur enjoyed practical immunity from cholera in 1877, only about one village in 200 being affected. What cholera existed was sporadic in character, and during several months there was no sign of the prevalence of the disease, not a single circle suffered much, and 48 were quite free from cholera throughout the year. The incidence of the cholera of 1877 among the troops and jail populations in this province is shown in the subjoined abstract statements. Among the European troops, total average strength 2,797, there were 3 admissions and 2 deaths from cholera, giving a death-rate of 0'71 per mille of strength.

Of the 3 admissions there were 1 in January, 1 in October, and 1 in December. Among the families of the European troops total average strength, women 246, and children 481, there was no cholera in 1877. Among the native troops total average strength 5,592, there were altogether 9 admissions and 6 deaths from cholera, giving a death-rate of 107 per mille of strength.

Meteorology.-The following is from the summary of the meteorology of the year 1877, furnished by Mr. Eliot, the Meteorological Reporter to the Government of Bengal, from observations taken at 15 stations, the geograph- ical positions of which have been selected as to afford a fair record of the meteorology of the province. Atmospheric pressure.-"The atmospheric pressure during the greater part of the year was considerably in excess of its normal amount. At Darjiling the mean monthly pressure was in excess during the whole year, so that the increased pressure of the year appears to have been a more marked feature of the higher atmospheric strata than of the lower. This increased prevalence was probably partly due to diminished air motion. One important factor in the functional relation connecting pressure with the other physical conditions is the velocity, the relation being generally that with similar conditions of density and temperature pressure diminishes with increased velocity. Another important factor is the temperature of the air. The primary and essential result of increasing the temperature of a mass of air is to increase its pressure. But if the condition of the heated mass of air is such that expansion follows, then experience shows that increased temperature is accompanied by diminution of density, and also by diminution of pressure, and vice versa. These inverse relations of temperature and atmospheric pressure were strongly marked throughout the year. The mean monthly pressure during the first seven months was uniformly in excess. The excess in January and February averaged 075 for the province. In March it was less, varying in amount from 02 at Hazaribagh to 06 at Gya. During April and May the average excess was nearly as great as in January and February, averaging 06 for the two months and varying in amount from 04 to 08. The excess in June and July was less, averaging 035 for the province. The distribution of pressure was different during this period, the commencement of the rains, than in the early months of the year. During the first four months the pressure was relatively lowest at Hazaribagh and its neighbourhood and in Orissa, and highest at Calcutta and in Eastern Bengal. In the month of July, Eastern Bengal became the area of relatively lowest pressure, whilst Hazaribagh and Orissa were now the areas of maximum pressure. In August the pressure in every station was in defect except at Darjiling. The defect was greatest in Eastern Bengal, where it averaged 035. It was least in Bihar, where it only amounted to 01. The pressure during the two remaining months of the rains was again everywhere in excess. The average excess in September was 05. In Behar the excess was least, amount- ing to only 02, so that the area of lowest relative pressure was now transferred to Bihar. The pressure in October was 07 above the average. Bihar still continued to be the seat of lowest pressure, the excess being 055 for that area. The pressure during the remaining two months was slightly in defect, except at Darjiling. The distribution of pressure at the end of the year was similar to that of the early months, Orissa being again a region of relatively low pressure, and South-Eastern Bengal of high pressure. Thus in December the defect at Kattak was 036; whilst at Chittagong the pressure was 002 and at Calcutta 005 in excess. Temperature.-The mean temperature of the year was below the average; this was mainly caused by-continuous diminished temperature during the first six months of the year. It was one of the most marked features of the meteor- ology of the year and was, as is usually the case, accompanied by increased
?(133) air pressure. The variation of the temperature of January from the mean temperature was inconsiderable. The temperature was at the majority of the stations in defect, more especially at Sagar Island and False Point, where it was upwards of 1 below the average. The month of February was characterized by abnormally low temperature. The means for the month were only very slightly in excess of those for January. The defect varied from 32 at Chitta- gong to 53 at Berhampur. Bihar was at this time the area of lowest tem- perature in the province. The lowest temperatures of the month were recorded between the 10th and 17th. There are reasons for believing that the middle of February, which marks the termination of the cold-weather and the com- mencement of the dry hot-weather, is accompanied by considerable atmospheric disturbance and by rapid and large variations in the elements of meteorological observations. The absolute range of temperature during the month of Febru- ary was also excessive. It was greatest at Akyab, where it amounted to 41.3 and exceeded 40 at the two observing stations at Patna and Bardwan. The mean temperature continued to be below the average during the next three months. Bihar was during the whole period the area of the greatest defect of temperature. The mean temperature of Bihar during the month of March was 25 below the average, 45 during the month of April and 25 in May, During the first and second week of May the area of maximum day temper- ature had advanced from the Deccan to Bihar and the most eastern portion of the North-Western Provinces. It was during this period of maximum temperature in Bihar that the cyclone which visited Madras and its neighbour- hood on 18th to 23rd May was generated. The mean temperature of the province during the months of June, July, and August, varied very slightly from the average of previous years. The variation was greatest in Bihar, this district now forming an area of relatively high temperature. The abnormal features and distribution of the rains during this period account for the increased temperature in Bihar. The excess averaged 2 degrees for this period in Bihar. The temperature was in excess during the remainder of of the year at the majority of stations. Bihar continued during the whole of this period to be the region of highest temperature and of greatest variation of temperature from the mean. The excess in September and November in Bihar was 35 degrees for each month and in the two remaining months it was 15 degrees. The returns of Sgur Island and Calcutta show that the temperature at the north-west angle of the Bay was also excessive during the latter months of the year, so that it formed a second and smaller area of high temperature. Winds.-The mean wind directions during the year were very nearly normal. The northerly element of the dry-weather winds was more strongly marked than usual. The most important feature in the wind velocity of the year was the diminished velocity of lower air currents.* * * The diminished velocity was most strongly marked in April and May, and towards the end of the year. The tendency towards an approximate state of equilibrium of atmospheric condition around and near the coast of the Bay of Bengal, which often, if not always, precedes the formation of a cyclone, was very strongly marked before the Madras May cyclone. * * * The returns of wind velocity during the rainy season show that the lower air currents were less vigorous than usual in Bihar and Central Bengal.* * * The termination of the rains was followed by a more quiescent condition of the atmosphere than usual. Storms.-The sub-division of Tumlook was visited by two thunder- storms of a very severe character during the first week of February. A perfect hurricane, resembling a small cyclone, visited False Point and its neighbourhood on the 8th April. The Madras cyclone of 18th May, as has been already stated, extended to Bihar and Bengal on the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd, and was accompanied with stormy weather and heavy rainfall over the greater part of the province; the termination of the south-west monsoon was exceptionally free from stormy weather. Rainfall-The rainfall during the dry-weather months, January to May, was slightly in excess. Bihar and Orissa were the two districts in which the excess was relatively greatest. The rainfall in Bengal during January was very slightly above the average; February, was over the whole province
(134) marked by a much greater rainfall than usual. The rainfall of March differed very slightly from the average, except in Bihar and Orissa, where it was in excess. April was characterized by much heavier rainfall than usual. Thus, for example, Burisal, which has a mean fall of 2.79 inches, experienced 13.06 inches; Noakholly 5.25 instead of 3.88 inches. Orissa and the greater part of Bengal had more than average rainfall. The rainfall in Bihar differed very slightly from the average, and is always insignificant in amount at this time. The rainfall for the month of May was very considerably in excess, more especially in a narrow area extending from Patna to the western flank of the Jaintia Hills. The cylone which visited Madras and its neighbourhood on the 18th May advanced first of all along the coast and across Chota Nagpore, and diminished gradually in intensity until the 28th, when it again increased with the commencement of very heavy rainfall in Bengal and Bihar, and then advanced eastwards, finally dying away near the western flank of the Jaintia Hills. The rainfall in the Gya district averaged 9 inches for the month, and for the Patna district 6 inches. The normal rainfall in Bihar for the month is 1.3 inches. The rainfall in Rajshahi district and in Kuch Bihar was nearly double its usual amount. The rains commenced in the beginning of June along the coast and over Bengal, but advanced very slowly westwards up the Gangetic plain, extending to Bihar in the first week of July. They were abnormally heavy in Burmah and the adjacent British districts, including Eastern Bengal, and gave an average supply to the greater part of Bengal and portions of Bihar. The rain-supply was deficient in the districts of Kattak and Puri in Orissa, and in the districts of Shahabad, Sarun, Champaran, and Monghyr in Bihar. The monsoon rain current from its diversion to the east towards Burmah was very feeble during the rains, and failed to advance as far west as the North-Western Provinces. The rain-supply of that province was derived almost entirely from the current from the Arabian Sea advancing across central India. The rainy season of 1877 in Bengal was marked by a succession of feeble cyclonic disturbances which advanced from the mid Bay generally towards the east coast of the Bay. These cyclonic disturbances after reaching the coast were usually deflected to the west, they first gave heavy rain to the Arracan coast, and then a feebler supply to Bengal, and occasionally advanced as far west as Bihar. The rain- fall during the greater part of the rainy season occurred during the advance of these cyclonic disturbances, and the weather in the intervals between successive storms was usually fine, although cloudy and moist. The rainfall during June was very irregularly distributed. It was above the average in the Dhaka Division. Over the other divisions of Bengal it was slightly below the average, whilst over the greater part of Bihar it barely averaged one inch. The mean rainfall of Bihar is seven inches in June. The rainfall in Orissa was also below the average. The rainfall during the next month was abundant and fairly distributed. It was excessive in the Dhaka and Chittagong Divisions, over the greater portions of which it was nearly double its normal amount; in the other divisions of Bengal the rainfall was slightly above the average. It was irreg- ularly distributed in Bihar; the districts of Shahabad, Gya, and Mozufferpur suffered from a deficient supply. The rainfall in Orissa was in this, as in the remaining months, somewhat below the average. The general character of the rainfall distribution of August was very similar to July. The Dhaka and Chittagong Divisions continued to experience very heavy rainfall. Thus, at Chittagong, where the mean rainfall for the month is 21.89 inches, 41.35 inches were registered. The rainfall was over the average in the remaining divisions of Bengal, except in Rajshahi, and Kuch Bihar, where it was found much below the normal amount. It was deficient over the whole of Bihar, which received a mean fall of five inches instead of ten, the normal amount. The rains were very irregularly distributed during the month of September. The rainfall in Dhaka and Chittagong Divisions was slightly above the average. Rajshahi experienced a very heavy rainfall, which compensated for the deficient supply, more especially in the Shahabad, Sarun, and Champaran districts. The rainfall during October was above the average in Bihar. This was due to heavy rainfall which accompanied a cyclonic disturbance that began in the Bombay Coast and advanced east-
?(   135   ) wards to the North-Western Provinces during the second week of the month. The rainfall over the whole of Bengal was slightly below the average. The rains practically terminated in Kuch Bihar at the end of September, and about the 15th October over the remainder of the province. The amount of the rainfall was excessive in the districts of Eastern Bengal, * * * It was fairly up to the average and well distributed in Bengal and Chota Nagpore. In Bihar, the districts of Gya, Shahabad, Sarun, and Champaran suffered from a defective supply. Orissa also, during the whole of the rainy seasons, experienced a diminished rainfall. This was most marked along the coast of Puri.

The  mortality in January  and February is not usually higher than  that in November and December, but in 1877 it was very considerably so owing to severe epidemics of fever and cholera following  the  cyclone  of   October  1876,  continuing   operative   during  the earlier  months of  1877 in  considerable  portions  of the eastern districts of Bengal.    It is consequently difficult to determine to what extent the increased mortality was influenced by the climatic conditions of the period in the  areas so exceptionally affected, though in the districts not  affected  by the cyclone the increased  atmospheric   pressure  and  unusually   low   temperature    of January and February were coincident  with  a  slight increase in  the total number  of deaths   registered   during  these   months.     As regards  cholera mortality in its relation to the meteorology, it was severe from March to May when the atmospheric  pressure and the temperature were high;  the mortality declined from June to September when the moisture in the air was great, and the rainfall was constant and  abundant;  and   it  again became  very  severe from October when the rains ceased, and  during November and December, when the humidity of the air had decreased and evaporation had become very rapid.  In other words, cholera was widespread and severe when the atmospheric pressure was high, the humidity of the air least, and the rainfall at its minimum or almost absent;  and it declined  in prevalence when the  proportion of moisture in the air was great and the rainfall heavy. Food-supply.-On the whole the year 1877 was a year of average plenty. In the majority of the districts the outturn of the crops was more or less above, or equal to, the average yield. In 12 districts it was below average, and in 7, viz. Bakirganj, Mymensingh, Chittagong, Noakhalli, Naddia, Balasur, and Puri it was very bad. Although the harvest of the year was on the whole good, the prices of food- grains had risen very considerably as compared with the average prices of the three years which preceded 1877, excluding 1874, the famine year. This great rise in prices was partly due to drought having reduced the quantity of grain
(136) available, but chiefly to exportations to the famine districts in southern India and the North-Western Provinces. The rise was greatest during the third and fourth quarters of the year, particularly the last. No injurious effect on the general health was attributed in the local reports to the high prices of food, except in the districts of Murshidabad, Dhaka, Chittagong, Tipperah, Noakhalli, Kattak, and Puri, where the scarcity was severely felt, and the health of the people impaired from this cause. There can be little doubt, however, that in a country like Bengal, where large bodies of the people are in a chronic state of extreme poverty, but little above starvation point, any general rise in price must mean extreme suffering and a greatly diminished power of resisting disease, although with our imperfect registration, these results may not be apparent in the death-rate. The large exportation of food-grains would show that the yield was sufficient to meet this contingency as well as to provide for home consumption. In fact to the land-holding class, which is very large in Bengal, high prices and exportation are a boon, as they enable the people to dispose of their surplus stock at a profit, thus enhancing their material prosperity, and affording the means of paying off their debts. But on the mere day-labourers and the classes who have small fixed incomes, the dearth entails great hardship. The general rise in prices had no effect on the value of labour, either skilled or unskilled. It remained stationary in all the districts except Naddia, Murshidabad, Faridpur, Mymensingh, Tipperah, and Malda, where it was somewhat higher than in 1876; but the reports do not show that this rise was due to dearness of food.

?(140) BENGAL PROVINCE, 1878. The mortality registered from cholera among the civil population in this province in 1878 is shown in the annexed tabular statement. Of the total 95,192 deaths, 52,118 were of males and 43,074 of females. The ratio per mille of population is 1.58, and per cent. of all deaths regis- tered 8.94. During the year 1878 cholera visited every district, and was present in every month, as shown in the annexed statement. Compared with the results of the preceding year ;--Of the 673 registering circles it prevailed epidemically in 46 against 88 ; was severe in 67 against 103 ; mildly prevalent in 518 against 410, and entirely absent from 47 against 62 ; and it affected 18,821 villages against 23,041. The total deaths registered amounted to 95,192, or 1.58 per mille of the population under registration, against 155,305, or 2.58 per mille. Thus both the extent of prevalence and fatality of cholera in 1878 were mark- edly less than in 1877. There were, however, as in former years, special localities in which the ravages of the disease were severely felt, and the districts that suffered most are the following:- Districts.

(141) Total rainfall of the year, 6062 inches. The figures show great prevalence of cholera in January, very consid- erable decline in February, great increase in March, continuing up to May, with a maximum of prevalence in April; sudden decline in June, continued steady decline month by month to October, increase again in October, con- tinued with great prevalence in December. The great prevalence in January was a continuance of the preceding year's cold-weather epidemic, which, as usual, finally subsided in February. The rise for this year's cold-weather epidemic is not so great as in some former years, and commences later, due probably to the prolonged continuance of the rains. The year 1878 opened with a more or less severe prevalence of cholera in Bengal and Orissa. Within this area the disease continued to prevail with increasing virulence up to May in Bengal, and up to the end of the year with slight intermissions in February, October, and November in Orissa. In Darjiling and Jalpaiguri, its prevalence, however, commenced and also ended later, viz., from April to September. In Bengal the intensity was sub- dued generally from June to September, and the winter increase was from October to December. Chota Nagpur suffered severely only from March to August, and was comparatively free from the disease during the rest of the year. East Bihar, with the exception of Shahabad and Darbhanga, showed a marked immunity from the disease throughout the year. In the western districts of Bengal, as a whole, cholera prevailed more extensively and with greater fatality in 1878 than in the preceding year. The months of greater prevalence were January to April, and November and December. The disease was present in 2,072 villages against 1,711, and the mortality amounted to 129 against 88 per mille of population in 1877. But there were certain localities within this area in which the reverse was the case; thus, in Birbhum the mortality from cholera in 1878 stood at 186 against 242 per mille of population in 1877, and the area affected was covered by 4,659 villages against 5,885 in the preceding year. In Dinagepur cholera prevailed with great mildness in November and December, while it was very severe in the same months of the preceding year. This immunity is attributed to the heavier rainfall of 1878 and to the floods of the river Parnobaha. In Rajshahi there was exceedingly little cholera in 1878; and in Darjiling, while the town was entirely exempt from the disease, it prevailed with much severity in the Terai and spread as far as Kurseong which also suffered much. In Eastern Bengal there was a very great and sensible reduction of cholera in 1878, both in regard to its extent of prevalence and fatality; only 4,428 villages were affected against 7,828 in the preceding year, and the mortality fell to 1.18 against 6.63 per mille of population in 1877, the high mortality of which year was largely due to a continuance through its earlier months of the cholera epidemic which followed the cyclone inundation of October and November 1876. In this portion of Bengal it is an established fact that the months of greatest prevalence of cholera are January to May and November and December, the rainy months being those of greatest immunity. In Dhaka in 1878 cholera prevailed somewhat severely, and became general from the end of March to the end of April; the usual autumnal epidemic did not commence until December, and was very mild in character. This delay in its appearance was attributed to the heavy inundation which began in the end of July and continued to the end of September, when the rivers rose higher than they had ever been known to have done before. In Bihar the extent of country affected by, and the mortality from, cholera in 1878 were somewhat less, on the whole, than in 1877, the death- rate being 127 against 133 per mille of population, and the number of villages attacked 3,297 against 4,591. But this diminution was confined to the eastern district of the area, the fatality and extent of country covered by the disease being considerably greater in the western districts, excepting Malda in which district the monthly incidence of the disease is the same as in Bengal, whereas in the other districts of Western Bihar the months of greatest cholera prevalence are March to September. In Parnia cholera was epidemic in many parts of the district from March to May; the disease is
(142) said never to be absent from the banks of the Kusi and Kankai rivers. The district is generally low and interspersed with lagoons, swamps, and marshes. In Sonthal district cholera was present in epidemic form for the greater part of the year, and was more virulent than in 1877. In the Orissa districts cholera prevailed very severely in 1878, both the area covered by the disease and the mortality caused by it being greater than in the preceding year. The number of villages attacked was 3,678 against 2921 in 1877, and the death-rate 510 against 411 per mille of population. The prevalence of cholera in these districts has been generally attributed to importation by pilgrims, but in refutation of this notion the Magistrate of Kattak very pertinently remarks:-" The Ruth-jattra festival occurred this year on the 3rd July, and since 1873 it has never been earlier than the 23rd June. Pilgrims march down through Gya, Hazaribagh, Manbhum, Bankura, Midnapore, Balasur, and Kattak to Puri. There is therefore no reason for supposing that they would bring cholera into the district until their return after the ceremony, i.e., in July. Pilgrimage therefore cannot be the cause of cholera which rises to strength in May. Again, Jagatsingpur, which lies off either line of pilgrimage route, was the circle affected most last year. This year it it has been comparatively free. It is also noticeable that in this year, as in the last, there was a double wave of cholera, yet last year the heaviest mortality was in March and April sinking into insignificance in May, June, and July and rising again in August to culminate in September. But in 1878 the first wave did not gain its strength till May, and thereafter lessen- ing in June, it culminated for this year in July, falling very low in September (the highest month of the previous year), and then gaining strength again in November, it almost equalled the intensity of the ravages in July. Now last year the Ruth-jatra was only a few days earlier than in this year. It should be observed that the year 1878 has been one of peculiar rainfall and free from floods. This implies what actually occurred, a great lower- ing of the water-level below the soil. The wells in Kattak were pronounced never to have been so low for years. Frequent showers occurred during April and the early part of May, after which the rain totally ceased until the last week of June. Here then we find the mortality greatly increasing and not checked till the last week in June, when copious rain (7 inches) fell." In the districts of Chota Nagpur cholera prevailed more extensively and with greater fatality in 1878 than in the preceding year; 687 villages were affected against 105, and the death-rate was 106 against 09 per mille of population. The incidence of the cholera of 1878 among the troops and jail popu- lations in this province is shown in the subjoined abstract statements. Among the European troops, total average strength 2,835, there were altogether 3 admissions and 3 deaths from cholera, giving a death- rate of 106 per mille of strength. Of the 5 stations occupied by European troops the 2 following recorded cholera in 1878:- Fort William...   Strength 941 Admissions  2 Deaths 2 Dinapore   " 830   "     1 " 1 The strength of the affected troops is 1,771, the percentage of admissions to strength 0.17, and of deaths to admissions 100. Of the 3 admissions there were one in January, 1 in March, and 1 in July. Among the families of the European soldiers the following cholera was recorded in 1878:- Women, total average strength 245, admissions 2, deaths 1, viz., at Dum- Dum, strength 53, in April, 1 fatal case, and at Barrackpore, strength 32, in November, 1 case which recovered. Children, total average strength 519, admissions 3, deaths 1, viz., at Fort William, strength 177, in May 2 and in November 1. Among the native troops, total average strength 5,273, there were altogether 15 admissions and 9 deaths from cholera giving a death-rate of 1 71

Of the 15 admissions there were 1 in March, 2 in April, 4 in May, 2 in June, 1 in October, 2 in November, and 3 in December. Among the jail population-total average strength 18,350-there were altogether 409 admissions and 210 deaths from cholera, giving a death-rate of 11.44 per mille of strength.

Cholera in Bengal Province during the year 1879. Lithographed at the Survey of India Offices, Calcutta, January 1885.
(147) BENGAL PROVINCE, 1879. The monthly mortality registered from cholera among the civil population in 1879 is shown in the annexed tabular statement. Of the total 136,363 deaths, 76,000 were of males and 60,263 of females. The ratio per mille of population is 2.27, and per cent. of all deaths registered 14.34. The mortality registered in 1879 exceeded that of the preceding year by 41,171 deaths, the figures for the latter year being 95,192, or 1.58 per mille of population. As shown by the returns, the disease in 1879 visited every district, and was present during every month. Of the 673 circles, it prevailed epidemically in 87, against 46 in 1878; was severe in 98, against 67; mildly prevalent in 458, against 518; and entirely absent from 30, against 47; and it affected 23,663 villages, or 12.39 per cent. of the total number of villages in the province, against 18,121, or 9.75 per cent. in 1878. The urban circles returned 11,513 deaths, or 4.90 per mille of population, against 8,752, or 3.69 per mille in 1878; and the rural circles returned 124,850 deaths, or 216, against 86,440, or 1.49 per mille. The seasonal incidence of the disease in the four divisions of the province and in the province as a whole during 1879 are shown in the following diagrams and statements, together with the rainfall:- Cholera in Bengal Proper in 1879. U 2
(148) Cholera in Behar in 1879. Cholera in Orissa in 1879.
(149) Cholera in Chultia Nagpur in 1879. Cholera in the Bengal Province in 1879. Total rainfall of the year 6572 inches. There is little to be recorded regarding the deportment of cholera in 1879 which differs from what has been written in the review of previous years.
(150) It is, however, noticed that in a year of great prevalence of cholera, the large number of fairs held in the province were almost exempt from the disease. The local reports show that, excepting in Balasur and Puri towns, where, as usual, the pilgrims suffered severely from cholera and bowel complaints, the disease appeared only in the following fairs, viz. at Tarkesur fair in Hughli, 5 cases; at the Baruni fair in Dhaka, 3 cases; at Gawa Sagar fair in the 24-Parganahs, and at the Nekmard fair in Dinagepur, only a few cases. At some of the large fairs, where the gathering is great, and which lasts for any length of time, sanitary precautions against the outbreak of the disease are taken; but at many of such fairs, and as a rule at the smaller fairs, which last for a very short time, little or no care is taken. Regarding the seasonal prevalence of cholera in the Dhaka districts, the Civil Surgeon, Dr. Crombie, says that, " in this district there are great seasonal influences at work which overrule the local exciting causes of cholera, overpower them in the months of July, August, and September, allow them to reassert themselves in October, and induce them in their greatest inten- sity in December. In January they are less active than in December, and in February than in January. In March the seasonal causes are apparently sometimes more favourable, and in some years more opposed to local outbreaks than in February; but in April the rein is given again to them, to be followed by a check in May, and still more so in June, until they finally disappear in July. Referring to the seasonal prevalence of cholera in Dhaka in relation to the level of the subsoil water in the years 1877, 1878, and 1879, it appears, as Dr. Crombie writes, that in these years the April outbreak of cholera was accompanied by greater or less fluctuation of the subsoil water at its lowest level for the years. That in 1877, when the April outbreak was of greater intensity than in the two succeeding years, the mean level of the subsoil water was three feet higher than in 1878 and 1879. That in May, with a steadier level of the subsoil water, cholera diminishes, and with a rapid rise of the subsoil water-level in June, it disappears as an epidemic. That when the level is at its highest, and the surface of the country flooded and deluged with frequent rain from July to September inclusive, there is practically no cholera. That in October, the rains being over, a fall of 21/2 feet in the subsoil water-level was accompanied in 1877 by a fresh outbreak of cholera, numbering between 600 and 700 deaths, but in 1878 there was no such outbreak. That the rapid fall of the level from 71/2 to 15 feet in November and December 1877 was accompanied by about 3,300 deaths from cholera, while the scarcely less rapid fall during the same months of 1878 from 61/4 to 131/2 feet was accompanied by 1,100 deaths. That the steady fall of level in January and February in each of the three years was accompanied by a marked diminution of the number of cholera deaths. That in March 1879 there was an increase of cholera while the water level was still falling, while in the other years there was less cholera. There was, however, a slight fluctuation of the water level in February 1879, and if the dry season out- break can be attributed to such a fluctuation at low levels this may have affected the returns for March, there being often great delay in register- ing deaths in the district. * * * But, it is evident that the rapid fall of the level of the subsoil water in October, November, and December must be accompanied in a porous, sandy soil by a free emptying of the cess-pools into the adjoining wells; but the fall is just as rapid, and the interchange of contents probably just as free, in January, February, and March, the cess-pools having in the meantime received the cholera stools of the three previous months; and yet cholera is declining in these months. The incidence of the cholera of 1879 among the troops and jails in this province is shown in the subjoined abstract statements. Among the European troops-total average strength 2,253-there were altogether 1 admission and 1 death from cholera, giving a death-rate of 0.44 per mille of strength. Of the 5 stations occupied by European troops, the 1 following recorded cholera in 1879:-Fort William-strength 751- admissions 1, death 1, in July, giving a percentage of admissions to strength of 0.13.  Among the families of the European soldiers-total average strength, women 178, children 367-there was no cholera recorded in 1879.
(151) Among native troops-total average strength 4,128-there were altogether 5 admissions and 3 deaths from cholera, giving a death-rate of 0.73 per mille of strength. Of the 11 stations occupied by native troops, the 4 following recorded cholera in 1879:- Barrackpore  Strength  1,176 Admissions 1 Deaths 1 Dacca " 248 " 1 " 1 Baxa " 529 " 1 " 0 Dinapore  " 595 " 2 " 1 The strength of the affected troops is 2,548, the percentage of admissions to strength 020, and of deaths to admissions 60. Of the 5 admissions, there were 1 in March, 1 in April, 1 in July, 1 in August, and 1 in October. Among the jail populations-total average strength 18,317-there were altogether 682 admissions and 336 deaths from cholera, giving a death-rate of 1834 per mille of strength. Of the 47 jails in the province, the 36 follow- ing recorded cholera in 1879 :- Presidency  Strength 1,268 Admissions  23 Deaths  10 Alipore " 2,116 " 82  " 32 Russa " 244 " 2 " 0 Jessore " 322 " 2  " 0 Murshidabad " 244 " 1 " 1 Hugli " 501 " 24 " 13 Bardwan " 190 " 8 " 0 Bankura " 285 " 1 " 1 Purulia " 182 " 20 " 14 Suri " 194  " 3 " 3 Rajshahi " 872 " 102 " 49 Dinajpur " 151 " 24 " 9 Rungpur " 376 " 1 " 0 Bogra " 282 " 24 " 17 Mymensingh " 422 " 5 " 5 Faridpur " 359 " 4 " 1 Dacca " 632 " 3 " 2 Tipperah " 202 " 6 " 1 Bakirganj " 569 " 32 " 17 Chittagong " 252 " 1 " 0 Midnapur " 940 " 43 " 22 Balasur " 95 " 1 " 1 Cuttack " 268 " 6 " 5 Puri  " 89 " 3 " 3 Monghyr " 202 " 5 " 3 2 Bhagulpur, C. and D.

Of the 682 admissions there were 4 in January, 2 in February, 22 in March, 33 in April, 165 in May, 220 in June, 138 in July, 67 in August, 10 in September, 2 in November, and 19 in December. Of the 165 admissions in May all but one were in jails in Lower Bengal; of 220 in the June, 63 were in jails in Bihar, and the rest in Lower Bengal and Orissa (54); of the 138 in July, 82 were in jails in Bihar, and the rest in Lower Bengal and Orissa (23). Meteorology.-The following "brief review of the meteorological condi- tions of the year is abstracted from a note received from the Meteorological Reporter to Government." Atmospheric Pressure.-The variations in the distribution of atmospheric pressure during the year in Bengal were not very large in amount, but were
(152) nevertheless very clearly marked. The average pressure for the year was below the mean for all Bengal generally from the beginning of the year until the end of May. In April and in June it varied very slightly from the mean distribution; it was in excess over the whole province during July; in August it was very similar to that of June; and during the remainder of the year it was steadily below the average, the deficiency increasing until December. One effect of diminished pressure experience has shown to be to give a steady south-west monsoon current and favourable rains. Temperature.-The mean temperature for the year was slightly in excess of the average generally at all stations. It was steadily in excess during the first five months, except at Alipur and False Point where the defect was very great, particularly in January; more irregular and in excess in March; excessive in April, and less excessive in May. During the rains from June to the end of September, it was generally slightly in defect. In October it was again slightly in excess, but in November and December it was below the average; in the latter month considerably so. The increased temperature in April and May was mainly due to excessive temperature during the day. Rainfall.-The rainfall of the whole year was very considerably below the average (about 20 inches) in the whole of the Burdwan Division and over the greater part of the Presidency and Dacca Divisions, the deficiency varying greatly. On the other hand, it was very considerably in excess over the whole of Bihar and Northern Bengal, the excess averaging 825 inches. No rain fell at the great majority of stations in the month of January. The fall in Feb- ruary was moderate and most general over Bihar and Northern Bengal. March, like January, was a very dry month, except in Orissa and a few stations in Southern Bengal. The rainfall of April was irregularly distributed, and was generally deficient in amount, none having fallen in Bihar, Chota Nagpur, and Orissa, and occasional showers having occurred in Southern, Eastern, and Central Bengal, and moderate rain in the Rajshahi and Kuch Bihar Divisions of Bengal. The deficiency was very marked in Eastern Bengal and the Presi- dency Division. Moderate rain, generally in defect of average, occurred over the whole of Bengal and Orissa, and also over the greater part of Bihar, during May. The only districts which received little or none were Patna, Gya, and Shahabad. Excessive rainfall, however, occurred at Darjiling, Julpiguri, and Orissa. The rains set in early in June, but in consequence of the abnormal distribution of pressure the Bay of Bengal current was diverted more strongly than usual to Burmah and the Arracan Coast, and its influence in South-Western Bengal was consequently much less than usual. The Bombay Coast current was, however, unusually strong, and its influence prevailed as far westward as Chota Nagpur and Bihar, almost to the exclusion of the Bay of Bengal current. The rainfall of this month was generally in excess in Eastern and Northern Bengal, and over nearly the whole of Bihar. On the other hand, it was defective over the whole of the Burdwan Division, the 24-Parganahs, Orissa, and Chota Nagpur. The rainfall of the month of July was some- what more irregularly distributed than that of the preceding month, but the general character of the distribution was the same as in June. It was exces- sive generally in Northern and Eastern Bengal and over the whole of Bihar, and slightly in Chota Nagpur. It was, however, in defect over the whole of the Burdwan Division, in the 24-Parganahs mostly, and in Orissa. The rain- fall in August was more irregular than in July. It was in excess over the greater part of Eastern and Northern Bengal, but the excess was generally small in amount. It was also in excess over the whole of Northern Bihar, Purnia being the centre of the excess in this area. It was also slightly in excess (for the first time during the rains) in Orissa. But it was deficient over the whole of the Bardwan Division, the 24-Parganahs, Jaisur, and Murshidabad, and also over the greater part of Chota Nagpur. The deficiency was greatest in the Bardwan Division. The month of September was characterized by a stormy influx of aqueous vapour and by heavy rainfall over nearly the whole of Bengal and Bihar. The only districts in which the rainfall was below the average were Hugli and the greater part of the Dhaka and Chitta- gong Divisions. Northern Bengal and Bihar received exceptionally heavy local rainfalls, due in one or two cases to local storms. Several small storms occurred during the month near the head of the Bay. They advanced across
(153) the Orissa coast, where the rainfall was very heavy. The rainfall of October was considerably above the average in Eastern and Northern Bengal and over the whole of Bihar. The rains were prolonged beyond the usual date in Bihar. On the other hand, they were below the average in the Bardwan Division, the 24-Parganahs, Orissa, and Chota Nagpur. With the exception of one or two local showers, no rain fell during November. Moderate rain, generally slightly in excess of the average, fell in December over the whole of Bengal and Orissa and none fell in the greatest portion of Bihar. As compared with 1878, the rainfall was more abundant, the measured amount for 1879 being 65.72 inches, against 60.62 inches in the preceding year. Food-supply--The result of the generally abundant rainfall was a favour- able harvest of the staple articles of diet on which the people subsist. In 16 districts the harvest was above the average, and in 19 fair and equal to it. It was bad and below average in the following districts :-- Pabna, Puri, Naddia, Darjiling, Faridpur, Balasur, and Murshidabad, and in parts of Dhaka, Hughli, Serampur, Shahabad, Bogra, Champaran, Rajshahi, Patna, Bakirganj, Malda, Saran, Bhagalpur, Bankura, Bardwan, Parnia, Chittagong, and Midnapur. The average prices of the principal food-grains in seers and chittacks per rupee that were obtainable in the province in 1879 are shown in the subjoined tabular statement.-- PER RUPEE.  WHEAT.

In only a very few districts were the prices lower in 1879. At Howrah, the Northern Bengal State Railway has caused a large export trade in rice, and therefore the prices of the famine year 1874 were reached in a year of great prosperity. The Balasur port, which had of late years become crowded with shipping in October, was almost empty this year, owing to the demand for rice in Southern India having gone down. Like fluctuations attended the value of labour. In the agricultural districts a good crop was generally followed by a rise in the price of labour. * * * The general health of the people does not appear to have been in any way seriously affected by the dearness of food; but while cultivators, traders, artizans, and hired labourers were much benefited, the high prices proved a great hardship to the poor consumers, the non-cultivators, and those whose incomes are limited. This was specially the case in Kattak, Bhagalpur, Puri, Faridpur, in some places in Jaisur, * * * Dhaka, * * * and Naddia. * * * In these localities the people suffered chiefly from fevers and bowel complaints. x

Cholera in Bengal Province during the year 1880. Lithographed at the Survey of India Offices, Calcutta, January 1885.
(157) BENGAL PROVINCE, 1880. The monthly mortality registered from cholera among the civil population is shown in the annexed tabular statement. Of the total 39,643 deaths, 21,901 were males, and 17,742 females; the ratio per mille of population is 066, and per cent. of all deaths registered 430. The returns show a very marked decrease in the prevalence of cholera in 1880 as compared with the total mortality from the disease registered in the preceding year, for which the figures are 136,363, the decrease being 96,720 deaths. As shown in the statement, the cholera of 1880 visited every district in the province, and was present in every month of the year. The disease prevailed epidemically in only 19 circles, against 87 in the preceding year; was severe in only 45, against 98; was mildly prevalent in 493, against 458; and was entirely absent from 118, against 30. It affected 9,447 villages, or 502 per cent. of the total number of villages in the province, against 23,663, or 1239 per cent. in 1879. The mortality registered in the urban circles as a whole amounted to 3,253 deaths, or 137 per mille of population, against 11,513, or 490 per mille in 1879. For the rural circles the figures are 36,390, or 63 per mille, against 124,850, or 216 per mille respectively. Contrary to the experience of 1879, both the urban and rural circles suffered to a considerably lesser extent, the preponderance in the rate of abatement being observable in the urban circles. Thus, both in extent of prevalence and fatality the disease exhibited very considerable abatement as compared with 1879 or any of the preceding years, back to 1875, from which year death registration may be said to have made great improvement, as is shown in the subjoined tabular statement:-   CIRCLES OF REGISTRATION.

The seasonal incidence of the cholera of 1880 is shown in the following diagrams and statements separately for each of the four divisions of the province and for the province as a whole, together with the rainfall of each month:- Cholera in Bengal proper in 1880.
(158) Cholera in Bihar in 1880. Cholera in Orissa in 1880. Cholera in Chota Nagpore in 1880.
(159) Cholera in the Bengal Province in 1880. The total rainfall for the year is 7214 inches. These diagrams and statements show that the seasons of greatest and least prevalence of cholera in 1880 corresponded very nearly with its seasonal distribution in the five years from 1875 to 1879 inclusive, in Bengal Proper, Bihar, and Chota Nagpur, but not in Orissa, where the uniformity is marred by marked differences, which are probably attributable to the presence or absence of pilgrims in this division of the province. In 1880 cholera affected less than half the area that was affected by the disease in 1879, and it pre- vailed on the whole more extensively during the first half of the year than during the second half, in which latter the abatement is most marked, whilst the usual autumnal exacerbation of the disease commenced a month later than is ordinarily the case, viz. in November instead of in October. Excluding local epidemic outbreaks of cholera, the general incidence of the disease in the province as a whole during 1880 may be thus summed up. In Bengal Proper.-The declining epidemic of 1879 was continued into the earlier part of 1880 in its eastern, southern, and western districts, with the exception only of Noakhalli, and in the area covered by them cholera continued to prevail with more or less severity up to June, after which month the disease gradually subsided, and its autumnal revival was promi- nently marked only in the southern districts of central Bengal, its prevalence in the remaining districts being mild. In Bihar, contrary to the experience of 1879, there was very little cholera in severe form, Champaran, Muzaffar- pur, and Shahabad, where it prevailed from March to June, being the only districts that show this tendency. In Orissa, as in the preceding year, cholera prevailed in very severe form almost throughout the year in all the three districts of the division. In Chota Nagpur, which suffered epidemically in 1879, there was a marked immunity from cholera in 1880, the only district in which the disease was severe being Singbhum, where it prevailed during February to May. In connection with the influence of rainfall on the prevalence and fatality of cholera, it is to be observed that in 1880 the rainfall of the year (7214 inches) was not only excessive, but was also considerably larger in amount than that of 1879 (6572 inches), as well as that which represents the average of several preceding years (6498 inches), and further, that with this excessive rainfall a correspondingly great abatement of cholera prevalence and mortality has taken place as compared not only with 1879, but also
(160) with any year since 1875, taking the latter year as the turning point in the better registration of deaths. In Bengal Proper and Orissa, as has always been the case, cholera was least prevalent in those months in which the least amount of rain fell. In Behar and Chota Nagpur, on the other hand, the contrary was the case, in these more elevated portions of the province the prevalence of cholera was greatest in those months in which the rain- fall was heaviest, and least in those months in which the rainfall was lightest. In other words, in the low lands of the province the season of cholera preval- ence is the dry, rainless weather, and in the high lands the season is the wet, rainy weather, and vice vers. It is noteworthy that at the greatest majority of fairs no outbreaks of disease occurred. The exceptions are the following:-At the two fairs held at Tarkesar in Hugli, there were 19 cases of cholera with nine deaths; in the March fair, lasting two days, the gathering of people was about 15,000, and in the April fair, lasting 5 days, about 40,000 people. At the Gunga Sagar fair, in the 24-Pergunnahs, held in January, and lasting a week, only 5 cases of cholera occurred among an assemblage of about 84,000 people. At the Kuri fair, held in April on the east bank of the Ganges, in Malda, which lasted 8 days, and where about 70,000 people were assembled, two or three persons were attacked with cholera, but they recovered. At the Baron fair in Dacca, held on the 16th November, which lasted six weeks; and where about 40,769 people and 31,770 boats were collected, only three cases of cholera occurred, which ended fatally. At the Adapur fair, held in April at Champarun, which lasted 12 days, and where about 5,000 people were assem- bled, there occurred an outbreak of cholera, of which no particulars were furnished. On the other hand, at the Baklipur fair in Birbhum, which lasted 8 days, and was attended by 30,000 people, no cholera occurred, although it was very prevalent at the time in villages close by. Regarding the prevalence of cholera in the Puri district, it is stated that the disease existed in the Puri town and district in the beginning of the year and prevailed in one part or another of Puri throughout the year with increased intensity as compared with 1879, and that it exhibited increased vigour at three different times, which corresponded with the influx of pilgrims into the district, as has been the case for years, viz. in February and March, when pilgrims come for the Doljatra festival, which took place on the 26th March; again in July for the Rathjatra, which took place on the 9th of that month; and a third, from September to November, in the latter month the great car festival being held for a fortnight. It is mentioned also that at other large fairs in this district, held during the period above mentioned, there was no cholera, viz. at the Chandra Bhoja fair, held at Gop in April, where 40,000 people were assembled; at the Ultia Amabosya fair, held in Puri itself in July, when 15,000 people were assembled; and at the Panchak fair, held also in Puri from the 13th to 17th November, and at which 10,000 people had assembled. Regarding the cholera of 1880 in the Hazaribagh district, it is stated that the only serious outbreaks were those that occurred in the Garwan circle, which is situated in the north-east corner of the district. Projecting between Monghyr and Gya, it lies low, is fertile, and well cultivated, and traversed by the river Sakri, along the left bank of which the pilgrim route from Gya runs. The first outbreak occurred in March, and lasted till June; the second occurred in October; and both outbreaks were strictly limited to this circle. The first case occurred on the 2nd March in the person of a pilgrim coming from Gya, on the road between the villages of Basodi and Simaldi in the Garwan circle. After this two persons belonging to these villages were attacked. By the 14th March a good number of cases occurred in both villages. By the 16th the disease spread to the large but filthy village of Garwan, situated on the pilgrim road to the south of the villages in which it first appeared. The first case in Garwan occurred in a woman who had not left the village for some time previously. * * * From the 30th March the disease spread further, subsid- ing in some villages and attacking others. Towards the end of May it declined to a great extent, and disappeared finally by the 17th June, having lasted a little over three months. In all 387 persons were reported to have been attacked and 264 to have died during this outbreak, the following
(   161   ) villages showing very large proportions of population attacked and deaths to cases:- Villages.                           Population. Cases. Deaths. Bhakra                                 100    56        33 Basodi  300    92        61 Pokhardiha  150    32        25 Chandi   70    18        13 In the annual statement the total deaths appearing for the months of March to June inclusive is only 173, or 91 less than the number above mentioned, and only 41 more than the total mortality in the above four villages, thus disclosing a very great defect in registration. In the last week of May 37 inches of rain fell, and in the first week of June 5 inches. This corresponds with the time, as before stated, of the subsidence and final disappearance of the disease. With reference to the  prevalence of cholera generally in this district, the Civil Surgeon says that " he has often observed that in those years in which there is a deficient rainfall in the early part of the rains the disease spreads to the highlands of the district, but that when the rains are plentiful this extension is prevented, and that, dividing the districts into two parts, high and low lands, the former being about 1,800 to 2,000 feet, and the latter about 600 feet above the level of the sea, the periods of cholera prevalence in them differ. In the high lands cholera does not spread until the rains have well set in, while the contrary is the case in the low lands, as here cholera generally occurs in March, April, May, and the beginning of June, as at the Garwan outbreak, and that the extension of the disease from the lower to the higher levels depends very much on the quantity of rain which falls in the end of the hot weather and the earlier part of the rains. If it is copious, the extension appears to be prevented." The incidence of the cholera of 1880 among the troops and jail population in this province is shown in the subjoined abstract statements. Among the European troops-total average strength 2,625-there were altogether 2 admissions and 1 death from cholera, giving a death-rate of 038 per mille of strength. Of the 5 stations occupied by the European troops, the 1 following recorded cholera in 1880:-viz.,Dinapore-strength 906 in May-giving a percentage of admissions to strength of 022, and of deaths to admissions 50. Among the families of the European soldiers-total average strength, women 142, children 281-there was no cholera recorded in 1880. Among the native troops-total average strength 3,445-there were altogether 4 admissions and 3 deaths from cholera, giving a death-rate of 087 per mille of strength. Of the 9 stations occupied by the native troops, the 3 following recorded cholera in 1880:- Barrackpore Strength         1,202 Admissions     1 Deaths        0 Dinapore             "        583 "             1 " 1 Sigaoli "                       323 "             2 " 2 The strength of the affected troops is 2,108, the percentage of admissions to strength 020, and of deaths to admissions 75. Of the 4 admissions, there were 3 in April and 1 in May. Among the jail populations-total average strength 17,687-there were altogether 53 admissions and 29 deaths from cholera, giving a death-rate of 164 per mille of strength. Of the 47 jails in the province, the 17 following recorded cholera in 1880 :- Presidency Strength        1,189 Admissions              3   Deaths 2 Alipore ? 1,996 ? 2 ? 0 Jessore ? 346 ? 5 ? 4 Murshidabad     ? 277 ? 7 ? 5 Hugli ? 523 ? 2 ? 1 Bardwan ? 159 ? 1 ? 1 Rajshahi ? 176 ? 1 ? 0 Dacca ? 631 ? 3 ? 1 Tipperah ? 191 ? 11 ? 6 Bakirganj ? 427 ? 2 ? 0 Y

Of the 53 admissions there were 15 in January, 5 in February, 2 in March, 13 in April, 3 in May, 3 in June, 2 in July, 4 in August, 3 in November, and 3 in December. The prevalence of cholera in the jails of Bengal Province during 1880 is very considerably below that of any year of the whole series back to 1862, and the mortality is not much more than half that of 1871, which is the year of next lowest prevalence in the same series of years, comparing the general characteristics of these two years. Meteorology.-The following brief review of the meteorological conditions of the year 1880 is condensed from a note received from the Meteorological  Reporter to Government. Atmospheric pressure.-The variations of the barometer during the year 1880 were larger than usual. Pressure was considerably below the average at all the Bengal stations in the month of January, and the defect appeared to have been confined to the lower strata of the atmosphere, as the average pres- sure at Darjiling for the month only varied 507 from the average for the month. Pressure in February differed very slightly from the normal average, but during the next month it was considerably below it. This large defect in the pressure, unlike the similar feature in the month of January, appeared not to have been confined to the lower atmospheric strata. The same feature of deficient air pressure was continued at the plain stations during April. The relative distribution of pressure was, however, considerably altered, the defi- ciency of pressure being, as in the month of January, confined almost entirely to the lower strata of the atmosphere, i.e., below 6,000 feet. The general oscillatory character of the variation of the pressure (combined with general deficiency of pressure) was again shown in May. The averages for this month show that the pressure generally differed by small amounts from the normal mean. Pressure diminished very rapidly during the next month of June, and was generally largely in defect. The deficiency of pressure in June was follow- ed by a rebound in July, when the pressure was slightly in excess almost everywhere. The chief feature of the first six months of the year was, it will be seen, diminished pressure, and this feature continued up to the setting in of the rains, and was strongly marked at that time, viz. in the month of June. With the commencement of a stronger south-west monsoon current than usual the variations of pressure altered in character, as during the remaining months of the year it was in excess over the whole of the province, except in Orissa in September. In July and August the variations in excess were generally small in amount, but they increased in September and October, and were more marked in November, but much less so in December. Mean Temperature.-The average temperature of the month of January was generally in excess of the normal mean. In Central and Northern Bengal it ranged from 1 to 2 above the average, but was less in Behar and Chota Nagpur, barely amounting to -1/2. In February the temperature was consider- ably below the average. The deficiency was greatest in Bihar and Western Bengal, where it amounted to 2,-over Eastern and Northern Bengal it varied from 1/2 to 11/2. February was only very slightly warmer than January over almost the whole of the province. The temperature in March was lower than the average. It was slightly (from 1/2 to 11/2) in excess in Bihar, Chota Nag- pur, and Western Bengal, and in defect by small amounts, averaging 1/2 in Eastern Bengal. The most rapid increase of temperature always occurs in March in Bengal and in April in Bihar. The temperature for April was in excess over the whole province, as compared with the preceding month, more especially in Bihar and Chota Nagpur, where it averaged 21/2 above the normal mean,-the excess in Eastern and Central Bengal was much less, barely amounting to 1. May was characterized by unusually low temperature, the averages for the Bengal stations being generally less than for the previous
(163) month. The deficiency was greatest in Chota Nagpur and Central Bengal. This reduction of temperature was due to a succession of thunderstorms and nor'westers. During the next month the rains set in slightly earlier than usual. The effect of this, combined with the low temperature of the month of May, was to diminish the temperature of June considerably below the average. The deficiency averaged from 1 to 2, and was great in Northern Bihar and Bengal. During the next three months, July, August, and September, the temperature variations were small, and dependent mainly upon the distribution of rainfall, and are unimportant in character. It was in defect in nearly all stations during each of these months, but the deficiency never exceeded generally 1. During October the temperature was slightly above the normal mean, the excess averaging 1 in Bihar and Northern Bengal, and slightly in Southern Bengal. The temperature of the two remain- ing months was unusually low, more especially in November. The deficiency in November ranged from 1/2 to 2, and was greatest in Bihar, Chota Nagpur, and Western Bengal. In Northern and Central Bengal it ranged from 1 to 21/2. The year on the whole was thus characterized by diminished temperature. The month of January was warmer than usual, but was followed by an unusually cool February. April, the month of maximum temperature, was unusually hot. The atmospheric disturbances produced by the great heat of April gave a succession of local storms, which cooled the atmosphere in May. The rains were generally abundant, and lasted until the middle of October, and were followed by two months of unusually cool weather." Rainfall.-The rainfall of the month of January was unusually small. Light showers fell during the first and last weeks of the month, and the deficiency averaged about 1/2 inch in Bihar, Chota Nagpur, South-Western Bengal, and Orissa. The rainfall was slightly in excess in Northern Bengal and the Darjiling Hills. The first week of February was a dry one, local showers occurred during the second week, general rain fell over the whole province from the 15th to 18th, and occasional showers during the last week of the month. The total rainfall of the month was considerably above the average, the excess amounting nearly to 2 inches for the whole province. March was almost a rainless month in Western Bengal, Bihar, Chota Nagpur, and Orissa, light local showers occurring during the last week of the month. The rainfall for the month over the whole of these districts was thus below the average by amounts varying from 1/2 inch to 11/2 inches, and averaging about 3/4 of an inch for this area. In Northern and Eastern Bengal abundant showers fell during the third and fourth weeks, which caused an excess in the total rainfall of the month as compared with the average. April was a hot and dry month. It was almost rainless in Bihar and Chota Nagpur; showers fell in Orissa and Western Bengal between the 15th and 18th; and Eastern and Northern Bengal received local showers during the whole month. The total rainfall of the month was thus in defect over the whole province, excepting in the Darjiling and Kuch Bihar districts, where it was very slightly in excess. The defect varied considerably, being greatest in Eastern Bengal, where the rainfall of April is generally considerable, and smallest in Bihar, where it is small. The defect in Bihar only averaged about 4 inches. May, unlike April, was a month of frequent storms and showers. General rain fell over the whole province on the 4th, 5th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 15th, 16th, 24th, and 25th. It fell apparently in heavy local showers, and hence its distribution was very irre- gular. The total rainfall in this month was in excess nearly all over the province. The excess averaged one inch in Eastern and Northern Bengal, 2 inches in Western Bengal and Orissa, and 1/2 an inch in Bihar and Chota Nagpur. The rains set in in the beginning of June, slightly before their normal date of arrival, and general rain fell over the province from the 1st to 4th. Thus rainfall was small in amount in Bihar only. Elsewhere it was general and moderately heavy. General rainfall again occurred from the 13th to the 16th. A short break, well marked in Western Bengal, Orissa, and Bihar followed until the 20th, after which rain fell at frequent intervals during the remainder of the month. The main body of the rain at this time fell in Southern, Eastern, and Northern Bengal, and in Orissa, over the whole of which area the total rainfall of the month was in excess. In Bihar and Chota Nagpur it was slightly Y 2
(164) below the average. The excess in Southern Bengal averaged 3 inches, in Eastern and Northern Bengal it varied considerably, but averaged about four inches in excess, whilst it was in defect from one to three inches in Bihar and Chota Nagpur. At this period the main body of the monsoon current was, although a strong one, apparently partially diverted to Eastern and Northern Bengal, which consequently received excessive rainfall, while the local storms, which always form at frequent intervals during the prevalence of the south- west monsoon, marched at this time from the head of the Bay towards the area of presistent low pressure in Orissa. This area consequently received also at this time very heavy rainfall. The rainfall in July was well distributed throughout the whole month. The current from the Bay was weak during this month, and the rainfall over the whole area directly dependent on it only was slightly below the average. Thus in Southern Bengal the total rainfall for the month averaged about two inches in defect. In Eastern and Northern Bengal the defect was greater, more especially in the Dhaka and Chittagong Divisions, where it averaged at least four inches in defect. It was some- what in excess in Orissa, owing to the occurrence of local storms, formed in and crossing from the head of the Bay. The Bombay coast monsoon current was, however, unusually strong, and prevailed in force across the Peninsula to the foot of the hills in Bihar, and gave it excessive rain and heavy floods. The rainfall over this area was about six inches in excess of the normal amount. Rain was again well distributed during the month of August. The only marked break which occurred was in Bihar and Chota Nagpur, which lasted from the 15th to the 21st. The total rainfall for the month was everywhere in excess, with a few local exceptions. The rainfall over the coast area in the north-west angle of the Bay (i.e., in the Orissa and Balasur districts) was also excessive, due to the passage of a series of north-west monsoon storms across it. The rains were generally less steady and abundant in September. A general break in the rains occurred between the 16th and 21st, and another from the 25th to the end of the month, except in Eastern Bengal. The rainfall was very generally in defect. In Western Bengal it was about two inches below the average, in Bihar about four inches, and in Northern Bengal from five to ten inches. Moderate rain occurred during the first fortnight of October, and the rains proper may be said to have terminated on the 19th of this month. Slight occasional showers fell until the 3rd or 4th of November. The rains thus lasted longer than usual, and the rainfall for the month of October was generally above the average. In Bengal the excess averaged about two inches, and was greatest in Northern Bengal and in the Dhaka district. In Bihar it averaged about one inch, and in Orissa from two to three inches in excess. The rainfall of November was generally small in amount, and slightly in defect over the whole province, except Northern Bihar and Orissa, where rain fell from the 1st to the 7th of the month. The rainfall of December was also generally small in amount, and was not general over the province. Light showers fell in Bihar, Eastern and Northern Bengal from the 12th to the 15th, and in Western Bengal and Orissa on the 18th. In Eastern and Northern Bengal the rainfall was slightly in excess, about half an inch in amount. In Western Bengal and Bihar it was, on the other hand, below the mean for the month by amounts averaging 2 inch. The rains of 1880 were unusually abundant. They moreover commenced early (on the 1st June), were well distributed over the whole south-west monsoon period, and terminated later than usual. The excess of the total rainfall of 1880 above the average of previous years, calculated for the various parts of the province, were- Bengal    ...  ... +788 Orissa      ...     ... +1669 Bihar      ...  ...  +234 Chota Nagpur          ...   + 864 Food-supply.-The natural consequence of the unusually abundant and well distributed rainfall was a most favourable one for harvest on the whole. Almost throughout the province the outturn was above average, in some districts very considerably so, in only the district of Champaran was it below average, there were partial failures in six other districts, but they did not affect the food-supply of the people. This excellent outturn, a general cessation of exports to neighbouring districts or elsewhere, and to some extent of monopolies in the
(165) grain trade, &c., caused a fall in the prices of food-grains everywhere except in the districts of Champaran, Hughli, and Shahabad. The subjoined tabular statement shows the average quantities in seers and chittacks of wheat, common rice, and pulses that were obtainable for a rupee- MEAN FOR THE- WHEAT.     RICE.

The value of labour was reported not to have been affected by this agricul- tural prosperity in the majority of districts, while in some it was lower, but it was higher in Bakirganj, Darbhanga, Chittagong, Noakhalli, and Shahabad. Under the above mentioned circumstances, the general health of the people had not been adversely affected.
