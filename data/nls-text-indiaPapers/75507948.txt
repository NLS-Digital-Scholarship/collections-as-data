No. 147ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT IN INDIA FOR THE OFFICIAL YEAR 1900-1901. CONTENTS. PART I.ii PAGES. III.GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT IN INDIA FOR THE OFFICIAL YEAR 1900-1901. PART I.-IMPERIAL REPORT. I.-HORSE BREEDING. Number of stallions on the Register. A reference to Table I will show that at the beginning of the year under report there were 373 horse stallions present; 47 were added to the Register and 63 removed, leaving a balance of 357 on the 31st March 1901. 2. The strength of pony stallions in the Bombay Presidency was 17, the same as last year. 3. Table II will show that of the 357 horse stallions present at the close of the year, 170 were up to 10 years of age, 160 over 10 and up to 15 years, and 27 over 15 years old. Number of stallions at work. 4. Table V will show that of 357 horses on the Register, 291 were actually employed at stud work; of the remainder 47 were unacclimatized horses and 19 ineffective from sickness or other causes. Cost of feed and keep. 5. The general average annual cost per horse, including feed, keep, attend- ants, gear and clothing, etc., amounted to R366-1-10 (vide Table IX) against R347-8-4 in the previous year, showing an increase of only R18-9-6 per annum, which, considering the high rates which prevailed for grain, and the excessive fodder famine which existed during the year, must be considered satisfactory. Number and classes of stallions imported and purchased. 6. The number of stallions received during the year, either by importation or by purchase in India, was as noted below:2 8. The average cost of the eight stallions imported from England amounts to £274 each, but this represents the price actually paid, and does not include expenses in England or other incidental charges connected with transit, etc. Short note on each class of stallion imported. 9. No note has been left by my predecessor as to his opinion on the class of horse imported during last year, but a Committee composed of the following officers, viz., Veterinary Major Ringe, Veterinary Captain Maxwell, Veterinary Lieutenant Trydell and Veterinary Lieutenant Smith, was ordered by him to assemble at Babugarh. I attach the remarks of this Committee and refrain from making any comments as I have not seen the horses in question. 10. The two thoroughbred English, viz., "The Swale" and "Master Lurgan," sent to the Bombay Presidency, were seen by me. They are both small, compact horses on short legs and fair movers. They are suitable for the Deccan but not up to the standard of former years. 11. The Committee's remarks on the horses sent to Babugarh, are as follows:3 may be accounted for by the fact of the branded mares in the Bombay Presi- dency not having been shown in the returns furnished. 17. The number of mares branded during the year has been reduced from 2,057 in 1899-1900 to 1,869 during the year under report. There can be no doubt that scarcity of fodder was the chief reason for this decrease, several hundreds of mares having been removed to other districts where fodder was obtainable. Number of mares covered by stallions. 18. A reference to Table V will show that 14,000 mares were covered by horse-stallions, against 14,100 last year, showing a reduction of only 100 mares, which, considering the bad year, must be accepted as satisfactory. Average coverings per stallion employed. Demand for stallions. 19. The average number of mares covered per stallion employed, is almost. the same as last year, being 48.10 against 48.12 in 1899-1900. 20. The Superintendents of the following districts, viz., North-Western Provinces and Oudh, North and South Punjab and Baluchistan and Sind, state that there is a constant demand for stallions, but only of the following classes, viz., Thoroughbreds and Arabs. 21. Every endeavour will be made by me to eliminate all Norfolk Trotters and Hackneys within the next year or two, and I trust that by so doing a contin- uity of policy will be established, which, in course of time, will lead to the forma- tion of a fixed type4 28. The prices paid for imported horse and donkey stallions during the year under review are as shown below:- R a. p. Price of 8 horses imported from England £2,195-10-0 at 1s. 4d. per rupee . . . . . . 32,932 8 0 £ s. d. Price of 12 Catalonian donkeys at £50 each . 600 0 0 Price of 10 Italian donkeys at £50 each . 500 0 0 Price of 34 Cyprian donkeys at £27 each . 918 0 0 2,018 0 0 at 1s. 4d. per rupee . . . 30,270 0 0 TOTAL . 63,202 8 0 against R62,044 in 1899-1900, showing an increase of R1,158-8-0. This is due to a larger number of donkey stallions having been imported than in the previous year. Maps. 29. As usual, maps will be found in the cover of this Report, showing the breeding districts, the stands where stallions are located, and the number of stallions at each stand. II.-MULE BREEDING. Number of donkey stallions on the Register. 30. A reference to Table I will show that whilst 439 donkey stallions were on the Register at the beginning of the year, 460 were present at its close, of which 296 were up to 10 years of age, (vide Table II), 118 over 10 and up to 15 years, and the remaining 46 were over 15 years old. Number of donkey stallions at work. 31. Table VII will show that 378 donkey stallions were employed against 347 in the previous year. If we exclude the 61 donkeys received during the year under report, which were unacclimatized, we find that 21 donkeys were ineffec- tive from sickness and other temporary causes. Cost of feed and keep. 32. The cost of feed and keep of donkey stallions, as shown in Table XII, amounts to R183-4-3, against R179-13-0 in the previous year. The nominal increase of R3-7-3 per donkey, per annum, is not worthy of comment. Number and classes of donkey stallions received. 33. The number of donkey stallions received during the year, either by importation or purchase, was as follows:5 Casualties during the year. 36. As will be seen by a reference to Table III, 15 donkeys died during the year and 22 were destroyed; giving a percentage of 3.41 of deaths and 5.01 of those destroyed. Sales. 37. Two donkeys were sold during the year under report, owing to their refusing to cover pony mares or being otherwise unfit as sires. Supply of donkey stallions. 38. The supply of donkey stallions from the Continent is steadily decreas- ing and the class of animal imported last season, considerably below the average of former years. 39. Indents for 19 stalians, 28 Cyprians and 10 Catalonians were sent in, but out of this number only 10 Italians, 34 Cyprians and 12 Catalonians have been received. Thirty Italians for donkey breeding in the Punjab were also asked for, but only 15 have been received. They are a very small and in- different lot. 40. Out of the 30 Arabs, Persians and country-breds indented for, it was only possible to obtain 5 country-breds which are too young to use at present. 41. A new field has been opened up in China and 3 donkeys received from there during the season. Arrangements have been made to further tap this market and I have great hopes that we shall be able, to obtain a certain number annually. 42. I see no reason why good Jacks should not be bred in this country, providing due care is given the dam and the young stock are reared under favourable conditions. I have already taken steps to procure mares for this purpose and intend giving the experiment a fair trial. Improvement in the breed of donkeys. 43. In answer to a Circular from this Office, replies were received from the Director of Land Records and Agriculture, and also from all Deputy Commis- sioners in the Punjab, with the exception of the important districts of Shahpur and Ferozepore, and the following scheme was elaborated. 44. It was decided that 50 donkey stallions should be purchased, to be used exclusively for donkey breeding in the Punjab; and that the initial cost should be borne by the Imperial Government. 45. It was also arranged that the 50 donkey stallions should be distributed as follows:6 Young mules reared at Hissar Farm. 48. I have inspected the young mules at Hissar to which mention was made in the report last year. Some few are small and it is somewhat prema- ture to make any definite forecast as to what class the majority will eventually develop into. Number of mares covered by donkey stallions. 49. The increase in the number of pony and donkey mares covered by donkey stallions during the year under report, is very satisfactory. Table VII will show that 20,092 pony mares and 1,665 donkey mares were served, against 19,444 and 1,489, respectively, in 1899-1900. Average coverings per stallion employed. 50. The average number covered per stallion employed is, however, slightly less than in the previous year owing to a larger number of donkey stallions being employed at work. The averages are as follows:V BALUCHISTAN. 60. Two Horse Shows were held in Baluchistan, the same as last year. The number of animals competing for prizes was 1,279 against 1,186 last year. The number of Remounts obtained by the Remount Department, Native Cavalry, and Police, was 113 against 205 in the former year. No mules are recorded as sold. SIND. 61. Three Horse Shows were held, and the number of competitors was 1,217 against 1,356 last year. 163 Remounts, in all, were purchased, against 96 in the previous year. The sale of 14 mules is also recorded, against 15 secured by Government last year. BENGAL. 62. No particulars have been furnished of the Fairs held in the Bengal Presidency. BOMBAY. 63. Owing to the prevalence of famine, only one Show (the one at Ahmad- nagar) was held. There were 432 head of horse stock competing for prizes, and 9 Remounts were secured for Government and the Police. Special Judging Committees. 64. As usual Special Judging Committees were appointed for the Punjab and North-Western Provinces. The former was composed of the following officers:8 IV.-INSTRUCTION FARM. North-Western Provinces. 69. Tables XV to XVII may be referred to. Of 14 mares employed on the Farm, 4 colts, 3 fillies, and 1 mule were dropped during the year. One mare and 2 colts died, and 1 stallion was destroyed. Seven Arab pony stallions were sold to District Boards, and two to the Provincial Government. Four colts, and 1 mule were sold to the Army Remount Department and 1 to the 3rd Bengal Cavalry. 70. Considering the bad season for crops, cultivation operations were satis- factory, resulting in a saving of R233-13-8 over the year's outlay. Punjab. 71. Of 10 mares served by horse stallions, 1 colt and 4 fillies were produced. There were no casualties among the Farm animals. Three Arab pony stallions were sold to District Boards. The Balance sheet of cultivation operations shows a loss of R651-14-3. This, however, is accounted for by the fact of the sum of R12,000 paid for land purchased at the Abbottabad (Mirpur) Depôt stables for cultivation purposes having been debited to the Farm. GOVERNMENT CATTLE FARM, HISSAR. 72. A detailed report on the working of the Government Cattle Farm at Hissar, for the year 1900-1901, has already been submitted to the Government of India, Department of Revenue and Agriculture, under cover of this Office letter No. 68-195 R. and A., dated 14th May 1901. 73. The financial results of the year's work may be summarised as follows:9 78. The Imperial Bacteriologist and his staff were chiefly occupied during the past 12 months in the manufacture and testing of Rinderpest serum. 64,462 doses were manufactured and 24,232 distributed to the various Superin- tendents. It is satisfactory to note that more machinery has been purchased, and there is every hope that the output will be considerably larger next year. 79. It is to be regretted that further experiments were not made to ascertain the doses of anti rinderpest serum required to protect the different breeds, and it is to be hoped that progress will be made during the coming year on this point. 80. Two Veterinary Assistants were trained during the year: but other ar- rangements must be made to considerably increase the output otherwise inocu- lations will make little or no progress. VI.-EQUINE DISEASES. Glanders and Farcy. 81. Reports of the existence of Glanders and Farcy have been received from Bengal and Bombay, and of isolated cases from Jacobabad, Kashmir, Benares and Baluchistan. Bengal. 82. The Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bengal, reports that 20 cases of Glanders were admitted into the Bengal Veterinary College during the year, against 32 in the previous year. From these figures it must, however, not be deduced that Glanders is less prevalent. 83. During the year, 34 cases of Glanders and Farcy were detected in the districts, viz., 2 in Arrah, 1 in Patna, 1 in Dacca, 3 in Tippera, 6 in Nadia, 3 in Burdwan, 1 in Saran, and 17 in Sonthal Parganas. Ten of these animals died, and the rest were destroyed. 84. The Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, states that "one case from Burdwan and 17 from Dumka, were not reported to the Inspector Gene- ral, Civil Veterinary Department, and to the Military Officers, as the informa- tion was received too late to be of use. I regret to say that delays occurred in other instances. In order that, in future, immediate reports might be secured, a Circular was issued by the Director of Land Records and Agriculture, Bengal, to the District Officers, calling their attention to the urgency of the matter. I have also warned all the Veterinary Assistants. The detection of these cases of Glanders shows that the subordinate Veterinary Department is beginning to make itself felt, and that the disease is more prevalent in the mufassal than was supposed". Bombay. 85. Twenty horses were admitted to the Government Lazaretto, against 4 in 1899-1900, and 7 in 1898-99. Of the 20 admitted during the year under report, 17 were from the City and 3 from the Harbour. Three were confirmed cases, 11 were suspicious, and 6 were contacts. The 3 confirmed cases were destroyed; and 3 of the 11 suspicious cases died; but the post mortem examination proved them free from disease; the remaining 8 were discharged having proved refract- ory to the Mallein test. Of the 6 contact cases, 1 died and 5 were discharged. Glanders and Farcy Act. Act XIII of 1899. 86. The Glanders and Farcy Act is now in force in Bombay, North-Western Provinces and Oudh, Punjab, Sind and Baluchistan, and measures are being adopted to complete the staff and organization necessary to work the Act in Bengal. Cleansing of Horse- boxes and Oattle trucks. 87. Referring to paragraphs 374 to 377 of last year's Annual Administration Report, it may be noted that inspections of horse-boxes and cattle trucks have been carried out by officers of the Civil Veterinary Department at such of the cleansing railway stations as were situated within the limits of their respective jurisdiction. Owing to there being no officer of this Department appointed to the Central Provinces, no arrangements can be made for the inspection of horse- boxes and cattle trucks on the Bengal-Nagpur Railway. 88. It has been brought to my notice that the art of scientific disinfection of horse-boxes, etc., is not yet thoroughly understood by the railway subordinates in charge of the work. This, no doubt, is quite correct, but, in my opinion, it will be sufficient for all practical purposes, if the rules laid down (vide paragraph 374 of last year's Annual Administration Report) are carefully carried out. The outcome of these periodical inspections of vehicles used for the conveyance of horses and cattle by rail, has already resulted in horse-boxes and cattle trucks being found very much cleaner than they were before. c
10 PART II.-PROVINCIAL REPORT. I.-HORSE-BREEDING. Number of stallions on the Register. 89. Table I (Provincial) will show that the number of stallions present at the beginning of the year was 195, viz., 81 horses and 114 ponies. During the year 46 were added, and the same number was reduced by casualties, sales, etc., leaving a balance at the close of the year of 195, viz., 56 horses and 139 ponies. The cause of such wide differences between the horses and ponies, in the open- ing and closing balances, is due to 27 ponies having hitherto been erroneously shown as horses; this has now been corrected. Number of stallions at work. 90. Of the 195 stallions on the Register, 176 were actually employed at stud work: the remaining 19 were the new purchases, which were obtained almost at the close of the year under report. Casualties. 91. A reference to Table III (Provincial) will show that 5 stallions died, and only 1 was destroyed during the year, which must be considered as satisfactory. Sales. 92. Table IV (Provincial) shows that 1 horse and 8 pony stallions were sold during the year; the average prices realized was R400 for the horse, and E158-14-0 for each pony. Cost of feed and keep. 93. Table IX will show that the cost of feed and keep was as follows:11 102. The reported figures show that of 220,106 animals attacked, 88,536 died, giving a general percentage of 40.22. Whilst showing a higher percentage of deaths than that recorded last year, the total number reported as attacked is less by 2,09,245: this cannot, by any means, be accepted as correct. Bombay. 103. Reports were received from 12 out of the 18 districts in the Presi- dency: they show that 3,136 animals were attacked against 5,466 last year. 104. Rinderpest was reported from 6 districts, being serious in Nasik, where 943 animals died, of 1,483 attacked. The mortality from this disease, through- out the Presidency, was 65.57 per cent. 105. With the exception of a few cases of Anthrax12 favourably impressed at first, but owing to the death of some of the inoculated and to the abatement of the outbreak, they refused to continue the experiment. (b) Raniganj.13 Tick plague. 115. Referring to paragraphs 476 to 479 of last year's Annual Administra- tion Report, it may be noted that careful inspections of every consignment of horses imported from tick infected areas, were made at the ports of Calcutta and Bombay, and the Veterinary Inspector's certificates examined. No ticks were found on any of the horses imported. In Madras, owing to want of a proper staff of qualified men, the inspections could not be as thoroughly conducted as in Bengal and Bombay. VETERINARY DISPENSARIES. 116. Table XIX (Provincial) will show that the total number of cattle treated at Veterinary Dispensaries was as follows:14 122. Under sanction of the Government of India, the sum of R10,000 has been sanctioned this year in the Budget Estimate of the Civil Veterinary Depart- ment. It is intended that this amount should be awarded as prizes to cattle- breeders, in such centres of the North-Western Provinces, Punjab, Central Provinces and Baluchistan, as are known to produce distinct types of cattle. Draft Rules and Prospectuses of prizes are being prepared, and will shortly be published for adoption. As this will be the first time that cattle prizes from Imperial Funds will be awarded by this Department, the Rules and Prospec- tuses will, necessarily, embrace a general outline of the intentions of Govern- ment, modifications of these Rules being left to the discretion of District authorities to be altered to suit local circumstances. V.-VETERINARY INSTRUCTION. VETERINARY COLLEGES AND SCHOOLS. 123. The results of the examination of students at the several Veterinary Colleges and Schools show that the total number passed out as qualified amounted to 88 against 87 in the year previous, and the number that failed to satisfy the examiners, was 15 against 26 in the year 1899-1900. The following statement will show the results of examination at each institution:15 VI.-GENERAL. Remarks. 129. As the administration of this Department was only taken over by me on the 16th May 1901 and no notes left by my predecessor, I feel that I am not justified in making any remarks under this heading.

No. 38, dated Meerut, the 25th June 1901. FromXXV would spread to Shaibagh Camp, some two miles distant, where the cattle were chiefly cows and young female stock, which Mr. Mollison was anxious to save through the famine. He therefore asked me to be prepared to inoculate these in case they were attacked with rinderpest, and I despatched an urgent telegram to the Imperial Bacteriologist, Muktesar, for a supply of serum. 10. In the meantime I proceeded to Calcutta, where I was due to conduct the annual examination at the Veterinary College at Belgatchia. On com- pletion of this duty I returned to Ahmedabad, but the serum had not arrived, and as there had been no further spread of the disease, I proceeded to Ajmer to conduct the annual examination at the veterinary school at that place. 11. While there, on the 3rd April 1900, I received a telegram from Mr. Mollison stating that four cases had occurred in the Shaibagh Camp, but no serum had arrived. This was followed on the 7th by another telegram, in which it was stated that some serum had arrived, and that there were two fresh cases of rinderpest. I therefore started for Ahmedabad and arrived there on the 17th, and found that one of the cases referred to had died, and the other had so far recovered that I considered it an unsuitable subject for a supply of virulent blood. No fresh cases occurred at the Shaibagh after this, and, although there was reason to believe that the disease had died down, Mr. Mollison was anxious to have these valuable cows and heifers protected by the simultaneous method, if possible, and eventually a buffalo belonging to Mr. Moneybhai was discovered suffering from rinderpest in the city. From this animal virulent material, sufficient to inoculate 218 of the cattle at Shaibagh was obtained. At the same time 185 animals that occupied an adjoining enclosure were treated with serum only. Results.xxvi village, however, neither cattle nor their owners were to be seen, and at last when the Lambardar was found he said that they had gone to work in the fields and owners did not wish to have anything done. He, however, produced four of his own animals which I inoculated, merely to demonstrate that there was nothing dangerous in the operation. 16. I waited at Bulandshahr for three days, at the end of which time the Collector sent to the village to enquire if, after seeing the result in the Lambardar's cattle, other owners were willing to have their animals done, but they persisted in their refusal and I returned to head quarters. Result.xxvii stated that the bottles containing it were badly corked, he never suggested that the fluid was dangerously septic. 23. Dehra Dun, 25th September 1900.xxviii when Veterinary Lieutenant Walker visited the district in 1900. I was aware of this and had decided, in consultation with Dr. Lingard, before leaving Muk- tesar, that the method to be employed must be serum only. 29. I left for Rorhu, which is four long marches from Simla, on the 16th November. When passing through Jubbal on the 3rd day, the Wazir of that State came and requested that I would inoculate some cattle in the village of Dhara, two miles from Jubbal, where he said rinderpest existed, and as I intended to halt for a day at Jubbal, to allow my camp equipment to get into Rorhu, I was glad to comply with his request. 30. Rinderpest had attacked a herd of 40 cattle belonging to some charcoal burners in a small village close to Dhara, and there had been 30 deaths and eight of those remaining were suffering. Four cases were said to have occurred in Dhara, a week before my arrival, but there had been no cases since then, and this village was apparently uninfected, but as there was danger of further contagion from the neighbouring village, the cattle at Dhara, numbering 45, were treated with serum. Result.xxix produce a reaction and confer an active immunity in a very large per cent. of cattle, with a loss of less than two per cent. deaths. But I am convinced that a re-action is produced in only a very small percentage of Indian cattle submitted to it, and when no re-action is produced, the immunity which is conferred by that method is merely passive, like that conferred when serum only is used, but with this great disadvantage it lasts a shorter time. 36. The duration of an epidemic of rinderpest in most Indian villages is seldom more than two months: if, therefore, serum when used in large doses without blood can be relied on to protect an animal for three months, and even much longer, it seems to me a mistake to press the simultaneous method, which, when no reaction is produced, confers an immunity of but short duration. 37. The tours undertaken during the year by me and the distance travelled by road and railway, are attached to the report. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, W. R. HAGGER, Vety. Major, Assistant to the Inspector-General, Civil Veterinary Department.
