REPORT ON METROPOLITAN HORSE FAIRS AND DISTRICT HORSE SHOWS OF 1891-92.
REPORT ON METROPOLITAN HORSE FAIRS AND DISTRICT HORSE SHOWS OF 1891-92. Following the lines of the reports of former years, the fairs and shows held in each province during 1891-92 have been reviewed in alphabetical order, and the usual Appendices are also attached, showing2 year shown a marked improvement. He recommends the grant of Rs. 1,250 from Imperial Funds instead of Rs. 1,000, to which it has been reduced. 13. The classes are almost without exception reported on as good and very good, the branded fillies coming in for special praise. This promises well for the future stock in this district. 14. Sixteen head of young stock were purchased by the Remount Agent. This officer notices that many otherwise promising youngsters were found to be too straight in the pastern Nine horses were bought for the Bengal Cavalry. Major Martin remarks that if he had been allowed to purchase 3-year olds, he could have obtained more, and those he was able to pur- chase were the property of dealers and not zemindars. 15. Six mules competed for prizes. No purchases for Government. 16. Rs. 1,000, allotted from Imperial Funds, was increased by Rs. 1,000 from local sources: total Rs. 2,000. Of this sum, Rs. 1,922 were awarded in prizes. Four English bridles were presented to successful competitors. Etawah Horse Show. 17. This small show following close on the Batesar fair was held from the 27th November to the 3rd December 1891. 18. Owing to the fact that the large horse fair at Batesar immediately preceded it the number attending it was not as large as might be expected. Only 350 animals were registered against 352 last year. 19 Horse-breeding being quite in its infancy in this district, the show acts as an in- centive to the industry, and for this reason is worthy of encouragement. 20. The Inspector-General in person visited this show, and remarks that the branded mare class was geuerally fair, some being of very good quality. No remounts or young stock suitable for the Remount Department were obtainable. The gelding class was fair. mules competed, two being of excellent quality. 21. The arrangements were good, and both Native gentlemen and zemindars took much interest in the proceedings. 22. The Inspector-General is of opinion that it would be judicious if in future years an interval of a week or ten days were allowed to elapse between the Batesar fair and this show. 23. The whole of the Imperial grant, amounting to Rs. 250, was awarded in prizes, and three bridles were presented to deserving competitors. Hardwar Horse Fair. 24. No fair was held here last year on account of an outbreak of cholera amongst the pilgrims. Meerut (Nau- chandi) Horse Show. 25. The Meerut (Nauchandi) horse show commenced on the 20th March 1892 and con- tinued till the 27th. 26. The number of stock present was 1,292 against 1,264 last year. Of these 491 entered the judging ring as competitors, showing an increase of 56 over the number judged in 1891 and 143 over 18903 Cavalry. If the purchasing officers had been allowed to buy 3-year olds as heretofore, this number would have probably been considerably exceeded. 30. Mr. White, the Collector, remarks in his report: "But what horses are bred here are of very satisfactory quality and size, and the fact that Her Majesty's 5th Lancers, now in quarters at Meerut, are all mounted on country-bred horses, and are well pleased with their mounts, is one that is srifficient evidence of the success of the Horse Breeding Department. I have been myself absent for some eleven years from Horse-breeding districts, and I must say I was astonished at the size and stoutness of the brood mares I saw this year at Nauchandi." 31. The Judging Committee considered the mare and filly classes good and promising; young stock fair; fillies better than colts; young geldings deserving of persistent encourage- ment. 32. The Government grant of Rs. 1,950 was supplemented by Rs. 600 from local sources, making a total of Rs. 2,550, of which Rs. 2,548 were awarded. Six bridles were given to various successful competitors. Muzaffarnagar Horse Show. 33. This show commenced on the 30th March and ended on the 4th April 1892. 34. A discrepancy exists between the numbers reported as attending by the Assistant Super- intendent, Horse Breeding Department, North-Western Provinces and Rajputana, and Collector, 4 43. It has been finally resolved to abolish this show altogether. For some years it has been steadily deteriorating, and the Muzaffarnagar show on one side and the Hardwarfair on the other give ample opportunity for the exhibition and sale of stock owned by breeders in this neighbourhood. PUNJAB. Amritsar (Diwali) Horse Show. 44. This show lasted from the 25th October to the 4th November 1891. 45, A total of 4,181 head of stock against 4,649 in 1890 is shown to have attended. Of these, 161 competed for prizes against 174 last year. No remounts competed, or the number would have been 365. 46, The following are the remarks made on the various classes competing :5 59. No Remount Agent havingattended, nothing was purchased for Government or the Native Cavalry. The Deputy Commissioner considers there were several up to remount form if there had been buyers. 60. Two mules were purchased for the Native Cavalry. 61. As before remarked, there was no Imperial grant, but Rs. 1,000 were obtained from local sources, of which Rs. 605 were awarded in prizes, most of the remainder being expended in the necessary preparations. Delhi Horse Show. 62. This show was held from the 2nd to the 9th March 1892. 63. Five hundred and thirty-four head of horse stock are reported as present at the show. Of these, 27 competed for Government prizes. 64. The Assistant Superintendent, Horse-Breeding Department, North-Western Provinces and Rajputana, was unavoidably absent till the night of the 7th, so failed to attend the Judg- ing Committee; hence, I regret to say, there are no remarks as to the quality of the various classes competing, except the mule class, which is reported good by the Deputy Commissioner. 65. No young stock were purchased for Government. A Remount Agent attended the show. The Assistant Superintendent, Horse-Breeding Department, North-Western Provinces and Rajputana, in. his report shows two horses purchased for the Native Cavalry, and the Deputy Commissioner four. 66. Of the Rs. 250 allowed by Government, Rs. 119 were expended. Bridles were given to three successful competitors. Dera Ghazi Khan Horse Show. 67. This show was held on the 4th and 5th March 1892. 68. Three thousand and twenty-nine horses were present against 3,775 in 1891. This decrease is attributed by the Deputy Commissioner to the drought which had prevailed in the district during the previous year. Five hundred and forty-nine head of stock came before the Judging Committee against 583 in 1891. 69. The following are the remarks of the Judging Committee on the various classes competing:6 77. It was got up altogether by the district authorities as an experiment with a view to encourage horse and mule breeding, which are in a backward condition in this district. About 300 head of stock attended the show, of which 256 competed for prizes. 78. The Deputy Commissioner in his report remarks that more stallion power is wanted in the district to improve the stamp of stock produced. 79. At present the number of branded mares in Dera Ismail Khan is not sufficient to warrant the allotment of a larger number than is at present standing there. Instructions have been issued to the Assistant Superintendent, Horse-Breeding Department, Punjab, to visit this district early in the ensuing cold season; and if he is able to brand enough mares to warrant more stallions being sent, the wishes of the Deputy Commissioner will be complied with as far as possible. 80. The Deputy Commissioner reports that the general feeling was that the show occurred too late in the season, and expresses a hope that, if it be held again next season, some time in February will be fixed. 81. The stock as a whole is reported as weedy, showing the necessity of a supply of good stallions. 82. The following remarks on the various classes competing accompany the report of the Deputy Commissioner:7 90. The Assistant Superintendent, Horse-Breeding Department, Punjab, notes that no stock were purchased for Government. The subordinate establishment of the Remount Agent were present, but he himself did not attend. Eligible stock are represented as having been present. Twenty-two remounts were purchased for the Native Cavalry. Highest price Rs. 325, lowest Rs. 66, and average Rs. 223. 91. No mules are shown as purchased for Government, though the class is reported very good. Possibly they were under age. 92. The whole of the Imperial grant (Rs. 1,300) was spent in awards. Four bridles were also presented to owners of stock winning prizes. It may be noted that the Imperial grant does not appear to have been supplemented by any contribution from local sources. Hansi Horse Show. 93. This district has been for years past backward in horse and mule breeding. The zemindars appear to object to having their mares branded, partly because they say they find a difficulty in selling branded mares, and partly because they are under the impression that branded mares being selected as the best in the district, Government will seize them should they require horses. 94. With a view to dissipate these prejudices, it is proposed by the Deputy Commissioner, Captain Parsons, to institute a fair at Hansi. He rightly considers that an appeal to their love of money by the distribution of pecuniary rewards for good mares and stock will do more to overcome their objections than any other argument. Should stock be purchased at the show for Government and the Native Cavalry, a still stronger inducement will be offered. 95. Under these circumstances it has been considered judicious to recommend a grant of Rs. 300 for prizes to be awarded at this show in October next. Jallalabad Horse Show. 96. This show was held from the 14-th to the 16th January 1892. 97. It is gratifying to. note that 3,747 animals attended this year against 890, 191 com- peting for prizes against 129 in 1891. 98. It would appear that objections are made to holding this show at Jallalabad on account of the distance from the nearest railway station, some 12 miles, and the badness of the road. In every other respect the locality seems admirably adapted for the purpose. It is under con- sideration to build a tramway, or at least a metalled road, to connect Jallalabad with the rail- way, when this objection will no longer exist. 99. Owing to indisposition, the Assistant Superintendent was unable to attend the show. The following remarks are therefore taken from the reports of the Secretary to the Judging Committee and Veterinary-Lieutenant Blenkinsop, Consulting Veterinary Surgeon to the Punjab Government:8 Jhang Horse Show. 103. This show came off on the 26th and 27th February 1892. 104. Six hundred and forty-two horses are reported to have been present against 617 last year, showing a small increase, and 107 entries for the prizes against 101 in 1891. It is pleasing to notice this increase, as the show lately has been deteriorating. 105. The Assistant Superintendent, Horse-Breeding Department, Punjab, reports most favourably on the stamp of brood mares and stock in this show. But it would seem the class of Government stallions furnished is objected to. The Deputy Commissioner suggests that Arabs and light thorough-breds should be sent in lieu of those at present supplied, as the people are fond of light horses. Under these circumstances, it would be advisable perhaps if the District Board purchased a certain number of Arab stallions to meet the wishes of the people, and thus allow of a decrease in the number of Government horses, who could be sent to districts where they would be better appreciated. 106. The following remarks are made on the various classes:9 114. The following are the remarks on the various classes judged :10 123. The Deputy Commissioner in his report remarks: "It was again noticeable that the fillies showed much more quality than did the colts, and much more inducement should be offered to breeders to have their fillies branded. Many of them when old enough would make perfect brood mares." It would seem from the report that the breeders show a preference for the Norfolk Trotter as a sire. 124. Sixteen head of stock were purchased for Government. No officers attended to pur- chase for the Native Cavalry. The highest price paid for remounts was Rs. 425, lowest Rs. 160, and average Rs. 257. 125. No mules were purchased for Government. 126. Rs. 1,000 were allotted by Government for awards. The whole amount was ex- pended. Four bridles were likewise presented to successful competitors. Multan Horse Show. 127. This show began on the 7th and terminated on the 9th March 1892. 128. Eight hundred and ninety-seven head of stock attended against 1,454 last year; 328 competed for prizes against 454 in 1891. This falling off is attributed by the Assistant Superintendent, Horse-Breeding Department, Punjab, to the exceptionally bad season for grass, making fodder, very dear in parts of the district, unprocurable, and to the fact that big dealers and Native Cavalry purchasing agents had bought many horses prior to the fair. The Deputy Commissioner considers that this year no pressure being put on owners to bring their animals to the show, a certain number did not attend; but he is not convinced that this is the only cause of the considerable decrease in numbers. 129. The various classes competing are reported on as follows :11 Rawalpindi Horse Fair. 134. This fair was held from the 30th March to the 2nd April 1892. 135. Two thousand three hundred and two head of stock attended against 3,544 last year. Of these, 381 competed for prizes against 410 in 1891. The reason for this falling off in numbers is stated to have been scarcity and dearness of fodder due to the ravages of locusts and a bad season. 136. The remarks of the Judging Committee may be summarized as follows :12 far as possible, still, if the great desideratum of sound stock is to be attained, the utmost care must be taken to brand none but mares free from hereditary unsoundness. 147. Ten head of young stock were purchased for Government and 17 remounts for the Native Cavalry, making a total of 27, highest, lowest, and average prices being Rs. 380, Rs. 22, and Rs. 179 respectively. 148. No mules were obtained for the transport or artillery. 149. The grant of Rs. 1,700 from Imperial Funds was brought up to Rs. 1,985 by the addition of Rs. 285 from local sources. Of this, Rs. 1,964 were awarded. Four bridles were also given away to prize winners. Sialkot Horse Show. 150. This show began on the 15th and ended on the 22nd September 1891. 151. Five hundred and ninety-three head of stock were present against 428 last year, of which 159 competed for prizes against 128 in 1890. 152. The Assistant Superintendent, Horse-Breeding Department, North-Western Provinces and Rajputana (who attended this show for the Assistant Superintendent, Horse-Breeding Department, Punjab, who was absent on leave), remarks: "The stock from the Sialkot District was chiefly by Thorough-bred and Arab sires, and, although good looking, in many instances ran light." 153. This officer also suggests that the birth certificates of competitors for prizes should not be consulted till after the animal has been judged by the Committee, as prejudices for or against certain classes of sire frequently bias the decision of the judges. 154. The remarks on the various classes are as follows:13 161. The Assistant Superintendent, Horse-Breeding Department, North-Western Provinces and Rajputana, reports: "I am in great hopes that this fair will do much to encourage horse- breeding in Umballa." The competition for prizes was keen, and would have been keener, and the number of competitors much larger, if owners had thoroughly understood the rules under which the different classes are judged. This ignorance will in a year or two no doubt be removed. This officer also remarks: "The show of branded mares and fillies was good, and in- finitely better than I ever expected to see in Umballa." * * * * "As there are several very nice Arab horse and pony stallions in the district kept by the District and Court of Ward's Estates, the mares and fillies rejected by me as not of sufficient size, or not quite up to the form for mating with Government stallions, will obtain the services of good horses, instead of being relegated as in other districts to the unsound, weedy, worthless brutes kept by fakirs, chamars, and others as stallions." 162. The following are the remarks made on the various classes competing :14 171. It is not proposed to continue the grant of Government prizes at this fair. The mule- breeding industry does not seem to find favour with the people, and very little advance has been made in spite of the annual allotment made to this fair for some years past. 172. The Government grant of Rs. 100 was awarded in full. Rs. 3 from District Funds were also given as a consolation prize. Sonepore Horse Fair. TIRHOOT. 173. This fair began on the 10th and terminated on the 20th November 1891. 174. Eleven thousand four hundred and thirteen horses are reported to have been present. Of these 168 competed. This is the first time a Government grant has been allowed here. 175. The Assistant Superintendent, Horse-Breeding Department, North-Western Provinces and Rajputana, reports: "Many good-looking horses proved to be unsound on examination, and I think it very probable that they were animals rejected at the Punjab and the North-Western Provinces fairs and shows last season." 176. The Collector states: "The most remarkable feature to me was the inferiority of the 3-year old class to the 2-year old, the latter being a very good class." 177. The following are the remarks of the Judging Committee:15 Sibi Horse Show. 185. This show was held from February 29th to March 3rd, 1892. 186. One thousand two hundred and eighty-four animals attended against 1,273 in 1891. Considering that the country was suffering severely from prolonged drought and a general want of grass and fodder, this increase, though slight, is satisfactory as showing the unabated popularity of the show in spite of adverse circumstances. The then recent death of the lamented Sir R. Sandeman, too, contributed much to rob the show of the interest shown in it by the Beluch Chiefs. All the animals noted above competed for prizes. 187. Both Major Yate, the Deputy Commissioner, and Veterinary Captain Grainger, Superintendent, Horse-Breeding Department, Bombay Presidency, report the show as a great success. It is encouraging to find the Beluch and other border tribes taking an interest in these shows, and bringing their horses in for sale and exhibition in such large numbers. It is to be hoped that these horse-loving tribes will retain their liking for these meetings, and the Government and the general public be thus enabled to obtain stock from the undeniably superior class of horses existing in this part of India. 188. The following remarks are noted against the various classes competing:16 Horse Runs. 192. Rs. 100 were awarded in prizes to owners of horse runs in the Rawal Pindi dis- trict. Class of Stal- lion best suit- ed. 193. The number of 1st and 2nd prizes won by 119 Norfolk Trotter and Half-bred stal- lions was 211, by 54 Thorough-bred English 53, by 4 Australians 6, by 47 Arabs 54, by 7 Stud-breds 6, by one Turkistani nil, but won one-third prize and four others. The proportion is as follows of the total number won:APPENDIX A.
