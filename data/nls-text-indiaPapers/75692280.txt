ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, MADRAS PRESIDENCY, FOR THE YEAR 1925-26. I.2 4. Mr. Saunders spent 21 days on tour, inspected the Circle office at Coimbatore, four veterinary institutions and the Forest Department elephant camp at Mudumalai. 5. Mr. Ware spent 35 days in camp and inspected the Circle offices at Bellary and Coimbatore, five veterinary institutions, the Government cattle farms at Hosur and Coimbatore and one Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeon. He attended the meeting of the Board of Agriculture held in December 1925 and halted at Patna on his return from Pusa at the request of the Government of Bihar and Orissa in connexion with the examination of a scheme for a Veterinary College at Patna. Mr. T. J. Hurley, Officer-in-charge, I Circle, Civil Veter- inary Department, Vizagapatam, was on other duty at the Madras Veterinary College throughout the year. (b) Officers of the Madras Veterinary Service. The number of circles into which the Presidency has been divided for purposes of administration remained the same during the year under report as in the previous year, and the circles were in charge of the officers as indicated below :3 9. During the year Messrs. P. T. Saunders and T. J. Hurley and M.R.Ry. V. Krishnamurti Ayyar Avargal were confirmed in the Indian Veterinary Service. 10. M.R.Ry. V. Krishnamurti Ayyar Avargal who was deputed to undergo training at the Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research, Muktesar, for two years from May 1924 was permitted by the Government of India to terminate his studies on 30th June 1925, as he had completed the course of training laid down for him at the Muktesar Laboratory. 11. Mr. T. J. Hurley, Officer-in-charge, I Circle, Civil Veterinary Department, Vizagapatam, continued to act as Professor of Surgery, Madras Veterinary College, with the exception of fourteen days from 3rd July 1925 when he was retained as supernumerary in the college. 12. The results of the annual professional examinations were satisfactory. 13. Of the eight Veterinary Assistant Surgeons who underwent a post-graduate course during the year, six belonged to this department and two were deputed from the Civil Veterinary Department of Bihar and Orissa. All the candidates were successful at the examination held at the end of the course. 14. The number of in and out-patients treated at the college hospital was 2,766 against 2,591 in the previous year. There was an increase in the number of specimens examined in the college laboratory during the year, the number being 1.878, of which the staff of the department supplied 923 specimens against 624 in the preceding year. 15. The shoeing forge attached to the college showed a profit of Rs. 1,278-9-9 which may be considered to be very satisfactory in view of its having been handed over by the S.P.C.A. to the Madras Veterinary College on account of its being a non-paying concern. III.4 appointed temporarily to the vacancies caused by the appointment of M.R.Ry. S. D. Davadoss Pillai as officiating Inspector of Live-stock, Forest Department, vice Mr. F. Mascarenhas granted leave preparatory to retirement, and by the deputation of M.R.Ry. M. Anantanarayana Rao to the King Institute, Guindy, for special duty. The number therefore stood at 200. The employment of the staff is indicated in Table VII. During the year eleven veterinary graduates were enter- tained in the department, and the deaths of Veterinary Assistant Surgeons C. Subrahmanyam and B. Gopalakrish- nayya had to be recorded. (a) Hospitals and dispensaries. 17. At the beginning of the year under report there were 69 Government hospitals and dispensaries including the hospital at the Madras Veterinary College and the one at the Agricultural Farm, Coimbatore. During the year new dis- pensaries were opened at Harpanahalli, G5 such instruments are now on order, and in course of time it is likely to become the sole method of castration of cattle. 19. Twenty-three institutions showed a decrease in the number of cases treated when compared with the figures of the preceding year, but in most of these institutions the decrease is slight. The fall in some institutions is attributed to want of capacity and tact on the part of the Assistant Surgeon in charge, and notice is of course taken of this. On the whole, the work at the institutions has been satisfactory and the fact that there is a growing demand for more institutions shows that the people realize now their usefulness. 20. The new hospital buildings at Ad6 25. It will be noticed that there was a big rise under inoculations and this was due to severe outbreaks of rinderpest in several districts. The fall under the other three headings also was due mainly to the severity of rinderpest, and the shortage of reserve staff was also a contributing factor to this. Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons who were engaged in inoculation work could not attend to treatment of cases or perform castrations, and owing to the reduction of the leave reserve of the staff from 25 to 19 it was not possible to fill up all leave vacancies, and the arrangement made in such cases was to direct the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in the neighbourhood to be in charge of the vacant post in addition to his duties. These unfavourable conditions interfered to a large extent with the normal activities of the department. 26. The names of eight Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons have been noted for good work done. IV.7 viz., non-receipt of progress reports and receipt of intimation that the disease had subsided. 30. Rinderpest.8 to Government and the rest to private individuals. Arrange- ments were made to protect by this method the animals at the Chintaladevi Cattle Farm and the Central Jail, Vellore, but owing to the prevalence of foot-and-mouth disease amongst; the animals there, the inoculation had to be postponed. The fee of Rs. 2 per head of cattle levied for inocula- tions done by the serum simultaneous method with Muktesar virus was abolished with effect from 1st January 1926 with a view to popularize this method of inoculation. 36.

During the year the Bellary Municipality employed the local Veterinary Assistant Surgeon for meat inspection, but the municipalities of Gunt12 VII.13 outbreaks of contagious disease. It was the systematic touring which enabled Touring Veterinary Assistant Sur- geons to detect diseases which were prevalent but were not reported. Now that this system of touring is abolished and that some of the touring staff are attached to institutions and are required to attend only outbreaks of contagious disease, village officers are likely to become much more slack in this work, unless the Revenue officials exercise strict scrutiny in this matter in the course of their tours. The necessity for this has to be sufficiently impressed on the Revenue officials. 64. It appears the village panchayats can make them- selves useful in the matter referred to in the foregoing paragraph. In May 1925, the Registrar-General of Pan- chayats brought to the notice of Government that several village panchayats expressed a desire to undertake the scrutiny of statistics relating to cattle diseases and mortality, and it was ordered that village headman should send to panchayats copies of the monthly returns of cattle mortality which they submit to Tahsildars. If the panchayats take a real interest in the correct maintenance of cattle mortality registers and the prompt reporting of outbreaks of con- tagious diseases, they will be doing a great deal of good to the ryots and will also facilitate the work of this department. It is hoped that this suggestion will be duly considered by Government. 65. The scheme which has been under contemplation, of substituting veterinary dispensaries for touring posts as an experimental measure in the Kistna district? according to which the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge of a dis- pensary will, as a rule, be required to attend outbreaks of contagious disease occurring in the taluk in which the dispensary is located, has been postponed for consideration as Part II Scheme for 1927-28. 66. During the year three cattle insurance societies were formed in Chingleput district and registered. It is hoped that more societies will be formed as they ought to prove a means of improving the condition of cattle of this Presidency. 67. Civil Veterinary Department Leaflet No. VIII on Foot and Mouth disease was prepared during the year and is being printed. 68. I take this opportunity of expressing my grateful acknowledgment for the help rendered by the Revenue
14 officials, particularly for that given by Mr. G. W. Wells, District Magistrate of South Kanara, to the staff of this department in combating contagious diseases, especially Rinderpest. 69. The work of the majority of the subordinate staff has been satisfactory and the clerical staff continued to give satisfaction. MADRAS, D. A. D. AITCHISON, M.R.C.V.S., 6th July 1926.

I.32 reaction in the last-mentioned batch was not satisfactory probably due either to the animals being immune as the disease was prevailing throughout the taluk or to the virus received having become impotent. Of the animals inoculated by this method, only 18 animals belonged to Government and the rest to ryots. More animals could have been done by this method but for the fact that the ryots could not afford to give rest to the animals on account of busy season. Generally the animals will have some work or other throughout the year. There was only one mortality among the animals inocu- lated by the serum simultaneous method at Harpanahalli. 6. Veterinary leaflets were distributed to the ryots during the Health Week Exhibition in Bellary. 7. I was not able to spend any time in going to the villages with the touring staff for inspecting their field work, as I was busy with serum simultaneous inoculations for about four months in five centres and visiting some of the rinder- pest infected areas during the year. II.33 11. There was an increase both in the number of eases treated and castrations done, in the institutions at Bellary, Hospet, Kurnool and Chittoor and a fall in both at Ad34 21. There has been a decided fall in the number of cases treated and the castrations done by the itinerating staff in Bellary and Kurnool districts owing to the severity of rinderpest that prevailed in these two districts. As the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons of Rajampet, Dharma- varam and Tadpatri were deputed to work in other districts in connexion with rinderpest, the cases treated and the castrations done by these men have fallen when compared with the figures of the last year. The work turned out by the Touring Veterinary Assist- ant Surgeons of Cuddapah and Anantapur was on the increase, but there is a slight fall in the number of cases treated by the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Madanapalle, although there was an increase in the number of castrations done. There was a slight fall in the number of castrations done by the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Hindupur, which was said to be due to famine conditions that prevailed in the previous year. 22. Veterinary Assistant Surgeons M. Noor Ahmed, P. K. Rangesa Rao, H. Viswanath and K. P. Duraiswami helped me in conducting serum simultaneous inoculations in different centres.

It was only in those cases where inoculations were refused in spite of the advice given by the Revenue authorities that prosecutions were conducted. 80. In all the places wherever inoculation was con- ducted the disease subsided. In a few instances, however, re-inoculation had to be done. 31. Anthrax.37 other domestic animals which were suspected for rabies, but no continuation was sought. Only one dog was treated with anti-rabic vaccine as a preventive.

I.40 Assistant Surgeons to two of the institutions which required additional hands to meet heavy work, the opening of two new dispensaries in the last quarter of the year and the stationing of three more men in different places of the circle as leave reserve, The post of a compounder was newly sanctioned for the Veterinary Dispensary, Kumba- k41 12. There were additions to Veterinary buildings in several institutions during the year, as detailed below:42 and efficient work was turned out by some of the touring men. 17. The members of the staff visited 3,931 villages and in the course of their tours they treated 1,563 animals for contagious diseases and 9,730 for non-contagious cases and performed 2,018 castrations. In the previous year 3,497 villages were visited, 2,306 cases for contagious diseases and 9,526 for non-contagious diseases were treated and 2,980 castrations were performed. There is a reduction in the num- ber of cases treated for contagious diseases and castrations performed, the fall in the former is attributed to the absence in several parts of the districts of foot-and-mouth disease which was responsible for a large number of contagious cases treated in the previous years and in the latter is attri- buted to various causes such as unexpected floods, prevalence of cholera, famine and absence of some Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons from their permanent stations on special duty. V.43 contributed greatly towards checking the further spread of the disease. 20. In Madura district, when the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Madura, was not able to cope with the disease, the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Periya- kulam, was deputed to help him. In the affected areas, prompt action for the segregation of the affected cases was taken and inoculations were performed with satisfactory results. 21. In 93 outbreaks of the 98 received, the staff were able to visit the scenes of outbreaks but they were able to per- form preventive inoculations only in 41 of them. In five of the reports, progress reports received revealed subsidence of the disease. 8,748 inoculations were carried out and the number of deaths among the inoculated is negligible, being 9. 22. All arrangements were made for carrying out Serum Simultaneous method of inoculation in the Central Jail at Vellore, but owing to an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease amongst the animals, it had to be postponed to the next cold weather. 23. The method of smearing the nostrils with fresh fæces of Rinderpest-infected animals was tried in Madura district. 24. Hæmorrhagic septicæmia.44 disease. Only five deaths were reported among the inoculated ones. 26.

Miscellaneous46 of the cattle exported to Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States and one-half of the fees received on this account was credited to Government. 44. The Lethal chamber maintained by the Trichinopoly municipality was duly inspected by the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge, Veterinary Hospital, Trichinopoly. 45. In the year under review 98 village officers were reported for slackness in reporting outbreaks of contagious diseases and in the maintenance of cattle mortality registers. 46. The work has been very heavy on account of the gradual increase of the executive staff, and the office staff experienced much difficulty in coping with the work. The work will, however, assume normal conditions when the proposed new circle at Madura is formed. 47. The sooner the supply of a lecture lantern to each circle office is made the better, as a good deal of propaganda work can be carried out in camp dispensaries in villages. A. J.

Two new posts of compounders for the hospitals at Ootacamund and Mangalore were sanctioned during the year. (a) Hospitals and dispensaries. 7. Two new dispensaries49 were less than that of the previous year, viz., Putt50 16. The number of non-contagious disease cases treated by the touring staff in the circle during the year shows a small increase over that of the previous year and the number under contagious diseases is very much less. Foot-and- mouth disease being the determing factor, as a rule, for the increase or decrease, the fall under this head is due to that disease being less extensively prevalent in the districts of this circle than in the previous year. As it has been decided that, with the gradual redaction of itinerating billets, the present system of touring should be done away with, the statistics of cases treated on tour will not be a prominent feature in reviewing the work of this department in future. The work of the itinerating staff on the whole has been satisfactory and no further comment seems to be called for. III.51 district, 7,722 were compulsory inoculations under the Act. At the instance of the pound-keeper at M52 22. Hæmorrhagic septicæmia.53 affected being seven. Two of these were destroyed under the Act and compensation was paid; the rest died before action could be taken for payment of compensation. All the carcasses were properly disposed of under professional super- vision and the premises disinfected. The Chairman, Munici- pal Council, was requested to appraise the horse owners in the town by beat of tom-tom of the outbreak and the Municipal Veterinary Assistant Surgeon was instructed to inspect the animals in the neighbourhood and to report suspicious cases. The outbreak subsided. Trypanosomes were also detected in three buffaloes; one dog and eight bullocks amongst the animals brought to the veterinary hospital, Coimbatore, for treatment. The dog succumbed and the buffaloes and bullocks did not die during the period they were under observation of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon. Tartar emetic intravenously was tried in these cases and it had the effect of clearing temporarily the trypa- nosomes from peripheral circulation. All the cases of Trypanosomiasis were confirmed by microscopic examination. 28. Johne's disease.54 33.

Since the close of the year sanction has been accorded to the opening of six new dispensaries at MNo. 1403, DEVELOPMENT, 25TH SEPTEMBER 1926 9 staff treated 16,951 cases against 31,626. In this connexion the Government regret to observe that a number of village officers still fail to realize the importance of promptitude in reporting outbreaks of disease. Now that the systematic touring by Veterinary Assistant Surgeons has been abolished, the responsibility for scrutinizing the work of the village officers in this respect rests entirely on the shoulders of revenue officials, and Government trust that they will fully realize their responsibility in this matter and bring about an appreciable improvement. Orders were issued during the year that village headmen should send copies of monthly returns of cattle mortality to village panchayats. If these bodies take a real interest in the correct maintenance of cattle mortality registers and the prompt reporting of out- breaks of contagious diseases they will do a great deal of good to the ryots. The Government are glad to note that 45 municipalities have so far adopted by-laws for the maintenance of cattle mortality registers which will facilitate the work of the department and it is hoped that others will follow. 7. The number of convictions under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1890, was 5,562 against 4,704 in the previous year. The number of animals sent to veterinary infirmaries for treatment was 697 against 930 in previous year. As usual more than 50 per cent of the convictions under the Act come from Trichinopoly. A tendency on the part of the people of Trichinopoly to employ cheap and worn out animals to draw heavy loads, and the activity of the local branch of the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals are reported to have contributed to the increase. The Government are glad to note that all the district boards except Salem and all the municipalities have exempted unladen animals taken to veterinary institutions for treatment from payment of tolls. The Government hope that the Salem District Board also will soon follow the example of the other local bodies. 8. At the end of the year 23 municipalities were utilizing the services of veterinary assistant surgeons for meat inspection. It is highly desirable that this important work which affects the food of the people should be under expert control. The Government, therefore, earnestly hope that the other municipalities will not hesitate to spend a small amount towards fees for the veterinary assistants. B
10 No. 1403, DEVELOPMENT, 25TH SEPTEMBER 1926 9. The working of the Veterinary College and the hospital attached to it continued to be satisfactory. The number of students in the college in all the three classes on 31st March 1926 was 60 against 74 in the previous year. The decrease is probably due to want of prospects of Government employment for those who pass out of the college and to the number of stipends in a year being restricted to 15. The Committee for the selection of candi- dates for admission to the college was reconstituted during the year. Appointment of veterinary graduates to the department has also since been entrusted to the Staff Selection Board. 10. The receipts and expenditure of the department as reported by the Accountant-General are as follow:No. 1403, DEVELOPMENT, 25TH SEPTEMBER 1926 11 the deputation of Mr. Ware to Muktesar, the administration of the department and the college continued to be satis- factory.

ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE MADRAS CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT FOR THE YEAR 1926-27 MADRAS PRINTED BY THE SUPERINTENDENT, GOVERNMENT PRESS PRICE, 12 annas.] 1927
ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, MADRAS PRESI- DENCY, FOR THE YEAR 1926-27. I.2 4. The following officers were in charge of the six circles as indicated below:3 for the opening of 12 veterinary dispensaries yearly. Casual- ties from various causes in the department during a year now average 5, so that even at the present slow rate of development, 6 men short of the number which will be required for the year 19274 12. The total number of in and out-patients treated at institutions throughout the Presidency was 112,349 against 104,059 cases during the previous year. In addition, 3,424 animals were castrated. 1,404 of these were done by the Burdizzo method; the total figures show an improvement over the previous year by 321 and those done by the Burdizzo method by 768. The number of cases which were supplied with medicine without the patients being brought to hospital fell from 5,998 in 1925-26 to 4,923 in 1926-27. It is hoped that this method of treatment will gradually disappear altogether. 13. The system of closing dispensaries in order that the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge may attend outbreaks of contagious disease has worked detrimentally on the number of patients treated in 14 institutions. 14. The dispensaries at Srivilliputtur and Yellamanchili which wore opened in 1915 and 1923 respectively were not able to show satisfactory work and they were transferred during the year to Rajapalaiyam and Anakapalle. In both cases, the move of the institutions promises well. In Hospet the dispensary was located in a building belonging to the Forest Department and which was too much at one end of the town. At the suggestion of the late Minister of Development, the dispensary was moved to a rented build- ing in a more central position. I doubt, however, the likeli- hood of the dispensary doing satisfactory work in Hospet and I anticipate its removal elsewhere. At Adoni the dispensary was moved into newly con- structed buildings and it has now become a hospital with accommodation for in-patients. Government have accepted the very generous offer of the Raja of Bobbili to supply the requisite buildings for a veterinary hospital to be opened at Bobbili and an annual contribution of Rs. 660 towards its maintenance. 15. The acquisition of the rented dispensary buildings at Puttur and Pollachi and the construction of permanent hospi- tal buildings for the dispensaries at Nandyal, Kumbakonam and Parvatipur have been sanctioned. (b) Itinerating. 16. The number of touring posts were increased from 82 to 88 during the year by the creation of six new posts with headquarters at Amalapuram, Dhone, Mangalore, Calicut, Tanjore and Ramnad.
5 17. As the result of a change of policy in the work of the touring staff, 34 Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons have been attached to the veterinary institutions at their headquarters. Each of these Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons is responsible for attending outbreaks of contagious diseases in specified taluks and in the absence of outbreak reports to assist the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge of the dispensary or hospital to which they are attached. The remaining 54 Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons are required to run camp dispensaries in important centres of specified taluks for periods of about ten days at each place. 18. A comparative statement of the work done by the touring staff in the last two years is given below :6 inspection. For the last two years the ordinary work of the department has been increased by a very severe and wide- spread outbreak of rinderpest. With the total abolition of the Inspectors in the department, the work of combating this outbreak in many places has had to be largely in the hands of the ordinary Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeon with no senior inspecting officer to guide or help him in the currying out of his work. Government have been addressed on the necessity of a personal assistant to each of the Circle officers, but I am not satisfied that that addition will supply the proper super- vision required in the department, and I am quite prepared to predict that Government will find it necessary to again create the appointment of Inspectors in the department or as an alternative to considerably increase the number of circles. IV.7 Several outbreaks in the Bellary Circle could not be attended to for want of time and staff. The reasons attributed to non-attendance of other outbreaks were the same as those stated in previous years, viz., non-receipt of progress reports and receipt of intimation that the disease subsided. 23. Rinderpest.8 29. Five hundred and ninety-seven animals were protected against rinderpest by the serum simultaneous method of which 231 belonged to Government and the rest to private indi- viduals. 30. Hæmorrhagic septicæmia.9 41. Rabies.10 cattle fairs at Pallavaram, Singaperumalkoil and Wallajahbad were ordered to be closed temporarily for a period of one month. VI.11 of cattle mortality registers and the prompt reporting of out- breaks of cattle diseases will be much less owing to the abolition of systematic touring, Government have ordered the Revenue officials to exercise strict control and supervision over the work of village munsifs in these respects. Govern- ment have also included a question in the jamabandi check memorandum with a view to make the Revenue officials check efficiently the cattle mortality registers. MADRAS, D. A. D.

12 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE MADRAS VETERINARY COLLEGE FOR THE YEAR 1926-27. General administration.18 till the end of the year. His post of Senior Lecturer was held by the Second Lecturer from 1st April 1926 to 29th June 1926 and it was vacant from 30th June 1926 to 9th November 1926. 8. Selection of candidates.14 11. During the year, 2 students who graduated from the College in 1924, 7 who graduated in 1925 and 5 who graduated in 1926 were provided with appointments in the Civil Veterinary Department of this Presidency. 12. Work of the Hospital.15 17. During the year vaccine for the treatment of 22 cases of Bovine Lymphangitis and 14 cases of other infections were supplied to the staff of the Department and reports received show that the vaccine treatment for the former was effective. 18. Sanction was received only in September 1926 for Conducting Research Work on Tuberculosis among cattle and no material progress should therefore be made during the year. However in spite of the heavy routine work which the staff of the Laboratory had during the year, a study of the lesions of Tuberculosis as met with among the cattle of the Madras Corporation was made and the observations show that the lesions occurring in them in Madras are as widespread as are usually found amongst English cattle in England. 19. A study of the neoplasms occurring in the animals of this Presidency was also made during the year and it indi- cates that Carcinoma is the most prevalent. It has a high incidence in cattle and the common sites are the horn core and Membrana Nictitans. 20. A study was also made during the year on the epidemic that broke out amongst the Bangalore hounds during the latter half of the year. From the observations made so far it is not possible to venture any definite opinion as to the exact nature of the disease from which these hounds have suffered, though in those that were kept under observation at this college kidney lesions were found predominating. 21. During the year towards the beginning of October, eight animals from the Bangalore Dairying Institute were sent to this College by the Acting Director, Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research, for being kept under observation and investigation by one of his officers and every assistance was given to this officer by the staff of the Laboratory in the conduct of his investigations. As one of the animals, a cow, was found in a dying condition, she had to be destroyed before the arrival of this officer and on post mortem she was found to be suffering from Johne's disease. 22. Glanders.16 23. Rabies.17 horses in the City on his systematic tours. Of these two showed clinical symptoms of Surra, one of which died before confirmation, in the other, Surra was confirmed and the animal destroyed. There was no case of Trypanoso- miasis during the year amongst the cattle belonging to the Corporation. 28. Tuberculosis.18 36. Expenditure.19 41. At the end of the course the usual examination was conducted by an Examining Board, the members of which were:1. The Madras Veterinary College (Part View Front).

I.22 rinderpest in this circle during the year under report23 New buildings. 6. New buildings were sanctioned for the Veterinary Dis- pensary, Parvatipur, but the construction was not commenced dining the year. 7. It may be mentioned here that the total income by way of admission fees, medicine charges and other receipts realized during the year was Rs. 802-4-6 against Rs. 859-8-10 of last year. This increase in the receipts was mainly due to credit- ing to Government a moiety of fees charged by the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge of the Veterinary Hospital, Coca- nada, for examining and certifying castor seed for export. 8. The working of veterinary institutions in the circle during the year was in general good and they are steadily gaining in popularity and usefulness. (b) Itinerating. 9. One new touring billet was opened during the year with effect from 0th November 1926 with headquarters at Amalapuram. The headquarters of the touring billet opened on 30th March 1928 at Pithapuram was shifted to Peddapuram from 11th June 1926 with a view to turn out better and useful work. The total number of touring billets at the end of the year in the circle was 16, A comparative statement of the work done by the touring staff during the last two years is given below for reference.

From the above details it will be noticed that there was an increase in the number of inoculations carried out, contagious cases treated, and castrations performed. The. slight fall of over 800 under non-contagious cases treated is mostly due to the receipt of a large number of outbreak reports during the year and to the fact that systematic touring was abolished from June 1926. The fall was also partly due to the continued illness of some Government elephant or other in the Agency which required the uninterrupted attention of the touring staff in the Agency preventing them from going out on tour. * Excluding the 42 inoculations done by the serum simultaneous method by the Circle Officer.

The Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons, Atmakur and Kanigiri, were inspected only once as these touring billets were newly opened. As the second Veterinary Assistant Surgeon at Bezwada was on leave, he was inspected only once. The second Veterinary Assistant Surgeon at Gudivada was posted to Rapur as addi- tional Veterinary Assistant Surgeon owing to prevalence of rinderpest in Rapur. So he was inspected only once. 3. I inspected the building at Venkatagiri for the loca- tion of the veterinary dispensary there and also the site intended for it. Sites for the construction of permanent buildings for veterinary institutions at Bandar and Gudivada were also inspected. 4. I attended the veterinary dispensary, Bezwada, during my stay at headquarters. 5. All possible attempts were made to carry out serum simultaneous inoculation by local virus but ryots were not in favour of it. III.30 10. The District Boards of Nellore, Guntur, Kistna and West Godavari and all the Municipal Councils have exempted persons bringing animals for treatment at veterinary institu- tions from paying toll-gate fees. 11. During the year under report one temporary in- patients' shed was erected at the veterinary dispensary, Ven- katagiri, by the Raja of Venkatagiri. One temporary wait- ing shed was constructed at the veterinary dispensary, Gudivada. (b) Touring Staff. 12. Owing to the prevalence of rinderpest in Nellore district, 7 additional Veterinary Assistant Surgeons had to be posted with headquarters at Kota, Rapur, Nellore, Muthukur, Allur, Buchireddipalem and Udayagiri to prevent the spread of the disease. The dates of opening or closing or otherwise of the above posts are given below:31 16. A comparative statement showing the work done by the touring staff is shown below:32 disease Was very severe in Kanigiri. In 6 cases specimens were sent of which 2 were declared negative and the remain- ing 4 were not typical of Bacillus Chauveoi. 21. Foot-and-mouth disease.33 32.

I.35 simultaneous method against rinderpest with local virus in Magalam of Hadagalli taluk of Bellary district. There was no mortality among the animals so inoculated. The method is gaining popularity among the ryots and I hope to do fairly a large number during 1927--28. 5. I inspected the Government animals at Hagari and Nandyal farms and the animals belonging to the Central Jail at Bellary. 6. One bull at the dairy farm, Bangalore, was tested with tuberculin and the method of castration by Burdizzo's instru- ment was demonstrated in some institutions and villages. 7. In connexion with certain allegations against the acting Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Madanapalle, I visited Punganur and some villages near by for the purpose of enquiry. While at Punganur I got a photograph of a cow said to be the only surviving cow of the famous Punga- nur breed in Punganur. 8. While at headquarters I have frequently attended the veterinary hospital for the purpose of rendering profes- sional aid to the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge. II.36 against 12,203 of the previous year. A fall in the number of " Cases supplied with medicines but not brought to the institutions " has been observed. 12. There was an increase both in the number of admissions and castrations performed in Bellary, Harpanahalli and Madanapalle institutions, an increase in the number of admis- sions only in Anantapur, Hindupur and Cuddapah institu- tions and an increase only in the number of castrations done in Kurnool dispensary. There was a slight fall in the number of admissions and castrations done in Nandyal, Chittoor and Hospet dispen- saries, a fall in the number of admissions only in Kurnool dispensary and a fall in the number of castrations done in Hindupur and Cuddapah institutions. The fall in the number of cases treated in Hospet and Kurnool was due to the fact that the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons in charge had to go out on tour closing the institu- tions for a longer period for attending the outbreak reports received in their respective taluks. The number of admissions in the dispensary at Proddatur is not very satisfactory. Its progress will however be watched. 13. The veterinary institution at Adoni was moved to the Government hospital buildings which were completed during the year and the veterinary institution at Hospet was moved to a private building as the Government building in which it was located was found to be far from the town. 14. All the district boards and the municipalities in this circle have exempted unladen animals going to the veteri- nary institutions for treatment from payment of tolls. 15. The Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge of the veterinary dispensary, Nandyal, was attending to the farm animals whenever there was a necessity. 16. The veterinary institutions at Nandyal, Adoni, Har- panahalli, Chittoor, Madanapalle and Cuddapah have each a second Veterinary Assistant Surgeon attached under the new policy. The work done by each of these and the touring work turned out by the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons in charge of veterinary dispensaries at Hospet, Kurnool, Koil- kuntla, Anantapur and Hindupur have been shown under itinerating staff. The system of asking the Veterinary
37 Assistant Surgeons in charge of veterinary institutions to attend outbreaks in their respective taluks has been detri- mental to the proper working of the institutions as they had to be closed for a longer period than two or three days at a time. (b) Itinerating. 17. On the 31st March 1927 there were 19 touring officers including six second Veterinary Assistant Surgeons attached to veterinary institutions and one additional Veterinary Assistant Surgeon posted from the IV Circle to combat rinderpest excluding the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons in charge of the veterinary institutions at Hindupur, Anantapur, Kurnool, Hospet and Koilkuntla who are also required to attend outbreaks in their respective taluks. 18. One new touring billet was opened in Dhone and the touring offices at Kurnool, Hindupur, Anantapur, Tadpatri, Hospet and Kamalapuram were closed and they were instead opened at Nandikotkur, Penukonda, Kalyandrug, Gooty, Kudligi and Proddatur respectively during the year under the new policy. 19. There has been a fall in the number of cases treated for non-contagious diseases and the number of castrations performed by touring staff when compared with the figures of the previous year owing to the severity of rinderpest and black-quarter that prevailed in this circle. It is also due to change of nature of work among the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons on tour to a certain extent. Besides the above, when some of the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons went either on ordinary leave or on sick leave the places had to be kept vacant for a long time for want of hands, although arrangements had been made to attend outbreaks occurring in their jurisdiction. 20. Veterinary Assistant Surgeons P. K. Rangesa Rao and K. S. Ramachandran helped me in conducting serum simultaneous inoculation at Magalam of Bellary district. III.38 severe in Cuddapah, part of Kurnool, Bellary and Anantapur districts. It also broke out in Chandragiri taluk of Chittoor district in the latter part of the year. 22. The disease that prevailed last year continued to spread in Bellary and Kurnool districts, and the cattle traffic was responsible for the outbreak of the disease in Cuddapah, Anantapur and Chittoor districts. 23. The provisions of the Cattle Disease Act were enforced in Cuddapah and Anantapur districts in the latter part of the year, throughout the districts for a period of six months. In the districts of Bellary and Kurnool, the Act was in force for some time, and in the latter part of the year, although there was disease, the provisions of the Act were not enforced as there was no opposition for the serum alone method of inoculation and as the disease was subsiding. Many of the taluks in the Kurnool district are now free from the disease. 24. In this circle 56,057 animals were inoculated against rinderpest by " serum alone " method and 81 animals by serum simultaneous method. 25. The inoculation has done immense good in checking the outbreak. In very many instances the primary inocula- tion alone was sufficient to put down the disease. 26. There was not any opposition for the " serum alone " method of inoculation worth mentioning although there was an inkling of it in a few villages of the western taluks of Bellary district. This was overcome by prosecuting about 70 persons who were convicted. 27. The Revenue authorities continued to render help in the matter of inoculation and reporting outbreaks promptly. 28. Anthrax.89 reported. Of which 275 were attended and the remaining 297 were lodged either for want of time or progress reports. The number of animals inoculated against this disease with serum alone method was 7,307. 31. Foot-and-mouth disease40 in every case. No poison was found in five cases and a report on the last one was pending. In one, the case was withdrawn and in the other no action was taken. The result of the remaining cases was not known. 39. Malicious injury.41 45. Out of the total number of castrations done by the staff, 288 were done by the Burdizzo's instrument which is gaining popularity. 46. Office.42 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE IV CIRCLE, CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, MADRAS, FOR 1926-27. I.43 3. The Madras Veterinary Journal, of which I was the Editor ever since its start, had to be discontinued during the early part of the current year. Since the advent of the Indian Veterinary Journal, there has been a falling off in the number of articles received from the contributors and as it was felt that it was quite unnecessary to run two veterinary periodicals in the Madras Presidency at the same time, it was decided to cease publishing the Madras Veterinary Journal and the balance of amount available after writing off all bad debts was handed over as a donation to the Principal, Madras Veteri- nary College, for the Madras Veterinary College Medical Association, the formation of such association or debating society, the journal more than once said it would foster. II.44 expenditure of Rs. 11,200 on the construction of a veterinary hospital at Kumbakonam, Tanjore district, was approved by Government and it is proposed to provide funds for the work in the budget estimate for 1927-28. Arrangements are being made by the Public Works Department for the pre- paration of detailed plans and estimates. IV.45 The Cattle Disease Act was enforced in the whole district for a period of three months from 22nd December 1926 and the cattle fairs at Pallavaram, Singaperumalkoil and Walaja- bad were closed temporarily for a period of one month from 21st January 1927. 14. In North Arcot district rinderpest broke out in Yema- ganapalle village in Kangundi division of Tiruppattur taluk in September last, the source of infection being traced to a calf brought to the village from Krishnagiri, Salem district, which had the first attack and died. I applied to the Collector for compulsory inoculation after the provisions of the Cattle Disease Act have boon put in force in the area which was readily granted, as the people refused inoculation several times, notwithstanding the persuasions of the local Veterinary Assistant Surgeon and the Deputy Tahsildar, Kangundi division. Before compulsory inoculations could be undertaken, I visited the village myself and spoke to the people and appealed to the good sense of some of the refractory members of the village who had superstitious beliefs about the disease and explained to them about the benefits of the inoculations and the people submitted their animals before compulsion could be brought in. The whole lot of animals were inoculated and reinoculat- ed and the disease subsided, the geographical situation of the village with big hillocks on three sides affording no trespass of men or cattle, having helped us a good deal in the arrest of further spread. The Cattle Disease Act, however, continued to be in force in the whole district to enable the Collector to order the closure of cattle fairs whenever necessity arose, as there was disease in Chingleput district. 15. Hæmorrhagic septicæmia.46 17. Anthrax.47 injury were examined on the whole on lawful requisition by the police and it was necessary to conduct post-mortem examinations on 7 of them. 27. Government Livestock.48 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE V CIRCLE, CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, COIMBATORE, FOR 192C--27. I.49 7. During the year the number of cases treated including castration in the hospitals and dispensaries was 26,484 as against 24,978 in the previous year, the increase being to the credit of the institutions at Ootacamund, Coimbatore, Erode, Tiruppur, Gobichettipalayam, Dharapuram and Krishnagiri. There was a slight decrease at Salem, Cannanore, Calicut, Coonoor, and Puttur as compared with the figures for the previous year but in none of these institutions it could be ascribed to want of popularity. 8. There has been a noticeable improvement in the matter of remanding cruelty cases for treatment to infirmaries under the S.P.C.A. Act, the total for the Coimbatore district being 868, an increase of 464 over the previous year. In no other district in the jurisdiction of this circle the S.P.C.A. is so well organised. It is not for a moment suggested that the institutions in places without such societies, arc handicapped. In fact, an examination of the admission registers of the hospitals will refute the suggestion occasionally made to that effect in some quarters. 9. The number of cases supplied with medicines but not brought to the institutions was 649 as against 571 in the previous year. The variations under this head need no comment. 10. The work of remodelling and improving the in-patient accommodation at the Veterinary Hospital, Coonoor, was proceeded with during the year. New type-design wards for Bovines, Equines and Canines have been provided. In- patient accommodation for Canines at the Veterinary Hospital, Ootacamund, has been found to be inadequate. Proposals for additional kennels have been submitted. An operation room for small animals at this hospital has supplied an useful addi- tion. A similar one for Coimbatore is under proposal. The Tiruppur Race Club has been so good as to promise a very liberal contribution towards the cost of its construction. The S.P.C.A., Coimbatore, has also donated Rs. 100 towards the same. Our thanks are due to the donors for their munifi- cence, and personally I wish to express my gratitude to Mr. A. R. Cox, I.C.S., for the support given to me in the matter. 11. Proposals for the acquisition of the rented dispensary buildings at Puttur and Pollachi, materialised during the year. As it is becoming increasingly difficult to find suitable rented 7
50 buildings for the growing needs of the more progressive institutions, the question of providing permanent habitation requires early consideration. 12. It is gratifying to be able to record that the admissions and average daily attendance of cases in most of the hospitals and dispensaries have been remarkably good. II (b).51 III.52 19. Foot-and-mouth disease.53 29. Criminal.54 35. The relief afforded by the formation of an additional circle at Madura, has not been appreciable. This circle is still heavy, and the clerical staff inadequate. 36. A suitable and a permanent building for this office has been a long-felt want. Through the kindness of the District Collector a site has been secured in the compound in which other public offices are located, and it is hoped that sanction would be accorded at an early date for the construc- tion of the building.

55 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE VI CIRCLE, CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, MADURA, FOR 1926-27. I.56 5. The decline in attendance at some of the institutions is regrettable and is due mainly to the illiteracy of the ryots of the neighbourhood who do not realize what a boon a veteri- nary institution has got to confer upon their afflicted animals. In Kallarnad especially which forms a major portion of the two districts of Madura and Ramnad, this apathy towards veterinary aid is still unabated. Besides some of these veteri- nary institutions like Virudhunagar are situated in non- agricultural centres where only a few cattle are maintained. The veterinary assistant surgeons in charge of these insti- tutions have been asked to exert and make earnest endeavours to enhance the popularity of these institutions. IV 57 11. Anthrax.58 of outbreak reports. It is desirable that both these Veteri- nary Assistant Surgeons should in future be required to go on regular tour like other Touring Veterinary Assistant Sur- geons in this circle so that some substantial work may be turned out by them. 21.

The sanctioned cadre of Veterinary Assistant Surgeons is 223 at present. It is proposed to open 12 veterinary dispensaries during the year 1927-28. As the present system by which the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons are attached as 2nd Veterinary Assistant Surgeons to certain institutions and required to attend outbreak reports only is not working satisfactorily, it is proposed to modify the system so that the 2nd Veterinary Assistant Surgeons attached to institutions may run camp dispensaries like other Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons.

It was the intention that such of these assistants as were attached to existing institutions should attend to outbreaks of contagious disease when required. The Veterinary Adviser has now- stated that one result of the new arrangement has been that the number of cases treated has decreased. In order to prevent the continuance of such a state of affairs the Government have decided that the veterinary assistant surgeons who were formerly expected to tour regularly and who are now attached to institutions should run camp dispensaries like the rest when not required to attend to outbreaks of contagious disease. They hope that this will result in more satisfactory work. 4. The Veterinary Adviser has drawn attention to the paucity of staff in his department, The Government are convinced that considerable expansion is not only possible but desirable ; but as it takes time to train men and build hospitals the expansion must be gradual. The Veterinary Adviser has stated that only eleven men graduated from the Veterinary College during the year and he cal- culates that even on the assumption that only twelve new veterinary dispensaries should be opened each year the number of men turned out by the college during the year 1926-27 is six short of the normal requirements of the department. He states that the reason for a shortage of students at the college is that the number of stipends was reduced from 40 to 15 in each class with effect from the year 1923. In order that there may be a sufficiency of trained recruits to the department it is necessary that as many men as possible should seek training at the college and with a view to effect this the Government are considering the question of increasing the number of stipends. 5. The Veterinary Adviser has also stated that owing to the inadequacy of the sanctioned leave reserve in the department it was possible to depute only four veterinary assistant surgeons to attend the post-graduate course which is held at the college each year. Proposals to increase the reserve staff are at present under consideration. 6. The Veterinary Adviser is of the opinion that it will be necessary once again to introduce the grade of inspectors in the department. Whatever inherent advantages there may be in such a system it would not be practicable to reappoint these inspectors at present. The former inspectors are now veterinary assistant surgeons in the selection grade and most of them are in charge of veterinary hospitals and dispensaries. If they were to be taken off this duty and be made purely inspecting officers as they were before, certain hospitals and dispensaries would have to be closed. Further Govern- ment are not of the opinion that it has been demonstrated that circle officers cannot inspect the various veterinary assistants' work
No. 1501, DEVELOPMENT, 22ND SEPTEMBER 1927 7 sufficiently often and thoroughly. In connection with this question of supervision the Veterinary Adviser has referred to the necessity for a personal assistant to each of the circle officers. The question of appointing such assistants is at present under the consideration of Government. 7. During the year there were 46,371 deaths from contagious diseases. Out of this number 21,476 deaths were due to rinderpest. This disease has been virulent and widespread for some years. It is a disease which is extremely difficult to check and although every effort has been made by means of inoculation and the introduction of the Cattle Diseases Act, large numbers of cattle still succumb to it. The Government are considering the question of organizing the resources of the Veterinary Department in a more effective manner so that the disease may be diminished in its incidence, if not entirely stamped out. Of the two systems of inoculation adopted, one, the serum-alone method, is easily administered but gives only a very short period of immunity while the other, the serum-simultaneous method, confers permanent immunity but is attended with certain difficulties. The Veterinary Adviser reports that during the year 597 animals were protected against rinderpest by the serum-simul- taneous method. The Government are considering how the number of animals inoculated by this method can be increased. Two of the chief difficulties in the way are the sentimental objections of the ryots and the necessity for highly trained officers to make the inoculation. 8. The work at the Madras Veterinary College continued to be satisfactory. The Government are considering the question of improving the standard of education at the college.

I.2 6. Mr. T. J. Hurley was in charge of the IV Circle until 18th April 1927, when he proceeded on combined study leave out of India. Mr. V. Krishnamurthi Ayyar remained as Pro- fessor of Pathology and Bacteriology, Madras Veterinary College, throughout the year. (c) Madras Veterinary Service. 7. Mr. G. T. D'Silva continued to hold the post of Assist- ant Professor and Personal Assistant to the Principal, Madras Veterinary College, until 7th August 1927, when he availed himself of long leave preparatory to retirement. His post was filled at different times by Mr. M. Sundaranathan and Mr. K. S. Nair, M.R.C.V.S., the latter having been directly recruited to the Provincial Service on 2nd December 1927. 8. Mr. H. C. Sampath Ayyangar was in charge of the III Circle for the first part of the year and on 9th August 1927 took over the I Circle, where he displaced Mr. M. R. V. Panik- kar, who acted as Professor of Surgery, Madras Veterinary College, from 8th July 1927 until the end of the year. Mr. M. Anant Narayan Rao held charge of the III Circle from 30th July 1927 till the end of the year. 9. Mr. R. Narasinga Rao was in charge of the II Circle during the year, except for a period of three months leave, when Mr. C. Suryanarayanamurthi acted for him. Messrs. K. Kailasam Ayyar and A. Ramachandra Ayyar held charge of the V and VI Circles respectively throughout the year, and Mr. A. J. Wilson did the same in the IV Circle, except for the first 17 days in April 1927. (d) Subordinate. 10. The sanctioned cadre of Veterinary Assistant Surgeons on 31st March 1928 was 230, but only 223 had been appointed up to that date. The manner in which these men were employed is shown in Table VII. During the year 17 new graduates were entertained in the department, one Veteri- nary Assistant Surgeon resigned and one was dismissed. Mr. S. I). Devadoss Pillai, formerly a Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in this department, was transferred to the Forest Department as Inspector of Livestock from 2nd November 1927.

3 12. The total number of students in the College again show- ed an increase over the previous year, there being 86 on the rolls, of whom 82 appeared for the annual examinations in March 1928. Out of 22 students in the final year, 19 gradu- ated, and the percentage of passes in the other classes was also very high. The Board of Examiners remarked in their report that the rules for these examinations were more lenient than was desirable, and the sanction of Government has recently been obtained to a slight revision. 13. The Post-Graduate class, which was held from July to December, contained only 4 Veterinary Assistant Surgeons of this department, the total of 8 being made up with 3 Veterinary Assistant Surgeons from Bihar and Orissa and 1 Veterinary Graduate working in the Federated Malay States. All except the latter passed the examination at the end of the course. 14. The hospital attached to the College showed a consi- derable total increase over the figures of the previous year, but the number of in-patients appears to be decreasing steadily. A proposal is before Government to open a branch dispensary in the neighbourhood of Rayapuram with the idea of providing Veterinary relief in the northern part of the City and also in the hope that this will act as an advertisement for the parent hospital and so provide more clinical material, which is so necessary for the proper training of the students. 15. A comparison of the figures given in the Principal's report will show to what extent the routine work of the Laboratory of the College has increased in the last two years, and in order to relieve the Professor of Pathology from some of this work an improvised Parasitological section was formed towards the end of the year. The arrangement is working satisfactorily and it seems probable that this section has come to stay. A third Laboratory Assistant was sanctioned during the year. 16. Towards the close of the year an attempt was hurried- ly made at the College to produce a suitable Rinderpest virus in sufficient quantities to meet the heavy demands which were being made for this from the districts. A few minor difficul- ties were encountered in this initial attempt, but it is hoped to overcome these shortly, when the College should be in a position to help very materially in the organised campaign against Rinderpest which is so much needed. 17. Three Harland lecture lanterns have been purchased for distribution amongst the Circle officers of the department for the purpose of propaganda work, and the slides for these
4 are being prepared at the Veterinary College. The College itself has been doing some propaganda work in the City for several years past by participating in the Health and Baby Exhibition held annually in the South Indian Athletic Associ- ation Grounds, and this year Mr. Krishnamurthi Ayyar, Pro- fessor of Pathology, who has designed and arranged the exhi- bits each year, had the satisfaction of seeing the Veterinary College awarded the first prize for exhibits of popular scientific interest. 18. A review of the work of the Madras Veterinary Col- lege during the past year would not be complete without a reference to the retirement of Mr. G. T. D'Silva, for many years its Assistant Principal and lately "termed Assistant Pro- fessor and Personal Assistant to the Principal. In all, Mr. D'Silva has spent 28 years in the service of his country, and of these 21 years were spent on the teaching staff of the Madras Veterinary College. His influence on the department as a whole has therefore been enormous and it will be very difficult adequately to fill his place. III.5 Professor of Pathology at the College. This officer, Mr. Krishnamurthi Ayyar, continued his studies on Infectious Lymphangitis, Nasal Granuloma, and Tuberculosis of cattle during the year and a paper of his on the first mentioned disease appeared as a Memoir in the Veterinary Series of the publications of the Department of Agriculture in India. Other minor investigations, some of very great interest, carried out by this officer are referred to in the Principal's report. 22. The separation of the Parasitological work from the Pathological section of the College Laboratory has already been referred to, and Mr. Panikkar has been placed tempo- rarily in charge of the former. He has initiated a few pieces of research work, but further subdivision of this section is necessary before any important results can be expected. 23. Mr. Anant Narayan Rao has obtained a new Cer- caria, the name given to the larval form of the flukes parasi- tic in domestic animals, from a mollusc found in a tank in Bellary district, and a paper on this subject is ready for the press. 24. As a result of conversations with Col. McCarrison, Director of the Deficiency Diseases Enquiry at Coonoor, an arrangement has been made for the members of this depart- ment to supply him with material from the domestic animals in connection with his enquiry into the cause of cystic calculi. IV.6 year. The number of outbreaks attended by the staff during the past year was greater therefore than the number of re- ports received by them in 1926Plate No. 2 A VILLAGE IN BELLARY DISTRICT STRICKEN WITH RINDERPEST.

7 32. The total number of inoculations performed against Rinderpest by the serum alone method, was 184,798 as com- pared with 181,781 in the previous year, and as this method appeared to be having very little effect in checking the dis- ease a special effort to introduce the simultaneous method of inoculation on a comparatively large scale was made in the early part of 1928, at which time of the year cultivating ope- rations are not being carried on to any extent. Muktesar be- ing so far away, virus was obtained either locally or from the Mysore Civil Veterinary Department, to whom our best thanks are due, and by the end of the year under report 6.182 bovines and 46 other animals had been protected by this method, and of these only 9 animals died after inoculation. Messrs. Sampath Ayyangar, Kailasam Ayyar, Anant Narayan Rao and A. Ramachandra Ayyar are to be commended on the enthusiasm which they showed in this campaign. 33. From last year's report it appears that the chief diffi- culties in the way of increasing the number of animals pro- tected by this simultaneous method in the past have been the sentimental objections of the ryots and the lack of highly trained officers. The first obstacle appears to be disappear- ing naturally, for it is stated that in many places the ryots will not have serum alone, but ask for the simultaneous method. Quite a number of the senior members of the sub- ordinate staff have now had sufficient experience in the field to be able to supervise these inoculations with success and a scheme has been submitted to Government for a considerable increase in the supervising staff of the department, so that a real effort may be made to control this and the other con- tagious diseases of cattle, which stand so much in the way of the prosperity of the ryot. 34. Hæmorrhagic septicæmia.8 with anti-serum was undertaken in nine outbreaks when 769 animals were protected against 1,669 in the previous year. 36.

9 43. Trypanosomiasis.10 52. The private building in which the Veterinary dispensary at Pollachi has been located for some time was acquired by Government during the year, and the dispensaries at Chica- cole and Kavali were also moved into Government buildings. Structural improvements, which will render them more effi- cient, were carried out to the hospitals at Ootacamund, Coimbatore, Calicut, Ellore and Madura. 53. Thanks to the efforts of Mr. Souter, the Collector of Vizagapatam, the question of transferring the District Board buildings of the Vizagapatam Veterinary hospital to Govern- ment, which has been under correspondence since 1922, has been amicably settled. In the same way the Collector of Tanjore has, it is hoped, finally arranged for the acquisition of a suitable site for the proposed Veterinary hospital at Negapatam, after twelve years of correspondence. 54. The total number of new cases admitted to Veterinary institutions for treatment during the year was 125,762, while the number of cases supplied with medicines but not brought to the institutions rose from 4,923 to 7,387. The leading institutions in the Presidency with the number of cases admitted by each, were as follows:[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Plate No. 4 CHINGLEPUT VETERINARY DISPENSARIES DURING THE WORK HOURS.
11 October 1927 it was decided that the 34 men, who had been attached to Veterinary institutions as second Assistants, should revert to the old method of doing twenty days touring a month, and run camp dispensaries in large villages for about ten days at a time. 57. The total number of cases treated by this itinerating staff during the year was 60,290 of which 27,449 were non- contagious. (c) Castration. 58. The total number of castrations performed by the staff during the year was 8,521 against 8,290 in 1926-27 : of these 4,553 were done by the itinerating staff and 3,968 in Veterinary institutions. Of the later, 1,396 were per- formed at the institutions in Ganjam district alone. 59. The number of castrations is small when compared with the figures from some of the other provinces, but it is hoped that when the large indent for Burdizzo castrators, which has recently been made, is complied with, this very necessary operation will be performed in much larger num- bers on the many " scrub " bulls which exist in this province. The high pressure at which most of the touring staff has had to work in connection with Rinderpest no doubt accounts in part for the smallness of the figures in the last few years. VI.12 Veterinary hospitals for treatment, and of this number 1,441 were cases convicted in Coimbatore district alone. It appears therefore that while the society's agents are sufficiently active in Trichinopoly district, it is only in Coimbatore district that the Bench Magistrates are exercising their powers in a proper manner. This point has been brought to the notice of Government many times before. 62.

In addition to the above, two paying students, one from the Federated Malay States and the other from Ceylon, were admitted during the year. 8. As some of the students selected did not arrive at the college and as some who joined left it in a few days, some additional students were subsequently taken in to make up the deficiency in numbers. The strength of class A at the end of the year was only 38 including the 6 failed students from the previous year. 9. The total number of students in the college on 31st March 1928 was 86 of whom 36 were Brahmans, 33 non- Brahmans, 9 Muhammadans, 7 Indian Christians and 1 Anglo- Indian. 10. Professional examinations.17 13. All the eight candidates presented themselves for the examination and all of them except the one private student from the Federated Malay States were successful in passing the examination and obtaining the certificate issued by the college. 14. The Board of Examiners made the following remark :18 IV.19 26. It is interesting to note that the nine smears confirmed for tuberculosis include one said to have been made from the sputum of an elephant belonging to the Coorg Forest Depart- ment. Acidfast bacilli indistinguishable from tubercle bacilli were detected in this smear. 27. It has also been found, during the systematic examina- tion of blood smears of calves used for the Rinderpest camp opened at the college, that theileriasis is quite common among the calves of this Presidency. 28. Sixty-two samples of hides and skins were examined during the year for the issue of certificates of freedom from Anthrax and of these twelve were found to be infected. 29. Post-mortem examinations were, as a routine, con- ducted on all the different classes of animals that died in the college and also on those that were received from outside, and they supplied ample material for practical instruction to students and in some cases for preservation in the college museum as well as for the purposes of investigation. During the year these numbered 121. The infection of spirocerca sanguinolenta and the occurrence of Cysticercus cellulosæ in dogs, Cirrhosis of the liver in dogs, Tuberculosis amongst the cattle of the Corporation and Atheroma of the aorta in cattle were some of the more important conditions met with in these post-mortems, and papers on some of these conditions are awaiting publication. 30. Requisitions for the supply of vaccines for the treat- ment of cases of Bovine Lymphangitis and other chronic suppurative affections were during the year received from the staff of the Civil Veterinary Department. The total number of cases for which vaccines were supplied was 70 ; of this number 62 were for the treatment of Bovine Lymphangitis. V.20 1928. In all, 1,968 animals were inoculated against the disease by the serum alone method. 34. There were, during the year, some sporadic cases of Anthrax in the Corporation Cattle Depot at Choolai and in the dairy farm of the Buckingham and Carnatic Mills, and 26 animals of the former were inoculated against the disease.

The animal gradually improved in condition with the treatment and the clinical symptoms showed a decided abatement, but examination of her rectal washings made from time to time continued to show Johne's bacilli. The animal was eventually destroyed and post-mortem examination showed definite lesions of the disease. 40. Outbreak of poultry disease in Tanjore.22 44.

25 Surgeons at Bhadrachalam, Vizagapatam, Parvatipur, Pala- konda, Tekkali, Narasapatam and Koraput. Non-detail inspection of the Veterinary institutions at Polavaram, Rajah- mundry, Amalapuram and Bobbili and the office of the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Amalapuram, has been done by me. The Veterinary institutions at Russellkonda and Berham- pur and the offices of the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons at Russellkonda, Aska and Berhampur were not inspected during the year for want of time, as I was engaged in serum simultaneous inoculation against Rinderpest practi- cally from the middle of November to the end of the official year under report. 6. The Government livestock at Koraput, Parvatipur, Narasapatam, Samalkot, Anakapalle, Polavaram and Bhadra- chalam have been inspected during the year. I also visited Razole to find out whether it was a suitable place for opening a Veterinary dispensary. 7. During the year, 1,994 animals were inoculated by serum simultaneous method against Rinderpest in this circle. Of these, 140 belonged to the Raja Sahib of Parlakimedi, 19 to the Government Agricultural Farm at Anakapalle and the rest, namely, 1,835, belonged to the ryots in East Godavari district. The virus was obtained from Muktesar for inoculating the animals at Parlakimedi and Anakapalle and the local virus was used for inoculating the remaining animals in East Godavari district. 8. I have also attended the Veterinary hospital at Vizaga- patam very often and attended some outbreak reports of Rinderpest in East Godavari district along with the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons concerned. II.26 (a) Hospitals and Dispensaries. 10.

The Raja Sahib contributes Rs. 660 annually towards the maintenance of the hospital. 14. The Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge of the Veterinary hospital, Cocanada, has attended to the animals of the Government Agricultural Farm, Samalkot, whenever there was a call from the farm and the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge, Veterinary dispensary, Anakapalle, has attended the Government elephants stationed at Narasapatam once. 15. The Veterinary Assistant Surgeons in charge of the Veterinary institutions at Russellkonda, Chicacole, Bobbili, Anakapalle and Kothapeta were exempted from touring work. 16. The second Veterinary Assistant Surgeons attached to the institutions at Berhampur, Vizagapatam, Cocanada, Rajah- mundry and Amalapuram were asked to work as Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons as before. (b) Itinerating. 17. On the 31st March 1928 there were 16 Touring Veteri- nary Assistant Surgeons attached to this circle. The head- quarters of the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Jami, was transferred to Vizianagaram so that he may attend the hospital when at headquarters. 18. A comparative statement of work done by the touring staff during 1926-27 and 1927-28 is given below :28 III.29 26. Foot-and-mouth disease.30 37. Malicious injury.31 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE II CIRCLE, CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BEZWADA, FOR THE YEAR 1927-28. I.32 II.33 (b) Touring Staff 14. Owing to the revival of the old system of touring work from 1st October 1927, the Second Veterinary Assistant Surgeons who were attached to Veterinary institutions at Nellore, Guntur, Bezwada, Gudivada, Bandar, Nuzvid and Ellore and who were attending only to outbreak reports were again required to do 20 days' touring as before. The head- quarters of the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons, Atmakur, Tenali, Gudivada and Tadepalligudem were changed to Buchireddipalem, Bapatla, Jaggayyapet and Bhimavaram respectively. Touring billets of Gudur, Kanigiri, Kandukur, Vinukonda and Tiruvur remained without change as in the previous year. The Veterinary Assistant Surgeons in charge of Veterinary institutions, Ongole, Narasaraopet and Palakole were exempted from touring work as the daily average attendance of these institutions was more than 15. 15. The additional Veterinary Assistant Surgeons posted during 1926-27 owing to prevalence of Rinderpest with head- quarters at Rapur, Allur and Butchireddipalem continued to work till 26th April 1927, 24th May 1927 and 12th July 1927 respectively. 16. Castrations.34 21. The names of the following Veterinary Assistant Surgeons have been noted for their good work:35 29. Epizootic lymphangitis.36 43. Municipal.37 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE III CIRCLE, CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BELLARY, FOR THE YEAR 1927-28. I.38 6. The Government animals at Hagari and Nandyal were inspected by me and serum simultaneous inoculations were conducted on the animals belonging to the agricultural farm in the former place. 7. In all the villages visited by me, opportunity was taken in explaining to them the working of the Veterinary depart- ment and the advantages of the modern veterinary methods of treatment. II.39 16. There is an increase in the total number of cases treat- ed in all the Veterinary institutions in this circle excepting in those at Nandyal, Hindupur and Harpanahalli. In the latter place there was an outbreak of plague and the people were ordered to evacuate the town for over three months, hence the fall in the number of cases treated. 17. The number of cases treated at the Veterinary dispen- saries at Proddatur and Koilkuntla are not many when com- pared with other institutions; these were opened late in 1020 and it is hoped that both these institutions will show more work in the ensuing year. 18. The second Veterinary Assistant Surgeons attached to the Veterinary institutions at Nandyal, Adoni, Harpanahalli, Chittoor, Madanapalli and Cuddapah were asked to tour for 20 days in a month, selecting two centres, wherein propa- ganda work could be done. This change of policy was given effect to from 1st November 1927. 19. The Veterinary Assistant Surgeons in charge of Vete- rinary dispensaries Kurnool, Koilkuntla, Hospet, Anantapur and Hindupur were exempted from attending the outbreak reports of their respective taluks. The Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge of Proddatur and the Veterinary Assist- ant Surgeons in charge of the new dispensaries at Badvel and Rajampet were asked to attend to the outbreak reports of their taluks, with a view that the opening of a Veterinary dispensary at the taluk headquarters may be advertised more widely while on tour, when they could explain to the ryots the benefits they could get out of this department". (b) Itinerating Staff. 20. No new touring billets were opened during the year under review. The offices of the Touring Veterinary Assist- ant Surgeons, Nandikotkur, Kalyandrug, Kudligi, Proddatur, Rajampet and Harpanahalli were closed and their headquarters were changed to Kurnool, Anantapur, Hospet, Jammalama- dugu, Rayachoti and Hadagalli respectively during the year under the change of policy (rearrangement of touring work). The Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons Penukonda, Nan- dikotkur, Kalyandrug, Kudligi and Nandyal were asked to attend to the outbreak reports of Hindupur, Kurnool, Ananta- pur, Hospet, Koilkuntla and Sirvel under the new scheme, in addition to the taluks they already had. 21. There is an increase in the number of cases treated by the touring staff for contagious diseases and a slight fall in
40 the number of cases treated for non-contagious diseases and castrations performed when compared with the figures of last year. The fall is due mainly to the prevalence of Rinderpest and more time was spent in attending to outbreak reports; besides when some of the Touring Veterinary Assistant Sur- geons went on leave, such divisions had to be kept vacant for varying periods, when arrangements were made to attend to the outbreak reports in those places. III.41 first and to which place the cattle of the adjoining villages could be brought for immunisation, so that this system of protection could be spread around systematically. The vil- lagers would not agree to the proposal because they could not get fodder for their cattle in another village and it was not possible for them to carry it and store it in another village. The fodder problem in these districts is rather a hard puzzle to solve and at the same time the apathy and fatalistic ideas of the people are difficult things to overcome by argument in a short time. 27. There was not much opposition for the serum alone method of inoculation although in some villages of Ananta- pur, Gooty, Bellary and Alur taluks some difficulty was en- countered in convincing the people of the advantages. This was overcome by prosecuting about 43 persons who were fined by the concerned Magistrates under section 18 of the Madras Cattle Disease Act excluding 18 prosecutions of Alur, which are under trial with the Stationary Sub-Magistrate, Alur. 28.

Research.45 P. K. Rangesa Rao, T. M. Gangadhara Konar, P. A. Partha- saradhi, B. Hanumantha Rao and C. R. Chamaraj. Mr. Rama- chandran arranged the largest number of camps for these inoculations. The Tahsildar of Harpanahalli was good enough to arrange for the serum simultaneous inoculation camp there and at the same time helped this department in check- ing the movements of a herd of cattle infected with Rinder- pest belonging to Koracha cattle dealers. This has greatly helped in keeping the Mylar fair free from Rinderpest. 52. The Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge of the Veterinary hospital, Madanapalle, held two exhibitions in con- nexion with rural reconstruction work and the National Health Week. The touring veterinary assistant surgeons spoke to the people, whenever an opportunity presented itself, on the work done by this department and its advan- tages. It is hoped that better organized work in this direc- tion will be clone in the ensuing year. 53. Out of the total number of castrations done by the staff 508 were done by the Burdizzo castrator as against 288 of last year. There were four of these instruments in this circle during the year. I demonstrated the method of castra- tion by this instrument in some villages I visited. 54.

Proposals for the acquisition of the dispensary building at Palghat are under correspondence. 14. The second Veterinary Assistant Surgeon at the Veterinary hospital, Coimbatore, was relieved of his touring work as the average daily attendance was over 50. This institution will soon require a third hand to adequately cope with its growing work. 15. It is pleasing to be able to note that the hospitals and dispensaries in the circle have done very well indeed during the year. II.57 20. Of the 317 reports of this disease received as against 205 in the previous year, 285 were attended to by the staff. Of the remainder, some were pending attendance at the end of the year, and others not attended to, the outbreaks having subsided. 21. The Cattle Disease Act was in force throughout the year in the Nilgiris and in the Hosur taluk of Salem district. In Malabar the Act was in force as shown below:58 demonstration of the advantages of conferring lasting immuni- ty by the serum simultaneous method of inoculation in actual outbreaks. An outbreak of the disease within the municipal limits of Ootacamund afforded the opportunity of proving to the satisfaction of the owners of valuable herds that serum si- multaneous method of inoculation was by far the best solution of the problem of protection of cattle exposed to infection. And many of the cattle owners in and around Ootacamund sub- mitted their cattle for active immunisation. The success of this campaign was in no small measure due to the wholehearted co-operation and help rendered by Mr. Davis, the Municipal Chairman, and officers of the Health Department. 20. In order to enable this being done on an extensive scale, a circular embodying precise instructions for carrying out serum simultaneous inoculations in actual outbreaks was issued to the staff. 27. The question of suitable virus for these inoculations was easily solved by the promptness with which it was made available by post from the Mysore Serum Institute. And the number of outbreaks in which the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons were able to undertake these inoculations since then has more than fulfilled expectations. 28. It is highly desirable that the production and distribution of virus should be under our own control. I have had some little experience of a virus depot on a small scale in the Municipal Segregation Camp near the Kennels at Ootacamund in connection with the inoculations on the Nilgiris and I think it would be difficult to find a more suitable place for this purpose anywhere else in the Presidency. The advantages of having a virus depot of our own will more than repay the cost of its up-keep. 29. At the end of the year the number of inoculations done by the serum simultaneous method was 2,153, of which 1,902 were done in 15 outbreaks in the Nilgiris, Coimbatore and Malabar. There was only one mortality due to an animal in the incubative stage being inoculated. Experience has shown that most of the writers on the subject in the past have been unduly pessimistic and cautious to a fault. 30. It is hoped that this method of inoculation will, in course of time, replace entirely the serum alone method in combating Rinderpest.
59 31. At the time of serum simultaneous inoculation at the Hosur Cattle Farm, anti-rinderpest serum manufactured at the Mysore Serum Institute was used as a test on 13 country- bred cattle, viz., Schindi calves 8, Kangayam calves 4 and Delhi buffalo 1, and comparing the reactions shown it was found to be as effective as the class II special serum supplied from Muktesar. 32. Anthrax.60 38. Piroplasmosis.61 the institution for purposes of meat inspection. Mention has been made about this in the successive annual reports of this department. It seems that the desired object cannot be achieved unless an obligation is imposed by rule that meat inspection in municipal towns shall be done by a Veterinary Assistant Surgeon. 48.

I.63 Veterinary hospital, Madura, only for 12 days for the purpose of rendering professional aid to the Veterinary Assistant Sur- geon in charge. I was not able to attend frequently as I was engaged in serum simultaneous inoculation work. 5. The office of this circle was inspected twice during the year by the Veterinary Adviser to the Government of Madras. He also inspected a fixed serum simultaneous inoculation camp at Kattuputtur and a running camp at Sevandipuram. II.64 circle during this year was 18,860 and 407 as against 17,154 and 380 of the previous year. Of the 407 castrations done at the institutions, 52 had been performed by Burdizzo Castrator. An increase in the number of cases supplied with medicine but not brought to the institutions has been observ- ed65 non-contageous cases treated and the number of castrations performed. The fall in both the cases is due to the severity of Rinderpest in this circle; besides, when some of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons went on leave the places had to be kept vacant for a long time for want of leave reserve hands, although arrangements had been made to attend out- break reports in their jurisdiction. Of the 715 castrations performed, 482 were done by Burdizzo's Castrator. 13. The following Veterinary Assistant Surgeons helped me in conducting serum simultaneous inoculations in three fixed camps, (viz.), Courtallam and Ravanasamudram of Tinnevelly district and Kattuputtur of Trichinopoly district, and in nine running camps, (viz.), Sevandipuram, Kulamanik- kapuram, Kodarangulam, Padmaneri, Keezhakaduvatti and Vijayanarayanam of Tinnevelly district and Naickarapatti, Periammapatti and Sivagiripatti of Madura district:66 It will be seen from the figures that there has been an increase in the outbreak reports of Rinderpest and Black quarter. 15.

It is found that the number of available veterinary graduates is hardly adequate for the requirements of the Presidency. There has, however, been a slight increase in the number of students admitted to the College, and with the increase from 15 to 40 of the number of stipends tenable at the College sanctioned by Government recently, it is hoped that a greater number of students will be passing out of the College in future and that veterinary graduates will be available in greater numbers hereafter. Similarly with the recent grant of the increase in the strength of leave reserve it is expected that it would be possible for a greater number of veterinary assistant surgeons being deputed annually to undergo the post- graduate course. The question of appointing a Proto Zoologist is also under consideration. Government note with pleasure the testimony borne by the Director, Civil Veterinary Department, to the good work done in the field of research in the College. They are also pleased to observe that an improvised Parasitological section has been formed and that attempts are being made to supply large quantities of rinderpest virus. The Royal Commission on Agriculture have placed special stress on the importance of the Veterinary Department in the agricultural development of the country, and it is hoped that the recommendations of the Royal Commission will be given effect to very early so that the activities of the department both on the side of research and administration are materially increased. 7. In conclusion, the Government note with satisfaction the enthusiasm and ability displayed by Mr. P. Ware, the present Director, Civil Veterinary Department, ever since he took charge of the department, and trust that the comprehensive scheme of development and expansion of the department which he is at present inaugurating will be carried through with sustained effort to its fruition.

I.2 August 1928 and was subsequently posted as Assistant Profes- sor and Personal Assistant to the Principal with effect from 14th August 1928. Mr. H. C. Sampath Ayyangar who was in charge of I Circle till 16th November 1928 took over V Circle on 24th November 1928 and he proceeded on leave from 24th March 1929. Messrs. R. Narasinga Rao, M. Anant Narayan Rao and A. Ramachandra Ayyar held charge of II, III and VI Circles respectively, throughout the year. 4. Mr. K. Kailasam Ayyar held charge of V Circle till 22nd August 1928 and during this period he went on privilege leave for one month from 18th April 1928. Later, he proceeded to the United Kingdom on combined privilege and study leave for nine months from 23rd August 1928. Mr. A. J. Wilson held charge of the IV Circle till 23rd May 1928 when he went on leave for one month. On return from leave, he opened the new VII Circle and continued to hold charge of the Circle throughout the year except for one month and ten days when he was on leave. Mr. C. Venkataratnam Chetti held charge of I Circle for the last four and a half months of the year and Mr. W. J. D'Costa was in charge of IV Circle throughout the year except for one month and 23 days in the beginning of the year. Mr. K. S. Nair acted as Assistant Professor and Personal Assistant to the Principal till 13th August 1928 when he was posted to Coimbatore Circle, He rejoined duty at the College as Acting Professor of Surgery on 21st September 128. Messrs. A. K. Mitra and G. A. Ajwani were directly recruited to the Provincial Service and posted for training for a period of six months. (d) Subordinates. 5. The sanctioned cadre of Veterinary Assistant Surgeons on 31st March 1929 was 246 but only 239 were on the rolls on that date. The manner in which these men were employed is shown in table VII. During the year, eighteen new Veterinary Assistant Surgeons were entertained in the department. One Veterinary Assistant Surgeon who was dismissed was re-enter- tained under orders of Government. One Veterinary Assistant Surgeon resigned and another died during the year.

3 who conducted the examinations considered that the results of the examinations were satisfactory and that the students were well taught. The number of stipends granted was increased from 15 to 40 with effect from 1st July 1928. 7. The post-graduate course was held as usual for six months from July to December 1928. Six Veterinary Assistant Surgeons of this department and three from the Federated Malay States attended the course. Out of these nine candi- dates, six came out successful at the end of the course. 8. The Veterinary Hospital attached to the Madras Veteri- nary College showed a considerable increase in the total number of animals treated both as in-patients and out-patients, the figures being 830 and 2,371 respectively as against 768 and 1,969 of the previous year. During the year under report, the revised rates of admission fees were introduced in this hospital with effect from October and those for operations from February. According to these rates, people having an income of less than Rs. 200 per mensem will have their animals treated free at the Veterinary Hospital while those getting Rs. 200 and above a month will be required to pay fees. This has resulted in a marked increase in the number of cases that attended the Hospital even though a slight decrease in receipts was noticed. The branch dispensary at Rayapuram referred to in last year's Administration Report was opened during this year on the 14th January 1929. The number of admissions from this date till the end of the year was 119 and the average daily attendance for the period was 11.40. 9. The laboratory attached to the College continued to show satisfactory progress in all directions. The number of speci- mens received and examined during the year was more than double the number of the previous year. Authenticated cases of Tuberculosis in fowls were recorded for the first time in this Presidency in morbid materials from two fowls received at the laboratory. The production of rinderpest virus started towards the close of the last year was continued with the object of en- suring a regular supply of virus for carrying out serum simul- taneous method of inoculation against rinderpest in this Presidency. III.4 the causal organism of Bovine Lymphangitis was continued during the year and the various other items of research work done are explained in some detail in section VI of the College Administration Report appended.

5 enforced under the Madras Cattle Disease Act and the serum simultaneous method was resorted to in the majority of cases as a more effective weapon to combat this disease. This method of inoculation is becoming very popular with the ryots. 16. The total number of inoculations performed by the serum alone method against rinderpest showed a decrease, while that by the serum simultaneous method was decidedly much higher than it was in the previous year. The figures for serum alone and the serum simultaneous method of inoculations were 171,206 and 83,049, respectively, as against 184,798 and 6,228 of the previous year. 17. Rinderpest was raging in an epidemic form in most parts of the Presidency. The increased staff referred to in last year's report was sanctioned during the year. The amount originally allotted for the purchase of sera required for conduct- ing inoculations was insufficient and additional funds had to be provided during the year for meeting the heavy expenditure involved in combating this disease. Adequate provision of funds based on this year's experience has already been provided in the next year's budget and with the increased staff sanctioned by Government, it is hoped that the department will be able to afford much better protection to the cattle of the ryots against the ravages of this virulent disease than it has been possible to accomplish hitherto. 18.

The Royal Commission on Agriculture recently laid emphasis on maintaining a high standard of education at the Veterinary institutions of this country. Detailed proposals have accordingly been submitted to Government towards the end of this year to raise the standard of teaching at the Madras Veterinary College. The matter is now under consideration of the Government. 50. Research.Plate No. 5.

11 55. Propaganda.12 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE MADRAS VETERINARY COLLEGE FOR THE YEAR 1928-29. I.13 II.14 years, having expired on 23rd March 1929, proposals were submitted for the re-constitution of the Committee during the year and the orders of Government are awaited. (c) Scholarships.15 examination was held at the end of the course from 19th December 1928 to 21st December 1928 by an Examining Board, the members of which were :16 During the year under report the brains of 42 dogs, two calves, one horse and one cat were sent to the Pasteur Institute Coonoor, for microscopical examination, and of these, 34 were reported to be positive, 8 inconclusive, and 4 unfit for examination. The following statement shows the major and minor operations performed in the hospital during the year :17 (b) Rayapuram Dispensary.18 The following table gives the number of specimens confirmed microscopically for the several diseases:19 The infection of spirocerca sanguinolenta in dogs, especially in the foxhounds of the Madras Hunt, and cirrhosis of liver in dogs formed some of the important conditions met with in these post-mortems. Vaccines.20 The following table shows the classified list of specimens received and examined during the year :21 and the Clinical Laboratory and of these 120 were positive. The following are the parasites recorded :22 (C) Clinical Laboratory. A Clinical Laboratory was opened from 9th July 1928 with a view to facilitate the immediate examination of smears and scrapings, etc., received from the different wards of the college and in order to give practical training to the final year students in the examination of such materials. Work in this section is done in the morning hours only. The Senior Laboratory Assistant working in the Parasitological section was in charge of this laboratory. For the sake of convenience and to avoid repetition the specimens examined in this laboratory have been shown with those of the Parasitological section. V.23 Presidency. So far the parasite seems to be harmless. With a view however to find out a suitable drug to cleanse the blood of this parasite, drug treatment was adopted in some cases and the results show that trypanblue (both Casella and Merck) is of no value for this purpose. Trypanosoma theilerii.24 Research so far made indicates that the causal organism of bovine lymphangitis is very closely allied to B. pestis. Lesions quite identical with those described by the Advisory Committee appointed by the Secretary of State for the investigation of plague in India as chronic or resolving plague lesions in rats were experimentally produced in guinea-pigs by inoculations into them of the organism of bovine lymphangitis as well as direct materials from natural lesions. An interesting piece of information was also gathered as regards the endemicity of this disease in the Madras Presidency. This was based upon the information furnished by the Deputy Superintendents of the Madras Civil Veterinary Department in 1918 to Mr. F. Ware, the present Director of Veterinary Services, Madras, in response to a circular issued by him then and also from the list of places from which materials have been received for examination from time to time between 192225 Experiments conducted with available materials have so far not revealed anything definite as regards the nature of the infection. (4) An outbreak among fox hounds of the Madras Hunt Club.26 in collaboration with the Director, King Institute, Guindy, and positive weak results were obtained in two of the cases. Owing to the heavy work entailed in this section further repetition of either of these tests or examination as to the elucidation of the cause of such abortions could not be proceeded with. VII.27 31st March the total number of specimens examined amounted to 4,021, while the number of post-mortems held on the car- casses of calves that died was 158. The quantity of virus drawn from each animal each time is given a separate number and a sample of each is subjected to strict examination for bacterial contamination before issue. From 1st October to 24th March 1929, 154,045 c.c. of virus were prepared which covered 258 brews of which 119,175 c.c. of virus were issued to the staff on their indents which numbered 506. An outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease occurred in one of the calves utilized for rinderpest virus production and in that connexion the issue of virus had to be stopped from 24th March 1929 until the close of the year. (b) Animal supplies. The number of animals purchased from 1st October to 31st March was 214 calves of which 78 were buffalo calves, one sheep and five goats, and the number that remained alive on the roll on 31st March in this section was one healthy buffalo calf and five others used for experiments with bovine lym- phangitis. VIII.28 the several features of the disease, relating to the mode of infection, spread and prevention. The whole story is illustrated by lantern slides prepared from photographs, most of them taken, of men who were made to act the different parts with suitable captions at intervals based on cinema lines. The preparation of charts, specimens and lantern slides depicting important cattle diseases met with in this Presidency and diseases communicable to man from animals were also proceeded with during the year. (b) Exhibitions and Shows. 1. As usual the College participated in the Health and Baby Week Show held in January when different exhibits of scientific and popular interest were arranged by the Professor of Pathology and his staff. Every evening a lantern show was held in front of the stall itself and popular lectures were given. 2. An exhibition showing the different pathological lesions of interest both from the medical and the veterinary point of view was held in the college laboratory when members of the Medical and Veterinary Research section of the last Indian Science Congress were invited to attend. In that connexion a lantern demonstration on anthrax was given to these members by M.R.Ry. V. Krishnamurti Ayyar Avargal, in the college central hall. IX.29 X.30 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE I CIRCLE, CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, VIZAGAPATAM, FOR THE YEAR 1928-29. I.31 Tekkali, Koraput, Vizianagram and Russellkonda. Non- detail inspections of the Veterinary institutions at Parvatipur, Polavaram, Berhampur, Russellkonda, Bobbili and Vizianagram and of the offices of the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons of Polavaram, Berhampur, Aska and Parvatipur have been done by me. I visited Jeypore and Grunupur to find out whether they were suitable for the opening of Veterinary dispensaries and selected buildings at Jeypore and Tekkali for the location of a Veterinary dispensary. I attended the Veterinary Hospital, Vizagapatam, almost daily during my stay at headquarters and rendered professional aid to the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge. When in camp every opportunity was taken to render similar aid to the staff and to demonstrate the use of Burdizzo castrator to them and to the ryots. 5. Mr. A. K. Mitra, Officer on probation in the Madras Veterinary Service, was posted to this circle to undergo train- ing under M.R.Ry. H. C. Sampath Ayyangar Avargal, who took him to Coimbatore, when he was transferred there. 6. During the year, 1,353 animals were inoculated by serum simultaneous method against rinderpest in this circle. II.32 Of the 1,768 castrations, 740 were done by the Burdizzo method. In addition, 2,327 cases which were not brought to the hospital, were supplied with medicines. The fall in the number of cases treated was due to the transference from this to the II Circle of the plain taluks of East Godavari, containing six important institutions, with effect from 1st July 1928. 11. There was an increase in the amount of work done in all the institutions except those at Polavaram, Russellkonda and Vizagapatam. The fall at the Veterinary Dispensary, Polavaram, was partly due to widespread outbreak of fire that took place at Polavaram early during the year, while the same in the Veterinary Dispensary, Russellkonda, was due to the prevalence of rinderpest in a virulent form in the taluk during the year. The decrease in the number of admissions at the Veterinary Hospital, Vizagapatam, was rather small. 12. As the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons in charge of the Veterinary institutions at Chicacole and Anakapalle, had not sufficient work to do at the institutions, they were asked to attend to outbreak reports of the taluks in which the institu- tions were located. (b) Itinerating. 13. On the 31st March 1928, there were twelve Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons attached to this circle. 14. No new touring billets were opened during the year. 15. The headquarters of the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Narasapatam, had to be shifted to Yellamanchili on 30th March 1929, as he could not get a house at Narasapatam to live in. 16. A comparative statement of the work done by the Touring staff during the years 1927-28 and 1928-29 is given below :33 and that some of the Assistants were engaged in serum simul- taneous inoculation camps. Further, some touring billets had to be kept vacant for want of leave reserve men. Of the 1,056 castrations, 281 were performed by Burdizzo castrator. III.34 In many instances the disease subsided with only a few deaths. No inoculations were conducted against this disease. 22. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia.35 convicted, while the accused in the other was discharged for want of evidence. No poison was found in the other two cases and they were thrown out by the magistrate. 35. Malicious injury.36 43. Out of the Municipal Councils of Chicacole, Parlakimedi, Bimlipatam, Anakapalle and Vizagapatam, which were reported to have adopted the by-laws relating to the control of contagious diseases of animals, those of Chicacole, Parlakimedi and Anaka- palle have opened cattle mortality registers and are giving effect to the by-laws. It was since reported on 30th April 1929 that a cattle mortality register had been opened by Vizagapatam Munici- pality and that measures were being taken for the adoption of the by-laws. Though the Municipality of Bimlipatam was reported to have adopted the by-laws, yet the Council expressed its unwil- lingness to open a cattle mortality register in that municipality. 44. In order to enable the Circle officers to carry on the serum simultaneous inoculations more intensely, they were provided during the year with personal assistants, but these posts were abolished from 1st April 1929, being considered to be unnecessary, as more circles would be opened during the year 1929-30. 45. The veterinary hospitals at Berhampur and Vizaga- patam were made the district headquarter hospitals and are now equipped with a microscope and other facilities for exami- nation of urgent microscopical specimens received from the staff of the district. 46. Office staff.--This office second clerk, K. Avatarachari, who had taken long leave with a view to better his prospects elsewhere, subsequently resigned the appointment and in his place H. Suryanarayana, permanent clerk in the II Circle office, Bezwada, now acting here, was confirmed. Consequent on the transfer of the permanent third clerk to the Medical College, Vizagapatam, another candidate with necessary qualifi- cations was appointed on probation for six months. The work of the staff including the personal assistant is satisfactory. The posts of the personal assistants were abolished with effect from 1st April 1929 and as such, considering the arduous nature of duties and responsibility of the head clerk, I recommend very strongly that his pay may be revised.

Office.49 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE IV CIRCLE, CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, MADRAS, FOR THE YEAR 1928-29. I.50 4. I selected buildings at Vellore for the location of the office of the VII Circle; inspected certain sites at Sembiam and Conjeeveram in regard to the opening of a new dispensary at the former and construction of permanent buildings at the latter; visited Tranquebar and Kodavalur with regard to ascertaining the suitability of the places for opening new dispensaries; and accompanied the Director of Veterinary Services to Chintaladevi Agricultural Farm in connexion with the investigation of contagious abortion among the farm animals. 5. I had the opportunity to attend the Seventh South Arcot District Co-operative Exhibition held at Vriddhachalam. I visited Pondicherry at the request of His Excellency the Governor of Pondicherry and discussed with the Members of His Government the ways and means of combating the outbreak of rinderpest in the Settlement. In response to a complaint received from the President of the Poonamallee Co-operative Milk Supply Society, Limited, that the hides shop in Poona- mallee was a source of spreading contagious diseases to the local cattle, I visited the shop and its vicinities and was satisfied that the complaint of the President was justified, and accordingly recommended the removal of the shop to a place outside the Cantonment limits. 6. As usual, I conducted the periodical inspection of the stationery, stores and furniture of the office of the Director of Veterinary Services. II.51 the severity of rinderpest throug hout the year. In the ease of Negapatam, the slight fall in out-patients was clue to the large exodus of families from Negapatam consequent on the removal of the South Indian Railway workshops to Golden Rock. The new dispensary at Nannilam has made a satisfactory start. 10. The number of cases not brought to the hospitals and dispensaries but supplied with medicines during the year rose from 297 of the previous year to 673. The large number of contagious cases supplied with medicines is responsible for the large increase under this item. 11. With regard to the conversion of certain dispensaries into hospitals, the sites selected for the Veterinary dispensaries at Tiruvalur and Chingleput have reached almost a definite stage in which the respective Collectors have been corresponded with for their opinion and appointment of site selection committees. In the case of Mayavaram and Conjeeveram, the matter is still under correspondence. 12. The additional duty of attending outbreak reports by the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons in charge of Tindivanam and Venkatagiri dispensaries was removed during the year as they were treating more than 15 cases a day on an average. Conse- quent on the prevalence of rinderpest on a large scale in Chingleput, South Arcot and Tanjore districts all the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons in charge of the Veterinary dispensaries in these districts, except Negapatam, were required to attend to the outbreak reports of the taluks in which the institutions are situated. The Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge, Veteri- nary Dispensary, Tiruvalur, who was also attending to outbreak reports, was subsequently exempted from touring work as the attendance of cases at the institution was over 20 daily and he had in addition to attend to meat inspection work. (b) Touring Establishment. 13. As it stood on 31st March 1929, the touring staff were 17 in number, of whom two were attached to the institutions at Saidapet and Kumbakonam as Second Veterinary Assistant Surgeons. 14. A comparative statement of the cases treated and castrations performed by the touring staff is furnished below:52 The total number of castrations performed during the year is 1,169 as against 1,186 of the previous year. Of this number, 641 were performed by the Burdizzo method. The Touring staff are responsible for 292 castrations and the remaining castrations were performed at the several institutions in the circle. The decrease in the number of castrations was due to the Touring staff being otherwise engaged in inoculation work. III.53 gypsies left the place, the carcase left behind was skinned and the remains were scattered about on the grazing grounds by the villagers, which caused the outbreak of the disease in that taluk. 17. The proposal of the Royal Commission on Agriculture relating to inoculations by serum-simultaneous method agaiust rinderpest in actual outbreak reports in preference to the serum- alone method was given effect to in this circle with very encouraging results. More inoculations by this method could have been performed if the supplies of serum and virus were regular and continuous. 18. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia.54 27. Avian tuberculosis.55 36. The care of the two breeding bulls of the Agricultural department stationed at the Veterinary dispensaries at Maya- varam and Conjeeveram was handed over to this department during the year. 37.

I.58 at the Wellington Dairy Farm, and inspected a pony at Telli- cherry and declared it to be a case of 'Surra'. He continued to visit the headquarters hospital frequently, and also attended the departmental "Provincial Officers' Conference held in Madras in August 1928. 4. Mr. W. J. D'Costa was on tour for 21 days; inspected the Veterinary dispensary, Pollachi; visited Palayakottai, and arranged for black-quarter inoculation there, and actively immunised some Government cattle at the Hosur Farm. 5. M.R.Ry. K. S. Nayar Avargal toured for 13 days; investi- gated an outbreak of Foot-and-mouth disease at Ootacamund and Coonoor; conducted serum-alone method of inoculation against Rinderpest on the animals at the Wellington Dairy Farm; inspected the Veterinary institutions at Palghat and Tiruppur, and inspected the veterinary dispensary building and adjoining sites proposed to be acquired. He visited the local hospital, while at headquarters. 6. M.R.Ry. T. S. Alagappa Pillai was on tour for 11 days and inspected the field work of the touring Veterinary Assist- ant Surgeon, Tiruppur and Erode, and that of the additional Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Satyamangalam; and conducted serum-simultaneous inoculations against Rinderpest at Tholam- palayam in Coimbatore district. His name was gazetted only in the month of November, hence he could only tour for a few days. 7. M.R.Ry. H. C. Sampath Ayyangar Avargal, spent 72 days in camp, inspected in detail all the veterinary institu- tions, and touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons, except the touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons of Gudalur and Kollegal; conducted serum-simultaneous inoculations at the Agricultural College Farm, Coimbatore, and on the animals purchased by the Ceylon Government from the Pattagar of Palayakottai. He attended an outbreak of Rinderpest at the Ootacamund Municipality, and actively immunised the animals of the Municipal Dairy against Rinderpest. He attended a meeting of the officers of the Co-operative department at Erode; inspected the animals of the Nanjanad Potato Farm; treated Foot and Mouth cases at the Imperial Dairy, Wellington, with Lugols' solution of iodine. He also attended the annual cattle fair at Kulgunda in South Kanara district. He acted as a member of the Board of Examiners for post-graduate course examination held at the Madras Veterinary College. He visited the local veterinary hospital, while at headquarters and visited the veterinary hospital at the Agricultural College, Coimbatore. One horse was malliened at Cannanore dispensary by him, and the test was negative.
59 8. M.R.Ry. A. K. Mitra Avargal and M.R.Ry. T. S. Ala- gappa Pillai made no tour during the period they acted as Circle officers in March 1929. All the institutions and touring billets could not be inspected twice during the year in detail owing to the Circle Officers being engaged in organizing serum- simultaneous inoculation camps consequent on the prevalence of Rinderpest in this circle. A Personal Assistant was sanctioned to this office during the year and M.R.Ry. T. S. Alagappa Pillai was appointed and he joined duty on 13th June 1928. II.60 12. S.P.C.A.61 dispensary work. The post of the touring Veterinary Assist- ant Surgeon, Mangalore, though sanctioned last year, was filled only in January 1929 owing to want of hands. No new touring billet was sanctioned during the year. 23. A comparative statement of the cases treated and castra- tions performed on tour is given below. There has been an increase under each head during the year :62 30. In connexion with an outbreak of this disease in Oota- camund Municipality during February 1929, a hospital pound was opened within municipal limits in charge of the touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Ootacamund. He lodged a complaint with the Taluk Magistrate, Ootacamund, under section 4 of the Act against the owner of a sick animal for failure to give due notice. The result of the complaint is not known. 31. A notable feature in connexion with the control of Rinderpest during the year is that a comparatively largo number of inoculations by serum-simultaneous method was done. But for the failure of supply of serum on more than one occa- sion, the number of inoculations would have been larger still. 32. Additional touring men were posted temporarily at Valparai and Satyamangalam of Coimbatore district, and at Walluvanad of Malabar district to cope with the outbreaks. 33. Anthrax,63 died of other diseases within three months, and the others were reported to be doing well. The Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge of Veterinary dispensary, Tellicherry, reported that 15 patients64 47. Criminal poisoning.65 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE VI CIRCLE, CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, MADURA, FOR THE YEAR 1928-29. I.66 3. During the year under report 21,133 animals were protected by serum simultaneous method of inoculation against rinderpest. Of these, two animals belonged to the District Jail, Madura, six to the Kallar Agricultural Farm, Usilampatti, and 147 to the Trichinopoly Municipality, and the rest namely 20,978 animals belonged to the ryots. The virus for inoculation was obtained from Madras, Bangalore and Muktesar. Local virus was also used in some places. I have also attended some outbreak reports of rinderpest in Tinnevelly and Madura districts along with the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons concerned. While at headquarters I was able to attend the Veterinary Hospital, Madura (Thallakulam), only for four times and the Veterinary Dispensary, Madura City, on all days I halted at headquarters and rendered professional aid to the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons. II.67 8. Five hundred and forty castrations have been performed during the year under report as against 407 of the previous year. Out of the 540 castrations 222 were performed by the Burdizzo castrator. 9. There was an increase in the number of admissions, castrations and daily average in the veterinary institutions at Tinnevelly, Veerakeralampudur, Ramnad, Sivaganga, Kodai- kaual and Karur as compared with the previous year. An increase in the admission and daily average but a slight fall in castrations are observed in the veterinary institutions at Trichinopoly, Devakotta, Virudhunagar and Tuticorin. The decrease in the number of admissions, daily average and castra- tions in the Veterinary Dispensary, Rajapalaiyam, and Veterinary Hospital, Madura, was very perceptible when compared with the figures of the previous year. In the former, the fall is attributed to the fact that the animals were taken to the hills for grazing on account of the failure of monsoon, in the latter the decrease is said to be due to the opening of a branch veterinary dispen- sary in the centre of Madura City and also to the S.P.C.A. cases not being remanded to the infirmary for treatment during the year under report. The work in the Veterinary Institutions at Sivakasi, Periyakulam, Ariyalur and Madura City could not be compared as the former three were opened in the latter part of the previous year and the latter was opened on the 10th December 1928. 10. The Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge of the Veterinary Dispensary, Virudhunagar, has been attending to the animals of the Government Agricultural Farm at Koilpatti whenever there was a call for him from the Farm. 11. A temporary waiting shed and an operation shed have been constructed at the Veterinary Dispensary, Madura City, during the year under report. A small platform for dressing small animals has been put up at the Veterinary Hospital, Madura. Temporary sheds for S.P.C.A. cases have been constructed at the Veterinary Institutions at Devakotta, Ramnad and Rajapalaiyam. Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, P. S. Kuppuswami Ayyar, Do. K. Rajaratnam Pillai, Do. K. R. Lakshminarayana Ayyar, Do. S. Vaithianatha Mudaliyar, Do. G. Avoodanayagam Pillai, and Do. P. K Devanayakam Pillai deserve special mention for doing good work.
68 (b) Itinerating Staff. 12. There were twelve touring billets sanctioned for this circle and no new touring billets were opened during the year. 13. The touring billet of Sivaganga division remained closed throughout the year owing to paucity of hands. The touring billet of Ambasamudram division was kept vacant for about 6½ months on account of the permanent incumbent being posted to be in charge of the veterinary dispensaries at Sivakasi and Virudhunagar. Ariyalur division was also closed for a period of five months duo to the permanent incumbent being transferred elsewhere. The other Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons were attending to the outbreak reports of the above divisions in addition to their own whenever occasion arose. 14. A comparative statement of the work done by the touring staff during 1927-28 and 1928-29 is given below:69 III.70 There have been in all 29 deaths among the animals inoculated by serum simultaneous method. Of the 19 animals in column 5, two animals inoculated with virus containing Theileria Mutans died of natural causes, one died of Tympanitis, five died of Piroplasmosis and 11 died of Rinderpest. Out of the 11 animals that died of Rinderpest71 was severe and in the rest it was sporadic and mild. Two hundred and sixty-nine serum-alone method of inoculations against anthrax were carried out in Periyakulam division. 24. Foot and mouth.72 detected by the Chemical Examiner in one case and no arsenic was found in the other. The result in the former was not communicated and the latter case was thrown out. In one of the other two cases the animal was cured and discharged and the matter reported to the police and the second case, namely, an attempt to poison, ended in conviction. 35. Malicious injury.73 41. Fairs.74 (vi) In a few oases of Agalactia in cows, one per cent solution of Trypan blue in doses of 80 to 100 c.c. were injected intravenously by Veterinary Assistant Surgeon S. Vai- thianatha Mudaliyar. The results so far obtained are not quite encouraging. No definite conclusions can be arrived at now with regard to the efficacy of this drug in stimulating milk secretion. VI.75 on the advantage of early castration and the ryots realising the advantages, produced their young animals for castration. Burdizzo castrator was used whenever possible and the cattle owners welcome this method of castration. 47. Serum simultaneous method of inoculation was adopted when combating actual outbreaks. During a wide spread out- break efforts were concentrated on protecting the more valuable animals. The serum simultaneous inoculation is effective and readily accepted by cultivators. 48. Private efforts have been encouraged in all possible ways to supplement the efforts of Government in veterinary matters. The Pannayar of Rajapalaiyam. has promised to pay Rs. 3,000 for the construction of permanent buildings at Raja- palaiyam for the location of the veterinary dispensary. The founding of dispensaries has been commended to benefactors as an object worthy of support. The Municipal Council, Bodina- yakkanur, has undertaken to construct a pukka building for the location of a veterinary dispensary and hand it over to Grovermnent. VII.76 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OP THE VII CIRCLE, CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, FOR THE YEAR 1928-29. I.77 5. The Government Livestock at Hosur, Central Jail, Vellore, and Agricultural Farm, Kalahasti, have all been inspected and protected against rinderpest by the serum simultaneous method. 6. I served as an examiner in the B.Sc. (Agriculture) Degree Examination of 1929, the appointment having been offered by the Syndicate of the Madras University. 7. At the request of the S.P.C.A., Salem, I acted as a judge in all the items of exhibits at the animal show held there during the year. 8. I examined a police horse for further fitness for work at the request of the Principal, Police Training School, Vellore, and certified that it may be destroyed. 9. The Circle office has been inspected by the Director of Veterinary Services, Madras, during the year. II.78 13. The dispensary at Chittoor, which was till now in a rented building, is to be shifted early next official year to the new Government buildings, which are nearing completion. The institutions which have shown an appreciable increase in the number of admissions are Madanapalle, Ranipet, Chittoor and Hosur, though the increase at the last mentioned hospital deserves no congratulation but is due to severe outbreaks of rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease in the Farm. The fall under the same head is noticeable at Salem, Tiruvannamalai and Prodattur. It is hoped that the work at the first two institutions will improve with the recent change of hands. The work at Prodattur suffered on account of the heavy outbreak report duty which the Assistant had to attend to during greater portion of the year. The work at other institutions remained more or less the same and call for no remarks. (b) Itinerating Staff. 14. There were ten Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons in this circle at the close of the year. The posts of Namakkal and Jammalamadugu had to be kept vacant for a very long time for want of hands. Now that a dispensary is opened at Namakkal and the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge of it looks after the touring work of that taluk also, the question of moving the headquarters of the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeon of Namakkal to a more suitable place will be taken up in the coming year. A new touring billet is expected to be sanctioned by the Government daring the next official year. 15.

Order8 No. 1836, DEVELOPMENT, 28TH OCTOBER 1929 additional circles have been created and facilities afforded for the production of virus on a large scale at the Veterinary College, Gov- ernment hope that the serum-simultaneous method of inoculation will be resorted to on a very extensive scale and the disease brought under control during the current year. The Government are grati- fied to note that the owners of cattle are realizing the worth of the serum-simultaneous method of inoculation and are freely resorting to it, and that a definite start on propaganda work was made during the year by the preparation of charts, specimens and short stories illustrated by lantern slides to bring home to the public the im- portance of paying prompt attention to contagious diseases among cattle. 5. It is hoped that the comprehensive schemes of development and expansion of the department inaugurated during the current year will soon bear fruit and help to reduce cattle mortality appre- ciablv in future. 6. Government wish to place on record their high appreciation of Mr. Ware's strenuous efforts as head of the Veterinary Department in re-organizing the department and popularising the veterinary institutions.

ii CONTENTS PAGE VI. MiscellaneousANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE MADRAS CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT FOR THE YEAR 1929-30. I.2 the Advisory Board of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research, and the Board of Agriculture held at Pusa in December last. (b) Expansion of the Department. 4. In the last year's report a reference was made to the proposal for the creation of five additional circles. Prior to the year under report, the Presidency was, for purpose of Veterinary administration, divided into seven circles each in charge of an officer of the Madras Veterinary Service. In order, however, to allow district officers to devote more time to combat the severity of rinderpest, five additional circles were created during the year under report, and the jurisdiction and headquarters of the twelve circle officers were redistributed as shown below:3 the new Provincial Service on a scale of pay of Rs. 2504 Ayyar returned from the United Kingdom after the expiry of the combined privilege leave and study leave, and was posted to the College on 24th May 1929 as Acting Professor of Surgery and, later, was posted as Acting Resident Veterinary Officer and Personal Assistant to the Principal in place of Mr Panikkar. which post he continued to hold till the end of the year. Mr. A J. Wilson was in charge of the Vellore Circle from the beginning of the year till he was transferred as District Veterinary Officer, Coimbatore, on 4th September 1929 which post he continued to hold till the end of the year. Mr. M. R. V. Panikkar held the post of Assistant Professor and Personal Assistant to the Principal, Madras Veterinary College, and Resident Veterinary Officer from the beginning of the year till 1.8th August 1929, when he was posted as Acting Professer of Medicine. Mr. M. Anantanarayan Rao was attached to the Bellary Circle at the commencement of the year. He was posted to the Coimbatore Circle on 10th April 1929 and he held that post till 15th August 1929, when he proceeded to the United kingdom on combined leave on average pay and study leave. Mr. A. Ramachandra Ayyar continued to hold charge of the Madura Circle throughout the year. Mr. K. 8. Nayar was Acting Professor of Surgery, Madras Veterinary College, from the beginning of the year till 21th May 1929 when he was granted leave. He was reposted to the College with effect from 3lst May 1929 as Acting Professor of Pathology and Bacteriology and was subsequently appointed as Acting Pro- fossor of Surgery from 19th August 1929. He continued to hold this post till the end of the year. 9. Mr. W. J. D Costa who was Acting District Veterinary Officer, Madras, in the beginning of the year was posted to open the new Trichinopoly Circle on 12th June 1929, and he held charge of the same Circle till the end of the year. Mr. A. K. Mitra held independent charge of the Bellary Circle from 3rd April 1929 to the end of the year, and Mr. C. Venkataratnam Chetti continued to hold charge of the Vizagapatam Circle throughout the year. Mr. G. A. Ajwani opened the Madana- palle Circle on 10th July 1929 and held independent charge of this Circle till the end of the year. Mr. A. L. N. Somayajulu Pantulu, who was in charge of the Madras Circle from 4th June 1929 to 14th June 1929, opened the new Nellore Circle on 15th June 1929 and continued to hold charge of it till the end of the year. Messrs. C. Suryanarayanamurthi and T. S. Alagappa Pillai opened the Rajahmundry and Culicut Circles respectively on 1st August 1929 and held charge of the same till the end of the year.
5 (f) Madras Veterinary Subordinate Service. 10. The sanctioned cadre of Veterinary Assistant Surgeous on 31st March 1930 was 254, but only 251 were on rolls on that date. The manner in which these men were employed during the year under report is shown in table VII. Eighteen new Veterinary Assistant Surgeons were entertained in the department during the year. Two Veterinary Assistant Sur- geons died and one resigned his appointment during the year, hut his resignation has not yet been accepted pending the refund of the amount of tuition fees and the stipend drawn by him while undergoing the course at the Madras Veterinary College. M.6 Veterinary Assistant Surgeons attending the course should receive certificates to the effect that they have undergone the course but without any indication of their success or failure at the examination, and that certificates in the usual form show- ing success or failure at the examination should be issued in the case of private students attending the course. 16. The Veterinary Hospital attached to the Madras Veterinary College continued to work satisfactorily during the year. There was an increase in the total number of cases treated during the year as compared with that of the previous year, the figures for the years 1928-29 and 1929-30 being 3,201 and 3,558 respectively. There has been a slight fall in the hospital receipts which is attributed to the introduction of the revised scales of foes referred to in the last year's report. 17. The branch dispensary for out-patients at Rayapuram which was opened about the end of the last year, made good progress during the year under report. The total number of admissions at this dispensary during the year was 1,369 while the average daily attendance for the year was 23.00. Ten cases from this dispensary were sent to the Madras Veterinary College during the year for major operations or special treatment. The laboratory attached to the College continued to show satisfactory progress during the year under report. The staff of Veterinary Assistant Surgeons attached to the Pathological section of the laboratory was increased by three during the year under report. There was a considerable increase in the number of specimens received and examined during the year, over that of the previous year, the figures for the two years 1928-29 and 1929-30 being 9,411 and 15,712 respectively. Two items of particular interest were the finding of Rhinosporidiosis in a horse and a positive reaction to B. abortus Bang, both of these for the first time. The production of rinderpest virus was continued in the Pathological section of the laboratory and 467,675 c. cs. of virus were prepared. III.7 and but little was inaugurated on entirely new subjects. One new piece of work was, however, commenced on a disease of poultry, In their order Mis. No. 527, Development, dated 25th March 1929, Government sanctioned the Director's proposal for conducting certain experiments at the Madras Veterinary College for the manufacture of a Bacteriophage for use against Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia and sanctioned an expenditure of Rs. 2,075 for the purpose. The experiments could not, how- ever, be conducted during the year under report, as the Professor of Pathology and Bacteriology could not spare sufficient time for the purpose owing to the fact that he acted as Principal. IV.8 21. Rinderpest.9 25. Anthrax.10 Outbreaks of Pseudo-fowl pest among poultry and birds were reported during the year from the Madras, Coimbatore, Madura, Rajahmundry and Bellary circles and in Madras City. The mortality was particularly heavy in Madras City. where the cause of the outbreak was taken up for investigation by M.R.Ry. K. Kailasam Ayyar and certain transmission experiments were carried out by him. A study of the lesions set up artificially with infective materials was made and experiments regarding the suitability of using liver and spleen emulsion as a means of immunising are being carried out. 34.

11 38. The loading institutions in the Presidency with the number of eases admitted by each were as follows:12 42. Society for the Prevention of Cruelly to Animals.13 slides, charts and diagrams on vaterinary matters for propa- ganda work have been prepared and steps were taken to make suitable lantern slides depicting parasitic diseases. As usual, the department participated in the Health and Baby Week shows and exhibited various items of popular and scientific interest. Advantage was taken of cattle fairs and exhibitions to conduct magic lantern demonstrations and popular lectures. Leaflets on some of the important diseases of animals prevalent in the Presidency continued to be distributed free to the ryots. 47. In the previous year's report a reference was made to the proposal for the equipment of a motor laboratory with a view to familiarising the ryots in veterinary matters. While negativing this proposal Government directed that the motor vans maintained by the Agricultural department should be utilized for the purposes of propaganda work of this department. This is not, however, an entirely satisfactory arrangement, but attempts are being made to make use of the agricultural van in certain places to conduct lectures and to give demonstrations. Since the close of the year, the Principal, Madras Veterinary College, has been asked to prepare duplicates of most of the existing slides for supply to the District Veterinary officers for propaganda work in co-operation with the agricultural motor vans. 48. Fairs and shows.14 50. Levy of fees at veterinary institutions.15 VIII.16 58. Veterinary sera and vaccines intended for the use of this department are at present stored in the cold storage at the King Institute, Guindy. In view of the large increase in the requirements of serum for anti-rinderpest work and the insufficiency of accommodation at the King Institute definite proposals have been submitted to Government for the establish- ment of a cold storage plant at the Madras Veterinary College to stock sera and vaccines and the orders of Government on these proposals are awaited, 59. Propaganda.17 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OP THE MADRAS VETERINARY COLLEGE, FOR THE TEAR 1929-30. I.18 Mr. Raman Menon, a Veterinary Inspector from Cochin deputed to this College by the State during last year to he trained in the serum simultaneous method of inoculation against Rinderpest left the College during the early part of this year after finishing his training. Mr. Y. Thambi was deputed during the year to the College by the French Government for acquiring some practical knowl- edge in Veterinary Science. He joined the College on 1st October 1.929 but discontinued his studies on 27th January 1930. II.19 In addition to these forty, three more were provisionally- selected at Bezwada and two at Madras and these were placed in the waiting list to fill in any vacancies that might arise among the students selected. Of the forty students, one from each of those selected at Bezwada and Madras discontinued as soon as they joined the College and their places were filled from the waiting lists. In the course of the year, four students discontinued their studies. Nine of the students that failed in the first year class during the previous year were allowed to continue in the same class. Four paying students20 In the first and second year classes the students were trained to record their practical observations made in the course of study in the different subjects and this record was inspected by the Principal. (d) Professional examinations.21 Through the courtesy of the Superintendent of the Imperial Institute of Animal Husbandly and Dairying, Bangalore, practical demonstration of the various dairy processes and the methods of milking, collecting, pasteurizing and distribution of clean milk was given to the students Opportunity was also taken to demonstrate the work done at the Experimental station for Animal Nutrition. The Mysore Serum Institute was also visited and the Officer in charge kindly arranged for a demonstration of the technique of anti-rinderpest serum production. Although the time allotted for the excursion was very short, the value of the practical knowledge acquired by the students has been very useful. It would enhance the usefulness of the training if such excursions were undertaken as a regular feature of the post-graduate course every year. The usual examination was held at the end of the course from the 16th to 20th December 1929 by a Board consisting of 22 Ayyar Avargal, when M.R.Ry. Rao Bahadur Dr. A. Laksh- manaswami Mudaliyar Avargal delivered an interesting address on "Medicine and its relation to Veterinary Science". A cinema demonstration on the National Horse Breeding industry in India was given on that occasion by the Acting Principal. III.23 (b) Fees.24 Ten cases which attended this dispensary were subsequently transferred to the Madras Veterinary College for further treat- ment. Thus this institution has been acting as a feeder to the Madras Veterinary College Hospital, by providing cases both for major operations and for special treatment. IV. 25 The following table gives the numbers of specimens con- firmed microscopically for the several diseases and this excludes the routine smears from the Rinderpest virus producers:26 Vaccine.27 The following table shows the classified list of specimens received and examined during the year including the Clinical Laboratory:28 The city was during the year free from any of the scheduled equine diseases. Rinderpest was prevalent in isolated areas in the Triplicane division during December 1929 and also in some of the Corporation cattle depots. As the serum simultaneous method of inoculation could not be conducted in view of the difficulty of isolation and un- willingness on the part of the owners to keep the cattle off work during the period of immunization, the serum alone method of inoculation was resorted to and this had to be repeated at intervals until the disease abated. This had also to be resorted to in cases of cattle of the Corporation depots, in some cases owing to the difficulty of keeping them from work. Systematic immunization by the serum simultaneous method of inoculation of cattle belonging to the Madras Corporation and private bodies and owners was undertaken this year by the staff of the College but later during the year the work of immunizing cattle of the Corporation was taken over by the Corporation Veterinary Officer. Every assistance was, however rendered to this officer and he was also permitted to use the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals stable for the work. The total number of cattle protected against the disease by the serum alone method was 669 while by the serum simul- taneous method. 152. These figures include the animals belonging to the Madras Corporation immunized by the Corporation Veterinary Officer. Anthrax.29 VI30 of investigation a cow suffering from the disease was sent to the College for observation and report. The cow was kept under observation from 8th April 1929 to 21st April 1929 and on post-mortem it was found that the bladder showed numerous vil- lous-like outgrowths more prominently noticeable at the fundus. The appearance of the section cut from the growth was suggestive of carcinoma. 5. Poultry diseases.31 The animals used for virus production consisted of a buffalo and bull calves and the virulence of the virus was maintained by the alternation of passages between them. A sample of the virus manufactured at this laboratory was sent to the Director, Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research, Muktesar, at his request, and the report received from him showed that the virus was found to be virulent. Some difficulty was experienced in the matter of obtaining a regular supply of calves and to overcome this, trials were made of calves used as vaccine lymph producers at the King Institute, Guindy, after their discharge, for virus production. The results of observations recorded showed that they can be used with equal advantage and there has been no deterioration whatever in the potency of virus, provided suitable alternations of pas- sages were made from time to time. The majority of calves now used for the purpose are drawn from this source, while every now and then, as occasion demanded, calves were purchased locally. The calves are stationed in temporary thatched sheds and it is essential that more permanent accommodation capable of being thoroughly disinfected is provided as early as possible. It is hoped that this will be done in the near future. During the year under report, 467,675 c.c. of virus were prepared, which covered 577 brews, of which 383,700c.c. were issued to the staff on their indents, of which 1,595 were received. The presence of theileria mutans was detected in the blood of 158 calves out of 530 examined and with other inter-current affections in 33 more. No restrictions were imposed on the issue of theileria infected virus to the staff. Other inter-current infections such as resuscitation of piroplasma bigeminum either alone or associated with theileria or trypanosomiasis were found in 43 calves. Trypanosomiasis was detected in 16 and microfi- laria in 6 cases and these were not utilized for virus production. From 1st April 1929 to the end of the year, the total number of specimens examined for virus production amounted to 10,444 as against 4,021 of the previous year and 459 post-mortems were conducted on the carcases of calves. (b) Animal Supplies. The number of animals purchased from 1st April 1929 to 31st March 1930 was 548 calves of which 112 were buffalo calves, seven sheep and four goats. The number of calves that remained on the roll on 1st April 1930 was 18.

Of the two in leave reserve, one was on long leave and the other Veterinary Assistant Surgeon's services have been lent to the Raja of Kallikota. In addition to the above there were three probationers. M R.Ry. B. Lakshmanaswami Nayudu, Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, who was on long leave died during the year under report. (a) Hospitals and Dispensaries. 6. One veterinary institution was newly opened on 1st August 1929, at Jeypore during the year making the total number of institutions at the end of the year eleven including the two private ones. The institution at Jeypore is at present located in a rented building. 7. Government buildings for the Veterinary Dispensary at Parvatipur were constructed and the dispensary was moved to the new buildings on 13th January 1930. 8. The total number of cases treated and total number of castrations performed in the veterinary institutions of this circle were 12,628 and 1,682 as against 10,706 and 1,650 respectively of the previous year. Of the 1,682 castrations 1,099 were done by Burdizzo method. In addition 1,633 cases which were not brought to the institutions were supplied with medicines. 9. There was an increase in the amount of work done in all the institutions except those at Berhampur, Vizagapatam and Parvatipur. The fall at the Veterinary Hospital, Berhampur, was due to the following reasons :37 The decrease in the daily average attendance at the Veterinary Dispensary, Parvatipur, was rather small which does not require any explanation. 10. During the year under report the following additions and improvements were made or were under construction :38 The fall in the number of contagious cases treated is due to the fact, that some touring billets were left vacant for want of leave reserve men. Of the 767 castrations, 558 were performed by Burdizzo castrator. Narasannapeta division was removed from Chicacole taluk and added to the jurisdiction of the Touring Veterinary Assist- ant Surgeon, Tekkali, from 26th August 1929 for convenience of attending to the outbreak reports. Goomsur taluk was removed from the jurisdiction of the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Aska, on account of the opening of a new touring billet at Russellkonda on 2nd November 1929.

While at headquarters, the District Veterinary Officer visited the Veterinary Hospital, Rajahmundry, frequently to render help and to give advice in the treatment of animals. When in camp every opportunity was taken to render similar aid to the staff. 5. He selected a private building for the location of the Veterinary Dispensary, Peddapur, which was subsequently moved to a Government building and also the sites for the construction of permanent buildings for the veterinary institu- tions at Palacole and Draksharama. 6. He personally attended many outbreaks of rinderpest, conducted serum simultaneous inoculations at several places with local virus and with virus obtained from the Madras Veterinary College and demonstrated practically the use of Burdizzo Castrator to the ryots during his tours whenever opportunity occurred. 7. During the year under report, 19,165 animals were protected by the serum simultaneous method of inoculation against rinderpest. 8. The Circle Office was inspected during the year by the Director of Veterinary Services, Madras, who was pleased to remark that it was fairly well maintained. The Hon'ble the Minister for Development, Govern- ment of Madras, paid a visit to the Veterinary Hospital, Rajahmundry, on 27th November 1929 and was pleased to remark that it was doing good work. II.45 The work of the selection of the sites for the permanent buildings for the veterinary institutions at Palacole, Draksha- rama and Polavaram was proceeded with during the year but the final selection of the sites and their acquisition have yet to be done. 12. (a) The work of putting up of wire-fencing round the compound of the Veterinary Hospital, Cocanada, was commenced by the Public Works Department during the year. (b) Thatched operation sheds were put up at the veteri- nary dispensaries at Polavaram and Palacole. 13. The total number of cases treated and castrations performed during the year in all the institutions were 15,032 and 770 as against 14,733 and 395, respectively of the previous year. There was an increase of work done in all the institu- tions except those at Polavaram and Pithapuram where there was a fall. The fall at the latter was marked and was due partly to the widespread outbreak of fire in the town and partly to the frequent change of Veterinary Assistant Surgeons in charge of the institution. The fall at the Veterinary Hospital, Pithapuram, was slight and was due to the absence of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon from the hospital for a long time during the year. 14. Of the 770 castrations, 738 were done by the Burdizzo Castrator. The highest number done by this method at an institution, viz., 221 was at the Veterinary Hospital, Amala- puram. Next comes the Veterinary Dispensary, Kothapet, where 136 were done. This method of castration is, therefore, becoming very popular among the ryots. 15. The number of cases supplied with medicine but not brought to the institutions was 2,229 during the year. 16. Consequent on the prevalence of rinderpest in a severe form, during the year throughout the circle, the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons in charge of veterinary institutions were also instructed for some months, to attend to the outbreak reports of rinderpest, some within a radius of five miles from their headquarters, and, some in the taluk in which their institutions were situated. The Veterinary Assistant Surgeons in charge of veterinary institutions, Rajahmundry, Draksharama and Peddapur did more than a thousand inoculations each. (b) Itinerating Staff. 17. On the 31st March 1930, there were eight Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons attached to this circle . No new touring billets were opened during the year.
46 18. A comparative statement of the work done by the itinerating staff of this circle during the years 1928-29 and 1929-30 is given below :47 want of time or progress reports. The disease was prevalent throughout the circle and was very severe in West Godavari, where many cattle succumbed to the disease. 22. As the touring staff attached to this circle was found to be inadequate to attend to outbreaks of rinderpest, all the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons in charge of institutions were instructed to attend to outbreaks of cattle disease and carry out serum-simultaneous inoculations, some in the taluks in which the institutions were situated and, some within a radius of five miles from their quarters. Every endeavour was made by the staff to combat the disease, which was however, brought under control to a great extent towards the end of the year. 23. During the year, 19,165 animals (including 38 Government animals) were protected by serum simultaneous method against rinderpest. Of the total number of inoculations, 10,068 were done in West Godavari district and the remaining in East Godavari district. More inoculations could have been done, if the serum and virus had been always available. Among the 19,165 inoculations, there were only 6 casualties. 24. As the ryots in this circle except those in the Agency parts now understand the benefits of serum simultaneous inocu- lation and generally offer no opposition to it in villages, there was no necessity to enforce the Cattle Disease Act in any area during the year. 25. Anthrax.48 28. Foot and mouth disease.49 37. Malicious injury.50 The Government animals at the Agricultural Farms, Samalkot and Maruter, were attended to by the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons in charge of Veterinary institutions, Pedda- pur and Palacole respectively, and those of the Central Jail, Rajahmundry, by the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge of the Veterinary Hospital, Rajahmundry, whenever necessary. 42. Propaganda.51 46. Research.52 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF BEZWADA CIRCLE FOR THE YEAR 1929-30. 1. Mr. R. Narasinga Rao held charge of the II Circle consisting of three districts, viz., Kistna, West Godavari and Plains of East Godavari, till 31st July 1929, when five more circles were formed. West Godavari and Plains of East Godavari districts were added to Rajahmundry Circle and Guntur district to the present Bezwada Circle. For the remain- ing period of the year, i.e., from 1st August 1929 to the end of the official year, Mr. R. Narasinga Rao was in charge of the present Bezwada Circle consisting of Kistna and Guntur districts. He was on tour for 198 days. During the year under report, on the whole 20,317 cattle and 240 sheep were immunized against rinderpest by serum simultaneous method both by local virus and virus got from Madras Veterinary College. 2. All the veterinary institutions and the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons except Veterinary Dispensary, Nuzvid, and Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons, Nuzvid, Guntur and Bapatla, were inspected twice during the year. The Veterinary Dispensary, Nuzvid, was not inspected for a second time as the District Veterinary Officer was engaged in serum simultaneous inoculations. The Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons, Nuzvid, Guntur and Bapatla, were not inspected for a second time as the billets were vacant at the time of the District Veterinary Officer's tour in those places. 3. The District Veterinary Officer selected sites for the construction of permanent buildings for the veterinary institu- tions at Bezwada, Nuzvid, Gudivada and Bandar. 4. He visited the Veterinary Dispensary, Bezwada, almost daily during his stay at headquarters, examined the slides from cases and rendered help to the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons in operation and treatment of cases when necessity arose. 5. Mr. G. A. Ajwani underwent training till 17th July 1929 afternoon, when he was transferred to Madanapalle Circle as District Veterinary Officer. II.53 (a) Hospitals and dispensaries. 7. The number of in and out-patients treated and castrations performed at all the institutions in this circle were 12,189 and 282, respectively as against 12,316 and 254 in the previous year. The fall in the number of cases treated is due to the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons being engaged in serum simul- taneous inoculation work. Out of 282 castrations done at the institutions 235 were done by Burdizzo's castrator. Seven hundred and five cases were supplied with medicines without their being brought to the institutions as against 255 of the previous year. 8. The District Boards of Kistna and Guntur and all the municipalities in this circle have exempted persons bringing the animals for treatment to the veterinary institutions from paying toll-gate fees. 9. During the year under report, a culvert in front of the gate of the Veterinary Hospital, Ongole, was constructed. 10. Veterinary Assistant Surgeons L. Kumaraswami and T. Sitaraman did good work during the year under report. (b) Touring Staff . 11. Two additional Veterinary Assistant Surgeons were posted with headquarters at Gudivada and Tenali on 8th January 1930 owing to prevalence of Rinderpest. The post of additional Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Gudivada, was con- sidered to have been abolished on 9th March 1930 afternoon. 12. Castrations.54 15. A comparative statement showing the work done by the touring staff is shown below:55 22. Some of the outbreak reports of the abovementioned diseases were not attended as Veterinary Assistant Surgeons were engaged in serum simultaneous inoculations. 23. Glanders.56 38. Municipal.57 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE NELLORE CIRCLE FOR THE YEAR 1929-30. This report relates to the new Nellore Circle comprising the two districts of Nellore and Cuddapah. This Circle was opened by Mr. A. L. N. Somayajalu Pantulu on the forenoon of the 15th June 1929 with headquarters at Nellore, and he was in charge of it till the end of the year. 2. He was on tour for 151 days and inspected once in detail all the veterinary institutions and the Touring Veterinary Assis- tant Surgeons except the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeon at Buchireddipalem in the Circle. All the veterinary institu- tions except the veterinary dispensaries at Rajampet and Cuddapah and all the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons except those at Buchireddipalem, Cuddapah and Rayachoti had also a second, though not detailed inspection by him. These latter could not be finished for want of time, as he had to visit some important villages in Nellore taluk during the month of March, taking advantage of the presence of the agricultural motor exhibition vans in that taluk, to do propaganda work in connexion with cattle-breeding and castration of scrub bulls, etc. The Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Buchireddi- palayam, could not be inspected during the year, as no officer could be posted to this place for about eight months in the year due to want of staff. 3. During the year under report, 3,656 cattle were protected against rinderpest by the serum simultaneous method of inoculation in all cases with the virus obtained from the Madras Veterinary College, except in one instance in which it was obtained from the Mysore Serum Institute, Bangalore. 4. During the year under review, the District Veterinary Officer selected buildings for the location of the Veterinary Dispensary at Kandukur and Proddatur, and also selected a site for the construction of permanent buildings at Venkatagiri. He also inspected the new building selected for the location of the Veterinary Dispensary at Rajampet and made arrangements to move the dispensary to this new building early in April 1930. 5. During the period of his stay at headquarters, he frequently visited the Veterinary Hospital, Nellore, and gave advice and help to the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge. 8
58 II.59 12. A comparative statement showing the work done at the several institutions is appended below :60 17. A comparative statement showing the work done by the touring staff is given below :61 this connexion the names of Messrs. I. M. Mahaboob Ali and C. Sriramulu deserve mention. The number of inoculations against this disease might have been greater still, but for the want of special serum at times, which handicapped work to some extent. No inoculations by serum alone method were undertaken against this disease during the year at all. The disease was virulent in the taluks of Cuddapah, Badvel, Rayachoti, Proddatur, Jammalamadugu and Pulivendla. The district of Nellore was almost free from this disease except that there were in all four outbreaks, one in each of the divisions of Podili and Darsi, and two in the taluk of Atmakur. For three of those outbreaks, animals imported from Cuddapah district in two instances and from Kurnool district in a third, were solely responsible, while the fourth was the result of spread from one neighbouring village to another. Timely precautions were taken and the disease was early brought under control in all these outbreaks. The District Veterinary Officer personally visited two of these outbreaks in Atmakur taluk of Nellore district which threatened to spread rapidly, and conducted 397 inoculations by the serum simultaneous method. He attended to three other outbreak reports in Cuddapah district in the villages of Madur of Prod- datur taluk and Peddamudiam and Suddapalli of Jammala- madugu taluk, and had 291 inoculations by serum simultaneous method done under his personal supervision in two of these villages. No inoculations could be done in the third, for want of virus from the Madras Veterinary College, and local virus could not be obtained in this village in spite of earnest attempts. He could not similarly draw and use local virus in a village in Atmakur taluk, in spite of his best efforts at persuasion. At present people of these districts are unwilling to permit the drawing of blood from their animals. The rate of deaths amongst cattle inoculated against rinderpest by the serum simultaneous method during the year is 1 in 1,000. 20. The "Cattle Disease Act" was in force in Kanigiri taluk and Podili and Darsi divisions of Nellore district from 1st April 1929 to 21st May 1929 and 10th July 1929 to 10th October 1929. It was also enforced in the taluks of Cuddapah, Badvel, Rayachoti, Jammalamadugu and Proddatur in Cuddapah district, for a period of six months from 17th September 1929. No prosecutions were made under the Act. 21. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia.62 before the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon could visit the scenes of outbreak. The District Veterinary Officer also personally visited nine outbreaks of this disease. The disease was virulent in Nellore district in the taluks of Kovur, Gudur and Venkata- giri. Two thousand nine hundred and forty-five inoculations by the serum alone method were performed against this disease, while 329 were performed during the previous year. The disease was also mildly prevalent in Kavali and Kandukur taluks of the same district. Smears from 30 cases were submitted for confir- mation. Out of this number, 15 were reported to be positive. 22. Anthrax.63 Treatment of animals affected with this disease by intrave- nous injection of 'Lugol's solution' could not be tried during the year under report. It will be given a fair trial in the current year. 25. Mange.64 33. Rabies.65 Ten animals were condemned by the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge of the Veterinary Dispensary, Venkatagiri, as being unfit for human consumption. (c) The three municipalities of Nellore, Cuddapah and Proddatur have adopted the by-laws relating to the control of contagious diseases of animals and are reporting mortality and outbreaks regularly. (d) Lethal chambers.66 this operation by Burdizzo method. It is gratifying to note that, as the result of this propaganda work, as many as 186 castrations were performed with the Burdizzo castrator in only about ten villages of Nellore taluk within a period of eleven days from 19th March 1930 to 29th March 1930 by the two Veterinary Assistant Surgeons who were taken along with the District Veterinary Officer for the purpose, whereas the number done in this taluk during the whole of the year was only 37. The District Veterinary Officer also delivered lectures in the villages on important subjects relating to cattle diseases and breeds of cattle in India and exhibited whenever possible lantern slides relating to the last mentioned subject which were obtained from the Agricultural vans. 40. During the period the Agricultural vans toured in Nellore district, at least one Veterinary Assistant Surgeon was always deputed to accompany them and do propaganda in villages by demonstration. 41. Government livestock.67 45. The touring staff had to report against seven village officers for slackness of duty. Punishments were awarded in six cases, while one is pending final disposal by the Revenue Divisional Officer concerned. 46. Correct registration of cattle diseases is being brought about gradually with the co-operation of the Revenue Officers, and this is considered an important item of work of this depart- ment. 47. It has been found very difficult to procure a suitable building for the location of the District Veterinary office at Nellore, although the District Veterinary Officer has been on the look-out for the same ever since the opening of new circle here. It has also been found to be equally difficult to procure suitable lodgings for the officer. It appears, therefore, necessary to contemplate the construction of Government buildings for both these purposes early in the future.
68 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE BELLARY CIRCLE FOR THE YEAR 1929-30. I.69 9. It is pleasing to note that the daily average attendance at all the institutions except those at Adoni and Harpanahalli has increased considerably. It is reported that owing to the prevalence of plague in Harpanahalli, the average has fallen. The cause for the low attendance at Adoni is attributed to the fact of the prevalence of rinderpest in a very severe form in the taluk. 10. The number of in and out-patients treated and castra- tions performed at all the institutions in this circle was 9,159. Out of 575 castrations performed at the veterinary institutions 545 were done by Burdizzo method. 11. Three hundred and twenty-one cases were supplied with medicines without their being brought to the institutions. 12. All the veterinary institutions in this circle have done good work during the year under report. 13. Government have sanctioned the construction of a compound wall on one side and wire fencing on other sides and a dressing shed for the Veterinary Hospital at Adoni. The work is in progress. Estimates for the construction of permanent buildings for the veterinary institutions at Bellary and Kurnool have also been sanctioned. 14. Veterinary Assistant Surgeons K. A. Ramaswami Ayyar, L. Audinarayana Sarma, K. Shantha Naik and P. N. Sivarama Ayyar are commended for good work. (b) Itinerating Staff. 15. There were eight Touring Veterinary Assistant Sur- geons in this circle at the close of the year. 16. The total number of castrations done by the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons was 482. Of these castrations 415 were done by Burdizzo method. 17. The touring staff treated 1,927 cases of contagious diseases and 2,021 cases of non-contagious diseases during the year under report. III.70 19. The Madras Cattle Disease Act was enforced for one month during the cattle fairs held at Kuruvathi village in Bellary district and at Gornatla village in Kurnool district. 20. Three thousand seven hundred and twenty-two inocu- lations by the serum simultaneous method were done during the year, three hundred and seventy-seven inoculations by the serum alone method were done during the cattle fair at Kuruvathi village in Bellary district. Veterinary Assistant Surgeons N. Ramanathan and G. C. Srihari Nayudu did a large number of inoculations by serum simultaneous method during the year. 21. Anthrax.71 30. Urethral calculi.72 40.

II.75 17. The Veterinary Hospital at Chittoor which was working as a dispensary in the previous year in a rented building was moved to the newly constructed Government building during the year. 18. A shed for a breeding bull has been put up in the Veterinary Hospital, Madanapalle, by the Agricultural Depart- ment, but the bull has not yet arrived. (b) Itinerating Staff. 19. Owing to the number of outbreaks of cattle diseases in the circle during the year under report the work of the limited touring staff was very heavy. 20. Castrations.76 24. Veterinary Assistant Surgeons S. A. Sastri, A. R. Madhu- suthanam, D. Antoniswami and K. S. Krishnaswami are commended for good work. The first helped to popularize the Chittoor Veterinary Hospital and the rest organized serum- simultaneous camps and assisted the District Veterinary Officer in inoculation work. III.77 33. Epizootic Lymphangitis.78 in the taluk, the Cattle Disease Act of 1866 was enforced and compulsory inoculation was resorted to. The District Veterinary Officer, Bellary, was present throughout the fair and two addi- tional Veterinary Assistant Surgeons were posted to assist in inoculation work. One thousand six hundred and twenty-five bovines were protected by the serum alone method against Rinderpest. (ii) The second annual cattle fair of Tenugallu of Kalyandrug taluk was held during the month of February 1930 and was attended by the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Anantapur. (iii) The annual cattle fair at Punganur was not conducted this year as per G.O. R. No. 92, Development, dated 6th April 1929. (iv) All cattle fairs and shows79 50. Research.80 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE VELLORE CIRCLE FOR THE YEAR 1929-30. I.81 The Headquarters hospital was frequently visited by the officers while at Headquarters and the Assistant was helped and advised whenever necessary. 3.The Government Live-Stock at Hosur Cattle Farm and Vellore Central Jail were inspected during the year; and 326 animals were protected by the serum simultaneous method against Rinderpest at the Farm. 4.The District Veterinary office was inspected by the Director of Veterinary Services, Madras, on the 30th January 1930. II.82 11. There were 144 cases supplied with medicines which were not brought to the institutions during the year against 96 in the previous year. 12. The dispensary at Namakkal which was opened towards the end of the previous year has made such good progress that it is under contemplation to have it converted into a hospital. 13. Buildings.83 combating the disease to particular taluks and as the diseases had subsided in some outbreaks. The rest were pending attendance at the end of the year. The disease was severe in Arkonam, Cheyyar and Tiruvanna- malai taluks of North Arcot district and Omalur taluk of Salem district. It was prevalent in other parts of this circle in a less severe form. 15,891 inoculations by the serum simultaneous method were done during the year as against 7,671 of the previous year, and 78 animals were inoculated by the serum alone method as against 8,447 of the previous year. The serum alone method of inoculation has been given up completely in favour of the serum simultaneous method ; and this accounts for the very great fall noticed under the serum alone method of inoculations. 17. Anthrax.84 25. Nasal granuloma.85 36. Government livestock.86 43. There has been an appreciable increase under receipts at the Veterinary Hospitals at Salem and Vellore over the pre- vious years' figures owing to the introduction of the revised scale of fees, the figures being as below87 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE MADRAS CIRCLE FOR THE YEAR 1929-30. Consequent on the creation of five more District Offices the jurisdiction of the IV Circle, Madras, which comprised the districts of Chingleput, South Arcot, Nellore and Tanjore had to undergo a change during June 1929 with the result that the districts of Nellore and Tanjore were removed on the 1 5th and 12th June 1929 respectively and the jurisdiction of the present Madras District Veterinary Officer consists of Chingleput and South Arcot districts only. 2. Mr. W. J. D'Costa continued to hold charge of the circle from the beginning of the year up to 3rd June 1929 afternoon when in connexion with the formation of new District Offices, he was transferred and was relieved by M.R.Ry. A. L. N. Somayajulu Pantulu who continued up to 14th June 1929 afternoon. The latter having been posted to open a new District Office at Nellore, was relieved of his duties by Mr. H. C. Sampath Ayyangar who remained in charge of the office up to 22nd October 1929 forenoon. Mr. Hurley was then posted and he held charge of this circle to the end of the official year. When he went to Bangalore for military training from 4th February to 21st February 1930, M.R.Ry. G. Krishnaswami Mudaliyar acted for him. 3. Mr. D'Costa spent 29 days on tour, checked the field work of the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Tirutturaip- pundi, visited the veterinary institutions at Tanjore and Maya- varam once, Saidapet thrice, Tiruvalur once (surprise) and the lethal chamber at Sembiam ; inspected the Veterinary Hospital, Kumbakonam, the animals of the Borstal Institute, Tanjore, selected a rented building for a new dispensary at Peravallur and checked also the head office stationery. 4. M.R.Ry. A. L. N. Somayajulu Pantulu counted a day for his tour by visiting Saidapet once. 5. During the period Mr. H. C. Sampath Ayyangar was in charge of the circle, he toured for 67 days, visited the Veteri- nary Hospital, Saidapet, thrice, Pallavaram cattle fair twice, paid a surprise visit to the field work of the Touring Veteri- nary Assistant Surgeon, Ponneri, and conducted a detailed inspection of the veterinary institutions at Saidapet, Chingle- put, Cuddalore, Tiruvallur, Tindivanam and Conjeeveram. He inspected the Veterinary Dispensary, Kallakurchi (partially), the building selected for the Veterinary Dispensary, Peravallur,
88 and the jail animals which were castrated by the Burdizzo method at Cuddalore. Lantern lectures were caused to be deli- vered twice at Ponneri in connection with Health Week Exhibition and once Kandamanadhi in Villupuram taluk under the auspices of the Rural Reconstruction Union. He investi- gated the cause of mortality among the inoculated animals at Pondur which proved to be due to trypanasomes and he caused the animals at the King Institute, Guindy, to be inoculated by the serum alone and the serum simultaneous methods and inspected them a second time as to their condition, etc. He also visited Conjeeveram to inspect the sites selected for the construction of permanent buildings and attended the Collec- tor's Darbar held in Madras. The offices of the Second Veteri- nary Assistant Surgeon, Saidapet, and the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons of Chingleput, Ponneri, Cuddalore and Tirukkoyilur were inspected in detail and the field work of the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Villupuram, was inspec- ted during the period. In addition to the above, he visited some of the rinderpest infected villages where the ryots had refused inoculation and convinced them of the advantages to be gained in submitting their animals for inoculation. 6. Mr. Hurley was on tour for 33 days. He visited the Veterinary Hospital, Saidapet, six times, the Veterinary Dispen- sary, Peravallur, twice and the Veterinary Dispensaries, Chingleput and Conjeeveram once along with the Director of Veterinary Services and inspected certain sites for the construc- tion of permanent buildings. He inspected in detail the work of the institutions at Cuddalore, Chingleput, Saidapet and the Second Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Veterinary Hospital, Saidapet, and the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons, Villupuram, Cuddalore and Chingleput and the Probationary Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Chingloput, once ; attended also the meeting of the site selection committee as a member, to inspect the site selected by the Executive Engineer for con- structing permanent buildings for a Veterinary Dispensary at Chingleput, served as a member of the Board of Examiners constituted to conduct the annual examinations of the Madras Veterinary College and also the Post-Graduate class. He underwent military training at Bangalore and inspected and issued the necessary instructions with regard to a case of surra at Saidapet Veterinary Hospital. In addition, he visited some of the rinderpest infected villages in both the districts, did propaganda work and assisted the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons concerned in conducting inoculations by serum simultaneous method.

Krishnasamy Mudaliyar while on tour for 10 days inspected the Veterinary Dispensary at Kallakurichi and the Government animals at the Agricultural Farm at Palla- kuppam; checked the field work of the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons, Villupuram and Tirukkoyilur and visited the Veterinary institutions at Saidapet, Tindivanam and Pera- vallur. He also inspected the head office stores as usual. II.90 11. "With regard to the conversion of the dispensaries into hospitals, the dispensary at Kallakurichi has not been raised to the rank of a hospital during the year as the additional struc- tures necessary for a hospital were completed late in the year. The construction of permanent buildings for the Veterinary Dispensaries at Chingleput and Conjeeveram is under correspondence. 12. The following new constructions have been carried out during the year, viz., (1) conversion of a horse stall into a canine operation room at Saidapet, (2) kennels for four dogs at Cuddalore, and (3) cattle ward, dressing shed and the com- pound wall at Kallakurichi. 13. Owing to the wide prevalence of Rinderpest in both the districts the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons in charge of the some of the veterinary dispensaries were instructed to attend the out- break reports of their respective taluks whenever urgency demanded and this they did willingly. (b) Touring Establishment. 14. On the 31st March 1930 there were five permanent Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons attached to this circle. On account of heavy work an additional Veterinary Assistant Surgeon's post was created. In addition, the Second Veteri- nary Assistant Surgeon attached to the Veterinary Hospital, Saidapet, was also deputed, as usual to attend outbreak reports. 15. It will be seen from the following statistics of the cases treated for non-contagious diseases and castrations performed, that the touring staff were, in addition to their strenuous in- oculation work, able to treat a large number of animals ailing from non-contagious diseases and perform castrations on a large scale:[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Plate No. 3. DERMOID GROWTH IN THE EYE91 attended to. Of the rest, some were left unattended for want of progress reports and time, some owing to the subsidence of the disease while others were pending attendance as they were received very near the end of the official year. Additional men had to be posted to the worst-affected localities according to necessity. The efforts on the part of the staff were not relaxed in any way which may be seen from the statement of inocula- tions done by the Veterinary Assistant Surgeens, given below:92 22.

He exhibited some slides of veterinary interest with the Agricultural Motor Exhibition van magic lantern at Vaduvur Mannargudi taluk. 10. The annual cattle fairs held at Samayapuram, Trichi- nopoly district, and at Nirathanallur of Tanjore district were visited by him. 11. The Circle office was inspected by the Director of Veterinary Services, Madras, during the year in the month of August. 12 He attended the opening of the Agricultural Demon- stration Car by the Chief Minister in June last at Trichinopoly. II.97 15. The number of cases treated at the veterinary institu- tions of this circle during the year under review is 15,103 while the number of cases supplied with medicines but not brought to institutions was 481. The attendance of the Veterinary Dispensary, Nannilam, was not satisfactory and this could be attributed to the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon's absence on itinerating duty. (b) Touring Establishments. 16. There were six Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons excluding second Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Veterinary Hospital, Kumbakonam, and Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge of the Veterinary Dispensary, Nannilam, who attended the outbreak reports in their respective taluks in addition to their hospital work. 17. The number of cases both contagious and non-conta- gious treated on tour was 3,967 out of which 2,586 come under contagious cases and the balance of 1,381 come under non-contagious cases. 18. The number of castrations done by the staff of this circle including those at veterinary institutions was 678 out of which the number of castrations done by Burdizzo method alone was 574. The rest were performed by ligature method. Out of the total number of 678 castrations performed in this circle and referred to above, 232 were done on tour. III.98 20.

V.103 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE MADURA CIRCLE FOR THE YEAR 1929-30 1.104 Revenue Department was in need of the building in which the Veterinary Dispensary was located and he selected a rented building for the same. 5. During the year 4,576 animals were protected by the serum simultaneous method against Rinderpest, of which 47 animals belonged to the Tuticorin Municipality and the rest, viz., 4,529 animals belonged to the ryots. Virus for inoculation was obtained from the Madras Veterinary College and local virus was also used whenever virus was not available at the College. He also attended some outbreaks of Rinderpest in Periyakulam Division along with the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeon. 6. While at headquarters, he was able to attend the Veterinary Hospital (Thallakulam), Madura, only four times and the Veterinary Dispensary at Madura City every day. He halted at headquarters and rendered professional aid to the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons. II.105 10. Five hundred and fifty-five castrations have been per- formed during the year as against 395 of the previous year. Out of these, 375 were performed by the Burdizzo method as against 222 of the previous year and eleven cocks were caponized successfully at the Veterinary Dispensary, Kodaikanal, as against nil of the previous year. 11. There has been an increase in the number of admissions, castrations, and daily average attendance in the veterinary ins- titutions at Tuticorin, Virudunagar, Devakottah and Dindigul as compared with those of the previous year. An increase in admission and castration and a slight fall in the daily average was observed in the Veterinary Dispensary at Periyakulam ; an increase in castration and daily average and a slight fall in admission was observed at the Veterinary Dispensary, Kodai- kanal. The decrease in the number of admission, daily average and castration at the Veterinary Dispensary, Rajapalayam and Veterinary Hospital (Thallakulam), Madura, is very perceptible when compared with those of the previous year. In the former the fall is attributed to the introduction of fees and in the latter the decrease is due to the opening of a branch veterinary dispensary in the heart of Madura City. 12. A slight fall under admission and daily average and an increase in the number of castrations is noticed in the veterinary institutions at Sivaganga, Ramnad and Sivakasi and in the Veterinary Hospital at Veerakeralampudur an unique fall under admission, daily average and castration is observed. The fall in all these institutions is attributed to the fact that the animals were employed in agricultural operations due to sufficient rains in those parts during the year under report. 13. The work in the veterinary institution at Madura City cannot be compared with that of the previous year as it was opened only in the latter part of the last year. 14. The Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge of the Veterinary Dispensary, Virudunagar, attended to the animals in the Agricultural Farm at Koilpatti, whenever there was a call for him from the Farm. 15. A temporary waiting shed and operation shed have been constructed at each of the veterinary institutions at Periyakulam, Ramnad, Virudunagar and Sivakasi. 14
106 16. Veterinary Assistant Surgeons G. Avoodanayagam Pillai, V. Sankaranarayanan and P. Kadambavanasundaram deserve special mention for good work, (b) Itinerating Staff. 17. There were nine touring billets and no new touring billet was opened during the year. The touring billet of Siva- ganga division remained closed till 11th September 1929 and the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons of Srivilliputtur and Paramakudi attended to the outbreak reports of this division during that period. Paramakudi division was also kept closed from 29th June 1929 to 10th January 1930 on account of the permanent incumbent being transferred to the Veterinary Dis- pensary, Ramnad, and the other Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons of Ramnad district attended to the outbreak reports of the above division in addition to their own, whenever occasion arose. 18. A comparative statement of the work done by the touring staff during 1928-29 and 1929-30 is appended below:107 III.108 Number of animals inoculated by serum simultaneous method. Death due to reaction within four days of inoculation. Death due to reaction between the 4th and 7th day of inocu- lation. Death due to reaction between the 7th and 14th day of inoou- lation. Death after 14 days of inoculation. Total deaths among the inoculated animals. Remarks. 4,676 .. 3 4 .. 7 23. There have been in all seven deaths among the animals inoculated by the serum simultaneous method. The four deaths shown under column 4 were due to the fact that the animals were exposed to chill and other adverse conditions of weather and the three deaths shown in column 3 are said to be due to excessive reaction. There was no mortality from Piroplasmosis among the inoculated animals during the year under report. 24. Anthrax.109 30. Theleriasis.110 39.

V.112 breeding bull is stationed at the Veterinary Hospital, (Thalla- kulam), Madura, under the management of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge. 52. Advisory Committees have been formed during the year under report to visit institutions where the attendance is small and offer advice as to how the work in those institutions can be improved. It is premature to say anything definitely about the working of these committees at present. 53. The Executive staff had to complain against 16 vil- lage officers for slackness in reporting outbreaks of contagious diseases. 54. Office staff.113 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE COIMBATORE CIRCLE FOR THE YEAR 1929-30. I.114 4. Mr. A. Castelino did no touring work as he was in charge of the current duties only. 5. Mr. A. G. Wilson was on tour for 125 days, inspecting in detail all the veterinary institutions and offices of the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons. All the institutions and tour- ing billets have been inspected twice during the year except the touring billet at Valparai which was inspected but once as it was opened only on 10th October 1929. Mr. Wilson conducted sero-aggressin inoculations against blackquarter at the Cattle Breeding Farm at Palayakottai, belonging to the Pattagar of Palayakottai, serum simultaneous inoculations against Rinderpest at the Imperial Dairy Farm, Willington and the Municipality at Coonoor and investigated cases of chronic hæmaturia amongst some cows at the Wellington dairy. He also inspected the Government animals at the Nanjanad Potato Farm, and at Naduvattam, the electro- cution shed for dogs at Ootacamund, attended some of the weekly cattle fairs at Kangayam, Tudiyalur, Vellalur, Tiruppur and Punjapuliampatti and also attended to several outbreaks of Rinderpest personally in the circle, organizing serum simultaneous inoculation camps in village. While at headquarters he frequently visited the local Veterinary Hospital and the Agricultural College Veterinary Hospital and rendered such professional help to the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons as was necessary from time to time. He served as an Examiner in the B.Sc. (Agricultural) Degree examination of 1930, the Syndicate of the Madras University having offered him the Examinership in Animal Hygiene once again. The local Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals requested his services as one of the judges at the annual animal show held in October 1929 at Coimbatore and though he readily agreed to comply with their request, he had to depute the local Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge of the Veterinary Hospital to do the work as he was detained in the Nilgiris at the time on account of urgent Rinderpest inoculation work. During the year he also worked as the honorary Veterinary Assistant Surgeon of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Coimbatore. The District Veterinary office has been inspected as usual by the Director of Veterinary Services during the year.

115 II.116 11. The construction of quarters for the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon and a well for the Veterinary Hospital at Tiruppur has been completed during the year. 12. During the year the following buildings were construc- ted at the Veterinary Hospital, Coonoor, namely, an operation shed, a waiting shed, quarters for the compounder and the menials, a dogs' operation room, a covered passage between the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon's quarters and the kitchen and a compound wall. 13. The following works were completed at the Veterinary Hospital, Ootacamund:117 There has been a decrease of cases treated and castrated owing to some of the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons having been posted to hold charge of institutions when the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons in charge of Veterinary institu- tions were granted leave and also when Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons have been posted as additional Veterinary Assistant Surgeons in areas where there were severe outbreaks of Rinderpest. 19. Castrations by Burdizzo method.118 serum alone method were done during the year as against 4,440 inoculations by serum simultaneous method and 8,558 inocula- tions by serum alone method of the previous year in the two districts. The serum alone method of inoculations has been persistently decried except in emergent cases of pregnant animals and those in a very weak state of health and in the case of animals with foreign blood in them which had to be protected temporarily in the absence of class l special anti-rinderpest serum. 25. In connexion with the outbreak of this disease in the Municipality at Ootacamund during May 1929, a hospital pound was opened within the municipal limits and the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Ootacamund, was in charge of the hospital pound and three additional Veterinary Assistant Surgeons were deputed to combat the outbreak in the Nilgiris. 26. A comparatively large number of serum simultaneous inoculations was done during the year. The number of inocu- lations performed could have been far greater still but for the breakdown in the supply of serum and virus on some occasions. 27. Additional touring men were posted temporarily at Ootacamund and Kollegal to combat the disease. 28. Anthrax.119 32.

Tincture of Iodine has been tried as a preventive on healthy fowls in an outbreak of fowl pest by one of the staff and the results as a preventive appear to be satisfactory. The several experiments tried go to prove that Iodine in some form or other is useful both as a preventive and a curative. Further experiments require to be done to ascertain definitely in what dose and by what methods of administration the iodine should be used. During the year the District Veterinary Officer also investi- gated the several cases of Chronic Hæmaturia amongst cattle in the Imperial Dairy Farm at Wellington in particular and in the Nilgiris in general. The several smears of blood examined revealed no piroplasms or trypanosomes and samples of fæces and urine of cattle affected revealed no organisms No ova of Bilharzi have been detected in the urine and no coccidia or other parasitic ova at all in the fæces. These animals suffer from Hæmaturia for 2 or 3 years and sometimes even up to 4 years and the general signs of health are not much altered. They feed well and ruminate but at the same time, show a gradual but progressive emaciation until they die after some years through sheer exhaustion. The swamps in the Nilgiris with their luxuriant growth of rank grasses should afford a characteristic habitat for parasites amongst cattle but, so far no cystic or intestinal parasites or ova have been discovered in any of these cases. Further investigations with regard to the aeteological factor and treatment of the disease are going on. 53.

One new Veterinary Dispensary was opened at Udipi on the 1st September 1929, and the total strength of the institutions at the end of the year was seven. 9. The number of in-and out-patients treated during the year was 9,532 as against 9,642 in the previous year including the 219 cases of the Veterinary Dispensary, Udipi, opened during the year, thus showing a fall of 329 cases among the old institutions. There was a fall of 317 in the number of cases treated at. the Veterinary Hospital, Calicut. The decrease was partly due to the introduction of revised fees, and the large number in the previous year is considered to be phenomenal, The dispensary at Palghat recorded a fall of 220 cases which was partly due to contagious cases having been wrongly entered during the previous year, and partly due to the introduction of the fees system. There was a fall of 108 at the Veterinary Hospital, Mangalore, mainly due to the considerable decline in the number of fowl-cholera cases during the year, as also a perceptible fall in the average daily attendance by nearly eight. There has been an increase of 233 cases at the Veterinary Dis- pensary, Cannanore, and 78 cases at the Veterinary Dispensary, Puttur. The Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge of the Veterinary Dispensary, Puttur, continued to attend outbreaks in Puttur taluk in addition to dispensary work. The amount of work done in the other institutions continued to be almost the same as in the previous year. 10. The total number of cases not brought to the institu- tions, but supplied with medicines during the year was 550 as against 765 of last year. 11. Two hundred and seventy-three castrations (80 by Burdizzo method) were done at the institutions as against 274 in the previous year. It is interesting to note that two ponies were castrated by Burdizzo method at the Veterinary Dispen- sary, Tellicherry, and the result was very satisfactory. Out of 59 castrations at the Veterinary Hospital, Calicut, 58 were done by Burdizzo method, and strenuous endeavours are being made to popularize this method.

In the Director's statement, a sum of Rs. 63-11-6 is shown under " Hospitals and DispensariesNo. 1772, DEVELOPMENT, 19TH SEPTEMBER 1930 155 The revised curriculum of the Madras Veterinary College which was under the consideration of Government has since been approved and introduced from the beginning of the current academic year (1930-31). 4. Seven new dispensaries were opened during the year includ- ing one at Jeypore. The number of cases admitted to institutions for treatment increased from 137,022 in 1928-29 to 149,235 in 1929-30 ; the number of cases supplied with medicine but not brought to institutions also showed a similar increase. 5. The number of deaths from contagious diseases during the year decreased. As in 1928-29, rinderpest continued to be virulent and contributed to 106,046 deaths, the corresponding number in the previous year being 129,583. The disease was virulent in the districts of North Arcot, Tanjore and South Arcot, the total deaths from these districts alone being 38,814 representing nearly 37 per cent of the total mortality from this disease. Inoculation by the serum simultaneous method was adopted on an extensive scale during the year, the number of such inoculations performed having nearly doubled as compared with the previous year. On the contrary, the number of inoculations by the serum-alone method decreased from 171,206 in 1928-29 to 13,224 in 1929-30. There is thus clear evidence that inoculation by the serum simultaneous method is becoming popular and owing to the efficacy of this system, the department can in time hope considerably to reduce the mortality from rinderpest in this Presidency. 6. Towards the end of the year, orders were issued on the provincialisation of the veterinary service in this Presidency.

I.2 3. Mr. T. J. Hurley held the post of District Veterinary Officer, Madras, from the beginning of the year till 23rd April 1930 when he proceeded on leave. He was posted to the Madras Veterinary College as Principal from 2nd July 1930, and he was confirmed in this appointment in December 1930. Mr. V. Krishnamurthi Ayyar who was acting as Principal, Madras Veterinary College, and Professor of Pathology and Bacteriology, from the beginning of the year, proceeded on six months' leave from 2nd July 1930 and was posted as District Veterinary Officer, Madanapalle, after the expiry of the leave. He assumed charge of the post of District Veteri- nary Officer, Madanapalle, on 14th February 1931 and con- tinued to hold it throughout the year under report. (c) Madras Veterinary Service. 4. Mr. H. C. Sampath Ayyangar, who was in charge of the Vellore Circle at the beginning of the year, was posted as District Veterinary Officer, Madras, from 23rd April 1930 and he held this post till the end of the year. Mr. R. Nara- singa Rao was in charge of the Bezwada Circle till 7th May 1930 when he went on leave. On the expiry of the leave, he was posted as District Veterinary Officer, Trichinopoly, which post he held from 23rd June 1930 till the end of the year. Mr. K. Kailasam Ayyar continued to hold charge of the post of Resident Veterinary Officer and Personal Assistant to the Principal, Madras Veterinary College, throughout the year in addition to the lectureship in Hygiene to which he was appointed on the introduction of the new curriculum from 1st July 1930. Mr. A. J. Wilson continued to hold charge of the Coimbatore Circle throughout the year. Mr. M. R. V. Panikkar who was acting as Professor of Medicine and Officer in charge of the Parasitological section from the beginning of the year, was appointed as Lecturer in Pharmocology from 1st July 1930 and he continued to hold this post throughout the year. He was on leave for one month from 7th June 1930. Mr. M. Anantnarayan Rao, who returned from the United King- dom after the expiry of the combined leave on average pay and study leave during the year, was posted to the Madras Veterinary College as Lecturer in Parasitology from 2nd July 1930. Messrs. A. Ramachandra Ayyar and K. S. Nayar continued as District Veterinary Officer, Madura, and Lecturer in Surgery, Madras Veterinary College, respectively, through- out the year. Mr. W. J. D'Costa was in charge of the Trichi- nopoly Circle during the beginning of the year. He was transferred to the Vellore Circle from 29th April 1930 and continued to hold charge of it till the end of the year.
3 Messrs. A. K. Mitra and C. Venkataratnam Chetti continued to bold charge of the Bellary and Vizagapatam Circles respect- ively throughout the year. Mr. G. A. Ajwani, who was in charge of the Madanapalle Circle from the beginning of the year till 2nd July 1930, was posted to the Madras Veterinary College as acting Lecturer in Pathology and Bacteriology in the place of Mr. V. Krishnamurthi Ayyar and he continued to hold this post till the end of the year. 5. Messrs. A. L. N. Somayajulu Pantulu, C. Suryanara- yanamurthi and T. S. Alagappa Pillai, probationers in the Madras Veterinary Service, continued to be in charge of the Nellore, Rajahmundry and Calicut Circles, respectively, throughout the year under report Mr. K. S. Natesa Ayyar, who was appointed to act as District Veterinary Officer, in the Madras Veterinary Service, took charge of the Bezwada Circle on 7th May 1930 and continued to hold it till the end of the year. 6. During the year under report, the following officers were confirmed in the Madras Veterinary Service with effect from the date mentioned against each :4 curriculum of the Madras Veterinary College has for some time been engaging attention. During the year under report, Government issued orders sanctioning the scheme for the introduction of the new curriculum and the appointment of an additional staff of four lecturers borne on the cadre of Madras Veterinary Service besides the necessary additional equipment, etc. The first year course under the new curri- culum was introduced with effect from 1st July 1930. 9. The period of study under the new curriculum remains the same as hitherto, viz., three years, but the curriculum is designed to provide a basic training in most of the essential subjects pertaining to Veterinary Science and the subjects have been redistributed among the three classes as shown in the administration report of the Madras Veterinary College, appended. An important feature in the new curriculum is the prominence given to the study of cattle and the changes introduced in the subjects of Comparative Anatomy, the ox being taken as the standard instead of the horse. 10. The preliminary educational standard for admission to the College under the new curriculum is S.S.L.C. with 45 per cent of the marks in English, but with a view to induce young men with higher educational qualifications to join the College, 14 of the 40 seats are reserved for Intermediates and six for Science Graduates. On appointment to the depart- ment, three years' seniority for pay will be given in the case of Intermediates and five years' seniority in the case of Science Graduates. These men are not, however, given sti- pends as they will be started on a higher initial pay than the ordinary S.S.L.C. holder. 11. There was an increase in the total number of students undergoing the course at the Madras Veterinary College during the year, 117 students being on the rolls on 31st March 1931 as against 109 of the previous year. Of these 117 students, 10 were paying students5 for the final year examination, 27 students were successful and were awarded diploma. The Board of Examiners considered the results satisfactory. 14. The Refresher course was as usual held at the Madras Veterinary College for a period of six months from July to December 1930. Six Veterinary Assistant Surgeons from this department, one from the Corporation of Madras and one from the Pudukottai State attended the course. An examination was held at the end of the course. (b) Hospital. 15. The Veterinary Hospital attached to the Madras Veterinary College continued to show satisfactory progress. There was an increase in the total number of admissions during the year as compared with the previous year, the figures for the two years 1930-31 and 1929-30 being 3,794 and 3,558, respectively, but there has been a perceptible fall in the hospital receipts from Rs. 6,633-13-6 in the previous year to Rs. 4,875-12-6 in the year under report. This fall is attributed to the free treatment afforded to animals, the owners of which are in receipt of an income of less than Rs. 200 per mensem under the revised rules introduced in the year 1928. 16. The branch Veterinary Dispensary for out-patients at Royapuram made rapid progress during the year under report and is increasing in popularity. The total number of admis- sions in this institution during the year was 2,125 as against 1,309 of the previous year. The daily average attendance also increased from 23.00 in 1929-30 to 31.3 during 1930-31 Thirteen canines for observation for rabies and 15 animals of various species were sent from this dispensary to the Madras Veterinary College for major operations or treatment. (c) Laboratory. 17. The laboratory attached to the Madras Veterinary College continued to work satisfactorily. The number of specimens received and examined in both the Pathological and Parasitological sections of the laboratory during the year was 4,765. This number does not, however, include the specimens examined in connexion with the items of research work and those received from the Rinderpest virus production camp and is, therefore, not comparable with the last year's figures. Details of the work done in the different sections of the labora- tory are given in section IV of the administration report of the Madras Veterinary College.
6 18. Rinderpest virus production was continued in the Pathological section of the laboratory and 380, 575 c.cs. of virus were prepared during the year as against 467,675 c.cs. in the previous year, the demand for virus during the year under report being less than that of the previous year. III.7 With the exception of Guntur, North Arcot, Kistna, Tanjore, Malabar, Kurnool and Ganjam districts, serious outbreaks and heavy mortality have not been experienced elsewhere. Gun- tur district suffered most from this disease, the number of deaths there being 9,405. 24. The number of outbreaks in which inoculations were undertaken during the year was 1,452 as against 1,814 in the previous year. The total number of inoculations performed against Rinderpest by the serum simultaneous method and serum alone method was 147,880 and 1,136 respectively as compared with 169,836 and 13,224 of the previous year. The fall is due to the lesser number of outbreaks reported during the year and also to the irregular supply of serum from Muk- tesar for a period of about five months. 25. In connexion with the proposal for the establishment of a serum institute in this Presidency, Government sanc- tioned during the year the conduct of certain experiments in serum manufacture at the Madras Veterinary College with a view to finding out whether potent serum can be manufactured in or near Madras in the hot as well as cold months and to determine the range of potency of the serum. The work of producing serum under the experimental scheme was started on 1st January 1931 and up to the end of the year, a total quantity of 43,500 c.cs. of both hot and cold weather serum, sufficient to immunize by the serum simultaneous method about 1,200 head of cattle was prepared and issued to the staff after laboratory test, for use in the districts. The reports so far received on the results of the use of this serum indicate that the serum has stood the test under ordinary field conditions. 26. Anthrax.8 6,342 of the previous year, 18,605 animals were inoculated against this disease during the year under report, as follows :[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Plate No. 2.9 fowls were protected with vaccine prepared at the Madras Veterinary College. In addition to these, 88 country fowls were treated at the Veterinary Dispensary, Kodaikanal, with a vaccine prepared by Dr. Turkud of Kodaikanal, and it is reported that 56 of them were successfully protected. 41. Further study on the incidence of this disease was undertaken by M.R.Ry. K. Kailasam Ayyar during the year. Details of the experiments conducted and observations made by him are recorded in section VI of the Administration re- port of the Madras Veterinary College. 42. Contagious abortion.10 48. The work done at the following institutions is com- mendable :[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Plate No. 3.11 acquittals. The remaining case was pending trial on 31st March 1931. One hundred and seventy-two animals were examined by the staff of the department for malicious injury and the necessary certificates were issued to the Police. 53. Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.12 published by this department on some of the important diseases of animals were distributed free to the ryots. 59. Besides four sets of 200 magic lantern slides each prepared for use in the districts. Two hundred and forty-one slides and captions and 100 prints were prepared during the year at the Madras Veterinary College for propaganda purposes. 60. Although it was not always practicable, advantage was taken of the presence of motor vans of the Agricultural Department by the District Veterinary Officers for propaganda work on Veterinary matters in collaboration with the Agri- cultural officers. In November 1930, one of the motor units of the Agricultural Department was temporarily placed at the disposal of this department for two months exclusively for propaganda work on Veterinary matters and this was carried out in the Vizagapatam district with satisfactory results. 61. Fairs and shows.13 in force in the Madras Veterinary College and in 25 important veterinary institutions in the mufassal during the year under report, the second year of its trial. The total receipts on account of fees realized in veterinary institutions during the year was about Rs. 12,468, while in the years 1929-30 and 1928-29 the fees amounted to about Rs. 15,444 and Rs. 9,310 respectively. 65. There has been an increase in the receipts after the introduction of the new rates of fees without unduly affecting the attendance at the institutions. Except in the case of a few, there was no indication that the new scale of fees was prejudicial to the working of the institutions. A detailed report is being submitted to Government on the subject. IX.14 68. Education.15 * * * * * 73. With a view to conducting an investigation into the methods adopted at present for combating Rinderpest in this Presidency, to ascertain the most economical and efficient dose of serum required to protect cattle by the Serum Simultaneous method and suggesting measures for improving the statistics relating to outbreaks of Rinderpest and mortality due to it, Government have sanctioned during the current year the crea- tion of a post of Special Rinderpest Officer borne on the Madras Veterinary Service, temporarily for a period of two years and have approved the appointment of M.R.Ry. H. C. Sam- path Ayyangar Avargal to the post. A programme of work and a detailed memorandum of the points for investigation have already been drawn up and approved by Government. Mr. Sampath Ayyangar will assume charge of his new post and commence the investigation shortly. 74. The production of anti-Rinderpest serum being an essential factor in the preventive measures adopted for this disease, the question of the establishment of a Serum Insti- tute in this Presidency with a view to ensure a prompt and uninterrupted supply of serum for use in the districts, has been under consideration. The proposal to locate the Institute at Coonoor having been abandoned, experiments were conducted at the Madras Veterinary College during the year under report to ascertain whether potent serum can be produced in or near Madras City both in the cold and hot weather. Up to the present, several hundred animals have been immunised by the Serum Simultaneous method with the serum manufactured under the experimental scheme and the results are satisfac- tory. The experiments having afforded sufficient data of a definite nature in regard to the potency of the serum manu- factured in Madras during the hot as well as cold weather, a detailed scheme has been drawn up for the establishment of an Institute in Madras for the production of serum on a large scale. If the sanction of Government is received in time, it is hoped to commence manufacture during the current year. 75. Propaganda.16 lectures without frequently indenting on the Principal, Madras Veterinary College for assistance it is proposed to give train- ing in lantern demonstration work to one or two Veterinary Assistant Surgeons from each circle at the Madras Veterinary College during the current year. 76. In connexion with the propaganda work of this depart- ment, proposals are already before Government for the equip- ment of a separate motor unit for this department. It has recently been suggested to Government that if this is not possi- ble in view of the present financial stringency, one of the three motor units now in possession of the Agricultural Department may be lent to this department as a temporary measure for a sufficiently long period every year for Veterinary propaganda purposes. P. T. SAUNDERS, Director of Veterinary Services MADRAS, 9th July 1931.
17 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE MADRAS VETERINARY COLLEGE FOR THE YEAR 1930-31. I.18 December 1930 and from that date M.R.Ry. A. Raja Rao Nayudu, Assistant Lecturer, was in charge of the subject of Anatomy. M.R.Ry. M. R. V. Panikkar Avargal did the duties of the Lecturer in Physiology as he had not to teach Pharmacology during the year according to the revised curri- culum. The post of a temporary Assistant Lecturer in Chemis- try was sanctioned for one year in G.O. Ms. No. 1353 (27-S), Development, dated 30th June 1930, in the scale of Rs. 12519 20 The strength of classes B and C at the end of the year was 43 and 32 respectively making a total of 117 on 31st March 1931 for all the classes. Arranged according to community these were :21 (b) Scholarships.22 For those students who failed in not more than one subject in the examinations held in March 1930 in the first and second year classes and were provisionally promoted, a supplementary examination was held in October 1930. Four students ap- peared for the examination and all of them passed. (e) Refresher Course.23 The College Day annual sports were held in February under the presidency of the Hon'ble Mr. P. T. Rajan, Minister for Public Works. The various events were well contested and the students had a very enjoyable day. III.24 The second dog was given the dose in 10 c.c. of distilled water half in each leg; after injection the leg was swollen and the dog was lame. Smears taken subsequently revealed P. canis in gradually decreasing numbers and from the third day smears were negative. 3. Normal Saline 3 per cent and 4 per cent.25 During the year 15 ponies and 48 cattle were remanded by the Presidency Magistrate, of which only one was sent to Pinjrapole. (c) The Shoeing Forge.26 its inception was to be demolished and utilized for some other purpose. The figures furnished below will testify to the increasing popularity and usefulness of the institution although it continued to be a part-time dispensary. In addition to providing materials for the clinical instruction of the students of the College for which it is intended, it has been a real boon to the owners of cattle and other animals in the neighbour- hood :27 work. The number of specimens received and examined is shown below :28 Bovine lymphangitis.29 two bullocks suffering from hæmaturia for a considerable time. Out of the three specimens received from the Veteri- nary Hospital, Coonoor, two were from cows and one from a bullock ; of the two cows, one was of Ayrshire breed. All the above specimens were confirmed microscopically for villous papilloma of the bladder. (b) Parasitology. M.R.Ry. M. R. V. Panikkar Avargal was in charge of this section till 2nd July 1930 on which date M.R.Ry. M. Ananta- narayana Rao Avargal took over and continued to remain in charge. The numbers of specimens received and examined in this section including those which were received in the clinical laboratory are shown below :30 the chicken has not been recorded in this Presidency till now. The specimens came from the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge of the Veterinary Dispensary, Tellicherry. It is interesting to record that a tumour of spirocerca sanguinolenta was recovered from the hip joint of a dog. This specimen was received from the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge of the Veterinary Hospital, Vizianagaram. Specimens of gastrodiscus species have been collected from an elephant and these have not been recorded from that animal hitherto. (c) Entomology. A survey of ticks on cattle in this Presidency was under- taken. One. hundred and thirty-two tubes containing ticks and a few other ceteroparasites were received from various parts of the Presidency. Besides these 20 tubes were collected by the staff of this section. It is observed that ticks belong- ing to the Genera hæmaphysalis, hyalomma and margaropus seem to be very common. Occasionally a species of Rhiphi- cephalus was met with in cattle. For want of time it has not been possible to classify all these ticks into respective species. A few ticks were obtained from a panther and they were found to be hæmaphysalis bispinosa and hæmaphysalis leachi. On one occasion a species of Amblyoma was obtained from a cow. Some good specimens of Argus persicus were collected and added to the collection of the College Museum. It was found that hæmaphysalis bispinosa was not selective in choosing its host. From Palghat a few larvæ of 31 M.R.Ry. L. S. Parameswara Ayyar was in charge of this laboratory from 1st April 1930 to 29th July 1930 when M.R.Ry. G. R. Viswanathan took over and continued to the end of the year under report. (e) Rinderpest virus Section. The work in this section continued to be done under the immediate supervision of M.R.Ry. K. Kailasam Ayyar Avargal. Two Veterinary Assistant Surgeons were attached to this sec- tion to assist the officer in charge. The other staff consisted of an attender and three cattlemen. The animals used for rinderpest virus production consist- ed of heifer, bull and buffalo calves and the virulence of the virus was maintained by the alteration of passages between hull and buffalo. Experiments on the result of the passage of rinderpest virus through sheep and goats were conducted during the early part of the year under report. Twenty-six goats and 17 sheep were used for the purpose. Although the number of animals used in this experimental work does not warrant general conclusions being drawn as to the results, yet it appears reasonable to infer from the reactions observed in these animals that repeated passage of rinderpest virus through sheep exalts the virulence for bovines and similar passage of the virus through goats attenuates the virulence for bovines. In fact it was found to be not possible to propagate the virus in the goat after the fourth or fifth passage. The virus producers were housed in the existing temporary thatched sheds. It has been decided not to renovate or re- build these sheds in view of the proposed Serum Institute in Madras to which this virus section will be transferred. From 1st April 1930 to 31st March 1931, 380,575 c. cs. of virus were prepared covering 531 brews of which the quantity issued to the staff was 308,500 c.cs. The issue of virus included the indents from Hyderabad State for 4,155 c.c. of virus. The potency of the virus was quite satisfactory. Statement showing the quantity of rinderpest virus pre- pared and issued during the past three years :32 The decrease in the quantity of virus prepared in the year under report is due to the demand being less as compared with the previous year. Theileria mutans was detected in 156 calves out of 454 examined, either alone or with other intercurrent affections. No restrictions were imposed on the issue of Theileria-infect- ed virus as in the previous years. Other protozoon infections such as resuscitation of piro- plasma begeminum either alone or associated with theileria mutans were found in 68 cases. Trypanosomiasis was detect- ed in three and microfilaria in ten cases and these were not utilized for virus production. The total number of microscopical specimens examined in the rinderpest section during the year amounted to 11,156 as against 10,444 of the previous year and 346 post mortem examinations were conducted on the carcasses of calves used for virus production. Animal supplies.33 V.34 have already been dealt with. Since the post-m in fowls so closely simulated those met with in rinderpest in bovines, a preliminary study of c undertaken. Cross tests.35 brain tissue appear to be suitable as material for vaccine. As regards immunity following the use of the vaccine, it is pre- mature to say how long the immunity lasts. It would appear that at least a week must elapse after vaccination for birds to resist infection. Owing to the widespread outbreak of the disease in the City and in the districts, it was rather difficult to secure healthy fowls for experimental purposes, but all possible precautions were however taken in selecting healthy birds for the experi- ment. These were kept under observation whenever possible. Virulent materials from bovines infected with rinderpest were injected into nine fowls and in all the post-mortem find- ings were confirmed for pseudo-fowl-pest. So far it has not been possible to infect bovines with virus from fowls infected with the disease, but lesions simulating those of pseudo-fowl-pest were produced among fowls when injected with virulent materials from cases of rinderpest in bovines. An anti-serum from recovered birds was prepared, but it failed to protect the tested birds against infection. A paper on this disease was read at the All-India Veterinary Conference held during the year at Bangalore. Mr. G. A. Ajwani was in charge of the experiments in connexion with rinderpest vaccine, sarcoma and carcinoma. Rinderpest vaccine.36 The calf tested with Walker's vaccine got an attack of rinderpest and died. Out of three calves which were employed to test Kelser's vaccine, two calves had to be destroyed on account of foot-and-mouth disease and one calf did not show any reaction. Of the three calves inoculated with Boynton's vaccine, two did not show any reaction and one was destroyed on account of foot-and-mouth disease. Transmission experiments in sarcoma and carcinoma.37 view to find out the relation between the different strains. The study of the adhesion phenomenon of these strains has shown that these three strains are identical. This small trypanosome is Trypanosoma evansi and is the cause of surra in horses, cattle, dogs, etc. The strains maintained in the laboratory died out rapidly for some reason or other. It is proposed to continue the study with fresh materials. Attempts were made to culture these trypanosomes on various media without success so far. Transmission experiments with ornithodorus savignii proved to be negative and presumably this parasite is not a vector in the spread of this disease. As regards the large trypanosome, T. theileri, which was found once in a bull belonging to the Corporation of Madras, the sick animal showed symptoms simulating those of piro- plasmosis and died in about a week's time. Blood from this bullock was inoculated into two healthy calves and these developed the trypanosomes in five days' time, but no piro- plasms were seen. This shows that the bull had no piroplasms in its blood and apparently it died of the heavy infection of these large trypanosomes. From the inoculated calves cul- tures of these trypanosomes were obtained easily in blood and broth mixture. It was rather difficult to obtain sub-cultures. These cultures were found to be non-infective when adminis- tered orally or subcutaneously to other calves. To study the incidence of this kind of trypanosome in calves, blood from all calves used in the rinderpest virus production camp was cultured. Only one calf out of 84 tested showed trypanosomes in culture though its blood was negative when examined under the microscope. Judging from this, the percentage is very small, but it is probable that the percentage may be found to be higher if a systematic examination of blood from cattle from various localities in this Presidency is done. It has been noted that these trypanosomes multiply in the gut of Stomoxys calcitrans, but unfortunately, no trans- mission experiments could be done owing to the loss of these experimental flies caused by the attack of ants. The experi- ment could not be repeated as one of the experimental calves died and in the other the infection had disappeared completely. No developmental forms were seen in Ornithodorous savignii and it failed to transmit the disease. Linognathus vituli was likewise found to be a non-vector. This trypanosome was not inoculable to laboratory animals. 2. The study of Trypanosoma indicum of the squirrel (S. palmarum) and T. lewisi of the black rat was undertaken with a view to observing the adhesion phenomenon so that
38 the same phenomenon could be better interpreted on the strains of T. evansi. Their cultural characters were studied. It was noted that some characters of the large trypanosome of cattle simulated those of T. indicum and T. lewisi. T. indicum of the squirrel was found to be uninoculable to the black rat and vice versa. The cultures of T. indicum when injected sub- cutaneously to a squirrel were infective. In the cultures that appeared metacylic, trypanasomes were present which perhaps accounted for the infection. 3. Treatment of trypanosomiasis.[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page]

39 with " Asuntol ", a Bayer's product. One case was dis- charged cured and two others, in the blood of which the parasites disappeared, subsequently died of rinderpest. Out of the cases treated with Trypanblue (Merck's brand) in ten cases the piroplasm disappeared, in three cases they persisted and in the rest no opinion could be given because the calves died of rinderpest within a day or two after the injection. Asuntol appears to be superior to trypanblue in its action on the piroplasm, but it is comparatively costly. It is interest- ing to note that a calf 15 days old died of the effects of P. bigeminum in Amalapuram village. It is generally supposed that young calves withstand the effects of this piroplasm, but this appears to be an exception. 4. Babesia (Theileria) mutans.40 elongatus when fed to calves. While searching for parasites during post-mortem examination of a stray dog, one echinos- tome was obtained from its intestines. It is believed to be the first time that an echinostome has been recorded in a dog in Madras. A large number of limea acuminata obtained from the same tank were found to be infected with echinos- tome cercariæ. These were allowed to encyst in other snails and were then fed to a dog. From this dog adult echinostomes were obtained. It was also observed that these cercariæ encyst in the region of the gills in fresh water fish " Barbus Stigma ". It is said that a species of echinostome produces fatal enteritis in dogs. Further experiments are in progress. Furco cercariæ of schistosoma spindalis were identified and fed to a calf. These cercariæ were obtained only from Plamorbis exustus. The calf showed adult parasites in its mesenteric veins and none in the liver which is a matter of some interest. Attempts were made to study the life history of F. gigantica and gastrodiscus secundus, but the ova failed to hatch owing to fungus infection. Identification of the collection of Helminthes, etc., in the museum is in progress. It is interesting to record that in a bottle, dated 1923 there were a few diplophylidium nolleri skrajabin, 1924, collected from a cat. This parasite has not been reported from this part of the country. Another tape- worm which appears to be an undescribed one is under investigation. A sample of this specimen has been sent to Professor Leiper, London School of Tropical Medicine, for his opinion. A paper on " Heterrophyes indicum ", a new species from the dog and one on " some observation on trypanosomiasis in the Madras Presidency " were read during the session of the All-India Veterinary Conference held at Bangalore in December 1930, presided over by Col. O. Olver, Animal Husbandry Expert with the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research. VII.41 and animal-owners in particular, the activities of the depart- ment by means of charts, diagrams, lantern lectures, etc. A Veterinary Assistant Surgeon from the College was deputed to (1) the Missionaries' Conference held at Kodaikanal, (2) the Industrial and Agricultural Exhibition at Chit- toor, and (3) the Annual Cattle Fair and Festival, Mailam. As usual, the College participated in the Annual Health and Baby Week Exhibition held in the S.I.A.A. grounds under the auspices of the Corporation of Madras. Besides the completion of four sets, each consisting of 200 magic lantern slides for supply to the District Veterinary Officers, for exhibition in the agricultural motor van touring in their districts, cattle fairs and shows and other public gatherings, 241 slides and captions were also prepared. As many as 100 prints were taken for propaganda work. The work of preparing and supplying each District Veterinary Officer with a set of magic lantern slides is under proposal. M.R.Ry. V. Krishnamurti Ayyar Avargal attended the Indian Science Congress held at Nagpur during the year. M.R.Ry. K. Kailasam Ayyar Avargal delivered a course of lectures to the students of the B.S.Sc. and Health Officers' classes on " Diseases of animals in relation to Public Health " at the Madras Medical College. The quarterly inspection of the City Police horses and stables were carried out and advice given as and when required. VIII.42 Expenditure. 1929-30. 1930-31. Rs. A. P. Rs. A. P.

I.44 4. During the year 3,092 animals were inoculated by the serum simultaneous method against rinderpest in this circle. II.45 were dispensed with by the Raja Sahib of Parlakimedi, is treat- ing cases, and also doing castration work in the town as well as in the surrounding villages. Owing to frequent change of incumbents and to the introduction of fees there was also a fall at the Veterinary Hospital, Vizagaptam. 9. During the year under report the following additions and improvements were made or were under construction :46 (b) Itinerating. 10. On the 31st March 1931 there were 12 Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons attached to this circle. One touring billet was newly opened on 1st May 1930 at Bobbili for Bobbili, Salur and Parvatipur taluks. 11. The headquarters of the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Russellkonda Agency, attached to the Special Assist- ant Agent, Russellkonda, was changed from Russellkonda to Ghumsur-Udayagiri. The office of the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Ghumsur-Udayagiri, was opened on the forenoon of 6th September 1930 at Ghumsur-Udayagiri. The office of the Touring Veterinary Assistant Suregon, Russell- konda Agency, was closed on the afternoon of 4th September 1930. 12. A comparative statement of the work done by the touring staff during the years 1929-30 and 1930-31 is given below :47 with the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons and arranged serum simultaneous inoculations. The disease was very severe in Ghumsur, Aska, Kudala, Surada, Berhampur, Chatrapur and Ichapur taluks in Ganjam district. 14. The Cattle Disease Act was enforced in the taluks of Ghumsur, Aska, Kudala, Surada, Berhampur, Chatrapur and Ichchapur in Ganjam district for a period of six months from 13th November 1930. Serum alone inoculations and serum simultaneous inoculations were carried out to prevent the spread of the disease. Prosecutions were filed against 75 persons in two villages by the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Aska, for having refused compulsory inoculation under the enforcement of the Act. The results of action taken by the Magistrate have not yet been communicated. 15. During the year six animals were inoculated against rinderpest by the serum alone method and 3,092 by the serum simultaneous method. Of the inoculations done by the latter method, 2,101 were done in Vizagapatam district and 991 in Ganjam district. The serum simultaneous method of inoculations is gradually becoming more and more popular. With the greatest difficulty serum simultaneous inoculations were performed in Ganjam district up to Ghumsur taluk. 16. Anthrax.48 No inoculations were carried out against this disease. 19. Foot-and-mouth disease.49 31. Anti-rabic treatment.50 rigorous imprisonment and out of the fine each accused was ordered to pay a sum of Rs. 15 to the complainant as compensation. 39. Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act.51 Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge of vans in their res- pective divisions. Wide publicity was given to all the villages near to the halting place of the presence of the motor units. During the day time the exhibits in the vans were exposed. Discourses in Telugu on common contagious diseases and their prevention, castration of bulls by Burdizzo's method, the feeding and rearing of cattle and calves, etc., were given to the people congregated, in addition to the distribution of pamphlets. Animals brought for different ailments were also treated and bulls castrated. In the evening magic lantern shows were arranged. The slides were explained to the ryots in popular Telugu. One hundred and sixty-two animals were treated for non- contagious diseases, one was treated for contagious disease, 203 animals were castrated. I was present with the van at Chodavaram and rendered help to the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons in all the activities of propaganda carried out there. Large numbers of the ryot population were present and a number of animals for treat- ment and castration were presented by them. At Dharakota from 27th September 1930 to 5th October 1930 an agricultural and industrial exhibition was held by the Raja Sahib of Dharakota for the benefit of his subjects. Opportunity was also given to this department to place before the people the activities of this department. A camp dis- pensary was opened for nine days at Dharakota by the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Aska and Berhampur, in front of the Raja's palace. Various kinds of instruments and appliances were exhibited and explained to the public. Lectures were also delivered on such veterinary matters as contagious cattle disease with the preventive and protective measures to be adopted and the important use of common bazaar drugs. Practical demonstration was also made of Burdizzo's castrator and the benefits of this new method of castration as compared with the other methods were explained to the ryots. It is gratifying to note that as the result of this pro- paganda work as many as 68 castrations were performed with the Burdizzo's castrator within a short period of nine days and 26 cases were treated. Lantern lectures were given in Oriya to the people con- gregated, on various infectious and contagious diseases.
52 *6th to 8th Oct. 193053 and one village officer was also fined for failing to submit registers. In two cases the village officers were given severe warning for slackness. I have also brought to the notice of the Collector, Ganjam district, the slackness on the part of the village munsifs at Mundumari, Khoilpalli, and Damo- darapalli of Aska taluk in maintaining cattle mortality registers correctly and for not communicating to the staff of this department, the reports regarding the prevalence of the cattle disease in their respective villages. The Collector took the necessary measures for the correct maintenance of cattle mortality registers and for communicating the reports to the touring staff concerned promptly. 46. Three thousand and eleven (3,011) castrations were done by the staff in the whole circle with the Burdizzo castrator against 1,657 of last year. The increase is to an extent due to the increase in the number of castrators sup- plied. This method of castration is becoming more and more popular among the ryots. 47. Cattle mortality registers in municipalities.54 The Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge of the Veterinary Hospital, Berhampur, examined ten specimens received from the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons and 85 specimens pertaining to the hospital. I have also examined the specimens. 51. Veterinary Assistant Surgeons' work.55 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE DISTRICT VETERINARY OFFICER, RAJAHMUNDRY, FOR THE YEAR 1930-31. I.56 7. I selected two suitable private buildings for the location of the Veterinary Dispensaries, Razole and Tanuku, which were newly opened on 1st September 1930. Sites were also selected by me for the construction of permanent buildings for the location of the veterinary institutions at Palacole and Draksharam. The question of acquisition of site and construction of permanent buildings at Draksharam, had to be dropped for the present on account of financial stringency. I visited Tadepalligudem of West Godavari district, to enquire as to its suitability for the opening of a veterinary dispensary in preference to Pentapadu. 8. During the year under report, 18,506 animals were protected by serum simultaneous method of inoculation against rinderpest. 9. The Circle Office was inspected by the Director of Veterinary Services, Madras, during the year in the month of February 1931. II.57 13. (a) The work of putting up wire-fencing round the compound of the Veterinary Hospital, Cocanada, was not completed by the Public Works Department during the year. (b) Two combined thatched operation and dressing sheds were put up at the Veterinary Dispensaries, Razole and Tanuku. (c) One thatched in-patient shed and a breeding-bull shed and store-room were put up at the Veterinary Dispen- sary, Polavaram, at the end of March 1931, but the bull is yet to be sent. (d) The mud wall on the southern side of the compound of the Veterinary Hospital, Rajahmundry, was replaced by a pucca brick wall. 14. Two visiting committees were constituted, one for the Veterinary Dispensary, Polavaram, and the other for the Veterinary Dispensary, Bhadrachalam, with a view to popularizing the veterinary institutions. The recommenda- tions made by the members of the committees were duly considered and effect was given to them. In consequence of this, the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge of Veteri- nary Dispensary, Bhadrachalam, was asked to visit villages once a week within a radius of eight miles from Bhadrachalam and treat cases and do castrations. The Veterinary Assistant Surgeon performed 162 castrations and treated 236 cases during his visits to the villages. 15. As the average daily attendance at the Veterinary Dispensary, Polavaram, was below fifteen cases, the Veteri- nary Assistant Surgeon in charge of the institution was entrusted with the work of attending to outbreaks of cattle disease in Polavaram taluk, in addition to the dispensary work. The Veterinary Assistant Surgeons in charge of the newly opened veterinary institutions at Razole and Tanuku were also entrusted with additional work of attendance of outbreaks of cattle diseases in the taluks in which they were situated. 16. The total number of cases treated and castrations per- formed in all the institutions were 17,734 and 1,163, as against 15,032 and 770 respectively of the previous year. There was an appreciable increase of cases treated and castrations done, in all the institutions, except those at Bhadrachalam, Pithapuram and Palacole, where the amount of work done was almost the same as that of the previous 8
58 year. Only at the Veterinary Hospital, Pithapuram, was there a marked fall in the average daily attendance to 25.7 from 32.95 of the previous year. 17. Of the 1,163 castrations performed, 1,133 were done by the Burdizzo castrator. It is commendable that the Veteri- nary Hospital, Amalapuram, alone contributed 274 castra- tions by this method, which is the highest number. Next comes the Veterinary Dispensaries, Draksharam and Kotha- pet, where 179 and 175 respectively were done. 18. The number of cases supplied with medicine, but not brought to the institutions, was 2,491 during the year as against 2,229 of the previous year. 19. Consequent on the prevalence of rinderpest in a severe form during the year in Ramachandrapur taluk of East Godavari district, the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge of Veterinary Dispensary, Draksharam, was instruct- ed to conduct serum simultaneous inoculations in the sur- rounding villages whenever he was approached by the ryots with the request to carry out inoculations. He inoculated 995 bovines against the disease. The Veterinary Assistant Surgeons in charge of Veterinary Dispensaries, Palacole and Peddapuram, also did 368 and 133 inoculations respectively by the serum simultaneous method in the absence of Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons on leave. 20. The name of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, K. S. Prakasa Rao in charge of Veterinary Dispensary, Tanuku, deserves special mention. He opened the institution on 1st September 1930 and brought it rapidly to great prominence, the average daily attendance of the institution towards the end of the year being 54.22. The names of the other Veterinary Assistant Surgeons in charge of institutions, who deserve mention for good work are59 22. A comparative statement showing the work done by the itinerating staff of this circle during the years 1929-30 and 1930-31 is given below :60 this mortality, the number of deaths from this disease alone being 1,866 and 550 in East and West Godavari districts, respectively, against 2,931 and 5,795 of the previous year. 27. Rinderpest.61 2,273 of the previous year. Eighteen outbreaks were re- ported as against 39 of the last year. Seventeen outbreaks were attended to and the remaining one was not attended to, as the disease subsided with a few deaths. No inoculations were carried out against the disease, as it had subsided in most of the outbreaks before the Touring Veterinary Assist- and Surgeons could attend to them. 32. Hæmorrhagic septicæmia.62 35. Rabies.63 submitted specimens in 61 cases to the Principal, Madras Veterinary College, for microscopical examination for various diseases. Thirty-three specimens proved positive and twenty-eight negative. Of the thirty-three, which proved positive, one was for surra, six for Babesia bigeminum, six for Theileria species, one for Piroplasma canis, one for strangles, one for Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia, four for bacillus pyocyaneus, one for pappiloma, one for dermoid growth, one for epithelioma, two for chronic inflammatory tissue, one for melanoma, one for lymphadenoma, and one for anchy- lostomiasis. 45. Microscopical work.64 As the oil-immersion lens of the microscope at the Veteri- nary Hospital, Ellore, was out of order almost throughout the year, a larger number of specimens could not be examined by the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon. Several specimens were examined by me either at headquarters or in camp, but no record of them was kept in this office for a major portion of the year and the microscopical work shown in the state- ment against the "District Veterinary Officer" does not dis- close the whole work done by him during the year.

I.69 Most of the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons have failed to take the opportunity to castrate bulls till the end of October 1930. Therefore I toured with several of the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons for a few days to instruct them on castration propaganda. Thus during the year under report, 2,219 castrations ere done70 4. The District Veterinary office was inspected by the Director of Veterinary Services on 24th February 1931.

Propaganda.76 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE DISTRICT VETERINARY OFFICER, NELLORE, FOR THE YEAR 1930-31. I.77 Veterinary College. In addition to the above number, 142 inoculations by serum alone method were also performed against this disease. 4. During the year the veterinary dispensaries at Proddatur and Rajampet were removed to the new rented buildings as the old ones were found to be unsuitable. 5. During the period of my stay at headquarters I fre- quently visited the Veterinary Hospital, Nellore, and gave professional advice and assistance to the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge. II.78 castrations performed, as many as 269 were done at the Veteri- nary Dispensary, Rajampet, and 104 were performed at the Veterinary Dispensary, Cuddapah. The names of Messrs. N. K. Viswanadhan and M. A. Gaffur, who were respectively in charge of these institutions, deserve special mention here. (b) Two hundred and eighty-eight major and 577 minor operations were also performed in addition, at the several institutions in the circle. 13. The total number of cases supplied with medicine but not brought to the institutions was 463. Steps are being taken to discourage this practice and put a stop to it gradually. 14. A comparative statement showing the work done at the several institutions is appended below :79 castrations done by this section of the staff during the current year has been three times the number performed during last year. 18. A comparative statement showing the work done by the touring staff during the current year and the preceding one is given below :80 20.

Ephemeral fever.84 (b) Six sheep and ten goats were wholly condemned by the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge of the Veterinary Dispensary, Venkatagiri. Three sheep and six goats were partly condemned by the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge of the Veterinary Hospital, Nellore, being unfit for human consumption. (c) The three municipalities of Nellore, Cuddapah and Proddatur, which have adopted the by-laws relating to cattle mortality, have been regularly reporting outbreaks of disease and the figures for mortality. (d) Lethal Chamber.85 care to be taken in nursing animals in health and disease, on the causes and prevention of contagious diseases, and on ani- mal hygiene and husbandry. Songs composed by me on several important subjects such as castration, cattle diseases, etc., were sung. One of these was also published by the department. Magic lantern lectures were also delivered on important occasions. Pamphlets on many important veteri- nary subjects were distributed. Scrub bulls and other male stock not required and not suitable for breeding purposes were castrated. It was advised that cows which are bad breeders and those that are unsuitable for stud purposes be got rid of, as these tend to interfere to a great extent with the produc- tion of healthy livestock. I also laid stress on the importance of serum simultaneous inoculation against rinderpest and castration by Burdizzo method. Cattle-owners were also advised on the scientific methods of feeding of cows and calves. The ryots were also advised to decrease the number of their bullocks and to improve the condition of the few they may absolutely require to keep. V.86 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE DISTRICT VETERINARY OFFICER, BELLARY, FOR THE YEAR 1930-31. I.87 No new dispensary was opened during the year. The Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge of the Veterinary Dis- pensary at Nandikotkur had touring work till 6th February 1931, when he received orders exempting him from touring and Nandikotkur taluk has been added to the jurisdiction of the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Kurnool. The portion of the touring work done by the above Veterinary Assistant Surgeon is shown under the work done by the itinerating staff. 11. The number of in and out-patients treated and castra- tions performed at all the institutions in this circle was 9,050 as against 9,159 of the previous year. 12. Of 712 castrations done at the institutions, 704 were done by Burdizzo's castrator. One hundred and seventy-four cases were supplied with medicines without their being brought to the institutions as against 321 of the previous year. 13. During the year under report the following buildings were constructed :88 18. Castrations.89 25. Nine thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine inocula- tions by the serum simultaneous method were done during the year. It is worthy to mention that Veterinary Assistant Sur- geon K. S. Ramachandran conducted serum simultaneous inoculations for the first time in the Markapur division. Serum simultaneous inoculations have been carried out successfully in spite of the illiteracy and stubborn unwillingness of the ryots of those parts. There is not the least doubt that the serum simultaneous method of inoculation has come to stay in this circle and will be in great demand in future. 26. Anthrax.90 35. Strangles:91 44. Inspection of Government livestock.92 50. The following recommendations made in the report of the Royal Commission on Agriculture regarding the depart- ment have been carried out during the year under report. (a) Discontinuance of inoculations by serum alone method. (b) Conducting inoculations by serum simultaneous method. (c) Emasculating scrub bulls, rams and other male ani- mals with the Burdizzo's castrator as far as practicable. 51. Out of the total number of castrations done during the year, viz., 1,237 in the circle, 1,192 were done by Bur- dizzo's castrator. 52. The work of the office staff was satisfactory. A. K. MITRA, District Veterinary Officer, Bellary.
93 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE DISTRICT VETERINARY OFFICER, MADANAPALLE, FOR THE YEAR 1930-31. I.94 Government cattle at the Agricultural Farm, Kalahasti. He attended the cattle fair at Tenegallu in Anantapur district. He conducted post-mortem examinations on sheep when on tour with the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Ananta- pur, in December 1930 and found that death was due to hæmonchus contortus and advised the necessary treatment. He also tried the indigenous drug supplied by Mr. Sashital on 14 cases of rinderpest in two outbreaks in the village of Ramayyagaripalle and Perumalpalle of Chandragiri taluk in Chittoor district. Of the seven animals treated at Ramayya- garipalle it is reported that six got over the attack and one died from the disease, while at Perumalpalle it is reported that four recovered and three died. He also assisted the Veteri- nary Assistant Surgeons in conducting inoculations by serum simultaneous method in some of the villages affected with rinderpest. 6. Since taking charge I was on tour in my division for 21 days. I inspected the field work of the Touring Veteri- nary Assistant Surgeons of Madanapalle, Chandragiri and the Additional Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Puttur, and con- ducted non-detailed inspection of the veterinary institutions of Battuvaripalle and Madanapalle and made proposals to the Director of Veterinary Services, Madras, in regard to the site and construction of the permanent buildings for the veteri- nary hospital at Vijilapuram. I also attended the Fourth Chit- toor District Co-operative Conference held in Chittoor where I arranged for a veterinary exhibition in connexion with the Conference. I also conducted serum simultaneous inocula- tions with the Madras serum at Ponpadi village in Tiruttani taluk. 7. In addition to the above tour, I attended the meeting of the Board of Studies in Agriculture of the Madras Univer- sity held at Coimbatore, was an examiner for the B.Sc. Examination in Agriculture of the Madras University and served as a member of the Board of Examiners to conduct the Madras Veterinary College annual examinations. 8. During my tour in Chandragiri and Puttur divisions I had discussions with the Tahsildars of the respective divi- sions concerning the mortality of cattle in their jurisdictions and devoted my time to visiting villages affected with rinder- pest and in helping and supervising the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons in their inoculation work. In each of the villages I visited, the ryots were seen by me and I explained the efficacy of inoculations and the necessity of prompt reporting of cattle diseases. Information necessary for an epidemio- logical study of rinderpest was gathered by me at each of
95 these villages. The procedure that had been in vogue for maintaining records of the animals inoculated by the serum simultaneous method by the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons and the expenditure of serum and virus were examined and a separate report on the subject was submitted to the Director of Veterinary Services, Madras. At each of the institutions I visited, opportunity was taken to examine the cases that were treated at the institutions and advice in regard to the treatment of cases was given by me. 9. The opportunity also occurred at the Veterinary Hos- pital, Madanapalle, for treating a case of foot-and-mouth with Lugol's solution. The professional note books maintained at the institutions were examined by me and instructions given in the matter of recording cases of interest. 10. The District Veterinary Office was inspected by the Director of Veterinary Services, Madras, in January 1931. II.96 All the institutions in the circle contributed towards the increase. 14. The number of cases supplied with medicine but not brought to the institutions was 257 as against 788 in the previous year, the institution at Madanapalle contributing only 63 as against 686 in the previous year. The large increase in the number of cases to which medicines were supplied in the previous year has been reported to be due to the wide spread incidence of rinderpest and foot-and-mouth diseases that have prevailed in the taluk. 15. Seven hundred and sixty-six castrations were per- formed during the year as against 547 in the previous year. Of this number, 746 were performed by Burdizzo's castrator. 16. During the year under review, the construction of quarters for Assistant Surgeons in charge of veterinary hos- pitals of Chittoor and Madanapalle was sanctioned and the work at both these places was commenced in the year and is in progress. 17. The question of providing a microscopical room and a store room for the Veterinary Hospital, Madanapalle, is under consideration. 18. A kangayam breeding bull has been stationed at the Veterinary Hospital, Madanapalle, under the management of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge of the veterinary hospital. (b) Touring establishments. 19. On the 31st March 1931 there were seven touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons excluding the Additional Veteri- nary Assistant Surgeon and one Probationary Veterinary Assistant Surgeon. The Veterinary Assistant Surgeons in charge of veterinary institutions of Hindupur and Tadpatri were deputed to attend the weekly shandies held in their respective centres. 20. The following statement gives the number of cases treated and castrations performed during the year as com- pared with the previous year. 97 21. From the above table, it will be seen that there is a slight fall in cases treated under contagious and non-contagi- ous diseases and this was due to the fact that Veterinary Assistant Surgeons were mostly engaged in combating rinder- pest and conducting inoculations and also to the fact that the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons of Anantapur and Gooty were on leave in the months of December and January and no substitutes were appointed in their places. 22. Out of a total of 1,803 castrations performed, 1,625 were done by Burdizzo's castrator. III98 The disease was very severe in Chandragiri taluk and Puttur and Tiruttani sub-taluks in Chittoor district and this necessitated the posting of an Additional Veterinary Assistant Surgeon to the sub-taluks from the 12th October 1930. Seven thousand eight hundred and twenty inoculations were performed in these taluks alone to combat the disease. The total number of inoculations performed during the year under report was 17,169 as against 12,548 in the previous year. This appreciable increase would have been still greater had the supply of serum been steady throughout the year. 24. Black quarter.99 28. Other contagious diseases.100 The Veterinary Assistant Surgeons in charge of veterinary institutions of Anantapur and Madanapalle have examined in addition 43 and 25 specimens respectively for diagnosis of diseases of animals brought to the institutions in their charge. V.101 intended for the ryots, shepherds and labourers. He often spoke to the people gathered there in classes, on veterinary matters exhibiting some of the useful and common instru- ments. He arranged and took part in a series of lantern lectures on agriculture, co-operation and cognate subjects for the benefit chiefly of the agricultural population of the town. With the help of the lantern slides and assisted by the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Anantapur, he delivered a series of six lectures on anthrax and kindred subjects in the different parts of the town much to the benefit of the ryot population. On the occasion of the fourth Chittoor District Co-opera- tive Conference in the month of February 1931 a veterinary section was arranged by me with the help of the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, K. S. Krishnaswami, the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge of the Veterinary Hospital, Chittoor, and Mr. Viswanathan, Veterinary Assis- tant Surgeon deputed from the Madras Veterinary College. The exhibition was opened on the morning of the 22nd February 1931 by the Honourable Minister for Public Works. The veterinary section was visited by the Hon'ble Minister the same morning. In this section arrangements were made to exhibit in the form of actual specimens, photographs, charts and lantern slides, the most common diseases pre- valent among cattle in India, and the. several research acti- vities conducted in this Presidency relating to some of the widely prevalent conditions in cattle especially those im- portant from the public health point of view. The methods of combating these diseases by the use of sera and vaccines which were exhibited on the occasion were explained to the visitors. To give an idea to the public of Chittoor of the census of livestock in their district and the extent of cattle mortality occurring therein, suitable charts and graphs were prepared for the occasion and explained to the visitors. On the evening of the 22nd February a lantern demon- stration was given by me and this was attended by the Hon'ble the Chief Minister and the Minister for Public Works. As this demonstration was found very popular, it was repeated again on the 24th February 1931 to a large gathering. The Exhibition Committee of the Conference awarded a gold medal certificate to the department and added that the show was unprecedented in this district.
102 The Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge of the Veteri- nary Hospital, Battuvaripalle, by visiting village after village, day after day, for a continuous period of two months did propaganda work on a large scale by educating the ryots on all veterinary matters on the lines of the recommendations laid down by the Royal Commission on Agriculture. 42.

I attended the opening function of the American Arcot Mission Agricultural Institute near Katpadi performed by the Chief Minister. 6. I attended the Veterinary Hospital, Vellore, frequently during my stay at headquarters and rendered professional aid and gave advice in the treatment of cases whenever neces- sary. When in camp I took every opportunity to render similar aid to the staff and to demonstrate the use of the Burdizzo castrator to the ryots. 7. The Circle Office was inspected by the Director of Veterinary Services, Madras, on 2nd March 1931. II.105 14. Six hundred and seventeen castrations were performed during the year as against 550 in the previous year; of these 510 were done by the Burdizzo method. 15. An all round increase in the number of admissions, castrations and daily average attendance is observed at the veterinary institutions at Vellore, Salem, Krishnagiri and Tiruchengode. Of these Krishnagiri and Salem stand well to the front. The keen interest evinced by Veterinary Assistant Surgeons V. Periaswami and A. R. Venkatachala Ayyar in their respective charges, in a great measure, accounts for this satisfactory progress. A comparative statement of the number of admissions, castrations and daily average attend- ance of these two institutions is appended below :106 19. Veterinary Assistant Surgeon T.

V.112 (2) That the immunity set up in animals protected as adults did not wear off even at two years and three months after the inoculation. (3) That a calf protected four months ago re-acted, though in a very mild form. This combined with the fact that mortality amongst the protected young stock on this farm three years ago, when there was a natural outbreak of rinderpest, was severe and also of the fact that the mortality in the annual serum simultaneous inoculations is also confined to young calves, as expected, leaves room to doubt the permanency of immunity set up in young calves. 55.

The Veterinary Assistant Surgeons in charge of veteri- nary institutions, Tiruvannamalai, Vellore and Ranipet, deli- vered lectures on veterinary matters at the ryots' conferences held in their towns. 70. I, along with the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Namakkal, visited Paramatti, a village in Namakkal taluk when the motor exhibition van was halting there, and did some propaganda work. VI.115 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE DISTRICT VETERINARY OFFICER, MADRAS, FOR THE YEAR 1930-31. I.116 7. One case of surra in a mare was examined by me and destroyed at Saidapet, compensation having been paid. Another case of surra reported by the Principal, Madras Veteri- nary College, was investigated with the result that the affected animal was not brought back to Saidapet but it was disposed of in Madras City. 8. The slaughter-house at Conjeeveram was inspected and necessary instructions for the improvement of the building were given. 9. During February 1931, the Hon'ble Minister visited the dispensary at Conjeeveram inspected the site selected for constructing permanent buildings. II.[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Plate No. 4.117 16. Owing to the prevalence of rinderpest, the Veteri- nary Assistant Surgeon in charge of the Veterinary Dispensary, Chingleput, attended to the outbreak reports of Chingleput taluk till 27th April 1930. The Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge of the Veterinary Dispensary, Kallakurichi, continued to attend to the outbreak reports of Kallakurichi taluk throughout the year. The Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge of the Veterinary Dispensary, Tiruvallur, was attending to the outbreak reports of Tiruval- lur taluk from the beginning of the year till 10th July 1930 when he was temporarily exempted for six months. Since 13th February 1931 he has been permanently exempted from touring work as the institution showed considerable progress during the period of temporary exemption. The Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge of the Veterinary Dispensary, Chidambaram, was exempted temporarily from attending to the outbreak reports. 17. The members of the Visiting Committee visited the Veterinary Dispensary, Tiruvallur, on several days and sug- gested proposals for the improvement of the same. (b) Touring establishment. 18. On 31st March 1931 there were six permanent tour- ing billets, one having been opened at Conjeeveram on 27th April 1930. The second Veterinary Assistant Surgeon attached to the Veterinary Hospital, Saidapet, attended to the outbreak reports of Saidapet taluk as usual. There was one additional Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in Conjee- veram taluk from 1st April to 26th April 1930. 19. The staff have performed 1,573 castrations as against 822 of the previous year. Out of the former, 1,518 were done by Burdizzo method. 20. There is a considerable decrease in the number of con- tagious cases treated during tours and a perceptible increase in the number of non-contagious cases treated, as is seen from the comparative figures furnished below :118 21. The headquarters of the Touring Veterinary Assis- tant Surgeon, Villupuram, was moved to Tindivanam in February 1931 as the latter station is more central. 22. In connexion with the identification of the prevail- ing ticks in the Madras Presidency, the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons, Cuddalore and Conjeeveram, were re- gularly sending once a month ticks found on bovines, to the Principal, Madras Veterinary College. III.119 cases were treated by Chemotherapy and Veterinary Assistant Surgeon T. A. Ratnaswami Ayyar who treated the cases re- ports that the sufferings were reduced to the minimum. 27. Anthrax.120 35.

The Veterinary Dispensary at Lalgudi was moved to another rented building which was selected by me. I selected a site for the construction of the permanent building for the Veterinary Dispensary at Mayavaram. 8. The District Veterinary Office was inspected by the Director of Veterinary Services, Madras, in the month of August 1930. II.125 (c) Veterinary Hospital, Kumbakonam.126 fairs held at Samayapuram in Trichinopoly district and at Neerathanallur in Tanjore district. There were no prosecu- tions under the Act. 20.

I.131 were delivered; charts of scientific interest, samples of sera and vaccines and photos of various operations were also exhibited. An animal show was conducted by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals at Kodaikanal during May 1930. Quite a variety of animals were on view including bandy bullocks, pack-ponies, dhoby donkeys, milch cows, calves, dogs, fowls, etc. Of the various classes opened for competi- tion, I was one of the judges. There was an outbreak of glanders among ponies in Pan- naipuram village, Periyakulam taluk, Madura district. I tested 32 ponies with mallein. Four animals declared positive for glanders were destroyed under the Act. An investigation of Theileriasis at Kodaikanal was under- taken by me during the month of March 1931, with Veterinary Assistant Surgeon V. P. Subbiah in charge, Veterinary Dis- pensary, Madura City, to assist me in the investigation. Details of the investigation with the results are mentioned under "Bacteriological work" During the year, 7,164 animals were protected by the serum simultaneous method of inoculation against rinderpest of which eleven bovines belonged to the Government Agricultural Farm at Koilpatti and the rest belonged to the ryots. Virus for inoculation was obtained from the Madras Veterinary College and local virus was also used whenever virus was not available at the College. In addition, 121 serum alone method of inocu- lations against rinderpest, 109 serum alone method of inoculations against hæmorrhagic septicæmia, 61 sero-aggres- sin and 15 serum alone method of inoculations against black quarter were conducted. Ninety fowls were protected against pseudo-fowl-pest with the vaccine from the Madras Veterinary College. A tabular statement showing the quantities of the different kinds of sera, aggressin and vaccine and virus used is appended below :132 II.133 when compared with that of the previous year. The figures of daily average and castrations in the veterinary institutions at (Tallakulam) Madura and Veerakeralampudur show an increase but a slight fall in the number of admissions is observed. The fall in the former is attributed to the opening of a veterinary dispensary in the heart of Madura City, while in the latter the fall is attributed to the absence of foot-and-mouth disease which prevailed in a severe form in and around Veerakeralam- pudur during the previous year as a result of which a large number of cases were received for treatment. An increase in the number of admissions but a slight fall in the daily average and castrations is observed in the Veterinary Dispensary at Kodaikanal. The decrease is attributed to the small number of Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals' cases re- manded to the infirmary for treatment. A slight fall under admissions and castrations and an increase in the daily average are noticed in the veterinary institutions at Virudhunagar, Sivakasi and Tuticorin. The fall under admissions in the Veterinary Dispensary at Virudhunagar is attributed to the illegal collection of tolls for unladen sick animals brought to the institution for treatment contrary to the orders of the Special Officer in charge of the municipality and partly to the civil disobedience movement in those parts. Owing to the pre- valence of rinderpest in a severe form in Sattur taluk of Ramnad district, the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge, Veterinary Dispensary, Sivakasi, was engaged in the constant attendance of outbreaks. Consequently the dispensary had to be closed during these periods and hence the fall in the number of admissions. The change of location of the Veterinary Dis- pensary at Tuticorin coupled with the distance of the veterinary dispensary from the heart of the town is said to be responsible for the slight fall in the number of admissions. The figures of admission, daily average attendance and castrations are satisfactory for the newly opened dispensary at Srivilliputtur. A temporary waiting shed and an operation shed have been constructed at each of the veterinary institutions at Tuticorin and Srivilliputtur. A dressing shed was also put up at the Veterinary Dispensary, Devakottah. Veterinary Assistant Surgeons, K. R. Lakshminarayana Ayyar, Veerabahu Pillai and Parameswara Menon deserve special mention for good work. (b) Itinerating Staff. A new touring billet was opened in Tinnevelly district from 1st May 1930 with headquarters at Nanguneri. There were in all ten touring billets. The touring billet of Ambasamudram
134 division remained vacant from 13th November 1930 to 3rd December 1930 and no Veterinary Assistant Surgeon was posted to hold additional charge of the billet. The touring billet of Nanguneri was vacant from 7th September 1930 to 6th October 1930 and the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Tinnevelly, was holding additional charge of the billet. The Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Srivilliputtur, opened the Veterinary Dispensary at Srivilliputtur and as no hand was available, this touring billet remained closed from 1st Sep- tember 1930 to 13th October 1930 and the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Paramakudi, was in additional charge of this division. The touring billet of Paramakudi division had to be closed from 15th November 1930 to 22nd January 1931 when the permanent incumbent proceeded on medical leave: the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Sivaganga, was asked to attend to outbreaks of contagious diseases in that division. A comparative statement of the work done by the touring staff is appended below :135 III.136 There had been in all nine deaths among the animals inoculated by serum simultaneous method. The five deaths shown in column (2) are said to be due to excessive reaction, and the four deaths shown in column (4) are said to be due to piroplasmosis. There was no opportunity to treat this. In view of the prevalence of rinderpest in a severe form in Madura district during the early part of the year under report it was necessary to enforce the provisions of the Cattle Disease Act of 1866 in the whole of Madura district from 1st April 1930 to 30th June 1930 both days inclusive. In the month of January 1931 the provisions of the said Act were enforced in Melur taluk for a period of three months and temporary dispensaries and hospital pounds were opened at Natham and Melur to control the spread of the disease. From 6th March 1931 till the close of the current official year the provisions of the Act were enforced in Periyakulam taluk of Madura district. Cases of rinderpest treated with intravenous injection of iodine (tincture iodine in 2 to 4 drachms doses diluted with four times distilled water) in the early stages, proved effective in the majority of cases. Anthrax.137 Tuberculosis.138 College vaccine at Kodaikanal, it is said that only four of the vaccined fowls did not get the infection, while the fowls pro- tected at Palamcottah were reported to be keeping good health and that they did not get the infection. In addition, the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge, Veterinary Dispensary, Kodaikanal, protected 88 country fowls with vaccine prepared by Dr. Turkhud of Kodaikanal in doses of 1 to 2 c.c. according to size of the bird and it is said that 56 were successfully protected. Three injections were given when the poultry was exposed to the infection. The same vaccine used a year back was not successful. The high percentage of success seen this year may perhaps be due to the low vitality of the vaccine owing to the long inter- val between the preparation and actual use. Rabies.139 Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.140 fairs. The provisions of the Cattle Disease Act of 1866 were enforced in all the fairs excepting the one held at Sembatti village from 4th July 1930 to 6th July 1930. Twenty-one weekly cattle fairs were also attended to by the staff. No pony fair was held during the year. Cases of unusual interest.141 V.142 Visiting Committees.[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Plate No. 5.143 The Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons of Tinnevelly, Koilpatti and Nanguneri divisions, conducted propaganda work in annual cattle fairs in their respective jurisdictions, and the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons at Paramakudi and Ambasamudram also conducted propaganda work in weekly cattle fairs in their respective divisions. The Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge, Veterinary Dispensary, Dindi- gul, attended the weekly cattle markets at Dindigul and spoke to the ryots on the advantages of veterinary aid. During Panguni festival at Virudhunagar which attracted ryots from all the adjoining villages the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge, Veterinary Dispensary, Virudhunagar, carried on propaganda work by distributing various leaflets on veterinary matters. Every effort was made to popularize the importance and benefit of veterinary aid. Government livestock.144 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE DISTRICT YETERI NARY OFFICER, COIMBATORE, FOR THE YEAR 1930-31. I.145 made out against the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon and a detailed report was duly sent to the Collector. 6. Whenever on an interior tour, I either made it a routine to speak to the boys and teachers at village schools myself, on animals in health and in disease, or, made the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons speak to them. In this way, a certain amount of propaganda work has always been undertaken by me in my interior tours. 7. I selected a building for the location of the Veterinary Dispensary, Kollegal, and sites for the construction of per- manent buildings for the veterinary institutions at Gobichetti- palaiyam and Dharapuram. 8. While at headquarters, I visited the Veterinary Hos- pital almost daily and the Veterinary Hospital attached to the Agricultural College frequently and rendered such profes sional help to the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons as was necessary from time to time. 9. I was a presiding officer in one of the polling stations at Coimbatore for the Madras Legislative Council elections. 10. During the year, I was also the Honorary Veterinary Surgeon of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Ani- mals, Coimbatore. 11. At the request of the Municipal Chairman, Coimba- tore, I examined a few bullocks of the municipality and declared them to be unfit for further service either or. account of old age or disease and recommended their sale or destruction. 12. During the year, under instructions from the Director of Veterinary Services, I selected a pair of Kangayam bul- locks (big variety) at the Pattagar's farm at Palayakottai for the Government Mental Hospital, Madras. 13. The District Veterinary office was inspected by the Director of Veterinary Services, Madras. II.146 (a) Hospitals and Dispensaries. 15. There were ten veterinary institutions in this circle at the end of the year. This number includes the one opened at Kollegal in January 1931. 16. A comparison of the figures of work done in all the veterinary institutions in this circle during the year with those of the preceding year reveals a considerable increase of work as will be seen in the table furnished infra. Year. Cases treated. Cases castrated. 1929-30 .. .. .. 16,790 279 1930-31 .. .. .. 18,167 368 The increase of work done .. 1,377 89 17. There is a fall in the daily average attendance at the dispensary at Nathakadayur and the same is attributed to the large number of animals mostly belonging to the Pattagar of Palayakottai having been at work during the season immedi- ately after the rains in those parts this year. The very slight fall of figures at Coonoor and Ootacamund calls for no spe- cial remarks. 18. There were many interesting cases at some of the hospitals in this circle during the year. The following are some of them. (1) A ease of cystic calculus in a dog successfully ope- rated on and discharged cured by Veterinary Assistant Sur- geon R. Swaminatha Ayyar in charge Veterinary Hospital, Ootacamund. The stone weighed four ounces on removal and was about two inches in diameter. (2) A case of caesarean section in a cat in which the cat and one of the kittens inside which was removed alive, were discharged in perfect health after a week, at the Veteri- nary Hospital, Ootacamund, by Veterinary Assistant Surgeon R. Swaminatha Ayyar. (3) A case of extensive nasal growth and diseased su- perior turbinals in a bullock successfully operated on and discharged cured at the Veterinary Dispensary, Pollachi, by Veterinary Assistant Surgeon S. N. Tammayya, much to the satisfaction of the owner, an illiterate ryot. The growths re- moved were in volume two pounds bottleful.
[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Plate No. 6.147 (4) A case of cæsarean section in a cow at the Veteri- nary Dispensary, Gobichettipalayam, by Veterinary Assistant Surgeon K. S. Bhuvarahachari. In this case the mutilated foetus was successfully removed and the cow was doing quite well till the third day much to the satisfaction of the illiterate owner though the fact that it was brought in a cart from a village a few miles off with the foetus mutilated was much against a favourable prognosis of the case. (5) A case of cæsarean section in a goat at the Veteri- nary Dispensary, Dharapuram, by Veterinary Assistant Sur- geon M. R. Subrahmaniya Sastri. This was a case of extra uterine pregnancy and it was successfully operated on and the she-goat was discharged cured. (6) Three cases of epistaxis in bullocks were treated successfully with the internal administration daily for a few days of liquor calcis two ounces and spts. ætheris nitrosi one ounce and one pint of water. 19. Only 848 cases have been remanded to the various institutions for treatment under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act during the year as against 1,175 remands of last year. The District Magistrate, Coimbatore, has been request- ed to instruct the convicting magistrates under his control to remand to veterinary infirmaries animals that require care and treatment, instead of fining the owners of animals for cruelty and letting them off. 20. Buildings.148 (5) Provision of electric lights to the hospital and to the quarters of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon. 22. A store room and a compound wall on the northern side were constructed at the Veterinary Hospital, Tiruppur. 23. The cattle wards at the Veterinary Hospitals at Coim- batore and Erode have been extended. 24. A post-mortem shed is in building at the Veterinary Hospital, Coimbatore, and is nearing completion. 25. The site for the construction of permanent buildings at Dharapuram has been acquired during the year; and the same has been taken charge of by the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge, Veterinary Dispensary, Dharapuram. The necessary plans and estimates have been called for from the Public Works Department for the construction of dispensary buildings thereon. 26. The question of acquiring the site selected for per- manent buildings at Gobichettipalayam has been dropped at present. Arrangements are being made to rent the plot of ground adjacent to the veterinary dispensary building with the view to increasing the space in the compound. (b) Itinerating staff. 27. No new touring billet was opened during the year and there have been seven touring billets in the circle as in the previous year, and the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge Veterinary. Dispensary, Nathakadayur, continued to treat cases at the Kangayam Cattle Fair every Monday in addition to his dispensary work. 28. A comparative statement of cases treated and castra- tions performed by the touring staff is given below:149 29 Castrations by Burdizzo method.150 of inoculations and 50 animals were protected against black quarter by the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Kolle- gal, at Honamatti Estate by the sero-aggressin method of inoculations. 36. Foot-and-mouth disease.151 43. Details of microscopical work done by me and the staff.152 In addition to the 369 specimens and smears examined by the staff in this circle, 84 specimens and smears were exa- mined by me under the microscope. Of these 84 specimens nine were positive for diseases such as black-quarter, piro- plasmosis, fowl cholera, follicular mange, surra, etc., and the rest were negative. 44. Municipal.153 49. Cattle and pony breeding.154 54. Financial effects of the revised scale of fees.155 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE DISTRICT VETERINARY OFFICER, CALICUT, FOR THE YEAR 1930-31. I.156 II.157 fall is mainly attributed to the fact that the magistrates did not send all the animals to the institutions for treatment, but disposed of the cases by the imposition of fines, and the fact has been brought to the notice of the District Magistrate, and other members of the Society at one of the meetings at Calicut. 11. Buildings.158 Of the total number of 458 castrations, 404 were by Burdizzo method. From the figures it may be seen that this method is gaining popularity with the ryots, and will completely replace the other methods when each and every touring billet is supplied with a Burdizzo's castrator. All the 136 castrations performed by the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge of the Veterinary Dispensary, Puttur, on tour were by Burdizzo method, and out of the 102 castrations done by the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Manantoddy, 101 were by the same method. III.159 Owing to the persistent outbreaks of rinderpest the Cattle Diseases Act was put in force for a period of three months from 6th January 1931 in Karkal taluk. As a precautionary measure, the Act was enforced during the annual cattle fair at Kulgunda of South Kanara district from 3rd November 1930 to 24th November 1930. Four prosecutions were made in all under the Act, of which three resulted in fine, and one in acquittal. 17. Anthrax.160 26. Piroplasmosis.161 by the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge of the Veteri- nary Hospital, Mangalore, and 93 by the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge of the Veterinary Dispensary, Palghat, including those received from the staff in the districts. Fifty-nine specimens were examined by me, 29 indepen- dently, and 30 along with the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons in charge of the institutions. The latter number has been included in the figures of respective institutions. The Veterinary Dispensary at Palghat was provided with a microscope during the year, thus making the total number of institutions equipped with microscopes from two to three in the circle. 34. Criminal poisoning.162 40. The recommendations of the Royal Commission on Agriculture continued to be given effect to during the year. Inoculations by serum simultaneous method against rinderpest have completely replaced the serum alone method except where the Cattle Disease Act was in force, and this method is gaining popularity. The staff did propaganda work on the lines suggested by the Royal Commission on Agriculture whenever possible, and wherever found feasible. The staff accompanied the Agricultural Motor Van party, and did intensive propaganda work by distribution of depart- mental leaflets and lectures on veterinary matters and practical demonstrations by Burdizzo's castrator. 41.

During the year under report, the following officers were confirmed in the Madras Veterinary Service with effect from 1st August 1931: 4 The 264 posts were distributed as shown below during the year under report: 8 (3) Pathology, Bacteriology and Immunology. (4) Parasitology including Protozoology. (5) Pharmacology including Materia Medica. (6) Surgical Anatomy and Shoeing. Consequent on the introduction of the new curriculum in the first and second year classes, there has been during the year under report, a considerable improvement in the practical side of the instruction imparted to students. The lectures in different subjects were supplemented with practical classes and demonstra- tions with the aid of specimens and magic lantern slides. Although the final year students were taught under the old curri- culum, they were given ample opportunities to gain practical knowledge of clinical lectures and demonstrations and also by making it obligatory on their part to work in turn in important sections of the College, such as the clinical laboratory, rinderpest virus production section, etc. In order to bring home to the students the necessity for maintaining a proper record of post mortems, a printed notebook was introduced which each student of the second and third year classes was required to maintain. (c) Admission of Students. 7. The Committee appointed for the selection of candidates for admission to the College, met at Bezwada and Madias on 27th June 1931 and 30th June 1931, respectively, and selected 40 students in all for admission. The total strength of the first year class towards the close of the year was 46 including the failed students of the previous year who rejoined the class, Native State scholars and private paying students. Of these 46 students, 12 were scholarship-holders, 23 non-paying students and 11 pay- ing students. As regards the educational qualifications of these students, 13 were Intermediates and above, while the remaining 33 were S.S.L.C. holders declared eligible for the College course. Of the latter 33, thirteen had obtained 45 per cent of marks and above in English and twenty had less than 45 per cent in English. In the second and third year classes, there were 31 and 48 students respectively at the end of the year. Thus the total number of students undergoing the course in all the three classes at the College during the year, was 125, as against 117 of the previous year. The different communities to which these 125 students belonged are shown below: 6 (d) Professional Examinations. 8. The Board which conducted the annual professional exami- nations in the College in March 1931, recommended that students who failed in class ' B ' should be re-examined as a special case in June 1931, as otherwise with the introduction of the new curri- culum in this class in July 1931, these students would be compelled to study under the new conditions and that this would cause hard- ship and inconvenience. A special supplementary examination for these students was accordingly held with the sanction of Govern- ment in June 1931 and it was conducted by the Director of Veteri- nary Services and the Principal, Madras Veterinary College. Eleven students appeared for the examination and ail of them were declared successful. A supplementary examination was conducted by the Principal in October 1931 for four students of the first year class who failed in not more than one subject in the annual examination of March 1931 and who were provisionally promoted to the second year class. All the four students came out successful. The annual professional examinations of the College were held during the year, as usual, in March 1932 and were conducted by an Examining Board specially constituted for the purpose. The President and Members of the Board were7 (f) University Degree in Veterinary Science. 10. The question of the institution of a University Degree in Veterinary Science and the affiliation of the Madras Veteri- nary College to the University was taken up with the Madras University during the year. The Syndicate of the University referred the proposal to a select committee consisting of Dr. R. A. Lakshmanaswami Mudaliyar as convenor and Messrs. P. T. Saunders, V. Krishnamurti Ayyar, M. R. V. Panikkar, T. Murari and J. P. Manikkani as Members. The Committee met in July 1931 and after considering the proposal unanimously recom- mended to the Syndicate that steps should be taken to institute a degree in Veterinary Science and that the degree course should be so framed as to develop the basic sciences. The details of the scheme are being worked out by the Special Committee and when they are ready and after a decision is arrived at by the Univer- sity in the matter, the scheme will be submitted for the consi- deration of Government. (g) Hostel, Health and Athletics. 11. The new hostel buildings which were in the course of construction in the previous year, were completed and handed over to this department during the year. Mr. K. Kailasam Ayyar, Lecturer in Hygiene, was appointed Superintendent of the hostel and attended to the management of the hostel. The new hostel provides accommodation for 120 students, but only 89 students were in the hostel during the year under report. About the close of the year, Government while sanctioning a concessional rate of rent of Rs. 3 per mensem per student, issued orders that all students of the College except those residing with their parents or relations should reside in the hostel. This may result in the hostel accommo- dation being fully utilized in future years. Regarding messing arrangements, there were two sections, vegetarian and non-vegetarian, and they were managed by the representatives of the students themselves. The health of the students was uniformly good throughout the year and their conduct satisfactory. The athletic activities of the students were good. In addition to football, hockey, cricket, tennis and badminton, volley ball was introduced during the year. The College teams took part in the Inter-Collegiate and Wilson's Cup football tournaments. The annual College Day sports were con- ducted with the usual enthusiasm and success. (ii) Hospital. 12. Mr. M. R. V. Panikkar, Lecturer in Pharmacology, and Mr. K. S. Nayar, Lecturer in Surgery, were in charge of the medi- cal and surgical oases respectively of the Veterinary hospital attached to the Madras Veterinary College, and the hospital conti- nued to show satisfactory progress. There was an increase in the total number of admissions during the year as compared with the previous year, the figures for the two years 1931-32 and 1930-3J
8 being 4,680 and 3,794 respectively, but there has been a fall in the hospital receipts from lis. 4,875-12-6 in the previous year to lis. 4,303-15-0 in the year under report. The branch veterinary dispensary for out-patients at Rayapuram remained under the control of the Principal, Madras Veterinary College, throughout the year and continued to show satisfactory progress. The total number of cases treated at the institution increased to 2,958 during the year from 2,125 of the previous year. The daily average attendance at the dispensary for the year was 31.6 as against 31.3 in the previous year. Fifty-three cases of special interest were sent from this institution to the Madras Veterinary College for treatment. (iii) Shocing Forge. 13. The shoeing forge attached to the Madras Veterinary College was utilized, as usual, to give the students practical instruction in shoeing. The number of horses shod and the num- ber of shoes repaired at the forge during the year were 870 and 118 respectively as against 905 and 320 respectively in the previous year. The fall in the number of cases shod is mainly due to the general decrease in the number of horse-drawn vehicles in the city. There was a net profit of Rs. 441-9-9 in the working of the forge during the year. (iv) Laboratory. (a) Pathological and Bacteriological Section. 14. Mr. G. A. Ajwani, acting Lecturer in Pathology and Bacteriology, was in charge of this section from the beginning of the year till 30th November 1931, when Mr. V. Krishuamurti Ayyar, Professor of Pathology and Bacteriology, assumed charge of the section and continued to hold it till the end of the year. In the year under review, 1,288 specimens and other morbid materials were received for examination of which 480 were patho- logical and 808 bacteriological. This number excludes those that were examined as a routine in connexion with the post mortem examinations conducted on requisition from the wards. The specimens received and examined during the year are shown below: 9 Twenty samples of industrial material were received for exami- nation during the year and Anthrax infection was detected in 6 of them. 15. In the course of examination of the different materials that were received in the laboratory as well as of carcasses for post mortem examination, special mention deserves to be made of the following : 10 (b) Parasitological Section. 18. Mr. M. Anant Narayan Rao, Lecturer in Parasitology, continued to be in charge of this section throughout the year. The number of specimens, etc., received and examined in this section and the clinical laboratory during the year are noted below: 11 Thirty bottles of ectoparasites collected from cattle, horses, dogs and chickens contained the following: 12 The following protozon infections were detected in the calves during the period of observation: 13 breeds of cattle, climatic conditions, etc. The Special Rinderpest Officer was instructed to begin his investigation in the Ongele area and carry out the programme in all the six areas one after another in the order mentioned: 14 annum from its funds for a period of five years to each province, and with this amount the provinces are required to set up a disease investigation staff. During the year under report, definite proposals with details of the estimate of cost for working out the scheme in this Presidency were drawn up and forwarded to the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research for acceptance. As at present proposed, the scheme will be given effect to in this pro- vince from April 1933 and it is intended that the investigation officer to he appointed will continue the work of the Special Rinderpest Officer on the termination of his post at the end of March 1933. The investigation officer will also undertake the investigation of other important animal diseases requiring elucidation. (d) Research Work at the Madras Veterinary College Laboratory. 27. The following items of research work were in progress in the Pathological and Parasitological sections of the Laboratory attached to the Madras Veterinary College. 28. Anthrax.15 on this subject since that date. The Crithidia obtained from Tabanids at Ranipet and Kaveripakkam seem to conform to the description given by him, but the post-flagellate stage has not been observed. It may be that development had not advanced far enough to show these forms. It is interesting to note that of over 20 male Tabanus dissected, none of them showed Crithidia, while those females fed on blood showed the infection. Attempts were made to culture these Crithidia without success. A comparative study of these Crithidia and the cultural forms of the large trypanosomes of cattle (Trypanosoma theileri) shows that the curves of the percentage measurements of both of them are almost identical). It is premature to opine at this stage, whether these Crithidia are the developmental forms of Trypanosoma theileri, till biological experiments on calves are made. It was observed that a large number of cases of Trypanosomi- asis occurred during the hot weather, and that in one area at least the number of Tabanus was greatest during the hot weather. This fact is interesting because it seems to be contrary to the view that Trypanosomiasis is a disease found during or after rains. Very little information concerning the time of the year these flies abound in different districts of this Presidency exists and from the few observations made in Madras (Guindy) and in the Ranipet area, it would seem open to question that they appear just before and during the rains in this part of the Presidency. The transmission of Surra in laboratory animals with Conorhi- nus rabrofasiata has been taken up recently, the results of which will be made available later. Naganol was supplied in a few cases of Trypanosomiasis for treatment in the mufassal and the results were satisfactory. 31. Piroplasmosis16 Hepatazeon canis in addition to Piroplasma, but the Trypaflavine had no action on the Hepatazoa. (iv) Babesia gibsoni.17 The small metacarpal artery contributed towards the forma- tion of the sub-carpal arch (by giving off a small branch at the usual level), then continued down the metacarpus, received a large communicating branch from the large metacarpal artery and divided below this point of communication into two nearly equal branches which took the place of (external and internal) posterior interosseous metacarpal arteries. A branch from the external digital artery behaved in a manner similar to the lower unnamed branch of the large metacarpal artery. 34. The presence of the urachus was met with in a two-year old bull calf (demonstration subject). This urachus was found connecting the vertex of the bladder to the umbilicus. In another subject (a six-months old heifer calf) the urachus was still present. V.18 of outbreak reports and preparation and submission of monthly mortality returns and that the information required by this department, could be obtained by prescribing a simpler form of return for infectious diseases only which could be sent by village officers direct to the District Veterinary Officers or the local Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons. This suggestion of the Retrenchment Committee was consi- dered in detail and I have, in consultation with the District Veterinary officers and the Special Rinderpest Officer, come to the conclusion that the present practice with regard to the main- tenance of mortality registers by village munsifs and reporting of outbreaks through the Tahsildars should continue, as it ensures proper control of the work of the village officers by the higher Revenue officials, which seems to be essential. With regard to the compilation of monthly mortality statements, I was not of the opinion that any change in the present system was desirable. I have informed Government accordingly since the close of the year and their orders are awaited. 37. Most of the municipalities which adopted the by-laws relating to the control of animal diseases and the maintenance of cattle mortality registers, continued to work the by-laws satis- factorily and recorded outbreaks and mortality promptly. 38. Rinderpest.19 39. Anthrax.20 completely cured, the parasites in two of the cases having com- pletely disappeared. A pony which was also treated with an injection of Antimonium tartaratum followed by three injec- tions of Nagonal at intervals of a week, completely recovered. 46. Nasal Granuloma.21 most of the other cases have been satisfactory. As regards the 174 deaths most of these occurred within a week or ten days of vaccination. It is possible, therefore, that some at least of these were done during the period of incubation. Further investigation is necessary in this disease. 54. Skin diseases.22 medicine but not brought to institutions during the year, the figures for the two years 1931-32 and 1930-31 being 14,375 and 7,783 respectively. The leading institutions in the Presidency with the number of cases treated in each are shown below: 23 60. S.P.C.A.24 The motor exhibition vans of the Agricultural department were used, as far as possible, for veterinary propaganda work. 65. Fairs and shows.25 18 an important and necessary item in the future programme of development of the activities of the department. In view, how- ever, of the present financial stringency and the consequent need for keeping down the expenditure, it has been decided not to proceed with this scheme for the time being. The question will be taken up when financial conditions improve. 71. Education.26 APPENDIX I. Statement showing the number of deaths from contagious diseases among animals during the year 1931-32.

The ques- tion of affiliating the college to the Madras University is under consideration. There is an immense field for veterinary work in the country which can never be covered by a Government depart- ment and the importance of assisting and preparing young men to enter the profession outside Government service, provided an effective demand for their skill can be induced, is manifest. 4. Research.8 No. 1350, DEVELOPMENT, 15TH OCTOBER 1932 3,442 were attended to, the remainder having presumably subsided before the staff were free to visit the locality. The importance of pursuing the investigation, even after an out- break has subsided, should not be lost sight of The number of reports was considerably less than in 1930-31 (when it was 5,664) but it is of course impossible to say exactly whether the reports covered all the cases resulting in deaths (which, as we have seen, was over 56,000), or whether the reporting was defective. Rinderpest was, as usual, responsible for about half the deaths, and the districts of Guntur, Nellore, Kurnool and North Arcot, show the highest figures of disease; but it cannot be inferred from this that those districts are parti- cularly liable to disease. They are the cattle-owning districts par excellence, and it is probable that reporting there is less defective than anywhere else. The opposite end of the scale is perhaps the West Coast, where the cattle are essentially migratory and proprietary care and interest are at a minimum. 6.

The subjects taught under the new curriculum for the third year class were6 The Committee met at Bezwada and Madras on the 27th and 29th June 1932, respectively, and selected 44 students in all for admission, leaving 12 candidates in the waiting list. The total strength of the first year class at the end of the session was 45 including the failed students of the previous year who rejoined the class. Of these 45 students, 41 were paying students, while 4 were non-paying students admitted to the College prior to the introduction of tuition fees. As regards the educational qualifications of these students, 14 were Intermediates and above, while the remaining 31 were Secondary School-Leaving Certificate holders declared eligible for the college course. In the second and third year classes, there were 42 and 31 students, respectively, at the end of the year. Thus the total number of students on the rolls in all the three classes at the end of the session was 118, as against 125 of the previous year. The different communities to which these 118 students belonged are shown below : 7 time for the students of the final year class who failed at the annual examination held in March 1932 under the old curriculum. Both the supplementary and special examinations were conducted by the Director of Veterinary Services and the Principal, Madras Veterinary College. Six students of the first year class appeared for the examination and five passed, seven students of the second year class appeared and all the seven passed and nine students of the third year class appeared and five passed. The annual professional examinations of the College were held during the year, as usual, in March 1933 and were conducted by an Examining Board specially constituted for the purpose. The President and Members of the Board were8 there were two messes, vegeterian and non-vegeterian, which was managed by the representatives of the students themselves under the guidance of the Superintendent of the hostel. The health of the students was uniformly good during the year and their conduct satisfactory. The athletic activities of the students were also good. (ii) Hospital. 13. Mr. K. S. Nayar, Lecturer in Surgery, was in charge of the Veterinary hospital attached to the Madras Veterinary College during the year and the hospital continued to show satisfactory progress. There was an appreciable increase in the total number of admissions to the hospital during the year as compared with the previous year, the figures for the two years 1932-33 and 1931-32 being 5,410 and 4,680 respectively. The daily average attendance at the hospital also increased from 70.6 in the previous year to 75.89 during the year under report, and there was also an increase in the hospital receipts from Rs. 4,303-15-0 in the previous year to Rs. 4,660 in the year under report. The branch veterinary dispensary for out-patients at Raya- puram continued to be under the control of the Principal, Madras Veterinary College, and it also showed satisfactory progress during the year. The total number of cases treated at the institution increased from 2,958 in the previous year to 3,838 during the year under report. The daily average attendance at the dispensary also increased from 31.6 in the previous year to 37.37 during the year. Twenty-seven cases of special interest were transferred from this institution to the Madras Veterinary College for treat- ment during the year. (iii) Shoeing Forge. 14. The shoeing forge attached to the Madras Veterinary College continued to be utilized to give the students practical instruction in shoeing. Eight hundred and eighty-three horses were shod and 46 shoes were repaired during the year as against 870 and 118 respectively, in the previous year. There was a net profit of Rs. 392-9-3 in the working of the forge during the year, as against Rs. 441-9-9 in the previous year. (iv) Laboratory. 15. Messrs. V. Krishnamurti Ayyar, Professor of Pathology and Bacteriology and M. Anant Narayan Rao, Lecturer in Para- sitology, continued to be in charge of the Pathological and Para- sitological sections respectively, of the laboratory attached to the Madras Veterinary College, during the year. The number of specimens received and examined in both the Pathological and
9 Parasitological sections during the year was 4,022 as detailed below :10 22. Post-mortems. 11 (4) Margaropus annulatus. (5) Hyalomma ægyptium. (6) Ornithodorus savignyi. (7) Larvae of oestrus ovis. (8) Stomoxys calcitrans. (9) Tabanus sp. (10) Ctenocephalus canis. One bottle containing parasites from the pharynx of a dog was received from Ootacamund and it was found to be a Pentas- toma sp, This is the first record of its kind in this Presidency. Infection of Cysticercus cellulosæ was detected in a few of the pigs slaughtered at the Madras slaughter-house and they have been reported to have come from the North Arcot district. With a view to find out if a dog could be an occasional host for Tænia solium, one was fed with pork containing a very large number of live cysts with negative results. 27.

Fifteen goats were used as virus producers in the field. Only two of them died15 Since the close of the year 1932-33, Government issued orders appointing the Veterinary Investigation Officer and the officer is now undergoing preliminary training at the Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research, Muktesar. (e) Research Work at the Madras Veterinary College Laboratory. 40. The following items of research work were in progress in the Pathological and Parasitological sections of the laboratory attached to the Madras Veterinary College :16 Of the different species of poultry experimented with, fowls were found to be most susceptible and ducks least. Pigeons, however, appear to show comparatively greater resistance to infection by contact as has been observed in natural outbreaks. 'A start was made in the preparation of a vaccine from the brain of infected birds for prophylactic use. The vaccine so prepared was tested on fowls and pigeon's. The results indicated that there had been undoubtedly some effect as there was a definite pro- longation of the incubation period in the vaccinated birds, and some of the birds even withstood a very severe test of the virulent virus. Certain modifications in the preparation of the vaccine, perhaps, may improve its quality and experiments in this direction are in progress. (iii) Preparation of anti-pituitary hormone. 43. With a view to adopting the Zondek and Aschheim test urine hormone from pregnant cows was prepared and sent out to be tested in the field. (iv) Nasal Schistosomiasis. 44. Having found that ova of schistosomes could be detected in the nasal washings collected from cattle suspected to be suffering from nasal granuloma and with a view to finding out the extent, incidence and study of infection in cattle, materials were not only obtained from the staff of the Civil Veterinary Department but also collected by the Lecturer in Parasitology personally. The number of specimens received from the staff in the shape of nasal washings was 271 and the number of cases from which the Lecturer had collected exceeded 120. The disease has also been found by him to occur in buffal17 the pathogenicity or otherwise of the trypanosomes found in cattle on the equine species. The experiment was started in the latter part of the year. Two strains of trypanosomes were obtained, one from a bovine and the other from a canine. A pony injected with the bovine strain died after 35 days. Further experiments are in progress. (vi) Helminthic Infection. 46. Apart from the study of nasal schistosomiasis, an insight into the incidence and extent of infection of schistosomes in the different species of animals was obtained by the examination of cattle, sheep and pigs, slaughtered at the slaughter-houses at Madras. The schistosomes found in cattle and sheep were mostly of the schistosoma spindalis type (Montgomery, 191G). None of these cases are reported to have shown nasal lesions. From only one sheep out of 170 sheep and goats examined, a large number of schistosoma spindalis was recovered from the portal vein. Eighty-one pigs were examined at the pig slaughter-house in Madras and from five of them five pairs of new species of schis- tosomes were recovered. V.18 materially increase again for two or three years. This expectation appears to have been realized in that the incidence of this disease throughout the Presidency during the year has been considerably less than in the previous years. There were no virulent outbreaks or heavy mortality in any of the districts as compared with the previous years and, in fact, judging from the absence of reports of outbreaks and from the remarkable fall in mortality figures, most of the districts, particularly Salem, the Nilgiris, Coimbatore, Malabar, Trichinopoly, Tanjore and Vizagapatam were com- paratively free from the disease during the year. The total number of deaths from this disease reported during the year was 12,735 as against 28,412 in 1931-32. The only districts whore the mortality can be said to have been heavy, are Kurnool and Nellore, the figures for the two districts being 3,806 and 2,473 respectively. The number of outbreaks in which inoculations were under- taken during the year was considerably less than in the previous year, the figures for the two years 1932-33 and 1931-32 being 492 and 902. The total number of inoculations performed during the year against Rinderpest by the serum simultaneous method and serum alone method was 101,115 and 151 respectively as against 113,566 and 759 of the previous year. The necessary serum being readily available as the result of the establishment of a Serum Institute in this Presidency, arrangements were made during the year to carry out inoculations against Rinderpest on a large scale even in the absence of outbreaks, to protect cattle against a possible recrudescence of the disease, and a number of inoculations were performed in this way, and the total number of serum simultaneous inoculations for the year given above, includes those performed in the absence of outbreaks. 50. Anthrax.19 during the year, the figures for the two years being 46,179 in 1932-33 and 18,112 in 1931-32. Of the 46,179 inoculations, 37,177 were performed by the serum and aggressin method and 9,052 by the serum alone method. 53. Foot-and-mouth disease.20 64.

S.P.C.A.23 In addition to the twelve sets each consisting of 200 magic lantern slides on Rinderpest, Anthrax, Blackquarter, Foot and Month disease, etc., supplied to the District Veterinary Officers in the previous year for propaganda purposes, three more sets of slides, one in English, another in Tamil and a third in Telugu, each consisting of 136 slides on diseases of animals communicable to man, viz., Tænia solium, Tænia saginata, Echinococcus granulosum, Dipylidium caninum, Trichinella spiralis, Rabies, Tuberculosis of bovine origin, Sarcoptes scabeii, etc., were prepared at the Madras Veterinary College and supplied to the District Veterinary Officers during the year. Of these, the English set was supplied to the District Veterinary Officer, Madras, for use throughout the Presidency whenever required, the Tamil set to the District Veterinary Officr, Trichinopoly, for use in all the Tamil districts and the Telugu set to the District Veterinary Officer, Bezwada, for use in the Telugu areas. 76. Fairs and shows.24 expenditure was, apart from the economy observed wherever possible, mainly due to the manufacture of rinderpest serum locally at the serum institute opened during the year instead of obtaining the serum from Muktesar as was done in previous years. There was a decrease under each sub-head except under ' Direction. ' The increase under ' Direction ' is due to the debit of expenditure of the serum institute under this head. The receipts of the department amounted to Rs. 45,292-5-1 as against Rs. 36,384-11-0 of the previous year. The increase is due to the receipts amounting to about Rs. 5,000 realized at the serum institute and about Rs. 4,000 on account of fees for the export of sheep and goats at Tuticorin. XI.25 question of increasing the output of the Institute with a view to meet possible demands for serum from outside the Presidency, e.g., native states and other provinces, is engaging consideration. 85.

Progress continued on several lines of research in the laboratory attached to the college. The special officer appointed to investigate the control of rinderpest has finished his work and has submitted his report. Experiments in the use of goat-virus to protect cattle against rinderpest were in progress during the year. 6. The inauguration of the Serum Institute was an important event of the year. The manufacture of anti-rinderpest serum started in June, and local serum was supplied from August 1932. The results of inoculation with the local serum in the districts were satisfactory and considerable savings were effected in expenditure. 7. During the year the recorded deaths from all contagious diseases were a little over 40,000, as against 99,900 in 1930-31 and 56,600 in 1931-32 ; the lowest figure for many years past. The mortality from rinderpest has declined very substantially from 59,300 in 1930-31 to 28,400 in 1931-32 and 12,700 in 1932-33. Kurnool and Nellore have again been the worst sufferers and special attention to the conditions of these two districts seems to be required. 8. The work of the touring staff, and at the hospitals and dispensaries was very satisfactory. Cases treated in hospitals have increased by nearly 30 per cent during the last two years. The efficacy and popularity of the Burdizzo method of castration is attested by the increase in the number of those operations performed. 9. Advantage continues to be taken of health and baby weeks, cattle fairs and exhibitions to demonstrate and dissemi- nate knowledge of the work of the department. The increasing demand for its services is a measure of the efficacy of this propaganda. (By order of the Government, Ministry of Public Works) C. A. HENDEESON, Secretary to Government.
