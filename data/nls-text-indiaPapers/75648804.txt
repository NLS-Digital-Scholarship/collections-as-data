Table II.5 (vi) LABORATORY AND INVESTIGATION WORK 45. 788 (seven hundred and eighty-eight specimens of blood smears, scrapings, fæces and morbid material, etc., from cases of Surra, Piroplasmosis, Anthrax, Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia, Mange, Coccidiosis, Strangles, etc., were received from the subordinate staff and examined. 460 of these were found positive.

There were eight Veterinary Field Compounders working in the department. Of theses six were placed in charge of Itinerating Veterinary Dispensaries and 2 were working under the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons. They attended, as usual, minor ailments of animals such as Liver Fluke, Parasitic gastritis, Foot-and-Mouth disease, Mange, etc. They also carried out castra- tions of bulls by Burdizzo method. This cadre has been found to be very cheap and useful agency to supplement the Veterinary work in the district and it has been keenly felt that the cadre should be expanded and in this connection the proposals have been submitted to Government which are awaiting their decision. 55. The clerical establishment worked very satisfactorily and ungrudgingly during the year in spite of a great pressure of work. Mr. P. J. Mankodi, head clerk, retired after rendering 31 years service and Mr. J. L. Anjaria the second clerk was appointed in his place from 13th February 1943. Proposals to increase the number and prospects of this cadre have been submitted to Government for sanction. V.TABLE I.
