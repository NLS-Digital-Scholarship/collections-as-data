Remarks by Lieutenant-Colonel J. Manners Smith, V.C., C.V.O., C.I.E., Hon'ble the Agent to the Governor-General, Rajputana, and Chief Commissioner, Ajmer-Merwara. The year under report has been marked by an abnormally high mortality owing to the outbreak of plague and a virulent type of fever. These outbreaks were directly connected with the phenomenally heavy rainfall. With the advent of the hot weather plague has died down and it is hoped that the epi- demic will not revive in the present year to anything approaching the same extent. One satisfactory feature is the increasing popularity of inoculation, to which the public are now largely resorting both in Ajmer-Merwara and in many of the States. The epidemics have thrown much extra work on Colonel MacWatt and the other medical officers in Rajputana whose services I desire to acknowledge. The introduction of sanitary reforms in Ajmer continues to engage the attention of the authorities. The Municipal Regulation is being remodelled with a view to increasing the effective control of the Committee in sanitary matters. The chief obstacles in the path of progress, however, are difficulties of a financial nature: these difficulties can hardly be expected to diminish during the war.

VITAL STATISTICS AND SANITATION IN RAJPUTANA. 3 10. The above table shows the total number of cholera cases and deaths reported in Rajputana during the year 1917. Ajmer-Merwara. 11. According to this, with the exception of 11 cases and 9 deaths reported in Ajmer City in June, July and August, Ajmer-Merwara District was free from the disease. Native States. 12. 89 cases with 60 deaths were reported from the Native States of Rajputana against 6,770 cases and 4,177 deaths in 1916. 13. In Jaipur 37 seizures with 36 deaths were reported from 22nd March to 13th October, 1917. Of these, 36 cases and 35 deaths occurred in Jaipur City including 1 case in the Central Jail and 1 fatal case in Sambhar town, as compared with 921 attacks and 847 deaths in the previous year. 14. In Bharatpur 41 seizures with 19 deaths were reported in 3 towns in September and October, 1917. Bharatpur City was free from the disease. 15. In Karauli 11 cases with 5 deaths were reported in September, 1917 in 1 village. 16. The usual precautionary and preventive measures were adopted. 17. As the Cholera outbreak in Rajputana was slight no map has been attached to the report. SANITATION. Ajmer City Conservancy. 18. The sanitary condition of Ajmer City and suburbs is still far from perfect. Endeavours are being made by the Municipality to increase the number of foul water and rubbish carts which are scarcely sufficient to meet the wants of an increasing population : and more public latrines and urinals which are required will be provided when circumstances permit. The difficulty in obtain- ing iron, the high prices ruling on account of the war, and the financial state of the Municipality suffice to retard progress in this respect. 19. Galvanised Iron movable receptacles for the collection of solid and liquid matter have been provided in almost all private latrines. 20. Many old private latrines which were insanitary have been improved by opening ventilators and carrying out structural alterations. 21. The covered drains in the city and suburbs are insanitary and in great need of improvement. The matter is under the consideration of the con- servancy Sub-Committee- 22. The slaughter house, meat and beef markets and the butchers' shops still leave much to be desired: and required improvements when funds permit. 23. The nightsoil from private houses is collected by birat sweepers who carry it in receptacles to the tramway collecting station: their work is un- satisfactory. 24. The nightsoil and rubbish as also the foul water of Ajmer is conveyed by steam tramway from the collecting station to the trenching ground, about 3½ miles distant. 25. The Municipality cannot afford to pay a qualified Assistant Health Officer. The Civil Surgeon of Ajmer, who is much overworked, along with the conservancy Sub-Committee spends several hours a week in settling questions of insanitation and visiting sites which are reported as unhygienic: but the authority of the Sub-Committee would appear to be very limited; and, in many cases, resolutions passed by them cannot be carried into effect with the expedition necessary in sanitary matters, on account of want of summary powers, or by reason of technical or legal difficulties. The result is that there is undue delay in remedying some of the most flagrant cases of insanitation. Municipal rules are under revision and it is hoped this defect will soon be removed. B
4 VITAL STATISTICS AND SANITATION IN RAJPUTANA. 26. The shortage of sweepers is a cause of grave anxiety and hindrance to the work. Their ranks have been further depleted by the epidemics of plague and malaria which have visited Ajmer during 1917. 27. Several absorption pits have been constructed as an experimental measure for dealing with surplus water from hydrants and other sources : the results, so far, are encouraging. 28. A large part of the expenditure on sanitation is incurred in carting sullage water gratuitously from the houses of citizens up hill to the tramway terminus. Surface drainage of the city and suburbs is urgently required and a conservancy tax should be introduced, to be paid by all householders, to enable the Conservancy Sub-Committee to deal efficiently with sanitary matters. 29. I would strongly urge that an officer of the Indian Medical Service be appointed to Ajmer, who would be of much assistance to the Civil Surgeon and enable that officer to attend to the medical and sanitary wants of the Ajmer- Merwara District: and not the least important of his duties would be attention to the practical sanitation of Ajmer for which he should receive a Municipal allowance at least equivalent to the salary formerly paid to so-called Assistant Health Officers who have generally been super-annuated Sub-Assistant Surgeons of little use in Public Health Matters. Water supply. 30. On account of heavy and continuous rain the Foy Sagar, Ana Sagar, Bhaonta and Budha Pushkar which are the main sources of water supply to the City and Railway workshops filled to overflowing. 31. The wells, Baoris, and Jhalras in the city and suburbs are also well filled. 32. Beawar. VITAL STATISTICS IN NATIVE STATES. 5 (4) A compound wall was added to the Slaughter House in Sripura. (5) Owing to continuous heavy rainfall 24 houses in the City fell in. They were demolished and reconstructed. (6) All wells and Baoris filled with water. 42. Kotah City shows evidence of continuous sanitary improvements. VACCINATION. STATEMENT I. 43. The total number of persons vaccinated in Ajmer-Merwara including Nasirabad fell from 19,429 in 1916-1917 to 13,694 in 1917-1918. There was also a decline in the average number of successful primary operations, the average number of persons vaccinated by each Vaccinator, and in the average number of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population, which were 16,112, 1,295, and 35.14 respectively in the preceding year. The total number of re-vaccinations in 1917-1918 was 437 against 2,011 in 1916-1917 and that of successful re-vaccinations 362, as compared with 1,507 in the previous year. The decrease under all heads was due chiefly to the severe epidemics of Plague and Malaria in this Division. 44. The number of vaccinators was 15, the same as in the previous year : and one Native Superintendent. 45. The Civil Surgeon, Ajmer inspected 98 vaccinated children against 1,257 in 1916-1917, all of whom were found successful. The Superintendent of Vaccination at Nasirabad examined 680 children, all of whom were found successful. 46. The Native Superintendent inspected 453 villages against 205 in 1916&quot; 1917 ; and examined 5,025 vaccination operations, as compared with 3,920 in the previous year. 47. Vaccination in Ajmer-Merwara is not satisfactory ; many infants remain unvaccinated, the parents concealing or refusing to produce them. General operations in Native States. 48. The Vaccination Returns from the Native States show a falling-off under all heads due to the severe epidemic of Plague and Malaria throughout Raj- putana during the season. The total number of primary vaccinations in Native States was 190,290 of which 184,179 were successful, against 244,080 primary and 239,196 successful operations in the preceding year. Re-vaccination also fell from 4,249 in 1916-1917 to 228 in the year under report. 49. There were 163 vaccinators, the same as in the previous year, 1 less in Jaisalmer and Bharatpur, respectively, and one additional vaccinator in Bikaner and Karauli. As vaccinations were performed entirely by the Sub- Assistant Surgeon attached to the Agency Hospital, Deoli, no vaccinator was employed in Deoli Cantonment during the season. 50. Western Rajputana States.6 VACCINATION AND DISPENSARIES IN RAJPUTANA. 53. The cost of each successful vaccination in this division was 49 pies against 34 pies in 1916-1917. Expenditure on vaccination in Native States. 54. The total expenditure on vaccination in Native States was R34,919- 15-1 as compared with R33,312-15-9 in 1916-1917 : the increase is due to the fact that glycerinated lymph was obtained on payment from the Government Bovine Lymph Depôts. The cost of each successful vaccination in different States varied from 18 pies in Kotah to 166 pies in Jaisalmer. 55. The following table shows the number of towns and villages inspected and Vaccination seen by Residency or Agency Surgeons in Native States:DISPENSARIES IN RAJPUTANA. 7 the Durbar he will proceed to the detailed plans.

Scurvy. 75. 555 cases of scurvy were treated against 820 in 1916 and 966 in 1915. Leprosy. 76. 379 Lepers received treatment as compared with 430 in 1916, and 566 in 1915. The Jaipur Residency Surgeon reports that 32 Lepers were treated with Leproline. Some were treated with Sodium gynocardate according to Sir Leonard Rogers' method; patients treated thus derived the same benefit as the others from Leproline. Plague. 77. The year from 1st April, 1917 to 31st March, 1918, was marked by a very severe outbreak of plague throughout the Province ; and the disease still prevails. 78. 116,168 Plague seizures and 98,192 deaths were reported in 2,101 towns and villages infected in Ajmer-Merwara District and in the Native States of Rajputana against 1,633 cases with 1,285 deaths in 59 towns and villages in 1916-1917. 79. The percentage of total plague deaths to population was 2.26 as shown in Table attached, as compared with 1.39 in the previous year. 80. 90,948 Anti-plague Inoculations were done during the year under report at the following places :PLAGUE IN RAJPUTANA. 9 (2) Rat traps were issued to the citizens as asked for. (3) Two sects amongst the citizens the &quot; Sewa Samati &quot; and &quot; Sewa Sang- Gaushala &quot; made their own arrangements for tending and treat- ing Plague patients and for disposing of dead bodies. The Mussalman community arranged for the decent interment of poor Mohamedans who died from plague. (4) Extra establishment of Inspectors, peons and Inspecting Gangs have been entertained by the Municipality for disinfection. (5) Anti-plague inoculation was performed in the Victoria Hospital at Ajmer. At first a goodly number of citizens presented them- selves for inoculation. and persons from surrounding villages, Chiefships and Estates came in freely. (6) The occupants of the Ajmer Civil Lines received notices to prevent immigrants from the city and elsewhere from entering their compounds. All compounds, houses and cottages in the Civil Lines are inspected daily by an Inspector. (7) Disinfection was carried out as necessary. (8) Evacuation has been readily resorted to in infected towns and villages. The villagers themselves now realised the benefit of the measure. Native States. 82. 102,955 cases and 88,522 deaths from plague were reported from Native States against 777 cases and 642 deaths in 1916-1917. 83. The epidemic prevailed in all the Native States except Jaisalmer ; and 1,830 towns and villages including the Deoli, Kherwara and Erinpura Cantonments were infected, as compared with 8 States and 44 towns and villages in the previous year. 84. Jaipur.10 PLAGUE IN RAJPUTANA. 91. The Residency Surgeon, Mewar, reports that all the prisoners in the Central-Jail at Udaipur were inoculated. One woman, a relative of a &quot;Warder who escaped being inoculated, caught plague and died on the 10th March, 1918. One prisoner who was inoculated also contracted the disease on 11th March, but recovered. 92. As far as could be ascertained only 28 inoculated persons contracted the disease, of whom 11 died and 17 recovered. 93. Alwar.PLAGUE IN RAJPUTANA. 11 105. Shahpura.12 PLAGUE IN RAJPUTANA. 118. In the infected towns and villages of the Native States, evacuation, disinfection, inoculation and segregation were carried out, Evacuation was the most popular of the methods employed against the disease. 119. Pamphlets in English, Hindi and Urdu regarding the prevention and spread of plague were freely distributed throughout the towns and villages. 120. In some places measures for rat destruction were adopted but the majority of the people in Native States were against it. 121. A plague map showing the districts where outbreaks occurred, the date of the first and last cases and the death rate per 10,000 of population is attached. Snake Bite. 122. Calmette's Anti-Venene is kept in stock in most of the main dispensaries and used for the treatment of snake poisoning when opportunity offers. No special report has been received on the subject. STATEMENT F. 123. Shows the classes and sexes of both in-door and out-door patients treated in the dispensaries of Ajmer-Merwara and of Native States. This calls for no comment, as it is merely introduced for statistical purposes. STATEMENT G. 124. During the year under report 78,692 operations were performed on 78,313 persons in Ajmer-Merwara and in Native States against 80,084 operations done on 79,783 persons in the previous year. Of these cures amounted to 77,010, the number relieved 796, discharged otherwise 194 and 110 as compared with 78,549, 653,232 and 114 respectively in 1916; while 203 remained under treatment at the end of the year. 125. Of the operations performed, 1,907 were extractions of the lens for Cataract, of which 1,684 or 88.30 per cent. were reported successful; 64 Lithotomies, 224 Litholapaxies, and 202 Amputations against 2,464 lens extractions, 61 Lithotomies, 211 Litholapaxies, and 226 Amputations in 1916. 126. 604 Abdominal operations were done, of which 28 proved fatal, as compared with 548 operations with 34 deaths in the previous year. Of these 464 were Paracentesis of Abdomen with 13 deaths, 13 Abscess of the Liver with no death, and 25 Laparotomies with 4 deaths. 127. 1,348 Operations were performed at the Victoria Hospital, Ajmer with 3 deaths against 1,878 operations with 8 deaths, a decrease of 530 chiefly due to Plague and Malaria which existed in severely epidemic form throughout the District. Of these 68 were Extraction of the lens for Cataract, 4 Lithotomies, 14 Litholapaxies, 3 Amputations, 3 Ovariotomies, 19 Radical cure of Hernia and 4 Laparotomies, as compared with 105 extractions of the lens for Cataract, 9 Lithotomies, 21 Litholapaxies, 6 Amputations, 8 Ovario- tomies, 8 Radical cure of Hernia and 1 Laparotomy in 1916 as shown in the Table below:OPERATIONS IN RAJPUTANA. 13 Operations. 1916. 1917.
