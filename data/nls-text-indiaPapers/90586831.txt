HARINGTON, I. M. S., Offg. Administrative Medical Officer, North- West Frontier Province, To E. B. HOWELL, ESQUIRE, I. C. S., Assistant Secretary to the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner, North-West Frontier Province. Dated Peshawar, the 1st July 1905. SIR, I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner, the Annual Report of the Vaccination Department in the North-West Frontier Province for the year 1904-05. Vaccinations performed by different Establishments. Statement No. I. 2. Statement No. I shows the number of vaccination operations per- formed in the various Districts, Agencies and Cantonments in the Province, giving a grand total of 77,042 and an average per vaccinator of 2750.64 Number of operations performed by entire Estab- lishment. Statement No. I. 3. This total of 77,042 is considerably less than that of either 1902-03 or 1903-04, in which years the figures stand at 90,293 and 99,176, respectively, and this decrease may, to a certain extent, be accounted for by the more general prevalence of small-pox in the previous two years resulting in a large number coming in for protective operations and as regards 1903-04 owing to a severe outbreak of small-pox in Chitral where ten temporary extra Vaccinators were sent and 28,353 operations performed. During the year under report small-pox has not been so evident and its absence results in apathy regarding vaccination amongst villagers, especially those in the Agencies. Decrease in Re-Vaccina- tions. Statement No. I. 4. There has also been a decrease in the number of re-vaccinations. In 1902-03, 7,941 re-vaccinations were performed in 1903-04, 4,914 while in the year under report there were only 2,775 operations. This decrease may again be attributed to a year of com- parative freedom from small-pox. In both the preceding years this (disease) was generally prevalent and a considerable amount of re-vaccination was per- formed among the officials and military sepoys2 Percentage of Successful Vaccinations. 5. The percentage of success in 1904-05 for primary vaccination was 98.96 and for re-vaccination 75.39 among cases the results of which were known (those untraceable being omitted). This as far as primary cases are concerned is slightly better than the two preced- ing years, but as regards re-vaccination is considerably lower, being 81.68 in 1902-03 and 87.02 in 1903-04. I can adduce no reason for the difference. Strength of the Vaccina- tion Establishment. 6. The average number of Vaccinators during the year was 28 with 6 Native Supervisors and 2 Divisional Inspectors. In 1903-04 ten temporary extra hands were entertained for the Chitral Agency while in 1902-03 the average was the same as in the year under report. Increase and decrease in primary Vaccinations. Statement No. I. 7. There has been an increase in the number of primary vaccinations during the year under report as compared with last year in the Hazara, Mardan and Dera Ismail Khan Districts, but there has been a decrease of 2,404 in Peshawar, 295 in Kohat, and 1,298 in Bannu districts. The decrease in Peshawar is partly ex- plained by the prolonged cold weather and the small amount of small-pox causing people not to bring their children to be vaccinated. As regards Peshawar city, its population appears to be increasing very rapidly and it is in very close proximity to a large Cantonment of British and Native troops. As soon therefore as it can be arranged, the advisability of bringing the Vaccination Act into force within its limits should be practically considered. A severe outbreak of small-pox in the city would be a source of danger to the troops and the public, in its present condition of only partial protection by vaccination. The decrease in the Kohat District is small and was probably the result of a transfer of an experienced vaccinator and his being replaced by a new man unacquainted with the country. In Bannu again the decrease is attributed to the extreme cold and heavy rains and to the fact that few transfrontier Wazirs came in. Seven hundred vaccinations were done the previous year among these, but this year there was not sufficient small-pox to act as an incentive and none came in for vaccination. Vaccinations in Political Agencies. 8. In Political Agencies 2,612 vaccinations were performed as com- pared with 30,723 in 1903-04 and 2,907 in 1902-03. As noted before the increase in 1903-04 was due to the Chitral small-pox epidemic and the temporary entertainment of ten extra vaccinators. I hope to see gradually more work done in these agencies, the trans- frontier tribesmen are at present chary of trying new methods. Most of them have their own inoculators, but this passive, and in the latter case probably active, opposition will in time be overcome. An attempt is being made to teach the inoculators proper vaccination methods and it has in some districts met with a measure of success. Vaccina- tion in the Swat Valley is at present at a stand-still, but I am of opinion if epidemic small-pox broke out there they would be induced to try vaccination. In the Kurram a fair number bring their children in for vaccination, 1,209 vaccinations were done during the year while in the Tochi there were 1,403 operations. Vaccinations performed by Cantonment Staff. 9, In Cantoments 1,833 vaccinations were performed against 2,043 in 1903-04 and 3,240 in 1902-03. Energetic vaccinations in previous years when small-pox was prevalent especially in 1902-03 have practically protected most persons except the floating population and children under one year. Work done by the Dis- pensary Staff. Statement No. III. 10.3 The decrease this year as compared with the last year is probably accounted for by reasons previously stated. The small number in 1902-03 was probably owing to perhaps the. recent introduction of the measure into North-West Frontier Province Dispensaries. Cost of Establishment, Statement No. II. 11. Statement No. II shows the cost of the Department. The year under report shows a decrease of expenditrue on the pre- ceding years. The total expenditure in 1904-05 was Rs. 11,222, this was Rs. 3,261 less than in 1903-04 and Rs. 422 less than in 1902-03. Cost per successful case. 12. This extra expenditure in the preceding year was owing to the Chitral outbreak of small-pox previously noted. The cost per successful case was-/2/5 as compared with-/2/6 in 1903-04 and-/2/3 in 1902-03. Primary Vaccinations for last five years. Statement No. IV. 13. Statement No. IV shows the number of primary vaccinations for the last five years and progress though slow appears to be fairly satisfactory. There is no doubt, as the people both in the notified areas and the transfrontier begin to see the per- manent value of vaccination the increase in numbers should be more marked. Inspection by the Officers of the Department. Statement No. V. 14. Statement No. V shows inspection work done by the Civil Surgeons and the Vaccination Staff. My predecessor, Lt -Col. P. A. Weir, I. M. S., was in charge during the whole year. He inspected in the districts 1,518 primary vaccinations and 58 re-vaccinations with only 2.2 per cent of failures. In the Agencies of Kurram, and Tochi he also saw 1,983 vaccinations with no absolute negative result. More inspections were done this year than in the two previous by Civil Surgeons and this I consider a matter of importance, the more time a Civil Surgeon can spare for vaccination inspection work the more will be done and the quality will improve. Appendix A. 15. Appenix A gives the number of children available for vaccina- tion during the year and the number of vaccinations per- formed in towns. Vaccination Act. 16. The Vaccination Act was introduced into Kohat from 1st October 1904, so that now three towns enforce it viz. Kohat, Bannu, and Dera Ismail Khan. That Peshawar should enforce the Act I have previously noted. Also, now that the Abbottabad Cantonment is be- ing extended and that the railway will probably pass through it shortly it would be as well to include it in the list of towns in which this Act should be in force. Appendix B. 17. Appendix B gives the total successful vaccinations for the last 5 years and the annual ratios of deaths per mille from small- pox per district and agency. It will be noted that the ratio of deaths from small-pox has been less during the year under report than in either of the two preceding years. Results of various kinds of lymph used. 18. Animal lymph was used in 63,358 primary and 2,370 re-vaccinations with a percentage of success in the former of 95.4. Vaseline lymph was employed in 7,994 primary and 373 re-vaccinations a percentage of 90.1 successful. Human lymph was used in 2.915 primary and 32 re-vaccinations the percentage of success being 98.2.
4 General remarks. 19. Vaccination as a whole is in its early stages as far as the North- West Frontier Province is concerned, only three towns in the Province enforcing the vaccination Act. With imperfect registration of births especially out of notified areas it is difficult to guage the numbers of unprotected children. More work could be done by vaccinators if they had greater facilities in getting from village to village which are often far apart. Also the grant of horse allowance to all Native Supervisors and Divisional Inspectors would give a greater power of supervision, and better work and more accurate figures would be obtained. Village registers are now as far as this Department is concerned somewhat inaccurately kept and corrections have to be continually reported for registration. As regards the Vaccine Lymph Supply for the North-West Frontier Province we are at present largely dependent on the Punjab. There appears to have been some difficulties in the way of obtaining buffalo calves for maintain- ing sufficient lymph for our requirements. I am however about to formulate some poposals for Central Depots at large towns in districts,Diagram showing the death-rates from Small-pox per 10,000 of population during the year 1904-05 the average rate of mortality from Small-pox per 1,0000 of population for the five years ending 1903-04 and the proportion of successful vaccinations during the years 1904-05, and the preceding six years in each District of the North- West Frontier Province.

DENNYS, I. M. S., Offg. Administrative Medical Officer, North- West Frontier Province, To E. B. HOWELL, ESQUIRE, I. C. S., Assistant Secretary to the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner, North- West Frontier Province. Dated, Nathia Gali, the 4th July 1906. SIR, I have the honour to submit, herewith, for the information of the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner, the Annual Returns on the working of the Vaccination Department of this Province for the year 1905-06, and to offer the following remarks :2 Appendix to Statement No.I. Vaccinations in Political Agencies. 8. In the Political Agencies of Kurram and Tochi and in the Sub- Agency of Chitral there were 3,542 operations per- formed, against 2,612 in the previous year. 9. Of these, 3,321 were Primary and 221 were Re-vaccinations, against 2,519 and 93, respectively, in the previous year. The percentage of successful cases was also higher, both in Primary and in Re-vaccinations than in 1904-05. The best work was done in the Kurram Agency. Vaccinators employed in Political Agencies. 10. One vaccinator has been permanently entertained in each of the Kurram and Tochi Agencies, the vaccinator employed during six months of the year in the Chitral Sub-Agency having been temporarily entertained. As these men require a special know- ledge of the people among whom they work, it is obviously undesirable that they should be interchangeable with District Vaccinators. I have, therefore, arranged to place them on a separate list and class them as &quot; Local Vaccina- tors.&quot; They will not then get their promotion from grade to grade in the ordinary way, but will receive special allowances to compensate them for this. I should like to see other Political Agencies on this Frontier introduce a system of vaccination and propose addressing the Political Agents on the subject. Vaccinations in Canton- ments. 11. In the Cantonment of Peshawar, where the Vaccination Act is in force, there have been very satisfactory increases of both Primary and Re-vaccinations as compared with the previous year, while at Now- shera Cantonment there has been a marked falling off in Primary Vac- cinations. Both these cantonments entertain a vaccinator of their own. The Civil Surgeon, Peshawar, is responsible for vaccine operations in both these Cantonments and he has recently urged on the Nowshera Cantonment authorities the advisability of their introducing the Vaccination Act there, as it has been working successfully in Peshawar for some years. In the Cantonments of Kohat, Bannu, Dera Ismail Khan, Mardan and Abbottabad, vaccine operations are performed by the District Staff, Separate returns have been received from the three first named only, and they show a very satisfactory increase of both Primary and Re-vaccinations as compared with the previous year. No operations were performed at the Mardan and Abbottabad Contonments. Vaccinations in Foreign Territory. 12. The vaccinator entertained for the Sherani Country, succeeded in vaccinating 3,843 persons viz 3,219 Primary and 624 Re-vaccinations. A vaccinator from the Hazára District performed 1,249 operations (all primary) in the Amb Territory. Statement No. II. Cost of the Department. 13. The total cost was Rs. 11,643 against Rs. 11,222 in the preceding year, the rise being due principally to the addition of three vaccinators to the Staff of the Hazára District and to the temporary entertainment of a vaccinator in the Chitral Sub-Agency. The cost of vaccine operations in the Hazara District rose from Rs. 1,688 in 1904-05 to Rs. 2,052 in the year under report. Of the total cost, only Rs. 472 were paid from Imperial Funds against Rs. 1,454 in the previous year, There was a slight increase in the amount paid from Provincial Funds. Local Funds increased their expenditure on vaccine operations by over Rs. 2,000 while Municipal Funds decreased their expenditure by about Rs. 700.
3 Cost per successful case. 14. The cost, per successful case, amounted to 2 annas against 2 annas 5 pies in the previous year, the total number of successful operations having been 92,311 against 72,351 in the preceding year. Statement No. III. Dispensary Vaccinations. 15. Of the 2,845 operations performed by Civil Surgeons, Hospital Assistants and Compounders, 2,270 were done in the Chitral Sub-Agency, 546 at the Khyber Rifles Hospital at Landi Kotal and 29 at Peshawar by the Civil Surgeon. This is a great improvement on the previous year. Statement No. IV. Comparison of work done during the last seven years. 16. It will be seen that the work done in the year under report was better than in any of the preceding years with the excep- tion of 1904, in which year small-pox prevailed in a wide spread epidemic, and the people were in consequence more eager to be vaccinated. Statement No. V. Inspections made by Civil Surgeons, Native Supervisors and Divisional Inspectors. 17. Inspections made were as follows :4 Native Supervisors and Divisional Inspectors are fully qualified to report on the success or otherwise of the operations performed, and I cannot too strongly deprecate excessive zeal in this matter on the part of Civil Sur- geons and the Administrative Medical Officer. This often drives the people to resorting to inoculation, which they know is not followed up by an army of inspecting officers. Appendix A. Children available in towns for vaccination and number of operations per- formed, also dates of exten- sion of Vaccination Act. 18. It will be seen that with the exception of Peshawar and Lakki, all the Municipal towns in the Province have now been brought under the Vaccination Act. The question will again be urged on the Deputy Commissioners of Peshawar and Bannu. The number of successful operations performed on children under one year of age, as compared with the number available for operation, at the two towns where vaccination is not compulsory, has, however, been fairly satisfactory. Appendix B. Successful vaccinations with Annual Ratios of deaths from small-pox, per mille, of population during last 5 years. 19. The deaths from small-pox have been lower than in any of the preceding four years and the large increase in operations is, therefore, most creditable to the Vaccination Staffs and the Civil Surgeons under whom they have worked, Particulars of Vaccina- tions performed by various kinds of lymph. 20. Animal lymph was used in 68,250 Primary and 10,979 Re-vaccina- tions with a percentage of success in the former of 93.49. Vaseline and Glycerine lymph was used in 14,695 Primary and 1,278 Re-vaccinations, the percentage of success in the former being 91.55 and human lymph in 4,826 Primary and 838 Re-Vac- cinations with a percentage of 98.32 of successful cases in the former. Vaseline and glycerinated lymph was more largely used in the Peshawar District than in any other owing to the difficulty of obtaining buffalo calves in this district. Human lymph, it will be observed, was scarcely used at all in the settled districts but was resorted to largely in the Sherani Country and in the Kurram Valley. It will be seen that the vast majority of operations were performed with animal lymph, generally obtained from the buffalo calf, though I understand that cow calves and young donkeys have occasionally been used when buffalo calves were not forthcoming. Each Civil Surgeon and Medical Officer obtains his lymph at the commencement of the season from the Central Vaccine Depôt in the Punjab. With this lymph, buffalo calves are vaccinated and a good supply is secured during the remainder of the winter. In some Districts, where there is much difficulty in maintaining the supply through calves, the Depôt has continued to supply tubes of glycerinated and vaseline lymph at fixed intervals throughout the vaccinating season. No difficulties in obtaining sufficient lymph from the Depôt have been brought to my notice and the operations performed with this lymph have been most successful. Vaccination Lymph Depôt. 21. The suggestion made by my predecessor, Lieut.-Colonel V. Harington in his Annual Vaccination Report for 1904-05 of estab- lishing Central Depôts at large towns in this Province for the supply of lymph has been dropped, in accordance with the proposals contained in a letter No. 2087, dated 4th, December 1905, from the Under Secretary to Government of India, Home Department, to the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner, that it would be more economical and satisfactory to obtain lymph from the Punjab Depôt which is under continuous skilled management.
5 Efforts made to train Mullas in the art of vacci- nation. 22. An effort has been made by the Deputy Commissioner and Civil Surgeon, Kohat, to train certain Mullas in the Hangu town to perform vaccine operations but the experiment has so far proved a failure for a variety of reasons. It is proposed to make renewed efforts next winter. Vaccination inspection by Administrative Medical Officer. 23. My predecessor, Lieut.-Col. A. M. Crofts, C. I. E., during the cold weather of 1905-06, inspected 463 children in the Dera Ismail Khan, Kohat and Kulachi municipal towns, Tank notified area and village of Teri. Of these 329 showed six marks, 77 five marks and 57 one to four marks, the percentage of unsuccessful cases of the total number inspected being 1.94 only. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, G. W. P. DENNYS, LIEUT.-COL., I. M. S., Offg. Administrative Medical Officer, North- West Frontier Province.

READNo. 3479. FROM LIEUT.-COLONEL A. M. CROFTS, C.I.E., I. M. S., Administrative Medical Officer, North- West Frontier Province. To J. L. MAFFEY, ESQUIRE, I. C. S., Assistant Secretary to the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner North- West Frontier Province. Dated Peshawar, the 22nd July 1907. SIR, I have the honour to forward, herewith, for the information of the Chief Commissioner, the prescribed Annual Vaccination Returns for the year 1906-07, and to offer the following remarks :2 Primary vaccinations per- formed by district staff. 5. There was a decrease of about 11,000 in the number of primary operations performed by the district staff. With the exception of the Peshawar District, which shows an increase of 1,084 over last year's figures, all the settled districts of the Province inclusive of the Mardan Sub-Division contributed towards this decrease, the most marked falling off being noticeable in the Dera Ismail Khan, Hazara and Kohat Districts in the order named. The falling off in the Dera Ismail Khan District is ascribed to the following causes :3 Cost of the department. Statement No. II. 9. The total expenditure incurred on account of the vaccination staff of the Province and on contingencies was Rs. 11,216 compared with Rs. 11,643 in the preceding year, the decrease of Rs. 427 being mainly due to the grant of furlough to the Senior Divisional Inspector during whose absence on leave acting allowance only was drawn by the officiating incumbents. It is satisfactory to note that the amount spent on contingencies has been less than the preceding year, the Peshawar, Hazara and Kohat Districts contributing towards the decrease. Cost per successful case. 10. The cost, per successful case, was Re. 0-2-2 as compared with Re. 0-2-0 in 1905-06 and Re. 0-2-5 in 1904-05, the total number of successful operations having been 83,501 against 92,311 in 1905-06 and 72,351 in 1904-05. Dispensary vaccination. Statement No. III. 11. In the Wano and Khyber Agencies vaccine operations were per- formed by Hospital Assistants, the former showing 808 primary vaccinations and 366 re-vaccinations and the latter 65 and 42 under the same heads, respectively. During the year no vaccine operations were performed at dispensaries in the Chitral Agency whereas in the preceding year no less than 2,270 primary operations were performed. Comparison of work done during the past eight years. Statement No. IV. 12. In this statement the work done during the year under report showing the total number of persons primarily vaccinated and the total number of those persons who were success- fully vaccinated during the year is contrasted with the work done for the past seven years. The reason for the small outturn of work during the year has already been explained but it will be seen from the figures for the past five years that satisfactory progress has been made. Inspections made by the officers of the department. Statement No. V. 13. The total number of vaccine operations was 76,604 primary operations and 15,289 re-vaccinations as compared with 87,771 and 13,095. respectively, in the preceding year. Civil Surgeons inspected 4,774 primary and 801 re-vacci- nations or 6.23 and 5.24, respectively, of the work done, the percentage of cases found successful having been 96.19 and 56.43. The inspection work done by Divisional Inspectors and Native Supervisors as compared with the previous year was as follows :4 Particulars of vaccine operations performed by various kinds of lymph. 16. Animal lymph was used in 58,095 primary operations and 10,524 re-vaccinations, with a percentage of success of 93.76 in the former and 80.99 in the latter. Vaseline lymph was employed in 15,720 primary and 4,530 re-vaccinations, the percentage of success in the former being 92.61 and 65.85 in the latter. Human (arm-to-arm) lymph was used in 2,789 primary and 235 re-vaccinations and the percentage of success in the former was 98.28 and in the latter 95.32. Animal lymph was largely employed in the settled districts of the Province, where there are facilities of obtaining buffalo calves. Until very recently difficulty was experienced in the Peshawar District in obtaining buffalo calves, but owing to the exertions of Native Supervisor Sheikh Fazal Mahmud, who is very well reported on by the Civil Surgeon, Peshawar, this difficulty has to a great extent been overcome and the cost on account of contingencies has been reduced. As noticed in last year's report the Central Vaccine Depôt in the Punjab continues to supply the Province with vaseline and glycerinated lymph when required and no complaint has been made in regard to its quality. Human lymph as usual was largely resorted to in the Shirani Country, the arm-to-arm method being also employed, to a small extent, in the Hazara and Bannu Districts and in the Kurram Valley. Efforts made to train Mullahs in the art of vacci- nation. 17. It is satisfactory to note that the Deputy Commissioner, Kohat, having interested himself in the matter, three Mullahs of Hangu, who practice inoculation, have been induced by Naib Tahsildar Talib Mohayuddin to learn how to vacci- nate. The necessary lancets and lymph will be supplied to them next October and it is hoped that, with gentle persuasion and encourage- ment in the shape of small monetary rewards, they may in time give up inocu- lation in favour of vaccination. Recruitment of vaccina- tors. 18. In accordance with the orders contained in Government of India Resolution No. 190-202, dated the 27th November last, vaccinators employed after that date have been placed on the same footing as other local fund employees. As the scheme has only recently been introduced, it is difficult to tell how the change in the system of recruiting vaccinators will work in practice in this Province where in the past it was found difficult to enroll vaccinators. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, A. M. CROFTS, LIEUT.-COLONEL, I. M. S., Administrative Medical Officer, North- West Frontier Province.

Administrative Medical Officer, North- West Frontier Province, To J. L. MAFFEY, ESQUIRE, I. C. S., Assistant Secretary to the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner, North- West Frontier Province. Dated Peshawar, the 15th July 1908. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit herewith, for the information of the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner, the Annual Vaccination Report for the year 1907-08, and to offer the following remarks on the working of the department :2 Average number of operations by each vaccinator. 4. The average number of operations performed by each vaccinator in the Province was 2,753.18 against 2,964.29 in the previous year and 3,253.74 in 1905-1906. The largest amount of work done by each vaccinator took place in the Bannu and Dera Ismail Khan Districts, the averages being 3,664.33 and 3,287.00, respectively. The largest decrease in average work done by each vaccinator, viz. 995.83 was in the Hazara District. This may partly be accounted for by the explanation furnished above and partly by the fact that the two newly entertained vaccinators in the Municipalities of Abbottabad and Haripur only worked for half the year. It must be remem- bered that vaccination in the Hazara District is attended with a good deal of difficulty owing to the hilly nature of the country and the long distances that the vaccinators have to travel, but considering the fact that vaccinators are able to work in the district all the year round instead of only for six months, as in the plains, it is hoped that the average work done by each vaccinator will be larger in future years. Primary and re-vaccination. 5. Of the total number of operations performed, 76,349 were primary against 76,604 and 87,771 in the two preceding years and 14,506 were secondary against 15,289 and 13,095 in the two preceding years. The work of the Province as a whole shows a large decrease during the last two years, but there has been an improve- ment in its quality in the settled districts of the Province. Percentage of success. 6. The percentage of successful cases in which the results were known was primary 99.22, and secondary 88.18. These results are much better than in the two preced- ing years and are, I think, attributable to the excellent quality of the glyceri- nated chloroform lymph supplied by the Punjab Vaccine Depôt in much larger quantities than in previous years. Ratio of persons successfully accinated per 1,000 of population. 7. The ratio of persons successfully vaccinated per thousand of the population was 41.98, as compared with 39.67 and 44.11, respectively, in 1905-06 and 1906-07. With the exception of the Peshawar District and Mardan Sub-division, the proportion of those vaccinated is above the provincial ratio. The attention of the Civil Surgeons concerned will be drawn to this matter with a view of more strenuous efforts being made to increase the work during the ensuing vaccination season. Percentage of unknown cases to total cases. 8. It is satisfactory to note that the percentage of unknown cases to the total number of cases in regard to primary vaccina- tions was much less than in the preceding two years, and this shows that greater care has been taken to ascertain the results of the operations performed. Average annual number of deaths from small-pox during previous five years. 9. The average annual number of deaths from small-pox during the pre- vious five years in the settled districts of the Pro- vince was 1,389 or a ratio of 0.72, per thousand, the Peshawar and Hazara Districts recording the largest average number of deaths from the disease. In my Annual Sanitary Report for 1907, the high death-rate from small-pox recorded at the town of Buffa has been commented on. I would suggest that special arrangements should be made to have vaccination work carried on in this town by the general staff of vaccinators attached to the district, until such time as the Municipality can afford to pay for the services of a whole time vaccinator. Vaccination in Political Agencies. Appendix to Statement No. I. 10. Vaccination work in the Agencies of Kurram and the Tochi and in the Shirani Country during the triennial period on the whole has been satisfactory though there has been a slight falling off in the number of persons vaccinated in the Kurram Agency and in the Shirani Country as compared with the figures of the previous year. No vaccination work was done in the
3 Chitral Sub-Agency and this is due to the fact that sanction to the entertain- ment of two temporary vaccinators for a period of five months for employment in the sub-agency was not communicated till the approach of winter. In the Swat Valley 70 operations were performed but the figures have not been shown in the Appendix to Statement No. I, owing to the annual returns having been printed prior to the receipt of the prescribed returns from the Civil Surgeon, Chakdara. The following is an interesting extract taken from the Annual Report on the Chakdara Civil Dispensary for the year 1907, to show the attempt that was made by the Civil Surgeon to educate the natives of the valley in the method of vaccination:4 Dispensary Vaccination, State- ment No. III. 14. At the Mardan Dispensary 170 operations were performed. In. the previous year 1,174 and 107 vaccination opera- tions were performed by Hospital Assistants in the Wano and Khyber Agencies, respectively, the operations in the former agency having been performed on sepoys, recruits, etc., of the Southern Waziristan Militia as the result of a few cases of small-pox occurring in that agency. It has been ascertained that not a single operation was performed in these agencies on any of the inhabitants of the villages, who seem to prefer their own methods of inoculation. Comparison of work done during the past eight years. Statement No. IV. 15. In this statement is shown the number of persons primarily vaccinated and the number of those persons who were successfully vaccinated in each of the years from 1900 to 1908. It will be seen from the figures exhibited that the results continue to be satisfactory. Inspections made by the officers of the department. 16. The total number of vaccine operations was 90,855 against 91,893 in the preceding year and 100,866 in 1905-06. Civil Surgeons inspected 5,026 operations, of which 97.48 primary and 90.09 secondary were found successful. With reference to the remarks made by me in paragraph 17 of the Annual Vaccination Report for 1905-06, it will be noted there has been a further falling off in inspections by Civil Surgeons. The inspection work done by Divisional Inspectors and Superintendents of Vaccination as compared with the two previous years was as follows :5 Glycerinated chloroform lymph supplied by the Punjab Vaccine Depôt was used in 50,889 primary operations and 9,932 re-vaccinations with a per- centage of success in the former of 95.58 and of 78.85 in the latter. This kind of lymph has given better results than those obtained in either of the two previous years. The percentages in both cases have been worked out on the total number of operations performed including the cases in which the results were not known, and though the figures show about the same results in both cases there is no question that the use of glycerinated lymph in place of animal lymph has many advantages. The lymph received from the Vaccine Depôt permitted of animal and human lymph being much more sparingly used. There can be no doubt that the less we have to bother the people for the supply of buffalo calves or children as vaccinifers, the more popular will vaccination become among them. The efforts made during the last vaccina- tion season to reduce the use of animal and human lymph to a minimum was much appreciated and greatly lessened the friction that was constantly arising owing to the difficulty in obtaining vaccinifers. The use of human lymph has practically ceased in the settled districts of the Province. But not so in the Shirani Country and the Agencies of Wano, Dir, Swat and Chitral, where apparently little difficulty is experienced in obtaining human vaccinifers. When practicable, efforts will be made to resort more freely to the use of animal or glycerinated lymph. Efforts made to train Mullahs in the art of vaccination. 20. The efforts made by the Deputy Commissioner and Civil Surgeon, Kohat, within the past two years to train certain Mullahs of Hangu in the methods of vaccination has unfortunately proved a failure. The Deputy Commissioner, Kohat, makes the following report on the subject :Diagram showing the death-rates from small-pox per 10,000 of population during the year 1907-08, the average rate of mortality from small-pox per 10,000 of population for the five years ending 1906-07, and the proportion of successful vaccinations during the years 1907-08 and the preceding six years in each district of the North- West Frontier Province.

Annual Report on the working of the Vaccination Department in the North-West Frontier Province for the year 1908-09. REVIEW BY THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER. THE vaccination operations in the province during the year under report appear to have been generally satisfactory and to exhibit little change on those of the year before. The Chief Commissioner regards the start that has been made in Chitral as an important step in advance, and is pleased to note the progress recorded in the Shirani country. The question of introducing the Vaccination Act at Peshawar will engage the attention of the Local Administration, but it is a matter that requires very careful treatment, and the Chief Commissioner is not disposed to favour any measure of this kind unless and until there is clear evidence that it will meet with the support of the people themselves. The Chief Commissioner considers it most desirable that the services of professional inoculators who possess the confidence of the people should be obtained as Vaccinators. R. GARRATT, CAPTAIN, Assistant Secretary to the Hon'ble the Agent to the Governor-General and Chief Commissioner, North-West Frontier Province.

S., Administrative Medical Officer, North-West Frontier Province, To CAPTAIN R. GARRATT, I. A., Assistant Secretary to the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner, North- West Frontier Province. Dated Peshawar, the 22nd May 1909. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit, for the information of the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner, the prescribed Vaccination Statements for the year 1908-09, with the following brief remarks :2 Primary vaccinations performed by the district staff. 6. There was an increase of 2,063 in the number of primary vacci- nations performed by the district staff. The increase was contributed by all the districts with the excep- tion of the Kohat district and the Mardan sub-division, notwithstanding the fact that work was considerably hampered by the prevalence of cholera in various parts of the settled districts during the first few months of the vacci- nation season necessitating the employment of several vaccinators on cholera duty. In the Kohat district the decrease was due chiefly to the prevalence of malarial fevers during the last quarter of 1908 and to parents objecting to have their children vaccinated when they were in weakly condition while in the Mardan sub-division, where the mortality from complicating lung complaints was high, it was chiefly due to the prevalence of whooping cough and measles during the winter months. Re-vaccinations performed by the district staff. 7. As regards re-vaccinations, however, there was a considerable falling off, the total number of such operations being only 6,583 as compared with 12,573 in the preceding year. Vaccinations in Political Agen- cies. Appendix to statement No. I. 8. In the agencies of Kurram and the Tochi, there was a marked fall- ing off in the number of operations performed. In the former, it was due to political unrest on the Kurram border and to the suspicions of the trans- border tribes on measures taken by Government to prevent the spread of cholera in the agency. From the fact that certain villages across the Kurram border not long ago solicited the aid of the Government vaccinators on the occurrence of an epidemic of small-pox, it would appear that the people soon discovered that their suspicions were ill-founded. In the Tochi, the decrease was due to strained relations during the cholera epidemics in consequence of a change of vaccinators, the new vaccinator not having been long enough in the valley to get the same confidence of the people that was reposed in his predecessor, who had been five years in the valley and was well-known. It is satisfactory to record that for the first time in the history of the Chitral sub- agency the benefits of vaccination were urged on the Chitralis by Lieute- nant C. H. Cross, Civil Surgeon, Chitral. These people previously practised inoculation though not to any large extent. They now realize the superiority of the new method and this happy result was obtained by the Civil Surgeon training two Chitralis who were obtained through the Mehtar of Chitral as vaccinators. These men, with the assistance of the Hospital Assistants station- ed in that sub-agency performed 3,276 operations of which 2,949 were primary. In the Shirani country also a satisfactory advance has been made, 4,972 oper- ations having been performed against 2,605 in the previous year. Of the former, no less than 3,106 were with glycerinated lymph, which indicates that the arm to arm method in that country is not now in much demand. It is un- fortunate that the work done in the Shirani country cannot be verified by any of the inspecting officers as it is not considered expedient for any officers to go into that country to inspect vaccination work. Beyond 72 operations per- formed in the Chakdara Dispensary, no vaccination work was done in the Swat valley. Last year an attempt was made by Captain G. G. Hirst to get local recruits as vaccinators but owing to petty jealousy it failed. Another attempt to raise local recruits for vaccination will be made during the ensuing winter as by then the former jealousies and objections will have been forgotten. Vaccination in cantonments. Appendix to statement No. I. 9. In the cantonment of Peshawar the number of primary operations performed was less than in the previous year, while there was a satisfactory increase in re-vaccinations. In the cantonment at Nowshera there was a decrease under both heads. No comment is called for in the case of the other cantonments in the Province where whole time vaccinators are not entertained. Cost of the Department. 10. The total expenditure incurred on account of the vaccination staff and on contingencies was Rs. 12,575 as compared with Rs. 12,200 or an increase of Rs. 375 This does not, however, include the entire cost of glycerinated chloroform lymph received from the Punjab Central Vaccine Institute which has charged for supplies of lymph
3 sent from the Depôt since October 1908, in accordance with the orders issued by the Punjab Government. In some cases the bills are still under consideration as necessary provision for the increased cost was not made in budget estimates of Local and Municipal Funds. From certain enquiries I have instituted recently, I find that the quantities of lymph supplied to certain districts is con- siderably larger than in others and as vaccinators are not always as economical in the use of lymph as they might be, the matter will be brought to the notice of the Civil Surgeons concerned with a view of reducing the monthly supply without hampering the work of vaccinators. The total cost of the department amounted to Rs. 12,575 of which Rs. 10,768 were borne by Local Bodies and the balance by Government. Cost per successful case. 11. The cost per successful case was 2 annas and 5 pies as compared with 2 annas and 3 pies in the previous year, the total number of successful operations having been 81,991 against 84,884 in 1907-08. Dispensary Vaccination, State- ment No. III. 12. At the Mustaj dispensary in the Chitral sub-agency 609 opera- tions were performed which is creditable to 1st grade Military Hospital Assistant No. 765, Rustam Ali. The Hospital Assistant at Chakdara also did 72 operations. Comparison of work done dur- ing the past eight years. 13. The figures in this statement do not call for any special comment as the results shown therein of the work done con- tinue to be satisfactory. Inspections made by the officers of the department. 14. The total number of vaccine operations was 81,181 primary opera- tions and 10,187 re-vaccinations as compared with 76,349 and 14,506, respectively, in the previous year. Civil Surgeons inspected 2,800 operations of which 66.15 primary and 48.15 re-vaccinations were found successful. The inspection work done by Divi- sional Inspectors and Superintendents of vaccination as compared with the previous year was as follows :4 From the figures presented in Appendix A, it will be seen that the number of infants successfully vaccinated in Peshawar city was much larger than the number of those available for vaccination. This is accounted for by the fact that a large proportion includes infants of nomad tribes who while passing through Peshawar on their way to and from independent territory find it convenient to have their children vaccinated in Peshawar city. It also includes many of the children of villagers who attend the weekly fairs held at Peshawar. Taking all things into consideration, it is probable that about one- eighth of the children born in the city are not submitted to vaccination. Successful vaccinations with annual ratios of deaths from small-pox. Appendix B. 16. The ratio of deaths from small-pox per thousand of the population was slightly higher in the Hazara, Kohat and Dera Ismail Khan districts than in the previous year. The unhealthiness of the year prevented many parents in these districts from submitting their children to vaccination. Particulars of vaccinations per- formed by various kinds of lymph. 17. It will be seen that during the year under report, almost all the vaccinations in the Province were performed with glycerinated choloroform lymph. A small number of persons, however, was vaccinated with animal lymph in the Dera Ismail Khan and Kohat districts. In the former, this was due to a sudden and unexpected demand by Powindas and by the Ustrans tribe among whom there were many cases of small-pox. Through the exertions of the Civil Surgeon, Dera Ismail Khan, the majority of the operations performed in the Shirani country were performed with glycerinated chloroform lymph, and the intention was to use this kind of lymph in that country for all the operations but this was not possible as owing to the limited supply of lymph from the Punjab Depôt, human lymph had to be used for a large number of persons belonging to the Chuhar Khel tribe who unexpectedly presented themselves for vaccination. No report regarding the practice of inoculation was made during the year in any of the settled districts of the Province. Reviewing the situation for the period since the formation of the Province, it is most interesting to see what a change for the better has occurred. Formerly there were several inoculators in all parts of the Province engaged in the regular and constant practice of a process that did much to account for constant outbreaks of small-pox. Gradual instruction and the breaking down of long established prejudices has made for progress, and the time seems now to be in sight when the practice of inoculation in the Province will die a natural death. Attitude of the people towards vaccination. 18. Since the introduction of glycerinated chloroform lymph, vacci- nation is becoming more popular among all classes and in most parts of the settled districts of the Pro- vince the people have shown less apathy and indifference than existed in former years. The discontinuance of animal lymph has played an important factor in lessening friction that was formerly constantly arising between vaccinators and villagers owing to the difficulty of obtaining animal vaccinifers, but a higher price has now to be paid for each successful case owing to the decision of the Punjab Government to charge for all glycerinated lymph supplied by the Vaccine Lymph Depôt. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, G. W. P. DENNYS, LIEUT.-COL., I. M. S., Administrative Medical Officer, North-West Frontier Province.

Annual Report on the working of the Vaccination Department in the North-West Frontier Province for the year 1909-10. REVIEW BY THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER. THE average strength of the Vaccination Department during the year under report was higher by one Vaccinator than in the previous year. The total number of operations performed in the Province showed a large increase over the figures for 1908-09, all in primary vaccinations. There was a consi- derable increase over the figures of the previous year in the number of success- ful primary vaccinations performed on infants under one year of age and on children between the ages of one and six years.. In the Political Agencies as a whole the number of vaccine operations shows a decrease as compared with the figures for 1908-09. The beginning made in that year in Chitral has been followed by a decrease in the work done; but it is understood that the Chitralis have taken kindly to vaccination, and it is hoped that with greater efforts and more careful supervision better results will be obtained next year. In the Sherani country also there has been a falling off, which is due partly to strained relations (which have since improv- ed) with the tribe, and partly to the inefficiency of the Vaccinator, who has been reduced and transferred. On the other hand the Kurram and Tochi Agencies show a considerable increase in vaccination activity. In the latter Agency the attitude of the people towards vaccination has considerably improved; and it is satisfactory to note that in many instances trans-border people brought their children to Kurram to be vaccinated. The Vaccination Act has not yet been brought into force in Peshawar City. The Civil Surgeon recommends its adoption by the Municipality, but the Deputy Commissioner doubts the advisability of the step. H. N.

Administrative Medical Officer, North- West Frontier Province. To C. LATIMER, ESQUIRE, Assistant Secretary to the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner, North-West Frontier Province. Dated Peshawar, the 31st May 1910. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit, for the information of the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner, the Vaccination Returns for the North-West Frontier Province for the year 1909-1910 with the following brief remarks :2 Primary vaccinations performed by the District Staff. 6. It is very gratifying to observe that in the year under report the number of primary operations increased in all the settled districts of the Province with the exception of the Hazara District, the most noticeable increase being in the Peshawar Dis- trict. In the Hazara District the descrease is described as due to want of energy on the part of Municipal members, lambardars, zaildars and others. The Deputy Commissioner is, however, moving in the matter. The total number of successful primary operations amounted to 82,159 showing an excess of 20.82 per cent. over the figures of the previous year. Re-vaccinations performed by the District Staff. 7. There has been a falling off in the number of re-vaccinations which is most noticeable in the Kohat and Bannu Districts. In the former it is generally attributed to apathy and inefficiency on the part of the Native Superintendent of Vaccination who has since been reduced to the grade of vaccinator and in the latter to unavoidable changes in the vaccination establishment. Appendix to Statement No. I. Vaccination in Political Agen- cies. 8. The total number of vaccine operations in the Political Agencies was 9,406 as compared with 10,127 in the previous year, the decrease being due to very much less work having been done in the Sherani Country where only 1,306 operations were performed against 4,972 in the previous year. The vaccinator responsible for the small amount of work done in that country has since been reduced and transferred from there. A falling off is also noticed in the work done in the Chitral Agency which is attributed partly to possible carelessness and inexperience on the part of the two Chitralis who have been trained as vaccinators and whose work could not at all times be closely supervised through unavoidable causes, and partly to the delay that occurred in vaccine lymph, despatched from the Lymph Depôt, reaching distant villages. The Chitralis, it is understood, have taken kindly to vaccination and it is hoped that, with greater efforts and closer and more careful supervision, better results in the coming vaccination season will be obtained. On the other hand, it is satisfactory to note that the two agencies of Kurram and the Tochi show a considerable increase in the amount of work done. In the former more vaccination work was done than in any year since the formation of the Province probably because 1909 was a particularly favourable year for vaccination owing to the prevalence of small pox. Apart from this, there is a tendency on the part of the villagers in Kurram and even across the border to view inoculation with disfavour owing to the evil consequences resulting from this method. In many instances trans-frontier people brought their children to be vaccinated and in others petitions asking for the services of the Government vaccinator were received. In one case a leading Syed inoculator had his own children vaccinated. This purely voluntary coming forward of the people of Kurram is a stronger argument in favour of vaccination than could be adduced by statistics. In the latter agency also the attitude of the people towards vaccina- tion has considerably improved, only one case in which hostility to the Govern- ment vaccinator was shown having come to notice. During the autumn an epidemic of small-pox broke out in and around Dir and at the request of the Nawab of Dir, made to the Political Agent of Dir, Swat and Chitral, two vacci- nators of the District Staff were deputed to work in the Dir Territory. They vaccinated 480 people of whom 187 were females. Appendix to Statement No. I. Vaccination in Cantonments. 9. There has been a satisfactory increase in the number of operations per- formed in the Cantonments of Peshawar and Nowshera which entertain their own vaccinators, the figures being 2,764 and 1,052 against 2,386 and 481, respectively, in the previous year. As already stated in paragraph 3 of this Report the post of vaccinator attached to the latter can onment was abolished by the Cantonment Authorities with effect from the 30th November 1909. In each of the Cantonments of Abbottabad, Kohat and Mardan the services of the vaccinators of the District Staff were utilized, but not so in the Cantonments of Dera Ismail Khan and Bannu. In the former vaccination work is done by Regimental Medical Officers and their subor- dinates and in the latter there is no civil population.
3 Cost of the Department. 10. The total expenditure incurred on account of the Vaccination Staff and on contingencies, inclusive of the cost of lymph supplied by the Punjab Central Vaccine Institute, was Rs. 14,743-12-9 as compared with Rs. 12,574-5-1 in the previous year The increase is due to (a) the cost of a certain amount of lymph obtained in the pre- vious year not having been paid for in that year but adjusted in the following year, (b) the entertainment of an extra vaccinator for the Mardan Sub-division, (c) a larger number of transfers among members of the Vaccination Staff who drew travelling allowance in consequence of the death of the Divisional Inspector of Vaccination of the Peshawar Division and (d) the output of work being larger than in the previous year. It will be seen that of the total expendi- ture, Rs 12,659-2-11 were borne from Local Funds, Rs. 411-6-3 from Canton- ment Funds and the balance by Government. Cost per successful case. 11. The cost per successful case was two annas and five pies, the same as in the year previous, the total number of successful operations having been 96,178 as compared with 81,991 in 1908-09. Statement No. III. Dispensary Vaccination. 12. First Grade Military Hospital Assistant Rustam Ali again performed the largest number of operations, viz., 515, at the Mastuj Dispensary in the Chitral Sub-Agency, The Assistant Surgeon at Tank in the Dera Ismail Khan District and the Compounder at Idak also performed 111 and 40 operations respectively during the vaccination year. Comparison of work done during the past eight years. 13. This statement shows that the results of the work done continue to be satisfactory. Inspections made by the officers of the Department. 14. The total number of operations was 94,701 primary and 7,866 re- vaccinations as compared with 81,181 and 10,187, res- pectively, in the previous year. Civil Surgeons inspect- ed 2,449 operations of which 96.86 primary and 73.16 re-vaccinations were found successful against 66.15 and 48.15, respectively, in the previous year. The inspection work done by Divisional Inspectors and Superintendents of Vaccination, as compared with the preceding year, was as follows : 4 Appendix B. Successful vaccinations with annual ratios of deaths from small- pox. 16. Appendix B shows the annual number of successful vaccinations and the ratio, per thousand, of population of deaths from small-pox for the last five years district by district. Particulars of vaccinations per- formed by various kinds of lymph. 17. During the year almost all the work was done with glycerinated chloroform lymph which has given uniformly good results since its introduction. The percentage of success in primary vaccinations was 95.48 and 73.18 in re-vaccinations Animal lymph was used to a small extent in the Kohat District, 132 persons having been vaccinated with this kind of lymph. Human lymph was also resorted to but only in the Sherani Country and among Powindahs passing through the Dera Ismail Khan District, 200 persons in all having been vaccinated by the arm-to-arm method. Attitude of the people towards vaccination. 18. Since the introduction of glycerinated lymph all the friction that was formerly constantly arising between the vaccinators and the villagers owing to the difficulty of obtaining animal vaccinifers has been removed. Although no apathy and indifference was shown in the settled districts by the people collectively who are well disposed towards vaccination, still there are some of the ignorant in certain tracts along the border of independent territory who, having the tradition of inoculation, as a rule do not allow vaccination except under the pressure of outbreaks of small- pox among them. Employment of professional inoculators as vaccinators. 19. With reference to paragraph 2 of the Review by the Chief Commis- sioner on the Annual Vaccination Report for the year 1908-09, Civil Surgeons in the settled districts were consulted as to the desirability of entertaining professional inoculators as vaccina- tors. There is a general consensus of opinion that, in the settled districts of the Province, the cause of vaccination would not be improved by the employment of hereditary inoculators as vaccinators in place of such men as fill the ranks of the ordinary vaccination staff who obtain quite satisfactorily the confidence of the people of the settled districts. No inoculators were forthcoming during the year, but it is possible if a few hereditary inoculators could be induced to enter the service for work near the border of independent territory, where the practice of inoculation has yet some hold and still more to work inside tribal territory, good would result from their influence. The scope of such men who would not easily be disciplined to method, figures and returns would be most suitably out- side and beyond the regular system and there they might do much good, but would be independent of more than general supervision. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, A. L. DUKE, LIEUT.-COL., I. M. S., Offig. Administrative Medical Officer, North- West Frontier Province.

Annual Report on the working of the Vaccination Department in the North-West Frontier Province for the year 1910-11. REVIEW BY THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER. THE strength of the Vaccination Department was the same as in the preceding year, but the quantity of vaccination work done has maintained the steady increase noticed in the previous year. The number in thousands of vaccinations performed has gone up from 91 in 1908-09 and 102 in 1909-10 to 107 in the year under report. The decline in the number of re-vaccinations and the reasons given are interesting. The figures from the Agencies show that vaccination as opposed to ino- culation is gaining steadily in popularity, and there is every reason to believe that at the present rate of progress inoculation will soon become a thing of the past. It is satisfactory to note that, despite the increased amount of work performed, the cost of the Vaccination Department has been slightly less than in the previous year. PESHAWAR : F. W.

S., Chief Medical Officer, North- West Frontier Province. To CAPTAIN W. L. CAMPBELL, I. A., Asstt. Secretary to the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner, North-West Frontier Province. Dated PESHAWAR, the 8th June 1911. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit, for the information of the Hon'ble the the Chief Commissioner, the prescribed Vaccination Statements for the year 1910-11 with the following brief remarks :2 vaccination, whereas the year 1909-10 was a favourable year for vaccination, owing to the prevalence of small-pox in the Kurram Agency. In the latter, it is due to an untrained Chitrali having been appointed, owing to the man who was trained in the year previous not being available for the work for a second season. As the work done by him was not considered satisfactory, it was stopp- ed, till such time as the Civil Surgeon was able to proceed on tour in that area, and to personally instruct him and supervise his work. It is important to bear in mind, that the same vaccinators should carry on the work from year to year, as the people get to know them and the vaccinators understand, and should therefore do, their work better. There were 133 secondary operations performed on account of failure of the initial operations. This number has rightly been excluded from the column of number of persons vaccinated as shown in the statements appended to this report. Average number of operations performed by each vaccinator. 5. The average number of operations performed by each vaccinator in the Province, was 3069.51 as compared with 2849.08 in 1909-10 and 2610.51 in 1908-09. The steady increase in the outturn of work is a satisfactory feature and is creditable to the vaccination staff who have, with few exceptions, done their work conscientiously and well throughout the vaccinating season. The Bannu District shows the largest amount of average work done by each vaccinator, viz. 3777.00, the Peshawar District coming next with an average of 3637.71. The Mardan Sub- Division shows the smallest amount of average work done by each vaccinator viz, 2737.50 as compared with 2490.50 done in the previous year. This, however, is nevertheless an improvement and it is hoped that the average work will be larger in future years. Percentage of success. 6. The percentage of successful cases in which the results were known, was primary 99.06 and secondary 72.95. The results obtained in the former are better than those obtained in the two preceding years. The results obtained in the latter are not so satis- factory, the percentage, viz. 72.95 being considerably lower than that recorded in the two preceding years. No reason for the difference can be adduced. Ratio of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population. 7. The ratio of persons successfully vaccinated, per thousand, of the population was 46.55 as compared with 47.36 in 1909-10 and 41.86 in 1908-09. These ratios compare favourably with those shown for the triennial period 1905-06-to 1907-08. Percentage of unknown cases. 8. The percentage of unknown cases to the total number of cases, in regard to primary vaccinations, was much the same as in the two preceding years. The percentage is, highest in the agencies and in the Peshawar District and this is not surprising as a large proportion of such cases occur among nomad tribes who, while passing on their way to and from independent teritory, find it inconvenient to delay their journey for the inspection of children who have been vaccinated. Average annual number of deaths from small-pox during previous five years. 9. The average annual number of deaths from small-pox in the settled districts of the Province during the previous five years was 807 or a ratio of 0.42 per thousand, the Peshawar District and the Mardan Sub-Division recording the largest average number of deaths from the disease. In 1910 the Dera Ismail Khan and Bannu Districts recorded the largest number of deaths from small-pox, viz. 224 and 201, respectively. Such a heavy toll would not have had to be paid had the people of the town of Paharpur and of the Bannu City submitted their children for vaccination on the appearance of the disease. Appendix to Statement No. I.3 In the Shirani Country 1,654 operations were performed. Had timely help been given by the District Authorities, more work could have been done there. The results shown are satisfactory, but in a matter like this a good deal depends on the honesty, zeal and popularity of the vaccinator, it not being pos- sible to have the work checked in that area. In the Kurram Agency the vacci- nator, who worked almost continuously throughout the year, did 3,612 operations mostlyprimary4 and partly to the amount spent on contingencies being greater. The highest expenditure, viz. Rs. 495-14-6, was incurred in the Hazara District and the lowest, viz. Rs. 69-3-0 in the Dera Ismail Khan District. In the former, the increase in the expenditure under this head is explained by the Civil Surgeon to be due to the purchase of articles of stationery both from the Stationery Office, Calcutta, and from the local market. In some other districts the expenditure on account of contingencies has also been high and I am enquiring into the matter with a view of reducing unnecessary expenditure as far as possible. Cost per successful case. 13. The cost, per successful case, amounted to two annas and three pies or a decrease of two pies, per case, as com- pared with the cost, per case, for the past two years. The total number of successful cases was 100,654 as compared with 96,178 in the previous year and 81,991 in 1908-09. Statement No. III.5 certain restricted areas to have themselves and their children vaccinated on an outbreak of small-pox. This refusal in a few instances have been traced to bad examples set by influential men, lambardars and zaildars, who refused to submit their children for vaccination. Civil Surgeons have been asked to bring such cases to the notice of the Duputy Commissioner concerned. Particulars of vaccination per- formed by various kinds of lymph. 19. During the year under report the only kind of lymph used, was in the form of glycerinated chloroform lymph obtained from the Punjab Vaccine Institute. Since its intro- duction into this Province no trouble has arisen in regard to the quality of the material supplied and what is more, its use has removed all the friction that was formerly arising between the Vaccination Staff and villagers who viewed the supplying of vaccinifers as a distinct hardship. Attitude of the people towards vaccination. 20. With few exceptions, the benefits of vaccination are fully recognised by the inhabitants of the Province. No cases of pre- judice on religious grounds have been brought to notice and it is believed that the stoppage of animal lymph has brought about more friendly relations between the vaccinator and the village folk. Employment of professional in- oculators as vaccinators. 21. For the past two years efforts have been made to induce hereditory inoculators to take up work as regular vaccinators. So far the results have been negative. In the Bannu District some inoculators were willing to serve as vaccinators but only for a small area round their homes. As these men are only known for short dis- tances from their homes, their employment as vaccinators would be of assistance, if a large number were employed. If such men could be persuaded to give up the practice of inoculation and trained as vaccinators, there is reason to believe that the cause of vaccination, more especially in the agencies, would be consi- derably improved. Efforts will continue to be made to obtain inoculators as vaccinators, but it is doubtful whether they will ever become regular paid vacci- nators subject to discipline and Government control. Vaccination inspection by Chief Medical Officer. 22. My predecessor, Lieut.-Col. Duke, inspected 41 children in the Hazara Distirict and found that all had been success- fully vaccinated. During my autumn tour in 1910 in the Districts of Dera Ismail Khan, Bannu, and Kohat, I inspected a large number of children who had been vaccinated. The results were satisfactory. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, W. R. EDWARDS, LIEUT.-COL., I. M. S., Chief Medical Officer, North- West Frontier Province.

Annual Report on the working of the Vaccination Department in the North-West Frontier Province for the year 1911-12. REVIEW BY THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER. THE strength of the Vaccination Department during the year under report was higher by one vaccinator than in the previous year owing to the entertainment of a temporary local vaccinator in Chitral. The Chief Commis- sioner notes with satisfaction that there was an increased output of work under every heading and a higher percentage of successful operations. The large increase in the number of successful primary vaccination on children under one year of age and on children between one and six years of age is also a satisfactory feature. 2. The increasing popularity of vaccination in the Agencies has been maintained. It is interesting to note that for the first time vaccination work has been undertaken in the Khyber Agency, where 407 persons were operated on. The large increase in the number of operations performed in the Amb State (Hazara District) is very noticeable. The desirability of employing as vaccinators existing village inoculators is borne in mind, and such men are entertained where available. 3. The Chief Commissioner agrees with the Chief Medical Officer as to the inadvisability of attempting to enforce the Vaccination Act with any degree of strictness in the North-West Frontier Province. The steady increase in the number of vaccinations performed is in itself a sufficient proof that the people are gradually learning to appreciate the benefits of vaccination. W. L. CAMPBELL, NATHIAGALI : Assistant Secretary to the Chief Commissioner, North' West Frontier Province. The 7th June 1912.

Annual Report on the working of the Vaccination Department in the North-West Frontier Province for the year 1912-13. REVIEW BY THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER. ONE new appointment of vaccinator in the Malakand Agency was sanctioned during the year bringing the total staff employed up to 2 Divisional Inspectors, 6 Superintendents and 37 Vaccinators. The increase in the work done under every heading in every district is a matter for congratulation. The steady increase in the numbers of successful primary vaccinations performed in the settled districts on children under one year of age and between one and six years of age was well maintained. 2. The vaccination work done in the trans-border Agencies calls for no special remark. The total number of persons vaccinated is less than that of the previous year, but this is accounted for by the absence of any report from the Amb State, where 2,000 persons were vaccinated in 1911-12. 3. It is satisfactory to note that the cost per successful case fell to 1 anna 8 pies, the lowest figure which has yet been reached. 4. Once more the number of vaccinations done in Peshawar City on children under one year of age considerably exceeded the number of births registered during the year, a remark which applies in a lesser degree to some of the smaller towns in the Province. This affords yet another reason for insist- ing on a more careful supervision of the registration of births, to which atten- tion has been drawn in the Annual Report on the Sanitation of the Province for 1912-13.

A., Secretary to the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner, North- West Frontier Province. Dated Peshawar, the 29th May 1913. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit, for the information of the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner, the prescribed annual Vaccination statements for the year 1912-13 with the following remarks. Administration. 2. As Chief Medical Officer, North-West Frontier Province, the charge of the Vaccination Department was held by me throughout the year. Statement No I.( 2 ) Re-vaccination. 7. Re-vaccinations also show a small increase but not such a large one as in the previous year or as I should like to see. People readily bring their children for vaccination, especially if small-pox is prevalent or threatened, but the utility of re-vaccination is not yet grasped by the poorer classes. In the settled districts the total number of persons operated on was 7 per cent. of the total population.

Annual Review on the working of the Vaccination Department of the North-West Frontier Province for the year 1913-14. REVIEW BY THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER. MAJOR H. G. S. WEBB, the newly appointed Deputy Sanitary Com- missioner, was placed in charge of the Department during the year, and compiled this report. For the rest the establishment was the same as in the previous year. The total number of vaccinations performed was 164,853, an increase of 12,113 as compared with the figures for 1912-13. The increase was entirely in primary operations, secondary operations having fallen off by 8,618. The figures support the District and Agency reports, which are to the effect that the people are not hostile to primary vaccination, but regard a repetition as unnecessary and irksome. That the protection conferred is, however, understood is shown by an increase in the demand for the Vaccinator's services when small-pox tends to become epidemic. It is satisfactory to notice that, in spite of a considerable increase in the amount of work done, the cost of the Department has remained practically stationary, and the cost per successful case fell to the low figure of one anna and seven pies. The statement of work done during the last 14 years shows a steady increase of vaccination, and last year's figures for successful primary vaccinations, which up to then constituted a record, have been largely surpassed in the year under review.

S., Sanitary Commissioner North-West Frontier Province, To S. E. PEARS, ESQUIRE, I. C. S., Secretary to the Chief Commissioner, North-West Frontier Province. Dated Peshawar, the 29th May 1914. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit, for the information of the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner, the prescribed Annual Vaccination statements for the year 1913-14 with the following remarks :( 2 ) Re-vaccinations. 7. Re-vaccination shows a decrease probably because small-pox has notbeen epidemic. The decrease is greatest in the Bannu and Peshawar districts, especially the latter. Appendix to Statement No. I.( 3 ) Percentage of success recorded by Civil Surgeons was 92.47 for primary and 54.21 for re-vaccination. Divisional Inspectors and Superintendents record a success of 98.05 and 98.24 for primary and 83.75 and 93.40 for re- vaccination respectively. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner doubts the accuracy of the latter figures, especially as the Superintendents in inspecting report a higher percentage of success in re-vaccination than the Vaccinators themselves, viz. 93.40 against 91.22. I entirely agree with this criticism.

Annual Review on the working of the Vaccination Department of the North-West Frontier Province for the year 1914-15. REVIEW BY THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER. LIEUTENANT-COLONEL IRVINE was in charge of the Department for over ten months of the year under review. Major Stiles-Webb, Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, proceeded on three months' privilege leave in May 1914 and reverted to military duty four days after h.s return from leave. The total number of vaccinations performed during the year under review was 154,179, a decrease of 10,674 as compared with the figures for 1913-14. The decrease is most marked in the case of secondary operations. The services of two Vaccinators were required for cholera duty for three months in the Hazara District, but the decrease is more generally attributable to the unpopularity of re-vaccination among the people of the Province when small- pox is not prevalent. No death from small-pox was registered between the 1st of October 1914 and the 31st of March 1915. The total cost of the Department was slightly less than in the previous year, and, in spite of the decrease in the number of operations performed, the cost per successful operation only rose from Re. 0-1-7 to Re. 0-1-8. It is satisfactory to note that members of trans-frontier tribes are to some extent taking advantage of the opportunity of their presence in the towns of the North-West Frontier Province to havc their children vaccinated.

PAGE. 1 Introductory ... ... ... ... ... ... 1 2 Administration ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ib. 3 Statement No. I.No. 28902 Vaccination according to ages. 6. Of the successful primary vaccinations, 83,052 were performed oninfants under one year of age and 38,682 on children over one and under six years of age, a decrease in the former of 5,847 and an increase in the latter of 1,905. The heavy mortality among children, particularly infants, during year as pointed out in paragraph 9 of my Annual Sanitary Report for 1914 explains the cause of decrease. Re-vaccinations. 7. There has been a further falling off in the number of re-vaccinations which is most noticeable in the Peshawar and Kohat Districts. In the former, not a single re-vaccination was performed. This may, to a certain extent, be attri- buted to a year of comparative freedom from small-pox, the absence of which results in apathy regarding vaccination amongst villagers. Appendix to Statement No. I. Vaccination in Political Agencies. 8. As in the settled districts, so in the agencies, there has beenconsiderably less activity in vac- cination work. In the Kurram, the prevalence of cholera during the busy months of the year, when it was considered advisable to suspend vaccination operations, accounts for the falling off in numbers ; while in the Tochi it is attributed to the unsettled condition of that part of the country. In the Chitral Sub-Agency work was very much hampered by the deterioration of lymph caused by frequent delays and damage in transit. It is, however, satisfactory to note that the modern method of vaccination is popular with the Chitralis and that the Mehtar of Chitral continues to give his sympathetic support to the work. Appendix to Statement No. I. Vaccination in Cantonments. 9. In the Cantonments of Abbottabad, Dera Ismail Khan and Mardan,the services of the vaccinators of the District Staff were utilized, but not so in the Cantonments of Kohat and Bannu. At Peshawar Cantonment, which entertains its own vaccinator, 3,689 operations were performed, while at Nowshera Cantonment. where the work is done by a Military Sub-Assistant Surgeon attached to the Cantonment General Hospital, only 283, which includes 167 secondary operations.

Report on Vaccination in the North-West Frontier Province for the year 1915-16. REVIEW BY THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER. LIEUTENANT-COLONEL T. W. IRVINE, I. M. S., Chief Medical Officer, was in charge of the Vaccination Department throughout the year. The estab- lishment working under him was the same as in previous years, viz. two Divi- sional Inspectors, six Superintendents and thirty-eight vaccinators. The attitude of the people towards vaccination has on the whole been, favourable; but re-vaccination is considered unnecessary and troublesome except under the pressure of small-pox in epidemic form. It is satisfactory, therefore, to note that, though there has been a further decrease of 10,465 in the total number of operations performed, the number of secondary operations has increased by 5,894, and this although there has been no serious outbreak of small-pox during the year. The decrease in the total number of vaccine operations is to be attributed largely to local unrest and threatened troubles on the frontier, particularly in the Peshawar District, and partly, in Hazara, to the employment of the whole Vaccination staff on cholera duty for a period of two months. In the Kurram, Tochi and Malakand Agencies, and in Sherani country satisfactory progress has been made. The sympathetic support of the Mehtar has been of great value in Chitral, and small-pox is now practically unknown in his State. The total expenditure of the Department was Rs. 15,352, or an increase of Rs. 181 over the figures for the previous year. The greater part is met from Municipal and Local Funds. The cost per successful case rose slightly in consequence of fewer operations having been performed. It amounted to one anna and ten pies. C.

S., Secretary to the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner, North-West Frontier Province, Dated Peshawar, the 9th June 1916. SIR, I HAVE the honour to forward, for the information of the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner, the Annual Returns on the working of the Vaccination Department in the North-West Frontier Province for the season 1915-16, and to offer the following remarks thereon. Administration. 2. Lieutenant-Colonel T. W. Irvine, M.B., C. M., F.R.C.S.E., D.P.H., I. M. S., held charge of the Vaccination Department throughout the year. Statement No. I.( 2 ) Re-vaccinations. 7. There has been an increase in the number of re-vaccinations in almost all the districts, and this is no doubt due to special efforts having been made in this respect in compliance with the instructions issued by my pre- decessor. Every reasonable assistance was afforded by the Civil authorities in the matter of re-vaccination, but it cannot be denied that the value of secondary operations is not understood nor appreciated by the poorer classes.

Report on Vaccination in the North-West Frontier Province for the year 1916-17. REVIEW BY THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER. THE annual report on the working of the Vaccination Department in the North-West Frontier Province now under review reveals on the whole a satisfactory state of affairs. The establishment employed during the year was practically the same as in 1915-16, and the Department was in the charge of Lieutenant-Colonel T. W. Irvine, I. M. S., Chief Medical Officer, for half the year and of Major H. Crossle, I. M. S., officiating Chief Medical Officer, for the other half. There was an increase of 18,374 in primary vaccinations, but. a decrease of 13,664 in re-vaccinations, which illustrates the continued apathy and indifference of the ordinary native of the Province to the value of secondary operations. The staff of Vaccinators deserve credit for their energy and efforts in a somewhat trying year and are to be congratulated on having performed on an average about 4,218 operations per vaccinator compared with 3,714 in the year before. The percentage of successful cases, the results of which were known, continues to be good, being 98 in primary and 91 in secondary vaccinations, and the cost per successful case continues as low as 1 anna 8 pies. It is disappointing, however, to note that in the Political Agencies only 6,882 persons were vaccinated compared with 10,218 in the preceding year, and that in the districts the mortality during the year under review from small- pox was above the average for the previous three years. This latter fact, how- ever, was due mainly to an outbreak in the Peshawar City, where the Vaccination Act is not in force. The Chief Commissioner notes that during the year the Peshawar Cantonment Committee took over the management of vaccination in the Cantonment. E. H.

S, Sanitary Commissioner, North-West Frontier Province, To E. H. KEALY, ESQUIRE, I. C. S, Secretary to the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner, North-West Frontier Province. Dated Peshawar, the 15th September 1917. SIR, I HAVE the honour to forward, for the information of the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner, the Annual Return on the working of the Vaccination Department in the North-West Frontier Province for the season 1916-17, and to offer the following remarks thereon. Administration. 2. I held charge of the Vaccination Department from the 1st April 1916 to the 17th May 1916, and again from the 20th November 1916 to the 31st March 1917, Major Crossle having held charge of the Department for the intervening period, viz., from the 18th May to the 19th November 1916. Statement No.I.( 2 ) during the past three years in spite of pressure of work resulting from the war. This is encouraging, and further efforts will be made in this direction, more especially in the Peshawar District where the decline is most marked. In this district the small number of secondary operations done is explained by the Civil Surgeon to be due to the blockade of Mohmands and Swatis and to malaria fever of a malignant type. Average number vaccinated by each Vaccinator. 5. The average number of operations performed by each Vaccinator in the Province was 4217.97 as com- pared with 3713.63 in 1915-16 and 3965.34 in 1914-15. The large outturn of work during the last vaccina- tion season is a satisfactory feature, and is creditable to the Vaccination staff, who have, with few exceptions, done their work well. The Hazara District shows the largest amount of average work done by each Vaccinator during the triennial period, viz., 6467.50, the Peshawar District coming next with an average of 5279.33. The Dura Ismail Khan District shows the smallest amount of average work done by each Vaccinator during the past three years, viz., 2915.75, and this, I think, is due to the unrest on the Dera Ismail Khan border. The percentage of success. 6. The percentage of successful cases in which the results were known was primary 98.03 and secondary 91.34. The results obtained under both these heads are about the same as in the preceding two years. Ratio of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population. 7. The ratio of persons successfully vaccinated per thousand of the population was 50.85 as against 46.70 in 1915-16 and 50.05 in 1914-15, and compares favourably with those shown for the triennial period ending 1913-14. In the Agencies, where there is no proper supervising staff, the percentage is low. Percentage of unknown cases. 8. The percentage of unknown cases to the total number of cases in regard to primary cases for the Province was 3.13 and re-vaccinations 6.62, much the same as in the preceding two years. The percentage was the high- est last year in Cantonments (primary 9.80 and re-vaccinations 9.38). An explanation for this has not been furnished. Average annual number of deaths from small-pox during previous five years. 9. The average annual number of deaths from small-pox during the previous five years was 881, or 43 in the settled districts of the Province. Appendix to Statement No. I.( 3 ) Appendix to Statement No. I.( 4 ) In Beckettganj-Khawajaganj Notified Area, where the Act is in force, only about half the number of children available last vaccination season were vaccinated. Appendix B. 18. Last year the mortality from small-pox in the settled districts of the Province was above the average for the previous three years, 156 deaths from the disease having been recorded. Of this number the Peshawar District contributed no less than 106, Kohat District 28, Mardan Sub-Division 18, and Hazara only 4. It is a matter for congratulation that no deaths from the disease have occurred in the Bannu District for the past three years, and the Dera Ismail Khan District has also remained immune since the year 1915. In June 1916 small-pox broke out in Peshawar City and several deaths from the disease occurred. House to house vaccination was resorted to in the infected areas; this was viewed with disfavour, and was not adopted elsewhere. In Peshawar the Vaccination Act is not in force. Lymph obtained from the Punjab Vaccine Institute. 19. The Province continues to obtain its supplies of glycerinated chloroform lymph from the Punjab Vaccine Institute. Last year 3,211 tubes at a cost of Rs. 1,974-2-10 were obtained. The average number of vaccinations performed with each tube varies from 36 to 52 42. Attitude of the people towards vaccination. 20. In the greater portion of the Province the benefits of vaccination are fully realized, but there are still certain places where inoculators are active. Training of Vaccinators. 21. Recently entertained local Vaccinators require further training and better education. This I propose to attempt to remedy by establishing short classes at the head-quarters of districts. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient Servant, T. W. IRVINE, LIEUT.-COLONEL, I. M. S., Sanitary Commissioner, North-West Frontier Province. N.W.F.P. Govt.

REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE FOR THE YEAR 1917-18. BY LIEUT.-COLONEL T. W. IRVINE, M. B., C. M., F.R.C.S.E., D.P.H., I. M. S., Sanitary Commissioner, North-West Frontier Province. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Price Re. 0-10-0 or 10 pence. PESHAWAR: GOVERNMENT PRESS, NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE. 1918.
Report on Vaccination in the North-West Frontier Province for the year 1917-18. REVIEW BY THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER. THE strength of the Vaccination establishment employed during the year was one more than in the previous year owing to the appointment of a vaccinator in the Wana Agency. According to Statement I the total number of vaccinations performed during the period under report was 130,061. This represented a decrease of 28,161, as compared with the previous year and was the smallest number of operations performed in any year during the last five years The decline is attributed by the Sanitary Commissioner to the prevalence of malaria, and as a contributory cause, to indifferent work by some members of the staff. In his report for 1916-17 the Sanitary Commissioner proposed to remedy this latter defect by establishing short classes at the headquarters of districts ; it is not known whether this proposal was carried out nor what success attended it, but it might be possible perhaps to arrange for a few selected men to attend the special training classes recently instituted at the Vaccine Institute at Lahore. Re-vaccinations decreased by over 30 per cent. While the attitude of the people is certainly not hostile to primary vaccination, re-vaccination is not regarded by them with the same favour. The Peshawar District, however, showed a remarkable rise from 54 to 363 in the number of secondary operations. The average number of operations performed by each vaccinator was very creditable in the Hazara District (7,302.72) and was more than three times the average number in the Bannu District. Successful primary cases in which the results were known averaged 98.93 per cent, but they were at the rate of only 42.46 per mille of the population, compared with the quinquennial average of 49.95 for the previous five years, a moderately satisfactory result. The Chief Commissioner welcomes the increased activity in the Political Agencies, but although the total number of vaccinations, both primary and secondary, was more than in 1916-17, as a result chiefly of the employment for the first time of a vaccinator in the Wana Agency, yet it was still below that of the year 1915-16. Valuable work was done in the Chitral Sub-Agency, as the absence of small-pox testifies, and the Chief Commissioner takes this opportunity of acknowledging the assistance given by the Chitral Durbar. On the whole perhaps the most satisfactory feature of the year's report is the low death-rate from small-pox which, so far as registration statistics go, was only .03 per mille compared with .08 in the previous year and an average of .35 for the quinquennium. The duties of Sanitary Commissioner were again discharged efficiently by Lieutenant-Colonel Irvine, I. M. S., who held charge as well of those of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner.

Dated Peshawar, the 7th June 1918. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit, for the information of the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner, the prescribed Annual Vaccination statements for the year 1917-18 with the following remarks. Administration. 2. I held charge of the Vaccination Depart- ment throughout the year. Statement No. I.( 2 ) Re-vaccinations. 7. As already pointed out in previous reports, the value of secondary operations in certain parts of the Province is not appreciated by the poorer classes, to whose indifference is mainly attributed the falling off under this head. Further efforts will be made in this direction, more specially in the Hazara and Bannu districts, where the decline is mostly marked. In the Peshawar District 363 secondary operations were performed during the year under report as compared with 54 operations made in the previous year, thus making an increase of 309. Every reasonable assistance was afforded by the Civil authorities in the matter of re-vaccination. Appendix to Statement No. I.( 3 ) Statement No IV.( 4 ) Attitude of the people towards vaccination. 18. From the report of the various Civil and Agency Surgeons it would appear that the people are not hostile to primary vaccination, but regard secondary vaccinations as unnecessary and irksome. The protection conferred is understood. This is shown by the increase in the demand for both vaccination and re-vaccination when small-pox tends to become epidemic.

REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE FOR THE YEAR 1918-19. BY MAJOR H. CROSSLE, M.D., D.P.H , D.T.M., & H (CAMB), I. M. S., SANITARY COMMISSIONER, NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE.

Report on Vaccination in the North-West Frontier Province for the year 1918-19. REVIEW BY THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER. THE report under review can hardly be considered a satisfactory one in view of the fact that there has been a decline of 13,381 in the total number of persous vaccinated, a rise in the ratio of deaths per thousand from small-pox from 0.03 in 1917 to 0.08, and an increase in the cost per successful case of vaccination. This retrogression is attributed to the influenza outbreak at the end of 1918, which hindered the operations of the vaccinators and caused a considerable waste of lymph opened for use, but only partly used owing to lack of patients. The decrease in vaccinations was entirely among primary opera- tions, secondary ones showing an increase of 2,579. A satisfactory feature of the report is the substantial increase in the number of persons vaccinated in the Agencies and the Sherani country, but the tribesmen are still sceptical of the value of re-vaccination. The Chief Commissioner thinks that a little more care might be taken over the printing of the diagram showing death rates, etc., the coloured columns being so badly done as to convey no clear idea of the facts they purport to represent. There is in the report also no statement of the actual number of deaths from small-pox during the year. The Chief Commissioner is pleased to observe the marked increase in vaccination work in all the cantonments in the Province. The establishment employed during the year 1918-19 was the same in number as in the preceding year. The late Lieutenant-Colonel T. W. Irvine held charge of the Vaccination Department until his death on January 26th, 1919, when Major H. Crossle took charge. E. H.

REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE FOR THE YEAR BY LIEUT.-COLONEL G. TATE, M.B., I.M.S., SANITARY COMMISSIONER, NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Price Re. 0-12-0 or 1 shilling. PESHAWAR : PRINTED AT THE CIVIL & MILITARY STEAM PRESS. 1920. No. 199Report on Vaccination in the North-West Frontier Province for the year 1919-20. REVIEW BY THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER. THE Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Major Stiles-Webb, I. M. S., is to be congratulated on having lent a touch of colour to what is usually a mere congeries of statistics by introducing a brief, but most interesting, review of small-pox and vaccination from the earliest times. The figures for primary operations show a certain recovery: there were 9,911 more such operations than in 1918-19, the figures for which year, however, were lower by no less than 15,837 than those for the year before. The cause of that heavy decline was the influenza epidemic, but in the absence of any such cause during the year under review the Chief Commissioner cannot yet consider the results as fully satisfactory. He is, however, glad to note an increase of 7,818 over the previous year's excellent figures for secondary operations. The unsettled conditions throughout Agency areas caused a still further decrease in the number of operations performed there. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner notes the interesting fact that the work done since the formation of the province has nearly doubled. There was again the curious phenomenon of an excess of primary vacci- nations over births registered. As the report points out, however, this was not entirely due to defective registration, but also to the practice of the trans- frontier migratory population having their children vaccinated while they are passing through our districts. Small-pox appeared in epidemic form in almost every district through- out the province, and this fact no doubt to some extent accounts for the increased number of operations recorded. There is no religious prejudice against vaccination, but apparently until the fear of an epidemic is upon them most of the people are unwilling to undertake the slight trouble of revacci- nation. Charge of the Vaccination Department was held by the late Major Crossle till the forenoon of 29th September 1919, when he was relieved by Lieutenant-Colonel J. H. Hugo. P. J. G.

S., Sanitary Commissioner, North-West Frontier Province. To THE HON'BLE MR. P. J. G. PIPON, C. I. E., M. C., I. C. S., Secretary to the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner, North-West Frontier Province. Dated Peshawar, the 17th September 1920. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit herewith, for the information of the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner, the Annual Vaccination Report for the year 1919-20, and to offer the following remarks on the working of the Department. 2. Before proceeding to give the Statistical details about vaccination as carried out in the North-West Frontier Province for the year 1919-20, it may not be out of place to prefix a few general considerations, concerning Small-pox, the disease for the prophylaxis of which, Vaccination is carried out. Definition. Variola or Small-pox is an acute specific fever characterised by a more or less general eruption passing through the stages of the papule, vesicle, pustule, and often scar. History. Small-pox was prevalent in India and China before Christian Era and the practice of inoculation against it was started in China as far back as A.D. 590. Whether it arose de novo in India and Africa we cannot say, but there are possibly two varieties of the disease, viz., the ordinary Small-pox which eventually spread to Europe, and so to America; and an African type known as Amaas, or milk-pox. In India there was a special worship defined in the Atharvaveda, and there were special prayers to be said by the Brahmins when practising inoculation. In Africa Ruffer and Ferguson found an eruption on the skin of a Mummy belonging to the period of the 28th dynasty (1100-1200 B.C.) which they believed to be Small-pox; so that it is quite possible that there has been from immemorial an endemic focus in the heart of Africa. From these two endemic foci of the disease, Asia and Africa, it undoubtedly spread all over the world. An Arabian Physician Rhazes, whose full name was Abu Bakr Muhammad Ben Zakriya'-r-Razi, wrote a work on medicine about A.D. 900 called Kitab-ul-Mansuri which was divided into ten Chapters, in one of which he gives the earliest accounts on record of Small-pox and Measles. He died in A. D. 923. In Europe, in the middle ages, records of its prevalence were kept up in the monasteries. Vaccination was first introduced by a general practitioner Dr. Jenner in 1798. Vaccination was made compulsory in England in 1854; but under the Act of 1898 the &quot;Conscientious objector&quot; has been allowed latitude. The last pandemic of the disease occurred in 1871-72.
( 2 ) The immunity conferred by Vaccination becomes less and less after the lapse of 9 or 10 years; hence in all Civilised countries it is the practice to re-vaccinate all children under 12 years. In Germany this is compulsory (1873-1874), and was a factor in the comparative freedom of the German army from Small-pox in the Franco-Prussian War of the seventies. Vaccination as distinguished from inoculation, was first introduced into India in 1799. Etiology. The causative organism is unknown, but that has not prevented various protozoal bodies being described as such; the most important of these being the Cytoryctes Variolæ or the Guarnieri bodies (1892). These are described as small spherical homogeneous bodies found in the cells of the skin Councilman, Magrath, Calkins (1903) and later De Korté (1905) &quot;confirmed&quot; these findings and went so far as to weave a life history of the parasite which is generally considered to be the outcome of a keen imagination and a sense of farther sight; one might almost say in this case, &quot;Perception&quot; was Father to the parasite.&quot; Dissemination. The method of the spread of the disease is indefinite; various agencies, the breath, clothes, and especially the air, have been cited. We can only say with certainty that the virus, whatever its nature is diffusible by air for distances of 3/4 to 1 mile, and probably enters the body by means of the respiratory passages. Administration. 3. The charge of the Vaccination Department was held by late Major H. Crossle, from the commencement of the year till the forenoon of 29th September 1919 when Lieutenant-Colonel J. H. Hugo, relieved him. Statement No. I( 3 ) Frontier Tribes. In the Wana Agency nothing has been known of the Vaccinator since its evacuation, and hence no vaccination was performed there throughout the remaining period of the season. The Mehtar of Chitral continued to give his sympathetic support to the work. Appendix to Statement No. I ( 4 ) The percentages of inspections by the Civil Surgeons of the total number vaccinated was 2.07 primary and 6.42 re-vaccinations and those by the Divisional Inspectors and Superintendents were 23.90 and 74.46 primary and 21.36 and 73.00 re-vaccination respectively. Inspections by Deputy Sanitary Commissioner. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner personally inspected Vaccina- tion in 4 towns and 13 villages. The total number of children inspected and verified was 405 and the number of vaccination and re-vaccinations carried out by him, or under his immediate supervision was 34. He corrected the methods of certain Vaccinators explaining at the time the reasons for so doing.

Report on Vaccination in the North-West Frontier Province for the year 1920-21. REVIEW BY THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER. THE number of vaccinations performed has decreased by 13 per cent., the number of re-vaccinations by 27 per cent., and the average number of operations performed by each vaccinator by 11 per cent., as compared with the totals of the previous year. The main reason assigned by the Chief Medical Officer for this falling off is the discontent among the vaccination staff caused by their inadequate pay, and the consequent difficulty in recruiting to fill vacancies caused by resignations. In consequence of the decrease in the average number of operations performed by each vaccinator the cost of each successful operation has risen by 27 per cent. The Chief Commissioner considers that the results reported are disappointing and trusts that the great improvement in this important branch of the medical administration of the Province foreshadowed by Colonel Anderson may materialise during the coming year. Small-pox appeared in epidemic form in Dera Ismail Khan and Bannu districts : the total number of deaths recorded was 2,073 an increase of 312 on the total for the previous year. H. A. F.

SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit the annual vaccination statements for the year 1920-21. Administration. 2. The charge of the Vaccination Department was held by five different officers during the year as follows :( 2 ) under report. Of the total operations performed 97,405 were primary and 18,762 secondary vaccinations, both figures being less than the corresponding figures for last year by 11,257 and 7,108, respectively. The figures for the six districts show a decrease of vaccinations in all except in Mardan, when compared with the operations carried out in the pre- ceding year. They are as follow :( 3 ) Appendix to Statement No. I.( 4 ) was inspected, and there only 18 cases were seen. The percentage of successes recorded by Civil Surgeons was 86.16 for primary vaccinations and 74.08 for re-vaccinations. The Divisional Inspectors recorded a success of 98.20 for primary vaccinations and 68.63 for re-vaccinations and Superintendents 98.61 for primary and 91.61 for re-vaccinations. It may, however, in this connection be pointed out that the percentage of inspections by Civil Surgeons of the total number vaccinated was only 0.95 of primary vaccinations and 5.57 of re-vaccinations while the Divisional Inspectors inspected a percentage of 23.64 primary and 9.57 re-vaccinations and Superin- tendents 75.73 primary and 65.92 re-vaccinations. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner reports that he inspected the vaccina- tiou of 92 towns and villages during the year and inspected 1,358 children, but he gives no details as to the percentage of successes among the cases seen.

Report on Vaccination in the North-West Frontier Province for the year 1921-22. REVIEW BY THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER. IN his review on the Vaccination Report for 1920-21 the Chief Commis- sioner deplored the substantial decrease in the number of vaccinations performed as compared with the record for the previous year. In view of the improve- ment then anticipated the results of the past year's work cannot but be regarded as disappointing. With the same establishment as that maintained in the previous year[ The text of the Vaccination Report is limited to 5 pages. ] CONTENTS. PARA. PAGE. 1. Administration ... ... ... ... ... ... 1 2.

S., Secretary to the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner, North-West Frontier Province. Dated Peshawar, the 9th June 1922. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit the annual vaccination statements for the year 1921-22. Administration. 2. The charge of the Vaccination Department was held by me throughout the year, excluding a fortnight in March when Lieutenant-Colonel J. Husband, I. M. S., officiated for me. Statement No. I.( 2 ) Vaccination according to ages. 6. There were 83,984 successful primary vaccinations performed, 50,838 of which were on infants under one year, and 25,603 on children between one and six years of age. The successful vaccinations were at the rate of 28.10 per mille of the population, the average for the preceding year being 37.05. Re-vaccinations. 7. The value of re-vaccination is not fully appreciated by the majority of the population unless small-pox is prevalent. Only 11,70S re-vaccinations were performed during the year which is 7,054 less than in the preceding year. Appendix to Statement No. I.( 3 ) The inspection work done by Divisional Inspectors and Superintendents of Vaccination as compared with the previous year will be seen from the following table :Diagram showing the death-rates from small-pox per 10,000 of population during the year 1921-22, the average rate of mortality from small-pox per 10,000 of population for the five years ending 1920-21, and the proportion of successful vaccinations during the year 1921-1922 and the preceding six years in each district of the North-West Frontier Province.
