The water supply is insufficient for the needs of the population and owing to a bad monsoon is running short already. Proposals to dig new wells have been put forward but seem to have been filed. The water supply must be increased and as soon as possible. There is an idea that the water running from the trenching grounds returns to the main well supply of Ajmer (Bhaonta). It is partly for this reason that incinerators are recommended. 57. The Sanitary Sub-Committee of the Municipality appears to be anxi- ous to work for the remedy of many of these ills and I thank the Members who undertake the duties of Ward Superintendents and are regular attendants both at the meetings of the Conservancy Sub-Committee and the weekly in- spections of the city.

I hope a good Assistant Health Officer will soon be appointed. 59. The Commis- sioner, Ajmer-Mer- wara, reports that the rules for the improve- ment of village Sani- tation were restricted to the same villages as last year as detail- ed on the margin. 60. The Sanitary condition of the villages in all the three Sub-divisionsis reported to have been satisfactory. The villages are kept clean and thehealth of the people is also satisfactory. VACCINATION. STATEMENT I. 61. In Ajmer-Merwara including Nasirabad Cantonment, the total number of persons vaccinated was 12,564 against 14,242 in 1920-21, a decrease of 1,678. The total number of Primary Vaccination fell from 14,154 in 1920-21 to 12,700 in 1921-22 and the number of Primary successful Vaccination from 13,421 to 11,693. 62. The aggregate of the both Primary vaccination and re-vaccination was 13,108, showing a decrease of 1,304 as compared with last year. 63. The average number of Vaccinators employed during the year under report was 15.39 with one Indian Superintendent. The increase of .39 is due to the fact that a third vaccinator was employed for the Ajmer Municipal area in January 1922. Each Vaccinator performed an average of 816 operations against 949 in the previous year. 64. Fresh calf lymph was obtained upto 31st October 1921, from Punjab Vaccine Institute and thereafter from Manpur Vaccine Depôt in Central India whence it was received cheaper and of a good quality. 65. The Civil Surgeon, Ajmer-Merwara, inspected 861 vaccinated children in 11 towns and villages against 1,221 in 1920-21, of whom 852 were found successful. 66. The Superintendent of Vaccination, Nasirabad, examined 25 children against 732 in the last year of whom 14 were found successful. 67. The Indian Superintendent of the Vaccination, Ajmer-Merwara, in- spected 329 towns and villages against 304 in 1920-21 and examined 4,600 vaccinated children against 5,032 in the previous year. 68. The number of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of popula- tion was 24.06 against 27.20 in 1920-21. 69. Vaccination operations were carried on with great difficulty not only owing to persons concealing their children and refusing to produce them for vaccination but because villagers are now being misguided by Non-co-operatons.
6 DISPENSARIES IN RAJPUTANA. General operations in Indian States. 70. The vaccination returns from the Indian States show a decrease innumbers during the season under report owing to non-receipt of the figures from Jaisalmer, Dholpur, Karauli and Kushalgarh. The total number of Primary vaccinations in Indian States was 221,903 of which 206,129 were successful as compared with 234,803 Primary and 219,617 successful operations in 1920-21. Re-vaccination rose from 507 in 1920-21 to 1905 in the year under report. 71. There were 183 vaccinators against 182 vaccinators in 1920-21, 2 additional vaccinators having been employed in Marwar and 1 in Kushalgarh resigned. No vaccinator was employed in Deoli Cantonment during the season; vaccinations were performed by the Sub-Assistant Surgeon attached to the Agency Hospital there. 72. 20.99 per thousand of the population in the Indian States were successfully vaccinated against 20.85 in 1920-21. Expenditure on Vaccination in Ajmer-Merwara. 73. The total expenditure on vaccination in Ajmer-Merwara wasRs. 4,671-11-2 against Rs. 4,363-8-4 in 1920-21. An increase of Rs. 308-2-10 is due to an increase of pay of vaccinators and in rate of travelling allowance. The average cost of each successful case was 75 pies against 61 pies in 1920-21. Expenditure on Vaccination in Indian States. 74. The total expenditure of Indian [States was Rs. 54,402-7-4 as com- pared with Rs. 50,041-4-0 in the previous season, the increase in cost being due to pay and travelling allowance to vaccination staff. The average cost of each successful vaccination in different States varied from 897 pies in Abu to 20 pies in Sirohi. 75.
