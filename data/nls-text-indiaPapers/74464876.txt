Proceedings of the Hon'ble the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab in the Home (Medical and Sanitary) Department, No. 285L, P., dated 9th March 1901. Read-- Report on Inoculation in the plague-infected areas of the Punjab and its Dependencies from October 1900 to September 1901, by Major E-Wilkinson, I. M. S, Chief Plague Medical Officer, Punjab. Report on Plague in the Punjab from 1st October 1901 to 30th September 1902, by Major E. Wilkinson, I. M. S., Chief Plague Medical Officer, Punjab. Report on Plague and Inoculation in the Punjab from 1st October 1902 to 30th Septem- ber 1903, by Major E Wilkinson, I. M. S., Chief Plague Medical Officer, Punjab. REMARKS.The   repor s  now  under  review cover  the plague history of the Punjab during the two years  1901-02 and   1902-03,   and in   addition give the history of anti-plague inoculations in the Province during   1900-01,    During the two latter years the people had nothing to  fear from  reporting plague as no compulsory measures were in force,   and it is believed  that reports   of cases and deaths were freely made.    The reporting of plague cases and deaths has been com- pulsory throughout and still is so, but the reporting agency is everywhere  defec- tive, particularly in its inability to distinguish plague from  other diseases, and in some places, such as Ludhina during 1901-02, it broke   down altogether  during severe outbreaks.    An instance  of   the  breakdown  of  reporting is  afforded   by Gujrnwla, in which district deaths  only appear to have been  brought on to the record in July 1903 : the district figures for the month   give 1,892 cases and  the same   number   of    deaths.    Moreover,    the  monthly   or   weekly   returns   were commonly affected by the omission   to report   cases and deaths in the   period in which they occurred and their subsequent  inclusion  in a  later period when they came to light.    The inclusion of deaths which   occurred  previously  account   for such returns as that of Silkot during June   1902,   when  988   cases   with   1,010 deaths were reported, or that of Lahore for June 1903, when 2,425 cases and 6,867 deaths were reported.    The statistics incorporated   in the   reports   are therefore admittedly incomplete.    There is, however, reason   to believe that   the  death re- turns convey an approximately correct idea of the state of plague in the Province, for while many plague deaths were omitted from them, these omissions were pro- bably balanced by the inclusion in them of deaths not due to plague.    The records of cases are much more vitiated by  the inclusion among  plague cases  of illnesses due to other causes.    To make this clear it is necessary only to look at the figures for cases and deaths reported as due to pneumonia and septicmic plague,    The case mortality on the reported figures is so low as to render it certain that many illnesses from ordinary pneumonia or   fever  have  been  ascribed   to  plague.    It should,   however,   be  recollected   that   plague    occurrences   among  inoculated persons have always been more freely reported than   other   plague   occurrences, and  that  in   1902-03  an   elaborate   system   of  record   and verification   by   an exceptionally strong Medical staff   was   in force, so   that   the figures relating to inoculation, particularly for 1902-03, may be accepted  with some   confidence   as practically correct. 2. When Sir Charles Rivaz assumed the Lieutenant-Governorship of the Punjab in March 1902 it was feared that the Province had " still to experience the full force of the calamity with which it has been visited." This fear has, unfortunately, been realised. By the end of 1900-01 the Punjab had had 14,573 plague cases and 8,394 deaths, and the disease was established only in parts of Jullundur, Hoshirpur, Silkot, Gurdspur, Ludhina, Ambala and Ferozepore. The number of infected districts rose in the following year to 16 and again in 1902-03 to 21, while the number of reported plague cases and deaths, which for 1900-01 had been 9,908 and 5,542 res- pectively, rose in 1901-02 to 267,581 cases with 174,041 deaths and in 1902-03 to 325:747 cases with 195,141 deaths. By the end of 1902-03 the total number of plague deaths registered in the Province amounted to 377,576, and the whole Province was infected except certain tracts on its borders. On the west and south-west, the Mooltan Division, except a part of the Jhang District, was still uninfected ; in the north-west, the disease was confined to limited areas in Jhelum and Rwalpindi ; in the south-east, Delhi and parts of Gurgaon and Rohtak were still uninfected; and in the Hills there was practically no plague.    But the disease  was   established in the whole  of  the  rest  of  the
2 Punjab, and it had spread up to the foot of the Hills, beyond the River Jhelum, and as far as the boundaries of the United Provinces and Rjptna It is sug- gested that the immunity of that portion of the Punjab which is still free is due to the fact that it is for the most part sparsely populated. A few more years will show whether plague will extend to the North-West Dry Area and to the Hills. It, however, is remarkable that, though Mooltan and Bahwalpur reported out- breaks in 1901-02, neither in Bahwalpur nor in Mooltan was the outbreak severe or followed by a recrudescence. There is some reason to believe that in Mooltan the outbreak reported as one of plague was really one of cerebro-spinal meningitis, and the same may have been the case in Bahwalpur. Plague infection imported into the Hills appears to have died out after giving rise only to limited outbreaks such as those at Kasauli, Sabthu, Nlagarh, and Nrpur in Kngra. 3. The severity of the epidemic in certain districts, as well as the rapidity of its spread in recent years, can be judged from the following figures relating to districts which have suffered most, viz.-   No. District.

In addition to the districts mentioned above, outbreaks were reported during 1901-02 in Gujrt (553 deaths), Karnl (333), Shahpur (206), Jhang (176), Simla (44 deaths in Sabthu and 1 in Simla bazr, the deceased being a man who came up from Sabthu and developed plague immediately), and Mooltan (20) ; while isolated cases, resulting in 20 deaths, occurred also in Hissar, Delhi, Kngra, Jhelum, Rwalpindi, Dera Ghzi Khan, Minwli and Montgomery. 5. In 1902-03 there were renewed outbreaks in all districts previously reported as infected districts, except Mooltan. In Mooltan there were a few isolated cases only ; such cases occurred also in Delhi and Minwli ; and the total number of plague deaths reported in these three districts was 10 only. In Kngra 12 deaths were reported in a small outbreak at Nrpur, which did not spread. In Simla the outbreak in Sabthu continued, but it died out after Octo- ber, and only 9 deaths were reported in the district during the year. Three im- ported cases occurred in  Simla itself, but none of these terminated fatally.    In
3 Gujrt 2,829 deaths were reported, in Jhang 2,597 in Karnl 1,701, and in Shahpur 585. The infection took root during 1902-03 in the Rewri Tahsil of Gurgaon (3,700 deaths), the Sadr Tahsil of Rwalpindi (455), Hissar (468), Montgomery (228, chiefly in the Diplpur and Gugera Tahsls), Rohtak (220, all but 6 in the Jhajjar Tahsl), and the Jhelum Tahsl of Jhelum (83). 6.    The reports now under review confirm conclusions previously  arrived at regarding the course and spread of   plague     The  outbreaks  in   the   Punjab are subject to regular seasonal variations  and  reach   their  climax  between the months of March and April in each  year.    The   Chief Plague   Medical  Officer suggests that there is also a period of decline in December  owing  to the  influ- ence   of   cold,    but   this   decline  has   been  noticed  in   7   only   of  30 more serious district outbreaks   (viz., those in which the number of deaths reported in any month was 250 or more) which have occurred  since   the  first  infection   of the Province.    The disease is spread from village to village chiefly by the agency of human intercourse and infected  clothes.    Within  villages  rats play   a great part as agents in its spread, and they may spread it from one village to  another in the immediate neighbourhood, but not to another at  any   distance.    The soil and houses convey infection, and in places which   have  once  been   infected re- crudescence occurs without the reimportation of infection.   There is still no good reason to believe that grain and articles of food  or merchandise are carriers of infection.    There are, however,  some points in connection with outbreaks in the  Punjab in the years under review which indicate that as yet we do not know the causes which really govern the course of plague.    Thus the rural areas and small towns have been most severely visited and the larger  towns have for  the most part enjoyed considerable immunity from serious outbreaks, although infec- tion has been introduced into many large towns and although in towns we are less able to take adequate measures to stamp it out.    Townsmen are not as ready as villagers to do what is required, evacuation in  towns is impossible,  disinfection can  never   be   made absolutely   thorough,    human  communication  is   closer than in villages, and  rats  are  more numerous.    Though   imported  into Delhi, Amritsar and Lahore, the infection has not taken root in Delhi and has not given rise to severe outbreaks in the other two  cities.    The  immunity   of  these and other large towns may perhaps be due to the fact that  their streets and  houses have paved streets and floors, and that a large proportion  of  their  inhabitants live on upper storeys.    Another remarkable fact is that the outbreaks in different districts have differed in  severity   during  the  same  year  to an  extraordinary extent.    It is also extraordinary that the severity of  the  disease   has varied  in the same district from year to year so   much  as it   has   done,  for  instance,   in Ludhina and Gujrnwla.    The extent to  which   precautionary   measures were adopted in different districts and different  years does not afford  a satisfactory explanation of the variations noticed.    Evacuation is the measure which has had the greatest influence on plague in the Punjab, and it is true that the  people of Ludhina in 1901-02 and of Gujrnwla in 1902-03 were  less inclined  than  the people   of  some other districts to  resort to this measure, but  other  districts which suffered in those years less than Ludhina and Gujrnwla, as for instance Lahore and Silkot, also neglected evacuation, and in the  years  when Ludhina and Gujrnwla escaped more lightly evacuation was not more commonly resorted to in these districts than in the years of their severe visitation. 7. In the absence of more definite information regarding the points noticed in the last paragraph, Sir Charles Rivaz thinks that it would serve no good purpose for him to discuss them. He, however, remarks that the fact that the Punjab outbreaks were mostly village outbreaks afforded peculiar opportunities in this Province for the effective application of precautionary and preventive measures. That these opportunities have not been more fully utilized is deplor- able. But during the years under review it has been quite impossible to compel the general adoption of proper measures. The peasantry have indeed exhibited a sturdy independence under the calamity with which they have been visited, and the absence of panic among them, except in a few cases, is a matter on which they are entitled to pride themselves, but their calm- ness and stolidity have been founded on fatalism and have amounted to an unwillingness to accept advice and a refusal or evasion of measures which would
4 in all probability, have averted outbreaks from many localities and would have lessened their severity in all. In view of this attitude of the people and in view of the area and number of villages affected, any measure of compulsion not supported by the wishes of the majority of the people themselves has been entirely out of question. As long as the number of infected villages was limited and Government had the resources and establishment neces- sary for dealing with them individually, the policy of compulsion was practicable and justified. But it aroused opposition while it was enforced, and during the period now under review, the opposition to plague measures which the peo- ple thought the State authorities intended to press gave rise in Patila. to a serious riot on the 19th of February 1902. The only reason for the absence of discontent and disturbance in the Punjab has been the absence of compulsion. In the circumstances it was necessary frankly to leave the adoption of plague measures to the option of the people concerned and to relieve them from all restrictions and orders which, while they failed in restraining the spread of infection, gave rise to inconvenience and irritation on the part of those to whom they were applied. At the beginning of the period under review certain compulsory measures were still in force, including those intended for the prevention of the spread of plague by the collection of infected persons at fairs, marriages and caste-gatherings, and for the surveillance of persons from infected districts, but these have now been abandoned ; though the willingness of Government to use compulsion when the feeling of the people demands it has been made clear by the issue of rules permitting the eviction of suspected strangers from villages- and muhallas where the residents object to their presence, and permitting of the compulsory evacuation of a minority in villages where the majority desires evacuation. 8. The opinions of District Officers from which extracts are given by the Chief Plague Medical Officer in his report for 1901-02 were received and fully considered by the Lieutenant-Governor before he issued his orders for the plague measures prescribed in the Plague Manual of October 1902. The measures prescribed in the Plague Manual and in force during 1902-03 were reviewed in detail with the advice of a strong committee of officers with plague- experience before His Honour ordered the issue of Punjab Government Notifica- tion No. 1936 L. P., dated the 16th of November 1903, in which the measures now in force were discussed and laid down. 9.    The measure on which most reliance has been   and must be placed is evacuation.    The value of   this   has   already   been   established,   and   the- reports for  1901-03 contain further evidence in its favour.    It  is by adopting this   measure that the  people  can   help   themselves   best.    They   must   not, however,   look to Government   for   assistance  in money or establishment.    It is out of the question for   Government   to provide   huts   or   extra   police   and chaukdrs.    Any attempt to provide huts   generally for infected   villages would involve  vast  expenditure   and   much  peculation,   and  the   people   can   usually hut themselves without difficulty, while they   can also guard against the danger of theft during  evacuation by taking out  their property   with   them   or   ap- pointing extra chaukdrs for its protection.    The present is  the time  at  which evacuation can be  resorted   to   with the most advantage and   the  least  incon- venience to the people, and it appears to   the  Lieutenant-Governor  that the cli- matic objections to the measure in the Punjab are exaggerated.    The   climax of the outbreaks in this Province occurs at a season when the people can leave their villages and live in   their   fields   without  feeling the discomforts of cold or rain, and even where it has not been possible previously to evacuate villages   infected in the cold weather, evacuation in March, April and May is   calculated   to   have a powerful   influence  in   reducing   the ordinarily heavy plague mortality of these months.    The evacuation of villages in which infection has  already  taken  root or where its existence may be evidenced by the death of men or rats is a   matter of the first importance.    But to be effectual evacuation   must   be complete  and villages must be left empty till the  infection  in them has died out or been killed by disinfection or desiccation.    The people, it  is  true,  recognise  the  value  of the measure, and it is everywhere resorted to more or  less.    But  His   Honour regrets that it is usually resorted to in a manner which  deprives  it  of  much  of
5 the good which can be effected by it. The Lieutenant-Governor desires that effective evacuation should be encouraged in every way possible such as by an announcement that in adjudicating on the claims of village notables to rewards, grants, privileges, or appointments open to them-especially plague rewards for which a special allotment is now made-great weight will be given to the extent to which they have been able to influence their fellow villagers in favour of effective evacuation. Zaildrs and Inmdrs may be considered bound by Rule 170 (vi) of the Rules under the Land Revenue Act to exert their influence in securing the adoption of plague measures, particularly evacuation, and a failure to do so may be regarded as a neglect of duties which in flagrant cases may entail punishment. 10. Disinfection ranks next to evacuation as a measure of practical importance, but its value is very much less. The people do not desire to have their houses disinfected chemically by the official agency maintained for the purpose, and they will not give the measure an adequate trial. They object to the gangs going into and turning out their houses, but the use of perchloride cannot be entrusted to any but trained men. It was found possible to disinfect chemically by official agency in 1901-02 only 148 villages completely and 116 partially, and in 1902-03 only 15,503 rooms. These numbers form so very small a percentage of the total number of infected villages and rooms that the disinfection performed can have produced no very appreciable effect upon the spread of plague. Moreover, disinfection is not calculated to stamp out infection unless it is applied to a village at the commencement of an epidemic when only a few houses are infected and all these are thoroughly disinfected, and it has most commonly been applied under other conditions. In 1901-02 the rules permitted compulsory disinfection in certain cases, but all power of compulsion has now been withdrawn, and it has been decided ordinarily to give the people free chemical disinfection by official agency in villages only when it is asked for at the beginning of an outbreak in the villages concerned, though in towns where evacuation cannot be effected and greater reli- ance has to be placed upon disinfection free chemical disinfection by official agency will be  offered in the case of every house that is infected. 11. In place of chemical disinfection desiccation has lately been offered to the people as a valuable measure. Desiccating stoves were used in the latter part of the 1902-03 epidemic and 15,214 rooms were desiccated by the plague staff. The reports under review do not contain exact information and statistics from which the value of the operation can be exactly gauged, but the general experience of the officers who have been concerned in working desiccators is very much in their favour. It is a matter for congratulation that the people have readily adopted the idea of desiccation, and with an improved and effective stove, which has now been devised and can be easily and cheaply made, His Honour trusts that desiccation will give good results in future. 12. The Disinfection Dept which was established in Jullundur during 1902 has proved useful in connection with experiments on desiccators and their supply to districts, and it has also effected the purpose of its establishment as a centre for the preparation and issue of solutions and accessories required for chemical disinfection by official agency and for the sale of phenyle to the people for use by themselves, for which, however, there is at present no great demand. Under the financial arrangements which will in future govern the apportionment of plague charges between the Provincial and Local authorities, disinfection will be the heaviest item for which Local Bodies will be responsible, and it is gratifying to note that the operations of the Dept have considerably reduced the cost at which chemical disinfection can be performed. 13. The segregation and treatment of patients and the avoidance of con- tact with infected places, persons, and things, unfortunately continued to receive insufficient attention from the people, and all attempts to coerce them in these matters have been abandoned, though power is given by the rules recently issued for the enforcement of segregation in certain special cases in Municipal towns, and the rule under which the people of an uninfected village or muhalla can secure the eviction from  their midst of persons coming  from an infected
6 place has been in force since October 1902. There is evidence in the reports to show that the people are occasionally disposed to keep suspected strangers out of their villages, though they have not as yet been able to act with sufficient determination or combination to do so successfully. 14. Plague inspection and disinfection posts were maintained on the approaches to the town of Simla throughout the year. They were at first situated at Klka and Tawi, between Simla and Jutogh, and at Mashobra. The post at Mashobra was found to be unnecessary ; it was closed in August 1902, and has not been re-opened. In April 1902, after plague had broken out in Klka itself, the post there was removed to Tra Devi near Simla. During March, April and May 1903 inspections at Klka were resumed for the examination of the Government of India establishments on their move from Calcutta to Simla. In 1903 the Tawi post was transferred to a more convenient site at Tattu, close to its original situation. All travellers passing through the posts were liable to inspection, and if suspicious were detained under observation or allowed to proceed after disinfection. Lists of persons to be kept under surveillance were forwarded regularly from the posts to Simla, and the persons concerned were kept under observation by a special agency which was mainly voluntary. The plague rules sanctioned for Simla and other Hill Stations provide for the application of stringent and compulsory measures of segregation evacuation and disinfection in case plague should occur. The report for 1901-02 does not state the number of persons examined at the Simla posts during the year, but it must have been very considerable, as while inspec- tion was carried out at Klka over 300 or 400 persons were disinfected daily. During 1901-02 the only cases of plague detected at the posts were 2 or 3 detected at Klka. One case passed the Tawi post without being detected there, but the necessary precautions were taken without delay on its discovery in Simla, and the infection did not spread. In 1902-03 the number of persons inspected at the posts was 203,029. Of these 64,707 were disinfected and 19 were detained, but only 1 plague case was detected. Three cases, however, passed into Simla without detection, but the infection introduced by them was promptly   stamped   out. 15. Inspection posts for the protection of Dalhousie and Murree were opened in April 1902 at Dunera and on the Rwalpindi-Murree Road, and after being closed during the cold weather were re-opened in April 1903. One case of plague occurred in Murree just before the Murree post was es- tablished, but subsequently no case was discovered either at Murree; or at the post. Dalhousie escaped without any plague occurrence, and during the two years of its working only one case was detected at the Dunera post in 1903, The numbers of persons inspected during 1903 were  21,943 at Dunera and 28,289 at the Murree post: 2,884 persons were disinfected and 6 detained at the former post ; and the numbers of persons disinfected and detained at the latter were 508 and 47  respectively. 16. Special arrangements for the inspection of travellers by railway were made in connexion with the Delhi Darbr. Over 15,000 passengers were in- spected, and 6 plague cases were detected at four Railway Stations in the Punjab, and there were also inspections at Ghziabad. The management of plague measures at the Darbr was under the control of the Government of India, but a special staff was sent to Delhi by the Punjab Government to deal with any outbreak t hat might occur outside the Darbr area. It is a matter for congratulation that there was no outbreak of plague among the multitudes which collected for the Darbr. 17. It may be noted that in addition to the inspection posts maintained by the Punjab Government inspection posts were maintained by Native State authorities for the protection of the towns of Kapurthala, Mler Kotla and Faridkot. From neither of these towns was plague kept out, and experi- ence has shown that, except for the protection of places to which the ap- proaches can be effectually guarded, such as the Hill Stations, plague inspec- tion posts are useless. They will not again be established in the plains, but the Simla, Dalhousie, and Murree posts will be continued and railway inspections will be instituted on the Klka-Simla Railway.
7 18. The system of punch-marking railway tickets issued at stations in infected areas with the object of facilitating the surveillance of travellers from such areas has remained in force during the period under review, but it is now impracticable to secure the observation of travellers at the places of their -destination and the punch-marking system is doing no good in the Punjab, while it gives subordinate Railway officials opportunities of harassing and blackmailing travellers. The Government of India has under consideration the question of discontinuing the system. 19. The Lieutenant-Governor in 1902 came to the conclusion that conveni- ence and advantage would result from the employment of steam disinfectors at inspection posts and large towns, and it was finally decided to purchase 10 machines of the Bowman pattern. There was unfortunately some delay in carrying out the orders in this matter, but all the machines were received in the Punjab by the end of March 1903. They have proved most useful at inspection posts, but their advantages are not yet sufficiently appreciated in the large towns to which they have been sent, and His Honour trusts that every endeavour will be made to popularise them. 20.    Some attention was paid during the years under review to  measures intended for the killing-off of rats.   The people are opposed to such measures, and no successful method has yet been devised for   wholesale  rat  destruction.    The Lieutenant-Governor has now decided that it is undesirable to incur any consider- able expenditure in further experiments. 21.    The distinctive feature of the plague measures  adopted  in   1902-03 was an  attempt to protect the people by very extensive anti-plague inoculations. This attempt was decided on in consideration of the success which had  attended inoculations in  the Punjab  during previous epidemics.    Inoculations were intro- duced into the Province directly after the  plague  broke  out.    In   1897-98   and 1898-99  they  were  confined  to  the  limited areas in the districts of Jullundur and Hoshirpur which were then infected, and the numbers inoculated  were  not large,  being  3,918  in   1897-98 and 9,184 in the following year.    But under the plague  system  then  in force  a  close  watch  was  kept  on  the results of the inoculations  and  accurate  statistics. were  obtained   regarding   them.     These statistics as  a whole  and individual instances of immunity conferred by inocu- lation indicated its value as a  prophylactic.    The Punjab  figures  for   1897-98 were   passed  under review  by  the Indian Plague Commission, but though they were   not   regarded  as  conclusive they   as  well  as  other   evidence   collect- ed   outside   the  Punjab  led   the Commission   to recommend  inoculation as  a valuable plague measure.    In 1899-1900 inoculation was again  offered to  the inhabitants  of  infected  villages,  which  were   still  confined   to Jullundur  and Hoshirpur.    30,829 persons were inoculated during the epidemic of  the   spring of 1900 and chiefly in evacuation  camps  among  the  people of  infected places. These  inoculations  also  were shown   to  be  beneficial  by   statistics  collected regarding them  and  particularly by  their  results  in  individual instances such as  those  of   disinfecting  gangs  and  of   the  villages  of   Nawashahr, Khatkar Kaln, Kahma and Mangowl.    The plague-infected  tract was  still limited  in area and the people were willing to co-operate in an attempt to deal with   plague by inoculation, and in the summer of 1900 endeavours  were made   to  inoculate the whole of the people of the tract in   question  in  the  hope  that   this  would prevent a recrudescence.    The proportion of the people inoculated was remark- ably large.    From the end of May to the end of September, and mainly in June, July and August 1900, 231,970 persons were inoculated.    Of   the  total   number inoculated in 1899-1900  222,244  were  residents  of   the  infected  tract  which had an area of   500  square   miles  and  a  population   of  345,220.    The  hope, however, that inoculation  would stamp out  plague  was  not  realised.    Plague re-appeared in the spring of 1901.    It is, nevertheless, remarkable  that the  first cases  of  the 1900-01 epidemic were reported outside   the inoculated  area,  and there  is  reason  to  believe  that    inoculation    considerably    delayed   the re- appearance  of    plague   in  this  area and  that  it  very  favourably influenced the severity  of  the disease  there  when  it  did  re-appear.    On this re-appear- ance inoculation was again offered to the people.    In Jullundur and Hoshiarpur
8. as many as 180,720 persons .(Jullundur  135,454, Hoshirpur 45,266) submitted to the operation, and all but 3,815 of these were inoculated by the end of March 1901.    The statistics relating to the inoculations done in the hot weather of 1900 and  in the spring of 1901 were not as accurate as those relating to the  inocula- tions previously done in the Punjab.    The epidemic was more extended  and  the plague staff was harder worked, while the attempt, hitherto maintained, to deal thoroughly with each infected village by compulsory measures, was abandoned. The statistics, however, have been compiled with great labour and after very careful checking of the registers containing the names of the persons inoculated as well as those containing the names of persons who were attacked by and died of plague.    There is, therefore,   some  reason  to  believe  that  they  are  fairly trustworthy.    From them  the Chief Plague Medical Officer in paragraphs  71 and 72 of his Inoculation Report for 1900 01   has  been  able to  show  that in comparison with the epidemic of 1897-98 the incidence  of plague attacks on the population of regularly infected villages within the inoculated area was reduced to less than half and the case mortality in  that area was reduced from 62 to 40 per cent., while outside that area   the  case  mortality   in   1900-01   was   slightly greater than that of \ill\897-98 and the incidence  of plague  attacks  was  greater than it was in the  inoculated  area  in  the  same  year.    The  figures  for  case mortality outside the inoculated area afford  reason to believe that  the  disease had not  naturally  undergone any  decrease of  virulence, and   " in the absence of any other  known factor"   the  advantage  of   1900-01   over 1897-98   in the inoculated area   " may be attributed   to inoculation.3'    A statement  regarding selected villages incorporated  in  paragraph   73   of  the   Chief  Plague  Medical Officer's   Report   shows  that   inoculation   in   the  hot   weather  of   1900   con- ferred   distinct  advantage upon  the  people in   protecting  them  from   plague attacks in 1901, and  that this   advantage   was  increased in the  case   of  those villages which were also inoculated during the spring   of   1901.    In villages not inoculated in the hot weather of 1900 or in the spring of 1901, 379 per  cent,   of the population was attacked and  the  case  mortality  was 68.88  per  cent ;   in villages of which 83.5 per cent, of the  inhabitants   were  inoculated only   in   the spring of 1901, the rate of attack was 2 66 per cent, and the case mortality  was 54.34 per cent. ; in villages of which 91.1 per cent, of the inhabitants were inocu- lated in the hot weather of 1900 and in which no inoculations were  done  in   the spring of 1901, the attack rate was 2.23 per cent., with a case mortality of 4902 per cent. ; and villages inoculated both in the hot weather of 1900 and the  spring of 1901 (86.6 per cent, of the inhabitants being done in the  hot  weather  and   71.7 per cent, in the spring) had the lowest rates of attacks and   case   mortality,   viz., 2.05 and 40.97 per cent, respectively.    These figures relate to  villages  in  which there was no plague between May   1900 and   the epidemic  of   1900 01, and the inoculations of 1900  taken   into  account   were   all   done  after- May   1900  and principally   in   July.    In  paragraph  46  of  his report  referred  to,  the   Chief Plague Medical Officer gives details for  13 villages in Jullundur and 13 villages in   Hoshirpur   to  illustrate   the results   of  the  inoculations  of the spring of 1901.    All  these  villages  are   selected   because  there  was  reason   to  believe that  the   statistics relating   to   them   were   specially   correct,   and    all   but   3 had  been  inoculated  in the   hot   weather  of   1900.     All  persons  inoculated before September 1900  are  reckoned  in  the  statement  as   uninoculated,   and since  the  inoculations  of  the  hot  weather  of   1900 appear to have exerted a considerable  influence  on   the  epidemic  now  in  question,   the   Chief   Plague Medical  Officer's figures do not show the full extent to which the inoculated had an advantage over the uninoculated.    They show, however, that in a total   popu- lation  of  36,154  exposed   to  infection,   and which was calculated to consist of a daily   average  of   11,959  uninoculated   and   24,195  inoculated  persons,   the percentage  of attacks  among  the former was 369 per cent, as compared with 1.32   per cent,   on   the  latter,   while  the  case mortality  of  the   uninoculated was  52.15   per  cent,  as  compared  with   32.60  per   cent,   for  the inoculated. After the   climax   of   the    epidemic    of    the    spring    of    1901,  inoculations were   introduced   into  infected   districts   outside  Jullundur   and    Hoshirpur. In Ferozepore 5,587   persons were  inoculated in   102   villages,   in   Gurdspur 4,162   persons were  inoculated  in   20  villages, and  in   Silkot  3,018  persons were  inoculated in   14 villages.    Since  these operations  were  for   the  most
?9 part performed after the decline of the outbreaks in the  villages   of   the  inocu- lated persons, they afforded no statistical  evidence of  the  efficiency  of  inocu- lation.    But they tended to familiarise the minds of  the people with   the opera- tion  and    to   dispel    the    mistrust  and fear with which it  is  usually  looked upon by those who have   had no   previous  experience   f   it.    As   a   matter   of fact what   was   done   in   1901   produced a considerable demand  for   inoculation in the next plague season, 1901-02.    No   attempt,   however,  was  made  in   that season to press  it   upon   the   people,   and   all that   was   done   was   to   inocu- late as far as possible those who desired   it.    A   desire   for   it   was   usually   ex- pressed   only   by   the   people   of   infected  places    at the  time when plague there was at its height,   but during the  climax   of  the  outbreaks the demand was so keen that the limited Medical staff which was   on   plague   duty  found   it impossible in certain districts to   inoculate  all   who   wished   to   be   done.    It   is reported that   many   persons   performed   considerable   journeys   and   underwent considerable   personal  inconvenience   in   order   to   present   themselves   for   the operation.    The total number of inoculations done between  the   1st   of  October 1901   and  the 31st  August   1902 was   211,503, chiefly   in  February   (26,015), March (41,590), April (47,612), and May   (35,721).    The   numbers   inoculated in the districts in wnich most operations were   done are   given   in   the following statement :- District. 1901-02. MONTHS IN WHICH MOST INOCULATIONS WERE DONE.

Unfortunately it was found impossible accurately to follow up the results of the operations of 1901-02. The press of work was very great and the staff that had to cope with it was insufficient, while in some cases the severity of the outbreaks disorganised the reporting agency. In Ferozepore the inoculations were mainly done after plague had begun to decline, and hence statistics of its protective value cannot be obtained. In many districts no statistical statement of the results is forthcoming. In Ambala, Hoshirpur and Silkot the local officers were able to collect statistics which can be accepted as fairly correct, and these evidence the value of the operations. The results are apparently unfavourable in Ludhina only. The figures collected for this district give a higher case mortality among the inoculated than among the uninoculated The district, however, was one in which the reporting agency was thoroughly disorganised, and there is reason to believe that the statistics are altogether incorrect. The results were undoubtedly protective in many indivi- dual cases and inoculations came well out of the test to which they were sub- jected,  which was  a severe  one,  since the  operations were performed only on
?1O persons who were exposed to infection in places where  plague  was at its height, and many persons who were already incubating plague were unavoidably operated upon.    No information was secured as to the maximum duration of the protection afforded, but statistics were compiled  with reference to a considerable number of persons  showing the number of days which intervened between their inoculation and attack and the results of their attacks, and these statistics indicate that some protection was afforded immediately after  inoculation,   that the   protective value of the  operation  increased up to   three   months from   the   date of inoculation, and that it  lasted even after  three months.     That   the  duration   of  protection is considerable is evidenced by the facts already mentioned above regarding  the influence on   plague in 1901   exercised in Jullundur and Hoshirpur by   inocula- tions performed during the hot weather of 1900.    It should be   noticed here that in the course of all the operations mentioned above no accidents due to the use of bad fluid came to  light.    Had there been any such   accident it is certain that it would have  been   reported, since rumours of   the   dangers   of  inoculation   were prevalant and all   minor  accidents   due   to   it   were   brought   to  the   notice  of the  Medical Officers concerned and   in many   cases   exaggerated.    Such minor accidents   consisted   mainly   of  the   formation   in   a few   cases of abscesses  at the   seat of inoculation.    In one or two cases   it   was alleged that death   had followed the operation, but in all these cases it was clearly proved that the deaths were due   to   plague   contracted before  inoculation.    Any  harm   caused by the operation or any reason to belief that it was prejudicial would certainly have been brought   to  light.    Everywhere,   however,  the impression of all officers who had experience   of  the results of   inoculation was  very   strongly   in its   favour,   and the people when not already convinced of its   value  were   open   to   conviction if a strong effort to   press   inoculation upon  them   should   be   made.    In   Ambala, Ferozepore and   Gurdspur   inoculation  appeared to be in demand, as it was in Jullundur, where it was done only on a written application  for it ; in   Hoshirpur and Ludhina the people were willing to resort to it when plague  was severe ;  in Silkot the people were beginning to understand its advantages ; and   in  Lahore also it was remarked   that   the people  would  accept  it if they were pressed   to do so. 22.    Sir Charles Rivaz had before him in the hot weather of 1902 reports and statistics which put him in possession  of  the   main facts   set forth  in the preceding paragraph.    Therefore when  he   considered how  Government  could with the greatest   hope of success assist the   people  to   combat the outbreak of 1902-03, which he feared would  be  very   severe   and widespread, he  turned to inoculation.    Other  plague  measures   had  failed ; Government   was  not  in  a position  to  enforce  them, and   the people  were not ready to combine for  their effective adoption ; inoculation was a measure which offered individuals a chance of   protecting themselves even in the absence of combined action ;   there was no other measure by which individuals could so protect themselves ;   and there was good reason to believe that very large numbers would  accept without compulsion inoculation if Government advised them to resort to it and   provided  them with adequate  facilities  for doing   so.    It  was anticipated  that  inoculation  would restrain plague in the Punjab and decrease the risk of its spread to other parts of India, and it was believed that it would avert plague attacks  from numbers  who would otherwise fall victims to the disease and would save the lives   of  numbers even if they were attacked.     It was not expected that inoculation would at once stamp out   plague,  but  it   was   hoped that  the  success   of  the  operations   in 1902-03 would render it  increasingly easy to deal with outbreaks   in   succeeding years, and would confine those outbreaks  to  constantly   narrowing limits.    The Lieutenant-Governor, however, felt that no scheme would be adequate which did not make it possible to inoculate in advance of plague at least two-thirds o   the population of the 13 districts in which the disease had taken its firmest hold.    It was calculated that for a scheme of this magnitude 70,000 doses of prophylactic fluid would be required daily during the period of the operations.   The only existing source of supply was the Plague Research Laboratory at Bombay" and before any other action was taken the Laboratory authorities were asked if they could supply the required amount.    On the 17th of June the Laboratory  authorities   gave  an assurance that the amount could be  supplied and  that  special arrangements
?11 would be made to meet the Punjab requirements. The details of the scheme were then worked out and the Government of India were addressed regarding it on the 30th June 1902. The administrative arrangements necessary for the operations necessitated much thought and labour and involved large expenditure, but the benefits which would follow success induced the Lieutenant-Governor to proceed with his scheme. The Government of India approved of it and agreed to assist the Punjab Government in meeting the necessary expenditure and in supplying the necessary Medical staff 23.    The officers of the Indian Medical   Service  who   had   been   placed at the   disposal   of the Punjab  Government for inoculation took up   their duties in the beginning of September and in, that month a considerable number of opera- tions were performed in a few districts, viz., Ambala, Hoshirpur,   Jullundur   and Gurdspur.    The   Medical   men   who   were  especially   engaged   in England for the scheme did not arrive in the Punjab till the   middle   and  end   of  September, and    it    was   arranged  that   they   should   not   go   out  into   the   districts   till October, the intervening time being spent in instructing   them as   to their   duties and providing  them with the equipment and staff required by them.     There was some delay in   getting them   into full   working  order   as   soon  as   was   desired. They were at first unable  to move   freely out   on tour   because tents   were   not available,   for,  though   tents   had    been  ordered   in    good  time,   the   demand created    by   the    Delhi    Darbr  caused   delay   in   their delivery.      Moreover, the   arrangements   at   the   Jullundur   Disinfection   Depot,    which   was    utilised as   a   centre   for  issuing    all   their  requirements   to    inoculating officers,   did not work well to start with.    There was delay in the issue of registers   and forms without   which   inoculations could   not   proceed,   and   appliances,   fluid,    camp furniture,   &c., in some cases failed to  reach promptly the officers for whom they were intended.    Further, the Plague Research Laboratory at Bombay, with which arrangements  for  the   supply   of fluid and instruments had been made, failed to supply the  full   quantity   which  the Punjab Government understood   would   be forthcoming.    At the end of August the Punjab Government had in hand less than 50,000 doses of fluid, and it had been understood that this stock would be supple- mented by the daily receipt of 70,000 doses from the  Laboratory.    The Labora- tory, however, was able to supply only 160,091 doses from the 28th of September, when   supplies commenced,   to   the   29th   October,   chiefly   towards the end of October.    The short supply of fluid crippled the operations.    It   became   neces- sary   to   instruct   Civil Officers, who had been   put on special duty to " preach" inoculation   and  otherwise   assist   in   the  operations,   that efforts to induce the people to come forward for inoculation should  be restrained till  more fluid was available.    In   many   cases   inoculating  officers   had not sufficient  instruments or fluid with which to operate on all those who actually did present themselves. Finally,   the Lieutenant. Governor   regrets to   have to   place  on   record   the fact   that   a   certain   number   of  the   37   doctors   sent   out   from   England  for the   operation proved entirely unfit   for   the work.    One was returned from the Punjab  on  the   day   after  he  reached the Province ;   3 others were suspended about   the   middle  of   October,  and   the  services    of   these    were    dispensed with ;   and another had to be released from his engagement   in   February   1903. The   majority   of   the   Medical  men engaged in   England   gave  satisfaction in every  way, but  it  is   unfortunate  that   the system under which selections were made rendered it possible to admit such men as those who proved unsatisfactory, and whose character and conduct soon became so notorious   that   they   were  not only   useless  as  inoculating officers,  but also a hindrance to the success of the operations in the districts to which they were posted. 24. In the districts in which a considerable number of inoculations was done in September the operations were in fair working order in October, but though the available supply of fluid was husbanded by confining operations as much as possible to districts in which there was most demand for inoculation, it was not possible during the whole period of the operations to make anything approaching a full use of the whole staff. In several districts, such as Gurds- pur, Silkot, Lahore, Gujrnwla and Gujrt, the  operations did not commence
?12 on any considerable scale till the middle of October, and in all districts the special- staff did not really get to work until that time. The manner, however, in which the operations started in spite of all difficulties, and the extent to which it was possible in some districts to resume them in January, as well as the results of the inoculations performed, afford clear evidence that, except for the fatal check which the operations received from their suspension in the beginning of No- vember, on account of doubts regarding the safety of the fluid then being supplied by the Laboratory, and on account of a deplorable accident which followed a series of inoculations in Gujrt, the operations would have been remarkable for their success and would have achieved the objects for which they were under- taken. 25. In the middle of September the Punjab Government was informed not only that the Plague Research Laboratory was unable to supply the number of doses which had been originally promised, but also that the fluid which it proposed to supply would be prepared by a method different from that which had been fol- lowed in the preparation of the fluid hitherto used in the Punjab. When the change in the process of manufacture was notified to the Lieutenant-Governor, it was practically impossible to do more than to take steps to assure himself that it was safe to use the new fluid, and to allow the scheme to proceed, while a very careful watch was kept on the operations It soon became apparent that the pro- portion of the new fluid which was unfit for use was many times greater than had been the case with the old. The unfitness was judged by the smell of the con- tents of bottles and observation of their colour and general appearance. Reports received from inoculating officers in all parts of the Province showed that bottles of bad smell or containing fluid of an abnormal appearance were not uncommon. Abscesses occurred more frequently with the new fluid than they had with the old, and though they might possibly have been due to careless inoculation, there was good reason to believe that they were due to impurities in the fluid itself. More- over, it was reported that the reaction of the new fluid was insufficient according to the standard fixed for the old, and for this reason doubts as to its prophylactic value were aroused. Finally a few deaths were reported to have closely followed inocu- lation, and though subsequent investigation showed that they were not due to that cause, the reports of these deaths added to the suspicion with which the new fluid was regarded. In consideration of all the circumstances His Honour came to the conclusion that it would not be justifiable to expose the people to the risk of inocu- lation with a fluid in which he and his officers had not complete confidence. On the 30th of October he felt compelled to ask the Plague Research Laboratory to discontinue the supply of the fluid then being issued, which -enquiry later showed to be different even from that which the Laboratory was supplying in September. At the same time His Honour made arrangements for a resumption of a supply of the old fluid as soon as possible. On the 1st of November orders were issued with the object of withdrawing with as little suspicion as possible all the new fluid which had been issued to districts, leaving the opera- tions to be continued with the existing stock of old fluid as long as it held out. At this very time, however, the use of the new fluid had resulted in a deplorable calamity. On the 30th of October .9 persons were inoculated at Mulkowl in the Gujrt District with the contents of one bottle of the fluid, and all of them contracted tetanus and died. His Honour desires to state here that the people of Mulkowl behaved admirably throughout, and the families of those who suffered were compensated by Government. The Lieutenant-Governor is satis- fied that the tetanus was not due to any carelessness or fault on the part of the inoculating officer, Dr. Elliot, who later was granted a gratuity and permitted to resign his appointment at his own request. The circumstances of the case point to the conclusion that the fluid had been contaminated with tetanus before it reached the Punjab. The Mulkowl disaster was reported on the night of the 6th of November, and in order to guard against the risk of any further calamity Sir Charles Rivaz felt it imperative to issue orders for the immediate and entire cession of all inoculations. Such orders reached the districts concerned on the 7th of November. Many local officers, however, reported that the people were still anxious to be operated upon, and after all the new fluid had  been  withdrawn, on the 19th of November
?13 permission was given for the inoculation of all those who might demand it, pro- vided that old fluid only was used for the purpose. A deputation of Punjab officials visited Bombay and arranged for a resumption of the supply of the old fluid and for its subjection to careful tests in the Laboratory, and when this had been done the public were put in possession of the facts of the case by a communiqu issued on the 30th of November Fresh supplies of fluid began to reach the Punjab again in the beginning of December, but they were not issued for use in the districts until they had been subjected to a separate bacteriological test in this Province. The supplies passed the test satisfactorily and were ready for issue in the beginning of January, when the operations were resumed. From January onwards the Punjab has had a large stock of fluid of approved quality. 26. The number of inoculations performed in connexion with the scheme for extensive inoculations in the districts where most work was done is set forth in the following   statement :-                                          INOCULATIONS PERFORMED IN  September  1902.

Judged by the fact that 200 or more deaths per mensem were reported as due to plague, the epidemic in the districts given in the statement above was considerable from October to June in Ambala, Hoshirpur, Silkot and Gujrnwla, from November to June in Jullundur, Lahore and Amritsar, and also in Ludhina except during January, from December to June in Ferozepore, and from April to June in Gujrt ; the climax occurred in May in Hoshirpur, Ferozepore and Gujrt, and in April in the other districts ; and the epidemic ceased to be severe in all the districts after June. The results achieved establish the correctness of the Lieutenant-Governor's anticipation that the people would be willing to accept inoculation in large numbers well before plague became severe. His Honour has to thank the local officers and Indian gentlemen whose advice and efforts did much to secure the results attained. The manner in which the people   of   certain  districts,    namely   Hoshirpur,   Ambala,    Ferozepore,
14 Jullundur and Amritsar, came forward on the resumption of operations in January affords good reason for believing that if the stoppage had not weakened the con- fidence and strengthened the suspicions of the people and of the officials concerned, and at the same time destroyed the effect produced by the preaching of inoculation and rendered the resumption of preaching difficult, an exceedingly   large  number of persons would have had themselves inoculated.    In several districts   it  is true the people did not  take to  inoculation  and were  afraid   of   it, but these were newly infected districts that had no previous experience of plague or of inoculation. In Gujrt, a newly infected, district, the prospects were promising.    In Gujrnwl also inoculation was newly introduced and was   making  way.    In   most   districts which had before had plague and inoculation  it  was   in   demand, particularly in Ambala, Hoshirpur, Jullundur, Ferozepore and Amritsar.    In other districts the people accepted  it,  though   they   did   not   show   themselves to   be particularly anxious for it, as for instance in Gurdspur, Lahore, Siikot  and   Ludhina.    In all districts however, the people would  have come forward in increasing numbers as the operations continued and   the  total numbers inoculated  would   undoubt- edly have been very large.    The Lieutenant-Governor was   not in a position   to direct  that  inoculation  should  generally   be   pressed   upon   the   people on the resumption of operations, and  the  districts   in  which   most   work   was  done  in January and after were those  in  which   the   local   officers   themselves   took   an interest   in it and   brought   their   personal   influence  to   bear   for   the   purpose of advancing it.    There is no reason to believe that compulsion was used in   any case to secure inoculation, and there can be little doubt  that even after inocula- tions had  been   temporarily   stopped   very large numbers would have  accepted it in all districts if it had been more vigorously advocated.    It   cannot,   however, be   said   whether in  the absence  of   any accident the total   number of inocu- lations   would   have amounted   to   the  number   for   the inoculation   of which arrangements   were   made.    But that   number   was   one   computed mainly for the  purpose   of  estimating   the  cost  of   making   inoculation   available   to  all who might possibly come forward, and even if the operations actually performed had been considerably less,   a  very   valuable   saving  in   life   would  have  been secured, 27. In support of the assertion made at the end of the preceding para- graph a reference may be made to the statements printed on pages 53 and 54 of the Chief Plague Medical Officer's Report for 1902-03. These statements com- pare inoculated and uninoculated persons in respect of their liability to attack by and death from plague. They relate to the epidemic of the year under report in selected villages and in households of which the plague history was ascertained by special enquiry. The selected villages are those in which at least 10 per cent of the population was inoculated and in which there was plague within four months of the inoculation. The figures are compiled from registers and returns especially prescribed for the inocula- tion operations and maintained and verified by the exceptionally strong staff which was on plague duty They cannot, it is true, be regarded as absolute- ly correct, but they were checked as carefully as possible on the spot, and the results deduced from them may be accepted as approximately true. The totals from which these results are deduced are large enough to give trustworthy averages, and it should be noted that in so far as the figures are incorrect they err in favour of the uninoculated. Thus, it is possible that the numbers of the uninoculated who were exposed to plague are exaggerated, for they were calculated by deducting the actual numbers inoculated from the popu- lation according to the Census of 1901, which in many cases was not improbably greater than the population actually in the villages during the outbreak of plague. Moreover, it is probable that more plague occurrences escaped record among the uninoculated than among the inoculated, and there is reason to believe that cases and deaths among inoculated persons were fully brought on to the record. The village totals show that the inoculated had a great advantage over the uninoculated, and the figures compiled from enquiries in particular households which suffered from plague show the same. These latter are particularly valuable for the comparison they afford between the liability  of inoculated  and  uninoculated   persons   when  both   are
15 immediately exposed to infection.    The results of the  two  statements  may be summarised as follows :-    Percentage of population ATTACKED PERCENTAGE OF POPULATION DIED Case Mortality  Uninoculated. Inoculated. Uninoculated. Inoculated. Uninoculated. Inoculated. In infected villages 7.7 1.8 4.7 0.4 60.1 23.9 In infected houses 13.4 8.7 7.4 3.2 55.5 36.3 From the 1st of October 1902 to the 31st of August 1903 the total number of cases and deaths reported in the whole of the Punjab among 481,581 persons who were inoculated in the year was 5,293 and 1,337, giving a case mortality of 25.26 per cent. This is much below the ordinary case mortality of plague, and the low incidence of plague attacks among the inoculated is particularly remarkable in that over 75 per cent. of the inoculations were performed in the case of persons living in actually infected villages. Further evidence in favour of inoculation is afforded by the figures (which can be accepted as correct) showing the case mortality of inoculated persons attacked at different periods after their inoculation. The figures for 1902-03 agree fairly well with those of previous years, and it is established that inoculation gives a protection which increases in amount up to the fourth month after the operation is performed. It has still not been ascertained how long the pro- tection lasts, but it is clear that it lasts more than four months. 28.    The effects of the severe epidemics through   which the  Punjab  has passed   have  not  been   so  immediately   apparent   or disturbing as might have been expected.    But   it  must   not   for  this  reason be supposed that   they   will not  be  very  serious.    Plague operations involve a large recurring expenditure, and plague has already led  to  an   increase   of   crime,  while  trade,   agriculture, education, recruiting and other interests   are   bound   to  suffer  in   the  consider- able  tracts  of country   which   have lately lost a large proportion of their popu- lation.    Large numbers of those who have died have  been   in the prime  of   life, and  the   proportion  of women  who  have died (1,141 and 1,341 per mille males in 1901-02 and 1902-03 respectively) is in excess of the proportion which females bear to males in the population   of   the   Punjab,   which   according   to  the  last Census was 852 females to every 1,000 males.    No forecast can safely be made of the  future course of plague  in  the  Punjab,  but  the  figures for the outbreak of 1903-04 are now mounting up and the Lieutenant-Governor is unable  to   take a  hopeful  view  of the   situation.     The   probability   is   that  the   Province  will continue to suffer severely until the people have made up their minds   that it   is time  for   them to  adopt   the  measures  for  combating  plague, which are well within their power,   and   which   Government   cannot   force   upon  them   against their  will,   though   it  is  always  ready to assist in their enforcement as soon as the people awake to a sense of their importance and necessity.    The Lieutenant- Governor can only trust that the people will endeavour to secure  for  themselves effective  evacuation  and   that they will not neglect the facilities   for inoculation which are now being provided for them.    A large quantity of   approved   fluid   is now   in  stock   and   arrangements have been   made   to   enable inoculation to be performed at all dispensaries in   charge   of   Assistant Surgeons,   as  well  as   to send   out  special  inoculating  officers  to  places where  there    is  a   particular demand. 29. Major Wilkinson, I. M. S., has been in charge of plague operations during the period now under review, and on the 20th of March 1902 he was relieved of his other duties and formally appointed to be Chief Plague Medical Officer. In this position his work has been heavy and responsible, and the Lieutenant-Governor is pleased to acknowledge the  zeal   and  careful  attention
?16 which he has always devoted to it. The reports he has now submitted are a very full record of the subjects with which they are concerned, and, indeed, contain some matter which might with advantage have been omitted. As, however, a separate report on plague will not in future be submitted His Honour thinks it unnecessary now to point out the details in which curtailment would have been desirable. The control of plague operations has recently been made one of the duties of the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, to whom the Chief Plague Medical Officer will be a Personal Assistant, and the history of plague will in future be reported and reviewed with the Annual Report on the Sanitary Ad- ministration of the Punjab.

REPORT ON PLAGUE IN THE PUNJAB FROM OCTOBER 1ST, 1902, TO SEPTEMBER 30TH, 1903, WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO INOCULATION OPERATIONS. INTRODUCTION. Arrangement. 1.    This report deals with the epidemic of plague in the Punjab from   October   1st, 1902, to September  30th,   1903, and special attention  is  given  to the inoculation opera- tions which have been the chief feature of the year. In view of the fact that, except as regards inoculation, the circumstances of the present year do not differ materially from those of the year 1901-02 and that the report on last year's epidemic deals fully with the outbreak in each district and with the measures undertaken for dealing with the same, it will only be necessary to refer briefly to these particulars. In the report for this year a short review of the epidemic, and of the measures taken in connection with it, will first be given, the conditions of each district will then be separately noticed, and attention will be devoted to inoculation in a separate part of this report.
?PART I. Brief review. 2.    Between   October 1st,   1902,  and  September   30th,   1903,   325,747    cases    of plague and 195,141 deaths were reported in British districts of the Punjab. In addition the number of plague cases reported by Native States was 25,051 and of deaths 19,583, bringing the grand totals for the Province as a whole up to 350,798 cases and 214,724 deaths. In Table No. 1 attached are  given the  statistics of  plague  in the Punjab  for  each year from 1897 onwards. It will be seen that while the number of attacks during the present exceeded that of any previous epidemic, the number of deaths was less than that of the year 1901-02, hitherto the worst season. This applies only to the Province as a whole, for it will be seen that the numbers, both of attacks and deaths, in British districts exceed those of any previous epidemic. A portion of the increase in the number of cases reported in British districts is perhaps attributable to the improvement in reporting of plague occurrences during the present season, owing to the supervision that was exercised by the large number of Medical Officers on duty in the Province in connection with the work of inoculation. This remark does not apply, however, to the reporting of deaths, which are believed to have been as correct during the previous as the present season. 3. At the commencement of the season in October 1902 there were 12 districts infected. Of these 12, the Simla District, in which the disease had broken out, at Subathu, towards the end of the previous season, ceased to be infected during October and subsequently remained free. However, two more districts, Karnl and Jhang, became infected during October. Thus in 13 districts the epidemic ran its course from the commencement of the season. These districts were Jullundur, Hoshirpur, Gurdspur, Silkot, Ludhiana, Lahore, Ambala, Ferozepore, Gujrt, Amritsar, Jhang, Gujrnwla and Karnl. In addition to the 14 districts above mentioned, 7 others became infected later in the season, viz., Gurgaon in January, Hissar and Rohtak at the end of February, Montgomery and Shahpur in March, and Jhelum and Rawlpindi during May. While 21 districts were thus actually infected, 4 districts, viz., Kngra, Delhi, Mooltan and Mianwali, reported imported cases which did not give rise to epidemics. The  Native  States   of   Patila,   Kaprthala,  Nbha.,    Kalsia,  Mler   Kotla,  Jnd, Fardkot and Dujna also, suffered from epidemics. The Hissar, Rohtak, Gurgaon, Kngra and Montgomery Districts and the Fardkot and Dujna States reported cases for the first time. The Rawalpindi District may also be included in this category, as with the exception of such as were imported the few cases previously reported had been of a very doubtful nature and the disease had never spread from the villages the places in which it was reported to have occurred. Comparison with previous epidemic. 4.    Compared with the previous season the Karnl,  Hoshirpur,  Jullundur,   Lahore, Amritsar, Gujrnwla, Gujrt, Shahpur and Jhang Districts and the Kaprthala and Jnd States suffered more severely. The greatest increase occurred in the case of the Gujrnwla District in which 70,329 cases with 45,456 deaths occurred as compared with 3,319 cases with 2,244 deaths during the previous epidemic. The Ferozepore  District and the Mler  Kotla State  experienced  epidemics  about equal in severity with those of the previous season. The Ambala,   Ludhiana, Gurdspur and Silkot Districts and the Patila, Nbha and Kalsia States suffered less severely than during 1901-02. The decrease was most marked in the case of the Ludhiana District, in which 8,048 cases with 4,929 deaths were reported as compared with 65,390 cases with 48,028 deaths during the previous season. The  Native  States  of  Bahwalpur and  Nlagarh  which had  suffered   from   an outbreak of plague during  1901-02 escaped entirely during the year under report. A comparison of the map given in this report with that showing the distribution of plague in 1901-02 will show that the area affected by the epidemic has extended both to the north and to the south.
2 5.    Statement No. 6 (in Appendix 1) shows week by week the seizures and deaths in every infected British district in the Province. In all those districts which were extensively infected the epidemic followed a fairly typical course. The rise and fall of the numbers for each individual district; with a few exceptions, were synchronous with the fluctuations of the weekly totals for all the districts combined. The number of plague cases and deaths, although small at the, beginning of October, increased rapidly week by week up. to the week ending December the 20th, when 3,588 cases with 2,235 deaths were recorded. During the following three weeks the numbers slightly decreased, but rose again during the last three weeks of January, 3,693 cases with 2,288 deaths having been returned during the week-ending January; the 31st. There was thus-a lull in the epidemic from December the 14th till January the 31st, a period of seven weeks. In spite of this temporary abate- ment in the number of attacks and deaths, however, the disease continued to spread, and during each. week of this period over 80 villages were added to the:  list of those already infected. From the beginning. of February onwards the epidemic rapidly and uninter- ruptedly increased, reaching its climax in April and not beginning to decline appreciably until towards the middle of May. The highest mortality was reached during the week ending. May 2nd, when 25,592 cases and 15,396 deaths were returned. During. the. seven weeks from March 29th to May 16th, 2,194 villages became. infected and 163,972 cases with 98,077 deaths occurred, these figures being about half those for the whole year. After the middle of May the epidemic rapidly declined until ;during. the week ending August the 15th the number of cases sank to 8 and of deaths to 6, the lowest recorded in any week during the year. From this time onwards the numbers again - gradually though steadily rose until the end of the year under report. In the Gurgaon District the decline began somewhat  earlier than in the other districts,- and the period of seasonal subsidence of plague was, longest in the Ludhina, Gujrt, Jhang and Karnl Districts in which but comparatively small outbreaks had occurred. Attitude of the people towards plague measures. 6.    The bearing of the people in the presence of  the epidemic and their attitude towards measures  for dealing with it varied Attitude of the people towards plague measures. greatly in different parts' of the Province. Generally great apathy was displayed,' especially' by the Muhmmadan' portion of the com- munity. In the Montgomery District, however, where the population have had very little experience of plague, great fright was evinced on its appearance, the people deserting their houses and fleeing to neighbouring villages.  Here as in- most other districts great mistrust of most measures advocated by Government officials was displayed' for some time. Everywhere - the well-to-do. and  educated classes  were the least ready to adopt preventive measures-this being most marked in the larger towns. In some places the attitude of the people greatly improved towards plague measures as they became more familiar with the medical staff. This was markedly so in the Amritsar District where it was reported that an attitude of grave mistrust and suspicion gave place to a real desire to accept the measures offered by Government, as the people became familiar with the staff and their ways. On the whole the attitude of the people was best in those districts which have had the longest experience of the disease. Thus in the Hoshirpur District, which has been infected every year since the epidemic first made its appearance in the Punjab, the attitude of the people was very reasonable, and there was more inoculation and evacuation in this than in any other district. In the Ambala District it is recorded that the attitude of the people was better than in the previous year. 7.    Surveillance over arrivals from infected areas was practically never exercised, nor, Measures taken to   revent infection of healthy places. except in a  very few instances, was   advant- age  taken,   by   the   villagers,  of   the  powers afforded to them of refusing access to their villages to persons coming from infected places. The early detection and segregation-of plague cases appears to have been successful in preventing outbreaks in some places. It , is reported that these measures appear to have averted outbreaks in the towns of Sirsa and Hissar, whereas at Hnsi, in the same district, the concealment of the deaths of two banias, who had returned from a visit to Rewri, resulted in a serious; outbreak. A similar contrast is reported between the circumstances of the town of Jhang and those of Chiniot and Lyallpur. The inhabitants of Jhang-Maghina City were very favourably disposed towards preventive measures and appointed two hakims to visit and report on all suspicious cases of sickness. All cases were reported and promptly dealt with and the disease did not take on an epidemic form. On the other hand, the towns of Chiniot and Lyallpur, the inhabitants of which from the first refused to take any such precautions, suffered from severe outbreaks
3 8.    The arrangements for obtaining information concerning plague occurrences  were then prescribed in the Plague Manual. Owing Arrangements    for obtaining  information regarding to the large number of Medical Officers on duty plague occurrences:                                        in the Province during the season under report, the opportunities for checking returns were greater than during the previous season, though many district reports contain complaints of the defective reporting of plague occurrences and deaths. 9.    Evacuation was not resorted to either as extensively or  as  thoroughly  as  could have been desired Numerous instances are, Evacuation.                                        however, recorded showing that the measure is a practicable one and nearly always beneficial, even where imperfectly carried out. The chief objections urged against evacuation were the danger of theft of property left in evacuated houses and the difficulties of providing sufficient shelter from the cold for the cattle outside the village. In the Jullundur District it is reported that evacuation is better understood and more practised year by year. In the Una Tahsil of the Hoshirpur District every infected village was evacuated more or less thoroughly and in consequence the incidence of the disease was much lessened. It sometimes happened that local conditions existed which more or less favoured evacuation. In the lowlying villages of the Ferozepore District, located along the banks of the Sutlej, evacuation was more readily effected than in other parts of the same district, owing to the circumstances that the villagers are accustomed to being turned out of their houses by' floods and that abundant grass, suitable for the erection of temporary shelters, grows in their immediate vicinity. The segregation of sick  and  contacts  was  but  seldom resorted  to.    In  only   one or two instnces were guards employed to protect property left in evacuated villages. 10.    Medical treatment was fairly   generally accepted wherever facilities existed  for its provision,   and   it  often   proved  a  ready Treatment.                                              means of gaining the confidence of the people. A very considerable amount of treatment was carried out in the Lahore District. 11.    In the British districts a total of 30,717 rooms were disinfected.    Of this number slightly more than half, viz., 15,503, were chemi- cally treated, while the remainder, viz., 15,214, were subjected to desiccation. 12.    Chemical disinfection  was   not  popular.    For  this  reason  it was  never   even attempted in the Amritsar District, a district Chemical disinfection.                     where the attitude of the people towards plague measures in general was by no means unfavourable. Nevertheless the large amount of chemical disinfection done in the Jullundur, Hoshirpur, Gurdspur, Lahore, Jhang and Gurgaon Districts shows that it is possible to induce the people to accept it on a fairly extensive scale. For controlling outbreaks at their commencement the reports for individual districts show that chemical disinfection was invaluable. Because the number of rooms shewn as chemically disinfected in any particular district is small, it should not be concluded that the measure was not of much practical use in that district ; for the numbers, though small, may include instances where an outbreak was controlled in the midst of a very large community. For instance in the Ferozepore District a serious outbreak was probably averted early in the season in the town of Mehrj by the disinfection of a few rooms. 13.    While  chemical  disinfection  found little favour   with the  people, desiccation was a very popular measure, the people Desiccation.                                    understanding the process and having no prejudices against it. It had the advantage that the people could carry it out themselves with but little supervision and that it involved but little trouble. As the process was not extensively tried until late in the season, when the disease shows a marked tendency to   die  out of  itself,   it would be premature to offer any opinion as to its efficacy. In most instances desiccation was carried out with Sawhney's stoves, but other patterns of stoves were also used, and where no stoves were available fires were lighted on the floors of infected rooms. The amount and nature of the fuel used varied in different places, varying quantities of charcoal, wood and cowdung cakes having been employed. Thirty Sawhney's desiccators were purchased in March 1903 for use in the Punjab, and these were disposed of as follows : 3 each to the Gujranwla, Lahore, Amritsar, Jullundur, Hoshirpur, Ferozepore, Ambala and Gurgaon Districts, 2 to the Jhang District, and 1 each to the Ludhina, Gurdaspur, Silkot and Karnl Districts In addition to the above number 10 more desiccators were purchased in June 1903 by the Central Disintection Dept, Jullundur, for issue to districts when necessity may arise.
?4 14.     Ten "Bowman" steam disinfectors, eight of a stationary and two of a portable type, were purchased for use   in   the   Punjab Steam disinfectors.                             during the year   under  report from   Messrs. Richardson and Cruddas   of Bombay.    These were despatched by the above-named firm as follows :- (1)    One to Delhi on 30th September 1902. (2)    One to Mooltan on 27th November 1902. (3)    One to Amritsar on 31st January 1903. (4)    Two to Simla on 4th March 1903, (5)    One to Gurdspur on 5th March 1903. (6)     One to Rwalpindi on 5th March 1903. (7)    One to Ambala on 10th March 1903. (8)    Two portable to Ambala on 15th March 1903. The Delhi machine was transferred to Lahore and the one of Mooltan to Delhi. Two of the 3 machines at Ambala were disposed of as follows :- One each transferred to Jullundur and Lahore. 15.    The   Central   Disinfection Dept,  as   already   reported,   satisfactorily  fulfilled the purpose for which it was established. In Central Disinfection Dept.                                   addition, as will appear later, it proved very useful in connection with inoculation operations. In the subjoined table are shewn abstracts of the transaction   and  of the accounts of the Dept for each quarter of the year under report.

?6 Infection.  16. The commonest history of the infection of a village was that a person had arrived there suffering from plague. The next event was an epidemic among rats, and this within a period varying most commonly between a week and a fortnight was succeeded by an outbreak among human beings. Influence of climatic conditions, soil, &c. 17. The only climatic condition which can be said to have affected the course of the epidemic was the seasonal variation in tem- perature, the effect of which has already been noticed. It may be pointed out that the first lull in the epidemic corresponded with the coldest part of the season, a time during which the people remained most largely indoors. That a lull does occur at this period is therefore an indication that the cold reduces the virulence of the plague bacillus. In this connection it is of interest to note that the epidemic in the Silkot District, which was a much milder one than that of the previous season, appeared to be held in check, till the end of January, by the severity of the winter, which was such that the sugarcane crop was destroyed. Some very interesting investigations were made in the Ambala District with a view to determining the relation of the soil to the incidence of the disease and to the liability to infection and recrudescence. The results tended to show that plague affects villages situated in sandy tracts less than others, but the results must be accepted with reserve, as it is probable that the variation in incidence of the disease is due less to variation in the soils than to variation in density of the population located thereon. It is stated that in the Hoshirpur District the epidemic raged as severely in the hilly part of the district as in the plains. That a certain amount of immunity is conferred on a community by a previous epidemic is indicated by the course of the present epidemic in the Ludhina District. In the Ambala District it was noticed that those parts of the district which had suffered severely during the previous season escaped lightly during the present. Also in the Nawashahr Tahsl of the Jullundur District it was observed that the mortality was distinctly lower than in the more recently infected parts of the district. Plague among rats and other animals.  18. In some districts, in addition to rats, dogs, cats, squirrels and birds also were observed to die during the height of the epi- demic. In some places it was noticed that crows left the neighbourhood of a village when the epidemic was at its height to return again after it had ceased, but no crows were ever observed to die from the disease. Some attempts were made to get rid of rats, but without success. Many Hinds have religious scruples against taking animal life, and these would not consent to any measure involving the destruction of rats. In Amritsar, however, rats were caught and kept in captivity in which they usually soon died, but the measure was not adopted with any vigour and was soon discontinued. When the people had no objection trial was made of various methods for destroying and catching rats. Among them were the placing of a mixture of flour and plaster of Paris near rat-holes, the stuffing of these holes with a mixture of tar and sulphuric acid, and the setting of traps. The mixture of flour and plaster of Paris is said to have been used with success in France, where rats were said to eat it greedily with fatal effect. From experiments made at Jullundur, however, it appeared that rats could survive for more than a week on an exclusive diet of this mixture. The method of stopping rat-holes with a mixture of tar and sulphuric acid is stated to have been effective in Southern India. The method, however, is a very troublesome one , requiring careful supervision ; and the fumes of the mixture are very disagreeable. One form of trap which was found to be useful in the Gurgaon District was a chatty half full of water sunk in the ground to the level of its mouth which was covered over with a very thin layer of dough on which a bait was placed ; when trodden upon by rats the dough was supposed to give way and precipitate the rat into the water. When carefully carried out, the method of catching rats appears to have been effective, but it involves a little trouble, and this the people were not disposed to take. Type of plague. Classes attacked. 19. The bubonic type of plague vastly preponderated, though some cases of the pneumonic and septic forms of plague were observed in most districts. It is reported that in parts of the Shahpur District and in some villages in the Amritsar District outbreaks of
?7 pneumonic plague occurred, and that in the Jhang District the pneumonic type of plague was most common in the cold weather. But little reference is made by District Plague Medical Officers as to variations in the severity of plague during different seasons of the year or at different periods of the epidemic. The District Plague Medical Officer, Jullundur, remarks that the case mortality was lower in the Nawashahr Tahsl than in the more recently infected parts of the district. A mild type of plague is said to have prevailed in the Montgomery District. No villages appear to have been especially liable or immune to attacks of plague. Some District Plague Medical Officers assert that the case mortality was greater among females than males. Persons on plague duty did not appear to be especially liable to attacks of the disease, and only an official-a Hospital Assistant in the Ferozepore District-was attacked ; he recovered. Railway inspection posts. 20. Under the orders of Government railway inspection posts were established from November 1st, 1902, to January 21st, 1903, at Rewri, Rohtak, Sonepat and Ambala in connection with the Coronation Darbr. The railway inspection post at Ghziabad in the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh was also temporarily placed under the control of the Punjab Government. A detailed report on the working of these inspection posts has already been submitted. The subjoined table gives, month by month, the medical staff and their establishment at these posts, together with the number of passengers examined at each, and plague cases and deaths detected.

?9 An inspection post was established at Klka Railway' Station from the 14th of March to 22nd of May 1903 during the move of Government of India and of the Punjab Government to Simla. No plague cases were detected during the period. The medical staff and establishment at this post was as follows :- 1 Inspecting Medical Officer, 1 Nurse, 1 Dhi, 1 Compounder, 1 Clerk. Officers, subordinates and others proceeding to Simla in connection with the move of the Punjab Government were medically examined at the Lahore Railway Station, between May 12th and 18th, 1903. Road inspection posts. 21. Medical inspection of passengers and disinfection of their effects was carried on throughout the year at the Tra Devi and Tattoo Plague Inspection Posts in the Simla District. Two other inspection posts were established in April,-one at Dunera in the Gurdspur District for the protection of Dalhousie, the other at the 17th milestone on the Rwalpindi-Murree Road for the protection of Murree. These remained open during the remainder of the year. All road inspection posts were provided with steam disin- fectors. The strength of the medical staff employed and number of persons inspected, &c., are given in table below :- Table showing the Medical Staff on duty at the undermentioned Road Inspection Posts and the number of persons inspected, &c., during 1902-03.

?14 HISSAR DISTRICT. Epidemic.  24. The Hissar District became infected with plague for the first time in February 1903. The first reported case occurred on the 22nd of February, and altogether 599 cases of plague with 468 deaths were reported. The disease gained a footing in the Hnsi, Fatahabad and Bhiwni Tahsls, whereas the Hissar and Sirsa Tahsls suffered only from imported cases and the disease did not spread in them. The district harboured an enormous number of refugees from Rewri, Ferozepore and Fzilka. Precautionary measures.  At certain railway stations, e.g., Bhiwni, the names and addresses of persons arriving from infected places were recorded, and were sent to the Municipal Committees or Tahsl- drs concerned in order that these persons might be kept under supervision for 10 days. There were 11 cases with 6 deaths in Sirsa Town, but all were cases imported from Fzilka or adjoining places in the Ferozepore District. Almost all of them were detected at the railway station. All the cases were promptly dealt with and treated in the camp, The town of Bhiwni afforded shelter to about 3,000 refugees from the plague-stricken town of Rewri, but notwithstanding this, thanks to the stringent precautions taken by the Municipality, no indigenous outbreak occurred until the 26th of March. In the Fatahabad Tahsl there were 10 villages in which imported cases occurred, but in only 1 of these did the disease spread. In the remaining 9 the cases were promptly reported and efficiently dealt with. In the tenth village, Tohna, the people refused to accept segregation, and 19 cases with 13 deaths followed. But for the stringent precautions adopted there is no doubt that the disease would have gained a footing earlier and given rise to a severer epidemic. At many villages persons arriving from infected areas were kept in quarantine for 10 days. Information.  Returns were submitted by Patwrs and Municipalities and were checked by the Assistant Surgeon on plague duty. It is believed that the returns were accurate. Disinfection.  Disinfection by chemicals was done only in houses where evacuation was thoroughly carried out, in all cases with satisfactory results. Infection.  The infection first of the district, and afterwards of its towns and villages, was due to human agency. From Hnsi Tahsl two banis visited Rewri to buy grain which, owing to plague there, had fallen in price, and when they returned to their village, Jamlpur, they both died of plague, and their deaths being concealed an epidemic resulted. Mortality among rats. In all cases where rat mortality was observed it followed the appearance of the disease among human beings by a few days. In no instance did mortality amongst rats precede the appearance of the disease among human beings. Type. The bubonic type of plague prevailed. The disease was of a severe type. None of the few pneumonic and septicmic cases observed recovered. Staff and Establishment. The District Medical Officers and subordinates concerned performed plague duty in addition to their ordinary work, but for a short  period, from 29th March to May 16th, 1903, Assistant Surgeon Hari Ll Basu was transferred from Lahore District. ROHTAK DISTRICT. Epidemic. 25. The outbreak of plague which occurred in the Rohtak District during the year under report marked the first appearance of the  disease in the district. Plague was introduced from adjacent infected villages in the Gurgaon District, and 292 cases with 220 deaths were reported. The presence of plague was concealed by the people who were hostile to any official interference. With the exception of the exercise of the surveillance on arrivals from infected places in certain towns and, in the case of a few villages, of the right to a free access to persons coming from infected places, practically no precautionary measures were taken. No special medical staff was deputed to this district.
?15 GURGAON DISTRICT. Epidemic 26.    The Gurgaon District became infected with plague for the first time during the year under report. The epidemic broke out in Rewri Town in January and was confined to the  Rewri Tahsl.    Infection  was  probably brought from Meerut or Ferozepore by persons who fled from those places and took refuge in Rewri: 4,371 cases of plague with 3,700 deaths were reported. There can be scarcely any doubt that the disease was for some time prevalent in Rewri before it was brought to notice. A plague inspection post was established here in November 1902 and several cases of plague were removed from trains coming from Ferozepore. Attitude of the people. Plague measures were strongly opposed and many attributed the spread of plague to the disinfection of houses. As long as the death-rate remained low the people did not take to flight, but when whole families began to be swept away, a general panic ensued, and by the first week in April the town took on quite a deserted look. Most of the shops were closed, supplies became scarce, and it was estimated that only about one-third of the original population remained in the town. In many instances the dead were forsaken and great difficulty was experienced in disposing of corpses. From the town the disease spread to 60 villages of the tahsl and the epidemic reached its height during the week ending the 28th of March. In this week 596 cases with 496 deaths were returned. Throughout the epidemic there was extensive concealment of cases which did not terminate fatally. Preventive measures. Surveillance  over  arrivals   from  infected areas  was exercised only at the  town of Farrukhabad, and the power of refusing access to villages to persons from infected places was availed of in but few instances and in only a half-hearted way. Information. Information of plague occurrence in villages was obtained from returns  submitted  by Patwrs in accordance with the rules. In the Information.  town of Rewri the cases and deaths were reported to a special Nib Tahsildr through the agency of a special committee. A check on the number of deaths in Rewri was maintained by placing a Muharrir at every exit from the town to register the number of corpses carried to the burning ghts or burial-grounds. As above indicated, the returns were not very reliable. Evacuation. By the time plague was declared in Rewri the disease had got such a firm hold of the place that evacuation was out of the question. Only five villages resorted to evacuation, and in only one of them was it thoroughly carried out and followed up with disinfection and desiccation. These measures were thoroughly and systematically carried out at Dharuhera. The population of this village was 2,152 and it had only 13 cases. The infected portions of the population camped out quite apart from the uninfected. The people themselves made their own arrangements for guarding the village at night, and no attempts at robbery were made. The behaviour of the people of this village was mainly due to the action of the Zaildr, who was also the proprietor of the village ; he not only supplied hutting material to those who could not afford it, but insisted on having every house in the village desiccated before the people returned to it. Fuel for desiccation was also supplied by him. No cases occurred after the return of the people to their houses. Nowhere else was there any segregation, and in Rewri Town only   destitute cases were brought to the special plague hospital. Disinfection. One thousand eight hundred and forty-seven rooms  were   chemically  disinfected. At first disinfection was opposed, but later on the people applied for it. The people objected to disinfection until a period of 11 days in the case of a Hindu and 1 of 3 days in the case of a Muhammadan had elapsed since the occurrence of a death. No instances of plague occurring in houses after disinfection were brought to notice. The Hind?s strongly objected to the green colour of the mercury solution, as they said it was the favourite Muhammadan colour. The people were averse to the disinfection of household effects and in very few instances did they allow it to be done. The attitude of the people towards desiccation was certainly favourable, and it was hoped that the people would themselves supply the fuel, but in very few instances did they help  in  this  way  in  the  town.    Charcoal and wood were invariably   utilised  and   20  to
16 30 seers proved sufficient for an ordinary-sized room; for small rooms 15 seers were sufficient. The temperatures were not recorded, but vermin of all descriptions were found dead on the floors of the rooms after the operation. The fuel was always allowed to burn completely out before the stove was removed. More time was required to desiccate a house than to disinfect it by chemical means. The cost was certainly less, but the difference was not great. Excluding labour the cost of desiccating a room of average size was Re. 0-10-6 against Re. 0-12-9 for chemical disinfection; 567 rooms were desiccated. Infection. Mr. Charters, the District Plague Medical Officer, remarks that the human agency always seems to have been the chief factor in the conveyance of infection from one place to  another and in the dissemination in infected places by means of contact. In only one instance was it brought to light that rats were dying in a place prior to the outbreak of plague, and this was at the village of Hussainpur, two miles from Rewri Town, which was infected much later than many villages further away from the town. In Rewri Town and elsewhere in the tahsl rat mortality was observed to follow some time after the outbreak of the disease among human beings. Dead rats were invariably found in infected houses, and in many instances in the beds of plague cases. Although the part played by rats was impressed upon the people, they made but little attempt to destroy these animals. Monkeys, dogs, jackals and cats were also found dead round about Rewri. Vultures were found dead near a few plague-stricken villages, and this was put down to their having fed on the bodies of cases which had been imperfectly buried and subsequently unearthed by jackals.    No attempts were ever made to destroy rats. Type. The bubonic type of the disease was the  most prevalent.    Hindus, Banis, Mahjans and   metal   workers   suffered   the  most.    In Rewri Town   according  to  the  returns  the incidence was greater among men than women, but this may have been due to the concealment of female cases. In addition to the Civil Surgeon and his subordinates and Assistant Surgeon a Hospital Assistant was sent to the district for plague duty. DELHI DISTRICT. 27. There was no epidemic in this district, but 10 cases of plague were imported into Delhi City, all of whom were suffering from the disease on their arrivals. They were treated in their own houses which were chemically disinfected and the disease did not spread. All cases were reported by the members of the Municipality representing the wards in which they occurred. There being only imported plague cases in the Delhi Town, no special Medical Staff was detailed for plague duty, which was performed by the District Medical Staff con- cerned in addition to  their  own. A few cases suspected to be plague occurred in the camps of the Coronation Darbr. KARNAL DISTRICT. Epidemic.  28.    The  epidemic under report is the second  that has visited the Karnl District : 2,457 plague cases occurred with 1,701 deaths, as compared with 566 cases and 333 deaths recorded in 1901-02. The epidemic grew very slowly and reached its climax in the third week in April, after which it rapidly declined. Preventive measures.                             No efforts whatsoever were ever taken by the inhabitants of the  district to  prevent plague   from   coming   into   their   towns  and villages,   nor   were   persons   coming  from an infected area ever refused access to a village. Returns of plague occurrences were obtained in towns from Municipal Muharrirs and in the villages from the Patwris in accordance with the regulation : the returns of Patwris were not very reliable. Evacuation.  One village, Tikri, was completely  evacuated,   in   another village  evacuation  was checked by the theft of cattle. Segregation. Neither sick  nor  their  contacts were ever segregated, and medical treatment was never applied for. Disinfection.   Chemical  disinfection  was  not popular,  and only  983 rooms were chemically dis- infected, most of which were in the village of Tikri  mentioned above, which was completely disinfected. Phenyle was used for disinfecting personal  effects, but  it  was never  used
17 thoroughly.   The people objected to desiocation as they had to provide their own fuel   and only 10 rooms  were   desiccated.    The cost of desiccating a room is stated as eight annas. Infection.  Infection was due in most cases  to  human  agency.    The   District  Plague   Medical Officer   states that  infection   was   most   com- monly  carried   from  one  village  to    another, by persons incubating  plague, but the disease was also conveyed by infected clothing. Once introduced, plague was carried from one part of a  village to another  by  rats which were often observed to die in houses before human beings were attacked. No measures were taken for the destruction of rats. Type.                                                                   The prevalent type of plague was bubonic, and   only a fewer septic  and pneumonic cases were observed. Medical Staff.                         The special Medical Staff on plague   duty  in  the district consisted  of one Assistant Surgeon, one Hospital Assistant and one   Com- pounder. AMBALA DISTRICT.  Epidemic.                                 29.    The third epidemic which has visited the Ambala District was much less severe than that of the previous year, for while in that   year   29.752  plague   cases  with   22,762 deaths were  reported,   only   8,988  cases with 6,318 deaths were returned during the year under report. . The epidemic increased steadily from its commencement up till the week ending December the 20th, from which time until the end of January it remained almost stationary. During February and March plague increased rapidly and the epidemic reached its climax during April. It had almost died out during August and the first half of September, but reappeared during the latter half of this month. The bearing of the people towards the epidemic was one of apathy, and they availed themselves little of measures for combating the spread of plague. Precautionary measures.                   There was  practically no surveillance  over arrivals from infected areas exercised in any part of the district. If villages were very badly infected the inhabitants of other villages did at times prevent persons coming from them entering their own village, but this was the exception rather than the rule. On the whole, however, the villagers were careful to avoid very badly infected places. Evacuation.                          Evacuation was never adopted except in a very half-hearted and useless way    which had no effect whatever on the progress of the disease. If the first to be attacked with the disease happened to be very low-caste people, the Lambardrs did occasionally turn them out of the villages. But in the case of any other class of persons this was never done. Treatment                                           Medical  treatment  was  very  popular   and  was very generally accepted.    A special dispensary was started in Ambala and from it some 300 cases were treated with very grati- fying results. Disinfection.                                    Only two rooms are  reported to  have  been   chemically disinfected and the measure was most unpopular and in the absence of thorough   evacuation   was   never   attempted : 441 rooms were desiccated with Sawhney's stove,   but  the  method was adopted   too  late in the season to permit of an estimation being made of its efficacy. Infection.                          The disease was disseminated by human agency, both direct and by infected clothing- Several instances were observed where thieves' who had stolen infected clothing and taken it away to their own villages, died there of the disease, and the District Plague Medical Officer records an instance in which some people maliciously threw a bag containing dead rats into an old woman's house at Jagdhri She opened the bag and when she saw what was in it threw it and its contents away. She, however, developed plague and died 7 days later. In some cases the dissemination of the disease was ascribed to ns who visit two or three villages Several villages, where rat mortality was very high in the preceding season, escaped lightly or were free during the present one. Rupar Town was an example of this. In the previous epidemic rat mortality had been so great that rats were very rare in the town during the earlier months of the present epidemic and plague did not reappear in the town until May 1903. Influence of soil, &c.               It was observed that, both in tahsls and in individual villages, those which   had had a severe visitation during the previous epidemic escaped lightly   during  the  present one.    The area of  maximum incidence of the disease also showed, when compared with the   previous year, a distinct tendency to travel from north to south.
?18 Some interesting observations were made by Dr E. Houseman, District Plague Medical Officer, concerning the influence of the soil upon outbreaks of plague. His general conclusions are that, while the soil has but little effect upon the course of an outbreak of plague, once the disease has been introduced into a town or village, places situated upon certain soils are less liable than others to outbreaks of plague, due either to the introduction of infection or to recrudescence. Dr. Houseman's figures tend to show that villages on a rich alluvial soil are both more liable to primary infection and to recrudescence than villages built on poorer and more sandy spills. The case of recrudescence is very marked. He also adduces from his figures that villages on a rich soil with natural irrigation enjoy high degree of immunity. It should be remarked, however, that the evidence that the nature of the soil is responsible for the differences noted is one that cannot be accepted  without fuller enquiry. Plague among rats and other animals;                   At the end of the previous plague season it had been observed that rats had almost dis- appeared, but by the beginning of November they had again made their appearance. There was much mortality among them this year also. It was generally observed that people developed plague from 3 to 7 days after the death of rats in their houses. It was noticed in several villages that mortality among rats was not followed by outbreak of plague among. human beings. This was supposed to be due to the more cautious way in which the villagers handled them, as such a thing had never been observed during the previous epidemic. Type. The   bubonic   type   of the disease- prevailed, and, though the pneumonic form was largely reported, it was suspected from the low case mortality returned that simple pneu- monia was largely confounded with it. In the Kharar Tahsil 6 cases were observed in which there was profuse diarrhoea with bloody stools, associated with collapse and death within 48 hours. Medical Staff and Establishment.                            The  following  Medical   Officers  and subordinates were employed  on plague duty in the district : - Captain J. Stephenson, I. M. S , District Plague Medical Officer, Dr. E. Houseman, Dr. G. Taylor, Dr H. Fraser, and Dr. J. S. C. Elkington, Inoculating Medical Officers, Assistant Surgeon S. N Mozamdar, Assistant Surgeon Jugal Kishore, two Hospital Assistants,   and 6 Compounders. SIMLA DISTRICT. 30.    This district did not suffer from an epidemic, but at the commencement  of  the season there were 9 cases and 9 deaths in the Epidemic.                      Subathu   Cantonment,   which   were   the    last cases of an outbreak which had occurred at the end   of  the previous   season.    During   that- outbreak there had been 66 cases and 45 deaths recorded. The outbreak ceased during October of the present season. Three imported cases of plague occurred in Simla itself during the year under report, 2 of which came to the Ripon Hospital for treatment. All cases were segregated, the infected houses chemically disinfected, and the personal effects of the patients disinfected in a steam disinfector. The same precautionary measures as were described in last year's report continue to be maintained.    A Bowman steam disinfector was erected in the bazar. The Medical staff on plague  duty  was as  follows :-Captain E. L. Perry, I  M  S., District  Plague   Medical   Officer,   Dr.   C.   V. Medical Staff and Establishment.                        Naidu, Assistant Surgeon Jagan Nath, Assist- ant Surgeon Moti Ram, 5 Hospital  Assistants and 2 Dhas. KANGRA DISTRICT. 31. The only outbreak of plague in th Kngra District was at the municipal town of Nurpur, where 16 indigenous cases with 12 deaths occurred. The first case was a child 2 years old who was seen on the 14th February in the convalescent stage. Her infection was attributed to the visit of some relatives who had come from an infected' village in the Pathankot Tahsl on February 9th. All the cases were isolated and the houses in which they occurred chemically disin- fected. Rats.  There were reports from some   of the  villages in the   Hamirpur  and Nrpur Tahsls of slight mortality amongst rats, but this was not followed by any outbreak of plague among, human beings. No special Medical staff was sent to this district.
?19 HOSHIARPUR District. Epidemic: 32.    The year under report is the sixth that plague had visited the  distict,   and the present epidemic was more severe than any of its predecessors: 35,522 cases with 19,355 deaths were returned during the present epidemic as compared with 22,437 cases with 12,500 deaths recorded during 1901- 02. At the commencement of the season 22 villages were already infected. The epidemic rapidly grew until the week ending December the 20th, when there was a very distinct subsidence, which lasted till the end of January. At the beginning of February the disease again spread rapidly, and the rise continued until May 30th. The disease was at its height during a period of eight weeks from March the 29th to May the 23rd. Thence onwards it rapidly declined, disappearing during the second week in August; to reappear during the third week in- September. The people were very fairly disposed towards all plague measures and more inocu- lation was done in this than in any other district. Where the disease was a new experience, as in the Una Tahsl, the people often exhibited great fright at its presence, so- much so that corpses were deserted and great difficulty was sometimes experienced in getting them dispos- ed of. In the Una Tahsl more evacuation was done than in any other tahsl; in the other tahsls plague had come to be regarded by the people with more or less indifference. Measures adopted. Surveillance over arrivals from   infected   areas   was   never exercised.    In no case did the villagers  avail themselves  of the facilities, afforded to them by   Government,   to prevent persons from infected places entering their villages. Information. The reporting of plague occurrences was fairly well carried out by Patwr's:- Conceal- ment of cases was usually limited to the earl} stages of outbreaks of plague: Evacuation. Evacuation, more or less imperfect, was so extensively resorted to as to exert a most appreciable effect on the progress of the epi- demic. In the Una Tahsil every infected village was evacuated to some extent The largest villages were the tardiest to evacuate. In the Garhshankar and Hoshiarpur Tahs Is evacuation was less resorted to than in other parts of the district. Very often the people only moved out into their cattle-sheds adjoining their houses. The inconvenience of removing necessaries out into camp, the difficulty of building huts for themselves, and of providing suitable shelter for their cattle, as well as the ever present risk of theft from the evacuated houses, all combined to make the people disinclined to evacuate their houses. Even when the villages were completely evacuated, if a few days went by without the occurrence of a case of plague, the people returned to their houses, often only to experience a fresh outbreak of plague. Segregation. Segregation was   never properly   practised,   though   occasionally an   infected family was put into a cattle-shed on  the   outskirts of the village. Disinfection. The District Plague Medical Officer remarks that disinfection by chemicals is   never likely to become popular, as the people object to their houses   being, upset  and  overrun   by a lot of coolies: 2,221 rooms were disinfected chemically. Of 844 villages infected in the whole district in not more than half a dozen was any disinfection done, as there was no demand for it. During the latter part of the epidemic desiccation by Sawhney's stoves was intro- duced ; 117 rooms were desiccated ; and the measure promised to become far more popular than chemical disinfection, as the people do not have to move everything out of their houses, it was found that with 16 seers of wood, or 18 seers of cowdung cakes, the necessay temperature was reached within an hour. Infection; The infection of villages when it- could  be traced was almost always found to be due to human agency. Grain or other articles of merchandise were never known to be the means of conveying infection. Rats. In many villages the  outbreak  of  plague among  human  beings  followed   mortality amongst  rats  after  a lapse of about ten days. At the   beginning   of  an   epidemic rats   were frequently found dead in the fields adjacent to the infected village and during the epidemic they disappeared from every house in the village. When the epidemic was at an end they were observed to again make their appearance in the villagers' houses. No steps were taken, by the villagers to destroy rats, but it was observed that the keeping of cats is becoming more- common in villages in the district. Some experiments were made by officers on plague duty with tar and sulphuric acid for destroying rats. The experiments were, however, not successful. In addition to rats other animals stated by the villagers to have been attacked with plague were buffaloes, oxen, goats, cats and dags.
20 Type. Bubonic plague was twice as common as  septic and  pneumonic combined and septic far more common than pneumonic. Hot dry weather seemed to be the only factor which affected the progress of the epidemic. Soil appeared to have nothing to do with it, as it raged as fiercely in the hills as in the plains, and in the plains it prevailed equally in the dry and the marshy tracts. The poorer classes suffered most from plague, though the mortality among high caste Hindus was very high. The case mortality was highest among Muhammadan females. Medical Staff and Establishment, The Medical  staff on   plague duty in the district was as follows :-Captain M. Corry, I. M. S., District Plague Medical Officer, Dr. D. V. M   Adams, Dr. W    Burns,   Dr.   R. Michell, Dr J. H. Rankin  and Dr. C. E  P. Forsyth,. Inoculating Medical Officers, Assistant Surgeon Uttam Chand, I Hospital Assistant and 9 Compounders. Jullundur District. Epidemic. Brief review of the epidemic. 33    The Jullundur District has been infected with plague every year since 1897.   The present epidemic was a severe one,   more   so than    that   of    the    previous    season,    there having been 714 villages and towns infected with. 46,463 cases and 25,229 deaths during the present season as against 673 villages and towns with 32,873 cases and 18,959 deaths during the previous one, The epidemic grew steadily from its commencement till the week ending December the 20th, after which there was a slight fall in the numbers till the last week in January, from which time onwards the figures again rose, a marked rise occur- ring in the middle of February. The rise continued till the climax was reached between April the 5th and May the 9th. From this date the epidemic rapidly declined till it disap- peared during the last week in July. Attitude of the people. The attitude  of  the  people  towards  plague  measures  varied   greatly  in  different villages. In villages which had in former years suffered severely preventive measures were more or less practised at the beginning of the season Some communities seemed to be content to suffer severely year by year without doing anything to help themselves ; others began to take precautions, and some asked for help even before their village was infected. Between these two extremes there were all gradations, but unfortunately the apathetic communities were in the majority. Preventive measures. No attempt was made by the people  to avoid  communication   with  infected places, and an instance occurred where the people, having agreed that it was advisable to avoid a certain infected village, immediately afterwards attended a mela there to witness wrestling matches. Persons would crowd round the sick beds of plague cases utterly regardless alike of the danger involved and of the advice tendered to them. Evacuation. Evacuation is better understood and more practised year by year. In the neighbour- hood of all large towns may be seen houses which have been built by well-to-do persons who take refuge in them when plague breaks out in their midst. In villages which had in former years experienced epidemics evacuation was to, some extent practised at the beginning of the season and before many cases had occurred in them. Many people erected shelters on the roofs of their houses and lived there, while others lived at their wells. In most instances people did not evacuate until plague had taken a firm hold of their village, and this was the case with some villages which had had bitter experience of plague year after year. In the month of March and thereafter many people evacuated their houses, being stimulated thereto by the severity of the plague and while the onset of the warm weather made evacuation less difficult.    Only five villages were completely evacuated and disinfected. Information. The returns sent in by Patwrs were often very inaccurate, though they were checked as much as possible by officers whenever   they visited the villages. Disinfection. More chemical disinfection was done  in  the  Jullundur than  in  any  other   district, 3,379 rooms having been so treated. These rooms were chiefly in the larger towns, and plague was held in check to some extent in these towns by the measure. Except in five villages which were completely evacuated, very little chemical disinfection was done in, villages. 29 rooms were desiccated for experimental purposes ; the results, however, were not satislactory, and the experiments were discontinued, Infection. In the majority of cases enquired   into it  was  found that  fresh infection  was  due to human communication, though, according to the statements given in many instances, rats died before plague became general. The first human case had often come from an infected village, apparently incubating plague.    Infection through contaminated clothing was  clearly made-
?21 out at Dandwl. Clothes were brought to a house in this village from Shahkot in the cold weather of 1901-02. In November  1903 the clothes were taken out of the cupboard in which they had been lying. Rats died in the house shortly afterwards, and about five days the first case among human beings in the village occurred in this house. Several clear cases of double infection were  made  out.    Outbreaks  were  in  many instances attributed to recrudescence, but it was very difficult to prove such an origin. Mortality of rats was very common throughout the Jullundur District, and, as has been seen, it frequently preceded outbreaks of plague in villages. The people were instructed to burn dead rats whenever found, but this was very seldom done. The finder of a dead rat usually threw it into the street or on to the roof of his neighbour's house, whence it was taken away by kites or crows to form a fresh focus of infection. None of the methods of des- troying rats by traps or poisons gave any hope of success. Experiments showed that even when fed exclusively on the mixture of plaster of Paris and "ata " rats lived from varying periods up to about a week. Poisoning by a mixture of tar and sulphuric acid was not a success. It was impos- sible to find all the rat holes, and the rats instinctively avoided coming in contact with the mixture.    The mixture, moreover, was difficult and dangerous to handle. Destruction by traps was tried in Jullundur Cantonment, but without success. Destruction by drowning the rats in a sunken chatti covered with dough was tried extensively. It is sometimes practised in this district for the purpose of destroying field mice. The method was successful to a slight extent when an officer was present to see it carried out, but otherwise it was not tried. The bubonic type of plague prevailed : it is mentioned that a good many fulminant pneu- monic cases were seen. The mortality in the Nawashahr Tahsl was lower than in the more recently affected parts of the district Most of the villages in this tahsl had suffered from annual epidemics of plague, and in recent years the population has been inoculated and in many cases re-inocu- lated. The following Medical Officers  and  subordinates   were  employed   on  plague  duty in the district :-Captain W. E. Scott-Moncrieff, Medical Staff and Establishment.              M.   S.,   District   Plague   Medical   Officer, Dr. F.L. Dickson, Dr. J. W. Miller, Dr. B. M. Bond, Dr. J. F. Northcot, Dr. R.  W. Gray, Inoculating  Medical Officers, Dr. Karm Singh, 6 Hospital Assistants, 8  Compounders and 1 Dhi, LUDHIANA DISTRICT. 34.    This was the third year in which the Ludhina District had been infected.    The present epidemic was much less severe than the Epidemic.                                              previous one ; for, while in the previous year there had been 65,390 cases with 48,028 deaths, during the  present season only 8,048 cases with 4,929 deaths were recorded. Ten villages were infected at the beginning of October, and the epidemic steadily grew until the middle of December, from which time until the middle of February it remained almost stationary. The epidemic then increased again, and was most severe during April and May. The disease then rapidly declined and disappeared in the last week of July, only however to reappear during the last week of August. With the exception of inoculation practically nothing was  done   in   this   district  to combat   the   epidemic.    No   surveillance  was Preventive measures.                        exercised over  arrivals  from  infected   places, and the villagers never refused access to such persons. Occasionally the Hinds would evacuate in a partial fashion, but the Muhammadans never did so. Chemical disinfection was never done, and only a trifling amount of desiccation was attempted. The results of desic- cation were not observed. Information. The prescribed returns were submitted  by Patwrs  and  were  checked  whenever villages were visited.
?22 Infection was chiefly due to human agency, though rats were observed to  die  before the epidemic broke out among people in almost every village that became infected. The period which elapsed between the mortality amongst rats and the appearance of the disease amongst human beings varied from 1 to 7 days. Some attempts were made to destroy rats, but without any success. The bubonic form prevailed, and the septic form was apparently not recognised.   The District Plague Medical  Officer remarks  that, although many cases of pneumonic plague were reported, it is most probable that cases of ordinary pneumonia were included as the case mortality was much lower than that usually observed with pneumonic plague. The case mortality was highest during April. The following Medical Officers  and subordinates  were employed on plague duty in the district :-Captain G. Browse, I. M. S., Dis- Medical Staff and Establishment.             trict Plague MedicaOfficer, Dr. R. W.  Fisher, Dr. P. E. Dobbs, Dr. F.Robinson, Inoculating Medical Officers, Assistant Surgeon Moti Rm, 1 Hospital Assistant and 5 Compounders. FEROZEPORE DISTRICT. 35.    The year under report was the third in which the Ferozepore District had been infected with plague, and the second in which Epidemic.                                                     it suffered seriously. The figures for the present very slightly exceeded those of the previous year, and the difference may have been due to better reporting, the returns having been more extensively checked during the present than during the last season. There were 11,394 cases with 7,895 deaths during the present year as against 10,307 cases with 6,342 deaths in the preceding epidemic. One town and one village in the Zra Tahsl and one village in the Moga Tahsl were infected at the commence- ment of the season. The epidemic gradually grew till the end of December ; there was a slight lull in January, after which the disease increased steadily ; the epidemic reaching its climax between May the 3rd and May the 16th. The weekly figures do not give a very reliable indication of the growth of the epidemic, as frequently a large number of cases which had been previously concealed had to be included in the weekly returns. The people of the district themselves were aware of the lull in the epidemic which occurred during January and often remarked upon it. It was probably more marked than the figures show. Reporting was worst in the Ferozepore Tahsl, and a great deal of con- cealment was suspected both in the Ferozepore City and Cantonment. A great many persons fled from both places early in the epidemic, and it was remarked that at a time when the Ferozepore City was returning no cases the surrounding villages in many instances ascribed their infection to it. The attitude of the people of the Moga Tahsl, who had had a large previous ex- perience of plague and of Government measures, Attitude.                                                                was most encouraging. The population of the Zra Tahsl were less ready to adopt any preventive measures, and the attitude of the inhabitants of the Ferozepore Tahsl is described as one of hopeless apathy. No surveillance over arrivals from infected areas  was ever  exercised,   nor   did   the villagers  avail   themselves   of  the   power  of Preventive measures.   refusing access to persons from infected places. The communication between infected and uninfected places was very free. Returns were sent in by the Patwrs in accordance with the instructions contained in the Plague Manual, but were most imperfect. Information.                                    They were, however, extensively checked by officers whenever they visited a village. Evacuation of villages was frequently resorted  to  in  the  neighbourhood   of  Moga, Zra, Makhu, and along the bank of the Sutlej. Evacuation.                       Around Zra and at some of the villages near Makhu even the Mussalmns, usually the most obstinate class of the community, turned out with the exception of their Kzs. Evacuation, though never complete, was such as to do some obvious good. Segregation of sick and contacts was carried out at Zra Town, Mehrj Town, and at two villages in the Moga Tahsl. In Zra Town the disease had already spread further than the small area of the town treated, but in the other cases the measure, which was combined with thorough disinfection of the infected quarters., was successful in com- pletely stopping the outbreak.
?23 Segregation of sick was very rarely resorted to, but at Jatnwla,  a village  in  the Zr  Tahsl, all  the sick  and  contacts  were segregated near their wells.    On being asked why they had done this, the   people  replied that  they  had been  advised,   by  a Mussal- man fakir,   that it was the best thing to do, and had acted at once on his advice. Medical treatment was in great favour, and it did   much  to  ingratiate  the  medical staff with the people and to  remove  the  dis- Treatment.                                                trust of the latter towards plague measures. Sixty-one  rooms were   chemically   disin- Disifection.                  fected and 3,577 desiccated. Desiccation was very popular, but the people, when the process was first introduced, used to insist on removing as much as possible from the rooms beforehand. Almost invariably a place became infected by a  person  arriving  in  the  incubation stage of plague and developing the disease after Infection.                                               arrival. The dissemination of the disease through a village appeared often to be due to the agency of rats. The death of rats some- times followed and at other times preceded the outbreak of the disease among human beings. No measures were taken to destroy rats, and the people would not interest them- selves in the matter. The bubonic form of plague vastly preponderated.    The septicmic form was much spoken of by the people, but was seldom seen. Type of the disease.Most of the cases when of two or   three  days' duration showed a bubo on examination,    Some pneumonic plague was seen.    One Hospital Assistant, on plague duty, developed the disease, but recovered. The following Medical  Officers  and establishment were  employed on  plague   duty in the district :-Captain E. L. Perry, I. M. S., Medical Staff and Establishment.                                  and Captain R. G. Turner, I. M. S., District Plague Medical Officers, Dr. F. J. Pearson, Dr. W. Somerville, Dr. C H. Mahoney, Inoculating Medical Officers, Dr. G. H. Key, i Hospital Assistant and 4 Compounders. SIALKOT DISTRICT. 36.    This was the third season during which an epidemic of plague had visited the Silkot District, but the present one was not as Epidemic.                                                     severe as that of the previous season, there having been 22,697 cases with 14,355 deaths in this epidmic as against 51,914 cases and 34,137 deaths during the preceding one. Three out of the five tahsils in the district were infected at the commencement of the season, and the other two became so subsequently. The epidemic grew steadily from the beginning of October up to the wreek ending the 20th of December, from which time till the end of January there was a diminution in the spread of plague, followed by another rise in February, most marked at the middle of the month. The .'numbers then steadily grew until the climax was reached about the end of April. The epidemic rapidly declined early in May and disappeared in the first week of August, to reappear at the end of September. In some of the small Municipal towns committees were formed with a view to pre- venting trade and communication with infected Preventive measures.                          places. At only one place, however, viz., Nrowl, was any attempt made to prevent a person from an infected area entering, and in that particular case the man kept out was paid by the Reverend G. H. Gough, Vice-Presi- dent of the Municipality.    Otherwise the measure was not adopted. At several villages all sick and contacts were segregated on  the appearance   of  the disease, with the  result  that   outbreaks  were Segregation.                 averted. Evacuation  was  not    adopted  anywhere in the district. The returns submitted by Patwrs  were very accurate,  and the Tahsxldrs kept  a good check on them. They were also checked Information.                                         whenever a Medical Officer visited one of the villages. No chemical   disinfection   was done  in  the   Silkot District,   but 431  rooms   were desiccated  with  Sawnhey's   stove,   and   the Disinfection.                                               measure   was   popular,  the  people  providing Desiccation                                                                  their own fuel, which was co wdung mixed with a small quantity of wood.    About 15 seers of wood and cowdung were used for  an  average
?24 sized room. It was found out of the question to desiccate a room that was as much as 20 X 20 feet. In small rooms temperatures varying from 150 to 200 Fahr. were reached on the walls and floors. Difficulty was experienced in moving the machine from one room to another. Of 63 villages in which special enquiries were made, in 47 the  infection  was  traced to importation by human agency. In 7 villages Infection.                                          outbreaks were apparently a recrudescence of the previous epidemic, and in g the inhabitants put it down to rats, which were said to have died before any human beings. Dr. Jones, the District Plague Medical Officer, remarks, however, that the more the latter class of cases were enquired into, the more doubtful they became, as it was almost always found that there had been communication with infected places or that the place had been infected during the preceding season. The effect of climate upon the  epidemic  has  already  been incidentally   mentioned. The Plague Medical Officer considers that Influence of climate, &c.                       the extreme cold of January   may  have  done much to check the course of the disease.    The weather, he remarks, was so cold during  the month that nearly all the sugarcane crop was destroyed. Excessive mortality among rats was observed throughout the infected area. No rela- tion, however, was noticed between the extent of Rats and other animals.                mortality among rats and the severity of plague outbreaks in villages.    In places where the disease was very  severe,   cattle,   dogs, squirrels and sparrows were sometimes observed to die. No attempts were ever  made  to  destroy rats,  the  Hinds  objecting  on  religious grounds and the Muhammadans being too apathetic. The bubonic type of the disease prevailed, but the statistics regarding  type  are  said not to be very accurate.    The pneumonic type Type.                                                                          was noted to be very fatal. The lower classes were the most affected by outbreak of plague. It was noticed that no case occurred in any of the Christian schools in the district, in many of which children of the poorer classes are educated. The difference is attributed by the District Plague Medical Officer to the better sanitary condition prevailing in these schools. Females suffered more than males both as regards their liability to attack by and death from plague. The following Medical Officers and subordinates were employed  on plague duty in the district :-Captain P. B. Haig, I. M. S., and Medical Staff and Establishment.            Dr. L. Jones, District Plague Medical Officers, Dr. C. P. Husband, Dr. G. Warner, Dr. Reilly,  Dr.  A. S. McSorley,  Inoculating Medical Officers, Assistant Surgeon Amrk Singh and 10 Compounders. GUJRANWALA  DISTRICT. The Gujrnwla District suffered from a very severe epidemic of plague during the year  under  report, and was the most seriously Epidemic.                          affected district  in  the   Province   during  the present season. The epidemic affected a much larger area than during the previous year, in all 720 villages becoming infected. There were 70,329 cases with 45,456 deaths during the present epidemic, whilst during the previous season there had been only 3,319 cases with 2,244 deaths. There were outbreaks in nearly all the villages of the Wazrabad and Guj- rnwla Tahsls, and the disease spread into the Hfizabad and Khngah Dogrn Tahsls. Throughout the previous hot weather dropping cases had been occurring in various vil- lages. In Gujrnwla Town the disease was apparently a recrudescence of the previous year's epidemic. In the case of all other places, however, a distinct history of importation from without was obtained. An imported case occurred in the town of Hfizabad on October the 10th, 1902, but owing to prompt measures the disease did not spread, with the result that this tahsl remained free from plague till February 1903. In the middle of February the disease broke out both in the town of Hfizabad and in the villages of the tahsl, and became so severe in the town that for a time it was more or less deserted. The mortality steadily rose from the commencement of the season up till the last week in De- cember, from which time till the last week in January there was a lull in the growth of the epidemic. This was followed by a great upward bound in the first week of February. The numbers then again grew steadily until the climax was  reached in  the   week   ending
?25 April the 18th, when 6,418 cases with 4,275 deaths were recorded. These were the high- est weekly totals returned by any single district in the Province during the present epi- demic. From this time onwards the disease rapidly declined, the last cases occurring during the week ending July the 11th. The disease reappeared during the week ending September the 26th. The exceptional rainfall and consequent reduction of the tempera- ture at the commencement of the hot weather were held to have prolonged the season of the epidemic. Attitude. The attitude of the people was at first distinctly adverse to all Government measures,                                    but later as the epidemic became severe they availed themselves of inoculation and of desiccation in certain places. Preventive measures.  At Gujrnwla Town surveillance over all arrivals by train from  the Silkot District was maintained. In the villages, however, very                    little was done to prevent the access of persons from infected places. Guards were, however, placed around some villages to exclude strangers, but without much effect. Reference has already been made to measures taken at Hafizabad in connection with an imported case of plague. The Patwri of Rampur, a village of the Hfizabad Tahsl, refused admission to a man who had come from an infected village. He was put in a Chamr's house outside the village and died ten days later of plague. The house was disinfected and the disease did not spread. Information. Information of plague cases  and   deaths  was  obtained  from Patwrs  according to                                        the  instructions in the Plague Manual, but the reporting was very imperfect. Evacuation. Evacuation of villages, and the  segregation  of sick  and  contacts,   were  measures                                         which   were   never  resorted   to.    Beyond    a few destitute cases treated in  the hospital at Gujrnwla Town no medical treatment was ever carried out.  Disinfection.                                 Chemical disinfection was most unpopular, and though a gang of coolies was kept up, only 141 rooms were done.  Desiccation.   Desiccation was commenced in March and became fairly popular, 4,065 rooms being so                        treated.   A table is given by the District Plague Medical   Officer   and    is    reproduced   below showing 351 rooms in which the wall temperature was taken and 1;768 rooms   in which the ground  temperature   was  taken.     A   registering  thermometer  was  not used :- Table showing the Number of Rooms desiccated in the Gujrnwla District from 3oth April 1903 to 22nd June, and the Ground Temperature recorded. Serial No. Height of temperature. Number of rooms showing the temperature. 1 Below 130 89 2 130-139 79 3 140-144 71 4 145-149 44 S 150-158 426 6 Above 158 1,059  Total 1,768 The table shows that in the majority of cases temperatures over 150 Fahr. were obtained. The wall temperatures were higher than the ground temperatures A few experiments were made with a stove with a forced draught. It gave ground temperatures of 140 to 160 in 45 minutes To desiccate a room 10 x 10 x 10 it was found necessary to burn 10 seers of charcoal, 15 seers of wood or 20 seers of cowdung. As all the desiccation was done late in the season, it was not possible to decide whether the absence of recrudescence which followed it was due to the desiccation itself or to the natural decline of the epidemic. The Deputy Commissioner was of opinion that if the stoves were left in the charge of Zaildrs they would not be much used.
?26 Infection. Human intercourse was believed to be the chief factor in the spread of plague in the Gjrnwla District, though the outbreak in Gujrnwla Town was considered to be due to a recrudescence from the previous epidemic. The people frequently attributed the infection of their villages to rats, numbers of which died in almost every infected village before plague became general in it. Influence of local conditions. No relation could be traced between the nature of th soil and the incidence of the disease. The District Plague Medical Officer remarks that villages which were surrounded with " kallar, " those in the "Charkhari " of Gujrnwla with a subsoil water level of 20 to 30 feet, and those of "the Bar," where the water was over 40 feet from the surface, were equally affected by the epidemic. Rats and other animals. It was commonly recognized among the people that mortality amongst rats was a sure precursor of the disease. In the only two cases where the interval was determined, it was found that the outbreak among human beings occurred 14 days after the mortality among rats was noticed Dogs, cats and squirrels died in places where the epidemic was rife. The symptoms in dogs were swelling of the glands of the neck, fever and rapid death. No measures were taken by the people to destroy rats. Plaster of Paris and " ata " was experimented with in the jail, but was not a success. Type The commonest type of plague in the Gujrnwla District was the bubonic. At Aklgrh and Gujrnwla Towns a typ of disease was reported in which there was fever, vomit- ting of blood and death within 48 hours. It is believed to have been pneumonic plague, and in the instance in Gujrnwla Town 12 mistris who lived in different houses, but work- ed in the same shop and smoked from the same hukah, all died of the form of plague. The Civil Surgeon considered that some cases reported as plague were really attacks of cere- bro-spinal fever. It was observed in all cases where pregnant women were attacked with plague that they aborted and died. Among the sequel of plague the District Plague Medical Officer notices marasmus, in children, with wasting of the muscle of the leg on the same side as the bubo, paraplegia and difficulty of speech. In one instance an attack of acute pneumonia followed upon one of plague. Medical Staff and Establishment. The Medical Officers and subordinates employed on plague duty in the district were as follows :-Captain S. A. Harris, I. M S., District Plague Medical Officer, Dr. G Beley and Captain R. M. Blaker, Inoculating Medical Officers, Assistant Surgeon Ashtosh Datta, Assistant Surgeon D H. Bharucha and 4 Compounders. MONTGOMERY DISTRICT. Epidemic. 38. The Montgomery District was visited with plague for the first time in March 1903. The disease broke out in the Diplpur Tahsil and an outbreak followed in which 655 cases of plague with 228 deaths occurred. Infection was introduced from the Chunin Tahsil of Lahore which adjoins the Diplpur Tahsil. At the end of March the Gugera and Montgomery Tahsils were infected from the Jhng District. The population of the infected areas were terrified at the appearance of the epidemic in their midst and fled in large numbers from their homes. At first they obstinately refused to adopt any of the measures suggested to them by Government. Preventive measures. Such was the attitude of the people that beyond a small amount of desiccation absolutely no preventive or palliative measures were ever undertaken. Disinfection. Eighty rooms were desiccated with Sawhney's stove, but the people were so ignorant and intractable that they even dreaded and avoided this measure Fifteen seers of wood were used, and the prescribed temperature was obtained within the hour and maintained for another hour. Such evidence as could be obtained indicated that infection was ordinarily con- veyed by human agency, though it was disseminated throughout infected villages by rats.
?27 Type. The bubonic form of plague prevailed and was of a somewhat mild type. Only 34.81 per cent. of the cases reported proved fatal. The comparative mildness of the epidemic and the low fatality of attacks is attributed by the District Plague Medical Officer to the scattered nature of the population, and to the hot climate of the district. The classes most attacked were Hinds of the Arora and Kamboh castes. Females suffered more than males. Medical Staff and Establishment. The Medical Officers  and establishment  on plague duty in the district were as follows:- Dr. Gardiner, Assistant Surgeon Basharat Ahmad and a Compounder. LAHORE DISTRICT. Epidemic. Review. 39.  The Lahore District became infected with plague for the second time during the year under report The present epidemic was more severe than the former, there having been in all 759 towns and villages infected, with 54,284 cases and 25,652 deaths. During the previous epidemic there had been 20,214 cases with 9400 deaths. The epidemic rose steadily from the commencement of the season, with a slight lull during the second half of January, to reach its climax during the week ending May the 2nd, when 6,181 cases with 2,952 deaths were returned. Attitude of the people. On the outbreak of the disease at the commencement of the season the people were by no means afraid of it, for the cases were of a mild type and the mortality rather low. There was, however, a scare among the people of the infected areas when the disease became widespread and acquired a more virulent character. Those of the inhabit- ants who had had an opportunity of watching the effects of the measures designed for the mitigation of the disease during the previous season were favourably disposed towards the adoption of similar precautions during the present one. But where the epidemic broke out for the first time this season the people had but little faith in such measures and could with difficulty be prevailed upon to adopt them. The inhabitants of the Kasr Tahsil were the best disposed towards plague measures, whereas those of the Sharakpur Tahsil adopted them least of all. Preventive measures. There was no surveillance of any kind over arrivals from infected areas, and the villagers never refused access to their villages to persons from infected areas. Disinfection. One thousand three hundred and ninty-three rooms were chemically disinfected and 143 desiccated. Some experiments were made with Sawhney's stove in Lahore City. It was found that to desiccate a room 10 x 10 x 10 feet about two maunds of cowdung cakes, costing ten annas, had to be used. In half an hour the temperature taken by a thermometer hung on the wall one foot from the floor recorded a temperature from 180 to 200 Fahr. This gradually fell to 130 in 15 to 20 minutes, and fresh fuel had then to be added. In this way the temperature could be kept up for two hours. No difficulty was experienced in carrying out the measure, which was popular and much preferred to chemical disinfection. The people did not remove the contents of the rooms. When wood was used in the stoves 21/2 maunds were required, costing one rupee. The temperature, however, was not raised so rapidly as when "pthi" was used. Another form of stove, named from its inventor the "Holden" stove, gave satisfactory results at Clarkabad. Four villages- Dholanwl, Pakki Thatti, Sirirmpura and Chakabad-were thoroughly evacuated and disinfected. The results were satisfactory. Segregation. Segregation of sick was never practised. Treatment. Medical treatment was accepted in some places to a very considerable extent. Infection Personal communication was as a rule the means of spreading the infection from infected to uninfected places. It was often noticed that, even when men were suspected to be the bearers of infection, women were the first to develope the disease. Persons suffering from the pneumonic variety of the disease were found to be the most dangerous transmitters of the disease. Rats. Mortality of rats was very commonly traced in  connection with plague. Of 28 villages, concerning which special en- quiries were  made, 19 reported mortality among rats to have followed the first human case, whilst 9 reported that rats began to die before the outbreak among the people,
?28 At one village two dogs were observed to die within a few hours after  suffering front high fever with glandular swellings in the neck. Type. Throughout the district the type wasin the main bubonic, though  there was also some pneumonic and septicmic plague. Influence of local conditions Plague was noted to be worst in the least dry parts of the district. As regards liability, it was noticed that persons living in the lower floors of houses were more liable to attack  than those living in the upper stories. Medical Staff and Establishment. The following Medical Officers and subordinates were employed on plague duty in the district:-Captain H. Ainsworth, I. M. S., and Captain P. B. Haig, I. M. S., District Plague Medical Officers, Dr. Wilkinson, Dr. Douglas, Dr. Gardiner, Dr. Henley, Dr. D. D. Pandya, Inoculating Medical Officers, Assistant Surgeon Hari Ll Basu, Assistant Surgeon Shiv Das, 1 Hospital Assistant and 10 Compounders. AMRITSAR DISTRICT. Epidemic. 40.    The Amritsar District became infected with plague for the second time during the year under report. During the previous season there had been 3,145 cases with 1,837 deaths, 60 towns and villages being infected. The present epidemic was of much greater severity : 41,508 plague cases with 27,891 deaths occurred, and 563 towns and villages were infected. At the beginning of October Amritsar City itself was the only place in the district infected. Six villages, however, became infected during October, and from thence onwards, the epidemic gradually spread. The number of attacks and deaths steadily rose week by week till the last week in December, from which time till the last week in January the epidemic was almost stationary. During the first week in February there was a sudden rise in the numbers of plague cases and deaths, and the epidemic then rapidly gathered strength, reaching its climax in April. After the early part of May the epidemic rapidly declined, the disease almost disappearing during the first week in August. The attitude of the people towards all Government measures was at first one of dis- trust and suspicion, but as the people got to know officials on plague duty they became less distrustful. They frequently asked for advice as to how best to avoid the disease, and a small vernacular pamphlet was accordingly distributed to them, briefly detailing what should be done to combat the epidemic. Preventive measures. No attempt was made by the inhabitants of healthy villages to exclude persons coming from infected places, but the inhabitants of one village spontaneously removed an imported case of plague to a field a mile away from the village, with the result that an outbreak was prevented. Information. The Plague Medical  Officer remarks that the reporting of plague occurrences was at first very defective and cases were concealed. He attributes this to the people's fear of Government interference, and adds that as the people realised that their fears were groundless, reporting gradually improved. This was partly due also to the importance of their duties in this respect having been impressed upon Patwrs. Disinfection Chemical disinfection was not at all popular with the people, and consequently very little was done. In many villages the inhabit- ants  took  advantage  of the  advice given in the pamphlet previously mentioned concerning simple methods of disinfection by fire, boiling water, exposure to sun, phenyle, &c., and a certain amount of good was probably done in this way. Infection. The majority of villages were infected by human intercourse. A common history given was that the first person attacked with plague had recently returned from an infected village. The next step was the death of rats in the infected and adjoining houses, followed by a rapid spread of plague throughout the village. Of 391 villages in which enquiries were made, 284 reported mortality among rats prior to human beings developing the disease, 71 reported it to be subsequent to the outbreak among human beings, and 36 reported no rat mortality at all. The District Plague Medical Officer remarks, how- ever, that these observations do not pretend to any scientific accuracy, as very often the first human case preceded rat mortality, but was concealed or overlooked by the villagers. After the first introduction the main factor in the rapid and wide distribution of the infection throughout the village was the rat. Usually human cases followed rat cases in about 6 to 7 days. The period varied from 3 to 14 days.
?29 Of 6o villages infected during the previous season, 40 became re-infected during the present. Those badly affected previously were lightly affected this time. In the great majority of cases the re-infection was traced to importation from without, and in only a few instances did it apparently arise spontaneously, and in these cases the outbreak was preceded by unusual rat mortality. In no case did a village, which had been infected during the pre- vious season and subsequently declared free, become a source or focus of infection during the present epidemic. On the subject of the infection of villages with plague, Captain Browning Smith, I. M. S., the District Plague Medical Officer, notes :-" Although infection can be traced in the majority of villages to the agency of man, in quite a considerable number no history of such importation can be elicited, which induces me to raise the following question : Can the pathogenic power of the bacillus be of so mild a character that it may remain latent, producing no percepti- ble disease, or disease of such a mild type that it is not recognised as plague, until, by infecting and passing through the rat, its virulence is so intensified that infection from the rat produces a fatal epidemic ?" Influence of local conditions. Referring to the effect  of local conditions in the course of the epidemic, the District Plague Medical Officer notes that those parts of the district adjoining the river kept free from plague until well on into the spring. Rats and other animals. In the majority of villages squirrels  died in considerable numbers, dropping dead from the trees near infected houses. When people evacuated their houses and lived  near their wells there were frequent deaths among the squirrels living in the trees near the wells. There were  instances in  some villages of unusual mortality amongst dogs. A fortnight after  plague broke out at the village of Wanake, out of 10 dogs attached to one house, 9 died in two or three days. In a temple outside the village 7 died. Deaths among cats were also reported. In one village, Laukha, after the epidemic was at an end, large number of sparrows died, dropping dead from the roofs of the houses. It was a matter of general remark that in most villages, when an epidemic became at all severe, crows, which usually abounded, completely deserted the village. They returned after the epidemic was at an end. No dead crows were ever found. No unusual mortality among cattle was reported. Type. The type of the disease was mostly bubonic, but there were some epidemics of the pneumonic form, especially in the Tarn Taran Tahsil, where also some septic cases of plague occurred. Medical Staff and Establishment. The following Medical Officers and subordinates were employed on plague duty in the district:-Captain S. B. Smith, I. M. S., District  Plague Medical Officer, Dr. A. C. De Renzi, Dr.  Mayer,  Dr.Heron, Dr. C. Cavanagh, Inoculating Medical Officers, 2 Hospital Assistants and 4 Compounders. GURDASPUR DISTRICT. Epidemic. 41.    This the third epidemic which has visited the Gurdaspur District was less severe than of the previous season. There were 8,242 cases with 5,164 deaths in the present epidemic as compared with 25,868 cases with 16,479 deaths during the preceding one. At the beginning of the season the Pathnkot Tahsl was the only one infected, and there the disease was almost confined to the town itself. The epidemic steadily rose, with a slight lull during January, till it reached its maximum during the week ending May the 2nd. After this it declined and disappeared during August. Preventive measures. There was never any surveillance over arrivals from infected areas, and it was very doubtful whether any persons from infected areas were ever prevented from entering other villages.
?30 Information. The  Patwrs  and  Municipal Muharrirs submitted the prescribed returns, and whenever possible they  were checked. They were often incomplete. Evacuation. Segregation. Treatment. Evacuation was resorted to in some cases, and, although never complete, was pro- ductive of some good.  The segregation of sick and their contacts was never practised. Medical treatment was fairly generally accept- ed. Disinfection. Two thousand seven hundred and sixty-seven rooms were disinfected chemically with satisfactory results, and 165 were desiccated, but too late in the season to estimate the value  of the process.    Desiccation was very popular, and the people used the stoves themselves. About 13 seers of charcoal were used each time for an average-sized room. Infection. The first sign of the infection of a village  was usually the death of rats. It was observed that the interval which elapsed between the  death of rats and  the appearance of the disease among human beings was about six days. Type. The type of the disease was mainly bubonic, with a small percentage of pneumonic and septicsemic cases. One curious case of re- lapse was observed where a boy aged 14 years went through an attack of bubonic plague with an inguinal bubo. On the ninth day, when he was apparently recovering and was going about, he developed a cervical bubo, became delirious, and rapidly died. Influence of local conditions. Elevated sites were said to be less severely affected than lowlying ones. The more elevated portions of villages were said to have suffered less than parts more lowly situated. The comparatively small incidence of plague in the Pathnkot Tahsl was attributed to the villages being so thinly scattered. Medical Staff and Establishment. The following Medical Officers and subordinates were employed on plague duty in the district :-Captain P. St. C. More, I. M. S., District Plague Medical Officer, Dr. J. M. Benson, Dr. A. P.B. Ellis, Dr. E. N. Thornton, Dr. F. Goldsmith, Dr. G. Manook, Inoculating Medical Officers, 6 Compounders. Assistant Surgeon G. C. Chatterjee with 1 Hospital Asistant and 2 Dhais was posted to the Plague Inspection Post at Dunera. GUJRAT DISTRUCT. Epidemic. 42.    The epidemic  under report was the second which  has visited the district, and though never very severe, was more so than the preceding one-4,363 cases of plague with 2,829 deaths having been reported as against 928 cases and 553 deaths recorded during the outbreak of 1901-02. The town of Gujrt was already infected at the commencement of the present year, and the disease spread to some villages of this tahsl in October 1902. The Phlia Tahsl became infected in November 1902 and the Kharin Tahsl in March 1903. The epidemic did not increase very much in strength until the last week in March, when it became much worse and reached its maximum during the fourth week in April. About three-fourths of the cases were in the Gujrt Tahsl. The majority of the population were Muhammadans, and they were at first absolutely indifferent, both to the progress of the epidemic and to the measures taken to prevent it. In several villages when the epidemic became at all severe a great number of the inhabitants took to flight.  Often so many ran away that the shops in the villages were closed. Preventive measures. Neither in towns nor in villages was any  surveillance exercised over arrivals from infected areas. The villagers never refused access to their villages to persons from infected places. Segregation. Evacuation. Treatment The segregation of the sick and their contacts was never practised either in Gujrt City itself or anywhere else. Evacuation was never resorted to. Medical  treatment was seldom applied for
?31 Information. The prescribed returns were submitted by Patwrs and were checked as much as possible  whenever an officer visited a vil- lage. Disinfection. One hundred and sixty-seven rooms were chemically disinfected and 3:884  were desiccated. Chemical disinfection or desiccation was carried out in nearly every infected house in Gujrt City. The people were opposed to the chemical treatment of their personal effects, but they did not object to their being desiccated. When desiccation became available it entirely supplanted chemical disinfection, for personal effects as well as houses were disinfected by this means. Temperatures on the ground were obtained up to 130 Fahr., and 9 to 10 seers of charcoal were found to be sufficient for an average-sized room. Dr. Thornton, who was for some time District Plague Medical Officer, devoted special attention to desic- cation and made experiments with different patterns of stoves. He mentions that some cases of carbonic oxide poisoning occurred when charcoal was used in Sawhney's stove: the cases recovered. Infection. In most instances where a village became infected a distinct history could be obtained that either the patient or the relatives  had come into contact with a case  of plague. In certain villages the disease recrudesced after a period of quiescence. Rats. No information  is available concerning rat mortality in  the Gujrt District in relation to outbreaks of plague. Rewards were offered in Gujrt City for the destruc- tion of rats, but none were claimed. Type. Though several cases of pneumonic and septicmic plague were seen, the prevalent type was the bubonic. Medical Staff and Establishment. The Medical staff and establishment on plague duty in the district were as follows:- Captain Stephenson, I. M. S., Dr. Baron, Dr. A. M. Elliot, Dr. Thornton, Assistant Surgeon Muhammad Hussain, Assistant Surgeon Abdul Rahman, 1 Hospital Assistant and 4 Com- pounders. SHAHPUR DISTRICT. Epidemic. 43.    The epidemic of plague in the Shahpur District during the year under report was a mild one, though more severe than that of the previous season: 435 cases of plague with 206 deaths were reported in 1901-02, while during the present year 948 cases with 585 deaths occurred. With the exception of one imported case in Shahpur Town in October 1902, the district remained free of plague until late in February 1903. The disease then broke out in a village in the Bhera Tahsil, but was not reported until March. In April the Shahpur and Khushab Tahsils became infected. The people were opposed to plague measures and gave no assistance in carrying them out. Preventive measures. Evacuation. Segregation. Treatment No surveillance over arrivals from infected areas was exercised in any place, but the people of Shahpur, Bhera and Sahiwl tried to prevent the entry into their towns of persons coming from infected places. There was no- where any thorough evacuation, though some of the people of the villages left their houses and lived in temporary shelters or under trees outside their villages. In Municipal towns the sick with their contacts were kept outside the town in temporary sheds. At one village some of the sick were segregated by their relatives. European medical treatment was not accepted, native treatment being preferred, Disinfection. Forty-four rooms were chemically  disinfected and 439  were desiccated. In Khushb, Shahpur, Bhera and Mini the infected houses and those in their immediate vicinity were chemically disinfected with good results. No cases occurred in these quar- ters after disinfection.  Desiccation by Sawhney's stoves was  readily  accepted. Charcoal,
?32 wood and cowdung were used as fuel. Fifteen seers of cowdung were found sufficient to raise the temperature to over 200 Fahr. in half an hour and to maintain it over 122 Fahr. for an hour. Cowdung raised the temperature sooner than wood. No recrudescence occurred after desiccation. Infection. There was no evidence of any recrudescence of last year's epidemic, as in every instance a distinct history of the importation  of a case in the  incubating stage was  obtained.  The cases were imported from the Jhang, Gujrnwla and Gujrt Districts. Rats. Rats were reported to have died in places before the disease became epidemic amongst human beings. Type. In the villages of the Shahpur and Bhera Tahsils the  disease was largely of the pneumonic type; in the Khushb Tahsl it was mainly bubonic. The Muhammadans as a class suffered most severely from the disease. Medical Sfaff and Establishment. The Medical Officers and subordinates on  plague duty were as follows:-Captain Turner, I. M. S., Dr. M. Doyle, Assistant Surgeon  Jagat  Narin, Assistant Surgeon Bashrat Ahmad and 3 Compounders. JHELUM DISTRICT. Epidemic. 44. This epidemic  under report is the first which has visited the Jhelum District. The disease  first  appeared in May 1903, and only 129 cases with 83  deaths occurred.  The epidemic was confined to the Jhelum  Tahsl. Only the city and one village were infected. Preventive measures. No surveillance over arrivals from infected areas was maintained, and the  people never refused to admit to their villages persons from infected areas. Segregation and evacuation were never practised in the town except in the first case which occurred, which was isolated, but in the village Muftin the inhabitants were very amenable to advice and evacuated the place, at the same time isolating their sick and segre- gating all contacts. As a result of this, the epidemic was stopped at Muftin. In all cases houses and effects were chemically disinfected and the bedding and clothes of most persons who had died of the disease were burnt. Disinfection. 309 rooms were  chemically  disinfected and 267 were  desiccated. Ten seers of charcoal were used for an average-sized room. One disadvantage observed was that rats left the desiccated quarters and invaded the neighbouring houses. Infection. The infection both of Jhelum City and of the village of  Muftin was due to human agency. The first case in Jhelum City was a pleader's nephew who had come from Gujrn- wla. This case did not spread the disease, as it was isolated. The second case, which was imported into the city, was a peculiar one in that symptoms of the disease did not develope until 10 days after arrival. The patient, a girl, came from Jallpur Jattn, an infected village in the Gujrt District, and during the incubating stage she attended and infected a school. The village Muftin is on the way to a salt spring at Garat, which is annually visited by persons from the Silkot, Gujrt and Gujrnwala Districts. It was probably these people who introduced infection. After the first imported case in Jhelum City it was noticed that rats were dying in large numbers in certain streets, in which the disease then assumed an epidemic form among human beings. Periods varying from 2 to 15 days elapsed between the death of rats in a house and the appearance of the disease among the occupants. It was remarked that while the grain market was infected with rats these animals avoided going to certain houses where kerosine oil was stored. Type. The type of plague was mainly bubonic; pneumonic and  septicmic cases were very uncommon and far more fatal. Medical Staff and Etablishment The District Medical Staff  performed plague duty in addition to their ordinary work, and only one Hospital Assistant was detailed to the district for purely plague duty.
?33 RAWALPINDI DISTRICT. Epidemic. 45.    Except for some rather doubtful cases, the Rawalpindi District had escaped an outbreak of plague until the present year. This season it was introduced into the city and the neighbouring Cantonment in May. The outbreak, which was practically confined to the Rawalpindi Tahsil, resulted in 603 cases with 455 deaths and ran a somewhat abnormal course, as it never died down during the hot weather. The city was infected on the 28th of May 1903, and 549 plague cases with 414 deaths occurred in it. The Cantonment was also infected on the 28th of May 1903, but only 28 plague  cases with r6 deaths occurred here. In villages infected afterwards altogether 26 plague cases with 25 deaths occurred. The attitude of the people was averse to any plague measures at first, but later on they showed a tendency to co-operate with the authorities. Preventive measures. No surveillance of any sort  was exercised over arrivals from infected areas. The first few cases that occurred in the  city   were isolated, the  contacts segregated and the houses evacuated, but in spite of these measures the disease spread. Disinfection. 214 rooms were chemically disinfected and 269 were desiccated  With Sawhney's stoves. It was found that 15 seers of charcoal, costing eight annas, were necessary to raise the temperature of an average-sized room to 160 Fahr. The people did desiccation them- selves by burning cowdung cakes on the floors of their houses. Infection- Infection appears to have been  due to human agency, though rats died in houses prior to the outbreak of plague in them, the period elapsing varying from 5 to 20 days. The bubonic type of plague prevailed. Medical staff and establishment. Assistant Surgeon P.B. Bannerjee, with 2 Hospital Assistants and 2 Dhis, was posted to the plague inspection post on the Murree Road in the district. In addition to the above staff one Hospital Assistant was detailed for plague duty in the district. The local Medical staff concerned also performed plague duty in addition to their ordinary duties. MIANWALI DISTRICT. 46. Only three cases of plague, all of them imported, occurred in the Minwli District during the year under report. The first case came to Bhakkar from Jhang and died of pneumonic plague on arrival. The other two cases, a mother and her son, came to Klbgh from the Gujranwala District and developed bubonic plague on arrival. All these cases were promptly dealt with and the disease did not spread. All infected houses were chemi- cally disinfected, as were the personal effects of the patients. MOOLTAN DISTRICT. 47. There were only four cases in the Mooltan District during the year 1902-03. All were imported respectively from Meean Meer, Silkot, Gujrnwla and Lahore. The cases, were all promptly dealt with and the disease did not spread. JHANG DISTRICT. Epidemic. 48.    The Jhang District was infected with plague for the second time during the year under report.  During the second epidemic 3,813  cases of plague occurred with 2,597 deaths as against 311 cases with 176 deaths recorded during 1901-02. From its commencement in October the epidemic increased very slowly, but steadily, until it reached its climax in April. The first case occurred in Jhang town on October 12th,   1902,  but owing to the prompt measures taken the disease did not spread. Lyallpur City became infected on November 2nd, and an outbreak followed which did not cease until May 1903. The disease did not spread in the  Lyallpur Tahsil until
?34 January 1903. Chiniot City became infected in November 1902 and the tahsl in January 1903. Plague broke out in the Samundri Tahsl in February and in the Toba Tek Singh Tahsl in April 1903. The greater portion of the population are Muhammadans, though in the colony there is a very large population of various races. The people of the Jhang and Maghina cities were very favourably disposed towards plague measures, but those in other parts of the district were much opposed to all such measures until late in the epidemic. When the epidemic became bad in Lyallpur town over 4,000 persons fled from it within a fortnight, and when the disease visited Dijkot, a village containing 2,200 inhabitants, 2,000 persons fled within 10 days. Preventive measures. In Jhang-Maghina City two hakims were appointed to visit and report upon all sus- picious cases of sickness. The arrangements for reporting cases were good, and all cases as they occurred were detected and promptly segregated, with the result that the disease did not spread. In Lyallpur and Chiniot cities, however, nothing of this sort was done, and both suffered, the latter very severely. From the villages the Patwrs submitted the returns, and in towns the cases were reported by hakims and compounders. The returns were checked whenever an officer visited a village. Evacuation. Some evacuation was done by those people in the colony who  had had experience  of the disease in other parts of the Punjab. But it was never done thoroughly, though what was practised had good results. Segregation. Strict segregation of sick was carried out in all cases in Jhang-Maghina City and in a certain number of cases in Lyallpur City. Some of the contacts were segregated, others only supervised. Occasionally villagers refused access to persons  from infected areas. Very little medical treatment was applied for, the people preferring their native remedies. Disinfection. Chemical disinfection, both of houses and personal effects, was carried out in  all cases which occurred  in  Jhang-Maghina City. Chiniot City only applied for disinfection late in the epidemic. At Gojra in Toba Tek Singh Tahsl chemical disinfection of part of the village was done at the commencement of an outbreak, and the disease was stopped. At Chak No. 224 in the Lyallpur Tahsl after 9 cases had occurred chemical disinfection and desiccation were done, and no further cases occurred. Altogether 1,967 rooms were chemically disinfected. Sawhney's stoves were used in several places and with charcoal temperatures up to 140 were obtained on the ground. Desiccation became very popular, as the people entertained no suspicions with regard to it; 810 rooms were desiccated. Infection. Infection was always due to human importation.  In some cases the first thing that came to light was the death of rats, but in all these cases it was suspected that there had been a concealed case prior to this occurring. Rats. It was observed that when the mortality amongst rats was high the epidemic among human beings was proportionately high. Cats and dogs were observed to die in places when the epidemic was at its height. Type. The bubonic type of plague largely prevailed, though it is reported that at the end of December and the beginning of January the majority of cases of plague were of the pneumonic type. The District Plague Medical Officer records that the severe outbreaks of plague occurred among the sweepers of Lyallpur and the dhobies of Chiniot. Medical staff and establishment. The Medical  Officers and subordinates employed on plague duty were as follows :- Assistant Surgeon K. C. Singha, Assistant Surgeon D. N. Mukhopadhya and 2 Com- pounders.
?35 NATIVE STATES. 49. Of the eight Native States in which outbreaks of plague occurred during the year 1902-03, namely, Patila, Kapurthala, Nbha, Kalsia, Mler Kotla, Jnd, Fardkot and Dujna, reports have been received from four only, Kapurthala, Mler Kotla, Fardkot and Dujna. The reports of plague in the three first-named States were furnished by their respective Medical Officers; that of the Dujna State was written by the Civil Surgeon of Gurgaon, who was in charge of the medical arrangements in connection with plague in the State. KAPURTHALA STATE. 50. The epidemic in the Kapurthala State, although widespread, was not very severe except in a few villages. All the tahsls of the State were infected, and outbreaks occurred at the head-quarters of each tahsl. The disease first made its appearance in the Kapurthala Tahsl on October 18th, 1902, the Phagwra Tahsl becoming infected a few days later. The Dhilwn, Kapurthala, and Sultnpur Tahsl became infected respectively in January, February and March 1903. The epidemic ceased in June; during its course 8,137 cases with 5,255 deaths were reported. Except in the case of the city of Kapurthala no measures were adopted with the object of preventing outbreaks of plague. Inspection and disinfection posts were established on the roads leading to the capital of the State in November 1907, but as in spite of them plague appeared in the city in February 1903, these arrangements were discontinued. It is reported that 35,779 persons were disinfected at these posts. No particulars are given of the extent to which chemical disinfection of infected houses and effects was resorted to, but it is mentioned that perchloride of mercury and phenyle were the disinfectants used. Towards the end of the epidemic a few houses were desiccated. Very little inoculation was done, and only 839 persons were inoculated. Of these 500 were police sepoys; the remainder were sepoys of the Imperial Service Infantry and school boys. Two cases occurred among the inoculated, one of which was fatal. With regard to the spread of infection it is stated that this was always due to human intercourse, though death among rats often preceded outbreaks of plague among human beings. In some places large numbers of rats died. The following table gives particulars of the outbreaks of the head-quarter towns and of certain villages which suffered severely :- Table showing plague seizures and deaths in the Kapurthala State.

36 MALER KOTLA. 5t. Plague first appeared in the Mler Kotla State in October 1902, having been intro- duced from the town of Bassi. The epidemic came to an end in June 1903 and between the date mentioned 45 towns and villages were infected, in which 2,024 cases of plague with 1,882 deaths were reported. The tahsls of Mler Kotla and Punjgarain, together with their head-quarter towns, were infected,  1,158 cases with 1,112 deaths occurring in the city of Mler Kotla. The Medical Officer of the State remarks that though the people were much frightened of plague in the previous epidemic, they bore the present one with much patience and did little or nothing to protect themselves and were strongly opposed to any State measures. Inspection posts and quarantine camps were established for the protection of the capital, but with this exception no precautionary measures were observed. An attempt was made to isolate persons suffering from plague and to segregate contact in the city of Mler Kotla, but the opposition was so great that this had to be abandoned. A few villages were evacuated ; some on the occurrence of mortality among rats. A little chemical disinfection with perchloride of mercury and phenyle was carried out in the city of Mler Kotla, but desiccation was preferred. This was performed by the people themselves under the supervision of an Hospital Assistant, wood or charcoal being burnt in open fires on the floors. The only inoculations performed in the State were done by Dr. Fatteh Chand, the Civil Surgeon of Ludhina who at the invitation of the State authorities visited Mler Kotla in October 1902 and addressed a meeting on the subject of inoculation. As the result of this address 1,501 persons were inoculated during the following few days. The infection of plague is said to have been carried by human intercourse and rats. The relation as to time between mortality of rats and outbreaks of plague among human beings was not accurately observed, but the former usually preceded the latter, often by about 12 days. The bubonic type of plague prevailed and the poorer classes were most affected. FARDKOT STATE. 52. The only outbreaks of plague in the Fardkot State during the year under report were at the capital and at the town of Kot Kapra . Details of these outbreaks are given in a tabular form below :- Town. Population. Date of first case. Date of last case. Cases. Deaths. Inoculations. Fardkot 10,405 21st December 1903 28th June 1903 468 215 651 Kot Kapra 9,519 22nd January 1903  22nd May 1903 576 395 243    Total 1,044 610 894 Infection was introduced into Fardkot by passengers from infected towns in the Ferozepore District in spite of inspection posts and quarantine camps. No mention is made as to the method of the introduction of infection into Kot Kapra though, as the Raja and his following went to live there when plague was severe at Fardkot, it is possible that this- may have been responsible for the outbreak. No details are given concerning disinfection in the State. Lieutenant-Colonel Mulroney, I.M.S., performed 610 inoculations. The bubonic type of plague was most common, and affected chiefly the poorer classes.  State. 53. Only three villages were infected with plague in the Dujna State, all of which were infected from the neighbouring town of Rewri in the Gurgaon District. In these villages 148 cases of plague with 118 deaths occurred between February 14th, and April 7th. The people readily complied with the advice offered by the Civil Surgeon of Gurgaon, who was-placed in charge of plague measures in the State, and evacuated their villages, the people of infected villages taking great pains to exclude strangers. All infected houses were chemically disinfected, except three, in which desiccation was practised. Mr. Charters remarks that the inflammable nature of the houses renders desiccation dangerous. No inoculations were performed.
37 PART II.-INOCULATION. Introduction. Review of previous plague measures. 54.    When plague first appeared in the Punjab in October 1897 vigorous efforts were made to stamp it out, and, though not com- pletely successful, the measures taken had the effect of confining the disease until October 1900 almost completely to the area in which it first appeared, namely, to the adjoining Nawashahr and Garhshankar Tahsls of the Jullundur and Hoshirpura   During the cold weather of 1900, however, the disease made its appearance in the Shakargarh Tahsl of the Gurdspur District and attacked several villages in this and the adjoining Zafarwl  Tahsl of the Silkot  District. Small outbreaks also occurred in the districts of Ferozepore, Ludhina  and   Ambala, and   in   the  Native States   of Patila and Kapurthala. 55. Until towards the end of the plague season of 1900-01 most of the measures adopted for dealing with the disease were compulsory. Thus cordons were placed around infected villages to prevent intercourse between their inhabitants and those of uninfected places, the isolation of the sick and the segregation of contacts were insisted upon, evacuation of infected houses and villages was enforced, and all persons were required to submit to the disinfection of their infected houses and effects by official agency. The opposition of the people, however, to many of these measures made it impossible for Government to enforce them once the disease had spread beyond a limited area, and in. accordance with the policy of the Government of India nearly all restrictions upon the movements of persons from infected places were removed in October 1900, and the principle of compulsion was almost completely abandoned for dealing with plague in the Punjab from May 1901 onwards. When, therefore, plague re-appeared in an epidemic form at the commencement of the cold weather of 1901 the extent to which measures could be adopted for checking its progress depended almost entirely upon the wishes of the people themselves, with what result has been shown in the Plague Report for the year 1901-02. Nearly everywhere the people preferred to be left to their own resources, and the little they did for their own protection was not of much use, for plague spread like wild fire over the greater part of the Province and in a few months carried off over 200,000 of its   inhabitants. During the cold weather of 1901-02 plague had spread throughout the greater part of the plains of the Punjab Epidemic had occurred in all districts and Native States in an unbroken line from the River Jhelum on the west to the border of the United Provinces on the east, and the frontiers of Jammu on the north to those of Rjputna on the south. Infection had also spread to the Himalayan Hill State of Nlagarh, and imported cases- sure forerunners of indigenous outbreak-had occurred in districts bordering upon the North- West Frontier Province. It was impossible for Government to view without the greatest concern the likeli- hood of another such epidemic in the following cold weather as to leave untried any measure acceptable  to the people which held out any reasonable hope of preventing risk or calamity. Inoculation 56.    Among the measures which from the first appearance  of plague in the Punjab had been adopted for dealing with outbreaks of the disease was inoculation with Haffkine's prophylactic. The experience of four years had conclusively demonstrated that inoculation, while it involved only slight and temporary inconvenience and when carried out with due precaution was absolutely harmless, afforded for some time a very considerable protection against the attacks of plague and greatly reduced the fatality of attacks. No compulsion had ever been used to induce the acceptance of the operation, but the people had very largely availed themselves of it. During the season of 1899-1900 nearly 290,000 of the 345,000 inhabitants of the Nawashahr and Garshankar Tahsls had been inoculated, the majority during the hot weather of 1900, when special efforts were made with the hope that another outbreak. of plague among them might be averted, and though this hope was disappointed, yet the benefit of the measure was very marked, and the confidence of the people in the measure was established in so much so that, although no special inducements were held out to the people to be inoculated during the subsequent epidemic, 193,487 persons were inoculated in British Districts in 1900-01 and in 1901-02, the demand for the operation in certain districts during the height of the last epidemic having been much beyond the powers of the medical staff to meet. It should be remarked that the only inducement other than the protection against plague afforded by the operation which was ever held out to the people of infected districts in the Punjab in order to induce them to accept inoculation was the shortening by a few days.
38 of the period for which persons who lived in infected places were required to stay in special observation camps before they were permitted to leave the town or village ; this privilege could of course only be offered when restrictions were placed upon the movements of resi- dents of infected places, and the number of persons who availed themselves of it was so small in comparison to the number of persons inoculated that it was evident that the induce- ment was a very feeble one. With the abandonment of compulsory measures the possession of an inoculation certificate was of no advantage to its owner, and the fact that 82 I ,226 inoculations had been performed in the Punjab during the four-and-a-half years following the first appearance of plague in the Province was due solely to the confidence, based, of course, largely upon the advice and persuasion of Civil and Medical Officers, but also upon their own experience, of the people in the benefit of inoculation. In inoculation therefore lay a measure-indeed the only measure-of proved efficiency which was sufficiently acceptable to the people to render likely its adoption by them to an extent great enough to exercise any considerable check upon the spread of plague. Inoculation thus afforded to the Punjab Government the only hope of protecting the Province from further epidemics of plague as terrible as that which during the cold weather of 1 90 1-02 carried off, as has already been stated, over 200,000 of its inhabitants Speech by the Lieutenant-Governor. 57.    In his speech at a Darbr at Jullundur in March 1902-held for the purpose   of presenting rewards to officers and others who had rendered conspicuous services in connec- tion with measures for dealing with plague-the Lieutenant-Governor in reviewing these measures dwelt strongly upon the advantages of inoculation and urged its acceptance. His Honour said- " But in the present circumstances the measure which Government is prepared to press most vigorously is inoculation. You must understand that inoculation is in no case compulsory It has been proved by scientific enquiry that inoculation, though it does not absolutely prevent an attack of plague or avert death from that disease, has considerable power to protect from attack and to diminish the risk of death in case an attack occurs. Moreover, the effects of inoculation last for some time, though the period for which protection is afforded has not yet been determined and may not be very long, so that persons who get themselves inocu- lated should not neglect to be re-inoculated later on I can assure you that the operation does no harm, and I ask you to make your own enquiries in the villages as to its effects and to come to your own conclusions. * * * * I earnestly advise you all to be inoculated if possible now, but, if not, later on when I hope there will be a lull in the virulence of the disease. I am sorry that at the present moment in districts where inoculation is in favour it is difficult to provide sufficient staff for the prompt inoculation of all who come forward, but those who arc convinced of the value of the operation will have the opportunity of getting themselves protected, as the people of Nawashahr have done, in the season when plague is at its minimum. I w ill do my best to offer every facility for inoculation both now and in the slack season, and I trust that these facilities will not be neglected. " I again assure you that you have nothing to fear from giving information to Government officers of the occurrence of plague You understand well that no compulsion is used to force you to take measures which you do not wish to adopt, but Government is not indifferent to your sufferings and is bound to watch the spread of plague and to warn and advise those who are in danger of infection so that they may be able to take the necessary precautions and to make preparations for the disinfection and inoculation which may be required in infected areas- " If you accept the advice which I have thus offered you, and adopt the precautionary measures which I have mentioned, we may confidently hope that, although we cannot expect to get rid of plague all at once still by the mercy of Providence, the Punjab will not be afflicted next year with so severe a visitation as it is undergoing at present, and that gradually plague will die out and disappear." *                   *                    *                    *                    *                    * Preliminary considerations. 58.    Before the advantages of inoculation had been thus impressed upon the people and facilities for its performance promised, con- sideration had been given to the extent of the operations necessary in order that the inoculation might be brought within reach of all who might desire it, and that it might be so widely adopted as to afford a reasonable hope of appreciably diminishing the severity of the epidemic of plague that was to be expected during the next cold weather. As the epidemic of 1901-02 began to decline, further consideration was devoted to the possibility of carrying out inoculation operations on an extensive scale before plague should have again become severe. It was considered that in order to insure a reasonable prospect of sensibly diminishing the ravages of plague by inoculation it was necessary that about two-thirds of the population of districts in which the disease had been widespread should be inoculated before any future outbreak had attained  ascendancy.
39 During the cold weather  of   1901-02   there  had   been   outbreaks   of  plague  in  the  districts   of   Jullundur,     Hoshirpur,   Gurdaspur,   Silkot,     Ludhina,   Lahore,    Ambala, Ferozepore,   Shahpur,    Gujranwala,   Karnl,   Amritsar,   Gujrt,   Jhang  and Mooltan, and imported    cases   had   occurred   in   the    Delhi,   Mooltan,   Hissar,   Kngra,    Rwalpindi, Montgomery, Minwli and Dera Ghzi Khan Districts. It was not considered likely that the people of the Mooltan District, in which but a small outbreak of plague had been limited to a single village, or of those districts in which imported cases had occurred, would submit to inoculation, or indeed that except in the case of the city of Delhi, where for special reasons it was considered desirable to make arrange ments for inoculation, that it was necessary to include these districts for the present in any special scheme of inoculation operations. The people of the Karnl District had not availed themselves of such facilities for inoculation as had been afforded to them during the recent epidemic, and had displayed an attitude which rendered their acceptance of the measure unlikely ; it was therefore not considered necessary to make any special provision for inoculation in this district. This left 13 districts and the city of Delhi to be provided for. In these 13 districts there were 14 towns of over 150,000 inhabitants, the population of which with that of the city of Delhi amounted to about 1,011,000 persons, for the inoculation of about 500,000 of whom it was deemed advisable to make arrangements. Exclusive of that of larger towns, the population of the 13 districts mentioned amounted to about 10,000,000, of whom it was desired to inoculate 6,500,000 between September 1902 and January 1903. Arrangements had therefore to be made for the inoculation of 7,000,000 persons in five months. Supply of prophylactic. 59.    Before proceeding any further with   the   enquiry into   the   arrangements  for   a scheme of such magnitude it became necessary to ascertain whether the necessay supplies of prophylactic  would be forthcoming. The Chief Plague Medical Officer when visiting Bombay in May 1902 informally consulted Mr. Haffkine, the Director-in-Chief, Plague Research Laboratory, as to the possibility of his supplying from the beginning of September onwards about 70,000 doses of prophylactic daily, and Mr. Haffkine had given his opinion that he could meet this demand provided that he were given sufficient notice. On June 17th Mr. Haffkine, in reply to a telegram in which the same enquiry was made, stated as the result of careful enquiries that compliance with the full requirements of the Punjab was contingent only upon a sufficient supply of flasks being obtained by him from Europe, and that in case of a scarcity of flasks he could supply half the number of doses required, i.e. 35,000 doses daily, from September 1st, with daily increments. This assurance with regard to the minimum supply of prophylactic rendered it possible to proceed with the consideration of the scheme in detail. Staff; arrangements and estimates. 60.    The number of Medical Officers necessary for the performance of 6,500,000 inocula- tions in five months had to be   determined, the method for inducing the voluntary  acceptance of inoculation by so large a proportion of the population had to be considered, plans for carrying out operations on a scale of such magnitude had to be formulated, estimates had to be framed of the number of syringes and other instruments and accessories required in connec- tion with the performance of the operation of inoculation. Further, the records required, the methods of their maintenance, the establishment necessary, the number of the various forms and registers required had to be decided upon, and the manner of providing the staff and establishments with accommodation had to be considered, and finally an estimate had to be prepared of the cost of the undertaking. Preaching of inoculation. 61.    The first problem to be considered was the method of inducing the people to be inoculated, and it was considered that the best means   for   doing this was to depute   selected Assistant Commissioners and Extra Assistant Commissioners to infected districts to preach inoculation, that is to say, to expound the benefits of the measure and to do all in their power to persuade the people to accept it. It was estimated that 20 such officers would be necessary, though   it   was   expected   that all district officers would share their work. Medical staff required. 62.    The strength of the medical staff  re- quired had then to be estimated. On the basis of previous experience it was calculated that the number of inoculations which a Medical Officer could be expected to perform daily was 700, and that therefore on this estimate of 24 working days per month the number of full-time inoculators required to perform 6,500,000 operations in five months was 77. This applied to rural areas only- It was considered that Civil Surgeons and their assistants could perform all inoculations required in the towns with the help of only two other operators.
40 To meet the demand for inoculation in rural areas the number of Medical Officers and Assistant Surgeons which could be spared without disturbing the ordinary medical arrangements of the Province was 38. Of these 10 were officers of the Indian Medical Service, 5 of whom had been recently deputed to the Punjab for plague duty, 8 temporary Medical Officers, 3 Military Assistant Surgeons, 6 permanent Civil Assistant Surgeons, and 11 temporary Civil Assistant Surgeons ; 2 of the last, however, were only expected to be able to do half the work of the others : the number of Assistant Surgeons of this class was equivalent therefore to only 10 full-time inoculators. The total number of full-time inoculators in the Punjab who could be provided from the Punjab establishment thus amounted to 37, leaving a balance of 40 to be supplied from elsewhere. The help rendered in the past by Medical Missionaries as well as communications between the representatives of Missionary Societies and the Punjab Government afforded a considerable assurance that the help to be expected from this source would be equivalent to the work of 3 full-time inoculators. In order to supply the deficiency 37 Medical Officers were still required, while, in order to permit of the formation of a reserve and to provide for the assistance required in towns, it was considered that 5 additional officers would be required. It was considered desirable that the operations in each district should be in charge of an Indian Medical Service Officer, and as there were only 10 such officers available, it would be necessary to ask for the services of 5 others. With regard to the supply of the 37 operators still required, it was deemed advisable that these should be Europeans, as the people had always shown more readiness to accept inoculation at the hands of European Medical Officers than at those of their fellow-countrymen. As enquiry had shown that the supply of Medical Officers of the class desired was exhausted in India, the only alternative was to endeavour to obtain them from England : it was therefore considered necessary to try and obtain 37 medical practitioners from England. It was recognised that these gentlemen would be at a disadvantage from the want of acquaintance with the language of the people among whom they would be required to work as well as with their customs and prejudices : it was therefore arranged to attach a Nib Tahsldr to each of these officers to act as an interpretor and Personal Assistant. Establishment. 63.    In estimating the establishment required it was considered necessary  that   each inoculator in rural areas should have a com- pounder to assist him in filling syringes and in looking after instruments, as well as at least two clerks, and probably more, for   maintaining records and filling in certificates, also a chaprsi and a khalsi. It was thought that in towns the duties of compounder could be discharged by those attached to dispensaries, but that clerks would be required to maintain records ; chaprss and khalsis would however not be required. Equipment. Camp equipage. 64.    As operators would have to work in rural areas often far from any accommodation suitable for Europeans and often too among plague-infected villages, it was considered necessary to provide every officer and his establishment with tents and camp equipage, this including in the case of officers both tents and funiture, and in the case of the medical practitioners whom it was proposed to obtain from England with cooking utensils, crockery, cutlery, glasses and table linen. Apparatus. In order to permit of the inoculation of large numbers of persons   quickly  as   well   as safely, it was considered necessary to make the equipment of each inoculator as complete as possible, and as they in rural areas would be constantly travelling, it was necessary that this equipment should be strong and compact. Thus, it may be mentioned here, it was thought necessary to provide each operator with five inoculation syringes and to have them with all other instruments all packed in specially made boxes. The cost of the undertaking. 65.    It will not be  necessary   in   this  report to   do more   than   refer to  the   main heads of expenditure for which it was neces- sary to estimate in connection with the scheme of inoculation operations, and it may be stated here that it was not intended that the scheme should be accompanied by any diminished attention to other measures for dealing with plague ; moreover, as even without any special arrangements it was to be expected that considerable expenditure would be incurred on inoculation in the ensuing cold weather, the estimated amount of this expenditure should be deducted in calculating the extra cost of the proposed scheme.
?41 The total cost of the scheme was estimated to be Rs. 8,64,000, of which Rs. 28,300 would probably be expended in any case, leaving the extra expenditure on account of the inoculation scheme at Rs. 5,81,000 as shown below :- On account of                                                  Total expenditure involved in scheme now put forward.

Communication with the Government of India. 66. The Government of India were accordingly addressed on June 30th, 1902, in a letter in which after the reasons for passing the scheme and the arrangements for carrying it out and the expenditure involved had been dealt with at length, the approval of the Government of India was solicited, and the assistance necessary for carrying it into execu- tion asked for. The Government of India was further asked to depute 6 extra I. M. S. officers to the Punjab for seven months and to obtain from England the 37 medical men required in time to begin work on September Ist, 1902. The Government of India replied to the letter on August Ist, approving the scheme and sanctioning the necessary assignment. They also informed the Punjab Government that the Secretary of State had been asked by telegram to send out by September Ist the 37 Medical Officers required, and that arrangements should be made for the deputation for seven months from the same date of the 5 extra officers of the I. M. S. asked for. Before replying officially the Government of India had indicated that the pro- posals of the Punjab Government would most probably be accepted, and intimation to this effect was sent to the Director-in-Chief, Plague Research Laboratory, as early as July 12th, in order to enable him to commence his arrangements for the supply of prophylactic, and on July 14th he was able to state that the matter of flasks would apparently be settled satisfactorily. It will be remembered that the ability of the Laboratory to meet the requirements of the Punjab had been stated to be dependent only upon the supply of the necessary number of flasks, and on the receipt of this assurance, which was confirmed shortly afterwards by Mr. Haffkine, who wrote acknowledging a telegram informing him that the scheme had been sanctioned, the Punjab Government was abled to make arrangements for the carry- ing of the   scheme into execution. Commencement of preparations. 67.  Deputy Commissioners of all districts in which it was contemplated to carry out inoculation on a large scale were immediatlely addressed. They were supplied with details of the scheme, and while they were asked to do all in their power to ensure the success of the scheme, it was enjoined upon them that compulsion was in no case to be used to induce the people to be inoculated.
?42 Arrangements were made for the deputation to infected districts of Assistant Com- missioners and Extra Assistant Commissioners to preach inoculation. It became evident from the reports of these officers that the people would not accept inoculation while the weather continued very hot, and partly for this reason and partly because of the difficulty to be noticed presently in obtaining prophylactic apparatus and equipment it was decided not to commence inoculation operations on a large scale until the begin- ning of October. Supplies. 68.    Matters were at once set in hand for the collection of the necessary supplies In order to  obtain   the  required  number of tents every tent manufacturer in Upper India had to be addressed, as on account of the demands made upon them on account of the approaching Delhi Darbr several firms were unable to accept any further orders. Most of the larger tents required were soon received, though the full complement was not obtained until after the Darbr. The difficulty, it may be mentioned here, was to a great extent got over by the use, when possible, of bungalows and rest-houses, and, when these were not available, of district tents. Camp furniture was obtained from several towns in the Punjab, most of it having been made to order in Lahore. Cooking utensils, crockery, glasses, table-linen, lamps, &c., for the 36 European medical practitioners working in rural areas were chiefly obtained from Calcutta ; special boxes, one for cooking utensils, the other for crockery, etc., were made at Jullundur. Boxes were made to contain all the equipment required by an inoculator, and in order to provide for the requirements of Missionaries and others who might desire to carry out inoculations one hundred of the boxes were fully equipped. The contents of the boxes will be found in Appendix No. III.* It will there be seen that they contained not only the instruments, etc., necessary for the actual performance of the operation of inoculation, but the materials for maintaining records and for carrying correspondence. With each box was supplied a small folding table and chair for use by operators when inoculating. A perusal of the list will show that in addition to the five syringes supplied to each operator spare parts were issued in order to permit of the repair on the spot of syringes which might become damaged or broken. 80 The decision as to the equipment necessary was the outcome of the experience gained during the extensive inoculations in the Jullundur and Hoshirpur Districts performed during the hot weather of  1900, and the object aimed  at was  the  prevention  of delays for want of apparatus. Attention may here be called to the  inoculating stamps and to  the arrangements for obtaining duplicates  of inoculation certificates. These stamps, of one of which an impression is given in the mar- gin, were issued in order to enable in- oculators to comply with the instructions which will be found in Appendix III. It was neces- sary that each inoculator should keep the stamp himself, not let it get into the hands of others, and hence it was desirable that it should be small enough to go into the waist-coat pocket. A portable stamp, which with its case was smaller than an ordinary watch, was designed by Captain C. H. James, I. M. S. As will be seen on reference to Appendix No. III, it was considered desirable to let each person bring his or her inoculation certificate at the time of the operation. This could only be accomplished by some duplicating process. The ordinary method of inserting a piece of carbon paper between the original and the copy would necessitate the use of very thin paper for the inoculation certificates, and this would render them too easily torn to be serviceable. Moreover, when working under great pressure, as it was expected would very frequently be the case, the insertion of a piece of carbon paper between each certificate and its duplicate would cause much difficulty and delay. A plan was therefore devised by which to the back of each certificate form was gummed by a corner only a piece of tissue paper so thin as to be easily transparent. Tablets of soft wood, a little bigger than the certificate, with one surface smoothed, were provided, with a special duplicating composition to be smeared as required on the smooth surface of the tablet. In writing out the certificates the form with its attached slip of tissue paper was laid upon the tablet and entries made with a hard pencil; the entries were thus reproduced on the back of the tissue paper, but this being very thin the writing could be read through it As it was not necessary to keep the duplicates after the entries had been copied in a register, usually within a few hours, there was not the same objection to the perishable nature of the duplicates as in the case of the certificates. Some difficulty was experienced in obtaining a sufficient quantity of suitable tissue paper; most of it had to be got from England. Inoculation syringes and spare parts were supplied by the Plague Research Laboratory and were of the pattern made specially by Colin of Paris. Each was of the capacity of 20 c. c. * Page lvii.

The officers of the Indian Medical Service deputed for the scheme reported themselves early in September, and in the same month the medical practitioners who had been engaged in England arrived at Bombay and were instructed to attend at the Plague Research Laboratory, the authorities of which in response to the request of the Punjab Government afforded them facilities for acquainting themselves with the method in which the prophylactic was prepared. The desirability of all these practitioners themselves submitting to inoculation was pointed out, and most of them availed themselves of the opportunity afforded by their attend- ance at the Laboratory to be inoculated. All these officers were directed to report themselves at Ambala, where most of them arrived about the middle of September and were given orders to proceed to their districts in which they would be required to work. Plague Manual. 70. A special manual was drawn up, in which after a review of the course of plague in the Punjab detailed instructions were given on the various heads required, for example, the preaching of inoculation, the manner of performing the operation and the method of obtaining statistics and maintaining records. As it was considered very desirable to obtain as correct statistics as possible of the value of inoculation, elaborate instructions were issued on this point. Extracts from the Plague Manual containing most of the instructions are reproduced as an appendix (No. III) to this report. Establishment. 71. Meanwhile clerks, Compounders and other establishment had been got together. and all staff and establishment were ready by the end of September.
44 Prophylactic. 72.    The European Medical Practitioners were met at Ambala on September 18th, 1002, by  representatives    of  the   Punjab   Govern- ment.    When    speaking     of    their  own   in- oculation certain of them mentioned that they had received doses of only I C. C. of the prophy- lactic, and on it being remarked that I. c. c. was a very small dose, they replied that the method of preparing the prophylactic had lately been changed, so that instead of being 5 c. c or more as formerly the dose was only 5 or I c. c. This was the first intimation which had reached the Punjab of any change connected with the prophylactic. A telegram was there- fore immediately despatched to the Director-in-Chief, Plague Research Laboratory, en- quiring if it was true that the method of preparing the prophylactic had been changed, and asking for particulars of any change that might have been made. Just after the telegram was despatched a letter was received from the Superintendent of the Plague Research Laboratory confirming the statements of the European Medical Practitioners as to the change in the method of preparing the prophylactic, and adding that the Laboratory  could only  supply  the Punjab   with   15,000  doses daily from   October 1st. In reply to the telegram just referred to the Director-in-Chief, Plague Research Laboratory, telegraphed inviting reference to a letter of his' published in the report of the Indian Plague Commission and stating that modifications were being introduced on the lines therein sketched. Reference was also invited to the Superintendent's letter mentioned above, Without going into details it may be stated here that modifications in the prophylac- tic affected both the method of its manufacture and its composition. The change in the method of manufacture involved more manipulation and hence more danger of contamination, and the change in the composition of the prophylactic, although of a similar nature to that recommended by the Indian Plague Commission, was in opposition to the views of Mr. Haffkine himself expressed before the Commission several months after the date of his letter to which he had invited reference. In preparing its scheme of extensive inoculation operations the Punjab Government had contemplated the use only of prophylactic exactly similar to that the efficacy and harmless- ness of which had been demonstrated by its extensive use in the Province for several years, but for which experience, indeed, its scheme would never have been formulated. The receipt immediately before the commencement of its great undertaking of the information that the prophylactic to be supplied for the inoculation of several millions of its dependents was to differ in important respects from that previously used was a matter of the greatest concern to the Punjab Government, outweighing in its seriousness the information recorded at the same time of the great deficiency in" the amount of the  fluid which could be supplied. It was felt that however beneficial the results of the changes connected with prophy- lactic might be expected to be, the occasion of the introduction was the most inopportune that could have been chosen. The scheme of the Punjab Government had for its chief support the experience of several years of a fluid which, whatever theoretical objections could be urged against it, had been proved to be safe and efficacious, and it is hardly necessary to state that in such a matter as the protection of millions of human beings from plague by inoculating them with a fluid requiring for its preparation the most delicate bacteriological manipulations no expected advantages which had only theoretical considerations in their support could com- pensate for the loss of a confidence based upon the experiences of years.  To abandon the scheme when all preparations for undertaking it had been completed and great expense had been incurred and to deprive the people of the Punjab of a measure which had been promised them to protect them from the ravages of plague was a course which could not be entertained except for the very strongest reasons : at the same time it be- came incumbent upon the Punjab Government to assure itself as far as possible that the new fluid prepared by the Plague Research Laboratory was likely to be not only effective but safe to use, and that a sufficient supply would be forthcoming to permit of the scheme being proceeded with. After informal consultation with the Government of India it was decided to depute the Chief Plague Medical Officer to Bombay to enquire into the matter, and this officer after careful enquiry at the Plague Research Laboratory reported on October 2nd that although in his opinion the changes in the fluid were very considerable, its use might be adopted solely on the responsibility of Mr. Haffkine as to its efficacy and harmlessness. He further reported that owing to the changes which had been introduced in the method of preparing the fluid a large amount of it became contaminated- and had therefore to be re- jected, and for this reason the authorities of the Laboratory were unable to guarantee a supply of over more than 10,000 doses daily at first, though they were nearly confident of being able to supply 20,000 doses daily during November and of being ultimately able to send out 70,000 doses daily, though they could not fix a date on which the last named amount would be reached. Commencement of operations. 73.    With the short supply of fluid it was  only possible  to commence operations on a small  scale,  and   it  was  decided to restrict inoculation  at  first to those districts in which plague had been previously most severe  and  to those  persons who expressed a real desire for the operation.
?45 The authorities of the Plague Research Laboratory were therefore asked to distribute the available supply as follows:-1,000 doses daily to each of the districts of Jullundur, Hoshirpur, Gurdspur, Silkot, Lahore and Ambala; 750 doses daily to Ludhina ; 500 doses daily to Ferozepore and Amritsar ; and 2,250 doses to the Central Disinfection Dept, Jullundur. The last supply was intended to be distributed to meet the demands of districts other than those named above. Afterwards all prophylactic was sent to the Central Disinfection Dept upon which District Plague Medical Officers indented for supplies. The necessity of deputing the Chief Plague Medical Officer to Bombay rendered it impossible for him to superintend the final preparation of the scheme and the commencement of operations. There was thus some delay in the distribution of forms necessary for the preparation of statistics concerning plague occurrences and inoculations. The responsibility of starting operations had to be left largely to officers who had had no previous experience of such work. This latter difficulty was partly overcome by the appointment of Major James, I. M. S., as Inspecting Inoculation Officer, but it naturally took some time for him to visit every District Plague Medical Officer. The first supply of prophylactic was received from Bombay towards the end of September. There was also a small stock of prophylactic prepared by the original method in some districts and this was also brought into use. Course of operations. September. 74.    During September 24,268 persons   were  inoculated, their   distribution  by dis- tricts being as follows :-Jullundur 1,091, Hoshirpur 636, Gurdspur 654, Silkot 1,909, Ludhina    1,064,   Lahore 6, Ambala 10,330, Shahpur 8, Ferozepore 7,523, Gujrnwla 759, Amritsar 91, Gujrt 137 and Simla 50. These inoculations, although not performed during the year 1902-03, are "mentioned here as they formed part of those carried out in connection with the operations under report. October. 75.    During October 111,337 persons were inoculated and the prospects of the people availing themselves so largely of the operation as to make the scheme a success appeared most promising. Contaminated prophylactic. 76.    Towards the end of this month  however  circumstances occurred which threw some doubt on the purity of the prophylactic and very strict orders were issued that the  contents of each bottle of prophylactic should be carefully examined by the operator himself before he took it into use. Soon after the issue of these orders reports were received from the several districts which left no room for doubt that a considerable quantity of the prophylactic was contaminated, and in view of the extreme danger of using fluid of which the purity could be guaranteed the Director-in-Chief, Plague Research Laboratory, was asked by telegram on October 30th to discontinue the supply to the Punjab of the fluid as then prepared. A request was made at the same time that the original method of preparing the prophylactic might be immediately reverted to. Orders were issued directing the practical suspension of inocula- tion in those districts in which the demand for it was least and the withdrawal from every district of all fluid prepared by the new process. District Plague Medical Officers were instructed to retain for use only prophylactic prepared by the original method and to send all fluid prepared by the process to the Central Disinfection Depot, and in view of the fact that but a small quantity of such fluid was available, it was arranged that all prophylactic pre- pared by the original process should be reserved for use in districts in which there was a demand for inoculation. The Mulkowl accident. 77.  Before the orders recalling the new fluid had time to take effect a terrible accident occurred. On the morning of November 6th several persons, who had been inoculated on Octo- ber 30th, were found to be suffering from tetanus under circumstances that left no room for doubt that their illness was directly due to their having been inoculated. As soon as news of this disaster reached Government, orders were issued for the immediate and complete cessation of inoculation throughout the Punjab. The particulars of the accident above referred to are as follows :- On October 30th Dr. Elliot, one of the European Medical Practitioners, visited Mulkowl, a small village of some 400 inhabitants, about four miles from Gujrt, some of the people of which had expressed their willingness to be inoculated. In order to re-assure some persons who had doubts as to the safety of the operation Dr. Elliot offered to inoculate himself first and bared his arm for the purpose. The people, however, said they did not need this demonstration and a number of them came forward of whom 100 were inocu- lated.
?46 The first 19 were all inoculated with fluid from one bottle, No. 53 N, the only one of that number in Dr. Elliot's possession. Very careful enquiries made shortly afterwards proved that while no body, who had been inoculated with any other brew, suffered any ill-effects, every person who had been inoculated with fluid from this bottle died of tetanus. The enquiries also showed that Dr. Elliot had taken every precaution in performing the operations and there was no room for doubt that although to all appearance pure, the fluid had been con- taminated with the virus of tetanus. As soon as the news of the outbreak of tetanus reached the District Plague Medical Officer, Gujrt, which it did on the morning of November 6th, he and Dr. Elliot went to Mulkowl and did all that was possible for the unfortunate sufferers, but to no avail. Dr. Elliot remained at the village almost continuously until the last patient died and did much to convince the people that the terrible calamity was the result of an accident only and to prevent any outburst of feeling against Government. The people of Mulkowl bore their terrible misfortune with great fortitude, though a few were so affected by watching the sufferings of their relatives who died of tetanus that they imagined that they themselves had contracted the disease of the symptoms of which they manifested hysterical imitations for some time. It so happened that all the sufferers were males, most of them being the bread-winners of their households, and in order to afford their dependents some compensation for their loss the Punjab Government awarded a number of these dependents pensions of various amounts according to various status and circumstances of each family. One of the victims was a Lambardr, and a grant of land on the Jhelum Canal was awarded in lieu of a pension to his family. A commission was appointed in January 1903 to enquire into the circumstances connected with the Mulkowl accident, the report of which has not yet been published. With the occurrence of the Mulkowl disaster and the consequent complete suspen- sion of operations the inoculation scheme of the Punjab Government may be considered to have received its death-blow. It was of course realised that the temporary abandonment of the scheme for extensive inoculation could not fail to shake the confidence of the people in the measure, but the danger of another such calamity as that which had occurred at Mulkowl was too great to be faced. Had the accident occurred with the original prophylactic it might have been possible in view of previous experience of its purity to disregard this danger and to go on with the scheme, but after so much of the new fluid had been proved to be con- taminated there was no alternative but to cease operations completely as long as there was any possibility of any of this fluid being taken into use. Resumption of operations. 78.    As soon as it became certain that no new fluid remained in any district permis- sion was given for the resumption of inoculation with such of the original  prophylactic as  was still in the Punjab pending the receipt of a further supply of this prophylactic. As, however, it was anticipated that the supply of fluid prepared by this process could not be obtained until January instructions were issued directing special attention to other measures for deal- ing with plague. District Plague Medical Officers were instructed to arrange in consultation with Deputy Commissioners for all Medical Officers in their districts to work in those tahsls in which they would be consequently employed on inoculation duty, in order that they might become familiar with that part of the district and endeavour to obtain the confidence of its inhabitants. The necessity was impressed upon all District Plague Medical Officers of bringing to light all defects and deficiencies in equipment and for seeing that everybody was thorough- ly instructed in his duties, in order that when it was possible to re-commence inoculation on a large scale, everybody and everything might be in readiness. In the meanwhile not only the people but many officials became distrusted of inocu- lation. It was common to find officials, who had formerly earnestly advocated the measure, declare that they could no longer do so, now they themselves so distrusted it that they would not consent to submit to the operation. It was thus that even after a supply of prophylactic prepared by the original method and subjected to additional tests as to its purity was obtained, it was only in those districts of which the officials enjoyed in an excep- tional degree the confidence of the people or had managed to re-assure themselves of the safety of the prophylactic that the people came forward at all freely for inoculation. In no district, however, did the number of inoculations performed approach the number estimated, and in no large town were more than a few hundred people inoculated. It was in the towns that the news of the Mulkowl accident produced the greatest distrust of inoculation as it was here that papers were most read and the manner in which the Mulkowl accident was referred to by some of the native papers was the reverse of that calculated to re-assure the public as to the safety of inoculation.
?47 Deputation of Punjab officials to the Plague Research Laboratory. 79.    In consequence of presentations made by the  Director-in-Chief of the Plague Research Laboratory and in compliance with the request of the Government of India a deputation from the Punjab Government con- sisting of the Judicial and General Secretary, the Chief Plague Medical Officer and the Inspecting Inoculation Officer visited the Plague Research Laboratory towards the end of November. As the result of its enquiries, the deputation drew up a memorandum regarding the prophylactic which it was considered desirable to use and the conditions under which it might be accepted. The recommendations in this memorandum were to the effect that only such prophylactic should be used as was prepared in accordance with the method adopted, for the preparation of the fluid which had been supplied to the Punjab in previous years that this fluid should be standardised in a particular manner, and that certain additional tests and precautions should be taken to ensure the issue of only such fluid as was perfectly safe to use. The Punjab Government accepted the recommendations of this deputation and issued instructions accordingly. Testing of prophylactic in the Punjab. 80.    As an additional precaution it was  decided to test in the  Punjab samples of each brew before any of it was issued for use. Captain Harvey, I. M. S., Officiating Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Punjab, was accordingly deputed to perform this duty at the Central Disinfection Dept. A report on the testing of the prophylactic work has already been furnished to Government. It may be stated here that the laboratory for testing prophylactic was opened on 8th December 1902 and was closed on 27th of April 1903. During this period 6,342 brews containing 2,014,946 doses were examined, of which all but 15 brews containing 5,238 doses were found to be sterile. Of these latter 6 brews were rejected as being of doubtful purity and 9 because they were considered to be contaminated. In addition to testing brews received from the Plague Research Laboratory, Captain Harvey also tested the contents of several bottles of prophylactic which were rejected by inoculating officers on account of unusual appearance of the fluid or for some other reasons. The number of such bottles tested was 236: all were found sterile. Progress of operations. November.   81.    It would appear from the statements furnished  with this report that a con- siderable number of inoculations had been per- formed in November before the orders first for the restriction and afterwards for  the entire cessation of inoculation had time to take effect. It should be explained, however, that these statements are compiled from returns which showed for any given day, not the inoculations which were performed on that day, but those information concerning which reached the compiling officer on the date in question. Thus a number of the inoculations which are included in the returns for November were per- formed during the last few days of October, and so on. It naturally took some time for orders to reach officers in out-of-the way part of districts beyond the reach of  the telegraph. Only 9 inoculations were reported during the week ending November 22nd,  all of which were performed in the Jullundur District. December. 82.    During December 1902 onlyold stocks of prophylactic were available, and only 188,990 persons were inoculated. Some 40,000 doses of prophylactic prepared by the original process were received from the Plague Research Laboratory during this month, but as it had to be tested before issue it was not brought into use until the following month. January Mulkowl Commission. 83. In the early part of January 1903 inoculation operations were somewhat interfered with by the withdrawal of several inoculating officers from their work in order to give evidence before the Commission previously mentioned appointed to enquire into the circumstances which led to the Mulkowl disaster. The Commission sat for six days at Jullundur and examined 21 witnesses. In spite of this interruption, however, the number of inoculations performed during January amounted to 77,110, of which 40,954 were performed in the Hoshirpur District alone. February. Discontinuance of supply of prophylactic. 84.    It was in  February that the  extent of inoculation operations approached most nearly to that attained during October.  Plague began to spread rapidly and the people were not at this time so fully occupied in agricultural operation as to be unable to spare time to be inoculated.
?48 It was during this month also that the authorities of the Plague Research Laboratory were able to fulfil their promise of supplying 70,000 doses of prophylactic daily; from February onwards the daily supply actually reached this amount. As, however, it was evi- dent that so large a quantity would not be required, the Laboratory authorities were asked to discontinue supplies from the end of this month. The total number of doses of prophylactic received in the Punjab between September 1902 and February 1903 in connection with the inoculation scheme was 1,681,717. Of these 160,091 doses were of fluid prepared by the new process and were received between September 28th and October 29th, and 1,521,626 doses were of the original fluid and were received between December 2nd and February 16th. March- April. 85.    It was hoped that with the great spread of plague that was anticipated in March and April the people would avail themselves more freely of the facility for inoculation afforded them. This hope was not realised, however, for, though the anticipated increase of plague occurred, in neither of these months was the number of persons inoculated as great as during February. The number of inoculations reported in March was 79,642 and in April 51,516. This result was chiefly due to the people being busy with the harvest, and it can be under- stood that in badly-infected districts where many workers were sick or dead of plague the work of gathering of the harvest fell all the harder upon the remainders who thus were unable to spare any time for inoculation. End of operations. 86.    During May the inoculation operations may be considered to have come to an end. Only 11,134 persons were inoculated dur- ing this month, and the engagements of all the European Medical Practitioners engaged for the scheme terminated. Statistics. 87.    Between the beginning of October 1902 and the end of May 1903, 481,130 per- sons were inoculated in the Punjab. It has been seen that a certain amount of prophylactic prepared in connection with the inoculation scheme was received in the Punjab during September and that a number of persons were inoculated in this month. This number was 24,268, and it should properly be included in the total number of persons inoculated in connection with the inoculation scheme.    If this is done this total amounts to 505,398. In Statement No. 11 (in Appendix IV) the number of inoculations performed by each operator weekly from the beginning of October 1902 to the end of May 1903 is detailed, and in Table No. 1 below the work done by each class of Medical Officers is shewn :- Table No. 1 showing the number of Inoculations performed by each class of Medical Officers employed in the Punjab during the year 1902-03.

?49 Between June and September 1903, only 451 inoculations were performed in the Punjab, the total number of inoculations performed during the year under report thus amounting to 481,581. It has been seen that the number of inoculations which it was ex- pected that each full-time operator would perform daily was 700, but though this figure was occasionally exceeded by individual operators, in no case did the daily average number of persons inoculated by any one officer exceed 232. The highest number of inoculations per- formed by any officer in one week was 3,733, which number was attained by Dr. Michell in the Hoshirpur District in April. The highest number of inoculations performed by all operators in any one week was 37,977. This figure was reached in the week ending October 25th. It was in the following week that orders were first issued restricting in- oculation operations and in the next succeeding week that the entire cessation of these operations was directed. In no week after orders were issued restricting operations did the number of persons inoculated reached to within 10,000 of the figure just mentioned. After the recommencement of operations the highest number of persons inoculated in any one week was 27,455 : this was during the week ending February 28th. As has been seen, the monthly total of inoculations was largest in October 1902, when it reached 111,337. In only one other month, namely, February 1903, did the monthly total reached a lakh ; during this month the number of persons inoculated was 103,283. In seven of the thirteen districts included in the scheme the highest monthly totals were reached in October, and in only two districts, namely, Hoshirpur and Amritsar, were the totals for this month largely exceeded. In the Amritsar District the number of persons inoculated in October was only 2,106, this being chiefly due to the circumstances previously mentioned that the available supply of prophylactic was chiefly reserved for those districts in which the demand for inoculation was expected to be greatest, and Amritsar was not one of these. The highest monthly total of the district was only 14,862, this figure having been reached in February, In this month 44,931 inoculations were performed in the Hoshirpur District, this being the highest monthly total of any district. The district in which the largest number of inoculations was performed was Hoshirpur where 158,550 persons were inoculated, next came Jullundur with 82,097 inoculations, then Amritsar and Ambala with 62,775 and 60,716 inoculations, respectively. In only two other districts, namely, Gurdspur and Ferozepore, did the number of inoculations performed exceed 20,000, and in but four others were more than 10,000 persons inoculated. Particulars will be found in Statement No. 2 in which are shewn the numbers of plague cases and deaths and inoculations in each district monthly throughout the year under report. Effects. Results. 88. It remains to consider the immediate effects of inoculation, that is, the reaction of the operation and any injury apparently due to it, and the result  of measure as shewn by a com- parison of plague cases and deaths occurring among inoculated and uninoculated persons. It should be premised that all inoculating officers were instructed to observe and record the reaction following inoculation in as large a number of persons as possible and were .enjoined to report particulars of all cases in which any injury was observed to follow the operation. The results of inoculation in protecting from attacks of, and deaths from, plague have been ascertained from the records of plague occurrences and inoculations maintained in accordance with the instructions in the Plague Manual and from special enquiries. Effects of the operation. Temperature. 89.    Whenever possible the effects and results of the old and new  prophylactic have- been shewn separately.  In Table No. 2 below are  shewn the body temperature observed at various periods after inoculation, with the old and new fluid respectively. All inoculating officers were provided with reliable minute or half-minute clinical thermometers and the axillary temperature was observed in almost all instances. It will be noticed that subnormal temperatures were recorded at all periods of inoculations both with the old and the new fluid. It was first thought that such observations were erroneous, but the enquiries which were made which showed that although this might be the case in some instances, most were correct. If the temperature reaction is any indication of the efficacy of inoculation, it would appear from effects recorded in this table that while neither the old nor the new fluid reached the desired standard, activity of the latter was much less than that of the former as judged by its failure to produce either any reaction or a rise of temperature to 101. The failure to produce this temperature was more marked in the case of new than of the old fluid at all periods after inoculations.

?51 Ill-effects. 90.    In addition to the cases of tetanus already mentioned the only ill-effects following inoculation, which  could be directly referred to the operation, were certain abscesses. Besides these, 9 deaths from plague and 1 from tetanus were reported to have followed closely upon the inoculation of the patients. Investigation showed, however, that in no instance could inoculation be held responsible for the illness and death of these persons. The cases of plague were without exception found to have contracted the disease before inoculation. The person who died of tetanus had slight fever at the time of inoculation and lived in a house in which another person had recently died of this disease. Inoculation had been carefully performed and none of the number of other persons, who were inoculated at the same time with the same brew, suffered any ill-effects. Thirty-seven cases of abscess at the seat of inoculation were reported. Thirty of the patients had been inoculated with the new fluid and 7 with the old. Of the former 23 were inoculated in the Hoshirpur District, 6 on October 21st, 1902, with fluid of one brew, 3 on October 22nd, with fluid of another brew, and 14 on Nov- ember 1st, with fluid of a third brew. In no other instance was inoculation with fluid of a particular brew followed by abscesses in a group of persons. There is no reason for believing that the other abscesses reported were the direct result of inoculation: it is at least as likely that they were due to infection of the inoculation puncture subsequently to the Operation. Two persons suffering from tuberculosis who were inoculated experienced a tem- porary exacerbation symptoms of the disease as the effect of the operation. Results of the measure. 91.    In considering results of inoculation as indicated by a comparison of the incidence of plague among inoculated and uninoculated persons there are two points which must be borne in mind. The first is that unless the populations under consideration were similarly circumstanced as regards the exposure to the infection of plague the comparison will be of little or no value. The second point to be remembered is that in some districts-as for ex- ample those of Jullundur, Hoshirpur Gurdspur, Silkot, Ludhina and Ambala,-which have been previously visited by severe epidemics of plague, the number of persons who have suffered from plague forms an appreciable portion of the population. Such persons, it may be safely asserted, were not inoculated, and as they had acquired an immunity from attacks of plague the inclusion of their number among that of uninoculated persons tends to obscure the benefits of inoculation as judged by comparison of the incidence of plague upon the inoculated and uninoculated communities. In order to eliminate as far as possible the errors arising from the first of the two, considerations mentioned above the following method has been adopted for comparing the incidence of plague among inoculated and uninoculated persons. Village statistics. 92.    The statistics of only those villages have been considered in which not less  than 10 per cent. of the inhabitants were inoculated prior to, or during an, outbreak of plague and in which such outbreaks occurred not later than four months after the performance of inoculation. Statements have been prepared for each village in which these conditions existed, showing its populations according to the Census of 1901, the dates on which inoculations were performed, and the number of persons inoculated on each date as well as the number of attacks and deaths among inoculated and uninoculated persons daily throughout the epidemic. The average population of each class present has been calculated from the data thus afforded, and the incidence of plague attacks and deaths upon this population has been worked out, as well as the fatality of the attacks among the two classes. From  the village statistics similar statements were prepared for tahsls and these have been embodied in Table No. 3 below.

53 The results thus arrived at cannot be considered as absolutely correct. It will be evident, for instance, that the population of a village may not have been the same during the outbreak of plague as it was at the census taken in March 1901. At the same time there is no reason for thinking that such differences as may have occurred were very great, or for doubting the substantial accuracy of the conclusions arrived at by the method described above. A reference to the table will show that, although the results of inoculation as judged by this method varied in different areas, the inoculated were everywhere much better off than the uninoculated as regards their liability both to attacks of plague and to deaths when so attacked. Taking the figures for the Province as a whole the liability of the uninoculated to attacks of plague was four times as great as that of the inoculated, while the latter were nearly twelve times better off than the former as regards their liability to deaths from plague. The provincial figures in the table may be compared with the similar figures given in the Statement No. 1 (in Appendix I), in which are given by tahsls the incidence and fatality of plague upon the total population, inoculated and uninoculated, of all infected districts. Even here, where the comparison of the incidence of plague attacks among the two classes is unfavourably influenced as concerns the inoculated by the inclusion among the numbers upon which the incidence of plague among the uninoculated is calculated of the population of several towns and areas in which only small isolated outbreaks occurred, the inoculated are shewn to be considerably better off than the uninoculated. It will be noticed that the difference between the fatality of attacks among the two classes is nearly the same in both Table No. 3 and Statement No. 1. Household statistics. 93.    In order to further eliminate any error due to the difference in the extent of ex- posure to infection of the two classes, officers on plague duty were asked to investigate the conditions as to the incidence of plague attacks and deaths upon as many infected house- holds as possible. The results of these investigations are embodied in Table No. 4 below. Enquiries were made in the cases of 1,341 houses with a population of 7,077, of which 1,543 persons were inoculated and 5,534 uninoculated. Among the former 135 attacks of plague with 49 deaths occurred and among the latter 744 attacks with 413 deaths. The percentage incidence among the inoculated was 874 and among the uninoculated 1345. Among the inoculated 3630 and among the uninoculated 5551 per cent. of the attacks proved fatal. The table gives particulars concerning males and females of both classes, and it will be noticed that inoculated females are shewn to be rather less favourably situated as regards their liability to attack than uninoculated females. It should be stated however that among the number shewn as inoculated are included several whose attacks of plague com- menced within a few days of inoculation and who had probably contracted the disease before they had been protected by the operation

?55 It would seem from the figures in Table No. 5 below that the protection afforded by inoculation increases up to the third week following the Operation, and that it remains fairly constant for a period of at least four months, and that even beyond this period the fata- lity of attacks among the inoculated is very much less than among the uninoculated.

The experience of the year under report does but confirm previous experi- ence of the value of inoculation as a measure of diminishing the incidence of mortality from plague. It is only fair to conclude that had inoculation been as Widely accepted as before the calamitious accident at Malkowl there was every reason to hope that the Punjab would have suffered far less from the ravages of plague than it did during the epidemic under report. HISSAR DISTRICT. 95 The people had an absolute terror of inoculation. Only 41 in all were done and these by a lady missionary doctor at Bhiwani.
?56 GURGAON   DISTRICT. 96. From the very beginning of the present plague season  the  people of the Gurgaon District  were  strongly opposed to inoculation and consequently only 1,116 operations were performed in the district; but later on many of the influential  people admitted the operation to be protective, and Mr. Charters, the Civil Surgeon of the district, remarks in his report that, as the harmlessness of the operation  has been demonstrated to the people, they may be more ready to accept it next year. KARNAL DISTRICT. The people of the Karnl District were afraid of inoculation and only 2,879 opera- tions were done. The District Plague Medical Officer states that this attitude of the people was due to the fact that some persons who had been inoculated during the previous season contracted plague. AMBALA DISTRICT. 97.    Except in the Jagdhri Tahsl, where the people were averse to the operation from the outstart, inoculation was freely  accepted in the beginning  of the season in the Ambala District, and in October 1902  17,132 operations were performed. The Malkowl accident affected only the big towns, the villages were not in- fluenced by it, and consequently on reassumption of the work a large number of persons, amounting to 10,830 and 10,794, was, respectively, inoculated during January and February, but the work declined from March onwards. Altogether 60,716 operations were per- formed in the district during the year under report. HOSHIARPUR DISTRICT. 98.    It is unfortunate that the report on the inoculation   operations in the Hoshirpur District, in which the largest measure of success was obtained, was not written by the Medical Officer in charge of these operations. The number of inoculations performed in the district between October 1902 and April 1903 is 158,550, nearly twice as great as that of the inoculations performed in any other district,-the Jullundur District coming next with about 82,000 inoculations. It amounts to about one-sixth of the population of the entire district, and is therefore just a quarter of number which it was hoped to reach. In the Garhshankar Tahsl about 1 person of every 4, and in the Hoshirpur Tahsl about 1 in every 5 of the population, was inoculated. The success which attended the operation in the Hoshirpur District was, apart from the strenuous manner in which all the Inoculating Medical Officers devoted them- selves to the work, in a great measure due to the active interest displayed by Mr Fagan, the Deputy Commissioner, and to the confidence reposed in him by the people ; and it can hardly be doubted that but for the temporary cessation of inoculation necessitated by cir- cumstances mentioned elsewhere in the report the number of persons inoculated would have been fully equal to the estimate. In spite of the serious deficiency in prophylactic and the difficulties incident to starting extensive operations of the nature, nearly 30,000 persons were inoculated in the Hoshiarpur District before operations were temporarily suspended. As soon as a new supply of prophylactic was obtained in January 1903, inoculation was vigorously pressed and 40,984 persons were inoculated during the month. In February this total was exceeded, the monthly total reaching 44931, the largest of any district. The weekly totals of inoculation in the district during this month were respec- tively 14,721, 8,505, 10,428 and 11,277, all except the lowest of these being more than double the total number of inoculations performed during week in any other district. In March the number of persons coming forward for inoculation began to decline, the decline being continued in April on account of the people being fully occupied in harvesting. No inocula- tions were performed after the end of April, and most of the Inoculating Medical Officers left early in May. Dr. Datta, who writes the report on the inoculation in the Hoshirpur District and who is in touch with native opinion, remarks that the Malkowal accident prejudiced
?57  inoculation among the educated classes, who after it preferred not to run any similar risk, and that their example had a considerable effect in checking the acceptance of inoculation by the rural population. The arrangements made in the Hoshirpur District were that Inoculating Officers were posted to certain areas, several of which were in charge of one Executive Plague Officer who arranged for the inoculation of different villages. Usually several visits were made to villages, inoculators working backwards and forwards over a limited area, though the applications of particular villagers for inoculation were responded to as much as possible, especially those of infected villages. Inoculation was most freely accepted in those parts of the district in which the people were familiar with it, for example the Garhshankar Tahsl, and except in the Una Tahsl, in which there was comparatively little plague or inoculation, inoculations were far numerous in infected than in uninfected villages. JULLENDER DISTRICT. 99. Captain Scott-Moncrieff, who was the District Plague Medical Officer of the Jullundur District, reports that in spite of certain difficulties at first experienced inoculation operations in this district started well. At first it was decided to work from three centres, Banga in the Nawashahr Tahsl, Phillour and Nakodar. At Banga three European Medical Practitioners, Drs. Dickson, Gray and Miller, were posted under the direction of Mr. A. F. deMontmorency, Assistant Commissioner. Captain Scott-Moncrieff directed the work in the Phillour circle, to which Drs. Bond and Northcott were posted; while Dr. Karm Singh, who had been in this part of the district for some time and had secured the confidence of the people worked alone in the Nakodar circle. It was hoped that by beginning operations in those parts of the district the people of which were familiar with inoculation large numbers would come forward for the opera- tion with but little persuasion, and that the example thus set would prove useful in other parts of the district. This plan was beginning to work well, especially in the Banga circle, where large numbers of persons were coming forward daily, when orders were received for the sus- pension of inoculation operations. During this period some difficulty was experienced from the want of a second Exe- cutive Plague Officer. Captain Scott-Moncrieff remarks that the Malkowl accident itself made but little impression upon the minds of the people as compared with that produced by the Suspension of inoculation operations, and, although inoculation was again offered to the people in December, it was long after they again began to avail themselves freely of it, not in fact until plague began to be severe. From January when a fresh supply of prophylactic was obtained, the system adopted was for inoculators to visit as many villages as possible with the object of making inocu- lation widely known, as it had been found by experience that although but few persons might come forward for inoculation at the first visit of an operator to a village subsequent visits were attended with more success. This system worked satisfactorily, though no- where did the people come forward as freely as they had done before the break in the operations. Captain Scott-Moncrieff considers that, although the number of inoculations per- formed was not great enough to have any considerable effect in checking the epidemic of plague in the district as a whole, certain villages and tracts in which the operation was largely availed of profited largely by the measure. LUDHIANA DISTRICT. 100.  Very little inoculation was done in the Ludhina District. At first, owing to the limited supply of prophylactic, it was possible to spare but little for this district. The cessation of operations severely affected the confidence both of the people and of the officials in the safety of inoculation, and comparatively few of the former availed themselves of it. One reason for the disinclination of the people of the district to accept inoculation was the much milder epidemic with which they were visited as compared with that of the  previous year.
?58 Only 16,040 persons were inoculated in the Ludhina District during the year under report. All but 58 of these operations were performed between October 1902 and May 1903. FEROZEPORE DISTRICT. 101. Bet few particulars are available concerning the course of the inoculation opera- tion in the Ferozepore District. It is recorded, however, that before the suspension of in- oculation the measure was popular in those parts of the district the inhabitants of which were familiar with it, and that no difficulty was experienced in persuading the people to accept it. Afterwards, however, the same degree of confidence in inoculation was never obtained. While there is little room for doubt that this was the case, it should be pointed out that from the first but a small measure of success was attained in the Ferozepore District, and that the number of persons inoculated in October was not, as in most districts, the highest number inoculated in any month. The maximum monthly total of the Feroze- pore District was recorded in January, during which 7,579 persons were inoculated. From this month onwards the total steadily declined to 833 in May, after which no inoculations were performed in the district. The total number of inoculations performed in the Feroze- pore District was 24,150. SIALKOT DISTRICT. 102. The inoculation operations in the Silkot District were not very successful. Only 13,636 persons were inoculated during the year. This want of success is attributed by Dr. Jones, who was the District Plague Medical Officer from February 1903 onwards, to various circumstances. In the first place, the preaching officers sent to the district were strangers, and did not win the confidence of the people. Following upon this some of the European Medical Practitioners appointed to the district proved unsatisfactory and had to be withdrawn. Only about 5,000 inoculations had thus been performed when the orders suspending operations were received, and the Malkowl mishap, coupled with the suspension of inoculations, so shook the confidence of the people in the measure that they only began to resort to it at all freely towards the end of the season. It was not until March that the number of persons inoculated approached that of October, and in April the decline of plague and the commencement of the harvest made the people disinclined for inoculation. Dr. Jones remarks that in the Silkot District inoculation was chiefly a treatment for individuals, very few villages accepting it freely enough to benefit by it to any great extent. In the very few villages in which a considerable proportion of people were inoculat- ed the results of the measure were very favourable. GUJRANWALA  DISTRICT. 103. As the majority of the population of the Gujrnwla District had had no previous experience of inoculation, and were not favourably disposed towards it, operations were commenced by attempting to persuade lambardrs, patwrs and chaukdrs to be inoculated to serve as examples in the villages. At the same time meetings were held in several towns at which inoculation was advocated and a number of officials were inoculat- ed. This plan was so successful that by the end of October representatives of 482 villages in the Gujrnwla and Wazirabad Tahsls of a total of 706 as well as a number of other persons, the total amounting to 6,171, had been inoculated. After the Malkowl accident, however, inoculation operations came almost to a standstill until towards the end of January, only a few  hundred persons having been inoculated during the intervening weeks. On recommencing operations attention was at first directed to infected villages, in many of which outbreaks of plague had already attained serious proportions. It was found, however, that in this way many persons were inoculated during the incubation stage of plague, and that the development of the disease in these persons discredited inoculation. This system was therefore discontinued and inoculation was chiefly offered to villages in the early stages of outbreaks. This latter arrangement was found to be more satisfactory, and as plague spread, inoculation was more readily accepted. Between February and April 9,197 persons were inoculated, 3,709 operations having been performed in April. By the end of April the people were busy in harvesting and could not spare time to be inoculated, and only 347 inoculations were performed in May. The total number of inoculations performed in this district during the year was 16,665, of which the great majority were performed in the Gujrnwla and Wazrabad Tahsls.
?59 In only very few instances was it possible to obtain reliable statistics concerning" the results of inoculation. In few villages, however, in which special enquiries were made the incidence of plague attacks was found to be considerably less among the inoculated than among the uninoculated. Captain Harriss mentions that rumours of the evil effects of inoculation similar to those stated in last year's report to have prevailed in many districts were common in the Gujrnwla District. He adds that the accident at Malkowl, a village only a few miles from the Gujrnwla borders, did much to prejudice the people against inoculation. LAHORE DISTRICT. 104. The people of the Lahore District never accepted inoculation very freely, though more so before than after the suspension of operations. Most inoculations were performed in the Kasr Tahsl, but here, as elsewhere in the district, operations were confined to infected villages. No success was met with in the Sharakpur Tahsl, in which only one person was inoculated. Only 16,233 inoculations were performed in this district, more than half of which were performed during October 1902. The Lahore District was unfortunate in experiencing a number of changes in its medical staff. The services of Captain Ainsworth, who had been appointed District Plague Medical Officer, were required elsewhere in December, and for some time an Assistant Surgeon carried on the current duties of the office of the District Plague Medical Officer, as it was anticipated that Captain Ainsworth would soon return. He did not, however, and in February Captain Haig was appointed District Plague Medical Officer. This officer, however, was transferred to Patila in April, after which it became necessary to appoint one and then another of the European Medical Practitioners attached to the district to be District Plague Medical Officer. Both of them left in May when Assistant Surgeon Hari Ll Basu was appointed District Plague Medical Officer. These numerous changes, besides interfering seriously with the success of the inoculation operations in the district, also left nobody possessing sufficient knowledge of these operations to report upon them satisfactorily. AMRITSAR DISTRICT. 105.  Captain Browning Smith, the District Plague Medical Officer of Amritsar, has sub- mitted a very interesting and valuable report on the operation in that district, extracts from which are reproduced below :- Attitude of the people. 1.  At the commencement of operations the attitude of the people towards not only  inoculation but to any Government interference whatever, was one of vague fear and distrust, in many places of distinct hostility; although, before the spring of 1902, there had been no plague in the district, the minds of the people were saturated with rumours, vague and absurd, but, on account of their very vagueness, looming the larger in their imaginations ; rumours of being turned out of their houses and villages, with destruction and loss of property, rumours of inoculation needles a yard long which were pushed in at one side of the body and emerged at the other, rumours of a hundred and one ailments and even death following inoculation. Reports began to come in early in October that not only was the general mass of the people against inoculation, but that certain zaildrs and other local influential officials were preaching against it; steps were at once taken to meet this and the majority of zaildrs were called in to a meeting at the house of the Deputy Commissioner on October 15th, and Risaldr Partb Singh, Extra Assistant Commissioner, was telegraphed for by the Commissioner to come in from Gurdaspur and address them, which he did. All the apparatus was shown to the meeting and explained. The Deputy Commissioner, myself and the Inoculating Officers present were inoculated before the meeting and eventually the large .majority including those who were reported to have been most hostile were inoculated. First steps. 2.    On September 30th a meeting of Native Practitioners, Hakms and Baids from the city was held at the Civil Surgeon's house. Lieutenant-Colonel Mulroney, I.M.S., gave them a very excellent address, fully explaining the nature, preparation  and action  of the inoculating fluid, and some inoculations were performed before the meeting. On October 1st a meeting of Editors was called at the Deputy Commissioner's house and inoculation explained to them. On October 2nd  a similar meeting was held of all the influential men of the city, official and non- official.  Many excellent speeches were made in favour of inoculation. General plan. 3.    It was soon found that it was practically impossible to inoculate in villages not infected with plague; even if the village as a whole was not opposed to inoculation they would say that as there was no plague then they saw no use in undergoing the  slight pain and inconvenience caused by it, but that should plague appear they would reconsider the question. Attention was accordingly directed especially to those villages which were infected and where, in consequence, the villagers, much frightened at the mortality occurring, listened more attentively to the proposals for their relief.
?60 What generally happened was this, the personal assistant to the Inoculating Officer having ascertain- ed that one or two lambardrs or other officials would come forward with their families, the village was visited, and perhaps 50 or 100 inoculations performed, and this was reckoned a good result for a first visit; some days afterwards when the people were satisfied that no harm had resulted from the operation and the previously inoculated had persuaded their friends to come forward a second visit would result in perhaps another 100; when this had been done, it usually happened that one or two cases of plague occurred among the inoculated, if these recovered, the third visit usually results in a good haul, but if a death occurred the desire for inoculation was at once quenched until the people actually saw for themselves that, although one or more casualties had occurred still the large majority had escaped and they saw the thing was good, a petition would then arrive from the village and a third visit would result in 2 or 300, often more ; by this time the epidemic was probably nearly over and once it stopped the desire for inoculation stopped also, although probably not more than a quarter or perhaps third of the village had been inoculated. Towards the spring the fears of the people with regard to the operation were allayed in many parts and villages would petition for inoculation at the beginning of an outbreak, sometimes on the appearance of an unusual mortality among rats, and occasionally a healthy village would come forward. The Malkowl incident. 4.    Doubtless this unfortunate accident had in the larger towns and centres a greatly deterring influence and destroyed, at any rate for a time, any faith in inoculation that had been partially aroused, and this influence spread to villages near and in close com- munication with these towns. But this was not so in the majority of villages and I will give an instance. I had done a certain number of inoculations before the accident occurred in a village, Vairka, the first in the district to be badly attacked ; they had become convinced of the value of the operation and had asked me to go out again. The cessation of operations prevented my doing so for some time. I however borrowed from Dr. Browne, C.M.S., a few doses of the original prophylactic of March brew and when the account of the accident had appeared in the papers, I went out to the village and found a large number ready for inoculation. Before I inoculated I gave them an account of the accident, but all they said was that they had heard of it but that they had seen for themselves the good effect of inoculation and that the sooner I stopped talking and began operating the better they would be pleased. I had soon finished the few doses I had with me and the genuineness of their feelings was evidenced by the reproaches of those who had to go away unsatisfied, the reproaches of some of the women taking the form of abuse which was evidently heartfelt. No, in my opinion, the Malkowl accident, bad as it was and severe blow as it was to all those who had the success of the operations at heart, did not make the situation an irretrievable one; lost ground, caused by the unavoidable delay of waiting for new prophylactic to be made, could of course never be made up, but once the issue of this, which judging from previous experience in Jullundur and elsewhere, could be absolutely depended on, began, it was hoped that a strenuous effort would be made to redeem the scheme from failure. It soon became apparent however that Malkowl had effectually quenched the enthusiasm with which the operations were started and native officialdom soon perceived that whether they assisted or stood aloof mattered little, and instead therefore of a small army of zaildrs, lambardrs, &c., working for us and opening the gates of villages to the Inoculating Officer, we had to depend on the efforts of the personal assistant to the Inoculating Officer to worm his way into a village; with the latter, the 2,000 inoculations done in the district up to the middle of December was increased to 60,000 before operations ceased; with the former I believe our figures would have been four or five times as large. The unfortunate delay caused by the accident, and the cessation of inoculation from November 7th to December 12th, was utilized by Inoculating Officers in visiting villages, treating sick, preaching disinfection and making themselves generally known in that part of the district in which they were to recommence inoculation as soon as the fluid was received. Other influences 5.    It was seldom that one  could inoculate more than half a village even after two or three visits; although those inoculated had become firmly convinced of the value of inoculation, they could not convince the remainder, and when asked the reason they said that the others had temporarily left the village because they were afraid of the " Punjbi Doctor, " a term they seemed to apply to any native armed with a little brief authority and some disinfecting apparatus. Village factions were another difficulty in the way, one lambardr working for and the opposite faction against: a lambardr would report that a hundred or so in a village were ready and a day would be fixed; the evening before, the opposite faction would concoct and circulate an enormous lie, the more ridiculous the better, which would completely put the applicants off and destroy any chance of inoculation in the village. Other difficulties due to incomplete staff, delay in receipt of equipment and removal of staff and equipment to Delhi will be noticed under Section D (not reproduced here.) The fact of having to confine one's operations to villages where plague was  rampant resulted in a large number of cases of plague in inoculated, which doubtless had a certain deterrent effect. Education did not spread from  a favourable village to others near it to the extent that I hoped, and as a rule every village had to be separately educated. With few exceptions, the attitude of the higher and educated classes, to whom we had a right to look for example and help to their poorer brethren, was one, if not of hostility, of complete apathy. Number of inoculations. 6.    The total number performed was 62,773 ; rather more than 6 per cent. of the total population. Of these 43,619 were males, 19,154 were females. Only 4,243 were performed with the " new " fluid before November 7th. Of "these 2,335 were done in the city and only 1,908 in the district, the reason for this poor result being that operations could not be started in the district till October  23rd owing to non-arrival of necessary equipment. The highest number performed by a single officer in one day was 1,380 by Dr. Mayer, the nearest approach to this being 711 by the same officer, 605 by Dr. De'Renzi and 611 by myself.
?61 Inoculation by classes 7. The number of inoculated persons divided into classes is given below :- High caste Hinds, Jts and other Hinds came forward readily, both male and female, and one had not to observe the pardah system with them, the higher caste females being simply collected in a separate house or courtyard, the lower coming forward in the open with the men. Muhammadans were much less ready to accept inoculation, and personally I only inoculated a considerable number on two occasions, and only on one of these, a large number of females, the only occasion on which I had to observe the pardah system.  Inoculation by classes.  Europeans   20 Eurasians   1 High caste Hinds  6,317 Other Hinds  34,972 Ramdsis, Chamrs & sweepers  5,071 Musalmns   15,779 Native Christians   481 Others   132 Total  62773 Reinoculations. 8. The number of these was only 882, leaving a total number of primary inoculations of 61,891. Plague in inoculated. 9. The total number of plague cases and deaths which occurred in inoculated persons was-- Cases       762 Deaths       233 This comparatively large number is due to the fact that inoculation was principally done in villages in which plague was active; many cases occurred within a few days of inoculation and must have been incubating plague at the time of the operation. A certain number of cases were inoculated who were afterwards discovered to have been suffering from plague at the time of inoculation. These 33 cases and 27 deaths should therefore be considered as plague in uninoculated, and they are accordingly deducted, which leaves- Cases        729 Deaths       206 to be considered in the subsequent calculations. Out of the number reported, 762 cases were verified, and a full list of these with all details is given in Statement No. IV of the appendix for reference. (Not reproduced here.) The comparatively few, only 21, that were not verified have not been excluded from the returns, as I think that the non-verification was more probably due to loss of certificates and indifferent clerking than to false reports. In a few cases it was found that plague cases were brought for treatment to the Inoculating Officer on the plea that they were inoculated, and with a borrowed certificate, and were accordingly reported as cases of plague in inoculated; still, on referring to Patwrs for details of result, these cases were discovered  to be false and the returns corrected accordingly. Case mortality in inoculated. 10. The case mortality of plague in total numbers of uninoculated and inoculated is given below for comparison :-      Case mortality, per cent. cases Ratio of attacks to deaths. Uninoculated   67.89  1.5 to 1 Inoculated   28.54  3.5 to 1 The case mortality in the uninoculated is certainly too high owing to bad reporting, and this is true also of inoculated, but to a much smaller extent, as Inoculating Officers have made it a part of their work to enquire into and report cases of plague in inoculated. " New " prophylactic. 11. The few inoculations done with the new fluid and consequent small number of cases do not afford data for reliable figures. The following are the figures :- Occurred between 8th day and 120th day (1st 4 months).  { Cases 9  { Deaths 2 Case mortality    22.23 per cent. Ratio of attacks to deaths  4.5 to 1. Occurred after 120th day  { Cases 5  { Deaths 5  " Old " prophylactic. 12. The figures concerning the old prophylactic will now be considered,-first the total cases and then the cases according to their type,-bubonic, pneumonic and septic,-and work out the case mortality every day of the first week, for the first four weeks and the first four months after inoculation.
?62 The total number of cases of which full details had been received up to 20th June 1903 was 718, with 227 deaths ; of these 33 cases and 27 deaths are those in which symptoms were present before or were exhibited at or about the time of inoculation, leaving 685 cases and 200 deaths to calculate case mortality.

The first 3 days after inoculation mortality was much the same as in uninoculated, slightly less. On the 4th day a distinct improvement, the mortality falling to 40 per cent., and on the 7th day to 166 per cent.  Taking the 1st 4 weeks, there was steady improvement as time progressed, the mortality of 48.1 per cent. in the 1st week gradually dropping to 20.6 per cent. in the 4th week. Taking the first 4 months, the mortality 32.3 per cent. in the 1st month fell to 11.5 in the 4th. Roughly speaking, it seems that the protection afforded by inoculation improved up to the 4th month, the latter period being that in which it was most marked. It must not be forgotten, however, that the later periods to a certain extent correspond to the period of the epidemic when plague became milder in character. The case mortality, total, according to these figures is 29.2 percent, which is extremely favourable to inoculation when compared with that among the uninoculat- ed of 67.85 per cent. No figures are available to show how long protection lasted after the 4th month. Nine cases occurred in those inoculated with "new" fluid between the 8th and 120th day, which may be compared with those inoculated with the " old."-     Case mortality. " New "    22.23 per cent. "Old"    24.8
?63 After the 120th day there were-     Cases. Deaths. "New" ... ... ...  5  5 "Old" ... ... ...  3  ...  Mortality in different types. 13. The number of cases and deaths and the case mortality per cent. in bubonic, pneumonic and septic plague are given below :-     Cases Deaths Case mortality. Bubonic  ... ... 595 145 24.4 per cent. Pneumonic ... ...  17 14 82.4 " Septic  ... ... 73 41 56.2 "  The bubonic figures are probably fairly accurate; the others cannot be relied on. The village reporting agent and the people themselves probably recognize bubonic plague easily enough, but any one but an expert would be very prone to confuse simple pneumonia occurring in an infected village with pneumonic plague, and it is also probable that some of the cases of septic plague reported, especially the mild ones, may have been malarial or other fevers. The three cases of recoveries in inoculated from pneumonic plague that were reported are likely to be viewed with scepticism by those who are familiar with the fatality of this disease. They occurred, however, in villages suffering from that variety of the disease, and, as I shall presently show, an epidemic of pneumonic plague in a family, some of which have been inoculated, has attacked the uninoculated in preference to the inoculated, so that we may consider that inoculation confers a certain protection against this variety, and if protection, why not in some cases a modification resulting in a mild attack. 14. As no correct conclusions could possibly be drawn from the total numbers, taking the Incidence of plague in uninoculated and inoculated. district as a whole, the following procedure has been followed :- All villages in which a considerable percentage of inoculated have been exposed to plague side by side with uninoculated have been treated separately to the number of 102. The figures relating to these villages are epitomised below. Statement No. 4. In each village the average number of uninoculated and inoculated exposed daily to infection during the length of the epidemic has been worked out practically on the lines adopted by Captain E. Wilkinson, I. M. S., in his report on plague and inoculation in the Jullundur and Hoshirpur Districts; but the number of plague cases have not been deducted, as they occurred, from the population, because it would make the calculation too complicated to deal with in the time available, and the error is small, and is in favour of the uninoculated. Another point of error that could not be avoided, which operates very strongly in favour of the uninoculated, giving too low a percentage, was the flight of large numbers of uninoculated at the beginning of the epidemic, so that the total population uninoculated is too high, and the percentages too low. Cases occurring within 3 days of inoculation have been excluded in calculating percentages among inoculated, on the grounds that they were incubating plague at the time of inoculation or had not come under the influence of the operation ; on the other hand, these cases have not been used to swell the totals of cases in uninoculated. In submitting these figures therefore I think I may assert that the calculations greatly favour the uninoculated, and that the value of inoculation is computed at the lowest possible figures ; it is certainly not less than is shown, and probably is much greater.

?64 The large majority of these inoculations may really be considered to be the expressed opinion of the people themselves that inoculation is good. No pressure was exercised, and, once the difficulty of doing 50 or 80 inoculations in a village had been surmounted, the remainder of the inoculations done there was the result of the establishment of conviction in the minds of the villagers that the measure, in spite of its drawbacks, temporary indisposition and especially its failure in many instances, is on the whole distinctly beneficial. It will be seen that the figures are based on 42,380 inoculations, more than two-thirds of the total performed in the district. Calculating from the data given and condensing them into popular expression, we may say that in these 102 villages 1,706 lives were saved by inoculation. Below are given particulars of some individual villages for convenience :-  Villages. Average number exposed to infection. Plague deaths per 100 of population.

The death per 100 of population uninoculated and inoculated is given for comparison, the death-rate being a more accurate index than the case rate.                                  Look at Mohanpur, which suffered a very severe outbreak, in which 16.26 per cent. of uninoculated died, and only 1.34 per cent, of inoculated. At Sangatpura, where there were 297 uninoculated and '344 inoculated, there were 22 cases and 20 deaths in the former, not a single case among the latter. At Kot Mahmed Khn, a small village, out of 263 uninoculated, 2471 per cent. died of plague, a quarter of their number, while 71 inoculated escaped without an attack. At Lohar, 13 per cent. of 568 uninoculated died, while there was not a single case among 254 inoculated. Before leaving the subject of protective value of inoculation, I must mention the case of Wirna, a village in the Tarn Tran Tahsl, the only village in the district which is supposed to have been totally inoculated ; this village although in the centre of a cluster of villages that were badly attacked, has completely escaped infection. Infection in separate families. 15.    In the statement below a number of instances are given showing the protective value of inoculation, both in bubonic and pneumonic plague. The Murdpore case was a very important one.   It occurred at the beginning of the operations ; the Lambardr of the village was inoculated at the first assemblage at Tarn Tran because he thought as an
?65 Official he had better be done ; the village was dead against it ; when, however, the whole of the Lambarda's family died while he alone escaped, the opinion quickly changed and greatly assisted in bringing home to this portion of the district the value of inoculation : -       Number.

66 Future prospects. 16.   In a large number of villages in the dis   anthere is now a strong feeling in favour of inoculation and I hear of many villages which express a wish for reinoculation in the end of the autumn, as they say that now they see the value of the measure, they are not going to wait a second time until the disease is well established, but will all be inoculated before it begins. GURDASPUR DISTRICT. 105. Captain More, I.M.S., who was the District Plague Medical Officer of the Gurds- pur-District, reports that the prospects of a successful campaign in the district seemed at first promising, as over 300 applications for inoculations were received from villagers early in October 1902. Most of these applications came from villages in the Shakargarh Tahsl, and operations were accordingly commenced there. It soon became evident, however, that the petitions for inoculations were not of worth value, and considerable pressure was required in order to induce the people to accept inoculation. Up to November 7th, on which date orders were received directing the suspension of operations, 11,437 persons had been inoculated. This represented the work of rather less than a month, as operations had not been commenced until October 10th. Captain More is of opinion that the Malkowal accident except in the larger towns, where it seriously affected the process of inoculation, made but little impression upon the people, who regarded the account of it, if it reached them at all, in much the same way as many rumours of the evil effects of inoculation. It may be pointed out, however, that inoculation had been almost confined to rural area before the operations were suspended, and that the number of inoculations performed during the whole of the remainder of the season did not amount to the month's work mentioned above. Captain More remarks that the " new " prophylactic gave little  or  no reaction, and was for this reason preferred by the people to the " old " fluid. One reason given for the failure of the people to accept inoculation was that, as the season was warm, it became apparent that plague was not going to be severe, and that therefore the people did not think it worth while to be inoculated. GUJRAT DISTRICT. 106. It was in the Gujrat District that the Malkowl accident occurred. This has been described elsewhere, though it may be mentioned here that plague broke out at Malkowl in November, when 23 inoculated persons were attacked of whom 19 died. The measure in which the people of the Gujrt District came forward for inoculation before this accident occurred gave considerable promise of a successful campaign ; afterwards not a single inoculation was performed in the district. Fortunately, however, the outbreak of plague in this district was a mild one. SHAHPUR DISTRICT.   107. The people of the Shahpur District were opposed to the inoculation operation. Their objection was that impotency and blindness was the result of the operation, and consequently only 741 operations were performed in the district during the year under report. JHELUM DISTRICT. 108. In October 1902  an attempt was made to introduce inoculation in Jhelum, but this was strongly opposed. Only 26 persons all told were inoculated and they were mostly officials and school boys. JHANG DISTRICT. 109. The people of the Jhang District were averse to the inoculation operation, saying     they feared impotency, and consequently only 1,810 operations were performed in the district during the year under report.

?XXX APPENDIX III. The extracts given below are from Chapters IV to VII of the Punjab Plague Manual 1902 :- CHAPTER IV. ARRANGEMENTS FOR PERFORMING INOCULATION. Inoculations usually to be performed free at public stations, but arrangements to be made for free " par- dah" inoculation of " pardah " women unable to pay fees and for private inoculation on payment of other persons. 31. The arrangements and method in accord- ance with which inoculations are actually to be perform- ed are as follows : - See paragraph 43 (6) below. In every village in which inoculations are performed a public inoculation station shall be fixed upon for each officer inoculating in the village in consultation with the leading men of the village for the conveni- ence of all concerned. Twelve hours' notice through the Zaildr and Lambardrs should be given in the village and the neighbourhood of the time when inoculations will be performed at the public station, and the Inoculating Officer shall at the time and place fixed inoculate free of charge all who offer themselves for the operation. The Inoculating Officer shall also arrange for the free inoculation at private houses, under "pardah" conditions, of "pardah" women whose means do not admit of paying the fee prescribed for private inoculations. In the case of other persons who desire the performance of inoculations in any place other than a public inoculation station the Inoculating Officer may, in so far as he can do so without preju- dicing his free inoculation work, perform inoculations on payment in private houses or other places where it is desired that the operation should be performed. It should be made known that private inoculations on payment will be done and that those who desire it must submit a written application for it to the Inoculating Officers together with the  necessary fee. A fee of Rs. 10 must in every case be paid with the application, but in case the number of persons privately inoculated in any one place on an application amounts to 50 or more, Rs. 5 out of the fee shall be returned to the applicant. On receiving more than one application for private inoculations the Inoculating Officer shall go by preference to that place where the largest number of people will offer themselves for the operation. The forms pres- cribed below shall be used for receipts on account of fees and for the record of other necessary details concerning private inoculations. Arrangements for inoculation. 32. Whether inoculations are done in public or in private, an inoculation certificate shall be prepared for each inoculated person and the details prescribed shall be entered up in the inoculation registers. The following arrangements will be found useful in dealing with large assemblies of people in order to prevent the gathering of crowds around the inoculator and his assistants and for the orderly and rapid passage of persons past the inoculator :- Preliminary arrangements. (1) Each Inoculating Officer will be provided with a compounder and one or more clerks, and it will be his duty to see that these men are properly instructed in their duties and perform them satisfactorily. His es- tablishment should precede the Inoculating Officer to the place where inoculations are to be performed and while the clerks should proceed with the writing up of the certificates of candidates for inoculation the compounder should arrange the prophylactic and inoculating apparatus and should fill the syringes to be used with carbolic lotion, 1 in 20. The Inocu- lating Officer's establishment with the help of the leading men of the place, should also arrange to obtain the services of persons to assist in matters to be presently described and should as far as possible get everything ready so that the inoculator may be able to begin work immediately on his arrival. The inoculator on his arrival should choose his seat, prefer- ably under a large tree, and a number of charpoys (native bedsteads) should be arranged so as to form a ' queue ' wide at the distant end and narrowing gradually, until just before reaching the inoculator's seat there is room for only one person to pass at a time. A fence of charpoys should also be placed around the inoculator and the compounder with his assistant. Certificates : method of making copies. (2) No person should be admitted into the 'queue' till he or she has obtained a certificate filled in with the necessary details. Each certificate must be on a printed bilingual form which will be supplied by Government.  A piece of thin paper is affixed to the back of each certificate, and in order that this thin paper may contain a reproduction of every entry made on the certificate each person who makes any entry on the certificate must do so in lead pencil after laying the certificate on to a copying tablet so that the thin paper lies between the certificate and the tablet. The tablets are of wood, and as many as are required will be supplied, together with bottles of copying com- position: before use each day a thin layer of the composition should be smeared on the prepared side of the tablet and the composition should be renewed as often as the copies obtained from it become faint. The use of the tablets will ensure that each piece of thin paper contains copies of all the entries made on the certificate to which it is attached, and as the paper is transparent the copies can be read through it. When all the entries on the certificate are completed, the thin paper is detached and retained in order that the entries on it may be copied into the Inoculation Register, and the original certificate is handed over to the inoculated person to takeaway with him. Entries on certificates. (3) The details which should be filled in on his certificate before any candidate for inoculation is  admitted  to the 'queue' are all entries down  to and  including 'place' excepting the serial number, and the clerk responsible for preparing certificates will also see that the impression
?xxxi of the left thumb of each candidate has been taken, upon his certificate in the space pro- vided for the purpose. The clerk will also draw a diagonal line across every certificate given to a female: this will facilitate counting separately the numbers of males and females inoculated. The entries in the certificates may be either in English or in Urdu with the exception of the serial number, dose, number of brew, and date, which must be in English. When the number of candidates is very large the clerk should obtain the assistance of villagers or others to help them in taking thumb impressions and in writing out certificates. Any intelligent person can take thumb impressions after a little instruction, and in most large villages several will be found who can write Urdu. Entries which remain to be made on the certificates when the candidates are admitted to the ' queue' will be made by, or under the immediate supervision of, the Inoculating Medical Officer. Marshalling of candidates  for inoculation in " queues." (4) All persons who have obtained certificates should be marshalled  info the ' queue ' by the Lambardrs, and other men of in- fluence, told off for the purpose. It is very desirable that these Lambar- drs and men of influence should themselves be inoculated first in the presence of all assembled in order to set an example. In this connexion it is to be noted that the arrangement of the people into groups according to their villages and sex is of importance in facilitating the compilation of and references to the Inoculation Registers. Moreover, other things being equal, the people of the most dis- tant villages should be inoculated first in order to keep them away from their homes for as short a time as possible, and for this reason, as well as in order to be free from the distres- sing cries of the children as soon as possible, it will be found advantageous to inoculate women and children first. When, therefore, as may often happen, people from several villages collect at one place for inoculation, it will be found convenient to arrange them in groups according to the village from which they come and to have them admitted to the ' queue ' in this order, the women and children first. All the persons in the ' queue' should be required to sit down and to bare their left arms, removing any ornaments or other things they may be wearing above the elbow. Assistants required. (5) Before commencing operations the inoculator should select certan intelligent persons to help him. One man will be required to take the certificates from candidates for inoculation, a second to write the dose and number of brew of the prophylactic, a third to disinfect the arms of persons before and after inoculation, a fourth to assist the compounder by opening and holding bottles of prophylactic, a fifth to enter the serial numbers on the inoculation certificates, and a sixth to tear off and file the tissue papers from the certificates and hand over the certificates to the inoculated persons. General     description    of   arrangements     for  the orderly performance of inoculation en masse. (6) The inoculator will find it convenient to seat himself on a low stool facing the narrow end of the ' queue' with a small table at his right hand. On the other side of the table, and slightly to the inccula- tor's front, the compounder and his assistant should be stationed. The arrangements which will be found generally most convenient, and which should be adopted as far as possible, will be clear from a reference to the illustration prefixed to this volume* and from the following description of it. The illustration is a rough sketch taken from a photograph of a typical inoculation scene. In the upper right hand corner the people are represented obtaining their certificates from the clerk (1). After they have done this they have their thumb impressions affixed to the certificates (2). They then proceed with the certificates to the ' queue ' of bedsteads and sit down, moving gradually forwards. As each person approaches the operator, he gives up his certificate to an assistant (3), who, besides taking the certificates, keeps order generally and tells the candidates to bare their left arms and remove any ornaments or any other things they may be wearing above the elbow. This assistant hands the certifi- cates to another assistant (4), who enters on them the dose of prophylactic and the number of the brew, of which the operator and compounder respectively keep him informed. Another assistant (5) sitting at the operator's feet disinfects the candidate's arm with carbolic lotion, and instructs him, in case the operator is unable to do so, to place his left elbow on the operator's right knee, upon which the operator duly inoculates him, and, though this is not shown in the picture, stamps his inoculation certificate with the India rubber stamp provided for the purpose. The inoculated person then rises and moves on and waits for his certificate, which, as soon as the serial number has been entered on it by assistant (6), is handed to him by assistant (7) after he has removed the duplicate attached to its back. The number entered on each certificate should consist of its serial number as a numerator and the Inoculating Officer's number as a denominator. The duplicates assistant (7) ties into bundles or places on files, taking care to file them, face downwards, according to their serial numbers. A clerk (8), who should be seated near (7), enters in the Inoculation Register the particulars recorded on the certificates. All entries in the Inoculation Register must be made in English, and to facilitate the preparation of the prescribed daily inoculation returns a number of wire files will be provided, and when the inoculation registers are being entered up the clerk will file the duplicate certificates according to the places, to which the inoculated persons belong, the certificates of males and females being placed on separate files. In the illustration the compounder (9) and his assistant (10) are represented as standing; they should, however, be permitted to sit down to diminish fatigue. Here also the bottles of prophylactic are shown as laid out upon a bed and the empty bottles are shown as thrown on the ground. These details will be differently arranged for in future, as boxes are being provided with a number of compartments, in which the bottles are arranged according to the serial number of the brew of prophylactic they contain. Each bottle can thus be taken from its compartment as required, and should be returned to it immedi- ately it is. emptied. * Not reproduced.
?xxxii Arrangement and preliminary sterilisation of appara- tus required by the Inoculating Officer. (7) Before beginning to inoculate the inoculator should arrange his apparatus on the table, if this has not already been done by the compounder. He should see that everything is in good order. The various articles required are- (1) Inoculating syringes; (2) Spirit lamp and apparatus for heating oil, including matches; (3) Small trays containing carbolic lotion ( 1 in 20),in which are a pair of dissecting forceps, spare needles, and some small pieces of lint; (4) A bowl of carbolic lotion (1 in 20) containing a small swab of lint held in a pair of catch-forceps; (5) A basin of water, for washing hands, with soap and towel; (6) A towel for the operator's knee. Having arranged his apparatus the inoculator sterilizes all the needles he intends to use by dropping them into oil heated to 160 C. The fact that this temperature has been reached can be readily ascertained by dropping on to the oil a bread-crumb or a drop of water : at the required temperature the bread-crumb will immediately turn brown and the drop of water will immediately boil off. After immersing his needles in the heated oil the operator should place them in carbolic lotion until required for use. In fitting the needles to the syringes care should be taken that they fit the nozzles accurately ; otherwise they are liable to fall off, or air may be drawn into the syringe, thus preventing its being properly filled with prophylactic. The syringes, which the compounder should have filled with carbolic lotion 1 in 20, should now be emptied and rinsed out with a little prophylactic, after which they should be handed to the compounder to be filled for use. If the syringes have not been in use for some time they should be filled with and immersed in carbolic lotion 1 in 20, for 24 hours immediately before use. Method of opening bottles. (8) The opening of bottles of prophylactic and the filling of syringes are the chief duties of the compounder, and in performing these duties he should be strictly guided by the following instruc- tions :- (1) The bottles are to be arranged according to the serial number of the brews they contain. They are so arranged in the boxes in which they are supplied, and if removed from the boxes they should be covered with a thick cloth until required for use to protect them from warmth and light. (2) One brew is to be finished before another is to be taken into use. The compounder will inform the Inoculating Officer of the serial number and dose of each brew as it is taken into use. (3) Before opening each bottle the compounder must see that it is not leaking or injured. The contents of any bottle that is leaking or injured are to be rejected, as also are those which have any peculiar appearance or smell. All bottles which should be rejected are to be brought to the immediate notice of the Inoculating Medical Officer. (4) The compounder, in proceeding to open a bottle, must shake it well, then dip its neck into carbolic lotion, 1 in 20, and then with a pair of dissecting forceps, which when not in use are to be kept in the carbolic lotion, remove the cork, holding the bottle as horizontally as possible without spilling its contents. The cork is to be kept in the carbolic lotion while the syringe is being filled and is to be replaced immediately after. If there is great press of work the duty of actually opening the bottles may be entrusted to any intelligent person, care being taken to see that he observes the above instructions carefully. (5) The contents of a bottle that has been once opened are to be thrown away if not used immediately. (6) All empty bottles with their corks are to be replaced in the boxes immediately after use. Method of filling syringes. (9) From the bottles that have been opened and are in use the syringes should be filled accord- ing to the following instructions:- (1) Dip the needle in carbolic lotion, 1 in 20. (2) Insert the needle into the neck of the bottle, carefully avoiding injury to the point of the needle and holding both syringe and needle as horizontally as possible without spilling the contents of the bottle. The bottle should be held, with the side which is prolonged into the neck lowermost, and the needle should be inserted with its apperture downwards so as to obtain the last drop of prophylactic. (3) Withdraw the piston-rod of the syringe slowly, taking care to keep the point of the needle covered, so as to avoid getting air into the syringe. Should any air enter, it should be got rid of by holding the syringe vertically upwards and pressing the piston-rod. When the air is ejected the syringe should be filled with prophylactic. The entrance of air is frequently due to imperfect attachment of the needle to the nozzle of the syringe and can be avoided by correcting this defect. (4) Any accident, such as the disarrangement of the syringe or needle or injury to any part of the apparatus, is immediately to be brought to the notice of the Inoculat- ing Medical Officer.
?xxxiii The operation of inoculation. (IO) Different operators may have different methods of performing the operation of inoculation, but it will be found convenient by all to arrange that the person to be  inocu- lated should be instructed to sit on the ground and, for the operation, place his left elbow on the operator's right knee, which should be covered with a towel. Candidates for inoculation to be seated. There are several advantages in making the people sit, both while waiting for their turn and during the operation. In the first place it is less tiring to the opera- tor and to candidates for inoculation to sit than to stand, while the latter when sitting are much easier to manage both as a crowd and as individuals than when standing. There can be but little jostling by people waiting for their turns when all are seated, and a person seated on the ground with his arm in the grasp of the operator is less able than one standing up to jerk himself from the prick of the needle. Seat of inoculation; advantages of the left arm. The choice of the arm as the seat of inoculation has the following recommendations. It necessitates little exposure, an import- ant consideration when dealing with women. The skin on the outer side of the arm, midway between the shoulder and the elbow, is thinner and seemingly less sensitive than that of many other parts of the body, and certainly than that of the flank. Further, after inoculation there often is considerable pain about the puncture, especially on movement, and it is much easier to keep the arm at rest than the flank, for while almost every movement of the body affects the flank, almost all movement of the arm can be avoided by the use of a sling. Persons inoculated in the arm are thus able to be about as soon as the fever has passed off. The left arm is chosen as it is less used than the right. Rules which  must be observed in  the  actual  per- In performing the operation of inoculation there are certain essential details which must be scrupulously observed. These are formance of the operation.                                          the following:- (1) The site of inoculation must be wiped with carbolic lotion before and after the insertion of the needle. Should any blood ooze from the puncture on the with- drawal of the needle, a piece of lint soaked in carbolic lotion, 1 in 20, should be applied. This should be applied by the assistant who is entrusted with the duty of disinfecting arms, who, for the performance of his duties, should be separately provided with a bottle of carbolic lotion, 1 in 20, a small bowl, a pair of catch- forceps, and a number of small pieces of lint. The lotion should be poured into the bowl as required, and the pieces of lint, which are held in the forceps and used for wiping the seat of inoculation, should be changed, like the lotion, when they become dirty, the catch-forceps permitting this to be done quickly. (2) Before each inoculation the needle must be wiped with a piece of lint soaked  in carbolic lotion, 1 in 20, and dipped into this lotion. (3) Care must be taken to see that the needle is inserted with its point downwards in order to prevent the injection of any air that may have got into the syringe. (4) The Inoculator before inserting the needle should always note that there is no air, other than a few small bubbles, in the syringe. If there is more than this it will become compressed while pressure is made on the piston and, owing to the expan- sion of the air in the syringe, a portion of the dose which should have been injected will escape from the needle when it is withdrawn. The inoculated person will therefore not have received his proper dose. (5) A fold of skin should be pinched up at the seat of the inoculation (which, as indicat- ed above, should usually be on the outer side of the left arm about midway bet- ween the shoulder and the elbow) and the needle inserted to about half its length under the skin and parallel to the fold of skin. Care should be taken to see that the needle does not go deeper than the subcutaneous tissue. (6) The dose of prophylactic should be injected slowly. (7) The dose of prophylactic mentioned on the bottle may safely be given to all persons in good health between the ages of 15 and 60. Robust men may be given one or two-fifths more without ill-effect. The following minimum proportion of the dose marked on the bottle should be given for the different age-periods named, viz :- From 1 year to 2 years, one-fifth. From 2 to 5 years, two-fifths. From 6 to 11 years, three-fifths. From 12 to 15 years, four-fifths. From 15 to 60 years, five-fifths. From 60 to 70 years, three-fifths. There are five screw-marks between each two lines marking c. c. on the stem 01 the 20 c. c. inoculation syringes. A full turn of the stop from one screw-mark to the next will therefore indicate one-fifth of a. c. c. (8) The operator will see that the assistant appointed for this purpose enters correctly on the certificate of each inoculated person the dose of the prophylactic given and the serial number of the brew. He will himself inform the assistant as to the dose given and will see that the compounder keeps him informed as to the number of the brew. Immediately after inoculating each person the operator will himself stamp the inoculated persons certificate with the India rubber stamp provided. He will take care to see that this stamp never leaves his possession, as its impres- sion on the certificate constitutes the only proof that the person has been inoculat ed by him.
?XXXIV (9) At the conclusion of each day's operations the operator should himself rinse out with carbolic lotion (1 in 20) all syringes that have been in use and should sterilise all his needles and instruments in oil heated to 160 C, thus also protecting them from rust. Records to be written  up  on  completion  of   each day's operations. (II) As soon as all persons who offer themselves and are fit have been inoculated  and  have  been provided with completed certificates, all the clerks must complete the work of copying into the Inoculation Regis- ter the enteries concerning all persons who have been inoculated, and they should also prepare the daily registers and  returns prescribed below for Inoculating Officers. Persons who should not be inoculated. (12) No person in a bad state of health should be inoculated. The only exception to this rule should be that during epidemics of plague when  there is  considerable danger of a person contracting the disease, he may on his express request be inoculated,  if the operator considers that his life is not endangered thereby. Great care should be taken to refrain from inoculating any person who has contracted plague before presenting himself for inoculation. A few persons have been inoculated during the very early stage of plague without the course of the disease being prejudicially affected thereby, but the Indian Plague Commission (Report, paragraph 462) recorded its opinion that " t seems to us unlikely that the anti-plague inoculation can exert any favourable influence on persons who are already incubating plague." If plague, contracted before inoculation, developes in the usual course and death supervenes, the result is likely to be attributed to the inoculation and the people are likely to become suspicious of the operation. Infants under six months and very old people are but slightly liable to attacks of plague, and may therefore be preferably left uninoculated. In the absence of immediate danger of infection it is preferable not to inoculate women far advanced in pregnancy lest any ill-effect occurring after the operation should be attributed to it and thus raise a pre- judice against the inoculation. During an epidemic it is advisable to inoculate pregnant women up to with- in a few weeks of their delivery, for attacks of plague in such cases are almost uniformly fatal both to the woman and child. Inoculation in exceptional circumstances. 33.    While it is obviously convenient to adopt and adhere to one method of operating, the wishes of persons who desire to be inoculated in any particular situation should be complied with as much as possible. It is not uncommon, for instance, for a person to ask to be inoculated over some painful spot or rheumatic joint with the hope of obtaining relief from the pain of sciatica or rheumatism. Moreover, special arrange- ments are required for the inoculation of "pardah" women, who, as noted above, are to be inoculated free of charge under "pardah" conditions. The best way of dealing with such women is to have as many as possible collected in one locality and to fix upon a place where the women can pass under" pardah " to and from a room or yard which has a doorway or convenient window communicating with the outside. This doorway or window should be screened by a curtain having a hole in it, and the inoculator should station himself outside it so that he can operate on each woman as she comes up to the curtain from the inside and presents her arm at the hole. The certificates of women should be written up and their thumb impressions taken with the help of those who assist in collecting them together for inoculation. Where there are lady doctors who are willing to perform inoculations for "pardah" women or others, either in the places where they reside or elsewhere, there is no objection to their doing so, provided they make their own arrangements for fees and other expenses, such as travelling allowance: such fees and expenses should be arranged for and paid by those who desire the services of the lady doctors and will not be paid out of Provincial or Local Funds. Prophylactic and apparatus will be supplied to the lady doctors on the condition that the prescribed certificates are given to inoculated persons and that the prescribed registers and returns are maintained and submitted. CHAPTER V. THE "PRECHING" OF INOCULATIONS. Points of practical importance for every one to consider in connexion with inoculation in plague- infected or threatened places. 34. It is very important that not only individuals but whole communities should be inoculated and that as much in advance of an outbreak of plague in their midst as is possible. Uninoculated persons in a community are a greater source of infection and a greater danger than inoculated persons, and the same is the case with uninoculated communities as compared with those which are inoculated. If the inhabitants of a village or town in an infected or threatened area refuse to be inoculated, they are liable to create a centre of infection for their neighbourhood. The points of practical importance therefore which every individual in every community should carefully consider are- (1) that inoculation affords a very considerable protection against an attack of plague, such attacks as do occur being far less fatal than those occurring among uninoculated persons; (2) that the protection afforded lasts as long as epidemics of plague usually do in the Punjab, and that therefore persons inoculated immediately before or during a plague season may reasonably hope to escape illness or death during that plague season ; and (3) that this protection is conferred by a medicine which causes but slight inconvenience and is quite harmless and which contains nothing that can affect the religious susceptibilities or social customs of any person. Plague is a very serious disease because of its long persistence in infected localities, its tendency to recrudesce, the high case mortality among persons attacked, the absence of any really effective medical treatment appli- cable after attack, and the difficulty of inducing the people to adopt adequate precautionary and preventive measures such as avoidance of contact with infection, evacuation, and disinfection. Inoculation offers to any individual, who may be sensible enough to desire to take precautions for his personal safety, a protection against plague which he can secure for himself independently of the co-operation of his neighbours, and he
? XXXV can secure this once for all by undergoing a simple operation of which the discomfort is inconsiderable in com- parison with the discomfort entailed by other measures, such as evacuation. In plague therefore more than in other diseases the use of a prophylactic of proved value is important. In the same way as the people have- taken to vaccination against small-pox and small-pox has decreased in proportion to the degree in which the population is vaccinated, it is to be hoped that the people will take to inoculation and by its help will check the ravages of plague. The advantages of inoculation should therefore be carefully explained to the people and the utmo-t efforts should be made to induce them to accept it generally, though at the same time it should be pointed out that as inoculation is not a complete safeguard other precautionary and preventive measures should never be neglected when plague imminently threatens or actually breaks out amongst an inoculated community. On the outbreak of plague such a community, like an uninoculated one, should evacuate its village and use every endeavour to destroy by disinfection the infection which has been introduced amongst it. The "preaching" of inoculation. 35.    Many persons are already convinced of the value of inoculation, and officers on plague duty will have no difficulty with them: they will not improbably ask for inoculation of their own accord. The difficulty is with stupid and careless persons and those who are blinded by prejudice or are afraid of a little physical discomfort and suspicious of the after effects of inoculation. Such persons may be willing to prefer the risk of dying of a terrible disease and introducing it among their relatives and friends to undergoing a little pain and discomfort in order to obtain comparative immunity. But their opposition can be overcome by the exer- cise of tact and patience and by enlisting the sympathies of sensible and influential persons in order to argue with and to reassure the doubters and to impress upon them that it is their duty to become inoculated both in their own interests and in the interests of their neighbours. To ensure success in the inoculation operations it is essential that the advantages of inoculation should be " preached " in every district not only by the Civil Officers who will be specially appointed for the purpose, but also by the Deputy Commissioner and his ordi- nary district staff. Systematic preaching and arrangements for having the people ready at each inoculating station previous to the commencement of his work there by the Inoculating Officer are very necessary if each officer specially appointed for inoculation duty in the coming cold weather is to work up to the average of 700 inoculations per day, which the Lieutenant-Governor trusts may be attained. The ordinary district staff should therefore be guided by the same instructions as apply to the Civil Officers specially deputed for plague duty, which are set forth in the next paragraph. CHAPTER VI. DUTIES OF OFFICERS IN CONNEXION WITH PLAGUE. Duties of Civil Officers specially employed in con- nexion with inoculation. 36     Civil Officers should make it their business to become acquainted as thoroughly as possible with the people of the circle to which they are posted and to gain their confidence. They should maintain maps of their circles, marking out the boundaries of zails and  noting- the names of the Zaildrs and leading men in each zail, and they should also have lists of the villages in their circles with a note of their populations. They should try and enlist the sympathies and co-operation of all influential men, heads of communities and sects, Zaildrs, members of District Boards and Municipal Committees and others whose advice or example is likely to  have weight with the people. The co-operation of such men and the example which they can set by submitting to inoculation themselves with their families (especially their women) and dependents is  particularly important. The Civil Officers should visit all  the villages in their circles as frequently as possible and  endeavour to  get the  people together to listen to arguments in favour of inoculation.  At such meetings the objections and arguments of the people should be considerately dealt with, and  it should be impressed upon every one that while no other practicable measure affords a greater hope of relief from the ravages of plague, and that although Government is anxious that inoculation should  be freely accepted, yet no compulsion will be used and the acceptance or rejection of inoculation  depends on the choice of every individual concerned.  They should use every means in their power to assist Inoculating Officers and in particular should arrange for the collection of persons in large numbers in villages to be visited by the Inoculating Officers, and under the orders of the  Deputy  Commissioner should, in communication with the Inoculating Officers, arrange dates for their visits to the various villages in which the people are willing to come  forward. They should make such arrangements as are necessary for encamping-grounds for Inoculating Officers and for  the carriage of their personal effects, apparatus, and material, and for supplies for them and their  establishments. The cost of carriage will in the case of Medical Officers who have been specially engaged in England be paid by the Civil Officers under the orders of the Deputy Commissioner, and as these Medical Officers will be new to the country and will be unable to speak or understand the vernacular, Civil Officers  should   keep   in  very close touch with them and advise them concerning their relations with the people, bringing to their  notice customs and prejudices which require to be respected so as to avoid giving offence. They should also do every- thing in their power to secure for such officers the confidence and respect of the  people.  Officers on special duty should also maintain registers, and submit weekly reports, in accordance with the instructions detailed below in this volume. ******* Control of plague operations vested in the District Magistrate, subject to the orders of the Commissioner of the Division and of the Local Government.      Punjab Government Notification No. 717 L.-P.,  dated the 27th May 1901-page 45, Plague  Hand- *   Book.  Punjab Government Notification No. 1068, dated  the 5th September 1901-page 53, Plague Hand- Book. 37. In accordance with the first clause of each of the notifications quoted in the margin* " the general control of plague operations will vest in the District Magistrate, the Commissioner of the Division, and the Local Government. ******* Special duties of District Plague Medical Officers. Page 54, Plague Hand-Book. In each district there will be a District Plague Medical Officer, who under clause 6 of Punjab Govern- ment Notification No. 1086 L.-P.,    "will be in charge of the medical arrangements and also of disinfecting operations, which will be carried out under his orders. Any general direction issued by the Plague Medical Officer should be sent for the information of the District Magistrate and Chief Plague Medical Officer.    In
xxxvi case of any disagreement between a Plague Medical Officer and an Executive Plague Officer the Plague Medical Officer may apply direct to the District Magistrate for orders." The District Plague Medical Officer must keep in constant touch with the District Magistrate and with all Inoculating Officers in his district, with whose immediate control and supervision he will be entrusted. Unless he has received general orders from the District Magistrate on the subject or has no doubt as to the concurrence of the District Magis- trate in any step which he proposes to take, he shall invariably consult him before taking any important action such as the transfer of an Inoculating Officer from one village to another, the commencement of inoculation operations in any part of the district or in individual villages, and the like. The District Plague Medical Officer will himself perform inoculations and will go on tour principally for that purpose, but he will in addition be responsible for the maintenance of the District registers prescribed below and the preparation and punctual despatch of returns, and he shall also be responsible for such action as may be necessary to ensure the punctual submission to him of their returns by Inoculating Officers, and shall, as frequently as possible, visit these officers and inspect their registers and consult with them about their work. In addition to his inoculation clerks, every District Plague Medical Officer will be provided with one Office Clerk, who will, under his orders, maintain all the registers, prepare all returns, as well as all salary travelling allowance, contingent, and other, bills, conduct correspondence, and carry out instructions generally. A permanent advance of Rs. 200 will be made to each District Plague Medical Officer to enable him to meet urgent and contingent expenditure. A contingent register shall be maintained in accordance with the instructions in paragraph 79 of the Civil Account Code, Volume I, the entries on account of the inoculation operations being recorded separately, and all expenditure from the advance shall be accounted for in contin- gent bills. Expenditure incurred solely in connexion with inoculation, whether salary, travelling allowance, contingent, or miscellaneous, shall be accounted for in separate bills, which shall be conspicuously marked with the words " Inoculation Operations." The District Plague Medical Officer will arrange for the supply and distribution of all articles .required in connexion with the operations under his direction in his district. A regular daily supply of prophylactic will be sent from the Plague Research Laboratory to each district in which inoculation operations are being carried on. The Plague Medical Officer will arrange for the distribution of this to all Inoculating Officers, and for the immediate collection and return of all empty bottles. In every district in which inoculation operations are being carried on a reserve supply of prophylactic certificates, registers, &c., will be maintained by the Civil Surgeon, on whom the Plague Medical Officer will indent in case of emergency. A further reserve will be kept at the Central Disinfection Dept, which should be indented upon only if the Civil Surgeon is unable to meet the demands made upon him. A reserve of syringes, needles, and other necessaries, will be kept at the Central Disinfection  Dept to meet emergent requirements. A stock of Inoculation Registers and certificates and of all other registers and returns required by Plague Medical Officers will be maintained by the Superintendent, Central Disinfection Dept, to whom indents for the same should be addressed. All empty bottles should be returned to the source of supply, i.e.. those received direct from the Plague Research Laboratory should be returned there direct, and those received from the Civil Surgeons or the Superintendent, Central Disinfection Dept, should be returned to those officers. Care should be taken to maintain an ample supply of everything required for inoculation. By timely indents, on the Civil Surgeon or on the Superintendent, Central Disinfection Dept, it should be possible to avoid ever running out of anything. The arrangements for the distribution of prophylactic and other supplies to officers working in the rural tracts will vary in different districts. The Plague Medical Officer will therefore ask the advice and assistance of the Civil authorities in this matter. Special duties of Inoculating Officers. 39.    All Inoculating Officers will be under the general direction and supervision of the District Plague Medical Officer, from whom they will obtain their staff and equipment and to whom they will submit with punctuality and accuracy the returns prescribed below, They will also be responsible for maintaining correctly and up to date the registers prescribed for Inoculating Officers. In all their dealings with the people of the country Inoculating Officers will be guided by the advice of the local Civil Officers or of the Civil Officers on special duty with them, and they shall keep the District Plague Medical Officer fully informed of their movements and of the temper of the people among whom they work. They shall not proceed to any place for inoculation work without the previous sanction of the District Plague Medical Officer and shall conform to any general or special orders which he may communicate to them as to the villages or tracts in which they shall work. They shall strictly comply with any orders on the subject which they may receive from the District Magistrate direct. They must be particularly careful to see that no compulsion whatever is used to force inoculation on the people and shall inoculate only those who offer themselves voluntarily for the operation. They shall charge no fees for inoculation except such as are authorised by the instructions in paragraph 31 above, and they shall keep a correct account of such fees as are paid to them, and shall every Monday, or whenever the sum in hand amounts to Rs. 50, remit to the District Plague Medical Officer by money order or messenger, in such a manner as to ensure its safety, the amount which has been paid to them in fees. General duties of all Medical Officers. 40.    In addition to performing the operation of inoculation, maintaining the prescribed registers, submitting the prescribed returns, and doing the other duties which may be assigned to him in accordance with the above instructions, it is the duty of every Medical Officer to do all in his power to induce the people to accept inoculation voluntarily. He should when asked to do so, or whenever an opportunity for doing so occurs, explain the nature of the prophylactic,
?xxxvii the effects of inoculation, and the advantages to be expected from it. Every Medical Officer may also, when requested to do so, examine and treat sick persons, provided that this does not interfere with his inoculation work. He shall also when ordered to do so enquire into and report on the occurrence of plague in any particular village or individual, and indicate what individuals should be treated as contacts. The principal one of these subsidiary duties will be that of enquiring, on a requisition by the District Plague Medical Officer in accordance with instructions in paragraph 46 below, whether any particular village or individual has plague, and in connexion with such enquiries Medical Officers should be very careful to note that a medical examination of any person or the inspection of any corpse is not to be made if it is objected to. Natives as a rule do not desire European medical treatment for plague, and this must not be forced upon them, and the compulsory segregation of contacts can be enforced only in very exceptional cases under the written orders of the District Magistrate. All Medical Officers should exert their influence in order to get the people to adopt proper measures, such as evacuation and disinfection, wherever necessary. REGISTERS RETURNS, AND REPORT. Report by District Magistrate of outbreak of plague in any tahsl or important place. 41.     As soon as plague occurs in any tahsl or important place, whether the case or cases be indige-                                                                        nous or imported, the District Magistrate shall at once report the fact by telegram to the Commissioner of the Division, as well as to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Home Department, and to the Judicial and General Secretary to the Government of the Punjab When indigenous cases have occurred in a place and it is clear that the disease has taken root locally the place shall be declared infected, and it shall not be declared free of plague till three weeks have elapsed from the date on which the last case of plague occurred in it. The head-quarters of a district or tahsl, a Cantonment, towns of over 50,000 inhabitants and other places, such as Klka and important Railway centres, like Lla Msa, in which it is desirable that the progress of plague should be kept under special observation, shall be considered important places. Village or town register and returns of plague occur- rences. Village or Town Register of Plague  Occurrences- (Form No. 1). 42. (1)  From the date on which plague occurs in any place, if the place infected be a Municipal town a clerk selected by the Municipal Committee for the duty, and if the place be a village the Patwri (for whom the Deputy Commissioner shall provide such assistance as may be necessary in special circles or at special seasons) shall maintain a daily register of infor- mation in connexion with the outbreak. Each daily entry in the register shall relate to the period from sunset on the previous day to sunset on the date under which the entry is made, and the register shall be maintained in Form No. I appended. (2) All Civil and Medical Officers attached to the district shall, if possible, inspect the Village or Town Register of Plague Occurrences on the occasion of any visit to the village or town concerned, and shall, make enquiries to check its correctness, giving immediate information to the District Plague Medical Officer of any errors which they may discover. Daily    Village  or   Town  Plague  Returns-(Form Nos. II and III). (3)    Directly the entries for each date in the Village or Town Register of Plague Occurrences have                                                                     been closed, the Patwri or other person responsible for the maintenance of the register shall prepare two copies of a return in Form No. II appended and one copy of a return in Form No. III, and he shall, the first thing in the morning after the date to which the entries relate, post the copies of Form No. II to the addresses of the Deputy Commissioner and the Executive Plague Officer, and the copy of Form No. III to the District Plague Medical Officer, or send the copies to them by messenger if the returns will reach the officers concerned by messenger more quickly than by post. Until an infected place is declared free a report that Returns Nos. II and III are blank shall be submitted for every day on which no plague occurrence is entered in Register No. 1. When a village is declared free Register No. I shall be sent to the District Plague Medical Officer. Village or Town  Plague Return of weekly Totals- (Form No. IV). (4)    At the end of every week at the time of submitting his Plague Return in Form No.III, or his report that the Return is blank, the Patwri or other official responsible for the maintenance of the Register of Plague Occurrences in Form No. I shall, for the week ending at sunset on the previous Saturday, submit to the District Plague Medical Officer a Village or Town Plague Return of Weekly Totals in Form No. IV appended. (5) Deputy Commissioners shall, if necessary, make arrangements to supply Patwrs with service labels or have messengers put at their disposal by the village in order to ensure the prompt submission of their returns. Inoculating Officers' Registers and Returns. Registers of Particulars of Inoculated Persons- 43.    (1)    Each Inoculating Officer will maintain  registers of Inoculations, giving the names and other particulars of inoculated persons, in forms appended. The correct maintenance of these registers, is essential in order that the results of inoculation may be ascertained, and great care should be taken to see that the entries are made promptly and carefully.. Whenever the fact that an inoculated person has been attacked by plague comes to the notice of the Inoculating Officer, the necessary entry shall be made in Statement No. 6 of the Inoculation Register, and Statement No. 4 of the register will also be entered up. All entries made in Statement No. 4 during each month shall be copied at the end of the month and the copy shall be forwarded to the Plague Medical. Officer. Each Inoculation Register contains space in Statement No. 6 for the entry of the names of 3,000 inoculated persons. When this statement has been filled up the entries on the front page and in Statements Nos 1 and 2 must be completed. Entries should be made in Statements Nos. 3 and 5 as. opportunities occur. In all places where in this register space is left for the name of the Inoculating Medical. Officer his number should also be recorded.
?xxxviii Inoculating Officer's Daily Register of    the  number of Inoculations performed-(Form No. V). (2) Each Inoculating Officer shall maintain a daily register of the number of inoculations performed by him, the daily period for the  purpose of this register being reckoned to extend from  midnight to midnight. The Inoculating Officer's Daily Register of the number of Inoculations performed shall be in Form No. V appended. Inoculating Officer's Tahsl Alphabetical Register - (Form No. VI). (3) As soon as possible after the inoculation operations for each day are completed the number of inoculations done in each village shall be entered up in the Inoculating Officer's Tahsl Alphabetical Register, so as to show the Serial Nos. in the detailed Inoculation Register under which the persons inoculated from each village have been entered. It is important that this should be properly done, in order to facilitate enquiries into the occurrence of plague cases among inoculated persons. Inoculating Officer's Daily Returns of  Inoculations performed-(Form No. VII). (4) As early as possible on the day following that to which the entries in his Daily Register of the number of Inoculations performed relate, each Inocu- lating Officer shall post to the Deputy Commissioner, the Executive Plague Officer, and the District Plague Medical Officer, or send them by messenger, if this is quicker, Daily Returns of Inoculations performed in Form No. VII appended. To save labour this return should be prepared in triplicate by the use of carbon paper, which will be supplied to Inoculating Officers, Inoculating    Officer's  Return  of Weekly  Total  of Inoculations performed-(Form No. VIII). (5) At the end of every week, in addition to his Daily Return of Inoculations performed, each Inoculating Officer shall submit to the District Plague Medical Officer a Return of Weekly Totals of Inocula- tions performed by him in the week ending at midnigtht on Saturday, in Form No. VIII appended. (6) In case any Inoculating Officer performs private inoculations on the payment of fees he shall fill up the particulars prescribed in Forms Nos. IX and X, and shall observe the directions contained in para- graphs 31 and 33 above. Daily Tahsl Register of Plague Occurrences and In- oculations-(Form No. XI). Daily Register  of work performed by Inoculators- (Form No. XII), 44.  (1) Directly on the receipt of the Daily Village or Town Plague Returns and  of  the District Plague  Medical Officer's Registers and  Inoculating  Officer's Daily Return  of the number Returns.                                                                       of Inoculations performed the District Plague  Medical Officer will cause the village totals of cases, deaths, and inoculations, to be enterd up in a Tahsl Daily Register of Plague Occurrences and Inoculations, in Form No. XI, appended, and he will also cause to be entered up in Form No. XII appended a Daily Register of work performed by Inoculators. A separate Register, No. XI, shall be maintained for each tahsl. Register No. XII shall not be maintained by tahsls, but for the district as a whole. When any person is shown in a Daily Return as having died of plague, and such person has not previously been entered as attacked, the plague occurrence shall be entered in Register No. XI both as a case and as a death. Tahsl     Alphabetical     List     of    Villages-(Form No. XIII). (2) The District Plague Medical Officer shall keep  up a Tahsl Alphabetical List of Villages in Form No. XIII appended, and shall reference in it, as soon as they are made, all entries in Register XI. He shall also note in it the number of inoculations performed among the inhabitants of the village on each occasion when any such inoculations are performed, indicating the Inoculating Officer by his serial number. It is important that this should be done in order that plague occurrences among inoculated persons may be readily traced. A complete alphabetical list of the villages in the tahsl shall be entered up in this register to start with, and the necessary entries should be made in columns 3, 4 and 5 of the register at the time when the entries relating to the villages concerned are made in Register XI or any of its inhabitants are shown as inoculated in Return No. VII. District Daily Plague  Return-(Form   No. XIV). (3) As early as possible on the day after that to which the entries in the Tahsl Daily  Register of Plague Occurrences and Inoculations relate the District Plague Medical Officer shall cause to be prepared from the totals in the Register a District Daily Plague Return in Form No. XIV appended, which shall be posted or otherwise sent to the Chief Plague Medical Officer, and the Deputy Commissioner, so as to reach them with the least possible delay. (4) The District Plague Medical Officer will check the weekly totals of the entries in his registers in Forms Nos. XI and XII with the totals reported in the returns in Forms Nos. IV and VIII, and any discrepancies, other than such as have already been brought to notice and satisfactorily settled, shall be noted for enquiry. District Plague Medical Officer's Telegraphic Weekly Plague Return-(Form No. XV). (5) As soon as the weekly totals in the Register in Form No. XI have been ascertained, and not   later than on Monday morning in each week, the District Plague Medical Officer shall submit a Weekly Tele- graphc Plague Return (Fo m No. XV appended) to the Chief Plague Medical Officer. This return need not be sent by telegram if it will reach its destination as quickly otherwise. The return should give merely the date of the last day of the week to which it relates and the total number of cases and deaths that have occurred in the whole district during the week. Details by tahsls should not be given in this return, but it is very important that there should be no delay in its submission as it is required for a weekly Provincial report to the Government of India, which must, under the orders of the Government of India, be despatched so as to reach them not later than on Tuesday morning. Weekly Return by Tahsls  of   Cases,   Deaths,  and Inoculations-(Form No. XVI.) (6) Directly after the despatch of the Weekly Telegraphic  Plague  Return  giving district totals  of cases and deaths only, the District Plague Medical Officer shall send to the Commissioner, the Chief Plague Medical Officer, and the Deputy Commissioner a Weekly Return by Tahsls of Cases, Deaths, and Inoculations, in Form No. XVI appended, This will be prepared from weekly totals obtained from the entries in Registers XI and XII.
?xxxix Tahsl Detailed Village Weekly Plague and Inocula- tion Return-(Form No. XVII). (7) The District Plague Medical Officer shall cause to be prepared from the Tahsl Daily Plague Register in Form No.  XI  a  Tahsl  Detailed  Village Weekly Plague and Inoculation Return in the appended .                                                      Form No. XVII. This return shall be sent to the Chief Plague Medical Officer, with a weekly diary according to the instruction in paragraph 47 below. (8) Any corrections that may be found necessary in the figures reported in the District Plague Medical Officer's Telegraphic Weekly Plague Return or in any other return should be promptly communicated by the District Plague Medical Officer to the officers who have been supplied with copies of the returns requiring correction. The corrections need not be communicated by telegram. Register of Cash received from   Inoculating Officers - (Form No. XVIII). (9) The District Plague Medical Officer shall maintain a register in Form No. XVIII appended for the record of the receipt and payment into the Treasury of sums  paid  to  Inoculating  Officers  for  private inoculations  and remitted by them to the District Plague Medical Officer.  Payments into the Treasury shall be made without delay. Plague Medical Officers' Despatch, Invoice and Re- ceipt Form and Register. Plague  Medical  Officers'   Despatch,  Invoice and Receipt Form-(Form No XX) Register of Returns III sent for verification and of Indent, Despatch and Receipt of Apparatus, &c. - (Form No XXI). 45.    Inoculating Officers shall attach to their daily returns No. VII a return, in Form  No. XX, of Plague Reports sent them for verification and of prophy- lactic, apparatus, &c., required, received, or despatched. The same form shall be used by the District Plague Medical Officer in sending reports, prophylactic or ap- paratus, to Inoculating Officers or acknowledging the receipt of the same. Both the Inoculating Officers and the District Plague Medical Officers shall keep up in Form No. XXI a register of Returns III sent for verifi- cation and of Indent, Despatch, and Receipt of apparatus, &c. Action to be taken on and  method of disposing of Daily Village of Town Plague Returns 46.    (1) As soon as possible after the receipt of the Daily Village or Town Plague Returns the District Plague Medical Officer will select a number of cases or villages, if there be any, in respect of which enquiry seems to be desirable and shall issue orders for an enquiry into the selected cases or villages directly to the Inoculating Officer, Hospital Assistant, or other Medical Officer by whom the enquiry can most conveniently be made. The officer receiving such orders shall enquire and report to the District Plague Medical Officer without delay, and on receiving this report the District Plague Medical Officer shall, if necessary, cause the entries made in the Tahsl Daily Register of Plague Occurrences to be altered in red ink, noting in the column for remarks the reason for the alteration. Similar alterations shall be made if, without enquiry being ordered, errors are discovered and reported to the District Plague Medical Officer by any Medical or Civil Officer after inspection of the Daily Village or Town Register of Plague Occurrences. (2) After the necessary details from Return No. III has been noted in the District Plague Medical Officer's Register No. XI, and directions for any enquiries deemed necessary have issued, the District Plague Medical Officer shall send the Return No. III to the officer, or if there is more than one, then in succession, if necessary, to the officers by whom inoculations have been performed on persons belonging to the village to which the Return relates. The names of the patients entered in the Return shall be checked with the nominal roll of inoculated persons, and any omission or mistake in recording the inoculation of any patient shall be brought to the notice of the District Plague Medical Officer, who will correct the figures in his Register No. XI accordingly. (3) The following is an example of what will be required. The District Plague Medical Officer receives the Daily Plague Report from village A in which there is an entry that B has been attacked with plague. The number of B's inoculation certificate is stated to be x/y, y being the Inoculating Medical Officer's number. The District Plague Medical Officer accordingly sends the Return to Y, who, on its receipt, looks up in his inoculation register the number of the certificate, X. If B is found to be recorded as inocu- lated, the Inoculating Officer makes the necessary entry in the register, and after endorsing as " verified," with his initials, the entry concerning B on the Daily Plague Return, he then sends back the Return to the District Plague Medical Officer. It will very frequently happen, however, that in the Daily Plague Return a person will be shown as having been inoculated, but the number of his inoculation certi- ficate will not be quoted. Under these circumstances the District Plague Medical Officer will look up in his Tahsl Alphabetical Register village A, and he will see that inoculator Y has inoculated most persons there. He will therefore send the report to Y, who on receipt of it will look up village A in his Tahsl Alphabetical Register and find that the Serial No. of inoculated persons in village A are, for example, 27, 190-250, 5,834- 6,761. He will look through these entries and, if he. finds B's name, will make the necessary entries against it, and will then enter and initial on the Plague Return against B's name the number and date of his inoculation certificate. In case he fails to find B's name in his inoculation register, he will note against it on the Daily Plague Return "unverified" and sign his initials. In both cases he will  send the Daily Plague Return back to the District Plague Medical Officer as soon as possible. Medical Officer's Diary - (Form No  XIX). 47.    A weekly diary shall be submitted by all Medical Officers together with their weekly returns. The diaries of all Medical Officers working under the orders of the District Plague Medical Officer will be submitted to this officer, who, after endorsing on them any remarks he may have to make, will forward them with his own to the Chief Plague Medical Officer, Punjab, at the time of despatching his weekly returns. The diary should be written on the form supplied, which is merely a half sheet of foolscap, with a heading and margin for notes and binding. This form is printed on thin paper to permit of a copy being made with carbon paper, the original being written in pencil and retained, and the copy forwarded. Only one side of the paper is to be written on. The diary should be written in a narrative form, an entry being made for each day, recording briefly the writer's work and the places visited by him, as well as any unusual occurrences. Either here or in a weekly sum- mary, as may be found most convenient, attention should be drawn to any noticeable features in connection with individual towns or villages and to any matters of special interest. All entries should be as concise as possible, compatably with the object of the diary, which is the maintenance of a clear and precise con- temporaneous record of circumstances and events connected with plague for the prompt and regular information of those engaged in directing measures for dealing with the disease.  In order to give scope
?x1 for individuality but few directions are given concerning the method of writing the diary; attention is,, however, invited to the notes printed under the heading of Form No. XIX containing an extract from a letter concerning the submission of reports on plague operations, which will afford an indication of points which it is desirable to notice. It should be understood that in the diary reference is to be made only to such matters as have happened or have been noticed during the week. Executive Plague  Officer's   Register  and  Weekly Report Executive Plague Officer's Register of Plague infor- mation-(Form No. XXII). 48.    (1) The Executive Plague Officer shall maintain for his charge a register of villages in which plague has occurred or in which inoculation has been introduced or performed since the 1st October 1902. At least one page should be devoted to each village, and entries should be made for villages into which inoculation has been introduced even if plague has not broken out in them. The register will be main- tained in the appended Form No. XXII. Entries in columns, 1 to 6 shall be made from particulars received in the daily returns submitted to the Executive Plague Officer in Forms Nos, 11 and VII, but they will be checked if possible by enquiry in the villages con- cerned and corrected if necessary. All corrections found to be necessary shall be promptly communicated to the District Plague Medical Officer, and corrections intimated by the District Plague Medical Officer shall be noted in the register. Executive Plague Officer's  Weekly Plague  Report - (Form No  XXIII). (2) Every Tuesday the Executive Plague  Officer will submit through the Deputy Commissioner and Commissioner to the Judicial and General Secretary to the Punjab Government direct, at Lahore or Simla as the case may be, a Weekly Plague Report in the Form No. XXIII appended. The figures in this weekly report will be those for the week ending on the Saturday week before the date of the report, but the remarks should be brought as much up to date as possible. After the reports have been perused, such orders as the Lieutenant-Governor may direct will issue upon them, being accompanied by extracts from the reports where necessary, and the reports will then be forwarded to the Chief Plague Medical Officer for record and reference in his office and for use in the preparation of the Annual Plague Report. Deputy Commissioners and Revenue officials to give assistance necessary for preparation of returns, &c. 49. Deputy Commissioners and all Revenue officials of infected districts should give every assis- tance that may be required in preparing the prescribed registers and keeping them correct and up to date. These registers and returns have been prescribed with a view to give the most complete and immediate infor- mation to all authorities who are concerned in the administration of plague measures, and in order to enable the results of inoculation to be followed up. It is particularly in order to serve this last purpose, and to complete the chain of investigation, and thereby secure a very large ultimate saving of time and labour, that the registers numbered I, II, VI, XIII and XXI have been prescribed. With operations of the magnitude now being undertaken in the Punjab it is incumbent on Government to make every effort to follow up the results of inoculation, and in order to do so it is essential that there should be a current record both of the number of operations and of the plague incidence and fatality among inoculated and uninocu- lated persons. Unless plague occurrences among the inoculated are brought on to the inoculation records as they occur, it will be impossible to obtain accurate statistics of relative incidence, and unless the statis- tics are collated at least every week the ultimate examination of the accumulated mass of records would give results that could not be checked and would be a difficult matter, involving much labour and time. For these reasons it is absolutely essential that all the records prescribed for submission to or preparation by Medical Officers should be carefully and promptly maintained. It is, however, possible that the returns prescribed with the object of keeping Civil Officers informed of the state of affairs may be more than they require. Thus some Deputy Commissioners may prefer to dispense with daily returns direct from Patwrs and Inoculating Officers in Forms Nos. II and VII and may be content with the District Plague Medical Officer's returns in Form No. XIV and with weekly details concerning infected places in Forms Nos. IV and VIII. They may therefore dispense with such of the returns prescribed for submission to them as they may not require. In addition to the returns prescribed above Deputy Commissioners will receive such information regarding the outbreak and progress of infection in the villages of their district as they may direct their Revenue subordinates to submit, but they should not prescribe daily or other periodical reports of statistics and should not call for any returns not prescribed for submission to them, e.g., the return in Form No. XVII, unless arrangements can be made for copying these returns by mechanical means. 50.    If any return is blank, the form need not be submitted, but a blank return  statement should be sent in to that effect. Registers and Returns obtainable by indent on  Dis- infection Dept, Jullundur. 51.    Forms for all the Registers and Returns prescribed above will be supplied by Government on requisition to the Superintendent  of the Disinfection. Dept at Jullundur.
