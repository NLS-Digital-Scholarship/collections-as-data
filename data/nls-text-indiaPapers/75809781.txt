SIR, I AM directed to forward for the information of the Government of India a copy of the report of the Civil Veterinary Department for the year 1911-12 together with an extract from the forwarding letter No. 1258A.T., dated the 1st August 1912, from the Director of Agriculture in Bihar and Orissa with which it was received. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient Servant, J. F. GRUNING, Secretary to the Government of Bihar and Orissa.
Extract from a letter No. 1258 A.T., dated the 1st August 1912, from Mr. W.B. Heycock, Director of Agriculture, Bihar and Orissa. * * * * * * * 2. Mr. Quinlan was in charge of the Veterinary Department throughout the year with the exception of two short periods, on the first of which he was absent on privilege leave and on the second was on duty at the Delhi Durbar as Veterinary Officer to the Volunteer Contingent. On both occasions Colonel Raymond acted for him, in addition to his own duties as Principal, Bengal Veterinary College. 3. The introduction of the Provincial Veterinary Service, with effect from the 1st April 1911, has improved the prospects of the Veterinary Depart" ment considerably and must lead to greater efficiency. Its effects will be felt more fully year by year. The constitution of the new Province of Bihar and Orissa and the abolition of the post of the Inspector-General of the Civil Veterinary Department scarcely come within the purview of the year under report. The criticism passed on the latter measure by the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, is out of place and should not have found a place in his report. 4. It is to be regretted that the students presenting themselves for ad- mission at the Bengal Veterinary College are few in number and backward. Possibly the introduction of the new Provincial Veterinary Service may lead to a better class of students applying for admission. The prospects, however, of Veterinary Assistants, especially of Itinerant Veterinary Assistants, must be improved if better men are to be secured. The travelling allowance of Itinerant Veterinary Assistants has been fixed too low to enable them to meet their expenses on tour. The life, too, which the Itinerant Veterinary Assistant has to lead, constantly touring in the interior, is a hard and un- attractive one. Proposals will be submitted shortly for raising the travelling allowance of Itinerant Veterinary Assistants. 5. There has been a decided improvement in the reporting of outbreaks of cattle disease. Members of Agricultural Associations and private people are gradually realising the importance of promptly reporting cases and are more ready to assist in bringing outbreaks to the notice of the authorities. Unfortunately the number of Itinerant Veterinary Assistants is still far too small and all outbreaks cannot be attended. In most districts more Itinerant Veterinary Assistants are required. Unless outbreaks reported are regularly attended there must naturally be some slackness in reporting. Readiness to report must depend largely on the belief that all outbreaks reported will be attended. 6. The remarks in the report of the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, under Table III, paragraph 1, indicate that all the outbreaks reported during the year, viz., 128, were attended. Such, however, is not the case. The total number of outbreaks actually reported was 1,070. Of these, 707 are reported to have been attended. The figure 128 represents only the outbreaks attended at which inoculation was consented to. The large number of outbreaks reported but not attended emphasizes the necessity of increasing the number of Itinerant Veterinary Assistants. No doubt Itinerant Veterinary Assistants have not attended as many outbreaks as they should have done. Still with every effort on their part it was impossible for them to attend all the outbreaks reported. 7. The misleading nature of the figures quoted is due to the fact that no register has hitherto been kept dealing with all outbreaks. The only register of outbreaks kept hitherto has been the inoculation register which deals only with outbreaks in which inoculation was resorted to. No register is kept giving details of the numerous other outbreaks which were reported. The figures given above have been collected from the diaries which contain merely a statement of the number of outbreaks reported and attended. A register under my instructions has now been opened to show all outbreaks
2 reported. To give a true idea of the incidence of cattle disease in the Province it is also advisable to make a slight addition to Table III and insert two additional columns after column 4, the headings of which should be as follows :ANNUAL REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BENGAL, FOR THE YEAR 1911-12. PREFACE AND GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. During the year under report I held charge of the Veterinary Depart- ment, Bengal, except for two short periods when I was on privilege leave and attending the Delhi Durbar as Veterinary Officer to the Volunteer Contingent. Colonel Raymond on both occasions acted for me in addition to his own duties. The report herewith submitted deals exclusively with that part of my charge which now constitutes the new Province of Bihar and Orissa, that on the work in the Bengal Districts being contributed by Major Smith, Principal of the Veterinary College and Superintendent of the Veterinary Department, Bengal. The year which has drawn to a close has brought about many changes : First, the introduction of the Provincial Veterinary Service on the 1st April 1911; second, the partition of Bengal with 33 districts, into the new Province of Bihar and Orissa with 21 districts (the remainder being allotted to Bengal); and third the proposed abolition of the post of Inspector- General, Civil Veterinary Department, and placing the Department in India under the Agricultural Adviser to the Government of India. As regards the hearing of the first two questions on the general effici- ency of the Department in this Province, they will, I believe, be followed by marked improvement in the class of Assistant admitted and in the work of the Assistants and Staff in general. In respect of the third, it is unnecessary to make any remarks except that it is a step which leads anywhere but toward progress. Tours were made in most districts of the Province to enquire into the work of the Veterinary Assistants and the Cattle Farms at Siripur and Bettiah were inspected. Fairs at Sonepore, Bihta, Raghunathpore and Ranchi were also attended. I was on tour for 174 days and travelled 13,384 miles by rail and 833 miles by road. PART I. VETERINARY INSTRUCTION. From this Province very few students presented themselves at the Bengal Veterinary College for admission, and at the end of the year there remained2 have had little or no connection with agriculture and consequently do not come into the Department with any great liking for it, though some have exceeded expectations. It appears to be desirable that the prospects offered to them should be reconsidered, and, that an increase of pay and travelling allowance is necessary, if the cadre is to improve in the future. There are so many openings in other Departments, and in commerce, that only those take to the Veterinary profession for a living, who in many cases are not good enough to obtain appointments. Good Assistants are badly needed in all districts of the Province. PART II. TREATMENT OF DISEASE. Although outbreaks of cattle disease have been reported more regularly than formerly, there is still a great deal to be done to bring the system into proper working order. The various Associations during the year have had frequent attention drawn to the necessity of reporting disease. Greater in- terest is however being taken in reporting, both by members of the Agricul- tural Associations and by private people. In Bihar many Planters do not take as much interest as they might do, in sending information, and in helping to suppress disease. In Champaran, however, very considerable assistance has been afforded to the Veterinary Assistants by them, in inoculation work, especially against hæmorrhagic septicaemia, and in the treatment of foot-and-mouth disease in the villages, by distributing medicines. Until a sufficient number of Assistants are avail- able very little can be done in attending all outbreaks as the areas to be covered are too large. EQUINES. Disease of a contagious character among equines this year has been remarkably low, only one case of glanders (previously tested with mallein), at Bhagalpur, being recorded. No information is available regarding the 9 deaths from "other contagious disease" and they could not on this account be classified. BOVINES. Rinderpest.3 Black Quarter.4 subdivisions, and one for the Bihar district of Patna, Government sanction for them was, however, not received until March, and, as they could not then be filled up, the figures for Gaya represent the work of the Itinerant Veterinary Assistant Sadr only. The Veterinary Assistant of Bihar was appointed only at the end of March. Altogether 9,543 villages were visited against 10,411 of the previous year while 44,779 patients were treated against 34,778 of 1910-11, showing a total increase of 10,001 cases which is satisfactory. The above figures represent new cases only and have been subject to frequent scrutiny by Inspectors. While there has been an increase in most instances, Dinapur, Bettiah, Arraria, Dumka, Sahibganj, Khurda, Hazaribagh, Giridih, and Ranchi show a decrease. Except in the case of Ranchi and Khurda no explanation appears necessary as the Assistants have been doing good work but in the district of Ranchi from want of proper supervision, the Veterinary As- sistant did but little work and sent in his resignation which was not accepted until enquiries, which were not finished at the end of the year, had been made. In the case of Angul, Puri, the Khonclmahals, Begusarai, North Bhagalpur, etc., very large increases have been recorded due to extensive outbreaks of foot- and-mouth disease. The Itinerant Veterinary Assistants of Purnea, Cuttack, Champaran, Buxar, Dinapur, Giridih, Dhanbaid, Bargarh, Angul, Muzaffarpur, and Sitamarhi performed their duties satisfactorily. Additional Assistants are urgently needed in Cuttack, Balasore, Puri, Champaran (Sadr), Shahabad, Patna (Sadr), Monghyr (Sadr), Purnea (Kissenganj), Saran (Sadr and Gopalganj), and Darbhanga (Samastipur), as it is found impossible for one Assistant to treat satisfactorily outbreaks which are situated at widely separated parts of the same district. Medicine depôts are being opened wherever funds can be found to furnish them ; medi- cines are also more freely distributed than formerly and with satisfactory results. TABLES V AND VI. HOSPITALS AND DISPENSARIES. At the beginning of the year there were 20 hospitals, excluding the Hazaribagh Pinjrapole. One new hospital was opened at Motihari and the Raj hospital at Bettiah was completed during the year. The Begusarai hos- pital has not been taken over by the District Board from the donor owing to the inferior manner in which it was constructed. The work in the majority of the hospitals has been satisfactory, specially in Bettiah, Motihari, Bhagalpur, Muzaffarpur, Purnea, Cuttack, Bankipore, and Laheria Serai. The dispensary at Palamau was closed; the manner in which the Veterinary Assistants at Purulia and Dumka did their duty was not satisfactory. During the period under report 6,503 horses, 15,525 bovines, and 4,653 others, or a total number of 26,681, were treated against 19,020 of the previous year or an increase of 7,661 cases. It is satisfactory to record that the shoeing forges in Purnea, Ranchi, Motihari, Gaya and Monghyr are doing so well. At Bhagalpur and Hazari- bagh, though a large number of horses were shod, they closed the year with a slight loss. The most unsatisfactory feature about them is the fact that so few wealthy and educated native gentlemen, private or in Government em- ploy, take advantage of them although the fees charged are no greater than the bazar rate. The result is that many horses are permanently lamed by the manner in which the bazar Nalbands shoe them. Shoeing forges will, it is hoped, be started in every headquarters station, if they can be worked without a loss. BREEDING OPERATIONS. Table VIII shows the number of stud bulls maintained in various districts of the Province. Applications for bulls for breeding purposes con- tinued to be received during the year, and in some instances they were complied with. In the majority of cases, however, nothing could be done as good Brahmini bulls are no longer available. The Darpan Wards Estates obtained a Nellore bull through the Department.
5 Twelve buffalo bull calves purchased in the Punjab for Government, were kept at the Siripur Farm and Rs. 1,241 was expended on their keep. They have done exceedingly well, except one, which is rather underbred and small. Two were sold to the District Boards of Patna and Muzaffarpur, and one to the Muksudpur Wards Estate at Rs. 150, Rs. 150 and Rs. 90, respect- ively, the proceeds being credited to Government. The remaining bulls were not disposed of, but the Manager of the Bettiah Raj, has asked for four which will be sent him on receipt of the sanction he requires for their purchase. BULL REARING AND BREEDING FARMS. There is now only one farm in this Province where bulls are bred for use in the districts. It is maintained by the Bettiah Raj. At the begin- ning of the year there were two, but the Siripur Farm with its fine herd, got together after much trouble and expense, was disbanded as it was about to show good results, and the young bulls converted into high class cart bullocks, the reason being that the estate passed from the Court of Wards to the Maharani of Hathwa during January last. As regards Bettiah, this farm is not doing as well as was expected, change of climate and soil having affected the animals considerably. A conference was held at Bettiah in the cold weather to consider the question of the loca- tion of the farm, and it was decided that the herd should be removed permanently from Manjheria to some land near the Manager's bungalow, which appears suitable. The herd at the close of the year numbered 103 head ; of these there were 20 bulls and bull calves, 42 cows and 41 young stock. Twenty-one rejected stock were sold for Rs. 393-8-0. Twenty-six calves were born during the year while 2 cows and 7 calves died. The Manager, Mr. J. R. Lowis, takes considerable interest in the farm but it is impossible to go on with the farm in its present state, unless some reliable and experienced person, preferably a European, is placed in charge. Unless this is done, it will mean the Superintendent having to visit the farm at least every two months. The Veterinary Assistant, who has a large practice now to look after, was intended for this post in addition to his legitimate work, but, as this has grown to considerable proportions since he was appointed, the farm cannot properly be looked after while the Manager and the Assistant Managers have other considerable duties to perform in connection with the estate and are therefore precluded from giving the farm the attention it requires. The whole question of making provision for cattle-breeding in this Province is now under enquiry by the Director of Agriculture and it is hoped that a plan will be formulated which will be workable and provide for the necessities of the Province for some years to come. The main ques- tions at issue are the provision of Government Cattle Farms in Bihar and Orissa ; and the best method of disposing of the bulls. I trust that Govern- ment will favourably consider these Proposals. HORSE AND PONY STALLION. The only horse stallion of the Province is maintained by the Dumraon Raj. No mares were covered during the year. A sum of Rs. 190 was spent for its feed and keep. TABLES XIII AND XIV. Particulars of the principal Pairs and Shows in the Province are given in Tables XIII and XIV. As usual, I visited Sonepur Fair and purchased three elephants for the Government of Madras. The market being unfavourable, only two could be secured at an average price of Rs. 2,712 each. Babu S. C. Pal, the tem- porary Deputy Superintendent, also attended this fair.
6 The other fairs of note were Bihta, Barapur, Dharmganj, and Khagra, of which the first two were visited by me and the others by the Deputy Superintendent and the Inspectors. Arrangements have been made whereby temporary dispensaries are now provided at each fair. SUBORDINATE VETERINARY ESTABLISHMENT. Table VII shows the strength of the Subordinate Veterinary Establish- ment. At the end of the year there were five Inspectors and 62 Veterinary Assistants, excluding the Assistant in charge of Hazaribagh Pinjrapole, against 56 (including 5 reserve Assistants) of the previous year. Besides the above, one Deputy Superintendent, Babu S. C. Pal, First Glanders Inspector, was employed for 7 months, from September 1911 to March 1912, on a salary Rs. 1507 Cruelty to animals appears to be a dead letter in most Municipalities, though the Department has offered the assistance of Inspectors and Assistants at the granting of licenses and their advice is taken at the time, rejected ponies are afterwards given a license by interested parties, especially in those Municipalities which are under native supervision. It is almost impossible to speak restrainedly of the manner in which ponies suffering from wounds, galls, lameness, and old age are allowed to ply for hire, and of the callousness displayed by educated native gentlemen to the cruelty that goes on around them. Gaya, Cuttack, Bankipore, Monghyr, Bhagalpur, and a number of the smaller Municipalities are the principal places where such practices exist. The Act which deals with such offences appears to be useless, as fines, which are readily paid, are the only punishment adopted. There appear to be only two methods of dealing with this question: (1) destruction of horses certified as unfit for work, (2) sending the others to a hospital until they are again able to be put to use. It appears to be desirable that all animals and carriages plying for hire in the mufassil as well as in Municipalities should be licensed and subjected to inspection by the Veterinary Assistants and Inspectors of the Department. Stable accommodation in Municipalities should also be considered in connection with future sanitation schemes. In most instances stables are kept in a very bad state, no proper system of drainage is provided, while, as a rule, they are situated in crowded quarters of the town. D.

PREFACE AND GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. THE supervision of the Veterinary Department of this Province was in my charge during the past year: and also, for a short period during April, the Districts in the Presidency and Burdwan Divisions of Bengal, until I was relieved by Major Smith, the present Principal of the Bengal Veterinary College. The headquarters of the Department at the beginning of the year were located in Ranchi, but in July, for want of sufficient accommodation, they were transferred to the Old Jail Buildings at Bhagalpur. The office is now located in a hired bungalow near the river. Tours were undertaken in most of the districts to enquire into the work of the Assistants and into outbreaks of cattle disease. A special tour was made, in company with the Director of Agriculture, in the Muzaffarpur and Darbhanga districts, to enquire into the reasons for the antipathy shown to inoculation by many Hindu villagers. I visited the south of the Ranchi District in February to enquire into the presence of the cattle disease there, and inspected the Siripur Farm once, and the Bettiah Farm on three occasions. I attended the Bengal Veterinary College as an Examiner at the annual examinations; and also the Sonepur and Ranchi Fairs. I was on tour for 250 days and travelled 12,442 miles by rail and 2,059 miles by road. I should like to emphasise here the necessity of providing for another Imperial Officer. It is impossible for satisfactory work to be undertaken and carried to a successful issue when one's efforts are dissipated over so wide an area as the present province. Veterinary Assistants wish for and expect the supervision and advice of such an officer, and though it might cost more to provide an additional Superintendent, the increased efficiency would un- doubtedly compensate for the extra expenditure. PART I. VETERINARY INSTRUCTION. The number of students from this province who were on the roll of the Bengal Veterinary College at the end of the year under report was as follows :2 Of these 9 were Biharis, 6 Oriyas and the remainder came from Chota Nagpur. According to religion there were 9 Hindus, 6 Mahomedans and 2 Christians. I regret to state that the majority of these young men are very inferior in physique and intelligence. There appears to he at present an un- accountable lack of interest displayed in taking up appointments in the Depart- ment on the part of the students of the larger schools and colleges. This year early notices were issued to District Boards, colleges and influential Indian gentlemen, asking for candidates, hut although the District Boards offered sti- pends, very few young men availed themselves of them, and many of those who were accepted withdrew their names when they were asked to join at Belgachia. In many cases the applicants were inferior in physique and general education, hut the question of pay and prospects as compared with other cervices in which manual labour is not so strenuous as in the Veterinary Department, and also the Bihari's antipathy to go outside his own Province, especially to Calcutta, for educational purposes, have no doubt a deterrent effect on would-be aspirants to the Department. In a way this is a blessing, for it has been apparent for some time, that some other recruits than those of the writer caste, who form a large proportion of the applicants, are required, if the Department is to get on. I believe it would be to the advantage of the Department to establish a college in Bankipore or Muzaffarpur for training its own Veterinary Assistants; or failing that, in the United Provinces in conjunction with the Government of those Provinces. Again, the language in practically the whole of Bihar and Orissa is Hindi, and as only a very small minority speak or write English, and as the class from whom the Assistants should come live in the mufassal, a very strong case is made out for the establishment of a college in this province, where the teaching would be done in the vernacular. In the Punjab the Veterinary Course is in Urdu, and the result has been that the Department in that Province is able to recruit from the best classes, and especially from among those who are most intimately connected with agriculture, and who would hot have been available had the course been confined to English-speaking and writing candidates. I am strongly of opinion that unless a student has a very thorough knowledge of English he wastes a great deal of his time in trying to gather sense from the lectures and from the English works to which he must necessarily refer and in consequence endeavours to memorize without in the least understanding what is meant. Proposals for ten Government stipends for students willing to proceed to the Bengal Veterinary College have been submitted, but sanc- tion has not yet been obtained. It also appears to be necessary that a second Imperial Officer should be appointed for teaching the students at Belgachia, and although the present staff of Indian professors do their best, they have had very little of that practical experience which is so desirable in those who must train the students in the way they should work in the mufassil. The Government of this province should therefore, I suggest, urge the necessity of this increase in the teaching staff. The need for good Assistants was as pressing as ever during the year that has passed, and many more than the four who joined the Department during the period under report could have been given employment if they had been available. PART II. TREATMENT OF DISEASE. Reporting of cattle disease is now placed on a better footing than in previous years owing to the increased interest taken in the Department by most District Officials and by the Police. The representative of the Co-operative Societies of the Roman Catholic Mission in Ranchi, Father Hoffmann, reported at the Co-operative Conference in Simla that disease was very prevalent in that district and caused great loss. An Inspector was deputed to enquire into
3 the outbreaks and his report disclosed evidence of widespread disease, particu- larly Rinderpest and Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia. I visited the south of the district with Father Hoffmann, and although there were no outbreaks at the time, there was ample proof that Hæmorrhagic Septiæmia is the cause of very great mortality among cattle in the Biru tract. Rinderpest does not appear to be so common, as very few cattle-arc brought there from outside. Further enquiries in other parts of Chota Nagpur have shown that Rinder- pest reaches the district through the Native States on the west and from Hazaribagh and Palamau on the north. Though strict enquiries have been made into its prevalence in Gaya, I could get no evidence of any outbreaks having occurred in that district, though there was severe mortality in Shahabad and Palamau. The inference to be derived from this is that the cattle in the plains, which are better fed and looked after, can carry the disease without showing any very striking clinical symptoms themselves, and that they infect the more susceptible cattle of the Chota Nagpur Plateau when brought up there for sale. Disease usually makes its first appearance on the roads leading from the districts to the north and north-west. In the districts of Tirhut Rinderpest has not appeared so far, but the danger is very great, as there is a constant stream of cattle passing through them on their way to Bengal and Assam from the United Provinces during the cold weather months. The dearth of a large staff of Assistants at head-quarters is a constant source of trouble. They would be invaluable in dealing with outbreaks, as they could be deputed to any part of the province at short notice. A new register for keeping statistics of animals that die from contagious disease was introduced in March. The figures given in the attached statement have been obtained mainly from the Police. In future these will be supple- mented by those which the Assistant will have obtained himself when on tour, but which have not been reported by the chaukidars. New rules are also being drawn up with a view to eliminating many sources of error in the present system. EQUINES. Three outbreaks of Glanders were reported during the year, one from Jamui, District Monghyr, one from Ranchi and one from Giridih. After test- ing the suspected animals with Mallein they were found free from the disease. The 14 deaths from " Other diseases " could not be classified for want of parti- culars. BOVINES. Rinderpest.4 most fatal with which cattle owners have to deal in India. Ranchi district shows the highest mortality, but this, I believe is due to the fact that considerable attention has been paid to reporting in the past twelve months, and to the in- terest displayed by the Superintendent of Police. Balasore, Cuttack, and Muzaffarpur show a relatively heavy mortality. Every effort is being made, with the staff available, to inoculate as many cattle as possible. Black Quarter.5 Rinderpest.6 The Veterinary Assistants of Purulia and Balasore were dismissed for nsatisfactory work and for falsification of their diaries. The need for additional Assistants is most urgent, and many posts were vacant for short periods through the inability of the Department to supply substitutes. TABLES V AND VI. HOSPITALS AND DISPENSARIES. There were 22 hospitals at the close of the year at which patients were treated. The Beguserai hospital has not yet been finished and taken charge of by the District Board. It has been decided to open hospitals at Sewan and Hathwa, and the question of the construction of new buildings at Ranchi is under the consideration of the District Board. They are very urgently required. The work of the Veterinary Hospitals at Ranchi, Bankipore, Gaya, Cuttack, Purnea-, Laheriaserai, Motihari, Bettiah Raj, and Hathwa was very satisfactory. The hospital at Bhagalpur is not gaining in popularity to the extent that one would desire. The shoeing forge attached to it is mainly supported by the European population ; no Indian gentlemen appear to send their animals to it. In fact there is a general want of interest in such matters in all the large towns to the south of the Ganges. During the period under report 7,150 horses, 12,657 bovines, and 5,322 others making a total of 25,159 animals were treated against 26,681 in the pre- vious year7 Five buffalo bull calves, 41 bull calves, 26 cow calves and 40 cows, 8, desi bulls and 12 buffalo bulls were placed in the different factories on the estate during the year. Twenty-eight calves were born and 6 died during the year under report. Seven old cows, 3 heifers and 4 bull calves wore rejected, the cows and heifers realizing Rs. 139 only, while the bull calves, which were valued at Rs. 275, were reserved for the use of the Raj. The present area of the farm comprises 32 acres and is enclosed by a barbed wire fence. An additional plot is being acquired which, when added, will increase the area available for grazing to about 75 acres. As regards improvements carried out during the year, four new sheds and a well with reservoir attached were constructed. Three silo pits were also constructed. Next year the whole area will be divided into 10 acre plots to facilitate the grazing of the different classes of stock. New silos will also be erected, as well as, it is hoped, godowns for grain and fodder. A scheme which has received the assent of the Manager was submitted, and it is hoped that when this is in operation better results will be forthcoming. A Veterinary Overseer has been sanctioned, but considerable difficulty is being experienced in getting a suitable man. During the year a special officer, Mr. G. Milne, I.C.S., was deputed by, Government to enquire into the subject of the improvement of cattle and it is hoped that the information which has been placed at his disposal will have the effect of producing something tangible. Two cattle farms should be provided for8 One of the posts of Inspectors remained vacant throughout the year for the same cause. A new post of Itinerant Veterinary Assistant was created for the Municipalities of Madhupur and Deoghur in the Santal Parganas. Five Veterinary Assistants in the employment of District Boards, viz., 2 in Cuttack, 2 in Sambalpur, 1 (stationary) in Ranchi, two employed in the Government Estates of Angul and the Khondmals, and the Veterinary Assistant at Dumka were brought into the Provincial cadre during the year. It is hoped that the Veterinary Assistants in Bettiah, Hathwa, and Dumraon will also be included during the coming year. The Inspectors continued to hold charge of the jurisdictions to which they were posted in the previous year; the circle head-quarters were at Bhagalpur, Muzaffarpur, Gaya, and Cuttack. Chief Inspector Babu P. N. Das, although nominally in charge of the Bhagalpur Division, toured in different parts of the Province on special enquires in addition to his routine duties. In April while the Presidency and Burdwan Divisions were in my charge, he attended an outbreak of Glanders at Berhampur. He toured for 209 days. I wish to commend his work, which was carried out in a very efficient manner and justified his selection as Chief Inspector, to the notice of Government. Babu B. L. Sur, Inspector of the Muzaffarput* Circle, in addition to his routine work, attended the Pandits' Conference at Rohika, visited the Bettiah and Siripur cattle farms, and purchased 100 ewes for the Military Department at Port Blair. He was on tour for 227 days, travelling 2,976 miles by road and 3,687 by rail. Sirdar Sucha Singh, Inspector of the Gaya Circle, was on tour for 250 days. He was employed for a considerable time in connection with the outbreaks of rinderpest in Sasaram and Palamau. The Inspector of the Orissa Division, Babu D. N. Sarkar, was constantly on tour, but his work is not characterized by anything that would lead one to suspect special ability on his patr. The Inspectors were also deputed to accompany the Special Cattle Survey Officer on his tours, and to give him any information and assistance he required. Although the majority of the Veterinary Assistants showed fair progress, some of them proved to be failures, for instance the Veterinary Assistants of Purnea and Balasore were dismissed, and the Itinerant Assistants of Ranchi, Bhagalpur, and Hajipur resigned as the result of enquiries which were instituted. The Assistants of Damka, Chapra, and Sambalpur did not work satisfactorily and the two latter were transferred. The Department requires a leave reserve urgently, as well as a staff of Assistants who could be sent to the districts to help in the suppression of disease, but at the present time it appears to be hopeless to expect any great increase in the cadre, unless Assistants are recruited from other provinces. The districts named in the last year's report still require Assistants, as they could not be supplied owing to the small number of graduates that quali- fied during the year. RESEARCH WORK No Research work was carried out during the year, but slides, etc., continue to be sent to the Raymond Laboratory at Belgachia, for diagnosis. Seven horses suffering from Kumri were sent to the Imperial Bacteriologist, Muktesar, for experiment. GENERAL REMARKS. Departmental rules for the Guidance of Veterinary Subordinates and for the conduct of Hospitals and Dispensaries were framed during the year, but could not be submitted to Government pending the receipt of the opinions of the local bodies. A Manual of Instruction, laying down the procedure of work for Subordinate Veterinary Officers was also put in hand and will be issued shortly: something of the sort is badly required to bring uniformity into the working of the Depart- meat.
9 Proposals for increasing the travelling allowance of Veterinary Assistants were submitted and it is hoped that they will receive the assent of Government as the present allowance does not cover the expenses or compensate for the hardships which many of them must undergo. An allowance of Re. 1 per day for each day spent on tour, subject to a maximum of Rs. 25 per mensem, should meet the case. Proposals have also been put up for securing to the Veterinary Assistants recognition of their past service as counting for pension. At the request of the Agricultural Adviser to the Government of India a conference was held at Ranchi in February, to discuss Cattle Insurance and the employment of untrained inoculators. The subject is at present in abeyance, but there can be no doubt of the danger which exists in allowing persons of this class to carry out inoculations under all and any circumstances. The difficulty in supplying Veterinary Assistants is only a temporary one and will be got rid of when more graduates leave the colleges, and the prospects offered them improve in comparison with those afforded by other Departments. As no action appears to be taken by local authorities to relieve the suffer- ings of Ticca Gharry and Ekka ponies, proposals will be put up with a view to extending the Hackney Carriage Act to this province, and also to making it compulsory to obtain a license for all ekka ponies. It appears to be desirable also that efforts should be made to establish some sort of control over the goalas and their methods of supplying milk. D. QUINLAN, M. R. C. V.

No. 440A., dated Ranchi, the 28th2 It is thus apparent that the persons recruited are of the class from which the ordinary ministerial officers in Government service are drawn. The same caste in about the same proportion would be found in any Government office in Bihar, whereas if the men selected for veterinary training were properly selected with a view to the profession they are to embrace, one would expect to find a preponderating element of the classes closely connected with agriculture; for example, Rajputs, Bhuihar Brahmans, Goalas, Koiris, Kurmis, Khandaits from Orissa and Mundas and Oraons from Chota Nagpur with a few Muhammadans of the cultivating class. The error that at present exists originates from the fact that we are content to take men who have practically all failed to pass the Matriculation Examination and who consequently find the usual, and undoubt- edly to them preferable, career of service in an office closed to them. We also insist on an education in English by requiring them to be taught in a langu- age in which they are evidently not fully instructed, with the results indicated by Mr. Quinlan. The whole question of the pay and travelling allowance of officials of the Department has for some time been engaging the attention of the Superintendent as well as the question of the future educational policy to be adopted and proposals will shortly be made to Government for considera- tion. My own opinion is that the vital necessity for the success of the Depart- ment is not so much the improvement of the pay and prospects of the service as a radical change in the methods of training and the recruitment of a class of officer having a more intimate connection with the life of the peasan- try and a greater natural inclination for the profession he has adopted. I make these remarks without desiring to disparage much the greatest proportion of the officers now in service, yet that these strictures are justified is shown by the. fact that within the year no less than 5 officers either were dismissed or resign- ed as a result of the institution of enquiries regarding their behaviour. This is a heavy loss from a department the sanctioned strength of which numbers 61 in all. 4. A distinct improvement has taken place in the reporting of cattle dis- ease. The procedure now followed is that the Sub-Inspector in charge of a thana prepares from Chaukidars' and Dafadars' statements and from his own knowledge of conditions in his charge, a brief statement in triplicate using car- bon paper. One copy goes to the Superintendent of Police and is forwarded by him to the Magistrate, the other despatched direct to the Veterinary Assistant concerned, who thus obtains prompt information of what is going on. Mr. Quinlan has taken much pains to interest the district officials in this matter, but much remains yet to be done to secure even an approximate estimate of cattle mortality. I refer particularly to his remarks under the sub-heading Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia, a disease which is responsible for great loss to the cultivator. The new register referred to at the close of the paragraph on the treat- ment of diseases is intended to be taken by the Veterinary Assistant to the mufassal; in it he will enter any information he may collect while on tour and will compare it with the records maintained at the thana. The enquiry regarding cattle disease in Ranchi which was made at the instance of the Revd. Father Hoffmann is likely to produce important results in the training of locally recruited youths as inoculators to combat the disease of Hæmor- rhagic Septicæmia. Since the close of the year under review a class of 28 youths has been formed and they are now going through a two months' course of instruction under the supervision of the chief Inspector of the Department, Babu P. N. Das. They promise well and great hopes are enter- tained that through their agency an important advance in prophylactics will be made. 5. The figures for preventive inoculations for the last three years are :3 The results are an improvement on those of the previous year but show only a small advance on those of 1910-11. It is expected that the succeeding year will disclose really notable progress if the experiment above referred to proves the success wo anticipate. 6. The question of increasing the number of touring officers is not one that should be raised at present, as we are unable to recruit men for the existing cadre and I am strongly opposed to the recruitment of outsiders. The matter is one that will meet with the consideration it certainly deserves when the policy regarding education is settled and a steady flow of recruits of a suitable class has been secured. 7. The fall of about 24 per cent. in the number of cases treated is rather surprising, but the Superintendent's explanations may be accepted. 8. It may appear somewhat surprising that no more than 5 requisitions for breeding bulls should have been received during the year, but it should be remembered that it is by this time well known that the Superintendent of the Civil Veterinary Department is not in a position to supply breeding bulls and that applications made to him have almost invariably been infructuous. It used to be the practice for the Superintendent to arrange for the capture of Brahmini bulls in consultation with officers or planters in neighbourhoods where they were so numerous as to be a burden on the people. A few such areas do exist, but the class of animal to be found is usually very inferior and indeed the raiyats will not in any case knowingly consent to the removal of a good animal from their village. It was further recognised that the haphazard transfer of inferior animals at rare intervals from one district to another could have no appreciably beneficial effect in improving the breed of cattle. The practice was therefore abandoned and since then the Depart- ment have not been in a position to supply full grown bulls. The most that could be done was to arrange for the purchase of a yearling calf, and this was hazardous for the reputation of the officers in charge since, at that age, it is not possible to be certain how the animal will develop. Most requests for bulls have therefore been met with the reply that the Department was not in a position to assist. A healthy demand for breeding animals is expected to spring up upon the constitution of a bull-breeding and bull-rearing farm in Worth Bihar4 the stress of agricultural operations has slackened after the transplantation of the winter rice, while all cattle are concentrated in the villages owing to the flooded condition of the swamps and river hanks on which they graze in the cold weather. 8. There is some confusion apparent in the table recording the number of horses and ponies present at Sonepur. Presumably the total figure of all stock present has been confused with the sum total of the horses and ponies. I may add that these figures are mere estimates, as there is no agency for securing an exact or even an approximate enumeration. The figures for the Sitamarhi Fair for April 1912 should have been reported. It is one of the most important cattle fairs in the province. I strongly support the criticism passed by the Superintendent on the Bengal and North-Western Railway administration at Sonepur. The failure to handle the cattle offered for transport during the mela amounted to a scandal. I observed several thousands of cattle waiting day after day in the Railway yard, becom- ing daily thinner for want of adequate food and exercise, while no particular effort was apparent on the part of the Railway authorities to clear the block that had been allowed to accumulate. The Railway is notoriously indifferent to the public convenience and I consider that this phase of its failure to meet the reasonable demands made upon its resources should be brought prominently to its notice by Government. As a matter of fact, the Company lost revenue to a considerable extent as many animals were removed by road and river after waiting in vain for transport by rail. 9. I concur in the estimate framed by the Superintendent of the merits of his principal officers and particularly of the Chief Inspector, Babu P. N. Das. Mr. Quinlan himself is an energetic and able officer who has done his best to make the Department an influence and success, although hampered by in- adequate and, as I have indicated, in some cases unsuitable staff. The question of a second Imperial Officer for his assistance will shortly be submitted to Government.
GOVERNMENT OF BIHAR AND ORISSA. REVENUE DEPARTMENT. AGRICULTURE. Ranchi, the 27th September 1913. RESOLUTION No. 6611R. READ2 7. No new dispensary was opened during the year. In all 25,159 animals were treated in the 22 dispensaries under the supervision of the Superintendent, showing a decrease of 1,552 as compared with the number treated during the previous year. The Lieutenant-Governor in Council regrets that there are as yet no signs of an increased appreciation of the usefulness of these institu- tions on the part of the general public. 8. The cattle breeding farm maintained by the Bettiah estate is at present the only institution of its kind in Bihar and Orissa and its operations are on a small scale only. The question of improving the general breed of cattle in the province is now engaging the attention of Government. Mr. G. Milne, who is at present officiating as Director of Agriculture, was placed on special duty for six months during the year to make a preliminary enquiry into the cattle question, and a rough census of cattle is about to be undertaken through the agency of the village panchayats. Mr. Milne's report, which is expected shortly, will enable Government to review the situation. Meanwhile arrangements are in progress to start a Government cattle-breeding farm in North Bihar which, if successful, will be the first serious attempt to arrest the deterioration of agricultural stock throughout the province. 9. Five Inspectors and 61 Veterinary Assistants were under the control of the Superintendent during the year. The majority of these officers are reported to have worked well, but the proportion of failures, which is due chiefly to the causes noticed in paragraph 3 above, is unduly high. 10. Mr. Quinlan displayed much personal energy in the supervision of the subordinate staff of the Department. Government recognise that his task in coping with the Veterinary needs of the province with the materials at his disposal is difficult and they hope that he will continue his efforts to enlist the co-operation and sympathy of District Officers and the general public.

DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, BIHAR AND ORISSA. FROM G. MILNE, ESQ., I.C.S., OFFG. DIRECTOR OF AGRICULTURE, BIHAR AND ORISSA, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BIHAR AND ORISSA, REVENUE DEPARTMENT. Dated Ranchi, the 13th July 1914. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit the Annual Report on the Civil Veterinary Department of this Province for the year ending 31st March 1914. Mr. Quinlan held charge throughout the year. The question of transferring his headquarters from Bhagalpur where they are located at present to Ranchi was considered, but it has been dropped for the present owing to the inability of the Public Works Department to provide accommodation. Mr. Quinlan was on tour for 299 days and during that time travelled 12,862 miles by rail and 2,413 miles by road. During his tours he inspected hospitals and dispensaries and the work of Itinerant Veterinary Assistants and also attended outbreaks of Rinderpest in the Ranchi and the Gaya districts during the months of Octo- ber and January. He also visited the Cattle Farms at Bettiah and Siripur and advised regarding a cattle-station at Sipaya. Mr. Pool, a Supernumerary Officer of the Imperial Veterinary Service under training, joined in January and relieved Mr. Quinlan when he went on leave in April. 2. The area of the Superintendent's charge is too large for one Officer to deal adequately with its veterinary needs and to supervise properly the work of the subordinate staff. Proposals for increasing the Imperial staff of the department so as to provide one Superintendent for each of the three distinct tracts, Bihar, Orissa, and Chota Nagpur have been placed before Government. 3. The policy regarding veterinary education in the Province is now under the consideration of Government. Admissions from this Province into the Bengal Veterinary College are still very few though they show a slight advance over those of the previous year and the question of obtaining a sufficient number of suitable Veterinary graduates to fill the sanctioned cadre of the Department presents as much difficulty as ever. At the close of the session there were 23 students from this Province on the roll of the College, viz., 11 in class A, 7 in class B and 5 in class C, against 17 of the previous year. Of the 23 students, 14 are Biharis, 6 Oriyas and 3 Chota Nagpuris. Government sanctioned four stipends of Rs. 15 each a month for the Chota Nagpur Division, three of which were awarded to the students from Chota Nagpur and one to an Oriya, no Chota Nagpuri having been found available. The boys from Chota Nagpur failed at the examination in March but they have been recommended for another year's trial. Regarding other divisions Mr. Quinlan was asked to address the District Boards, which are now in a much stronger financial position, on the question of granting stipends where none are offered at present and of enhancing them where those offered are inadequate. This has been done and the result is awaited. The needs of the Chota Nagpur Division, where the District Boards are poor and the people are particularly backward, are still under consideration, During the year under
2 report the Government of the United Provinces proposed to the local Govern- ment that Bihar and Orissa should join with the Western Province in founding a new College to be situated at Allahabad or Cawnpur. This proposal has been accepted by the local Government and it is intended that a minimum of six candidates shall be sent yearly from Bihar and Orissa from the Hindi-speaking tracts of the Province. Oriya and Bengali students would continue to be trained as before at the Bengal Veterinary College at Belgachia. It is under- stood that instruction at the new College will be imparted in the vernacular and this will, so far as Bihar proper and Chota Nagpur are concerned, open the way for the recruitment of students from the ranks of agriculturists rather than from the classes from which clerical or ministerial officers are obtained. In the resolution on last year's report Government indicated that much importance was attached to the development of the Department in this direc- tion and it is hoped that the United Provinces' scheme will be carried into effect at an early date. At present, although District Boards show a commend- able desire to increase expenditure on veterinary aid the Department is unable to supply the number of qualified veterinary assistants that are demanded. A further regrettable feature of the present dearth of candidates is the fact that Biharis and Oriyas, to say nothing of the natives of the Chota Nagpur districts, are being passed over through the recruitment of men from outside provinces, Bengal, the Punjab and Madras. This in the circumstances has proved unavoidable, but is to be deprecated since it is unlikely that we can obtain graduates of the first quality for service outside their own provinces. It is hoped that on the opening of a College in the United Provinces with a course of instruction in the vernacular candidates will be sent forward in suffi- cient numbers to prevent the department being swamped by outsiders. 4. Considerable improvement has taken place in the reporting of cattle disease. Veterinary Inspectors and Assistants visited the thanas and checked in the villages the figures recorded in the thana registers. It is gratifying to be able to report that the district officers and Superintendents of Police have taken much interest in the matter and given valuable help from time to time. The missionaries in Chota Nagpur have also largely assisted in supplying more accurate figures for the area under their charge and the thanks of Government are due to them for their help. The new Registers have simplified the keeping of these statistics. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia and Rinderpest have been very prevalent especially in Chota Nagpur, where they caused a large mortality. 5. The experiment initiated last year to combat Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia in the Chota Nagpur Division through the agency of locally-trained inoculators was carried out during the year with the co-operation of the missionaries. The degree of success obtained and the policy to be adopted for the future conduct of the scheme will form the subject of a special report to Government. 6. The number of deaths from contagious diseases amongst bovines rose considerably from 7,591 of the previous year to 18,227, rinderpest alone being responsible for more than half the number. The increase, though mainly attributable to the prevalence of the diseases, Rinderpest and Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia, in Chota Nagpur, is to some extent due to better reporting. Out of 1,525 outbreaks of rinderpest no more than 369 could be attended for want of an adequate staff. These figures emphasise the necessity for taking such steps as will popularise the veterinary service and create a flow of aspirants for the veterinary qualification. 7. The total number of inoculations performed during the year (excluding the figures for Ranchi) rose to 53,109 against 22,124 in 1912-13. With the Ranchi figures added 121,020 cattle were inoculated during the year which is an extremely satisfactory record of progress. A greater advance might have been recorded but for the break-down in the supply of serum from the Mukteswar laboratory during the period from July 1913 to March 1914. It is gratify- ing to observe that the percentage of deaths subsequent to inoculation is remarkably low. Itinerant Veterinary Assistants visited 11,548 villages against 11,508 villages visited the year previous. Mr. Quinlan and his subordinates have done much to combat the prejudice which still exists among the people against inoculation. The meeting with the Pundits at Puri referred to in last
3 year's report was duly held, when an opinion favourable to the practice of inoculation on cattle was formally recorded. This opinion, together with the deliverance of the Pundits of Darbhanga, has since been translated into the principal languages of the province and widely circulated in the form of a pamphlet, and it is hoped that in course of time all prejudice against inoculation will disappear. My own opinion is that this will certainly be the case where measures can be promptly and systematically taken to stamp out an epidemic. 8. No new dispensary was opened during the year. The number of, in and out-patients treated in the 22 dispensaries under the supervision of the Superintendent was 23,849 against 25,159 in 1912-13. The decrease is attri- buted to the closing of the Hathwa Raj dispensary and to the employment of the assistant in charge of the Palamau Dispensary for combating outbreaks in the interior. It is likely that the Dumraon Dispensary will be closed for financial reasons. 9. A cattle-breeding farm has now been started at Sipaya with 15 cows 29 heifers, 14 of which are already in calf, 11 calves and 1 bull presented by the Maharani of Hathwa. This is part of the stock of the Siripur cattle farm of the Hathwa Raj which has been closed for breeding, and the acknowledgments of Government are due to the Maharani Saheba for the generous gift. These animals have a pedigree and, apart from the Bettiah herd, are the only local cattle in Bihar of which that can be said, so that the new farm starts with a nucleus of satisfactory breeding stock. It is hoped that it will be in full working order in the course of the next two years when the buildings are com- pleted and the farm is equipped with a full complement of breeding animals. No breeding animals have yet been purchased by Government for the farm. The cattle-breeding farm maintained by the Bettiah Raj is in full work- ing order. Thirty-two bulls including 15 buffaloes were distributed during the year for breeding purposes and were placed in charge of the Managers of factories in Champaran district within the property of the Raj. Attention is invited to the Superintendent's remarks regarding the export of cattle from Bihar to Bengal and Assam during the year. It will be remembered that the Bihar Planters' Association, at their meeting in January 1914, also put on record their dismay at the growth of the export trade and at the rise in prices. The facts which are undoubted emphasize the necessity for safeguarding the cattle of the province and particularly of North Bihar from disease by the rapid increase of the subordinate staff and the provision of more supervising officers. The initiation of the cattle farm at Sipaya is a step in the right direction and will undoubtedly lead to an improvement in the class of draught animal bred, while it is also intended to endeavour to produce a typo of animal useful for both draught and dairy purposes. 10. A rough census of the cattle of the Province (except Hazaribagh, Ranchi, Palamau, and Manbhum) was carried out during the year through the agency of chaukidars and panchayats. The result was on the whole satisfactory and a special report has been submitted to Government. The report on the preliminary enquiry into the cattle question is also now ready and will shortly be submitted. 11. The subordinate staff under the control of the Superintendent during the year consisted of 5 Veterinary Inspectors, 2 Inspectors of Inoculation in Ranchi and 57 Veterinary Assistants. The majority of these officers are reported to have worked well. Proposals regarding their pay and travelling allowance are now before Government. The proposals allow for a small increase of pay both to Inspectors and to Veterinary Assistants of both classes and provide for raising the travelling allowance of Itinerant Veterinary Assistants to Rs. 25 per month subject to the proviso that Re. 1 less shall be allowed for every day less than twenty-five spent on tour. These proposals are in my opinion adequate to meet the rise in the cost of living that has taken place in recent years, and if we are successful in recruiting men from the agri- cultural classes who will undergo a training in the vernacular only and who will not be required to know English should prove an amply sufficient incen- tive to join the department. There will however always be a difficulty if Oriya- speaking candidates are to be trained in the English language at Belgachia,
4 since their preliminary educational qualification will require to be higher. I consider however that this difficulty is of comparatively small importance since the Oriya districts are unimportant as cattle-breeding tracts and are unlikely o be capable of much improvement. We require to concentrate our attention on North and South Bihar. The name of Babu P. N. Das, 1st Veterinary Inspector, is brought to the notice of Government. As in past years, this officer has distinguished himself by good work. Mr. Pool during the months from January to March fitted himself to take over charge of the Province by touring in company with the permanent Superintendent and independently. Mr. Quinlan as usual toured most energetically throughout his charge, but in the present conditions much of his time is unavoidably spent in long train journeys and, as has been pointed out before, the administration of the Department cannot be satisfactory until two more European supervising officers are provided. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient Servant, G. MILNE, Offg. Director of Agriculture, Bihar and Orissa.

PREFACE AND GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. During the year under report I held charge of the Civil Veterinary Department of this Province. The headquarters continue to remain at Bhagalpur which is very satisfac- tory owing to its proximity to most of the important districts; I hope this arrangement will be allowed to stand. Touring this year has been very continuous and I trust that in expressing my dissatisfaction with the system now in vogue, Government will be pleased to consider favourably the proposal sent up this year for increasing the number of Imperial officers. Altogether I have been away 299 days from headquarters and during that time travelled 12,862 miles by rail and 2,413 miles by road. Inspection of hospitals and dispensaries and the work of the Itinerating Veterinary Assistants formed the principal part of these duties, thoug I attended outbreaks of Rinderpest in Ranchi and Gaya districts in which I made extended tours during the months of October and January. I visited Bettiah Cattle Farm on three occasions, Sipaya Cattle Station three times and Siripur once. As in previous years, I was present at Sonepur Pair but was unable to attend either Khagra, Bihta or Barahpur. In December I went to Coimbatore to attend the Agricultural Conference and also took the opportunity on my return journey of going over the Madras Veteri- nary College and two District Dispensaries. I was present at the meeting of the Bihar Planters' Association at Muzaffarpur in January, and in March acted as an examiner at the Annual Examinations of the Bengal Veterinary College. I should like to refer to my remarks in last year's report on the necessity of providing another Imperial officer as the present system is inimical to the interests of the Department and of stock owners. Another officer is very urgently required. Mr. Pool of the Civil Veterinary Department, Punjab, a supernumerary officer under training, joined here in January with a view to relieving me when I go on leave this month (April). We toured together in the Patna Division and also visited the cattle farms at Bettiah, Sipaya, and Siripur, while Mr. Pool alone attended the cattle fairs at Barahpur and Bihta where he assisted in purchasing cattle for the Sabour and Sipaya Agricultural Farms. He also acted as an examiner at the Examin- ations of the Sabour Agricultural College.
2 PART I. VETERINARY INSTRUCTION. The question of obtaining a sufficient number of graduates from among whom suitable candidates could be selected to fill the posts now vacant in the Department is as acute as ever. Young men with the required attainments did not present themselves although local bodies and private individuals had their attention drawn to the subject as in previous years. Stipends were asked to be increased to Rs. 13 this year, but I am unable to say at present how many dis- tricts will acquiesce in this proposal. Government sanctioned four stipends of Rs. 15 each during the year under report ; three were awarded to students from the Ranchi Missions and one to an Oriya. The boys from Chota Nagpur failed at the examinations in March, but they have been recommended for another year's trial. The table set out below gives particulars regarding the students from this province that were on the roll of the Bengal Veterinary College during the year :3 EQUINES. It is satisfactory to have to state that no outbreaks of any of the scheduled contagious diseases occurred during the year. BOVINCE. Rinderpest.4 It is regrettable to have to state that opposition to inoculation still continues though more acquaintance with its advantages over other forms of treatment will, no doubt, overcome these prejudices as time goes on. The opinion of the Pandits of the Jaggarnath Temple and Darbhanga were translated into Hindi and Oriya, but only the Hindi version has so far been distributed, the pamphlets in Oriya not having been received from the Press. As pointed out previously, the small number of qualified Assistants has militated against the expansion of the Department, but every effort will be made to use the present staff to the best advantage in the suppression of the preventable mortality. The total number of inoculations done during the year amounts to 53,109 as compared with 22,124 in 1912-13. Rinderpest.5 dealing efficiently with the question of cattle disease in Chota Nagpur and a full report has since been submitted on the working on the scheme with sugges- tions as to how to do this effectively. Black-quarter.6 Stationary and Itinerant post on financial grounds, with the arrangement that the Assistant in charge should attend outbreaks when required, while he would draw the allowances of an Itinerant Veterinary Assistant. The old Bihar Veterinary Hospital at Muzaffarpur was purchased by the District Board and is now under reconstruction. A new hospital is urgently required at Ranchi as the District Board have to pay a considerable sum each month in house-rent for the present unsatis- factory and broken-down building. Others are under contemplation for Hajipur, Banka, Supaul, Motihari, Dhanbaid, and Bhadrak, and will be com- pleted during the coming year. The posts of the Stationary Veterinary Assist- ants for Hajipur, Supaul, and Motihari have already been sanctioned. The Dispensary at Hathwa was closed during the latter part of the year, the Assistant having joined the Department. No arrangements have been made for its reopening. It is also likely that the Dumraon Dispensary will be closed for financial reasons during the current year, the Veterinary Assistant having applied to he taken into Government service. The Veterinary Assistants in charge of the hospitals of Bankipur, Muzaf- farpur, Monghyr, Cuttack, Gaya, Ranchi, and Bhagalpur did well and take considerable interest in their work. The Shoeing Forges, with the exception of Monghyr continue to do good work and show a considerable profit ; in the case of Monghyr, however, the forge is run at a loss. Five forges were worked at an income of Rs. 3,119 against the expenditure of Rs. 2,562. The number of in and out-patients treated at the Hospitals and Dispensaries rose to 23,849. The decrease of 1,280 patients as compared with the previous year is mainly contributed by Palamau where the Veterinary Assistant could not treat more cases at headquarters as he had to spend most of his time in attending outbreaks in the interior. The closing of the Dispensary at Hathwa also helped. The District Board of Monghyr have provided their Sadr Assistant with quarters at a cost of Rs. 2,300. TABLE VIII. BREEDING OPERATIONS. No requisitions for bulls were received during the year. TABLE IX. BULL-REARING AND BREEDING FARMS. The only herd now in working order in the Province is that maintained by the Bettiah Estate. It consists of : 30 bulls, 35 cows, 37 hull-calves, 24 cow-calves and 17 buffalo-bulls, or a total of 143 animals. Thirty-two bulls including 15 buffaloes were distributed to the Managers of the following factories, etc, : (1) Turkaulia, (2) Ramgarhwa, (3) Parsa, (4) Pipra, (5) Lohiaria, (6) Mirpore, (7) Barah, (8) Naraipore, (9) Baikunthpur, (10) Bettiah Mission, (11) Babu Avdish Prasad, Sikarpur, (12) Malaya, (13) Kooriah, (14) Benipore, (15) Madhubani, (16) Lathi, (17) Lauria, (18) Lalsaraia, (19) Rajpur, (20) Pelaria, (21) Sikta, and (22) Matiaria. New registers were issued during the year and accounts connected with the farm were more or less scrutinized. It is hoped that the cost of keeping each animal will be reduced during the coining year as it now works out at the rate of Rs. 8-11-0 per animal per month. The additional grazing area has not yet been fenced.
7 SIPAYA. Government contemplate starting a cattle farm at Sipaya near Gopalganj and for this purpose an area was selected by the Director of Agriculture, Mr. Milne, last year. The Maharani of Hathwa has graciously handed oyer some of the Siripur cattle with which to start it. They include 1 hull, 15 cows, 20 heifers and 11 calves. The farm will be under the management of Mr. M. Mackenzie, late Manager of Siripur, with a Veterinary Assistant who will be placed in charge of the herd. Mr. Mackenzie takes the keenest interest in all Agricultural subjects and should for this reason be the means of making it a success. TABLES X, XI, and XII. HOUSE AND PONY STALLIONS. No horse or pony stallion was maintained during the year. TABLES XIII and XIV. These Tables give particulars of the principal fairs and shows held in the province. At Sonepur Fair five elephants were purchased, two for the Madras Police and three for the Government Agent, Godavari, at a total cost of Rs. 14,360. The other fairs of importance were Bettiah (Dasahra), Bihta, Barahpur, Khagra, Dharamganj, and Hardi, all of which were attended either by the Veterinary Assistants or the Circle Inspectors. Mr. Pool was present at the Bihta and Barahpur fairs. Temporary hospitals were opened by the local Veterinary Assistants for the treatment of sick animals and help was eagerly looked for. In connection with the fairs held in Tirhut a statement was asked for from the Traffic Manager of the Bengal and North-Western Railway regarding the number of cattle which were transported to Eastern Bengal and Assam during 1913-14. The figures are as follows: 4,004 wagons representing roughly 32,032 head of stock, taking eight cattle to the truck. If one adds to these figures another 15,000 for those that were taken by road, it will be seen that the drainage of plough and cart bullocks from the northern districts of the province during the year has been phenomenal. During my tenure I have never seen anything to equal the demand that has arisen. Bullocks of all kinds and of any age have been bought by Eastern Bengal and Assam dealers while the price as compared with eight years ago has risen quite 75 per cent. In parts of Tirhut, however, the planters reckon that it has gone up as much as 100 per cent. It therefore appears to be necessary that Government should meet this demand by providing high class stud bulls and distributing them in suitable breeding areas as early as possible. SUBORDINATE VETERINARY ESTABLISHMENT. The total strength of the Subordinate Veterinary Establishment is specified in Table VII. Up to June, 1913, there were four Inspectors on the roll after which the fifth post was temporarily filled by promoting one of the Senior Veterinary Assistants, Babu S. N. Chatterjee. This Inspector is for the present in charge of the Bhagalpur Division with his headquarters at Bhagalpur. At the commencement of the year the sanctioned staff consisted of 58 Veterinary Assistants exclusive of the three employed by the Raj Estates, Hathwa, Bettiah, and Dumraon. As the posts under the Palamau Encumbered Estates and Sambalpur District Council remained vacant, the total number actually employed was 56 only. To this were added the four new graduates that passed in March 1913, making the total number 60. But as one Veteri- nary Assistant resigned during the year the number was 59 at the end of March 1914. The Veterinary Assistant of the Hathwa Raj joined the depart- ment in September last.
8 The Veterinary Assistants, Babu D. C. Guha of Hathwa and Babu P. Panda of Bargarh (District Sambalpur), were appointed Inspectors of Inoculators at Gumla and Khunti respectively. These two officers now receive pay at the rate of Rs. 30 per mensem as Reserve Veterinary Assistants and a staff allowance of Rs. 30 per month in addition to travelling allowances under the Civil Service Regulations. There was no change in the jurisdiction of the Inspectors, their head- quarters being the same as before, viz., at Bhagalpur, Muzaffarpur, Gaya, and Cuttack. Chief Veterinary Inspector Babu P. N. Das, in addition to his ordinary duties, held special enquiries into the work of the Veterinary Assistants in Gaya and Cuttack Circles. The most important part of his work during the last year consisted, however, in giving instructions to the Inoculators in Ranchi. He performed this duty satisfactorily and received an honorarium of Rs. 100. He also visited the Sonepur, Khagra, Bihta, and Barahpur fairs and made an investigation into Piri or " Indian yellow " paint manufacture in Monghyr. Babu B. L. Sur of Muzaffarpur Circle did not undertake any special work except the despatch of Kumri horses to Muktesar. He attended the Sitamarhi, Sonepur, Bettiah, and Hardi fairs. The other three Inspectors, Sirdar Sucha Singh, Babu D. N. Sirkar and Babu S. N. Chatterjee, were mostly engaged in attending outbreaks in their respective circles, and enquiring into the work of the Veterinary Assistants concerned. With the exception of Babu D. N. Sirkar, the work of all the Inspectors was satisfactory. The two Inspectors of Inoculators, Babus D. C. Guha and P. Panda per- formed their duties satisfactorily. Most of the districts that were in urgent need of Veterinary Assistants have applied to Government for sanction of new posts. RESEARCH WORK. Slides were sent to the Raymond Research Laboratory as usual. In Octo- ber last at the request of the Imperial Bacteriologist, four horses and one goat suffering from Kumri were despatched to Muktesar for experiment. GENERAL REMARKS. The pay as well as the allowances, which Veterinary Assistants now get, are not sufficient to attract good men, but it is hoped that the scheme sent up this year will meet with approval and be sanctioned at an early date. The rules and a small Manual of instructions have not yet been sanctioned, but it is hoped they will be ready for issue early in the coming year. During January last, sanction was accorded by Government to the count- ing towards increment of pay by Veterinary Assistants of their past services under the Local Bodies. This order has removed a long-felt grievance. There has been a considerable increase in the work of the office owing to the Ranchi Inoculation Scheme, to the increase in the amount of sera and vaccine handled and also to the realisation of the cost of Anti-Rinderpest serum. Altogether 6,037 letters were received and 4,318 issued during the year as against 4,714 and 3,355 of the previous year. Proposals for increasing the pay of the office staff have been submitted for sanction. D. QUINLAN, M.R.C.V.S., Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bihar and Orissa.

G. P. (Agri.) No. 40-360No. 7360/IA-154 R. GOVERNMENT OF BIHAR AND ORISSA, REVENUE DEPARTMENT. RESOLUTION Dated Ranchi, the 21st September 1914. READ2 operation during the year. The brief experience hitherto gained appears to indicate that the scheme was not initiated on perfectly sound line3 and will need reconstitution in detail. Meanwhile the final report promised by the Director is awaited. 5. The great advance in the number of preventive inoculations performed during the year and the increase in the percentage of resulting immunity augur well for the future. The unfortunate break in the supply of serum from Mukteswar prevented the Department from obtaining even better results than those shown. A large proportion of the inoculations performed were car- ried out by the new experimental agency in the Ranchi District. 6. No new dispensary was opened during the year and the work of existing institutions calls for no comment. 7. The first serious attempt to deal with the highly important question of cattle breeding has now been made with the establishment of a farm for this purpose at Sipaya in North Bihar under the direct control of the Local Government. The abnormal rise in the price of cattle, which has been remark- ed in recent years, and the deterioration of stock indicated the necessity for undertaking a measure of this kind with the least possible delay. A gift of over 50 head of valuable pedigree cattle, which was made by the Maharani of Hatwa, supplied the nucleus of a herd which is now maintained under the con- trol of Mr. M. Mackenzie, the Superintendent of Sipaya. The cordial thanks of His Honour in Council are due to the Maharani Sahiba for her generous gift. The detailed scheme for the equipment and management of the farm is awaited from the Director of Agriculture and will be submitted to the Government of India in the course of the next few months. 8. An experimental census of the agricultural stock of the province was taken last year through the agency of village chaukidars and Panchayats. The results, which have lately been reviewed by Government, are satisfactory and future operations of this nature, which have formed the subject of recent cor- respondence with the Government of India, will be conducted at suitable intervals on similar lines. His Honour in Council still awaits the preliminary enquiry into the question of a cattle survey which was made by Mr. Milne. 9. Five Veterinary Inspectors, two special Inspectors of Inoculation in Ranchi, and 57 Veterinary Assistants worked under the control of the Superin- tendent during the year. Reports on their work are generally good. Special commendation has been made in the Director's letter of the work of Babu P. N. Das, the first Veterinary Inspector. 10. Mr. Quinlan continued to discharge his duties with the most commend- able energy. The unwieldiness of his charge is a constant impediment to a satis- factory outturn of work and handicaps most seriously all efforts to control a campaign against epidemic diseases. The Lieutenant-Governor in Council trusts that it will be possible in the near future to give him such assistance as will enable supervision to be more closely carried out.

MILNE, ESQ., I.C.S., DIRECTOR OF AGRICULTURE, BIHAR AND ORISSA, TO THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BIHAR AND ORISSA, REVENUE DEPARTMENT. Dated Ranchi, the 30th July 1915. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit the Annual Report of the Civil Vete- rinary Department of this Province for the year ending 31st March 1915. Mr. Pool held charge of the Department during the absence on leave of Mr. Quin- lan from the 9th of April 1914 to the 13th of September 1914. For the rest of the year it was administered by Mr. Quinlan and Mr. Pool continued to act as a supernumerary officer till the 27th October 1914, when he was trans- ferred to Madras as officiating Principal of the Madras Veterinary College. Altogether he spent 163 days in the districts while Mr. Quinlan was on tour for 166 days. The most important investigation on which he was engaged during the year was that connected with the serious outbreak of rinderpest in Champaran, a special report on which has been separately submitted to Government. 2. With regard to recruitment of veterinary students for training at Belgachia, I have nothing to add to remarks made in the two preceding years. Most District Boards have now increased the value of stipends offered to Rs. 13 per month, four District Boards have sanctioned additional stipends and two who offered no stipend before have now agreed to do so. Nevertheless, there was no great response to the Superintendent's call for students for admission to Belgachia. Mr. Quinlan attributes this to the low scale of pay and want of prospects in the Veterinary Department. There were at the beginning of the session 29 students from this Province against 28 of the last year in the Bengal Veterinary College, 11 being sent up by District Boards. The results of the annual examination were, however, satisfactory. Six students appeared at the final examination and five passed, of whom one, a boy from Sambalpur, headed the list. In the first year class 13 sat for the examination of whom 9 including the four Government stipendiaries passed and the first place was again secured by a boy from Sambalpur. The fifth Government stipendiary was promoted to the second year class. I visited the College once during the year and saw the boys belonging to the Province. Only a certain percentage of them appeared to belong to the agricultural classes and to be likely prima- facie to become good veterinary assistants. 3. The widespread and virulent outbreak of rinderpest in the Champaran district disclosed deplorable slackness on the part of the chowkidars and thana officers in reporting cattle-disease. The local Veterinary Assistants and the Inspector, B. L. Sur, can also not be acquitted of apathy or of ignorance of what was happening in their jurisdictions. An earlier knowledge of the extent of the outbreak would have prevented much regrettable loss to the cultivators. The Superintendent also mentions Purnea, Darbhanga and Saran as districts where the Police have not yet realised the importance of promptly reporting
2 the existence of cattle disease. Elsewhere there is said to he a marked im- provement in reporting which is due to the constant inspections made by the Superintendent and to the help rendered by District Officers and Superintend- ents of Police. Until recently the Police Manual laid down that only Veterin- ary Inspectors might examine the register of epidemics and cattle diseases maintained at the thanas, but the Inspector-General of Police has at my instance issued a circular directing that Veterinary Assistants also may inspect these registers. 4. The number of deaths from contagious diseases amongst bovines rose from 18,227 of last year to 28,365, rinderpest alone being responsible for 23,085. Mr. Quinlan thinks that this is an under-estimate and that 35,000 would be nearer the mark. There were 3,882 outbreaks of rinderpest against 1,525 of the previous year, but the number attended, viz., 60 per cent. shows a considerable improvement over that of last year, viz., 24 per cent. only. In addition to Champaran other districts which suffered from this disease were Hazaribagh, Ranchi, Palamau, Monghyr, Angul, Manbhum, Cuttack, Bhagal- pur and Puri. As is shown by the percentage of outbreaks attended and the number of inoculations effected, vigorous efforts were made to deal with these epidemics. Mr. Quinlan was however greatly handicapped by the paucity of his staff, the absence of reserve and staff veterinary assistants and again lays stress on the importance of increasing the strength of both the superior and subordinate establishment. It is hoped, that the scheme for the improvement of the position of the veterinary service which was submitted to Government last year will conduce to the better working of the Department. Nothing, however, will be effectual which does not induce a steady flow of candidates of the agricultural classes to centres of veterinary education whether in Calcutta or in the United Provinces. At the present rate of progress it will take a number of years before the Veterinary Department is adequate to the task before it. 5. The total number of inoculations performed during the year rose to 130,027 against 121,020 of the previous year. It should be remembered that for the three years 1910-11 to 1912-13 the average number of inocu- lations effected was no more than 19,000 per annum, so that the magnitude of the extension of preventive inoculation should be realised and all credit given to the Superintendent and his staff. Of these inoculations the Veterinary staff proper were responsible for 85,688 while the aboriginal staff in Ranchi have 41,339 to their credit. The former figure represents an increase of 32,579 on the previous year's work. The latter shows a decrease of 26,795 which is reported to be due to resignations and dismissals among the staff as well as to opposition met with in certain villages in the Munda country. Steps are being taken to train new men while the assistance of the local Officers has been invoked, and it is hoped that next year will show better results. Inoculation for rinderpest was introduced during the latter part of the year, but only 3,223 operations were performed. The missionaries have continued to render material assistance, but there is no doubt that to make the scheme a genuine success more supervision by the Superintendent, Civil Veterin- ary Department, is required and this is hardly possible while he has to strugge single-handed with epidemics throughout the whole province. 6. The number of hospitals working fell from 22 to 20 during the year, as the Veterinary Assistants employed by the Dumraon and Hathwa estates were absorbed into Government service and these posts have not been filled up The number of in-patients and out-patients treated at the 20 dispensaries was 28,044 against 23,849 of the previous year. The Bettiah Raj dispensary has been enlarged during the year and is now one of the best dispensaries in the Province. The question of building a new hospital for Ranchi is under the consideration of the District Board and a number of other schemes for hospitals or quarters are coming satisfactorily to a head. Local bodies now 6how no reluctance to sanction expenditure on veterinary aid and only the difficulty of providing staff hinders a rapid development. 7. The Government Cattle-breeding farm at Sepaya is making satisfactory progress ; a full account of Mr. Mackenzie's work will be given in the report of the Agricultural Department.
3 8. The Bettiah Raj farm continued to be managed under the general super vision of the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department. At the end of the year the herd consisted of 37 cows, 11 bull calves above two years of age, 14 bull calves of two years of age, three of one year, six under twelve months and two 6tud bulls. Twenty-six bulls and 17 buffalo bulls have been distributed in the districts of Champaran, Muzaffarpur and Darbhanga. Thirty-two calvea were born during the year out of which 21 were heifers and 11 were bull calves. An outbreak of anthrax confirmed by microscopic examination occurred in the herd and three calves died. 9. A scheme to improve the breeding operations in the Province in co-oper- ation with District Boards and the Registrar of Co-operative Credit Societies was considered during the year. The principle to be followed is that the District Boards should purchase breeding bulls from the Government cattle- breeding farm and distribute them to Co-operative Societies, who would look after the animals and undertake to feed them to the satisfaction of the Boards. In pursuance of this scheme three bulls were purchased by the District Board of Gaya for distribution to Societies. The District Board of Purnea has also taken one bull. The Sabour Dairy Farm has supplied a Montgomery bull to the Gaya Co-operative Milk Society and another to the Ranchi Municipality, while four good Montgomery cows and an bull have been procured for the Ranchi Agricultural Station. 10. The Subordinate Staff under the control of the Superintendent during the year consisted of five Veterinary Inspectors, two Inspectors of inoculation in Ranchi and 64 Veterinary Assistants. The majority of these officers are reported to have worked well. Two additional posts of Inspectors, one on Rs. 130 and another of Rs. 70 were sanctioned with effect from April 1915. 11. I regret to learn that the 1st Inspector, Babu P. N. Das is likely to be incapacitated for further work. This officer has uniformly rendered good ser- vice. Mr. Quinlan as usual was indefatigable in touring and administered the Department with great energy. I have the honour to be, SIR. Your most obedient Scrvant, G. MILNE, Director of Agriculture, Bihar and Orissa, B. & O. G. P. (Agri.) No. 36-350 + 2ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT BIHAR AND ORISSA FOR THE YEAR 1915-16. PREFACE AND GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. THE Civil Veterinary Department, during the year now under review, was in charge of Mr. Pool, of the Punjab Veterinary College, from the 9th of April 1914 to the 13th of September 1914, as I had been granted leave. For the remainder of the year it was administered by me. From the date of his handing over, till the 27th October 1914 when he was transferred to Madras as Officiating Principal of the Veterinary College, he continued to act as a Supernumerary Officer. He carried out the usual routine duties of inspecting Dispensaries and Hospitals, and, in addition toured in the Ranchi District and visited Pokhuria in Manbhum District in connection with the working of the Inoculation scheme, and submitted a report to Government. Altogether he spent 163 days in the Districts, and travelled 6,706 miles by rail and 678 miles by road. As in previous years, most of my work consisted in the inspection of Hospitals and Dispensaries. I visited the cattle farm at Bettiah, but the Government Cattle Farm at Sepaya was not inspected as it is under the Agricultural Department, with a special Officer to look after it. In October and November, enquiries were made into the prevalence of Rinderpest in Champaran, and a report was submitted to Government. A further reference to this outbreak will be found in another section of this report. I visited Sonepur, Khagra and Singeswarthan fairs, to purchase elephants for the Government of Madras, and for the Deputy Commissioner of Bilaspur, and attended as an examiner, at the Annual Examinations of the Bengal Veterinary College, and of the Agricultural College, Sabour. Since my return from leave, touring has been continuous. The work of the Department has been very heavy this year, on account of the widespread outbreak of Rinderpest, and the absence of the two senior Inspectors. Babu P. N. Das and Babu B. L. Sur on sick leave, and of my inability to provide substitutes to act for them. During the period under report I spent 166 days on tour and travelled 7,213 miles by rail and 1,716 miles by road. PART I. VETERINARY INSTRUCTION. I regret to have again to repeat the remarks made by me in last year's report regarding the very few Bihari and Oriya students who think it worth their while to apply for stipends to enable them to carry on their studies at the Bengal Veterinary College. Although the scholarships granted by District Boards
2 have now been increased to Rs. 13 a month, there appears to be no doubt that the real cause of our inability to obtain candidates. is the low scale of pay, and the lack of prospects which are open to those who enter this branch of Government service. This opinion has been confirmed by most District Officers. A scheme for the re-organisation of the Department was submitted to Government before I proceeded on leave, and it is understood that the local Government after carefully considering it and consulting the local bodies con- cerned are about to lay it before the Government of India. This year, 11 boys, exclusive of the 4 Government stipendiaries, were sent up by District Boards for training at Belgachia. It is satisfactory to be able to state that the three Government stipend-holders from Ranchi district passed their Annual Examination successfully, and are likely to become useful Assist- ants. An additional stipend was sanctioned for an Oriya student who also passed with credit. The number of students from this province at the Bengal Veterinary College at the end of the session was 13 in the 1st year, 7 in the 2nd year and 6 in the third year class of whom 9, 5 and 5, respectively passed at the annual examination. The new graduates who passed their examinations at the end of March 1915 will be admitted to the Department at the beginning of the next year. PART II. TREATMENT OF DISEASE. As in 1913-14 special attention has been given to the reporting of disease by the Police, and marked improvement has been noticed in all districts, except Purnea, Darbhanga and Saran, where the Police have not yet realised the importance of this part of their duties. In Champaran, the Chaukidars failed to report Rinderpest and as a result there was a widespread and very virulent outbreak. Itinerating Assistants and Inspectors, as an important part of their duties, visit thanas as often as possible, and in this way keep the Epidemic Report Register up-to-date. District Officers and Superintendents of Police have helped ungrudgingly, and to them special thanks are due for the manner in which they have pushed forward inoculations and in other ways helped the Department. The total number of outbreaks of all diseases reported during the year was 3,882 against 1,525 of 1913-14. Two thousand two hundred and ninety- two were attended. The establishment of closer relations with the Co-operative Credit Societies is a subject of the greatest importance, and is engaging my attention, but the want of sufficient Assistants makes it impossible for the Department to extend its activities in this direction as energetically as the subject demands. EQUINES. No outbreaks of the scheduled contagious diseases of equines were reported during the year, but there were three outbreaks of Anthrax in which five animals died. Necessary steps were taken to control them. I am unable to state what caused 13 deaths under the head "other Contagious Diseases". BOVINES. Rinderpest.3 time, and when it was brought to notice, the steps taken were insufficient for its suppression, with the result that a great number of villages became affected and hundreds of cattle died. In October, an investigation of an out- break of Anthrax at Pursa Factory, Champaran, by Mr. Pool, led to its discovery in that part of the district. An enquiry was started, and it was then disclosed that it had been in existence for about nine months, and had caused considerable mortality in all parts of the Bettiah Sub-division. Active steps were immediately taken to deal with it, by drafting in Assistants from other districts, while the first Inspector, Babu. P. N. Das was placed in charge of the operations. It is satisfactory to note that in spite of severe opposition, a large number of inoculations were successfully performed, and that the disease at the end of the year was well in hand. The number of deaths from Rinderpest in Champaran as given in Table II, have been compiled from figures collected by the Inspectors, the Veterinary Assistants, and the Police ; but these do not represent, in my opinion, the total mortality by nearly one-half, as during the enquiry which I made, there was hardly a villager questioned, who did not complain of his losses. Some who took cattle to the grazing grounds returned without any. The disease was particularly severe on buffaloes. I therefore think that the deaths were at least 10,000. Taking Rs. 40 as the average price of each animal that died, cattle owners in Champaran, and especially in Bettiah Sub-division, must have lost Rs. 4,00 000 worth of stock from this disease alone, during the short time it was prevalent. The other districts which have shown a high death rate are Hazaribagh, Ranchi, Palamau, Gaya, Monghyr, Angul, Manbhum, Cuttack, Bhagalpur and Puri ; but in these districts the number of deaths appear to me to have been underestimated also. In Banki Sub-division of Cuttack District, the deaths were supposed to have been about 3,000 according to the Deputy Registrar of Co-operative Credit Societies. Therefore, although the total number of deaths for the whole province is given as 23,085 it appears to me that 35,000 would be nearer the correct figure. Taking this number as the actual, and Rs. 30 as the average price of each animal, the total loss to cultivators during the year in Bihar and Orissa falls not far short in my opinion of Rs. 10,50,000 from Binderpest alone. Foot and Mouth Disease.4 this method of preventive treatment, I regret to have to state that although disease was particularly virulent in Champaran, Monghyr, South Bhagalpur, Sambalpur, Cuttack, and part of the Puri District, it was very difficult to get any inoculations done, owing to the intense religious prejudices of the people of these parts. In Jamui Sub-division, for example, even the personal efforts of the District Magistrate and of the Sub-Divisional Officer showed unpro- ductive results, and practically no inoculations could be done. The success of the " Serum Alone " method of treatment, as pointed out last year, is undoubted, provided that doses suitable to the District in which it is employed are used. For instance, in Bettiah Sub-division, the normal dose was injected at first, but it very soon became apparent that animals which did not receive double or treble doses or more were not immunized. There has been no lack of Serum or other products of the Imperial Bacteriological Laboratory, Muktesar, this year, and in part to this fact must be attributed the large number of animals which have been immunized. Altogether 130,027 cattle were protected, as compared with 121,020 of 1913-14, showing an increase of about 9,000. If the number inoculated by the Ranchi Inoculators is not taken into account, it will be seen that the staff of the Department have performed 85,688 inoculations or 32,579 more than in 1913-14. Although the number of inoculations carried out by the Veterinary Staff of the Department has increased considerably over those of the previous year, many more could have been done if a Staff of Reserve and Staff Veter- inary Assistants had been available ; 20 extra Assistants could have been given employment, had they been procurable. Rinderpest.5 A Conference composed of the Director of Agriculture, the Deputy Com- missioner of Ranchi and myself was held in Ranchi to discuss questions connected with the scheme. Certain suggestions for its better administration were approved, and have since been carried out. During the year under report 75,280 doses of Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia Vaccine and 15,000 doses of Anti-rinderpest Serum were received at the Depôt in Ranchi from Muktesar, of which 74,780 and 13,300 doses respectively were supplied to the Missionaries, etc., up to the end of the year. Table XIV (B) shows cost of the establishment. As regards the Sera and Vaccines used by the Department, 146,000 doses of Anti-rinderpest Serum representing a value of Rs. 13,075 ; 16,000 doses of H. S. Vaccine, 5,650 doses of H. S. Serum and 366 doses of Anthrax were obtained from the Imperial Bacteriological Laboratory, Muktesar, and distri- buted during the year. A sum of Rs. 5,647-8-0 was realised on account of Anti-rinderpest Serum, from the local bodies and credited to Government. The amount outstanding will be recovered during the next half-year, as ac- counts are submitted half-yearly. The total cost of Serum supplied to Cham- paran District Board amounted to Rs. 5,612-8-0. Dep6ts for Serum, Vaccine, etc., will be opened during the coming year at Muzaffarpur and Cuttack, and will be placed in charge of the local Veterin- ary Assistants. TABLE IV. This table shows the work of the Itinerant Veterinary Assistants, and of such Stationary Veterinary Assistants as toured during the year in the mufassil, in addition to carrying on their hospital work. On the 1st of April 1914 there were 41 Itinerant Veterinary Assistants on the roll, including those in charge of four combined appointments of Ranchi, Palamau, Manbhum and Hazaribagh. During the year the number was increased to 52 by the addition of 3 Bihari and one Oriya graduates, who passed from the Veterinary College, three Bengali and one Madrasi Veterinary Assistants, and one Bihari Veterinary Assistant from Dumraon, not in Government service before, as well as two Urdu- speaking graduates of the Punjab Veterinary College ; but out of this number, the Itinerant Veterinary Assistant of Kendrapara, Cuttack, Babu J. N. Mitter resigned ; the services of Babu M. M. Bannerjee, Veterinary Assistant of Bala- sore were placed at the disposal of the Agriculture Department, he having been recommended for the appointment of Veterinary Assistant in charge of the Sepaya Cattle Farm and Babu K. B. Lal of Gumla was dismissed for unsatis- factory work, leaving thus, at the end of the year, 49 Itinerant Veterinary Assistants. I wish to bring to notice the good work done during the year by the following assistants:6 very badly needed The new hospital at Muzaffarpur has not yet been built, but the plans and estimates are being made out by the District Engineer. New hospitals or quarters for Veterinary Assistants are in contemplation, or under construction, at Hajipur, Supaul, Dhanbad, Bhadrak, Kendrapara, Jehanabad, Nawadah and Aurangabad. The quarters for the Veterinary Assistant and an operating shed have been provided at the Monghyr Hospital. It is hoped to enclose the whole compound with a wall as soon as funds permit. The Dispensary at Begusarai was opened during the year, and is already proving a success. For want of funds nothing could be done regarding the improvement of the hospital at Bankipur, but land has been acquired on which a oattle shed, dog ward and operating theatre will be built. The Bettiah Dispensary has been enlarged during the year, and is now one of the best patronised and equipped in the Province. The reconstruction of the hospital at Cuttack has been taken up by the Chairman of the District Board. The Veterinary Assistants in charge of the following hospitals are com- mended for the work done by them during the year :7 The need of bulls in all districts of the Province where breeding on a large scale is carried on is greatly felt, but it will be a long time before anything tangible can be done, as the present breeding herds are totally inadequate in size. The plan adopted by the Bettiah Raj of confining the distribution of the bulls to the Bettiah Estate is the one most likely to give good results. It appears to me that an effort should be made to improve the cattle of Orissa by starting another cattle farm in Cuttack or Puri District, and it would be advisable during the coming year to make enquiries in those Districts with a view to selecting a suitable site. TABLES X, XI, XII. HORSE AND PONY STALLIONS. These Tables are blank, as in the previous year. TABLES XIII AND XIV. Particulars of the principal fairs and shows held in the Province are given in the above tables. Owing to the low price of jute caused by. the war the Bengal demand for cattle has been greatly curtailed, with the result that prices were quite 25 per cent. or more below those of the previous year. As an instance of the drop in the demand, it may be mentioned that only 1,149 wagons representing 9,192 cattle were carried over the Bengal and North Western Railway this year as compared with 4,004 wagons holding 32,000 head in 1913-14. I visited Sonepur, Khagra and Singeswarthan fairs to purchase elephants, but only succeeded in obtaining one at Sonepur, owing to the high prices demanded. The other large fairs, such as Bettiah, Bihta, Barahpur, Dharam- gunj, Hardi and Sitamarhi were visited either by the Veterinary Assistants or the Circle Inspectors. Temporary hospitals were opened and many animals were brought to them for treatment. At Khagra and Sitamarhi fairs demons- trations were given on the various methods of treating contagious diseases. The Inspectors have now been provided with cattle troughs for demonstrating the treatment of Foot and Mouth Disease ; this, they take from one fair to another, during the cold weather for demonstration purposes. Large numbers of pamphlets were distributed. SUBORDINATE VETERINARY ESTABLISHMENT. Table VII shows the strength of the Subordinate Veterinary Establishment during 1914-15. The number of Inspectors was the same as last year, viz., five only, but two additional posts, one on Rs. 130 and another on Rs. 70 were sanctioned, with effect from April 1915. Fifty-seven Veterinary Assistants were in Government service on 1st April 1914. As 11 Assistants joined the Department, the total number on the roll at one period was 68, but three Assistants left the Department, one was dismissed and one died, so the actual number at the end of the year was 63 only. This figure includes the five Assistants who were on the Reserve list on 31st March 1915, but not the one employed by the Bettiah Raj. The total therefore is sixty-four. As the posts at Hathwa and Dumraon and that under the Palamau En- cumbered Estate have been abolished, it is unnecessary to show them on the Departmental list any longer. The post of Itinerant Veterinary Assistant under the Sambalpur District Council remained vacant throughout the year, but that body has now agreed to provide funds from 1st April 1915. Reserve Veterinary Assistants, Babu P. Panda and D. C. Guha continued to act as Inspectors of Inoculators at Khunti and Gumla, respectively, in connection with the Cattle Inoculation Scheme.
8 The four Inspectors held charge of the same circles as in previous year, while the First Inspector, Babu P. N. Das, held a roving commission, and made special enquiries into the work of Veterinary Assistants whenever necessary. The most important duty on which he was employed during the year was in connection with the outbreak of Rinderpest in Champaran District. As usual it was performed with energy and intelligence, and 1 have pleasure in again bringing his name to the favourable notice of Government. I regret do have to state that he has had to take medical leave on account of his eye-sight, and that it is doubtful if he will be ever able to return to duty again. Inspector Babu B. L. Sur remained in charge of the Muzaffarpur Circle. His work was not satisfactory. He has been on medical leave since November owing to an attack of Typhoid fever. Inspector Sucha Singh of the Gaya Circle continued to perform his duties energetically, and attended a large number of outbreaks of cattle-disease in Gaya, Palamau and Shahabad. Veterinary Assistant Bab S.N.Chatterjee continued to act as Inspector of the 7th grade. The work of the Inspector of the Orissa Division, Babu D. N. Sirkar was fairly satisfactory. He attended outbreaks of cattle-disease in the Cuttack, Puri, Sambalpur and Singhbhum Districts. On the whole the manner in which the Inspectors and Assistants have done their work this year is worthy of much praise. Both classes have responded with energy to appeals for extra work to suppress the outbreaks of contagious diseases. RESERACH WORK. Blood slides were sent on 98 occasions by the Veterinary Assistants for examination at the Raymond Research Laboratory. The following diseases were diagnosed :TABLE II.

The Lieutenant-Governor in Council observes with regret that the inability to find trained Veterinary Assistants to fill vacancies resulted in the- closing of two out. of the twenty-two dispensaries open in the preceding year, and trusts that the same cause will not prevent the opening of the additional dispensaries which are reported to be contemplated or under construction. The increase in the number of animals treated is a satisfactory feature, but the figures do not yet indicate any great degree of appreciation of the useful- ness of these institutions on the part of the general public. 7. The Government cattle breeding farm at Sipaya, which was started during the preceding year, has made satisfactory progress. The herd has now increased to 119 head and it has been found possible to supply four bulls,ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT BIHAR AND ORISSA FOE THE YEAR 1915-16.

DAIN, ESQ., I.C.S., OFFG. DIRECTOR OF AGRICULTURE, BIHAR AND ORISSA, To THE SECRETARY TO THE REVENUE DEPARTMENT, BIHAR AND ORISSA. Dated Ranchi, the 26th July 1916. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit the Annual Report of the Civil Veteri- nary Department for the year ending 31st March 1916. Mr. Quinlan was in charge of the Department throughout the year. He was on tour for 188 days inspecting Veterinary Hospitals and Dispensaries and attending outbreaks of cattle diseases. 2. The increase in the number of students admitted to the Bengal Veteri- nary College was a satisfactory feature of the year. This may be attributed to the larger number of stipends offered at the urgent request of the Superin- tendent by the District Boards ; for out of 27 students selected for admission 25 received stipends from these bodies. But while there has been an increase in numbers, there has been no corresponding improvement in the type of candi- dates for admission. The standard of education of successful applicants was low, as is shown by the fact that out of 25 boys who appeared at the first annual examination only 15 passed. The Government stipends continued to be held by four aboriginal youths from Chota Nagpur and by the Oriya student who passed the final examination in March last. Of the four Chotanagpuri boys two got promotion to the Third year class and the other two who failed have been allowed to retain their stipends for another year. The fifth stipend has been awarded to another boy from Angul. Altogether seven students from this Pro- vince appeared at the final examination of the Bengal Veterinary College of whom six including the Oriya Government stipendiary obtained their diploma and were given appointments at once in the Department. There are still 13 posts of District and Reserve Veterinary Assistants vacant and the question of recruitment continues to present difficulties. The service at present is not attractive ; the pay is low and the work is exacting. The reorganisation will, it is hoped, improve matters when it is sanctioned and comes into force. An- other and logitimate cause of discontent is the difficulty of obtaining leave. The Department is understaffed and there is no reserve, and in consequence leave which is overdue and perhaps urgently required often cannot be obtained. This ground of complaint will be automatically removed as the cadre increases. 3. In his observations upon Table II Mr. Quinlan expresses his opinion that the improvement in the reporting of cattle disease recorded in the previous year has been maintained during the year under report. This is inconsistent with the view expressed by him a little further on that although the number of recorded deaths from Rinderpest is less than in the previous year, the actual number of deaths is greater. The fact appears to be that the reporting of cattle disease is still so inadequate that we are not in a position to make an estimate of the ratio of actual to recorded cases. The chief reason for this state of affairs is the prejudice of the high caste Hindu against in- oculation and the pressure brought to bear in the villages to prevent Chauki- dars giving any information. It is encouraging to note that in one or two cases
2 members of Co-operative Credit Societies reported outbreaks of their own accord and were instrumental in getting cattle inoculated. During the year 3,527 outbreaks were reported against 3,883 of 1914-15. The number attended also shows a decline of about 13 per cent. as compared with the previous year. The decrease is attributed by Mr. Quinlan to the wide area which the Veterinary Assistant has to cover and to the inadequacy of the staff to cope with outbreaks at different places at the same time. 4. Rinderpest and Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia continued to be the chief causes of cattle mortality in the Province. The former was responsible for about three-fourths of the total number of deaths and assumed a virulent form in the districts of the Orissa Division, especially Puri, as well as in the districts of Patna., Gaya, Shahabad, Monghyr, Palamau, Hazaribagh, Bhagalpur and Champaran. The total number of deaths from the two diseases recorded in Table II shows a decrease in comparison with last year's figures, but this, Mr. Quinlan believes, does not represent the true state of things as a large number of deaths remained unreported. Treatment by inoculation is still far from popular among the cattle-owners in spite of the best efforts of the Depart- ment in this direction, and the year under report shows a considerable decrease in the number of inoculations performed. The total number of cattle immu- nized during the year was 98,144 including 39,382 inoculated by the inocula- tors in Ranchi against 130,027 of the previous year, i.e., a decrease of 31,883. The inability of the Superintendent to tour as much as in previous years and the absence of three experienced Inspectors on leave or deputation is largely respon- sible for the decrease. There was also very strong local opposition in the area affected. The Superintendent considers that he should be armed with some power of compelling owners to have their animals inoculated. This is not feasible but it should be considered whether some indirect pressure cannot be applied by forbidding the movement of cattle from infected places. The Superintendent reports that in his opinion the Ranchi inoculation scheme does not justify its existence. He is considering, however, the number of inoculations performed by each operator and perhaps it is rather the case that certain operators have failed to justify their existence. It must be admitted however that there is again a falling off in the total number of animals immunized. I have recommended the continuance of the scheme during the current year. 5. Two dep6ts for the supply of serum and vaccine were opened during the year, one at Cuttack and the other at Muzaffarpur. The former proved very useful during the outbreak in Balasore, Cuttack, Puri and Angul. 6. The total number of hospitals open for in-patients rose from 20 to 23 by the creation of the posts of Veterinary Assistants at Dumraon and Hajipur and the opening of the hospital at Begusarai. The total number of cases treated in the hospitals showed a slight improvement. The number of new cases treated by Itinerant Veterinary Assistants also rose from 53,613 to 54,904. 7. As a result of the scheme initiated last year for the improvement of breeding operations in this Province, requisitions for bulls, cows and buffaloes increased but all of them could not be complied with. The bulls at the Govern- ment cattle-breeding farm at Sepaya are not yet ready for distribution. An Inspector was deputed to the Punjab to purchase buffalo bulls for the Bettiah Estate and others. During the year two cows and one Montgomery bull were obtained from Pusa for the Deputy Commissioner of Palamau and five heifers from the Sabour Dairy herd were supplied to him. Two Montgomery bulls, one to Sonbarsa Estate and the other to the Deputy Commissioner of Angul, were supplied from the Sabour Dairy herd. 8. The Government cattle-breeding farm at Sepaya continued to do satis- factory work. The number of the herd rose from 119 to 204 at the close of the year. A full account of this farm will be given in the Annual Report of the Agricultural Department.
3 9. The cattle-breeding farm of the Bettiah Estate continued to be con- trolled by the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, as before. The strength of the herd rose from 142 to 151 and nine bulls were distributed during the year. 10. The subordinate staff of the Civil Veterinary Department consisted of 7 Inspectors, 2 Inspectors of inoculators at Ranchi and 66 Veterinary Assistants including the one under the Bettiah Estate. The total sanctioned cadre of Veterinary Assistants is 81 including 5 Reserve Veterinary Assistants. Of these posts 13 are still vacant. 11. During the year under report an inspection of the office of the Superin- tendent, Civil Veterinary Department, by Mr. Miine disclosed several irregulari- ties in the serum accounts a thorough audit of which was undertaken at his instance by the Accountant-General, Bihar and Orissa, with the result that a bettor system was introduced for the keeping of the accounts. 12. The proposal of the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, for the Post Graduate training of Inspectors at the Punjab Veterinary College was deferred as the men could not be spared from their work. It will receive con- sideration when the staff becomes more numerous. 13. The Inspectors and Veterinary Assistants with a few exceptions did their work well. Mr. Quinlan continued to display his usual energy in the administration of the Department. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient Servant, J. R. DAIN, Offg. Director of Agriculture, Bihar and Orissa.
ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT BIHAR AND ORISSA FOR THE YEAR 1915-16. PREFACE AND GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. During the year under report I was in charge of the Civil Veterinary Department. Most of my work during this period consisted of routine inspec- tion of hospitals and dispensaries, and attending, where opportunity afforded, outbreaks of cattle disease. More attention will, however, be given to the district work of the Assistants in the ensuing year, as there is evidence of a very serious and widespread outbreak of rinderpest in the Tirhut, Patna and Orissa Divisions. I visited the cattle farms in Bettiah and Sepaya and also attended the Sone- pur Pair to purchase elephants and cattle, and, later, went to Barahpur and Bihta Pairs to secure bullocks for the Department of Agriculture and cows for the Co- operative Dairy at Bhagalpur. I attended one outbreak of Glanders in Cuttack and was present at the ninth meeting of the Board of Agriculture held at Pusa in February. I was also an Examiner at the Annual Examinations of the Bengal Veterinary College and of the Sabour Agricultural College. A tour was made in the Ranchi district during November, to inspect the work of the Inoculators. Altogether I was away from Headquarters for 188 days only during the period under report and travelled 1,991 miles by road and 6,542 miles by rail. PART I. VETERINARY INSTRUCTION. To meet the increasing demand for Veterinary Assistants, special efforts were made to secure young men for training at the Bengal Veterinary College, by addressing local bodies, and the various schools and colleges throughout the Province, through the Divisional Inspectors of Schools ; the result was satisfac- tory as 27 were selected for admission against 11 of the previous year ; of this number 19 were Hindus and 8 Muhammadans representing as regards nation- ality 22 Beharis, 3 Bengalis (domiciled) and 2 Oriyas. With the exception of two, all were granted stipends from District Boards. The Bettiah Estate gave one stipend. Although there has been a satisfactory increase in the number of students it has been very difficult to obtain a really satisfactory type owing to the inferior prospects which are open to them after joining the Department. That the standard of education of the successful applicants for stipends was not of a very high order is evident from the results of the annual examination at the Bengal Veterinary College at which only 15 boys passed out of 25 who appeared which shows that a very large proportion of those who were permitted to go up for the examinations had not sufficient general education to satisfy the exam- iners. There was no change in the number of Government stipendiaries at the beginning of the year, the same students being still present at the College. One, however, G. Giri of Cuttack, who appeared at the final examination, passed first out of the students from this Province, and with the five other successful final-year students was given immediate employment. Two of the four students
2 from Ranchi in the Second Year class failed, but in view of their backwardness when first entering the College, they will be given another chance. The stipend vacant by the success of the Oriya student in the final year will be given to another Oriya boy recommended by the Deputy Commissioner of Angul. There are at present 11 posts vacant in the Districts, but it is impossible to get men to fill them. The re-organisation scheme referred to in last year's report is, I believe, now under submission to the Government of India. It is of vital importance that something should be done to make the service attractive, in order that the help necessary to suppress the diseases which are causing such serious annual losses to cattle owners, may be forthcoming us early as possible, PART II. TREATMENT OF DISEASE. As in previous years, constant attention has been given to the reporting of outbreaks of the scheduled contagious diseases, and although the improvement recorded in 1915 has been largely maintained, serious outbreaks of cattle disease in which large numbers of animals die, still remain unreported. Various reasons may be suggested for this state of affairs ; the principal cause appears to be the pressure which is brought to bear on the chaukidars by villagers, particularly Hindus, to prevent them from giving any information concerning diseases, more specially rinderpest, as it is not looked on by local Hindus as a disease at all, but as a goddess who is supposed to take up her abode in affected animals during the period of their illness. The appearance of rinderpest in a village is not, on this account, therefore, re- garded as an evil, but as a piece of good fortune, and such being the case, they look on any form of treatment, whether by medicine or inoculation, as interfering with the deity. Under such conditions one can readily imagine that information about outbreaks is rigidly suppressed, and that in spite of the efforts made by the Police and by this Department many cattle. die about which no information is available at all. During the year, 3,527 out-, breaks were reported against 3,882 in 1914-15. Out of this number, however, only 1,631 could be attended against 2,292 of the previous year. This decrease is partly due to the fact that Veterinary Assistants have to spend a considerable time in some villages attending outbreaks or inoculating and are thus unable to give any assistance to many of those which were reported at the same time. The jurisdiction of many Veterinary Assistants is also much too large, and even if it were reduced in area, so much time would be wasted in trying to induce people to accept our methods, that many outbreaks would still remain un- attended. It is satisfactory to note that in some instances members of the Co-operative Societies have reported outbreaks of their. own accord and that in two instances in Gaya they were instrumental in getting a large number of animals inoculated. The future development of the Veterinary Department and of the success of inoculations, will depend largely on the help which the Co-operative Societies are willing to extend to the staff of the Department. EQUINES. Only one outbreak of Glanders was reported during the year. This occurred in Cuttack, and affected only one animal which died while under observa- tion. Anthrax was responsible for one death in Bhagalpur. No particulars are available regarding 15 deaths under the head of " Other. Contagious Diseases." BOVINES. Rinderpest.3 rinderpest has decreased considerably, still I regret to have again to state that the losses this year are in my opinion infinitely greater than the police figures show in Table II, as from personal observations and enquiries I am led to believe that they are even larger than they were in 1914-15, and that instead of 35,000 deaths which were then estimated as having occurred, the total for 1915-16 should be not less than 40,000, which involves an actual loss to cattle owners from rinderpest alone of Rs. 12,00,000, taking the average price at Rs. 30 per head, a sum, which if the cattle were saved by professional treatment, would be sufficient to cover the cost of the re-organised Veterinary Department for more than 3 years. Foot- and-mouth disease4 The absence of a reserve of Veterinary Assistants is seriously felt in dealing with outbreaks as many Districts and Subdivisions have to be denuded to help to suppress outbreaks in other parts of the Province. Altogether I consider, that though there has been a falling off in the number of inoculations per- formed, the Veterinary Assistants themselves have on the whole done their best to make this method of treatment popular. The remarks which I passed last year on the value of the serum as a pro- tective agency when used with a certain amount of intelligence are further strengthened by this year's experience. In one instance, however, a large number of deaths, 225, occurred after inoculations owing to the carelessness of a Veterinary Assistant in the Puri District in not injecting a suitable dose. A report was sent to the Imperial Bacteriologist. This is a demonstration of the danger which is likely to beset those officers deputed for inoculations who have not had the ordinary professional training of a Veterinary Assistant. As regards the present method of suppressing outbreaks of rinderpest I have already submitted a note to the Director of Agriculture on the subject and wish again to state that I am of opinion that the whole question ought to be examined with a view to strengthening the hands of the Department by some measure which would compel owners of cattle to allow their animals to be inoculated. The success of the serum depends on the immunization of large numbers of cattle in the neighbourhood of an outbreak, but at present owners refuse with the result that the disease continues indefinitely, causing large losses to cattle-owners in this as well as in the Provinces to the East. We are also unable to stop the movement of infected herds from grazing grounds, the consequence being that the disease is spread far and wide. Rinderpest.5 with 41,116 in 1914-15. The work done by the majority of these men has been infinitesimal and the scheme does not, in my opinion, justify its existence longer than the end of the present year unless very considerable improvement takes place in the number of cattle immunized. As in the previous years, the Gumla Circle shows more work accomplished than the Khunti Circle, the reason given last year regarding the backwardness of the people being, in my opinion, responsible for this. All Missionaries record great opposition to inoculation as the majority of the people are too ignorant to value its benefits. The number of animals temporarily protected against rinderpest is the most satisfactory portion of the year's work. Sixty-three thousand two hundred doses of Hæmor- rhagic Septicæmia Vaccine and 29,050 doses of Anti-rinderpest serum were supplied to the Missionaries from the Depôt at Ranchi. The cost of the scheme for the year under report is shown in Table XIV (b). SUPPLY OF SERUM AND VACCINE. During the year 1915-16 altogether 124,000 doses of Anti-rinderpest serum to the value of Rs. 15,500, 65,600 doses of Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia Vaccine, 12,500 doses of Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia Serum, 6,000 doses of Anti-Anthrax serum and 200 doses of Black-leg pillules were obtained from the Muktesar Laboratory for the use of the Departmental staff. A sum of Rs. 12,120 on account of the cost of Anti-rinderpest serum was recovered from the various local bodies throughout the province, and credited to Government. An audit of the office and of the serum accounts for the years 1912 to March 1915 was carried out by the Accountant-General, Bihar and Orissa, at the request of the Director of Agriculture; as a result new rules and new forms were introduced while a number of suggestions were made for the keeping of the accounts which have since been put into effect. The keeping of the serum registers as well as those connected with the supply of instruments, etc., for the kit boxes has necessitated one clerk being put on to this work alone. Two Dep6ts for serum and vaccine were opened, one at Cuttack for the Orissa Division, and the other at Muzaffarpur. The former has proved very useful during the outbreaks in Balasore, Cuttack, Puri and Angul. TABLE IV. Table IV shows the number of animals treated by Veterinary Assistants on tour. On the 1st of April 1915 there were 49 Itinerant Veterinary Assistants and since that date five new posts, i.e., Sitamarhi, Supaul, Jamalpur, Kendrapara and Bhadrak were filled bringing the total number of touring officers up to fifty-four. This includes the four posts at Ranchi, Palamau, Manbhum and Ha- zaribagh which are held by Itinerant Veterinary Assistants and the two Reserve Veterinary Assistants who are acting as Inspectors of Inoculators in Ranchi district. Veterinary Assistant K. B. Lal who was dismissed in the previous year was reinstated on appeal to the Director of Agriculture and sent to Belgachia for a course of training for 6 months. On return he was appointed to Bihar Sub-division. Another Veterinary Assistant, Babu M. Agnihotri, was sent to Allahabad Military Dairy Farm for training in modern Dairy methods and was posted to Gaya to look after the Co-operative Dairy for a short period. Sub- sequently he reverted to the Department. The following Itinerating Veterinary Assistants did good work during the year :6 Total number of new eases treated by Itinerant Veterinary Assistants amount to 54,904 as against 53,613 of the previous year ; the increase of 1,291 being satisfactory. TABLE V. At the beginning of the year, 20 hospitals were open for the accommodation of in-patients, this number at the close of the year being increased to 23 by the sanctioning of the posts of Veterinary Assistants at Dumraon and Hajipur, and the opening of the hospital at Begusarai, under the care of the Itinerant Veterinary Assistant. It is hoped to be able to supply a Veterinary Assistant for the Dumraon Hospital next year ; owing to funds not being available the Hajipur hospital buildings have not yet been started. The extensions to the Bankipur Veterinary Hospital, which are badly needed have not yet been undertaken, but the boundary walls have been completed. The new hospital at Muzaffarpur has not been put in hand for want of funds, it is very urgently required, as the present buildings are very insanitary. An operation shed has been added to the Veterinary Hospital at Cuttack, while a ward for out- patients and dog kennels have been constructed at the Bettiah Estate Hospital. The operation shed at Monghyr was completed, and opened during the year, but the other works proposed could not be carried out. The hospital at Supaul is under construction and will be opened early next year. Veterinary Assistants' quarters and dispensary buildings are badly needed at Dhanbad, Giridih, Nawadah, Jahanabad, Kishanganj, Katihar, Sasaram, Buxar, Gopalganj, Madhubani, Kendrapara and a few other subdivisions, but will have to stand over owing to shortage of funds. The following Veterinary Assistants in charge of hospitals have done good work during the year under report :7 TABLE IX. BULL BREEDING FARMS. The Bettiah Farm is still under the control of the Veterinary Department and was visited by me on two occasions during the year. The strength of the herd at present is 34 cows, 31 bull calves below 3 years of age, 20 heifers below 3 years of age, 2 stud bulls, one stud buffalo and 11 buffalo bull calves. Nine bulls were distributed during the year, making a total of 34, one having been brought back as unsuitable and castrated. No buffalo bulls were distri- buted during the year; 36 calves were born, out of which 21 were bull calves and 15 heifers, 7 of the former and 2 of the latter died, 22 animals consisting of 6 cows, 8 heifer calves and 8 bull calves were rejected and sold for a total sum of Rs. 950. Four farm bred heifers were taken into the herd while one cow died. Three bull calves were secured locally, while 11 buffalo bull calves were purchased in the Punjab for the herd during the year. Two attempts were made to secure cows in Shahabad, and in the neighbourhood of Sitamarhi and Madhubani, but owing to the high prices demanded, it was impossible to secure any. The fencing of the compounds and of the plots was completed during the year. Grazing especially on the new plots was good, while the supply of other fodder was ample. The cows have not been doing so well this year and there has been a large number of rejections. The stud bull will be changed as soon as a suitable animal is obtained. The cost of the herd during the year amounts to Rs. 9,514. SEPAYA FARM. The following is the report of the Superintendent of the Government Cattle Farm at Sepaya, Saran District:8 Railway to Assam and Eastern Bengal was 22,880 as compared with 9,192 in the previous year. I visited Sonepur, Bihta and Barahpur fairs while, Bettiah, Dharamganj, Hardi, Khagra, Singeswar and other large fairs were inspected either by the Circle Inspectors, or by the local Veterinary Assistants. Temporary hospitals were opened and demonstrations of the various methods of dealing with disease were given by the Veterinary staff. Large numbers of pamphlets were distributed. SUBORINATE VETERINARY ESTABLISHMENT. Table VII shows the strength of the Subordinate staff of the Civil Vete- rinary Department for the period ending the 31st March 1916. The number of Inspectors remained the same up till the 1st September when two more Veterinary Assistants were promoted. I regret to have to state that Babu P. N. Das is still on medical leave, and although he endeavoured to do his work for a short period, he found he could not stand the strain and had to return to hospital. Babu B. L. Sur resumed his duties on return from leave in December and since then has been doing good work. Inspector Sirdar Sucha Singh is also giving satisfaction and was of considerable assistance to the Department of Agriculture in selecting cows and bullocks. Babus D. N. Sirkar and S. N. Chattarji also performed their duties satisfactorily, the former especially having a very arduous time in attending outbreaks in the Orissa Division. Reserve Veterinary Assistants, Babus P. Panda and D. C. Guha, are still in charge of the cattle inoculation scheme in Ranchi, and are attend- ing to their duties in a satisfactory manner. As regards Veterinary Assistants there were 64 on the roll at the beginning of the year including the two Inspectors of Inoculators and the Assistant under Bettiah Estate. Five new graduates from the Bengal Veterinary College were given employment while three other Assistants, two from Bengal and one from the Punjab, were also taken into the cadre ; as Babus R. K. Ram and S. C. Bose were appointed to act as Inspectors and as one resigned and another had his services dispensed with, the total number on the 31st of March came to 68. On the whole the manner in which the Inspectors and Assistants have done their work is satisfactory. RESEARCH WORK. Veterinary Assistants still continue to send blood slides and other material to the Raymond Research Laboratory, Belgachia, for examination. During the year the following diseases were diagnosed:TABLE II. Showing number of deaths from contagious diseases amongst animals during the year 1915-16. Province. Equines Bovines. Others. Glanders.

Dated Ranchi, the 17th September 1916. Read2 5. The fall in the number of cattle inoculated by the regular staff from 85,688 to 58,762 is a disappointing set back after the rapid progress achieved in the preceding three years. The Superintendent ascribes the decrease partly to the absence on leave on deputation of three experienced Inspectors but mainly to the opposition experienced in the Bihar districts. Although the time is not yet ripe for any measure of compulsory inoculation on the lines recom- mended by Mr. Quinlan, the Lieutenant-Governor in Council is prepared to consider any feasible scheme which the Director of Agriculture may put forward to give effect to his alternative suggestion for checking the spread of cattle disease by restrictions placed on the free movement of cattle from infected areas. The results of the important experiment in inoculation against rinder pest and hæmorrhagic septicæmia in the Ranchi district by the agency or locally trained inoculators are also discouraging, but the Lieutenant- Governor in Council is not prepared to abandon the experiment without further trial, and the Director of Agriculture has been asked to examine, in consulta- tion with the local officers, the possibility of infusing fresh vitality into the scheme. 6. The number of animals treated by Itinerant Veterinary Assistants on tour rose from 53,613 in 1914-l5 to 54,904 during the year under review. There was an increase from 20 to 23 in the number of hospitals for in-patients open during the year. 7. The Government Cattle-breeding farm at Sipaya continues to make satisfactory progress, and the strength of the herd now stands at 204 as against the 51 animals with which it was started in 1914. The condition and general health of the cattle are reported to have been good. The number of requisitions for bulls is increasing, and it will be a long time before it will be possible to comply with all the applications received. 8. The thanks of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council are due to Mr. Quinlan for his efficient administration of the Department under his control.

MILNE, ESQ., I.C.S., DIRECTOR OF AGRICULTURE, BIHAR AND ORISSA, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BIHAR AND ORISSA, REVENUE DEPARTMENT. Dated Ranchi, the 14/15th August 1917. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit the Annual Report of the Civil Veteri- nary Department, Bihar and Orissa, for 1916-17. The report has been delayed over a month owing to the absence of Mr. Quinlan on privilege leave. Mr. Quinlan was in charge of the Department throughout the year and spent 285 days on tour, visiting Veterinary Hospitals and Dispensaries, inspecting the field work of Veterinary Assistants and attending outbreaks of cattle-dieases. 2. At the request of the Principal, Police Training School, Bazaribagh, a lecture on contagious cattle-diseases and the procedure for reporting them was given to the candidates for Sub-Inspectorships, and it has been decided that these lectures should, in future, form part of the regular curriculum. It is hoped that the training received by the Sub-Inspectors will add to the efficiency of the reporting agency in future. 3. Although local bodies offered a larger number of stipends and most of them increased the value of the stipends, there was no great response to the call for students for admission to the Bengal Veterinary College. During the year under report only 17 boys from this province were admitted to the Bengal Veterinary College of whom 14 are Beharis, 2 domiciled Bengalees and 1 Oriya, against 27 of last year. There was no improvement either in the class of students for admission. Of the five Government stipends for Chota Nagpur and Oriya boys, two were held by two Chota Nagpuri boys in the second year class and three remained vacant for want of suitable candidates either from Chota Nagpur or Orissa. Out of 8 students from this Province five passed the final examination of the Bengal Veterinary College. 4. The number of reported outbreaks of contagious diseases rose from 3,527 to 4,513, of which only 1,850 could be attended by the Veterinary staff. The number of deaths from all contagious diseases was 26,107 against 24,459 of last year. Rinderpest alone claimed 19,144 victims against 18,851 of the previous year. This disease was prevalent in all the districts of the Province and was particularly virulent in Shahabad, Darbhauga, Monghyr, Gaya, Palamau, Hazaribagh, Purnea and Cuttack. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia was responsible for the death of 5,584 animals against 4,016 deaths of the previous year. It caused considerable mortality in Gaya, Patna, Bhagalpur and Balasore. The only district which was free from this disease was Champaran.
2 5. As a result of the combined efforts of the Veterinary staff, the District Officials, some of the leading Zemindars and Co-operative Societies, cattle- owners in certain areas are gradually recognizing the usefulness of scientific measures for the prevention and cure of cattle-diseases. But in the majority of cases the prejudice against inoculation amongst the cultivators continued as strong as ever, and in Gaya it culminated in an assault on the Veterinary staff by some villagers with the result that the inoculating staff had to be withdrawn. The great drawbacks are, as pointed out before, the absence of legal authority to enforce the inoculation and isolation of cattle and also the temporary nature of the immunity conferred by the vaccines and sera. It is, however, satisfactory to note that the number of cattle immunized during the year amounted to 118,788 as compared with 98,144 in 1915-16 and that the percentage of death among cattle inoculated against rinderpest was as low as 4 per cent. The Veterinary staff inoculated 89,118 animals while 29,670 were inoculated by the Ranchi inoculators. The Superintendent thinks that a much larger number could have been inoculated if he had a sufficient number of Veterinary Assistants under him. Another satisfactory feature of the report is that Co- operative Societies are evincing more interest in cattle inoculation. Two outbreaks of Glanders were reported during the year, one from the Hazaribagh Pinjrapole and the other from Angul. Revised rules and notifica- tions under the Glanders and Farcy Act have been framed and are under the consideration of Government. 6. Although the Ranchi inoculation scheme has not achieved the results expected of it, some measure of success has been obtained where the Missiona- ries took an active interest in the work of the inoculators under their supervision. There was a further falling off in the number of inoculations performed by the Ranchi. inoculators, and it was decided to restrict the working of the scheme to a more limited area with a smaller staff. 7. Of the three serum dep6ts at Ranchi, Cuttack and Muzaffarpur, the last was closed owing to the comparative rareness of outbreaks in Tirhut. The dep6ts at Ranchi and Cuttack worked satisfactorily. 8 The number of Veterinary hospitals remained the same as in the previous year. The hospital at Dumraon had to be closed for want of a Veterinary Assistant. The number of animals treated at all hospitals during the year was 28,180 against 26,213 of the previous year. The number of cases treated by itinerant Veterinary Assistants was 55,311 against 54,904 of the previous year. 9. The Government cattle-breeding farm at Sepaya continued to show good results. The number of the herd rose from 204 to 256 at the close of the year. There were eight young bulls of breeding age for disposal on the farm during the year under report. One will be retained as a prospective stud-bull and the others distributed to District Boards and Co-operative Societies. Two bull- calves and 17 young female calves were rejected from the herd and sold by public auction, the price realized amounting to Rs. 725. 10. The cattle-breeding farm of the Bettiah Raj continued to be managed under the supervision of the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department. The strength of the herd was supplemented by 20 cows and 16 bull-calves selected by the Superintendent from Shahabad, Ballia and Bhagalpur. Nine bulls and five buffalo-bulls were distributed from the herd. 11. The subordinate staff of the Civil Veterinary Department at the close of the year consisted of seven Inspectors and 70 Veterinary Assistants. 12. The Inspectors and Veterinary Assistants are reported to have worked satisfactorily on the whole. Mr. Quinlan continued to exercise efficient control and supervision over the Department single-handed throughout the year. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient Servant, G. MILNE, Director of Agriculture, Bihar and Orissa.
[Maximum Limit2 PART II. TREATMENT OF DISEASE. There is nothing to add to the remarks made in last year's report, regarding the incidence of contagious disease in the Province. Rinderpest was more prevalent, and under present conditions is, practically speaking, uncontrollable. 4,513 outbreaks of all the contagious diseases were brought to the notice of the staff as compared with 3,527 in 1915-16, an increase of 986. In only 1,850 cases, however, could help be given as compared with 1,631 in the previous year, which is satisfactory, when it is considered that there was only a small increase in the number of Assistants employed, and that in many instances, it was found necessary to draft them to distant districts for considerable periods, leaving less severe outbreaks in their own jurisdictions unattended ; many of them had also to be given leave, which increased the size of the areas supervised by their locum tenens who were mostly Veterinary Assistants employed in other Subdivisions of the same district. The total number of animals reported to have been attacked by, and to have died during the year from, all diseases was 81,350 and 26,107, respectively. Attention has been given to the question of getting members of the Co-operative Societies to help in outbreaks, but there is still much spade work to be done as Hindu influence in many districts is still lined up against the efforts of the Registrar, Co-operative Societies and this Department. In Gaya opposition was so active that riots occurred ; and an Inspector and a Veterinary Assistant were assaulted and the inoculating staff had in consequence to be withdrawn. The guilty parties were prosecuted and punished. It was a matter of satisfaction to find that Brahmins in the eastern part of the Samastipur Subdivision, near the Monghyr-Bhagalpur border, accepted inoculation without objection, and appeared surprised and pleased that Government should have established a department to deal with disease among their cattle. This is a very backward part of the District and had never before been visited by the staff and only rarely by other Government officials, except the Police. The names of Indian gentlemen who helped the Department, and influenced villagers to accept inoculations in some of the bad outbreaks, were brought to the notice of the District officers. EQUINES. Glanders.3 disease appears to have been introduced into Darbhanga and Muzaffarpur by cattle from the District coming in contact in the grazing grounds in Begusarai and Monghyr Sadr Subdivisions with animals brought from Gaya and Patna, where there had been severe outbreaks some time earlier in the year. Enquiries made in Samastipur pointed to considerable mortality in these grazing areas, but it was impossible to get much information on this point from the goalas, as they were very reticent and truculent. Attempts made to immunize their cattle were complete failures, and they threatened to remove their stock if persisted in. The District Magistrate, Monghyr, and the Vice-Chairrnan, District Board, Rai Bahadur Lachmi Prashad, took considerable trouble in these outbreaks, but their efforts met with no better success. In Shahabad, it appears to have been spread by the animals sent for grazing to the hills in the south of the District bringing it back with them to the villages on their return, and also by the droves passing through from Mirzapur, Ghazipur and Benares districts of the United Provinces, which border it on the west and north. Though prevalent in Sasaram during the previous cold weather, its first appearance in Buxar Subdivision was in July in a few villages in the southern thanas. Some inoculations were carried out by the Veterinary Assistant with difficulty, but it failed to cross the East Indian Railway main line to the diara owing, in my opinion, to the complete isolation of most of the villages by the floods., which interfered with the movement of the cattle to a great extent during the rains. With the aid of the Inspector and Veterinary Assist- ants, who were brought in to assist the local staff, statistics of mortality were collected in 273 villages, and it was found that 6,810 deaths occurred out of 9,492 affected ; 2,789 deaths occurred in Sasaram, 1,384 in Bhabua, 2,629 in Buxar and 8 in Sadr Subdivision. The high mortality was, I think, due to the bad conditions under which the cattle had to remain, during the long period when the country was under water, which was practically during the greater part of July, and the whole of August, September and October; the death-rate appears to have been highest after the floods. The early flooding of the eastern portions of the Samastipur Subdivision, and the Sadr Sub- divisions of Darbhanga and Muzaffarpur helped, I believe, to check the spread of the disease to other parts of Tirhut for similar reasons. In Purnea a large number of deaths took place principally along the north bank of the Ganges, and in the southern thanas of the Sadr Subdivision. In conse- quence of the absence of roads in this district, many outbreaks had to remain unattended. Similar remarks apply to Shahabad, and the south-eastern parts of Darbhanga where touring can be done, only with the help of elephants in the rains, or in the cold weather. In Hazaribagh, the disease was very virulent for a time, and caused a large number of deaths in the neighbourhood of Hazaribagh town. The cattle of the Reformatory School were inoculated, but ten deaths occurred out of 25 attacks owing to insufficient doses having been employed. The total number of deaths reported from all districts is 19,144 out of 33,970 animals affected in 1,829 outbreaks. The Veterinary Assistants attended 914 out of this number, and could not give assistance at any others for the reasons already noted in previous paragraphs. The suppression of information regarding outbreaks continued as in previous years, and it is with the greatest difficulty that chaukidars can be got to help, owing to the pressure brought to bear on them by villagers. Foot-and-mouth disease.4 Black-quarter.5 departmental staff, and 8,092 by the Ranchi Inoculators. 11,937 were pro- tected in Shahabad, 8,593 in Darbhanga, 6,768 in Manbhum, 5,142 in Gaya, mostly in the Sadr Subdivision, and 2,553 in Puri. Outbreaks in Monghyr, Cuttack, Hazaribagh, Muzaffarpur and Bhagalpur were also attended with considerable success. The total number of animals which died after inocula- tion, amounts to 288 only as compared with 484 of the previous year when fewer inoculations had been done. This represents a death-rate of only 0.4 per cent. which is satisfactory. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia.6 TABLE IV. No very great increase in the number of the staff employed can be shown during the year. Fifty-one Itinerant Veterinary Assistants were on the roll on the 1st of April, while 6 new graduates of the Veterinary College joined, and were posted to Ramnagar, Motihari Sadr, Gaya Sadr, Gumla, Bhadrak and Jajpur, bringing the total up to 57. Owing to two Assistants, Babu G. B. Mitter and Maulavi A. Halim resigning, and another Amirullah Khan, who came from the Punjab having had his services transferred to the Civil Veterinary Department, United Provinces, and a fourth, Babu K. C. Chatterjee joining the Military Department on the 1st of October, the number of Assistants at the end of the year was 53 only, excluding the two Reserve Veterinary Assistants, who were employed in Ranchi as Inspectors of Inoculators. Owing to the prevalence of outbreaks, it was impossible to send any of them for training to Muktesar or to Dairy Farms. The following Assistants worked satisfactorily :7 Twenty-eight thousand one hundred and eighty animals were attended at the Hospitals as compared with 26,213 in 1915-16. Table V gives particulars of the working of the hospitals. TABLE VIII . BREEDING OPERATIONS. Table VIII shows the number of bulls maintained in the districts during the year. Only four requisitions for the purchase of animals were received, but none of these could be met owing to the Inspectors being employed in attending outbreaks. Two buffalo-bulls were secured from the Military Dairy Farm at Allahabad for the Hazaribagh Reformatory School and for a Zemindar in North Monghyr. They were very good animals from she-buffaloes giving large milk yields; they are reported to be doing satisfactorily. Twenty cows and sixteen bull-calves were selected in Shahabad, Ballia and Bhagalpur for the cattle-breeding farm at Bettiah. TABLE IX. BULL-BREEDING FARM. Bettiah Farm.8 TABLES XIII AND XIV. These tables refer to the principal fairs and shows held in the province during the past year. There was a greatly increased demand for cattle in this Province; large numbers were exported to Bengal and Assam, the Bengal and North-Western Railway transporting 32,792 animals, as compared with 22,880 in 1915-16. Prices in the case of bullocks and buffaloes remained practically stationary, but there was a considerable advance in the case of milch cows, owing to the numbers which are now required to meet the demands of the Calcutta and other Bengal markets. This year I was able to visit Barahpur Fair only, but the Circle Inspectors were present at Sonepur, Bettiah, Khagra, Dharamganj, Singeswar and other fairs in their circles. Temporary hospitals were erected and demonstrations given on the treatment of foot-and-mouth disease and in the methods of inoculating against the different contagious diseases. Enquiries were made into the water-supply on the roads leading to the Hiranpur market in the Santal Parganas, and as a result of the suggestions made in the report, the Deputy Commissioner has allotted funds to provide tanks and wells as cattle suffer severely during the hot weather months. SUBORDINATE VETERINARY ESTABLISHMENT. The strength of the subordinate staff of the Department for the year is given in Table VII. No increase in the number of Inspectors took place. One of the Senior Inspectors, Babu P. N. Das, remained on medical leave up to the 16th of March when he resumed his work. Babu B. L. Sur, Sirdar Sucha Singh and R. K. Ram performed their duties in suppressing outbreaks of cattle-disease in their circles in a most satisfactory manner. Babu S. C. Bose worked satisfactorily in his Circle. He was deputed to Singhbhum during the months of May and June to make enquiries into the hide trade in that District. The report submitted by him was an interesting one and his work was commended by the Deputy Commissioner. Babus S. N. Chattarji and D. N. Sarkar performed their duties in a fairly satisfactory manner. The Reserve Veterinary Assistants, Babus P. Panda and D. C. Guha were in charge of the Inoculators in Ranchi and must be recommended for their works. The total number of Veterinary Assistants was increased to 74 by the employment of 6 new graduates of the Bengal Veterinary College. One Assistant died, two resigned and another was transferred to the United Provinces, thus the total number at the end of the year was reduced to 70. RESEARCH WORK. Beyond the diagnosis of slides sent to the Bengal Veterinary College, no Research work has been carried out. It will soon be necessary, however, to make arrangements for the training of the Inspectors to carry out work of this character in their own circles. The employment of an Inspector to take charge of the professional portion of the office work, and to help in a small Laboratory, which it is proposed to start, is also becoming urgent. D.

No. 43GOVERNMENT OP BIHAR AND ORISSA. REVENUE DEPARTMENT. No. 5601/Vety.2 brained inoculators, which was introduced as an experiment in 1913, was in force throughout the Ranchi district; and though the number of inoculations for both Hemorrhagic Septicæmia and Rinderpest shows a falling off in some parts of the district, a considerable measure of success was obtained where the Missionaries took an active interest in the work of the inoculators. It has been decided to continue the scheme in a modified form with a smaller staff working over a more limited area, and the Director of Agriculture has been asked to 3 ubmt a further report on the subject before the close of the year. 5. The Government cattle breeding farm at Sipaya continued to do useful work. The number of the herd at the close of the year was 256 as compared with 204 at the close of 1915-16. Of the eight young bulls of breeding age for disposal in the farm, seven are being distributed to local bodies and one is being kept on the farm as a prospective stud bull. A proposal to acquire, at an estimated cost of half a lakh of rupees, an additional 150 acres of land to provide adequate grazing ground for the full strength of the herd has recently been sanctioned. 6. The thanks of the Lieutenant Governor in Council are due to Mr. Quinlan for his efficient control of the Department during the year. By order of the Lieutenant Governor in Council, H. COUPLAND, Secretary to the Government of Bihar and Orissa. Memo. No. 5602/Vety.ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT BIHAR AND ORISSA FOR THE TEAR 1917-18.

DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE. BIHAR AND ORISSA. No. 5817/1R-28of 1918 From G. MILNE, Esq., i.c.s., DIRECTOR of AGRICULTURE, BIHAR and ORISSA, To The SECRETARY to the GOVERNMENT of BIHAR AND ORISSA, REVENUE DEPARTMENT. Dated Ranchi, the 12th July 1918. Sir, I have the honour to submit the Annual Report of the Civil Veteri- nary Department, Bihar and and Orissa, for the year 1917-18. The two principal subjects of interest (1) the reorganization of the Veterinary Department and (2) the Inoculation scheme have been dealt with in the course of correspon- dence with Government. A map showing the areas in the province where outbreaks of cattle- diseases occurred in 1917-18 is a new feature of the Report. It is instructive as visualising the omnipresence of cattle-disease throughout the province. I have no other comment or criticism to make on the report. Mr. Quinlan continued to exercise efficient control and supervision over the Department single-handed. The Inspector and Veterinary Assistants are reported to have worked satisfac- torily. The Officer Commanding A. S. O. Euphratis Defences highly com- mended the work done in Mesopotamia by the Veterinary Assistant Babu K. C. Chatterji deputed to the Military Department from this Province. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, G. MILNE, Director of Agriculture, Bihar and Orissa.

THE PROVINCE OF BIHAR AND ORISSA Showing the Districts where outbreaks of cattle disease occured in 1917-18 Scale 1 Inch=32 Miles [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page]
[Maximum Limit2 The following statement shows the number of students from this province who appeared at the Annual Examinations :3 and the local inoculators. The deaths were 1,217 recorded in 72 villages. In Cuttack, the disease affected a large area in Tirtol and neighbouring thanas and caused considerable mortality, 1,954 deaths having been reported from 173 villages by the close of the year. This outbreak was the more difficult to deal with owing to the strength and persistence of local religious prejudice opposed to any kind of interference with the cattle : and a number of villages had to be reported to the District Magistrate for failure to give assistance or for active obstruction of the staff, while the Inspector in charge of this circle was found to have neglected his duty and has been suitably dealt with. It is satisfactory to have to report that Shahabad which suffered so severely in the previous year, was practically free from the disease. In Gaya and Monghyr, a considerable number of cattle died, but it is possible that some of the deaths may have been due to parasitic enteritis, which the Inspector reported was bad in the inundated area in October, November and December. In the affected districts 14,390 deaths occurred out of 33,979 attacked in 1,058 outbreaks. Of this number, the Veterinary Assistants could attend only 675 outbreaks against 914 in the previous year. More attention will be given to this subject in future. Foot and Mouth Disease.4 Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia.5 Rupees 24,304-6-0 for anti-rinderpest serum and Us. 5,387-12-0 on account of other kinds of sera and vaccines, or a total of Rs. 29,692-2-0 includ- ing a balance of Rs. 10,386-10-0 of the previous year was realized from the local bodies and credited to Government. A sum of Rs. 9,657-12-0 still remains to be collected from local bodies for the serum issued during the period under report. TABLE IV. Eifty-three Itinerant Veterinary Assistants were on the roll on the 1st of April. During the year four new graduates joined. Two Itinerant Assistants were deputed to the Military Department, one was transferred to Gumla as Inspector of Inoculators, one was appointed stationary veterinary assistant of Sitamarhi and another was dismissed for failing to join his post. There were therefore on the 31st March 1918, fifty-two assistants available for itinerating work. The number of cases treated during the period was 69,122, as compared with 55,311 in 1916-17, the increase being due mainly to foot and mouth disease. The new dispensary building at Nawada was completed and the con- struction of other dispensaries at the subdivisional headquarters in Gaya district will be undertaken by the District Board in 1918-19. A new dispen- sary was erected by the District Board, Cuttack, at Kendrapara. The old excise godowns and quarters at Bargarh have been taken over by the Deputy Commissioner, Sambalpur, and will be used as a dispensary after some altera- tions have been effected. Several other Boards have promised to take up the question of providing dispensaries during the coming year as the conditions under which many of the veterinary assistants have to carry on their work are very insanitary and do not help to attract young men to the profession. TABLE V. There was no increase in the number of hospitals during the year. No stationary veterinary assistant was appointed to Supaul. The new hospital buildings at Muzaffarpur are under construction and will be completed shortly. A site was acquired for hospital at Ranchi, but funds are not yet available for buildings ; the District Board, Manbhum, has undertaken to build and equip a hospital for the coal-fields at Dhanbad. The number of patients treated continues to be satisfactory as 30,820 came to the hospitals against 28,180 in 1916-17. This is exclusive of the number of castrations which amounted to 540. The receipts shown in column 18 of the table represents the actual amount derived from fees, etc. and do not include contributions or local fund grants. The attention of local bodies has frequently been drawn to the necessity of keeping expenditure within reasonable bounds by scrutinising accounts but in many cases these recommendations have not been put in operation. TABLE VIII. BREEDING OPERATION. The number of bulls maintained in the districts is shown in Table VIII. The District Board of Patna obtained two bull calves from the Pusa Farm at an average price of Rs. 98 each. TABLE IX. BULL-BREEDING FARMS. The Bettiah Raj Farm under the Court of Wards.6 During the year, 18 bull calves and 18 heifer calves were born while 3 farm bred heifers were entered in herd register. Six bull calves, 4 heifer calves and 1 cow died. 44 animals were rejected out of which 18 were sold for Rs. 329-8-0 and the remainder made over to the Raj; 13 heifer calves not required for breeding purpose at the Government Cattle Farm at Sepaya were secured for the farm at a cost of Rs. 236 ; five desi and 7 buffalo bulls were distributed during the period. Three bulls previously distributed to Shikarpur, Byreah and Ghyree Factories were returned for treatment at the Bettiah Veterinary Hospital. The services of the buffalo bulls were in demand but the cultivators show great reluctance to take over the desi bulls. No contagious disease broke out among the cattle and the condition of the herd was fairly satisfactory. The total cost amounted to Rs. 8,369. The Government cattle breeding Farm at Sepaya.7 Reserve Veterinary Assistant, Babu P. Panda, acted as Inspector of Inoculators at Gumla till the end of May, after which he was relieved by Babu R. N. Pundit and posted to Balasore. Babu D. C. Guha, on being relieved of his special duties as Inspector of Inoculators continues to act as Reserve Veterinary Assistant but officiated as Inspector on two occasions and performed his duties in a satisfactory manner. Babu R. N. Pundit, who was in charge of the Ranchi inoculators, did fairly well. Altogether 73 Veterinary Assistants were employed during the year includ- ing two reserve assistants and one under the Bettiah Raj; of these, 3 Veteri- nary Assistants, Babus S. Chakravarti, P. C. Bhattacharjee and M. P. Pillai, were deputed to the Military Department and one was dismissed, while Babu J. L. Bose of Bhagalpur was deputed to Angul as Kheddah Officer. The number actually employad in the Province was therefore 68 at the end of the year or 2 less than the previous year. The services of Babu J. L. Mitter, who was deputed to Pusa for five years in 1912 have been retained by the Indian Research Fund Association for another two years. The following Veterinary Assistants are commended for good work :by years. As increasing difficulty is being experienced by District Officers in supervising the work of the subordinate staff it will be necessary in the near future to take over complete control of the Veterinary Assistants if efficiency is to be maintained. This will involve a further increase in office staff and diminish touring and inspections by the Superintendent. D.

[Maximum limit2 The following statement shows the results of the annual examinations of the students from this Province :3 Altogether, 20,972 deaths are reported to have occurred out of 53,738 animals attacked, in 1,959 outbreaks. Veterinary Assistants attended 1,423 outbreaks against 675 and 914 respectively, in the years 1917-18, and 1918-17. The rise in the attendance is satisfactory when the difficulties under which the staff worked are taken into consideration. Foot and Mouth disease.4 Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia.5 TABLE IV. On the 1st April 1918 there were 52 itinerant Veterinary Assistants on the roll. Twelve new graduates joined during the year, making the total sixty-four. Out of this number, one Assistant died, one was discharged, two were appointed stationary Assistants and one was brought on to the staff as a Laboratory Assistant. Thus, at the end of the year there were 59 itinerant Veterinary Assistants. The total number of fresh cases treated by the Assistants was 40,319 which represents a decrease of 28,803 as compared with the number treated in the previous year, which is not satisfactory. The cause of this decrease may be put down to (1) absence of many Veterinary Assistants on leave through sickness or other cause, the dispensaries remaining vacant during the period of absence, e.g., the dispensaries at Kishanganj, Supaul, Bettiah, Chapra Sadr, Deoghar, Khunti, Khurda, Khondmals and Sambalpur Sadr, remained closed for considerable periods, (2) less cattle disease, especially Foot and Mouth disease which used in former years to swell the numbers considerably, (3) want of a leave reserve. The number of villages visited by Veterinary Assistants was 16,S32 as compared with 15,107 in 1917-18. TABLE V. Though a new hospital was opened at Siwan,the total number remained the same, viz., 2-4, as in the previous year, the reason being that the two hospitals at Muzaffarpur have been combined in the new building which was completed and opened during the year. No Stationary Veterinary Assistant was appointed to Siwan but the post at Supaul was filled. The hospital at Dumraon remained vacant. The hospital at Hajipur has not yet been constructed. The hospital at Balasore was in charge of the Sadr itinerant Veterinary Assistant. The Patna Municipality have agreed to enlarge the present hospital, and it is hoped to finish it during the next year. Government has been asked to contribute a sum of lis. 10,000 towards the cost. A veterinary hospital with quarters for an Assistant is badly needed at Puri. Singhbhum also requires a veterinary hospital, but as the Road Committee is unable to meet the entire charge, it is proposed to apply to Government for help. Sites have been selected at Madhubani and Samastipur in Darbhanga District and at Bagaha in Cham- paran District instead of Ramnagar. Quarters have been sanctioned by the District Board for the Bettiah Veterinary Assistant as those now occupied by him are quite uninbabitable. At Gopalganj, a site was also selected and it is understood the District Board will acquire it during 1919-20. The District Board, Shahabad, have agreed to construct hospitals at Sasaram, Bhabua and Buxar, and two of these will probably be put in hand during the coming year. Similarly, in Purnea sites have been chosen at Kishanganj, Katihar and Araria. The District Board may also erect a hospital at Damdaha, as this part of the District has developed considerably in recent years. The hospital at Dhanbad has not yet been put in hand, but the material has been collected and it is hoped to open it before the end of the current year. In Orissa, hospitals and quarters are very badly needed; it is hoped Government will arrange to allot funds to meet a portion of the cost, as the resources of local bodies are very meagre. Type plans and estimates of hospital buildings have been prepared, and are now available for the guidance of local bodies. The question of quarters, and general good living conditions for the staff in the mufassal, is a very important one, and every effort will be made to get them provided by local bodies as early as funds will permit ; but Government must be prepared to help substantially in districts which have small revenue at their disposal. 28,528 fresh patients were treated at the hospitals, against 30,820 in 1917-18.
6 In connextion with the inspexion of hospitals and dispensaries, very few district officials now visit them, the reason being that they have so little time at their disposal ; members of local bodies also appear to take very little interest in what is being done, except in Gaya, Patna, Shahabad and Monghyr which are inspected fairly regularly. TABLE VIII. BREEDING OPERATIONS. There is nothing of importance to record under this head, short staff preventing any development. Babu P. N. Das, First Inspector, and Sirdar Sucha Singh, Inspector, Muzaffarpur Circle, were deputed to Purnea and Champaran respectively to make enquiries into the state of the cattle breeding industry and the condition of the grazing grounds. The report submitted by they former was very interesting and covers much ground, but would have been much fuller had he had sufficient time at his disposal. It, however, helps to show up the urgent necessity of taking steps for the improvement of cattle in that District. The report on Champaran contains little beyond what we already know of conditions in that area. Shahabad District Board have agreed to take up the question of cattle improvement, and have made a start by placing ton bulls in a group of villages near the Ganges, north of Dumraon, Twenty-seven bulls of breeding age were distributed from the Sipaya. Farm as follows :7 In order to introduce new blood, a bull was procured from Hissar. He will prove a useful animal when full grown. His price was Rs. 400. The old stud bull was replaced by one farm-bred bull ; 5 bull-calves and 5 heifer-calves died ; 30 animals, comprising 5 old and useless bull-buffaloes, 12 heifers, 12 bull-calves and 1 cow were rejected ; 13- desi bulls and L buffalo were distributed. Of the rejected lot, 13 were made over to the Raj gari, and 17 were sold, the sale proceeds, Rs. 333 being credited to the Raj account.. An outbreak of black-quarter occurred among the farm cattle, and five calves died of the disease. Up-keep cost Rs. 13,354 compared with Rs. 8,369 in 1917-18, the excess expenditure being due mainly, to the increase in the cost of concen- trated food. Government Cattle Breeding Farm at Sipaya. The herd, at the end of the year, consisted of 3 bulls, 103 cows, 40 male and 14 female calves two to four years old, 39 male and 22 female calves one to two years old, 107 calves at heel, and 81 farm bullocks ; or, a total 112 cattle against a stock of 382 on the 1st April. 46 male and 51 female calves were born during the year. One old cow of the Siripur herd, and 3 male and 5 female calves die 1 during the year ; 16 female calves were sold for Rs. 353. 15 female calves were sold to the Bettiah farm ; and 4 old Siripur cows were removed. In addition to these, 27 bulls of breeding age were sold to different local authorities for Rs. 4,480, vide Table VIII. The number of farm bullocks was increased by four animals received from the Bankipore farm, making the total 84. The farm was free from contagious diseases, but 102 cases of general ailment were treated during the year. The maintenance charges of the herd including the salary of the Superin- tendent, amounted to Rs. 45,963. TABLES X, XI AND XII. (BLANK) TABLES XIII & XIV. Details of fairs and shows are given in the above Tables. The close of the war in November had a marked effect on the exportation of stock from the Province, e.g., 23,640 animals were carried by the Bengal and North- Western Råilway to stations in the eastern Provinces, as compared with 7,672 cattle in 1917-188 been given him, as the work done during his deputation has been highly spoken of. He is working at present on " flies " in the Laboratory of the Lahore Veterinary College ; before he takes over charge, it has been decided to allow him to take out a six months' post-graduate course at the college. Babu S. N. Chattarji was appointed to the Rs. 90 grade sub. pro tem. in conse- quence of inspector Babu D. N. Sirkar's reversion to the post on Rs. 70. The latter officer is still on long leave. Babu B. L. Sur, in addition to his ordinary work, was deputed under the orders of the Munitions Board, to tour through the Province in order to demonstrate the flaying and curing of hides. He dis- charged his duties satisfactorily, and his work was commended by the Controller. Sirdar Sucha Singh, besides his routine duties, was also employed on an enquiry into the condition of cattle and the grazing grounds in Champaran. He was sent to Lucknow and Ballia for selection of bulls and purchased cows for the Turkaulia Factory. Babus S. N. Chattarji, S. C. Bose and R. K. Ram and Officiating Inspector, Babu D C. Guha, as usual, attended outbreaks and helped in the inoculation of cattle in their respective circles. They did their work satisfactorily. Babu P. Panda, after receiving a course of special instruction at the Muktesar Laboratory, joined the staff as Laboratory Assistant on Rs. 75-5/3-105 from the 1st December 1918. Inspector of Inoculators, Babu R. N. Pandit a very promising young man, I regret to say died of influenza, when returning from Kasauli where he had been undergoing anti-rabic treatment. The total number of Veterinary Assistants employed during the year was 79, excluding six Assistants on deputation. Of these, two Assistants, viz., J. J. Das and R. N. Pundit died, one was discharged and one Babu D. C. Guha was made Officiating Inspector. Thus, at the end of the year, the number actually employed was 75, including the Assistant under the Bettiah Raj. The following worked satisfactorily :TABLE II.

[Maximum Limit2 The following table shows the results of the annual examination of the students from this province : 2 and caused considerable losses to cultivators. The outbreak in the Sadr Sub- division of Marbhum, though widespread, was mild in character. 11,572 deaths were recorded out of 27,637 animals attacked in 1,228 out- breaks. 835 outbreaks were attended by the staff against 1,123 and 675 in the last and preceding year respectively. Foot-and-mouth disease.4 immunized being 11,754 only in 93 outbreaks as compared with 26,128 animals in 148 outbreaks during 1918-19. The figure includes 1,177 inocula- tions against 3,075, done by the inoculators in Ranchi and Pokhuria. Only 7 inoculated cattle died. Anthrax.5 One additional post for an itinerant veterinary assistant was sanctioned for Purnea Sadr with headquarters at Dhamdaha, and it is proposed to appoint another assistant to Barahpore in the Buxar Subdivision of Arrah District to help in the improvement of live-stock. TABLE V. As in the previous year, there were 21 hospitals open. A stationary Veterinary assistant having been appointed to Purulia, five hospitals, i.e., Dumka, Ranchi, Hazaribagh, Palamau and Begusarai remained in charge of itinerant veterinary assistants. The hospital at Dumraon was vacant as before, while hospital buildings were not erected at Hajipur or Dhanbad as anticipated. A stationary veterinary assistant was sanctioned for Hazaribagh during the year but the post was not filled for want of staff. The rebuilding of the veterinary hospital at Bankipore is still under consideration but it is hoped funds will be available to complete it before the close of the current year. The proposals for the construction of hospitals at Puri and Khurda did not eventuate owing to the financial condition of the District Boards; they are both essential ; the former especially, in view of the development of the town. Proposals have been placed before Government for a contribution towards the cost of the Chaibasa and Dumka hospitals. The enlargement of the Ranchi hospital is urgent and it is hoped that with help from Government, an up-to-date institution will be built. The District Boards shown below contemplate constructing hospitals or dispensaries during 1920-21 :6 TABLE IX. BULL-BREEDING FARMS. The Bettiah Raj Farm.7 was also present at the Khagra Mela, and, the other fairs were attended by the circle inspectors or assistants. A cattle and poultry show was organized by the Deputy Superintendent, Babu P. N, Das, as part of the Bihar and Orissa Exhibition, but the number of exhibits was small in spite of every effort to bring in cattle from the neighbouring districts. The officiating inspector of the Arrah Circle, Babu N. N. Ghose, made arrangements for the Niazipur show in Shahabad District. It proved a success A new fair has been started near Motipore Station, Muzaffarpur District, and is likely to develop into a very important one as it is under the supervision of the Manager of the Motipur Concern. 20,448 animals were transported by the Bengal and North-Western Rail- way to the eastern provinces as compared with 23,640 in 1915-19. PROVINCIAL ESTABLISHMENT. The reorganization scheme of the Department which received the sanction of the Secretary of State for India during the year was brought into operation in July and with the better prospects now open to all members of the Department, considerable improvement in the number and quality of subordinate officers may be anticipated. Three Deputy Superintendents posts on Rs. 2008 Of the remaining six inspectors, Babu J. L. Mitter died, Balm S. X. Chatterji went through a nine months' course at the Madras Veterinary College and resumed charge of the Cuttack Circle in March. Veterinary assistants, Babus M. Agnihotri and P C. Bhattacharji were promoted tempo- rarily to the grade of Inspectors on the 16th July, 1919, and placed in charge of the Motihari and Muzaffarpur Circles, respectively. Veterinary assistant, Babu N. N. Ghose, acted as officiating inspector, first of the Cuttack Circle and subsequently of the Patna and Gaya Circles. Babu D. C Guha continued to act as temporary inspector, Purnea Circle. The work of the Inspectors was, on the whole, satisfactory. As regards the veterinary assistants, 91 including one under the Bettiah Raj were on the roll during the year. Of these, two, viz., Babus J. L. Bose and M. M. Banarji were on deputation, the former as khedda officer in Angul, and the hitter at the cattle-breeding farm at Sipaya ; three assistants as noted above, were appointed inspectors, two were dismissed, one removed, one resigned and one died. There were, therefore., eighty-one assistants at the end of the year. Twenty-seven assistants were absent on leave for various periods during the year. The work of the following veterinary assistants is commended :TABLE II. Showing number of deaths from contagious diseases amongst animals during the year 1919-20. Provinces . Equines. Bovines.

READ2 6. Details explaining the effect of the reorganization of the Veterinary Department have been published in the Local Government's Resolution No. 1070-R., dated the 2nd February 1920. It is too early as yet to fore- tell the results on the efficiency of the service of the very considerable improvements which have been effected in the pay and prospects of the staff. The appointment of an additional Imperial Officer to Bihar and Orissa, will, as soon as he has completed his training in the ensuing cold weather, relieve Mr. Quinlan of a portion of his administrative duties, which have for some time been too heavy for a single officer ; and both officers should thus be able to devote more time by encouraging and assisting local bodies in carrying out duties, which, it must be recognized, will, with the development of Local Self- Government, fall with increasing weight on the District Boards of the province. 7. The thanks of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council are again duo to Mr. Quinlan, for his energetic administration of the department under his control. The Lieutenant-Governor in Council trusts that with intro- duction of the Reforms Scheme interest in the welfare of cattle and horses will bo stimulated throughout the Province and in particular among the members of the District Boards and, municipalities on whose co-operation the successful administration of the Department so largely depends.

[Maximum Limit2 candidate who has not passed the Matriculation examination will be sent up for training. Of the ten boys who joined, seven were Hindus, two Mohammedans and one Christian; according to nationality, seven were Biharis and three domiciled Bengalis ; eight boys received stipends from local bodies and one from the Gangpur State in Orissa. The number of Government stipends remained the same, i.e., six only, of which five were held by Chota Nagpuris and one by an Oriya in different classes. Three third-year students have obtained their diplomas and will be given appointments in due course. The following table shows the results of the annual examination of the Students from this Province:3 Anthrax, Surra and Dourine.4 figure 54,913 includes 4,131 animals modulated by the Ranchi Inoculators. This scheme has since been abolished. As already remarked, the year was characterized by several protracted outbreaks of rinderpest at each of which a large number of inoculations were performed. For instance, 15,814 cattle were inoculated in the outbreak of Manbhum alone; similarly, 7,037 were done in Champaran, 6,366 in Gaya, 5,733 in Bhagalpur, 4,561 in Shahabad, 4,385 in the Santal Parganas and 3,610 in Palamau. The outbreak in the last named district was not finished during the year and hence the total number of inocu- lations for that district could not be shown. Rinderpest.5 TABLE IV. On the 1st April, 1920, there were sixty-five itinerant veterinary assist- ants on the roll. Eight new graduates joined the Department making the total number seventy-three as shown in Table VII. Out of these, two assistants died, one assistant was dismissed, one was appointed stationary-veterinary assistant and one was made officiating Inspector, leaving a total of sixty-eight assistants at the close of the year. Forty-six thousand, nine hundred and eighty fresh cases including castra- tions were treated by the veterinary assistants on tour, as compared with 74,508 cases in the year 1919-20 which shows a total decrease of 27,528 cases. This was due to a larger number of animals having been attacked with and treated for foot and mouth disease during the previous year. The itinerant veterinary assistants visited 19, 648 villages against 18,045 during the year 1919-20. One itinerant assistant was appointed to the new post created at Dham- daha for the Sadr Subdivision of Purnea, while two additional posts, one for Barahpore in the Buxar Subdivision and the other for Jamshedpur in district Singhbhum were sanctioned during the year. TABLE V. There was no change in the number of veterinary hospitals, the same twenty-four hospitals having continued as in the previous year. A post of stationary veterinary assistant was, however, sanctioned for Hazaribagh and the itinerant assistant already employed there was classed stationary. There were, therefore, four hospitals, viz., Dumka, Ranchi, Palamau and Begusarai, in place of five, that remained in charge of itinerant veterinary assistants. The hospital at Dumraon continued to be vacant as the Raj did not apply for a substitute. The rebuilding of the hospital at Bankipur was not taken in hand as expected. Some minor alterations to the plans were carried out and an addi- tional grant of Rs. 2,000 was voted by the District Board, the total amount available for expenditure during the year being Rs. 10,000 only. For better management, the Patna City Municipality agreed to hand over the hospital to the District Board, Patna. The proposal was accepted by the latter local body, The proposals for the construction of a hospital each at Puri and Khurda did not advance further as the District Board, Puri, was unable to meet the cost, A lump contribution of Rs. 20,000 was sanctioned by Government towards meeting the cost of construction of the proposed veterinary hospitals at Chai- bassa and Dumka but the provision was subsequently witheld till next year. As regards the construction of the Ranchi veterinary hospital, the District Board was unable to allot funds over and above the amount of sale proceeds of the present buildings and also the site on which they now stand. It is proposed to approach Government for a grant for this hospital. Of the other hospitals and dispensaries of which a list was given in the annual report of the previous year, considerable progress was made for those at Madhubani and Samastipur in Darbhanga, at Bettiah in Champaran and at Dhanbad in Manbhum, and it is expected they will soon be ready for occupation. The District Board, Purnea, proposed to take up the construction of two hospitals at Kishanganj, and Katihar and applied for financial assistance from Government but as no grant was available, the proposal was dropped for the time being. Preliminary arrangements for the construction of the buildings at Dina- pore, Barh and Bihar were completed during the year and it is hoped they will be put in hand without further delay. The proposals for the hospitals at Bagaha (Champaran) ; Hajipur ; Dhamdaha and Forbesganj (Purnea) ; Buxar and Barahpore (Shahabad) and Purulia have not yet advanced beyond the selection of sites or the preparation of the plans and estimates. Twenty six thousand nine-hundred and fifty fresh patients were treated at the hospitals against 31,531 in 1919-20 ; this shows a decrease of 4,581 cases under " out patients ". In addition to the above number, 652 castrations were performed and 5,948 cases were supplied with medicines but not brought to hospitals.
6 TABLE VIII. BREEDING OPERATIONS. The cattle-breeding scheme in Shabahad District met with further success during the year. At the show which was held in this connexion at Niazipur, 579 animals including 14 District Board hulls were exhibited and prizes amounting to Rs. 402 were distributed to the owners. A sum of Rs. 228 was also Paid to the keepers of the bulls. An interesting feature of the show was that fifteen calves being the progeny of the stud bulls were present. These animals showed a distinct improvement in their bones and conformation. The number of the stud bulls increased from eleven to twenty-two during the year. Table VIII shows the number of stud bulls maintained in the districts. TABLE IX BULL BREEDING FARMS. The Bettiah Raj Farm.7 The cost of maintenance of the herd including the salary of the Superin- tendent amounted to Rs. 49,501 against Rs. 48,492 during the year 1919-20. The total receipts from sale of animals and produce, etc., amounted to Rs. 10,810. TABLES X, XI & XII. (Blank.) TABLES XIII & XIV. The particulars of the principal fairs and shows are given in the above tables. I visited the Sonepur, Khagra, Bihta and Barahpore fairs; at Sonepur I helped in the purchase of five elephants required for the Nanpara and Piag- pur Wards Estates in the United Provinces. Mr. Quinlan and Deputy Superintendent, Babu P. N. Das, were present at the Niazipur show which proved a greater success than in the previous year. The other fairs and shows were attended by the Circle Inspectors or Veteri- nary Assistants as usual. Altogether 11,040 animals were booked by the Bengal and Nortn-Western Railway to the eastern provinces as compared with 20,448 in 1919-20. PROVINCIAL ESTABLISHMENT. The Provincial Veterinary Service was reorganized with the result that the salary attached to it was increased from Rs. 200-10-350 to Rs. 200 (for proba- tioners)8 and was granted leave for two months from the 22nd February, 1921. Two more veterinary assistants, Babus N. Chattarji and S. Chakravarty, were appointed sub. pro tem, inspectors and held charge of the Patna and Chaibassa Circles, respectively, Veterinary assistant. Babu R. K. Ram, was appointed Staff Veterinary Assistant but was attached to the office. Another assistant, Maulavi S. R. Hasan, a graduate of the Punjab Veterinary College, was given the post of a Staff Veterinary Assistant in consideration of the satisfac- tory record of his services under the Military Department. Altogether 92 veterinary assistants, including the one under the Bettiah Raj, were employed during the year. Of these, three assistants as noted above were promoted to the Inspector's grade, one viz., Babu J. L. Bose, was on deputation as Khedda Officer, Angul, one (Babu M. M. Banarji) was excluded from the list as being under the Agricultural Department, three were dismissed and two died. There were accordingly eighty-one veterinary assistants on the roll at the end of the year. The strength of the total subordinate staff employed is shown in table VII. The names of the following officers are specially mentioned for good work :TABLE II. Showing number of deaths from contagious diseases amongst animals during the year 1920-21. District. Equines.

The Department performed 92,030 inoculations against epidemic diseases as compared with 54,913 in the previous year. This is satisfactory evidence that the increased severity of the attacks was met by increased activity. Government note with special interest the successful application of the method known as " serum simultaneous" inoculation to the Pusa and Kanke herds. This method is believed to confer permanent immunity against rinderpest, avoiding the necessity, which the ordinary method entails, of repeating the inoculations at fairly frequent intervals. Captain Riley, under whose personal supervision the experiments were made, is to be congratulated on their success, especially as it is understood that the method has not been tried on a large scale hitherto in India. 5. The subject of cattle-breeding is one which must engage the early attention of the Advisory Board. The two farms at Sipaya and Bettiah have done useful pioneer work, but clearly cannot by themselves effect any substan- tial improvement in view of the vast cattle population of the province. It is satisfactory, however, to notice that the progeny of the stud bulls supplied from Sipaya to the Shahabad District Board show a distinct improvement over the ordinary young stock of the district. 6. Government acknowledge the valuable services rendered by local bodies in connection with veterinary work, especially in the matter of building hospitals and dispensaries. Money has been provided in the present year's- budget to assist local bodies to build hospitals at Patna, Dumka and Chaibassa. Government also acknowledge the services of Mr. Quinlan, who has held charge of the department since the creation of the province and to whom the credit of the increasing recognition of its utility by the public is largely due. They also note with satisfaction the commendation of the officers mentioned for good work by the Veterinary Adviser and thank Captain Riley for his interest- ing report. ORDER.
