Veterinary Dispensaries ...................................... 1ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BENGAL, For the year 1902-1903. 1. The work of the department made steady progress during the year. Two new dispensaries were opened in Ranchi and Palamau with a Veterinary Assistant in charge of each, and seven more itinerant Veterinary Assistants were appointed, one in each of the districts of Bankura, Rajshahi, Jalpaiguri, Mymensingh and Pabna, and two in Backergunge. Veterinary Assistants were also required in Bhagalpur, Noakhali, Khurda, Dumka and Angul, but could not be supplied during the year for want of men. Table XXIV shows that the strength of the subordinate veterinary staff employed during the year was 43 against 34 during last year. 2. The number of in-patients treated in the dispensaries was 903, as compared with 737 last year. Twenty-four thousand nine hundred and eleven (24,911) cases were treated as out-patients against 8,892 in 1901-1902. The number of cases treated by the itinerating Veterinary Assistants in the villages was 21,439 in 1902-1903 against 7,346 in 1901-1902. VETERINARY DISPENSARIES. 3. Table XIX shows details regarding each dispensary. All the Pro- vincial Veterinary Dispensaries, except two, were inspected by me at least once and were repeatedly visited and reported on by the Inspectors. I was unable to get to Daltonganj, and Sitamarhi, owing to the disastrous floods at the time of my tour in that neighbourhood, could not he inspected. 4. Sitamarhi.( 2 ) 8. Muzaffarpur.( 3 ) Veterinary Assistant. He performed post-mortem examinations and examined animals seized under the Cruelty Act. Fifty-four operations were performed by him with good results. The Veterinary Assistant, on the whole, did his work satisfactorily. 16. Tippera.( 4 ) The chief work of the Veterinary Assistant is of an itinerant nature. He inspects all the Raj villages in rotation, both with a view to treat ordinary cases and especially to deal with outbreaks of infectious diseases. 22. .Palamau.( 5 ) There was no friction nor misunderstanding of any kind between the operators and the owners. CATTLE PAIRS AND SHOWS. 32. I attended the Sonepore, Barrahpur and Suri fairs, and the Assistant Superintendent attended the Sitamarhi fair. No one from this Department could visit the Kalimpong fair, as all my staff was engaged at the time. The allotment of Rs. 250 for mule-stock at Kalimpong, which, I recommended, should not be given any more, as it had served its purpose, was discontinued by the Inspector-General, Civil Veterinary Department. CATTLE BREEDING. 33. The Inspector-General of the Civil Veterinary Department and the Inspector-General of Agriculture in India have visited Bengal and made certain recommendations about cattle breeding, which, no doubt, will be carried out when the money is available and the necessary orders have been passed. HORSE AND PONY BREEDING. 34. Hathwa. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE BENGAL VETERINARY COLLEGE For the year 1902-1903. THE STUDENTS. 1. Class A.( 8 ) 1,171 and 787, respectively, in 1901-1902 (Appendix A). Though there is a decrease in the total number of in-patients, the horse and cattle patients were practically double the number of the previous year (1,014 against 526, which was due to increased popularity of the infirmary with the poorer people owing to the reduction of fees. In previous years, when there were no fees charged for the treatment of dogs, sheep and goats, the in-and-out-patients were regis- tered together and shown under the heading of free in-patients, but since it has been ruled that they should be charged for, they have been shown as either in- or out-patients according to the department in which they were treated to facilitate accounts. Hence the apparent decrease of in-patients. Had all the dogs, sheep, and goats been shown under in-patients as in previous years, the total number of in-patients would have been 1,582 in- stead of 1,052. The percentage of deaths was 5.53 against 3.21 last year. The higher mortality was chiefly owing to a larger number of rinder- pest cases having been admitted this year (viz., 90 admissions and 54 deaths against 1 admission and 1 death). Six hundred and twenty-three operations were performed against 473 last year. The number of horses shod at the forge was 336 in 1902-1903 against 433 of the previous year. No animals were received from the Dum-Dum Cantonment since the reduction of the garrison. This explains the decrease under this head. 9. The accommodation in the hospital having been found insufficient for the number of patients, Sir John Woodburn, a few days before his death, sanctioned, on the recommendation of the Hon'ble Mr. W. C. Macpherson, a special grant of Rs. 29,765 for sheds, hospital necessaries, food and servants. The additional accommodation will be for 150 head of cattle. A special operating theatre will be constructed, and a suitable water-supply will be laid on. The new buildings are under construction in the Annexe. This Annexe has hitherto been held on a 15-year lease, but steps are being taken to acquire it. FINANCIAL. 10. The fees for the treatment, shoeing, &c., amount to Rs. 8,890-12-4 against Rs. 11,621-12-9 in 1901-1902. They would have amounted to Rs. 8,957-2-4, had the fees for Government animals been charged. The cost of feeding the patients was Rs. 15,636-15-2, against Rs. 7,889-8-8 in 1901-1902. The decrease in fees and the increase in cost of feeding was owing to a larger number of animals (chiefly horses and cattle) being admitted at lower rates. 11. The statement showing the Provincial cost of the department is appended (Table XVIII). OUTSTANDING ACCOUNTS. 12. Of the sum of Rs. 54-14 shown in the reports of the two preceding years as due from two old defaulters, Rs. 15 were realised during the year, and. the balance, Rs. 39-14, being irrecoverable, has been written off with the sanction of Government. The fees due for the year under report amount to Rs. 150-2-0. But, as more than half this amount is due from the Calcutta and Cossipore-Chitpur Municipalities, the outstanding amount is expected to be shortly recovered. THE HOSTEL. 13. All the students lived in the hostel and their general health was good. INSTRUCTION TO OTHERS THAN VETERINARY STUDENTS. 14. The usual course of lectures on Veterinary hygiene and Cattle Breeding and Rearing was delivered to six students of the Agricultural class of the Civil Engineering College. 15. Twenty-nine petty officers and drivers of the Supply and Transport Corps were instructed in nursing sick animals. These men did well, TEACHING STAFF. 16. I have recommended, and Government has sanctioned, a well-deserved increment of pay to Mr. E. Burke, Assistant Principal, which will take effect from 1st April 1903. One of the lecturers, Mr. Charles Engel, resigned his appointment in September, and was replaced by the promotion of Mr. D. K. Dey, who was 3rd Lecturer. Mr. S. K. Mitter, who was 1st Veterinary Inspector, was promoted to 3rd Lectureship, on probation. The results of the examina- tions indicate that these changes have been beneficial to the College.
