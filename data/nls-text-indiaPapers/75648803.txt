Karachi, dated 27th August 1942. Forwarded with compliments to the Secretary to the Government of Sind, General Department. 2. Mr. J. H. G. Jerrom, M.R.C.V.S., I.V.S., who held this charge for about 21 years proceeded on leave preparatory to retirement on the 20th January 1942 and was succeeded by Mr. Bachan Singh, M.R.C.V.S. 3. The total mortality from contagious, infectious and parasitic diseases was 6,365 as against 6,637 in the previous year. On the whole the year has been fairly healthy for the live stock. 4. In accordance with the programme sanctioned by Government 2 more Itinerating Veterinary Dispensaries were opened, one at Badin in Hyderabad District and the other one at Moro in the Nawabshah District during the year. The District Local Board, Thar Parkar, and The District Local Board, Larkana, also opened two and one veterinary dispensaries, respectively. Altogether the department now has 32 veterinary dispensaries in the province. The number of cases treated at these dispensaries was 43,572 as against 41,645 in 1940-41. The number of castrations performed at dispensaries during the year under report was 5,250 as compared with 4,631 in the preceding year. 5. The work done by the district staff on tour consisted of treatment of 70,448 cases for Contagious, infectious and parasitic diseases, 7,200 for non-contagious diseases and castration of 2,428 performed in 2,635 villages as compared with 69,145 cases for contagious, infectious and parasitic diseases and 5,790 cases of non-contagious diseases treated and 1,684 castrations performed in 2,334 villages in the previous year. From the above it may be seen that the activities of the department in its various aspects were well maintained. 6. The District Local Board, Upper Sind Frontier, held their Horse Show at Jacobabad as usual and Government contributed Rs. 500 and a L (IV)18252 silver medal and a cash contribution of Rs. 500 was also made by the Karachi Race and Riding Club, Limited. 7. Partly owing to abnormal conditions and partly due to financial stringency it has not been possible to increase the number of stallions during the year under report with the result that the position as regards horse breeding remains unsatisfactory, there being only 2 stallions in the province. The total expenditure of the Department during the year under report was Rs. 1,65,134 as against Rs. 1,53,041 in the previous year. BACHAN SINGH, Karachi, 27th August 1942.

The Goat Tissue Virus required for immunising cattle and buffaloes against Rinderpest was prepared locally at the Goat Virus Producing Station, Karachi, and 68,700 doses of tissue virus were issued to the district staff to control outbreaks of the disease. The potency of the virus was ensured by obtaining fresh brew of virus at regular intervals from the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar, and passing it in goats locally.

The post of Veterinary Inspector was held by Mr. M. W. Mirza from 1st July 1941 to 10th July 1941 and from 14th to 31st March 1942 and by Mr. J. R.

He inspected all the veterinary dispensaries, visited also the Agricultural Farms and Pinjrapoles. 56. Eight Veterinary Field Compounders continued to work in the department. Of these three were temporarily placed in charge of Itinerating Veterinary Dispensaries and 5 worked under Veterinary Assistant Surgeons. They attended outbreaks of Liver Fluke, Parasitic gastritis, Foot-and-Mouth disease, Mange and treated other simple cases. They also carried out castra- tions of bulls by Burdizzo method. The work done by these men has on experience proved to be very beneficial in the rural areas. Three Veterinary Compounders maintained by the District Local Board and placed in charge of dispensaries in Thar Parkar district are also included in Table X. 57. The office establishment in spite of presure of work due to the expansion of the department under the supervision of the Head Clerk who is due for retirement in the beginning of 1943 has performed their duties most satisfactorily. V.10 63. Sind depends upon Agriculture as its main source of livelihood and Agriculturists are entirely dependent upon their live stock. Obviously, there- fore, the importance of cattle wealth can hardly be exaggerated. To eradicate the various contagious and parasitic diseases which cause a great deal of mortality and degeneration in live stock every year, the need for having an efficient veterinary organisation, viz., providing veterinary aid at each taluka cannot be over emphasised. 64. Greater facilities than are available at present for conducting research and laboratory work with a view to deal with the control of disease more efficiently and promptly are urgently required. 65. To cope with the office work due to the expansion of the depart- ment the present clerical staff is inadequate, an increase in this cadre is absolutely necessary. 66. It is gratifying to note that the Government has recently passed orders for the introduction of Cattle Disease Act which will be brought into effect shortly and it is hoped by systematic application the measure will prove effective in checking the incidence of some of the serious type of contagious diseases of cattle and thus prove beneficial to live stock owners in the province. 67. Before concluding this report the Director on behalf of the staff desires to express gratitude to Mr. J. H. G. Jerrom, M.R.C.V.S., I.V.S., who proceeded on leave preparatory to retirement from the 20th January 1942 for his kind and sympathetic treatment and efficient administration of the Depart- ment for a long period of 21 years.
