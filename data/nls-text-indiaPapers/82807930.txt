OFFICE OF SURGEON-GENERAL, I.M.D., FORT ST. GEORGE, 18th June 1878. No. 339. From SURGEON-GENERAL GEORGE SMITH, M.D., Indian Medical Department, Fort St. George, To THE HONORABLE D. F. CAKMICHAEL, Chief Secretary to Government, Judicial Department, Fort St. George. SIR, I HAVE the honor to forward, for submission to His Grace the Governor in Council, the Annual Report on the Lunatic Asylums of this Presidency for 1877-78. 2. During the year under review the health state of this Presidency has been unsatisfactory. There have been scarcity of food, prolonged drought and widespread disease, and these unfavorable influences, though less distinctly marked than in the preceding year, have left indications of their operation in the disease and mortality returns of the asylums. 3. The following table gives the general facts in connection with recoveries and mortality, and contrasts these with the corresponding data of the preceding year, the result being favorable as regards the percentage of recoveries but unfavorable as regards the rate of mortality:4 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. under review, there having been 23 admissions with a total treated of 115 and a remainder of 64 as against the corresponding totals of 44, 125, and 92 of the immediately preceding year. The number discharged during 1877-78 was consider- ably in excess of that of 1876-77, as was also the aggregate of mortality, 26 deaths having taken place during the year. The second table distributes among the three asylums the aggregates recorded in the first table. The excess of mortality, it will be seen, is confined to the Madras Lunatic Asylum, the mortality in the Vizagapatam Asylum being the same as and that of the Calicut Asylum being one less than that of the corresponding returns of the preceding year. Table No. II in the Appendix records the experiences of the year under review as well as of the preceding ten years. The daily average strength of the last three years shows that some special arrangements for the accommodation of criminal insanes will soon become necessary. Years. Admissions. Total Treated.

The Superintendent has been successful in introducing useful and remunerative occupations among the inmates of the asylum; such occupations are remedial agents of great value and, from an economical point of view, are of considerable pecuniary importance to Government. In future the bedding as well as the clothing of the asylum will be made by the inmates. Dr. Nanney's efforts in this direction are most praiseworthy. The system followed of opening the asylum at proper times to the inspection of the public is one calculated to secure public confidence in the working of the institution and to dispel erroneous ideas touching the treatment to which the afflicted inmates are subjected. The attention of Government is solicited to the 12th paragraph of the Superintendent's report. The condition of the grounds is most satisfactory; cleanliness, neatness and order are visible everywhere. Economies have been effected in the cost of bedding and clothing and a much needed reorganization has been introduced without increasing much the total expenditure. Dr. Nanney speaks highly of his subordinate staff. 15. Vizagapatam Lunatic Asylum.ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 11 Rupees 8 to 10 were asked per head by parties willing to board harmless insanes. The question merits further consideration. Dr. Smith speaks highly of Mr. Apothe- ary Morris but with reserve of his warders. 16. Calicut Lunatic Asylum.12 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. The total increase of expenditure in 1877-78 over that of 1876-77 was Rupees 818-11-1. The increase took place chiefly in the items of pay of establish- ment, diets including wines, perishable articles, contingencies and European medicines. On the other hand there was a marked reduction in the expenditure under the heads of bedding and clothing. The following table shows the average cost of maintenance per patient in each of the three asylums for the last two years :ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 13 ANNUAL MEDICAL REPORT OF THE LUNATIC ASYLUM, MADRAS, FOR THE YEAR 1877-78.

The two cottages for superior patients have been handed over to me and suitably furnished and are now occupied, proving most useful for the accommo- dation of patients of a better class. No new buildings have been erected owing to want of funds caused by the heavy expenditure connected with the famine. Government have been pleased to sanction an upper story to the Superintendent's quarters, which, it is hoped, will be erected as early as possible after the commencement of the official year. This is much needed for the protection of the family of the Superintendent, who have at present no place of security in the event of dangerous patients escaping from their wards. The hot season is the time when this class of patients are usually admitted. The want of a latrine for the servants of the medical and other subordinates is much felt, and one could be erected on open ground beyond the dead-house, where it could be daily inspected, and in that position would not prove a nuisance to any one and could be used by the asylum servants generally. This is a measure that should be adopted for the better sanitary condition of that portion of the grounds which at present are only kept in order by constant vigilance. Some extra godowns and a cook-room are also needed by the subordinates and head European attendants. The subject of the drain, gates in the cook-room, and female enclosure have been specially brought to notice and will shortly be attended to. The gloomy appearance of the block of 9 and 12 rooms to which I alluded in my last annual report, caused by the walls being tarred to a considerable height, might be obviated by removing the tar and substituting a coat of paint, which has proved successful in the criminal enclosure. I am still of opinion, however, that glazed tiles, as recommended by me last year, would prove more lasting, cheerful, and cleanly. Two permanent wells have been constructed, one in the criminal enclosure and the other near the Superintendent's quarters ; both yield a liberal supply of good water, there being a stratum of potable water along that portion of the grounds. The two other wells sanctioned during the water-famine were abandoned on the setting in of the monsoon and the temporary pot-wells filled in. 4
14 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 3. The general condition of the asylum and its inmates is satisfactory, although from the high death-rate it might not appear so. This, however, must be referred to causes which I will detail fully under the heading of mortality. On the other hand, the very large percentage of cures, which exceeds by nearly one- half the highest on record, may be looked upon as fully compensating for the apparently high death-rate; and out of these, 2 were Europeans of a better class whose cases on admission gave very little grounds for hope. No epidemic of any kind has visited the asylum, although small-pox, cholera, typhoid and fevers of a low type generally have been prevalent in the Town of Madras. Here there has not been a single case of any of the above. No accidents of a serious nature have occurred, no suicides or homicides have taken place. The criminals have been quiet and well behaved, which I attribute to the constant and interesting employ- ments provided for them in weaving, spinning, and gardening operations. There have been four escapes, of whom one only was recaptured; all were harmless, quiet lunatics, and therefore evaded the vigilance of the warders, whose attention is more specially directed to the troublesome and dangerous patients. No criminals effected their escape. To obviate the wandering away of the inmates, the aloe fence surrounding the asylum is being repaired and the trench deepened, as the cost of a wall, which would alone effectually prevent escapes, is found too heavy. 4. The number of patients remaining under treatment on the 31st March 1878 was 223, the numbers on the same dates in 1877, 1876, and 1875 having been respectively, 276, 244, and 243. It is observable that the population which steadily increased from year to year has this season shown a decided diminution owing in part probably to the large number of poor creatures swept away by famine and disease, amongst whom those bereft of reason would be likely to succumb early, and also to the large mortality amongst chronic cases, by which the resident population is mainly increased, 42 of the deaths having occurred amongst cases of over one year residence in the asylum. The admissions also have been less numerous, doubtless owing to the first-mentioned cause. 5. The number of new admissions amounts to 110, of which only one was a re-admission. Of theseANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 15 disorders. Even where intemperance is the proximate cause, it is in many cases a atal inheritance where it assumes the form of dipsomania ; " this disease being nearly every case inherited from some insane progenitor, possibly so remote that he has been forgotten "16 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS.

My special attention was early attracted to it and increased care bestowed on the patients, but without any sensible decrease in the number of deaths. It thus became evident that the cause must lie outside the influences of the asylum and be connected with influences which caused such terrible mortatily throughout the land. Out of the 8 recorded as health on admission " good," one was a man put down " good," through an oversight during my absence, who should have been recorded as " bad " as he was a confirmed epileptic and had violent and frequent seizures of a severe charac- ter which ultimately proved fatal. A second, who was reported on admission to be subject to epileptic fits occasionally, was put down as " good." She was a congenital idiot, and it is probable that she had always been subject to these fits, which, on admission, were not so frequent or of so severe a kind as they became ultimately, one of which proved fatal. She was an inmate for four years and one month. Three more whose health was " good " on admission, lived over six years and died of atrophy and dysentery, and the remaining three succumbed to atrophy after three and two years' residence. Of the 16 whose health on admission was " fair," no less than 10 died of atrophy, a state so closely connected with the diseased condi- tion of the nervous system that it may almost be regarded as the physical sign of the inward mental decay. Of the 66 deaths recorded this year, no less than 38 were from atrophy and 3 more from the closely allied general debility; and of 10 others attributed to diarrhANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 17 One death occurred this year of a patient18 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. principle to the Madras Asylum, as proposed by the Surgeon-General in last year's report, meets with one great difficulty, viz., in finding suitable surroundings and trustworthy persons to whom could be committed so responsible a charge. The native character is in many points so unreliable that it would be difficult to confide to them poor creatures who would be incapable of complaining. Doubtless, could suitable homes be found for them, the results would be most satisfactory; but the chief defect in asylums in England which renders the boarding-out system so desirable there, is their large size and prison-like aspect, overcrowding and accu- mulation of so many insanes together. These drawbacks do not exist here, where the appearance of the grounds with their detached cottages is that of a village, and more cheerful and healthy than any localities occupied by persons in the same class of life. The warders work with the patients, and their friends visit them weekly. Under such circumstances the boarding-out system might be tried as an experiment to be resorted to should the asylum ever become over-populated. Nearly allied to this subject is the occasional mingling of the two sexes, which, from its associations with home life, proves valuable and beneficial. Although the women's quarters are separated from the rest of the asylum by a low wall, and during the busy hours of the day they are necessarily apart, they occasionally, when the band plays, meet and dance and converse together, which seems to cheer and please them. Visitors also take great interest in them, and it is much to be wished that the opportunities of social gathering could be yet more frequent. I have even more reason to speak favorably of the morning and evening exercise to which I alluded on former occasions as productive of marked benefit. The long walks round the extensive grounds of the asylum in which all patients not actively employed throughout the day are induced to join tend to improve their bodily health, work off their superfluous energies, and prepare them for the night's repose; in fact it proves one of the best hypnotics as well as a most healthy and innocuous one. I may instance the case of one who formerly loitered about and was on several occasions very violent and always an uncertain and troublesome patient. Since, by my order, he accompanied the others in their walks, he has become quiet, tranquil, and well behaved. I could give many examples, but will only instance one other, a State prisoner, who was formerly very abusive and at times violent, has improved consid- erably. In many cases of insomnia a little wine or arrack at bed time induces quiet sleep, and I do not consider the use of opiates desirable where simple means can be employed to effect the desired result. Lastly, I may mention what is called the humouring method of treatment which some condemn as calculated to feed the original delusion. Such has not been my experience here, although it is a method of treatment requiring tact and personal observation of the individual case. As a rule, to avoid opposition to delusion or caprice without by undue encouragement, fostering abnormal ideas produces most happy results, and in any case the kinder course may first be tried and greater firmness exercised when the necessity becomes apparent. 10. I have much satisfaction in detailing the valuable results, first to the patients, and secondly to the institution of the various occupations which have been introduced. These have proved not only remedial agents of great importance but also, in the economy of the establishment, have effected a reform in the quality and cost of the clothing. The weaving, carried on last season as an experiment, has this year, on the recommendation of the Surgeon-General (who fully supported my views on the subject of occupation and kindly obtained the sanction of Govern- ment), been employed for the manufacture, first, of a portion of the clothing, and now for both the clothing and bedding of the institution. Four English looms are at work turning out on an average ten yards a day, making a total of 3,691 yards, during the year, of excellent material. The cotton being supplied on indent by Government, the cost of the clothing is greatly reduced, while at the same time the quality is vastly improved. The cloth when woven is carefully cut out by one of the tailors and sewn by the women aided by the other tailor with the sewing-machine. Some are employed in spinning the cotton, preparing the thread, starching and arranging it upon the loom. Of the weavers, one learnt it at Trichinopoly Jail before he became insane, the others have acquired it
ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 19 since they came here. From the time that the weaving operations have been thorough- ly established I have observed a marked improvement in the behaviour of the crimi- nal patients by whom the chief portion of this work is carried on. The looms are erected in the criminal enclosure as offering greater security for the thread and various appliances. The sewing-machine and the tailoring are under the care of the matron, and a great deal of good needle-work is done by the women, who also mark the blankets and cumblies. For the security of the other clothing, to prevent theft, three longitudinal blue lines are woven into every piece of cloth. Thus any clothing abstracted could be at once identified. It is in addition stamped with the asylum mark, and the loss of clothing since the introduction of this system and the reorganisation of the Steward's Department has been almost nil. The next branch of industry is the gardening, which affords much useful and healthy occupa- tion ; it has not realized much profit this year owing to the bad season, but the young fruit trees planted last year have been kept alive in spite of the drought, and are healthy and flourishing, and additions have been made this season which promise well, and in the course of a few years some very handsome avenues of graft mangoes, asokas, and casuarinas will adorn the asylum grounds and afford much shade and protection. Further occupation is found in sweeping and cleaning the extensive grounds, cutting the roads and hedges, drawing water, pounding and sifting earth for conservancy purposes; some patients help at the cook-room and assist in carrying round the food and in general work about the cottages and wards. Some very good rope was also made, and this branch of industry could be usefully developed if it might be manufactured here for the use of the institution instead of obtaining it, as at present, from the Penitentiary. I am glad to say that this season some of the idiots have been induced to assist in watering the young trees, who hitherto did little or nothing. 11. Recreation.20 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS.

The greater portion of this saving has been effected in the clothing and bedding, in which items of expenditure a decrease of Rupees 3,131-5-0 is shown. A portion of this is apparent only, the thread which is now used in the manufacture of the cloth in the asylum coming under the head of contingencies. This amounts to Rupees 508-6-8, leaving a clear saving in the clothing and bedding of Rupees 2,622-14-4. Comparing the expenditure under this heading with the year 1873-74, at the lose of which I took charge of the asylum, I am able to show the following mazing difference:22 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. Messrs. Morris and Bruce, conduct the duties of their trying post in a creditable manner. Mr. Bruce was appointed in November last in lieu of Mr. Coyne, who resigned in order to take up the more lucrative post of Jailor at Cuddapah. He is a steady, well-behaved man, and will, I trust, as he gains more experience, prove a good and trustworthy attendant. The two 1st-Class East Indian Keepers, Berryman and Muriel, work exceedingly well. To Mr. Berryman is entrusted the care of the criminal enclosure. He was appointed in February last vice Bruce promoted to Head European Attendant. So far he has done well and is kind and attentive to the patients and takes great interest in the weaving. His pay of Rupees 15 per mensem is a sum wholly inade- quate to induce any good man to come forward; and Berryman, like Bruce, is only holding it until something better turns up. It is to be regretted that so important a post is only made a stepping-stone of and taken as a temporary measure; and no fewer than three men accepted the berth for a time and resigned owing to the nature of the work and the small salary. I trust that Government may take the circumstances of the case into their very favorable consideration and increase the pay of the Sergeant in charge of the Criminal Jail from Rupees 15 to Rupees 30, considering the satisfactory manner in which the weaving is progressing and the large saving that is now being effected by the manufacture of excellent bedding and clothing. The Steward's Department is working satisfactorily, and the bedding and clothing kept in a much better condition than hitherto. The system of book-keeping in connection with this department, introduced by the Surgeon-General, answers admirably, and no difficulty is experienced in working it. The night watchmen work fairly well. They require constant supervision. The native warders are, on the whole, a very indifferent set of men. A few work well, but I am sorry to say very little reliance can be placed in them generally. They require constant looking after. Three of them are weavers by trade. One is a brick-layer and several are experienced gardeners. The official visitors have regularly inspected the asylum monthly. Vaccination has been satisfactorily carried on. I certify that the orders respecting the custody of poisonous drugs issued by the Principal Inspector-General, Indian Medical Department, dated 23rd January 1863, are carefully carried out.

Of the 63 cases that were treated, 7 were discharged, viz., 5 males and 2 females; 1 male criminal lunatic was transferred to the Madras Asylum; 8 died, viz., 7 males and 1 female; and there are now 47 cases under treatment. Admissions.24 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. One birth occurred during the year; the mother, an insane named Nuki, was admitted into the asylum on the 20th November 1874 and was found to be pregnant on the 17th July 1877. Searching inquiry was at once instituted regarding the paternity by the Assistant Magistrate and subsequently by the official visitors, Deputy Surgeon-General, District Judge, and District Magistrate, but nothing was discovered regarding it. After the woman had become enceinte her mental condition improved rapidly, and she was discharged cured on the 19th January 1878, two months after the birth of her child. The female cottage is enclosed by a henna hedge which practically is no fence at all as it is full of gaps. The official visitors are of opinion that the females should be removed into the criminal enclosure, the male criminals being transferred elsewhere. The insanes are occupied morning and evening in watering the young trees, of which there are a great number, clearing the grounds of weeds, litter and decayed leaves, and drawing water; but during the day they amuse themselves with musical instruments, singing, &c. Occupation and recreation with good diet and kind treatment are the means used for promoting recovery; I have noticed that those insanes who work cheerfully and willingly keep the best health. All the deaths, without exception, occurred among the non-working insanes. I am glad to report that a decided improvement has taken place in the habits of the patients. Those of really filthy habits are now very few in number. The cottage for these patients is now rarely in the filthy state it used to be. Owing to the unusual lack of rain farming operations were not attempted, but sheep-farming on a small scale was tried for five months when there was sufficient pasture, and the amount realised by the sale of stock was very encouraging. An attempt is being made to lay down the grounds in " hurrialli" grass, but the past year has been very unfavorable for such operations. One insane effected his escape and was recaptured at his village. This man had only been admitted three days previously; he removed the temporary fastenings from the shattered door of his cottage at night, and through the opening thus effected he made his exit. All the doors and windows which were damaged by the cyclone of October 1876 are now in process of repair and will most probably be completed in a short time. No epidemic prevailed, though two villages (Chinna Waltair and Pedda Waltair), distant a few hundreds of yards from the asylum, suffered severely from cholera. The inmates of the asylum enjoyed perfect immunity from the disease; the sanitation of the premises is strictly attended to always, but during the prevalence of cholera in the vicinity sulphur fumigation is carried out daily. Last year there remained on hand the sum of Rupees 40-8-4 from the Garden Fund; 43 sheep were purchased for Rupees 36-10-6; 34 sheep were sold for Rupees 52-15-0. By sale of garden produce the sum of Rupees 19-3-7 was realised, and there now remains on hand the sum of Rupees 72-12-3. The sum of Rupees 3-4-2 was paid as hire for cutting palmyra leaves. The cost of maintaining an insane during 1877-78 in this asylum has been on on average Rupees 13-14-11 per mensem. The supplier had his diet rates raised, owing to scarcity, from Annas 1-10 per full diet to Annas 3 per full diet, and from Annas 1-7 per reduced diet to Annas 2-3 per reduced diet from the 1st October 1877 under Order of Government, No. 2,232, of 18th September 1877. The cost of diets is recovered from the treasury, and the " other charges " credited to Government agreeably to Government Order, dated 15th April 1875. Criminal insanes are wholly supported at the cost of Government, but civil insanes by the various Local Fund Boards and Municipalities. A meeting of the official visitors takes place monthly. Mr. Morris, the Apothecary in charge, has given me great satisfaction in the discharge of his duties. The Head Warder is a decent enough man, but he wants firmness of character; is too mild and lacks authority over those under him.

The deaths have been much less than the previous year. The recoveries have been nearly double. 2. The buildings are in a fair state of repair. There have been six rooms in the male enclosure and three in the female erected for violent patients by the Public Works Department. 3. The water-supply is at present very deficient and always is so in the hot weather, which causes great inconvenience ; the patients have to go about 500 yards from the asylum to get water. It would be a great advantage if another well was dug in the compound. The drainage of the asylum is natural. 4. The health of the inmates has been very good. The average daily sick in hospital has been only 1.98. Since the close of last year 35 patients have gained in weight, and 10 lost; there was sufficient cause for those that did lose weight: all but 4 suffered from disease.

Madras .. .. .. .. .. .. 386 Waltair .. .. .. .. .. .. 63 Calicut .. .. .. .. .. .. 64 Total .. 513 The Annual Reports for 1877-78 on the three Lunatic Asylums established at Madras, Waltair, and Calicut show that the number of inmates under treatment at the commencement of the year was 363; that there were 148 admissions and two re-admis- sions during the year, and that the aggregate number treated was 513,* of which 389 were males and 124 females. The number cured and discharged was 97, transferred to friends 16, and otherwise disposed of 5, making in all 118 discharged from the Asylums, besides 80 deaths. The number that remained in the Asylums on the 1st April 1878 was 315; 241 men and 74 females. Compared with the preceding year 1876-77, the admissions were less by 18, and the re-admissions by 4 ; while the cures were greater by 41, and the deaths by 8 ; the latter being due to the general unsatisfactory state of health of the Presidency. 2. The number of criminal lunatics in the three Asylums was 92 at the commence- ment of the year, there were 23 admissions during the year, and the total number under treatment was 115 ; of this number 25 were discharged and 26 died, and there remained at the close of the year 64, or 28 less than the number (92) at the end of 1876-77. The daily average number for the last three years strengthens the opinion expressed by the Surgeon-General last year, that special arrangement for the accom- modation of criminal lunatics will soon become necessary. 3. The classes to which the persons admitted during the year belonged, were44 4. The ages on admission show that the largest number of persons were between 20 to 40, and between 40 and 60. The Surgeon-General is of opinion that the tendency to insanity is most distinctly marked in the third and fourth decennia of life, and is less between the 40th and 60th years of age. 5. The 150 admissions are classed as under:45 1876-77. 1877-78. RS. A. P. RS. A. P.

The average cost of maintenance was, compared with 1876-77, less in the Madras and Vizagapatam Asylums, but increased in the Calicut Asylum, the condition of the inmates there at the beginning of the year rendering an improved scale of diet necessary. The profits realized from work done by the inmates of the Madras Asylum are set down at Rupees 581-9-6, and by those of the Calicut Asylum at Rupees 145-3-9, besides much useful work done in connection with gardens and the conservancy of the grounds.

Chief Secretary to Government, Judicial Department, Fort St. George. SIR, Madras. Vizagapatam. Calicut. I HAVE the honor to submit, to His Grace the Governor in Council, the Annual Report on the three Lunatic Asylums of this Presidency, as marginally noted, for 1878-79. 2. During the year under review public health was still somewhat disturbed by scarcity and dearness of food and unfavorable climatic conditions, and there are distinct evidences of the influence of these unfavorable agencies in the disease and mortality returns of the asylums. 3.

The results of 1878-79 as compared with those of the previous year were therefore less favorable as regards discharges, but they show a reduc- tion in mortality. 8. The subjoined abstract shows the results as regards criminal lunatics in each of the three asylums. With reference to the remaining at the end of 1878-79 the increase was confined to Madras, there having been a diminution in each of the two other institutions. Asylums. Remained. Admitted.

The class of criminal insanes has a growing tendency, although the daily average strength was less in 1878-79 than in the immediately preceding years. The growth of an asylum population is greatly due to the accumulation of incurable cases, and although the numbers remaining at the close of 1877-78 and 1878-79 were less than in some of the preceding years, still no conclusion can be arrived at from this as to the probable increase or decrease of criminal insanes in coming years. A good many cases must of course prove incurable and remain there to die, meanwhile increasing the remaining at the close of each year during their tenure of life. Dr. Mortimer Granville, an authority on lunacy, in England, is inclined to think that the normal life of a case of insanity "so far as residence in an asylum is concerned should be estimated at nearly nine years, when the population studied is a large one and the period surveyed covers three or four decades." 9.

Further details as to the caste and sex of admissions, and also regarding the places from which the patients were sent to asylums will be found in Table III of Appendix. 11. Previous occupations of Insanes.ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 7 recoveries from melancholia, chronic mania and chronic dementia were higher than in 1877-78. Next to puerperal, acute mania shows the largest number of recoveries. The greatest number of recoveries takes place in cases brought under treatment within the first six months of the commencement of the attack. After a year the proportion of recoveries rapidly diminishes. In the management of insanity, there- fore, time is of great importance, the chance of recovery being greatly increased by prompt treatment. A reference to the statement given above shows, that the greater number of recoveries took place amongst acute cases, and that recoveries from chronic mental disease were comparatively few. 14.

No new buildings have been erected during the year. A door has been placed in the female enclosure in lieu of the open gateway; this was much needed, and has proved a source of comfort and security to the inmates. A similar improvement has been made at the cook-room, and wire gauze nailed over the windows, which is of great assistance in the prevention of petty thefts. The water used in cooking is now conveyed by a subterranean channel from the nearest well, and is drawn by a tap within the cook-room. This was suggested by me to save the constant passing in and out of patients and warders carrying water. It was proposed to carry off the refuse water from the neighbourhood of the two wells near the kitchen by means of a drain leading into the main channel. Only a portion of the drain was built, when the work was stopped for want of funds; its completion would add to the sanitary condition of the place. Two patients having effected their escape by climbing upon the top of the latrine in the criminal enclosure, this latrine and the corresponding one in the noisy enclosure have been removed as they were too near the outer wall, and have been rebuilt at a distance of 10 feet from the main wall. The strong cottages for the use of dangerous European insanes, which were sanctioned two years ago, have not yet been commenced; their want is much felt, and during the hot weather there is not proper secure accommodation for the violent European soldiers who are sent in at this season. 3. The general condition of the asylum and its inmates is satisfactory. The number of admissions is the highest on record, with the exception of 1871-72, when the transfer of lunatics from Trichinopoly and the Monegar Choultry gave it a fictitious value. The death-rate is 19 less than last year, and the percent- age of cures 24.26 on average population. No epidemic has visited the asylum, although the season has been unhealthy, and the town and suburbs of Madras have suffered from epidemics of various kinds. No accidents of a serious nature, nor suicides, nor homicides have occurred. 4
14 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. There have been five escapes during the year, three of whom were brought back, and of the remaining two, who were admitted as criminals, one was trans- ferred to the ordinary list as his time of imprisonment had expired. These two patients made their escape by getting upon the roof of the latrine, and thence on to the main wall, from which it is supposed they let themselves down by cloths they had borrowed or stolen from other patients. Nothing has since been heard of them although the matter was at once reported to the Police authorities. One of them, an old offender, had been on two different occasions an inmate of the asylum and gave great trouble. He was transferred to Rajahmundry Jail, much of his madness being feigned. 4. The number of patients remaining under treatment on the 31st March 1879 was 227. The numbers on the same dates for the three past years having beenANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 15 should be sustained without damage, and in various trials steadfastness and trust still preserved." It is most difficult, however, to trace the indications of hereditary predisposi- tion, owing16 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 6 per cent., and in melancholia 9 cases out of 41, recovered. In acute dementia 2 cases out of 7 recovered, but in chronic dementia only 1 out of 43 was cured. The admissions also were most numerous under acute mania and chronic mania, melancholia numbering only about half either of the forms of mania. This affords confirmation of the physical character of insanity. As, in common with other diseases, cures are more numerous during the acute stage while the malady is in progress, and less so after changes in the cerebral substance have resulted and a chronic state supervened. 8. The number of deaths during the year under review has been 47, of whom 39 were males and 8 females, being a percentage ofANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 17 With regard to the causes of deaths, they were as follow :18 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. cure. Mild counter-irritation is frequently of marked benefit, and a blister on the nape of the neck has, in many cases, transformed a violent and maniacal patient into a mild and rational inmate; but care is always taken that remedies of this class should not assume a punitive character. The same may be said of the shower. bath, douche warm bath, and tepid sponging, from which great benefit is experi enced. The non-restraint system is the rule of the institution, and its salutary effects are often markedly observable in new admissions brought in under the custody of several men, and often bound or hand-cuffed with a character for much violence, who on being set at liberty and treated according to the rules of the asylum, frequently behave quietly and well. At the same time it is imperative that discipline be maintained, and the system of non-restraint must not be permitted to become one of terrorism of the strong and violent over the feeble and timid. If a patient becomes dangerous or annoying to others, he is at once removed to a separate room, or to another ward, and sometimes it is found sufficient to take him for a brisk walk, after which he quiets down. This is usually effectual with noisy patients who sing or shout and disturb the others at night : the warders are required to walk them up and down till they become composed, after which they usually sleep, and this often proves the best hypnotic. Exercise in the open air must be regarded as an important point of treatment, exercising as it does a salutary effect on the general health, and affording, as it were, a safety-valve, by means of which restless- ness and excess of energy may be dissipated. I have established the custom, which I find highly profitable, that all patients who do not join in some active employment through the day should walk morning and evening round the grounds, which are extensive and well planted with avenues of fine trees. I find these walks conducive of quiet by day and of healthy natural sleep by night. The women also, whose chief occupation, sewing, is of a sedentary nature, extend their walk in the evenings beyond the limits of the enclosure allotted to them, and the change of scene is cheerful and refreshing to them. It is much to be wished that the benefit of sea air could be added to this, but the distance from the shore, about 4 miles, and want of any means of conveying them thither, precludes all but a few of the richer patients from enjoying this advantage. With those whose friends can afford a conveyance, I make a point of the evening drive to the beach, which I find very beneficial. Under treatment must not be omitted work and recreation, both most neces- sary to divert the mind from painful introspection and imaginary troubles. On both these points more will be said, but as a remedial measure their importance cannot be over-estimated. It is pleasant to see one native employed in winding thread : he runs backwards and forwards, spindle in hand, cheerful and happy and absorbed in his work, walking miles in the course of the day, and is a notable instance of the cheering and enlivening effects of occupation. Out-door work has the further advantage of being most healthful. The Madras Asylum with its large grounds dotted with detached cottages, the patients employed in gardening, weaving, carrying water, and other homely occupations, assisted by their warders who work with them, more nearly approaches the spirit of the Gheel community in many respects, and has few points of resemblance to the prison-like and crowded asylums we too frequently see. 10. The subject of occupation is one of great importance in the treatment of the insane; for if idleness is productive of evil amongst the sane, much more so in those whose minds have lost the balance, which would enable them to regulate their actions and thoughts aright, whose idle broodings would turn on delusions and fancies dependent on their malady. To provide constant, interesting, and cheerful occupation must be the aim of those engaged in the care of the insane, and that this should be rational and useful, and this appeal to their sense of the practical is an additional advantage. These requirements are amply met by the weaving operations, which have been successfully established. The work requires a certain amount of care and attention sufficient to abstract the worker from his own thoughts and direct them on the work in hand. It interests him to see the material growing beneath his hand, and most of the weavers are able to appreciate
ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 19 the goodness of the material, and to feel a certain amount of pleasure in thus provid- ing for his own and his fellows' requirements. It also furnishes a variety of occupations suited to the powers of different patients, such as spinning, winding, and starching the thread, filling the spindles, and so on. Four English and four country looms are at work, turning out on an average 14 yards daily of good, strong material marked with the asylum stripe woven in, so that it cannot be stolen without detection. The thread is supplied by Government, and the labor being free, the cost of the clothing is reduced to a minimum, as may be readily seen by comparison of the cost of this year's clothing, calculated at the contractor's rates, amounting to Rupees 1,494-4-6 with the actual cost, Rupees 778-3-6. The weaving is carried on in one of the buildings within the criminal enclosure for greater security of the thread and the looms, &c. The country looms are under temporary sheds near the building. A register of the thread issued and of the material woven is kept, and the pieces are taken charge of by the Senior Apothecary, and by him issued to the Matron; the Head Tailor, under her superin- tendence, cuts out the cloth, which is made up by the female patients, assisted by the tailor, with the sewing machine. In addition to the woven-in line it is stamped with the asylum mark, and under these precautions and the present system of foil and counter-foil in the issue and receipt of clothing the loss has been nil. In addition to the weaving and needle-work, gardening occupies a certain number of patients. The vegetables in the criminal enclosure not proving very profitable, and leaving unsightly plots of ground when out of season, have not been laid down this year, and, as the enclosure is the scene of busy industry in weaving, &c., it is considered sufficient to lay out the ground with shrubs and evergreens, which may prove a lasting source of refreshment to the eye, and especially grateful and cheering during the hot dry season. The planting and care of young trees has been continued, and drawing water for them affords employment to many, and in particular to some of the idiots who are incapable of any other occupation ; as the old avenues of mangoes decay, these young asokas, casuarinas, will take their place, and graft mangoes replace the common kind. Sweeping and cleaning up leaves, cutting roads and hedges, sifting earth for conservancy purposes, &c., form useful means of employment, and the grounds which are kept in order by the patients and their warders afford testimony by their trim appearance to the industry of the inmates. A few patients assist at the cook-room and in carrying round the food, and a wonderful amount of trustworthiness is to be found in some of them. 11. Recreation.20 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. it is a source of much pleasure to the inmates. The library is still kept up, although few additions have been made; it forms a constant source of entertain- ment to the more enlightened patients. A pleasing exception to the monotony of asylum life occurs at Christmas, due to the liberality of the public, who subscribe to afford the inmates an entertainment, at which many of the residents of Madras are good enough to be present, and thus add to the enjoyment of the poor lunatics who, for once in the year, meet their sane fellow-creatures face to face. Their usual quiet and orderly behavior on these occasions testify to the good effects of this one joyous break in the dull routine of their lives. A Christmas dinner is followed by sports, jugglers, sack and chatty races, dancing, and fireworks, and presents are distributed to such as have done good work during the year. 12. The weekly services have again been resumed by the Chaplain of Vepery, under an Order of Government, No. 601, of the 20th March 1879. Should it be, at a future time, practicable to introduce music into these services, it would render them more attractive and pleasing.

It may also be remembered that while the cost of the clothing for the present year as shown above was Rupees 1,009-13-4, its value calculated at the contractor's rates amounts to Rupees 1,715-14-4 as shown in Cash Account Form 9. The material manufactured in the asylum is vastly superior to that formerly supplied by the contractor, and it is scarcely possible any further saving can be effected under this head, the clothing and bedding of each patient amounting only on an average to Europeans Rupees 12-15-11 and Natives Rupees 5-1-8. The cost of each patient during the year has beenANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 23 The official visitors have regularly inspected the asylum monthly. Vaccination has been satisfactorily carried on. I certify that the orders respecting the custody of poisonous drugs issued by the Principal Inspector-General, Indian Medical Department, dated 23rd January 1863, are carefully carried out.

During the year 55 male and 13 female patients were under treatment; of these 39 males and 8 females remained from the previous year. 3. Admissions.ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 25 Of the 14 fatal cases the health on admission was good in 6, fair 2, indifferent 1, bad 3, and very bad 2. Of the 6 whose health on admission was "good," 1 was a confirmed epileptic who had frequent and severe attacks which ultimately proved fatal; he had been two years and six months in the asylum. Two lived more than three years and five months, 1 over one year and eight months, 1 one year, and the last ten months. Of the 2 marked " fair," 1 a confirmed epileptic with frequent attacks, which in the end proved fatal; he lived over five months, and the other lived over seven years. The man noted as " indifferent "died within two months, as he came in a dying state. Of 5 recorded as " bad " and " very bad," 1 died within two months, 1 in four months, and 3 others lived one year and one month, five years and six months, and three years and six and a half months respectively. One death occurred in an old woman of 80 years, 8 over 30 years, 2 over 20 years, 2 over 10 years, and 1 in his seventh year. The subjoined table shows the ages, health on admission, disease causing death, and period of residence in the asylum of the fatal cases :26 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. some very neat ones have been turned out. Another branch of labor has also been introduced in preparing coir for ropes, which is done by the females. 9. On Christmas and on some of the more important native festivals, the inmates were given a little entertainment in the shape of extra diet, fowl curry, fruits, sweets, &c., and promenaded about the asylum grounds with their musical instruments. 10. Sheep-farming has been tried, but has been a total failure this year, as almost the whole of the animals died from disease. In the month of August 74 sheep were bought, but from some cause they got diarrhANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 27 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE LUNATIC ASYLUM, CALICUT, FOR THE YEAR 1878-79.

OSWALD, M.D., Indian Medical Department, to the Acting Chief Secretary to Government, dated 30th June 1879, No. 325-A, forwarding Annual Report on Lunatic Asylums for 1878-79. ORDER THEREON, 26th November 1879, No. 2982. * Madras, Vizagapatam, and Calicut. The Acting Surgeon-General, Indian Medical Department, submits the reports on the working of the three* Lunatic Asylums in this Presidency during the year 1878-79. He compares the propor- tion of lunatics under treatment to popu- lation in Madras, Bengal Proper, and Scotland, and of pauper lunatics in England, and states " nothing certain is known regarding the comparative frequency of insanity in India and Europe," and that the great disparity in the rates given " indicates that only a little of the subjects of insanity in India come under official cognizance." 2.The accommodation in the three asylums was sufficient for 703 inmates, but the maximum number confined during any one night in the year did not exceed 342. There were on the 1st April 1878 315 inmates in the asylum44 5.The largest number of admissions was of persons between the ages of 20 and 40, and 40 to 60. This, it is stated, accords with the experience of former years, and is in keeping with the average proportional age on admission in England during 36 years. The admissions are classified thus45 10.The financial results are as follow :ANNUAL REPORT ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN THE MADRAS PRESIDENCY DURING THE YEAR 1879-80. MADRAS: PRINTED BY E.

OFFICE OF SURGEON-GENERAL, C.M.D., FORT ST. GEORGE, 5th July 1880. No. 325, From Surgeon-General W. R. CORNISH, F.R.C.S., C.I.E., Civil Medical Department, To R. DAVIDSON, ESQ., C.I.E., Chief Secretary to Government, Judicial Department, Fort St. George. SIR, I HAVE the honor to submit, for the information of His Excellency the Most Noble the Governor in Council, the Annual Report on the Lunatic Asylums of the Madras Presidency for 1879-80. 2. During this period there has taken place a great improvement in public health of the general population. Food grains decreased in price, and there was a general immunity from cholera in all parts of the country. The lunatic population in asylums felt the influence of the changed hygienic conditions indicated by plentiful food supplies, and absence of epidemic disease, and their physical condition as shown by lowered death-rate had changed for the better. 3.

Dr. Smith remarks in explanation, "only hopeless and incurable cases are retained in this asylum, and many of them are subjects of organic disease and impaired constitution, the result of malnutrition and from mental disease, also of starvation and exposure prior to admission." Dr. Smith reports that occupation, recreation, appropriate diet with plenty of fresh air are the remedies chiefly trusted to for promoting recovery. All the deaths, he says, except two occurred amongst the non-workers. The asylum buildings are stated to require repair, and accommodation is required for the segregation of violent and noisy patients. Dr. Smith speaks well of his medical subordinate (Assistant Apothecary White) and establishment. Financially the cost of the institution hasfallen from Rupees 7,929-8-6 in 1878-79 to Rupees 6,323-10-6 in the present year. This sum appears to include an item of Rupees 104-6-3 for purchase of sheep, but no particulars are given to show whether the sheep-farming in the past year has been profitable or the reverse.

No new buildings have been erected since last report, but the two latrines in the criminal enclosure and that adjoining were removed from the main wall 10 feet, as it was found that they facilitated escapes, and since this was done none have occurred in the criminal jail. In vacating my post as Superintendent I think it only right to allude to the great necessity that exists for strong cottages for violent patients which have been sanctioned by Government, but not as yet erected for want of funds. Whenever these may be available the secure wards for violent patients and the upper story for the Superintendent's quarters should be put up. My experience of five and-a-half years at the asylum convinces me that these are much wanted for the security of the Superintendent's family and of the officials and inmates generally. 3. General condition of the asylum and its inmates is satisfactory. The number of admissions appears to be on the increase, exceeding by 6 the admissions during the corresponding period of last year, which was the highest hitherto recorded, with the exception of 1871-72, when the transfer of insanes from Trichinopoly and the Monegar Choultry took place. The death-rate is less by 13 than that of the preceding year. No epidemics have visited the asylum, although such were prevalent in Madras and its suburbs. No accidents of any moment have occurred, and I am happy to state that during the five and-a-half years I was in charge no homicide or suicide occurred. There has been only one escape during the seven months under review, and that of a quiet and harmless patient. The usual steps were taken to recover him, but he has not been recaptured; however one of the two patients who escaped last year from the criminal enclosure was brought back by a warder; as he had recovered he was discharged. 4. The number of patients remaining under treatment on the 31st October 1879 was 246. There were 15 deaths during the seven months. Of this number 7 were above one year's residence in the asylum. Four of them were over 50 years of age, and of these one was 80.

The subject of occupation in a Lunatic Asylum must be looked upon as a remedial measure of the greatest importance. To afford work of a light and interesting kind must be the object aimed at, remuneration being a very secondary consideration. The weaving, which is now carried on, both affords a variety of occupation suited to different classes of patients, and is also a source of economy, making the cost of the clothing and bedding almost nominal. Gardening opera- tions are also a healthful form of occupation, and these with cleaning, sweeping, drawing, and filling the water carts, cutting roads and trimming hedges, afford employment to all the inmates. 11. Recreation does not form so prominent a feature as I would wish to see. There are many difficulties to be encountered. The distance from the various places of amusement preclude their being visited by any of the inmates. The Band of the 39th Regiment played for some weeks, but the corps being ordered off this treat was discontinued. 12. The weekly services were continued regularly by the Chaplain of Vepery. 13. The sanitary condition is very satisfactory, and the dry-earth system works well and is carefully carried out. The various means taken to ensure cleanli- ness and health have been so frequently detailed in former reports that it is unnecessary to comment further upon them. The present sanitary condition of the asylum leaves little or nothing to be desired. 14. No improvement has been effected in the lighting of the asylum. 15. It is most desirable that the cottages for better-class patients should be furnished in a more appropriate manner. 16. The financial statement for the seven months as compared with the same period of the previous year is very satisfactory, as the expenditure is less by nearly Rupees 1,300, although the admissions are more numerous.

The latter owing to the increased number of admissions, more especially amongst Europeans, and to the issue of extras, such as broth, bread, and milk to patients admitted in a weakly condition. 17. I cannot give over charge of the asylum without placing on record the high opinion I entertain of Mr. Hardaker, who in a very trying post rendered me all the assistance in his power and carried out my orders with care and attention. Assistant Apothecary Sunjeevee has worked well during the short time he has been under me. He is very attentive and painstaking and kind and considerate to the inmates. The Matron, Mrs. Hennan, during the 4½ years that she has been in this asylum under me has done her work well, and by the careful manner in which she has carried out my orders and directions has done much to improve the condition of the female patients. She treated the patients with great kindness and induced them to work and employ themselves as they had never done before. I entertain a very high opinion of her character, which is thoroughly reliable and trustworthy.
ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 13 The two Head European Attendants, Bruce and Coleman, have worked very well during the past seven months and gave me no trouble. I always found them honest Withwhat was entrusted to them, and steady and careful in the performance of their duties. The two First-class East Indian Keepers, Muriel and Fowler, did their best to give me satisfaction. They both hold very trying posts, for which they are very inadequately paid. The Steward, K. Annu Chetty, has been under me for 5½ years, first as Writer and afterwards as Steward. He has now had considerable experience in the latter capacity, and I consider him a good and efficient steward, and have always found him honest and trustworthy. The Assistant Steward, Parthasarady Naidoo, has served under me as Writer and Assistant Steward for about 3½ years. He works hard and is attentive and painstaking. The Writer does his work to my satisfaction. The Night Watchmen have of late worked well. Of the Day Warders, Appavoo and Narrainsawmy deserve special mention for trustworthiness and efficiency. Several of the others work well and did their utmost to please me. The official visitors have regularly inspected the asylum monthly. Vaccination has been regularly performed. I certify that the orders respecting the custody of poisonous drugs issued by the Principal Inspector-General, Indian Medical Department, dated 23rd January 1863, were carefully carried out.

Surgeon-Major L. C. Nanney held the post of Superintendent for the first seven months of the year. His report is appended. No new buildings have been erected, but the latrines in the criminal enclosure have been removed 10 feet from the wall, as it was found that they facilitated escapes. The roofs of some of the general cottages and of the Superintendent's bun- galow will require attention during the year. The roads and paths require regravelling. This can be done by the patients if gravel be provided. The so-called "Idiot enclosure," in which the greater number of European and East Indian males pass the day, is a cheerless place, surrounded as it is by a wall 6 feet high, shutting out all view of the grounds. It would be much improved if the wall were removed and a low hedge planted in its stead. The old bricks could be utilized in repairing the roads. The general condition of the asylum and its inmates is satisfactory. The number of admissions is exactly the same as last year. There is a slight falling off in the number of cures. The death-rate is much lower. ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 15 Those only are classed "readmission" who are discharged and readmitted within the official year. A patient might be discharged in March and readmitted in the following April, but in this case would not be classed as a readmission. The admissions consist of16 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS.

The official visitors have regularly inspected the asylum monthly. Vaccination has been regularly performed.

During the year 49 male and 9 female lunatics were under treatment; of these 35 males and 7 females remained from last year. 3. Admissions.ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 21 6. Deaths.22 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. Of medicinal agents, bromide of potassium has proved beneficial in epilepsy, and hydrate of chloral in mania; morphia internally and hypodermically, mild counter-irritation to the nape, cold douche, shower bath, warm and tepid bathing, and exercise both morning and evening in the form of a good walk round the asylum grounds. Basket, date-mat making, and preparing coir for ropes are being carried on by the inmates. 10. The asylum buildings are sadly in want of repair, all of them not only being in a leaky condition, but requiring white and blue washing. The doors and woodwork of the buildings require repair, and the wood suffers for want of paint. The want of separate detached buildings for the segregation of violent and noisy lunatics is greatly needed, as such separate accommodation is necessary not only for the recovery of the violent themselves, but also on account of the bad effect produced by their being confined in the same apartment with convalescents. The whitewashing of the asylum has been taken on hand about the middle of March agreeably to G.O., No. 404, dated 25th February 1880, but the broken plastering ought to be put to rights before whitewashing is done. The hospital has been repaired since last report. 11. Sheep-farming has been continued in spite of last year's failure, and the amount realized this year by the sale was very encouraging. 12. One insane effected his escape at the close of the year, but was recap- tured within a few hours by the warders. 13. The annual Christmas entertainment, which included a dinner, music, races, and decorations, finishing up with a display of fireworks, afforded the patients a great treat, and was evidently appreciated by many of them. 14. The cost of maintaining an insane during the year in this asylum has been on an average Rupees 177-11-1, viz., diets Rupees 58-13-3, clothing Rupees 4-7-9, establishment Rupees 105-4-1, cost of medicines Rupees 2-10-11, and contin- gencies Rupees 6-7-1. The cost of dieting is recovered from the Treasury, and the other charges are credited to Government by the Treasury Officer agreeably to Proceedings of Government, dated 15th April 1875. Criminal lunatics are wholly supported by Government, and civil insanes by the various Local Fund Boards and Municipalities. 15. A meeting of the official visitors takes place monthly, 16.

There was one admission more this year, the numbers remained and total treated being less. The numbers cured show a decrease of one. The death-rate has happily very much diminished. The buildings are in fair repair. The several recommendations suggested and "sanctioned" still remain in nubibus, the scarcity of water in the hot months (as now) being a great and crying want.

39 GOVERNMENT OF MADRAS. JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT. Read letter from Surgeon-General W. R. CORNISH, F.R.C.S., C.I.E., with the Government of Madras, to the Chief Secretary to Government, dated Fort St. George, 5th July 1880, No. 325. ORDER THEREON, 24th August 1880, No. 2,077. With his letter, dated 5th July 1880, No. 325, the Surgeon-General with the Government of Madras submits the Annual Report on the Lunatic Asylums of the Presidency for the year 1879-80. 2. The more important general results for the year 1878-79 and 1879-80 are contrasted below:40 series of years. It was rendered possible by the carelessness of the subordinate native ayahs who neglected to watch the well, which is usually secured by a grating while it was open for drawing water. The Official Visitors propose that pumps should be set up to prevent the possibility of similar occurrences in future, and the question will be referred to the Public Works Department for consideration. 3. The year was on the whole more healthy than its predecessor as the dimi- nished percentage of the population daily sick shows. Fever was prevalent much more than in 1878-79, though dysentery was less active. 4. The percentage of cures to admissions in the year under review is 41.86, and is lower than in any year since 1873-74 except 1876-77 (32.55). It is noticeable that in 1877-78 the percentage was as high as 64.66. Famine brought out or devel- oped mental disease which yielded to treatment more easily on the removal of the predisposing cause. The low percentage this year indicates the return of the general population to its normal condition and cannot be ascribed to treatment. The per- centage of recoveries under the principal classes of mental disease to total treated is contrasted below for the years 1878-79 and 1879-80 :41 are said to want repair and separate accommodation for the segregation of violent or noisy patients. The execution of the necessary repairs and the provision of the requisite accommodation will be considered in the Public Works Department. Dr. Nanney, on leaving the Madras Asylum after 5½ years' experience, alludes in his report to the great necessity that exists for strong cottages for violent patients, and the Public Works Department will be requested to allot the necessary funds for their erection as early as possible. 9. There has been no change in the system of treatment adopted ; occupation, recreation, and appropriate diet with plenty of fresh air are the remedies chiefly trusted to in promoting recovery. The means of recreation at the Madras Asylum are reported to be capable of improvement. The Superintendent should make definite proposals to this end, which is of so much importance to the health of the inmates. 10. The financial results compare with those for 1878-79 as follows:ANNUAL REPORT ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN THE MADRAS PRESIDENCY DURING THE YEAR 1880-81. MADRAS: PRINTED BY E.

8 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 14. Sickness in Asylums.ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 9 The committee did not find that any increase of the number of European warders was essential, but recommended that the pay of two of them should be increased, and that they should reside on the premises; also that the Native warders, on whom the immediate custody of the patients depends, should be graded and better paid, so as to ensure continuance of service, and, if possible, more trustworthy agents. 20. The orders of Government in regard to the recommendations of the com- mittee will be passed in due course, but I may state that I am quite satisfied of the necessity of improving the condition of the warders, as recommended by the com- mittee, so as to ensure better supervision. The Madras Lunatic Asylum, from its construction on the detached cottage system, and the wide area over which the buildings are spread, is one very difficult of supervision and management, and requires great care and intelligence on the part of all the administrative staff. 21. Although these two accidents have occurred during Dr. Leapingwell's administration, I am satisfied that he has devoted his time and energies to his charge with great zeal and intelligence, and I have much pleasure in bringing to the notice of Government that the interests of the patients have been well cared for under his management. Dr. Leapingwell's report is carefully drawn up, and testifies to the interest he takes in the important duties committed to his charge. I have visited the asylum on several occasions during the year, and have had ample opportunities of observing his management of the insane. I trust that the hands of the Superintendent may be strengthened in the direction pointed out by the committee. The Subordinate Medical Establishment consists of Apothecary Hardaker and Civil Apothecary Jones, who, as a rule, have performed the duties satisfactorily. Mr. Hardaker has, since the end of the year, been relieved by Apothecary Watts. The Matron has conducted her duties to the satisfaction of the Superintendent. 22. Waltair.10 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 27. The asylum was in charge of Surgeon-Major Roberts during the year, whose humanity and kindness to the afflicted are well known to Government. The asylum is at an inconvenient distance from Calicut, and the resident medical officer was Second-class Hospital Assistant M. Lingasen, who has continued to merit the approval of his superior and the official visitors for the efficient manner in which he performs his duties. The overseer and warders are favorably reported on. 28. In regard to medical treatment of the insane, there is very little difference of practice in any of the asylums. More dependence is placed on careful nursing and general hygiene, including exercise, occupation, food, cleanliness, &c., than in any system of treatment by drugs. Dr. Leapingwell, indeed, seems to indicate that in the majority of cases the insanes do better without soothing drugs than with them, and his remarks on this subject are worthy of consideration by all who have to deal with asylum management. 29. There is no doubt that rational exercise and bodily occupation are of great importance in the treatment of the insane. Nothing conduces so much to sound sleep and brain rest, as work or occupation in the open air, that tries the muscles. These points are well attended to in all the asylums, and amusements are not lacking for those capable of enjoying them. In rational occupation, amusements, exercise and feeding, with regular hours, and avoidance of all causes of unnatural excitement, are the chief means of restoring health and tone to feeble brains. FINANCE. 30. I have thought it better to refer to the cost of Lunatic Establishments under a separate head rather than to review the expenses of each separately. The charges connected with Lunatic Establishments for the past three years were as follows :ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 11 32. Diets and supplies for all the asylums are provided by contractors. The food in all cases has been good and plentiful, and the best evidence of its sufficiency is that all the patients whose mental condition improve gain in weight during their residence in an asylum. 33. The recoveries for dieting patients have been larger than in any previous year, as have been also the proceeds from manufactures in asylums, as the following particulars will show. I hope the gardening operations in Madras, where labor is plentiful, will soon show a considerable advantage to the asylum :12 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS.

Since I have been in charge of this asylum I have found the hospital accom- modation provided for the males to be quite inadequate for the purpose, and have been obliged to take over the general cottage nearest to the hospital for the treatment of a portion of the sick, reserving the former hospital for the more severe cases. I have also placed Second-class Warder Appavoo in charge of the hospital. This man, an old sepoy, was one of the two warders mentioned by my predecessor in his last report as trustworthy, and, as I found him employed as a peon for carrying letters, I considered his services might be turned to better account in hospital, and I am glad to say that the nursing and feeding of the sick, which at one time gave me much cause for dissatisfaction, has under his supervision greatly improved. There have been 23 deaths, giving a percentage of 8.82 to average daily strength and 6.25 to total treated. This is lower than in any year since 1872.

The warders all said that they heard a noise, and on running to the weaving shed found the deceased lying insensible, but that they saw no one near him. At my evening visit, at about 5 P.M., a criminal patient told me that if I would take him to the office he would tell me all, but that he was afraid to speak before the other patients. He then mentioned the names of three men who, he said, had beaten the deceased, and also the names of three men who had seen the beating. I then had these men put in single rooms to await the Coroner's inquest. The following morning an inquiry was held and adjourned. It was not till the Coroner had left the asylum and 24 hours after the murder that the warders who had been on duty in the enclosure came forward to give evidence, stating that they had been afraid to tell the truth before, as two of the patients had threatened to kill them. The Coroner brought in a verdict of wilful murder against two patients named Ramudoo and Chinnapial, both men who had been previously found guilty of murder and acquitted on the grounds of insanity. Neither of them had shown any symptoms of insanity after admission into the asylum. They were sub- sequently taken before the Magistrate and committed to the Sessions. At the trial they were acquitted for want of evidence, the Judge making severe remarks on the evidence given by the warders. The Second-class Warder Chokkalingum admitted having given the key of the weaving shed to the accused Ramudoo, knowing that he was breaking the rules of the asylum, but stating as an excuse that he knew Ramudoo to be sane and to be a good man. The injuries were inflicted with wooden blocks used in spinning, and the murder could not possibly have occurred if the warder had not given up the key of the weaving room, as there was nothing in the enclosure on that day which could be used as a weapon. Occupation.ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 19 Dr. Rayne's lectures on insanity at Middlesex Hospital and Medical Super- intendent at Hanwell writes : "In the medicinal treatment of the insane I have entirely abandoned the use of the so-called neurotic medicines, which have been supposed to exercise a direct curative action on the brain. I am convinced that nothing can be more injurious to the brain than the continued use of drugs, which act directly on it and pervert its nutrition." In examining cases of recent insanity it will always be found that the digestive organs are disordered, and that the patients are an20 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. is under the heading " Diets." This is owing to the lower contract rates and to a very greatly diminished issue of " extras." Contingencies show a decrease of Rs. 1,800 and odd, and wines and spirits a decrease of Rs. 240. Financial Condition. ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 21 In the annual report for last year I had to give an unfavorable account of the two Head Attendants and the Native Warders. When I took over charge of the asylum I found the Head Attendants bore good characters, and the Native Warders for the first time for many years were well spoken of. This improvement in the conduct of the Native Warders had evidently been of very short duration, for in the report for 1878-79 I find my predecessor, after holding the post of Superintendent for five years, had nothing better to report than the following :22 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. I have not mentioned the Night Watchmen especially, as I include them under "Warders." I find in the annual report for 1878-79 that "their work is most carefully supervised by the Head Sergeants and Medical Subordinates." I do not hold these men responsible for the supervision of the Night Watchmen, as, if they do their day work properly, they cannot reasonably be expected to be about at night. The tell-tale clocks are really the only checks on the Night Watchmen. The official visitors have regularly visited the asylum monthly. Vaccination has been carried out during the cold season. I certify that the orders respecting the custody of poisonous drugs issued by the Principal Inspector-General, Indian Medical Department, dated 23rd January 1863, were carefully carried out. A. H.

Of these 31 males and 6 females remained from the previous year. 2. Admissions.24 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. Before noticing these figures more particularly, it is necessary to premise that they indicate the ages on admission and not those at which mental disease origi- nated, as in the majority of cases it would be utterly impossible to obtain reliable information on the latter point. This, of course, detracts somewhat from the value of the statement, but still it may be accepted as throwing considerable light on the periods of life at which the mental powers are most liable to succumb to disease. It will be observed that, as in last annual report, the greatest number of admissions is recorded between the ages of 20 and 40. This is in accordance with experience in other parts of the world, and may be explained by the fact that, at that period of life, both males and females are most exposed to influences (physical and moral) likely to induce mental diseases. It is also possible that, at this term of life, there may be a special tendency or liability to insanity, it being a well-known patholo- gical fact that age materially influences the liability to certain forms of disease. The occupation of the several patients admitted were :ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 25 Of the 31 admissions during the year no less than 64.5l per cent. were cases of acute mania. The next most common type amongst admissions was chronic mania. Taking the whole Asylum population during the year, the most common form of insanity was acute mania, and next to that chronic mania and chronic dementia. Further particulars under this head are given in Table VI of Appendix. 3. Discharges.26 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. Name. Age. Health on Admission. Disease causing Death.

DiarrhANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 27 There is more than ample accommodation for the civil lunatics, as the present buildings are large enough to receive double the number of inmates which they now contain. There is but one female criminal lunatic in the Asylum, and there is no separate accommodation for her ; so she remains with the other females. This woman had drowned her child and was sent to this Asylum by order of Government. It does not much matter allowing this woman to remain with the female civil lunatics, but at any time there might be female criminal lunatics, for whom it would be desirable to have separate accommodation. Sanction has been obtained for providing separate accommodation for the segregation of violent and noisy patients, but the work has not yet been commenced, and the sooner it is taken on hand the better. At present the want of the same is greatly felt, as a very large proportion of cases of insanity may be restored to mental health under judicious treatment, but such a treatment is simply impossible so long as the whole body are indiscriminately kept in the same ward. The office has been condemned during the year, as it was considered unsafe owing to the dangerous state of its roof. It is undergoing reconstruction, and in the mean while the hospital is used as an office. 9. A few sheep have been kept to graze and improve the poor soil of the Asylum premises. The amount realized this year by the sale of sheep, date mats, &c., was Rs. 143-10-5, which includes Rs. 104-6-3, the amount disbursed on the 21st January 1880 for the purchase of sheep. 10. The annual treat for the lunatics, which was given on Pongul feast day at the expense of the Superintendent, consisted of a dinner in the shape of fowl curry and rice, fruits, sweets, music, races, and decorations, which afforded the patients unmixed pleasure, and its good effect was evinced by the quiet and decorous manner in which the patients conducted themselves during its performance, and their cheerfulness and even gaiety, and this kind of mild excitement is the only thing that causes the slightest appearance of animation amongst those usually listless and apathetic. 11. There has been no escape during the year. 12. The cost of maintaining an insane during the year in this Asylum has been on an average Rs. 163-9-4, viz. :28 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS.

I held the same opinion of this Hospital Assistant in 1878, when I was acting for Dr. Roberts, and still hold it. Overseer Timothy was appointed on probation on the 1st August 1880; he does his work satisfactorily, and I can recommend him to be confirmed in his appoint- ment. The Duffadars and Warders do their duty, which at all times is trying and irksome, satisfactorily. Vaccination is regularly kept up.

CORNISH, F.R.C.S., C.I.E., Surgeon-General with the Government of Madras, to the Chief Secretary to Government, dated Ootacamund, 14th September 1881, No. 0-122 [Current No. 2723]. ABSTRACT.48 is reported in the general physical condition of the lunatics. All the Asylums were free from epidemic disease. 4. With regard to the Criminal lunatics under confinement, the Surgeon-General observes that "Amongst this class there are detained in the Madras Asylum several persons who have never been pronounced insane by professional experts, and that, as recent experience has shown, their supervision and custody is attended by grave risks and embarrassment." This statement is calculated to create misapprehension. It is only in the case of criminal lunatics, convicted of murder or murderous assaults and acquitted on the ground of insanity, that the principle of perpetual detention49 Probably District Officers and local authorities might be able to direct the attention of friends and relatives of the insane to the advantages of early removal to an Asylum in cases coming under their observation.

Probably anything which lowers the general health in a person predisposed to insanity may be considered as an exciting cause. No cause was assigned in 55 out of the 94 admissions: 9 were supposed to be due to " Narcotic drugs," 5 to " Intemperance," and only 3 cases are returned as " Hereditary." Recoveries.12 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. Amusements.ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 13 There are now two First-class Warders on Rs. 12 and six Second-class Warders on Rs. 10. Formerly there were only four appointments of Rs. 9 open to the Third-class Warders. The pay of the third class has also been raised from Rs. 7 to 8. The pay will be well earned by any men who do this duty. I have had several applicants for these posts since the pay has been raised; before that it was difficult to get any one to fill a vacancy. The Official Visitors have regularly visited the asylum monthly. Vaccination has been carried out. I certify that the orders respecting the custody of poisonous drugs issued by the Principal Inspector-General, Indian Medical Department, dated 23rd January 1863, were carefully carried out.

The Sweepers (especially the male ones) have been much given to absence without leave. They are always sure of employment and can combine, so they are difficult to deal with. The Dhoby is underpaid, receiving only Rs. 20 per mensem for the washing of 300 people of dirty or careless habits. The washing has not been satisfactorily done. IV.ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 17 Of the 27 military patients 16 were Europeans. The 11 Native military included 1 East Indian trumpeter. Of the 16 Europeans 1 was an officer, 8 were artillerymen, and the rest were infantry. The majority of the infantry came from Burmah. The remarkable proportion of artillerymen, considering the small strength of artillery compared with that of the infantry in this Presidency, may be accidental. As artillerymen are usually more intelligent, more occupied, and better paid than the infantry, one would expect less insanity among them. But I understand that there is a larger proportion of courts-martial in the Royal Artillery. If this be due to greater drunkenness, one can understand the greater insanity. Two of the 16 soldiers were country-born, and so was the European military criminal. Of 7 European private patients18 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. (f.)

The asylum buildings have been repaired by the Public Works Department during the year and are in want of white and blue washing, and after much delay and correspondence an estimate has been prepared and forwarded through the Surgeon-General for the sanction of Government. The office has been occupied during the year, and the hospital, which was repaired in the latter part of 1879, was again vacated in October last as it was con- sidered unsafe by the District Engineer, Vizagapatam, owing to the dangerous state of its roof. The insecurity of the criminal ward was reported, and the Government in their Order No. 2134, dated 15th October 1881, sanctioned iron-barred doors to the ward and a spiked railing over the gate of the criminal enclosure, and these altera- tions have been recently executed by the Public Works Department, but are not yet quite completed. There is a defect which militates greatly against the successful working of this asylum, and that is the want of separate detached buildings for the segregation of violent and noisy lunatics. Both sections of the asylum, male and female, are equally in need of these buildings. It is not too much to say that a very large proportion of cases of insanity may be restored to mental health under judicious treatment, but such a treatment is simply impossible so long as all classes are indiscriminately kept in the same ward. Sanction has been obtained for the construction of separate accommodation for violent patients, but the work has not been taken on hand for want of funds. The lighting of the asylum is very defective and obsolete, and it is highly desirable that kerosine oil should be introduced. This would cause no increase of expenditure beyond the first outlay for lamps. The annual treat for the lunatics was given on Pongal feast day, and generally the lunatics amused themselves by playing the native musical instruments with which they are provided ; they are also allowed to play cards and chess. The cost of maintaining an insane during the year in this asylum has been on an average Rs. 166-8-0, viz., diets Rs. 41-8-3, clothing Rs. 1-8-4, establishment Rs. 112-1-9, cost of medicines Rs. 5, and contingencies, including stationery, Rs. 6-5-8. The cost of dieting is recovered from the treasury and the other charges are credited to Government by the Treasury Officer agreeably to Proceedings of Gov- ernment, dated 15th April 1875. Criminal lunatics are wholly supported by Government and civil insanes by the various Local Fund Boards and Municipalities.

Of the 65 remaining at the close of the year, 51 have gained in weight; 3 remain in statu quo, and 11 lost in weight. The weight of each patient is taken at the end of every month. This system is a guide to me to prescribe extras, tonics, &c., as loss in weight in lunatics is always a bad sign. Sometimes a little extras in the shape of milk, arrack, &c., improve their condition at once; while in some cases the mental disorder is so great that no extras or medicines of any kind are of any use, and they gradually, but surely, die from atrophy. Of the 11 patients that lost in weight 5 of them are old-standing cases, 2 reported in 1878 as deteriorating, 2 restless, and 2 troublesome patients. The subjoined table will show the weight of each patient at the close of the year:ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 27 The buildings are in a fair state of repair. The sanctioned amount for repairs was Rs. 288, which was expended. Besides this a sum of Rs. 89 was spent by the Hospital Assistant in whitewashing, &c., the buildings as cholera was expected, and I was anxious to have the asylum in as good a sanitary condition as possible. Water-supply is ample. Two new wells and one repaired have been finished. The work was superintended by the Hospital Assistant, and every Engineer has expressed his entire satisfaction in the manner it has been done. The accompanying eleven statements show in detail the statistics of the asylum for the year. Rs. 337-8-4 was obtained by lunatic labor, and of this sum Rs. 278-11-1 were sent to the treasury and the balance spent in treats and amuse- ments for the lunatics. Establishment.APPENDIX. 3

GOVERNMENT OF MADRAS. JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT. ORDER( 46 ) detained there. It is observed, however, that since 1878-79 the average rate is nearly double of the average of the seven years preceding that year. A strict inquiry should therefore be instituted at the earliest opportunity, in view to ascertaining whether, in addition to the cause assigned, there exist special topical causes tending to produce excessive mortality. 5. The gross charge for all three Asylums is Rs. 5,632 in excess of last year's figure, and is ascribed to the revision of establishments and the improved scale of diet recently introduced. Against this expenditure the Surgeon-General is able to point to an increase in recoveries for boarding lunatics and in the sale proceeds of manu- facture, which together reduce this excess to about Rs. 3,500. 6. The Government observe with pleasure the testimony borne by the Surgeon- General to the care and efficiency displayed by the officers placed in charge of these institutions. (True Extract.) C. G. MASTER, Chief Secretary.

SIR, I HAVE the honor to submit herewith, for the information of the Right Honor- able the Governor in Council, the reports on Lunatic Asylums in this Presidency, for the official year ending 31st March 1883.

In Madras, there was considerable prevalence of scorbutic dysentery, which required great care and attention in modification of diet to counteract. Many patients also were admitted in a feeble condition of health, and this was the case also in Calicut, where most of the deaths occurred in the newly admitted insane. In regard to epidemic diseases, there has been no preva- lence of them in the asylums, although in Calicut one lunatic was admitted with small-pox.

8 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 13. Sickness of Lunatics.ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 9 number of lunatics to be fed, clothed and watched, the treasury charges have increased from Rs. 62,271 in 1881-82 to Rs 75,911 in the past year. 26. It has been pointed out that, owing to a defect in the Municipal Act of the town of Madras, no recoveries can be made for pauper lunatics sent into the Madras Asylum from the town. 163 of such pauper lunatics are at present main- tained by Government without any contribution from Municipal funds. It is quite possible that a large number of Provincial lunatics find their way to the Presidency town, and, coming under the cognizance of the Police, are placed under observation, but it may be hoped that, in a review of the Madras Municipal Act, provision will be made for requiring the Municipality to pay the cost of its own lunatics, as is the practice of up-country towns and rural circles. 27. The increase of expenditure has been almost entirely under the headings of "establishment proper," "diet," "clothing and bedding," and bazaar supplies. 28. The receipts from private paying patients have considerably decreased in the past year ; but, on the other hand, the payments by local authorities for support of lunatics have increased. The sum of Rs. 4,695 was received from patients, and Rs. 11,224 from Local Boards and Municipalities. 29. The several asylums have been managed with care and economy by the Superintendents. They have been regularly inspected by the official visitors appointed by Government. Although I should wish to see more systematic and profitable employment of asylum labor, yet it must be borne in view that there are difficulties in the way of finding employment for the lunatics, which might help to make the asylums in a measure self-supporting. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, W. R. CORNISH, Surgn.-Genl., F.R.C.S., C.I.E., Surgeon-General with the Government of Madras. 3

Sedatives to those who are excitable, and those given are always bromide of potassium in conjunc- tion with chloral. The cold douche is also given to moderate undue excitement. 8. Occupation consists in gardening, tailoring, weaving, &c. Rs. 246-0-4 was realized by lunatic labour, and of this, Rs. 148-7-6 was remitted to the treasury; the balance was spent in giving treats to the inmates. The annual Christmas treat was given to the inmates this year, which they all seemed to heartily enjoy. Many of the native gentry honoured the asylum with their presence, and a few of the Europeans. Besides the above treat, several native festivities were recognized by the administration of extras, betel, tobacco, sweet- meats, &c. 9.

GOVERNMENT OF MADRAS. JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT. ORDER( 42 ) of the existing data for drawing any safe conclusion on the subject. It is invariably most difficult, both owing to wilful or careless suppression of facts by relatives, and to the interchangeable character of nervous diseases, to trace the indications of a hereditary predisposition to insanity. 4. There were 43 deaths in the three asylums, and while the mortality in the Madras and Calicut Asylums was higher than usual, that in the Waltair Asylum was exceptionally low. In the Madras Asylum during the months of July, August and September, the health of the patients was bad owing to an outbreak of scurvy. The number of sick admitted into hospital under the headings Diarrh( 43 ) cost of bazaar medicines Rs. 5-10-7 per patient. The attention of the Surgeon- General is drawn to the differences in the expenditure under the above heads in these asylums. 7. The Government are glad that the Surgeon-General is able again to report generally on the satisfactory condition of the asylums and their management. The question of the profitable employment of the labor of the asylum patients should continue to receive the attention of the authorities. (True Extract.) E. F. WEBSTER, Acting Chief Secretary.

OFFICE OF THE SURGEON-GENERAL WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF MADRAS, OOTACAMUND. 24th June 1884. No. O/179. From W. R. CORNISH, ESQ., F.R.C.S., C.I.E., Surgeon-General with the Government of Madras, To THE HONORABLE E. F. WEBSTER, Chief Secretary to Government, Judicial Department. SIR, I HAVE the honor to forward, for the information of the Right Honorable the Governor in Council, the reports on the lunatic asylums of this Presidency for the official year ending 31st March 1884. 2. As pointed out in previous reports, there is a steady increase in the demand for asylum accommodation, due in part to the accumulation of criminal lunatics, and in part to greater activity of the police in arresting wandering lunatics. The Madras asylum, in regard to certain classes of patients, and especially of criminal lunatics, will require increased accommodation, while Government have already approved of additions to the Calicut asylum, which during the past year has been inconveniently overcrowded. 3.

I made a further enquiry myself on my inspection visit in April 1883, and although it seemed to me that there were suspicious circumstances in connection with the suspected warder, yet the fact of his intimacy with the woman was incapable of proof, apart from the woman's own statement. The Official Visitors, I believe, came to the same conclusion. The warder's services were dispensed with. I am not aware of a case of this kind having occurred before in any of our asylums. Since the occurrence measures have been taken to carry a wall around the female enclosure, and the night inspection of the female enclosure is done by the female warders, or the matron. 29. The result of my enquiry was that I could attach no blame to any one in particular. The native female attendants should certainly have had their attention directed to the woman's condition in the latter part of her pregnancy, but it escaped their notice. 30. The Superintendent and resident Hospital Assistant take great interest in the welfare of the insane, and I am satisfied that they are treated with kindness and humanity. 31.

The large number of native admissions, raising the number of inmates to 347, the highest number yet reached, is, I believe, due to increased energy on the part of the police in taking up wandering lunatics.

After a few days in these cases a change is observed by giving them good and regular diet, cold douche, chloral and bromide of potassium to ensure good sleep. Secondly.ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 25 The resident Medical Subordinate, Second-class Hospital Assistant M. Lingasen Pillay, No. 108, is still in executive charge of the asylum, and a better man could not be found for the management of lunatics in every way. The report in general speaks for his ability and attention to the inmates. The asylums at Vizagapatam and Madras have resident Apothecaries, and I recommend that the Hospital Assistant's personal allowance of Rs. 20 be raised to Rs. 30, as it must be remembered that, being in charge of an asylum two miles from the town, the Hospital Assistant has no private practice whatever. He devotes his whole time to the welfare of the unfortunate inmates of whom he has charge. Duffadars Govindnair and Powel have given the utmost satisfaction. Clerk Obed has lately been confirmed and works well. Matron Abey has lately been appointed and so far has given satisfaction. The Warders in general have given satisfaction, but at times some of them forget they have lunatics to deal with and lose their temper. Such conduct, as already noted, is severely dealt with.

GOVERNMENT OF MADRAS. JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT. ORDER( 44 ) remitted to the treasury on account of patients confined in the asylum, which should not have been calculated as a portion of the real expenditure on the asylums; deduct- ing this sum Rs. 85,576-14-3 remains as the net expenditure on the different institu- tions compared with Rs. 80,313-2-0, the expenditure calculated in the same way in the previous year. It is noted that while in the previous year only Rs. 1,747-0-2 were spent on account of work done by the Public Works department in the year under report Rs. 4,104-12-11 were spent under this head. The increase in the receipts from municipalities and local Boards on account of patients in the asylums is satis- factory. The maintenance of these three asylums saves local bodies from the necessity of maintaining similar institutions of their own, the care of lunatics being one of the duties imposed upon mofussil municipalities and local Boards by law. It is therefore only just that each local body should, as is the case now, be called upon to support the civil lunatic patients of its own district maintained in the Provincial asylums. The total annual cost of an insane in the asylums was as follows:ANNUAL REPORT ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN THE MADRAS PRESIDENCY DURING THE YEAR 1884-85. MADRAS: PRINTED BY E.

Great improvements have been made in the manufacturing department of the Madras asylum. Printing, washing, carpet making, carpentry and black- smith's work have been added to the asylum industries, which were only confined to weaving and making up of clothing and bedding, &c., during the previous years. In the Calicut asylum, weaving, coir-rope making, fibre spinning, tailoring, &c., are carried on. 31. On the whole the administration of the several asylums has been carried on efficiently during the year. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, M. C.

This allows of more freedom, and the open-door system can thus be more easily carried out in its entirety. Three native attendants have been dismissed for ill-treatment, and many have been punished for using unnecessary force. My predecessor encouraged the employment of pensioners as attendants, and the practice has been continued. Dent's portable tell-tale clocks, introduced in 1883, have worked so success- fully that they are now in use all over the asylum. The dhobies received small pay and washed badly. In December washing machines were started and are now worked by patients, the services of the dhobies having been dispensed with in January. This new system has worked well and affords daily employment for a number of patients. IV.12 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. Eurasian males ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 13 (d.)

A very interesting case of paralysis of the bladder was treated with great success. The patient is an old-standing case, having been in the asylum ten years. The bladder suddenly lost its contractile power and the urine had to be drawn off daily by the catheter. This was very hard to do, as the patient resented it very much, but by the patient coaxing and kind persuasion of the Hospital Assistant, the difficulty was overcome. The treatment consisted in the administration of tincture of nux vomica in 10 minim doses ter in die with the electro-magnetic machine and hot hip-bath. He eventually recovered. (l.)

( 45 ) GOVERNMENT OF MADRAS. JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT. ORDER( 46 ) The increases occur almost entirely under Acute mania and Melancholia, the figures under the other heads showing little alteration. It is observed that in the table of " Moral causes," next after " Religion," appears a heading " Infidelity," to which two cases are ascribed. The heading is very vague, for it appears from former reports that the supposed cause of insanity thus referred to is infidelity of a wife. A similarly incorrect heading is noticed to statement IV in the appendix, which at present runs : " Table showing the occupation of several patients during 1884-85." It is evident that what the table is intended to show is the previous occupations of the patients admitted during 1884-85. A little additional care would prevent the occur- rence of such inaccuracies. 1882-83 .. .. .. .. 30.00 1883-84 .. .. .. .. 44.95 1884-85 .. .. .. .. 42.52 5. The percentage of recoveries to admissions during the last three years is given in the margin. Although lower than in 1883-84, the number of recoveries during the year under report was still satisfactory. As usual, the highest ratio of recoveries was to be found among patients suffering from acute mania, while chronic dementia appears to be the least hopeful form of disease. The report does not mention the ages of those who recovered, but the great bulk of the recoveries is found among patients who have been less than two years in the asylums. The highest percentage of recovery occurred in the asylum at Calicut. 6. The death and sick rates continued to be satisfactory, though the former was a little higher (6.71 per cent.) than in 1883-84, when the rate was as low as 5.05 per cent. of average daily strength. The sick rate remained unaltered at 5 per cent. of the daily strength. The heaviest death rate is shown by the Waltair returns, but the population of the asylum is very small, and the percentage of mortality is easily raised by the reception of a few patients in bad health. In the Waltair Asylum, every patient who was discharged as cured during the year had gained in weight since entering the asylum, while at Calicut of the total number of inmates, 79 had gained in weight, 7 remained in statu quo, and 28 had lost weight. The figures of weighment are not given in the report of the Madras Asylum. This omission should be supplied in future. 7. The report states that the total outlay on the three asylums during the year amounted to Rs. 1,06,566 against Rs. 1,09,289 in 1883-84, but the cash accounts of the asylum (statement IX) shows that, notwithstanding the remarks of the Govern- ment on the report for 1883-84, the figures in columns 25 and 26 are still shown as part of the actual expenditure in the asylums. The attention of the Surgeon-General is directed to this matter in view to a correct form of account being furnished next year. The actual outlay on the three institutions was as follows :( 47 ) 8. On the whole the working of the asylums was satisfactory. No changes were made in the mode of treatment, but fresh industries were added to the employment of the patients. One escape occurred from the Madras Asylum, and the attempts to recapture the lunatic failed. The Superintendents' reports of the working of their subordinate staffs are satisfactory. (True Extract.)

OFFICE OF SURGEON-GENERAL WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF MADRAS, OOTACAMUND, 28th June, 1886. No. 0-199. From G. BIDIE, ESQ., M.B., C.I.E., Ag. Surgeon-General with the Government of Madras, To THE HON. E. F. WEBSTER, Chief Secretary to Government, Judicial Department. SIR, G.O., Judicial Department, No. 20, Miscellaneous, of 5th January 1886. I HAVE the honor to submit to the Right Honorable the Governor in Council reports on the Lunatic Asylums in the Presidency, for the nine months ending 31st December, 1885. The change in the periods embraced in the reports is due to the marginally noted order of Government, which alters the purview from the official to the calendar year. This change will prevent any rigid comparison between the results under notice and those of previous reports. 2. GENERAL RESULTS.4 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. Caste. Males. Females. Total.

The number of European and Eurasian admissions, 23, is larger in proportion to the existing population of these classes. Of the total number received, 135 were males and 44 females. This result is not in accordance with the experience of English asylums, where insanity is nearly as common amongst women as men, and the disparity here is probably largely due to social conditions which may prevent females being sent to a public institution. 6. AGES OF PATIENTS ON ADMISSION.ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 5 Out of 220 instances, in which causes were assigned, 155 were of a physical and 65 of a moral nature. The comparative infrequency of moral causes is probably to some extent due to the incompetency of the reporters to discern and appreciate such influences. Of all known physical causes the abuse of narcotic drugs was the most common, and next to that hereditary tendency and epilepsy. In 16 instances the attacks are ascribed to starvation or privation, and in 5 to intemperance. Of moral causes the most frequent were grief, family quarrels, religion (possibly "false belief" should come under this head), fear and loss of property. If the probable causes of insanity were more commonly reported in this country they would afford scope for interesting comparison and discussion; but like many other incidents connected with domestic native life we only come to learn them, in most cases, as it were by accident. 8.

Weaving is carried on in the criminal enclosure; four English looms are at work, an average of 15 yards of cloth daily being woven. It furnishes a variety of occupations suited to the powers of the different patients, such as spinning, winding, starching of thread, filling of spindles, &c. Two tailors cut out the cloth, which is made up by the female patients, assisted by the tailors and a sewing machine. The washing is now done entirely in machines purchased by Dr. Dobie from Messrs. Bradford and Co., London, and is a great improvement on the old dhobie system, the wear and tear of the clothes being reduced to a minimum. A great saving is also effected. The large machine is used for all the clothing and bedding of the male patients, and washes 30 pieces in a quarter of an hour. A warder and six patients are told off for the work, which is very easily learned by any one. The small machine is worked by the female patients, and is capable of washing 10 or 15 pieces in a quarter of an hour. By a little care and attention to the instructions given, the clothes are washed very clean, and it is astonishing the amount of pleasure and appreciation shown by the inmates at the result. Gardening is productive of much good amongst the inmates. Vegetables required for the diets are supplied to the contractor; cocoanuts, tamarind, lucerne and grass sold, and the proceeds used to decorate the grounds with shrubs, evergreens, and crotons, the planting and care of which are entrusted to patients who interest themselves in the work. A few patients assist at the cook-room and in carrying round food, others sweeping and cleaning the grounds. A carpenter's and blacksmith's shed have been erected near the office and one or two inmates found to be excellent workmen.

I.ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 27 The following table showing the number remained, discharged, died, &c., (civil and criminal lunatics) during nine months is hereto annexed:28 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. (f.) Amongst 18 recoveries, 11 were from mania (being the more prevalent type of insanity), 6 from dementia and 1 from paralysis insanorum. All cases of discharged " cured" have gained in weight. One amongst them was peculiarly noteworthy. He was admitted in a " very bad" state of health and I never thought that he would rally. He used to bleat like a goat and move like a quadruped. He was very much afraid of people approaching him and would cry in a very pitiable manner. He was a lad of 18 years old, named Koru, about 4 feet 7 inches high, small head, and a projecting chin. The alleged cause was said to be starvation. There was no apparent improvement for a year or until he gained 30 lb. in weight, then he showed symptoms of mental improvement in proportion to the bodily improvement. After an increase of 40 lb. some mental improvement was observable, 50 lb. a decided improvement, and 55¼ lb. or when he weighed 124½ lb., he became perfectly sane, and was discharged " cured." (g.) Of the 18 discharged " cured," 11 were below one year, 6 below two years, and 1 below three years, and the alleged cause of insanity was not known in any one of the cases. (h.) One remaining " cured."ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 29 endeavours to feed him were utterly useless. He would never take conjee, broth, milk or any other liquid; as for medicines he would not take a drop. Enema and stomach pump were found to be of no use. After three months' duration in the hospital, he died of ulceration of the bowels, which was proved by post-mortem examination. No. 4.30 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. Name. Weight at the Name.

The figures relating to the age of the patients admitted show, as usual, over 70 per cent. of the cases to be those of persons in the prime of life between 20 and 40 years of age, when, as remarked by the Surgeon-General, the strain on the mental organization is heaviest. As regards the causes of insanity, little definite information is afforded. Out of 727 cases, 507 are returned as of causes unknown. The most frequent physical causes are the use of narcotic drugs, child-birth, and epilepsy, and these may be regarded as really being important factors in the causation of lunacy. The moral causes are much less reliableANNUAL REPORT ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN THE MADRAS PRESIDENCY FOR THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 1886. MADRAS: PRINTED BY R. HILL, AT THE GOVERNMENT PRESS. 1887.

The percentage of recoveries to admission contrasts very favorably with the results in previous years, viz., 73.29 against 32.40 in the previous nine months, and 42.52 and 44.95 in 1884-85 and 1883-84, respectively. The Surgeon-General's attention will be drawn to paragraph 6 of G.O., No. 2816, dated 18th October 1886, as the absence of comment on these figures is again observed in the present report. 6. The number of patients in hospital was not as large as the number in the previous nine months, but the mortality was greater, 33 deaths having occurred against 27 in the previous period. The percentage of deaths to the daily average strength was 5.60 against 4.64, and to total admissions 20.49 against 15.08. These rates are very high, and the Government further observe that, taking the Madras Asylum alone, the mortality was much higher still, being over 69 per mille of the average strength. It is true that 13 deaths out of 29 were due to meningitis, but it is observed that as many as 10 deaths (23 per mille) occurred from pulmonary disease alone. These figures call for the Surgeon-General's attention. One case of small-pox, which terminated fatally, occurred in the Calicut Asylum, but this was the only casualty of the year there.

OFFICE OF SURGEON-GENERAL WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF MADRAS, OOTACAMUND, 31st July 1888. No. 0/386. From G. BIDIE, ESQ., M.B., C.I.E., Surgeon-General with the Government of Madras, Ootacamund, To THE CHIEF SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Judicial Department, Ootacamund. SIR, I HAVE the honor to lay before the Right Honorable the Governor in Council a report and statistics, showing the working of the three Lunatic Asylums in the Madras Presidency in the. year 1887. 2. GENERAL RESULTS.4 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. The daily average strength of insanes shows a notable increase over that of 1886 in all three institutions, and the daily average number of sick was also larger, except at Calicut. The deaths in 1887 were in Madras and Calicut more numerous than in 1886, but fewer in the Vizagapatam Asylum. The chief cases of inter- current ailments and the causes of mortality amongst the insanes will be noticed further on. The rates per cent. of recoveries and deaths to average strength and admissions were more favorable than in 1886 in the Vizagapatam Asylum, but less so in the two others. Calicut, however, shows the lowest death-rate, viz., 3.39 per cent. of daily average strength. 4. The subjoined statement contrasts the general results in the three insti- tutions for the entire asylum population in 1887, with the averages of the ten preceding years:ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 5 several ascertained causes which were believed to have produced mental aber- ration:6 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. absent even in the most serious cases. Amongst the causes leading to its pre- valence and great fatality in Madras may be included the privations to which most of the patients are subjected prior to admission. Thirteen deaths resulted from diseases of the nervous system, the most prominent amongst these being apoplexy (4), general paralysis of insane (2) and meningitis (3). Seven deaths were due to bowel-complaints, viz., 5 to dysentery and 2 to diarrhANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 7 substitution of a First-class Hospital Assistant for a Warrant Officer at Vizaga- patam. The proportion of warders to patients was as usual 1 to 6. 15. The Madras Asylum was carefully inspected by me, and so was that of Calicut. In both I found the patients well attended to and the general arrange- ments and working of the institutions satisfactory. I also visited the Vizagapatam institution, but owing to the irregularity of the steamers on the east coast was unable to inspect it without great loss of time. 16. The usual industries were carried on and amusements provided for the patients. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, G.

The figures relating to the sex, race, and age of the patients admitted do not exhibit any very noticeable features. The proportion of females was, however, exceptionally small as shown by the figures in the margin, and the number of Native Christians was lower than for several years past. As usual, three- fourths of the lunatics admitted were between the ages of 20 and 40. Seven persons under twenty years of age were received and only two over sixty. 4. The increase in admissions occurred entirely at the Calicut asylum, where 44 insanes were received in 1887 against 9 in 1886. Of these 23 belonged to the Mala- bar district and 6 to South Canara as compared with six and one, respectively, in the previous year. No explanation of the sudden rise appears and it will be referred to the Collectors concerned for remarks. It seems probable that it is due to greater activity on the part of the police in arresting wandering and possibly harmless luna- tics( 27 ) 3.83 in Vizagapatam and 3.39 in Calicut, were very moderate. In the former institution in particular, there has been a marked improvement in the rate of mortality during the last six years, and the average annual number of deaths since 1881-82 has been only three. In a small asylum, however, a very small number of casualties materially affect the death-rate. 1885 (9 months). 1886. 1887. RS. A. P. RS. A. P. RS. A. P.

The health of the Vizagapatam Asylum was extremely good during the year, for though the daily average sick rose from 0.92 in the previous year to 3.72, there were only 11 admissions to hospital and one death against 20 admissions and 2 deaths in 1887. The large increase in the daily average sick is explained by the fact that 2 female insanes were under treatment in hospital, one for general debility and the other for heart disease, for very long periods. The death-rate in this asylum is the lowest since 1882-83, and in proportion to the daily average strength the lowest for the last eleven years. Of a total number of 61 insanes treated during the year, 3 recovered, 2 improved, 1 died, and 55 remained in the asylum at the end of the year. In the Calicut Asylum the daily average sick was 3.08 and the death-rate 4.07 per cent. of daily average strength. These figures are higher than the correspond- ing ones for last year, and in the case of daily average sick above the average for the last ten years. The more serious ailments treated were dysentery (16), simple continued fever (8), and diarrhAPPENDIX.

( 25 ) GOVERNMENT OF MADRAS. JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT. READ( 26 ) 1881-82. The question of the best manner of providing increased accommodation in all three asylums is now under the consideration of Government, and the Surgeon- General should expedite the submission of his reply to G.O., 16th July 1889, No. 1215. It is observed that the figures of capacity of each asylum appended to Statement I in the report differ from those supplied in the monthly accommodation returns, and the Government desires to be informed of the reason for this difference. At Waltair, admissions numbered 9 against a five-years' average of 12.8, and at Calicut 29 against a similar average of 33.6. Total popu- lation.

Owing to the smaller admissions, the aggregate of patients dealt with during the year slightly diminished, but the daily average population was considerably higher than in 1887 or preceding years. The figures are shown in the margin. This rise in average number of inmates seems to have been partly caused by the smaller number cured and otherwise dis- charged during 1888. Sixty-one patients were cured, as compared with 73 in 1887 and 118 in 1886, the decrease occurring in the Madras asylum, where the number of cures in the year under report amounted only to 38, against a five-years' average of 60. As observed by the Surgeon-General with the Government, the decrease is not satisfactory, but the proportion of cures varies so considerably from year to year, and must depend so largely on the character of disease met with, that no certain conclusion can be drawn from the decrease. It is probable, moreover, that the smaller number of admissions tended to reduce the proportion of cures, long-standing cases being less hopeful than recent ones. ( 27 ) ( 28 ) Monthly cost per head.

OFFICE OF SURGEON-GENERAL WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF MADRAS, FORT SAINT GEORGE,14th August 1890. No. 641. From W. F. DE FABECK, ESQ., M.D., Surgeon-General with the Government of Madras, To THE CHIEF SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Judicial Department. SIR, I HAVE the honor to submit, for the information of the Right Honorable the Governor in Council, the annual report and statistics showing the working of the three asylums in the Madras Presidency for the year 1889. 2. GENERAL RESULTS.4 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. The daily average sick in the three asylums was as follows : ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 5 strength is strained to the utmost in the battle of life, and to the fact that both the physical and moral causes that tend to produce insanity are most frequently met with at this age. It is also very probable that insanes under 20 years of age are, in a considerable number of cases, taken care of by their relatives. The comparatively small number of admissions over and above 40 is due to the decrement of the general population at this age and which is more marked among insanes, their mean age being less than among the rest of the population. 7. TYPES OF INSANITY.6 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. lunacy were ascertained only in 390 cases, while in the remaining 402 cases the causes were unknown, because of the special difficulties existing in India in tracing out the previous history of insane persons, not the least of which is that a large number of them are wanderers from their homes uncared for by their relatives and are picked up by the police and sent to asylumsANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 7 The only asylum that shows any increase in the monthly average cost is Waltair; but this increase is more than counterbalanced by the decrease in the Madras and Calicut asylums. 10. The particulars of the establishments of the three asylums and their costs during the year are given in table X appended to the report, according to which there is a slight falling off in the monthly cost during 1889, owing to the reduction effected in the number of keepers. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, W. F. DE FABECK, M.D., Surgeon-General with the Government of Madras.

This will be apparent from the marginally-noted figures. If the statistics in respect of cures are to be trusted, the results of treatment in the Madras asylums would seem to be more successful than those obtained even in England, for, while the Madras asylums show as cured 42.05 per cent. of the total admissions during the decade ending 1889, the corresponding proportion in the English asylums for the ten years ending 1888 is only 39.91* per cent. There is little doubt that the apparent superiority of the Madras asylums is due partly to the greater caution exercised in England in regard to release and partly to the larger number of cases of toxic insanity( 29 ) in regard to the preparation of Statement VI, presumably on account of the difficulty of re-classification at so late a date. From this statement it appears that out of 792 patients treated, no fewer than 455, or 57.4 per cent., were suffering from dementia. The next largest group was formed by persons afflicted with mania; these num- bered 199, or 25.1 per cent. of the total. Among the larger groups, the rate of curen varied from 11.5 per cent. in the case of mania to 3 per cent. in epileptic insanity; particulars appear in the margin. 9. In the following table the patients treated are classified with reference to the more important causes of insanity :( 30 ) report " Debauchery," which signifies much the same as " Dissipation," is also viewed as a physical cause ; this classification seems to call for amendment. It is manifest, moreover, that such a head as " Congenital" affords information of the type, rather than the cause, of insanity, and that the boundary between it and the head " Here- dity " must be very ill-defined. 10. From Statement IX it appears that there was again a decline in the cost of maintaining the lunatic asylums during the year under review. Taking the totals of columns 16, 29, 30 and 31 of the above-mentioned statement, the actual cost seems to have amounted to Rs. 83,562, against Rs. 86,463 in 1888 and Rs. 88,249 in 1887 ; the cause of the decrease in 1889 has not been stated and is not obvious. Local and Municipal bodies were relieved of all contribution towards lunatics in Government asylums from the 1st April 1889, and there was consequently a very large decline in the receipts from that source. The percentage of expenditure from the treasury on the principal items of charge to the total expenditure from the treasury appears in the following table:ANNUAL REPORT ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN THE MADRAS PRESIDENCY FOR THE YEAR 1890.

OFFICE OF SURGEON-GENERAL WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF MADRAS, OOTACAMUND, 28th May 1891. No. 368. From W. F. DE FABECK, ESQ., M.D., Surgeon-General with the Government of Madras, Ootacamund, To THE CHIEF SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Judicial Department. SIR, I HAVE the honour to forward, for the information of the Right Honourable the Governor in Council, the annual report on the Lunatic Asylums in the Madras Presidency for the year 1890. 2. ACCOMODATION.4 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. population is found to correspond with an increased number of lunatics. In this country, however, the admissions into lunatic asylums afford no accurate index of the amount of insanity prevailing amongst the civil population : the higher caste Hindus are much averse to their relatives being confined in public institu- tions, where they may have to associate with others of lower caste. There are (it may reasonably be expected) doubtless a large number of insanes amongst the native population, who are kept under restraint in private houses, and of whom the Police authorities have no knowledge. Making all allowances for caste prejudices, it is, however, a remarkable fact that the lunatic statistics in this Presi- dency do not exhibit a more marked increase in the number of insanes amongst the native population for the last ten years. Of the total number under treatment during the year 625 were males and 204 females, showing that there has been an increase in the number of lunatics of both sexes as compared with 1889. The total number discharged was 118, of whom 86 were males and 32 females. Of the total number discharged 64 are returned as cured, 37 were transferred to the care of friends, and 17 discharged otherwise. There were 114 deaths during the year. The following table shows the chief results in each of the three asylums for the last three years :ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 5 Taking the asylums separately, the mortality was highest in Calicut (19.4) and lowest in Waltair (11.3); the death-rate in Madras (18.8) was higher than it has been for several years. In addition to the large number of deaths from cholera the mortality from diarrh6 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 134 no information could be obtained as to the antecedents of the patients. An investigation into the causes of insanity in this country is involved in difficulties, but I feel confident that more satisfactory results would be obtained than are apparent in this report if greater care were taken by local authorities to examine into the previous history and antecedents of each particular case before sending the lunatic to an asylum. I have drawn the attention of Medical officers up- country to this subject, and directed them to take care to find out as much as they possibly can of the previous family history and antecedents of the lunatics they may be called upon to examine. The Medical officers in charge of the asylums have, in the majority of cases, nothing to guide them in forming an opinion, except the written documents which accompany the insanes, and, if these are carelessly filled up, the difficulties in forming an opinion as to the causes of insanity are greatly increased. 10. In reviewing the annual report for 1889, exception was taken to certain sub-divisions adopted in statement VII under the two main heads " Physical causes " and " Moral causes " ; this year " Foreign service " has been omitted as a cause of insanity, and " dissipation " has been classified as a physical cause. As regards the terms "congenital" and " hereditary" I desire to point out that, though the former undoubtedly affords information in respect to the type of insanity, it cannot be excluded from the causes which tend to produce insanity; as, for instance, in those cases where mental incapacity is due to congenital abnormal conditions of the bones of the skull: in such cases the brain, though it may have attained the size natural at birth, is prevented from further development by the too early ossification of the bones of the skull, and closing of the sutures. Insanity due to arrested development of the brain from this cause is manifestly very different from the hereditary forms which may not appear till middle life or even old age. There is a well defined difference between congenital and hereditary conditions, a tumour inside the skull may be a congenital cause of insanity, but need not necessarily be hereditary. 11.

In 1888 and 1889 also, the excessively high death-rate among the women confined in the Madras Lunatic Asylum attracted atten- tion, and the continuance of this abnormal mortality during the year under review suggests some serious defect with regard to the management of this class of patients which calls for early remedy. In paragraph 3 of his report for 1889, the Surgeon- General alluded to two possible causes for unhealthiness in the Madras Asylum; of these one was a contaminated water-supply and the other the defective drainage of the female enclosure. The former defect has, the Surgeon-General reports, been remedied, but it is not clear whether any steps have been taken to improve the drainage. The matter should now receive immediate and careful attention. State- ment I also shows that the proportion of inmates on the sick-list was, as in 1880, far higher in the Madras Asylum than in the others. This is the more noticeable as the Surgeon-General has recently reported that the hospital accommodation in this asylum is insufficient( 31 ) Percentage to total treated of cases ascribed to an unknown cause. Madras .. .. .. .. 58.2 Panjáb .. .. .. .. 53.4 Bombay .. .. .. .. 50.6 Bengal .. .. .. .. 48.6 It is observable from these figures that great differences exist between the results obtained in the various asylums, those shown against Madras being almost invariably the best and those for Calicut the worst. The fact that the cause of insanity was not discovered in 75 and 76 per cent. of the cases treated in Waltair and Calicut, respectively, suggests a want of attention to the subject on the part of the Superinten- dents concerned. It is, however, observed that the Surgeon-General has drawn the attention of all District Medical Officers to the necessity of making full enquiries as to the cause of insanity in all cases which come under them for treatment. The figures in the margin show that the results obtained in the Madras Presidency in the investigation of the causes of insanity were inferior to those achieved in the other provinces in the year under review. In view of the explanation now offered by the Surgeon-General in paragraph 10 of his report, the headings of the two sub-divisions referred to by him under the main head " Physical causes " in Statement VII should be altered from " Congenital" and "Hereditary " to " Congenital defect " and " Hereditary taint." 6. Below appear details of the outlay per head of daily average strength upon each of the main items of expenditure during the last three years :( 32 ) the average cost of feeding each native patient in the Madras Asylum should be given in the body of the report; it is presumed that there will be no difficulty in elimina- ting the particulars relating to the rationing of Europeans and Eurasians from those referring to the native population. A comparison is instituted below between the cost per head of diet and the death-rate in the Madras asylums and those in other Presi- dencies, and it will be observed that elsewhere economy has been secured without any ill-effect upon the health of the patients:( 33 ) Statement XI do not exactly agree with those denoting the daily average strength in Statement I; the reason for the difference should be explained. There is still, however, room for improvement in the Madras asylums. For example, there is no reason why Bengal should be able to employ 77.7 per cent. of its asylum population on industries while in Madras the corresponding figure is only 45.8 per cent., nor is there any appa- rent cause why the average earnings per head in the Madras Presidency should amount to only Rs. 11-10-0 while in Bombay they reach Rs. 13-3-0. These facts are accen- tuated by the differences existing between the various asylums under this Govern- ment ; thus, in Calicut the average earnings amounted to Rs. 20 per head of those employed, while in Madras the corresponding figure was Rs. 13-5-0 and in Waltair only As. 14. No reason has been given for these large variations; the matter should now be explained. The extension of the manufacturing department is desirable, not only from an economical point of view, but also as a means of occupying the attention of the patients. 8. On the whole, the administration of the Lunatic Asylums during the year cannot be regarded as altogether satisfactory ; in many respects the results obtained were inferior to those of 1889, and from some points of view the asylums in this Presidency do not compare favourably with those elsewhere.

SIR, I HAVE the honour to forward, for the Information of the Right Honorable the Governor in Council, the annual report on the Lunatic Asylums in the Madras Presidency for the year 1891. 2.

As already reported to the Government I had several hydrants permanently closed, and the others are used at fixed hours only. The old wells, except the one in the female enclosure, have been opened and used for gardening. The Consulting Architect reports that he was unable to cut off the supply and use well water (as I suggested), as the use of pipe water formed part of the contract and that the value would subsequently be deducted from the contractors' bills and credited to Government. 5.

There has been since then an improvement in this relative mortality until in the year under review, the death-rate among females was less than on the male side. The number of cases treated in the other asylums are too small to allow of any deductions being drawn from them. Table showing percentage of sick to total population in Madras Lunatic Asylum.

" As regards the large number of recoveries from dementia, I give them as derived from the returns of 1891 when I was not in charge of the asylum. Possibly they were cases of acute dementia which is very rare but curable, whereas chronic dementia, the common form, is not. Some misapprehension may have been caused by so many of the admission forms having the disease entered as dementia by medical officers and others who have not made a special study of insanity." As in the previous year epileptic insanity shows the largest percentage of deaths. The small proportion of recoveries under this form of insanity will also be notedANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 9 IX-A.10 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. not included in the average daily sick rate, but their condition necessitated a liberal diet on preventive principles. A proper record of the convalescents, or, as they were formerly called " weakly gang," waas not kept up in former years, but there is no doubt that the average daily strength of this class for 1891, viz., 63, is far higher than in previous years. This class of inmates, when suffering from any specific complaint and under observation for 36 hours, were entered in the returns as hospital admissions, but by far the largest number were those, merely in bad health, who were dieted and had special attention paid to them generally. If all this class of persons were admitted into hospital, the accommodation would have to be increased enormously : this is not necessary as the asylum is practically a hospital. With the object of showing fluctuations in diet from this cause, I have directed a register to be kept up of all those not alone on the convalescent gang, but all others who may receive from any cause an excess of the sanctioned scale. In this matter of dieting sickly lunatics, particularly in unhealthy years, much latitude must, I think, be allowed to the Superintendent. Dr. Dobie remarks when called on for explanation on this point that " the giving of extras is a necessity in all asylums where lunatics are treated as patients and not as criminals." He further quotes his recent observations in English asylums; he says, " I found the pauper inmates of the Hampshire County Asylum better fed than the majority of paying patients at a large private institution." As I quote Dr. Dobie in several places, I may here remark that he has made this branch of medicine a special study and has more experience of lunatics and lunatic asylums than any other officer of the department. It was, however, observed by Government in reviewing last year's report that in other provinces economy has been secured without any ill-effect on the health of the patients and supported this statement by a comparison made of the death-rate and cost per head of diet in the Madras asylums with those in other Presidencies, but with due deference I do not think it possible to draw any conclusions from such a comparison. I have found it impossible to draw any deductions from a comparison of the diet scales of one Presidency and another ; the bases of the diet and the price of grain are so dissimilar that it is very nearly as difficult to draw a comparison between the cost of feeding an insane in the Punjab and Madras as between the Punjab and England. The same remark holds true of the death-rate. The circumstances of climate under which the insanes are placed are different; they are differently affected by diseases and their temperaments practically differ. Dr. Dobie in this connection reports from his personal experience that in the late campaign at Suakim he found the Punjabees living on a diet which was so insufficient for the Madras troops and followers that the latter had to be given a meat ration in order to combat disease against which he had warned the authori- ties three months before it broke out. The above remarks fully explain the cause of the increase under dieting, and, at the same time, throw some further light on the general subject of dieting lunatics in this Presidency. According to the diet sanctioned in G.O., No. 1307, of 30th July 1889, the cost of a European diet, according to current market rates, amounts to 4 annas 3 pies, that of a native 2 annas 8 pies ; this is exclusive of all extras. The annual cost of an insane during 1891, including Europeans and natives and extra diets, is Rs. 72-9-9 or 3 annas 2 pies per diet; from this it will be seen that the cost of dieting is not excessive. The present scale cannot be considered at all too liberal, and I am of opinion that no reduction can be made in it. It must be kept in view that the most import- ant factor in the treatment of insanes is a wholesome and liberal diet to make up for the great nervous and general waste of tissue that occurs in their cases, and this apart from the generally bad condition they are in, on arrival, at the asylum. In last year's review the cost of feeding an insane in Bengal was Rs. 35-13-0, that is, 1 anna 7 pies per diet. I am sure Government will see that it would be im- possible to feed insanes of this Presidency on this sum, and it is not to be forgotten that the Madras rate includes Europeans.
ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 11 The average monthly cost of feeding a European inmate was Rs. 10-3-5, and a native Rs. 4-12-11 ; these are the averages for four months commencing September 1891, that is, after the receipt of orders of Government on this point; prior to this, although the accounts were in a manner kept separate, they are not sufficiently accurate to admit of the average for the year being calculated from them. I would here refer to a cause of fluctuation in dieting lunatics which I think has not been before referred to. Certain lunatics have to have their whims as to diet humoured either to keep them alive or to induce them to work. Regarding these insanes, Dr. Dobie reports as follows :12 ANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. large increase under manufactures, Rs. 5,370-11-10, is, as will be seen later on, due to some extent to the faultiness of Form XIANNUAL REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 13 XI-A.APPENDIX.

GOVERNMENT OF MADRAS. JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT READ2 8TH JUNE 1892, No. 1075, JUDICIAL. by the Superintendent to the rapidity with which death or recovery supervened in many instances. The explanation cannot be accepted. It is understood that the hospital accommodation in the Madras Asylum is now sufficient for all needs, and the coincidence of a low sick rate with high mortality raises a doubt whether the medical supervision which should ensure that cases are brought sufficiently early under treatment is adequate. The matter will be further considered in connection with the special report of the Sanitary Board which is now with the Surgeon-General. Dr. deFabeck will have seen from G.O., dated 27th April 1892, No. 807, Judicial, that the Government is prepared to take into consideration proposals for strengthening the staff of attendants in the Asylums. 3. The great decline in the proportion of patients whose previous occupation was declared on admission to be unknown is satisfactory, and it is still more gratifying to observe the large advance in the percentage of admissions in respect of which the cause of insanity was traced; this latter proportion was 79.34 per cent., being the highest figure reached in the last five years. As remarked by the Surgeon-General, it is interesting to observe how few cases of insanity are attributed to the use of opium. 4. The outlay per head of daily average strength on account of establishment was much the same in 1891 as in 1890. The charges per head of daily average strength during the last four years under the other items of expenditure is shown below :8TH JUNE 1892, No. 1075, JUDICIAL. 3 dieting at Calicut in the space of three years shows that there has been waste in the past. The diet scale at these Asylums is the same as at Madras. It appears to the Governor in Council that the administration of the Madras Asylum demands the closest supervision by the Surgeon-General. He should report his authority for the state- ment that indulgences in the form of extra food as rewards for work are debitable to '' Manufactures "; the arrangement seems an unsuitable one. With reference to his remarks in paragraph 12 (b) of the report, the Surgeon-General has apparently lost sight of the fact that gingelly and cocoanut oil have been substituted for ghee in the case of native patients by G.O., dated 30th July 1889, No. 1307, Judicial. The average cost of dieting non-paying patients in each Asylum should be given separately in the body of the report every year, in order that Government may be in a better position to compare the outlay in the various institutions. 5.
