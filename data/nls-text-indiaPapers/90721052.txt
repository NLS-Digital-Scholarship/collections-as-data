History. Before the year 1867, Vaccination was carried on in this Province under what is usually termed the Dispensary system. 2. Towards the close of that year a regular Vaccine Department was established under the Superintendence of Dr. G. S. Sutherland, the Sanitary Commissioner. 3. For the first three years the operations were confined to the city of Lucknow. 4. In his report for 1869-70, Dr. Sutherland recommended that attempts might be made to extend the benefits of vaccination by posting one operator to each of the civil stations. 5. This was done in 1870-71, and the success attending the measure induced me to recommend in my last Annual Report, that two Vaccinators should be sent to each district, one to work in the Sadr station, and the other to accompany the camp of the Deputy Commissioner when on his cold weather tour. 6. The Chief Commissioner desired that twenty-four extra Vaccina- tors should be entertained, two for each district, to be paid from Local Funds, one of whom was to proceed with the Deputy Commissioner's camp, and the other with that of the Settlement Officer or Assistant Commis- sioner as the case might be. One Vaccinator was also to be posted at each Sadr station as before. Advantage of Vaccinators going with Deputy Commis- sioner on tour. 7. In the last report it was shewn that the people held most extra- ordinary opinions about vaccination, and often refused to believe that the Vaccinator was a Government servant, or that he was other than an adventurer. He was sometimes even attacked and maltreated. There- fore this method was devised. Twenty-four Vaccinators were distributed throughout the Province under the orders of Magistrates, and it was seen that the Vaccinators had the sanction of Government. Many of the Civil Officers took great trouble to explain to T'alukdárs and others, the advantages of vaccination and their efforts were productive of good results. Disadvantages of the same. 8. The disadvantages of the travelling system of vaccination are, difficulty of observing the results of the operations, and of getting fresh supplies of lymph. How obviated. 9. Both these objections were obviated by some officers who allowed the Vaccinators to remain at any place where the people were favourably disposed or permitted them to go back to their former places of operation to see the results, and to replenish their stores of lymph.
( 2 ) Talisíl vaccination recom mended for future adoption 10. On the whole our object was attained and the path has been cleared for the future. The results of the season were fair, but at the same time I am inclined to think that now with the hearty co-operation of all Civil Officers both European and Native, Vaccinators stationed at Tahsíls, would do better work, and certainly they could be more easily supervised by the Inspectors. Aid given by Deputy Commissioner Rái Barelí; 11. In Rái Barelí the Deputy Commissioner posted the Vaccinators in each of the Tahsíls from the beginning and allowed them to work almost throughout the season in the Tahsíls and their vicinity. He took much interest in the cause of vaccination and explained its benefits to the people. 12. He issued parwánas to the Tahsíldárs to render all reasonable assistance to the Vaccinators. and by the Deputy Com- missioner of Sítápur. 13. In Sítápur, for the greater portion of the season, the two Vaccinators were allowed to work with the Deputy Commissioner's camp and did very good work. Mr. Anderson stated that in some villages every child had been vaccinated. Such results show how important is the personal influence of the Deputy Commissioner. Progress in Bára Banki very satisfactory. 14. In Bára Banki also vaccination made much progress through the interest evinced by the District Officers. 15. During an outbreak of small pox numbers of people in Bára Banki are said of their own accord to have brought their children to be vaccinated. I saw about 130 cases of recent and successful vaccination while at Bára Banki in February. Good example set by Thá- kúr Bharat Singh. 16. The Civil Surgeon of Hardui observes that Thákúr Bharat Singh recognized vaccination by permitting the heir to his property to be subjected to the operation, and that his having done so was due to the persuasion of the Deputy Commissioner whose action was rendered effectual by the presence of a Vaccinator in camp. Assistance given by T'a- lukdár of Mulliabád and Tahsíldár. 17. Nawáb Ahmed Khán T'alukdár of Mulliabád having had personal experience of the benefits of vaccination as alluded to in last year's report, requested in the early part of October to have two Vacci- nators posted to Mulliabád. This was agreed to, and I am glad to state the men did much good work through the assistance they received from the T'alukdár and from the Tahsíldár of Mulliabád, Pundit Kálí Pargás. and by Hydar Ali of Rasulpur. 18. In the beginning of November Hydar Alí Lamberdár of Rasulpur, a village about 12 miles from Lucknow, asked for the services of one Vaccinator to work on his estates. He set a good example by first allowing his own children to be operated on. The consequence of this and of his persuasion was that many people readily permitted their children to be vaccinated. Also by Darogah Mír Wa- jid Alí, and Hakím Mozuffer Hussein Khan. 19. Darogáh Mír Wajid Alí and Hakím Mozuffer Hussein Khán of the Unání Hospital gave us great assistance in persuading the inhabitants of their villages near Lucknow to receive the benefits of vaccination.
( 3 ) Also by Abúl Hassan, Tah- síldár of Birhar, by the T'alukdárs of Akberpur and the Zemindár of Oosuroo. 20. In the Faizabad district Abul Hussan Tahsíldár of Birhar, Jugeshur Upadhya Zemindár of Oosuroo, Bákar and Mozuffer Hussein Talukdárs of Akbarpur and the relatives of the late Máhárájah Maun Singh rendered much assistance to the Vaccinators. Rája Amir Hussein Khán of Mahmudabad, the Rájah of Bhinga and the late Chaudhari Hushmat Ali lent their help. 21. Raja Amir Hussein Khan of Mahmudabád in Sítápur, the Rájah of Bhingá in Bharaich and the late Chaudharí Hushmut Alí of Sandila took as before, much interest in vaccination. Vaccination better received in Gonda and Unáo, but not generally elsewhere as yet. 22. The Civil Surgeons of Gonda and Unáo report that vaccin- ation was more acceptable than hitherto to the people of those districts but generally the vaccinators were received with the same degree of repugnance as before. 23. No doubt the example set by influential native gentlemen is producing an effect, and a little more perseverance on our part will be crowned with success. Apathy of the Tahsíldár of Mohunlálganj. 24. The Deputy Superintendent of Vaccination reports that the Tahsíldár of Mohanlálganj gave very little or no assistance to the Vaccinators posted in his Tahsíl, notwithstanding the instructions of the Deputy Commissioner. Distribution of Vaccina- tors. 25. The Vaccinators paid by Government were disposed of in the following way:( 4 ) Primary and secondary. 30. Of the total number, 36,513 were primary, and 1,150 secondary operations. Sex. 31. Of the primary operations, 22,086 were on males, and 14,427 on females. Caste or religion. 32. The castes of the patients were:( 5 ) former had usually the countenance, and assistance of the officers whom they followed in camp. Reasons. 45. The percentage of unknown results in the operations of the Sadr establishment was 6.12 while that in the operations of the district establishment was 9.87. This is to be explained by the movement of the latter in camp. It was especially high in the district of Faizabad and Pratábgarh, viz., 21.45 and 20.33 respectively, i. e., in those districts where the Vaccinators were probably not allowed to go back to note results but had to march frequently. Extra Vaccinator at Unáo and his work. 46. In addition to the two Vaccinators sanctioned for each district, there was another entertained at Unáo and paid from Local Funds. 47. Statement V. shews that the total number of persons vaccinat- ed by him was 438, of which 28 were secondary and 410 primary ; of the latter 380 were successful, 25 unsuccessful or doubtful, and the result of 5 was &quot;unknown.&quot; 48. In no other place were any other Vaccinators employed except those sent from the head-quarters. Native Superintendents. 49. Besides the two native Superintendents of the regular estab- lishment, two others were temporarily engaged and paid from miscella- neous contingencies. Each of them was put in charge of three districts, where they constantly went round and examined the work of the Vaccin- atcrs comparing it with the registers which they furnished. Not sufficient. 50. There should have been at least one Native Superintendent to each district as it is not possible for one man to properly look after more. 51. Throughout the district of Lucknow the work was specially supervised by the Deputy Superintendent. Cost of the establishment. 52. The cost of the regular establishment including contingencies amounted to Rs. 5,309-1-0, and the charges on the Local Fund amount to Rs. 1,237-1-6 in all Rs. 6,546-2-6. Cost of each successful Case. 53. The cost of each successful case was three annas nine pies only or nearly half that of the preceding year. Conclusion. 54. I was generally much pleased with the quality of the vaccina- tion I saw in the Sadr stations and villages during my cold weather tour, and with the conduct of the establishment in general. 55. I have already mentioned the names of influential men whose assistance was willingly given, and I beg to recommend them to the ap- probation of the Chief Commissioner. J. C. WHISHAW, Offg.
