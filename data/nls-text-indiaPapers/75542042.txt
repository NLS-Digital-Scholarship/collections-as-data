REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE FOR THE YEAR 1923-24 [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] PESHAWAR : K.-W.F. P. GOVT. PTG. & STY. OFFICE PESHAWAR. 1924.
Proceedings of the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner and Agent to the Governor-General, North-West Frontier Province, No. 577-Rev., dated the 13th August 1924. READ( 2 ) have either been transferred to other districts in the Province or auctioned. But the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, has a scheme for re-opening these veterinary hospitals and proposes to run them by means of private aid. This scheme is under consideration and will be given a trial. Similarly in the Dera Ismail Khan District the veterinary hospitals at Tank and Chaudhwan have also been closed and the bulls have been sold or lent to persons who can undertake the cost of their keep and permit the public to use their services. 5. During the year no new bulls were purchased and some of the old stock died. The Nili buffalo-bulls are much liked by the people and there is much scope for improvement in the Peshawar, Hazara and Bannu Districts, where buffalo- cows are found in a large number. But the financial state of the District Boards in the Province is not flourishing, and nothing can be done towards the improvement of buffalo- breeding until the situation becomes easier and the District Boards are in a better position to provide funds for the purpose. As pointed out last year the same remark applies to the proposals of the Superintendent for purchasing more Merino rams for the Hazara District. Of the 4 Merino rams purchased during the year for the Dera Ismail Khan District two died owing to excessive heat and the remaining 2 were transferred to the Kaghan Valley in the Hazara District. 6. As noted in the last year's review it has again been found impossible to create a separate Civil Veterinary Department with a whole-time Superintendent in charge. 7. In conclusion, the Chief Commissioner is pleased to acknowledge the good work done by the Superintendent and his staff during the year. ORDER.ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE, FOR THE YEAR 1923-24. PART I.-GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. Officer in charge. 1. Mr. J. S. GAREWAL remained in charge of the North-West Frontier Province as well as the North Punjab circles up to 31st January 1924 (afternoon) when he handed over charge to Mr. M. J. Brett. Extent and duration of tour. 2. Mr. Garewal toured for 56 days in connection with the work of North Punjab circle and 37 days in connection with that of North- West Frontier circle. He travelled 617 miles by road and 3,745 miles by rail in the former and 587 miles by road and 1,926 by rail in the latter circle. The average of his touring in both the circles comes to 10.3 days in a month. Mr. M. J. Brett toured 32 days in North Punjab and 12 days in North-West Frontier circle. He travelled 153 miles by road and 2,459 miles by rail in Punjab and 88 miles by road and 750 miles by rail in the North-West Frontier circle. The monthly average of his touring comes to 11.0 days. Work performed on tour. 3. The following veterinary hospitals were inspected by the Superintendents once and some more than once during the year under report :( 2 ) The following tonga lines also were inspected with a view to the detection of contagious or infectious diseases among the equines as well as to note the general condition of these animals :( 3 ) As usual, during his tour, the Superintendent interviewed the district officers regarding veterinary matters and inspected all the Government and District Board stallions and most of the bulls in the Province. PART II.( 4 ) SECTION 1-B.( 5 ) SECTION 1-C( 6 ) Buildings. 22. The following additions and alterations are required in the Veterinary Hospital buildings in the North-West Frontier Province :( 7 ) named districts are well liked by the Zamindars. I am of opinion that 4 buffalo-bulls of the Nili-breed should be purchased by the Peshawar District Board and 2 by Hazara District Board. Sheep and goat breeding. 25. Six Merino rams working in Hazara District in the previous year have all died but 3 bachas (¾ bred) of these are still work- ing in Mansehra and in Abbottabad Tahsils. Merino rams are much appreciated but the number available is quite insufficient. At least 10 Merino rams of purest breed should be purchased for Kaghan Valley and 15 (3/4 bred) rams may be located in Mansehra and Abbottabad Tahsils. Ten Pusht-i-Koh rams which may be obtained from Tarnab Cattle Farm and 10 Michniwal dumbas are also required for the Peshawar District. Four Merino rams were purchased this year by Dera Ismail Khan District. But owing to the excessive heat 2 of them died and the remaining 2 had to be sent to Kaghan Valley. Two cross-bred Merino rams may be purchased by the District Board and kept on trial to ascertain whether they would be suitable to the locality. The localities where sheep breeding operations could be carried on with advantage are Nowshera and Charsadda Tahsils in Peshawar District and Abbottabad and Mansehra Tahsils in Hazara District. The wool of Dumbi sheep which are found mostly in Nowshera and Charsadda Tahsils is thick and hard and sold at two seers per rupee. The wool of the sheep in Hazara District which is finer is chiefly used for making pattis and blankets and sold at Re. 1 per seer. Montgomery bulls. 26. No new bull was purchased by any of the district or agencies of the Province during the year under report. There are 3 working in Bannu District and 2 in Dera Ismail Khan. SECTION 2.( 8 ) The following distribution of stallions took place in the districts named :( 9 ) SECTION 4.( 10 ) veterinary hospitals in the district (except one at head- quarters) was arrived at, at the commencement of the year under report. Like Hazara District only one Chaukidar was retained by the District Board at each of those hospitals where the Veterinary Assistants are endeavouring to carry on the work with the instruments that are available and the medicines which the well-to-do zamindars can afford to buy for the treatment of their sick animals. The closing of the hospitals and the great difficulty in maintaining those mentioned above, without the necessary staff and financial help, must undoubtedly have a very dis- couraging effect on the Zamindars of the districts concerned towards the breeding of both horse and cattle ( 11 ) To carry on the work of the Civil Veterinary Depart- ment effectively in the Frontier Province the following extra staff should be sanctioned and the pay of the Veterinary Inspectors and Veterinary Assistants brought to an equal basis with those of the same standing in the Punjab :( 12 ) The Superintendent takes this opportunity of expressing his thanks to District Officers for the help given to him and his staff in carrying out their duties.

READ( 2 ) expenditure upon education and in other directions, there appears to be little prospects of much increase in the matter of veterinary activity in the near future unless further financial assistance is forthcoming from the Central Government in connection with the recently proclaimed policy of additional attention to the fundamental interests of the agricultural community. The whole question of the possibility of increasing the veterinary staff is, however, being re-examined. The building requirements of the Department will also be brought to the special notice of the District Boards concerned. It is gratifying to note that in spite of the decrease from 18 to 16 in the number of Veterinary Hospitals, the number of animals treated increased from 46,258 to 48,929, while medicine was supplied for a further 3,800 cases which could not be brought to hospital. Veterinary Assistants visited 16,873 villages and treated 41,317 animals, in each case a considerable increase over the figure of the previous year. Castrations showed a most gratifying increase from 17,098 to 28,652 and the desirability of further extending the use of the Burdizzo castrator is commended to the notice of all Deputy Commissioners. The Chief Commissioner is fully alive to the desirability of encouraging horse-breeding in the North-West Frontier Province and towards the close of the year under review the Government of India sanctioned an annual grant of Rs. 2,500 for such races at the Peshawar and Rawalpindi meetings as are likely to further the objects in view. In conclusion, the Chief Commissioner desires to acknowledge the valuable work done by Mr. J. Brett who was in charge of the Department throughout the year and tenders his thanks to Mr. T. J. Egan for his stimulating report and energetic advocacy of the needs of his Depart- ment. T. B. COPELAND, Revenue Secretary to the Chief Commissioner, North-West Frontier Province.
ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE, FOR THE YEAR 1924-25. PART I.( 2 ) The following tonga lines were inspected with a view to the detection of contagious or infectious diseases among equines and to note the general condition of the horses plying there:( 3 ) PART II.( 4 ) Rinderpest. 11. 1,782 cases and 805 deaths against 525 cases and 375 deaths in the previous year. Preventive inoculation.( 5 ) SECTION 1-C.( 6 ) Buildings 24. The following additions and alterations are very urgently required in the veterinary buildings in the North- West Frontier Province:( 7 ) Buffalo-bulls. 26. As last year no buffalo-bulls were purchased during the year under report. There were 12 buffalo-bulls in all at the commence- ment of the year. Two died (1 in Hazara and 1 in Peshawar District) during the year, leaving a balance of 10 bullalo-bulls working in the Province on 31st March 1925. There are no well bred buffalo-bulls kept by the District Board in Dera Ismail Khan District though buffalo-cows are found in large numbers in such villages as Roda, Jhok Jamal, Jhok Ladhu, Jhok Khalranwali, Lar Rangpur, Kalagar, Awan, Band Karai and Khiran. More buffalo-bulls should be located in Bannu District. The buffalo-bulls of Nili breed already working there are greatly appreciated. As noted in last year's report, 4 buffalo-bulls of this breed should be purchased by the Peshawar District Board and 2 by Hazara District. Sheep and goat breeding. 27. Three (3/4 bred) Merino rams were located in Mansehra and Abbottabad Tahsils at the commencement of the year. One of them died on 28th September 1924, thus leaving 2 rams standing in Hazara District on 31st March 1925. There are 3 rams in Peshawar District ( 8 ) One Arab horse stallion was made over by Bannu District Board to Nawab Khan Bahadur Zaffar Khan of Wali. There were 13 donkey stallions working in the Province at the end of the year under report against 14 stallions working at the end of the previous year. One country bred donkey stallion was made over to Malakand Agency by the District Board, Peshawar, and 1 similar donkey was sold this year by Malakand Agency. Service of stallions.( 9 ) Training of local men in the Punjab Veterinary College. 33. No local men were sent for training to the Punjab Veterinary College, Lahore, during the year under report by any of the Districts and Agencies in the North- West Frontier Province. SECTION 5.( 10 ) To carry on the work of Civil Veterinary Department effectively in the Frontier Province the following new staff should be sanctioned:( 11 ) I would like to draw the attention of the District Boards to the question of horse-breeding in the Province. All interest towards this important work seems to be dying out at present, I consider conditions are ideal for horse and mule breeding at such places as Peshawar, Mardan, Charsadda, Bannu, Kohat, Dera Ismail Khan, etc. The zamindars are also very keen and all that is necessary is that the District Boards concerned would come forward with necessary financial support to maintain this important industry. The Superintendent takes this opportunity of expressing his thanks to the District Officers for the help given by them to him and his staff in carrying out their work. T. J.

Government of India Publications are obtainable from the Government of India Central Publication Branch, 8, Hastings Street, Calcutta, and from the following Agents:Proceedings of the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner and Agent to the Governor-General, North-West Frontier Province, No. 1235-Rev., dated the 14th September 1926. READ ( 2 ) Surra was rife in the Malakand Agency and accounted for 31 deaths out of 46 cases reported during the year. Amongst bovines 9,355 cases were reported of which 2,575 proved fatal as compared with 1,477 out of 23,518 cases last year. Rinderpest prevailed throughout the Province and alone accounted for 2,191 deaths out of the total number of 5,162 cases reported during the year. The Superintendent again complains that patwaris are slack in reporting outbreaks of contagious diseases. The Chief Commissioner trusts that the scheme of granting rewards to patwaris for the prompt reporting of such diseases, which was introduced in this Province during the year under review, will have the desired effect 3. The number of Veterinary Hospitals in use was the same as in the year previous, viz. 16, but the number of cases treated in these institutions increased from 48,929 to 50,606. The number of castrations performed in the hospitals rose from 3,797 to 4,411. The figures in regard to castrations are remarkable and of special importance in as much as they show the great awakening of the zamindars to the necessity of improving the breed of their cattle and of the value of castration as a means to this end. Mr. Egan and his staff are to be congratulated on the results achieved. 4. The Superintendent recommends additions to certain existing buildings. These requirements all seem necessary and are brought to the special notice of the District Boards concerned and should be carried out where possible. 5. It is regretted that owing to financial stringency it was not found possible to increase the number of stallions. The number remained almost the same as in the year previous. The Superintendent's remarks in paragraph 35 of his report regarding mule-breeding and the revival of annual Cattle Fairs, are brought to the special notice of the District Boards, and the Chief Commissioner hopes that they will receive due attention. 6 The numerical strength of the staff employed in the North West Frontier Province remained unaltered. 7. In conclusion the Chief Commissioner is pleased to acknowledge the good work done during the year by Mr, T. J. Egan and his staff.

REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT NORTH WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE FOR THE YEAR 1926-27 CALCUTTA : GOVERNMENT OF INDIA CENTRAL PUBLICATION BRANCH 1927
Government of India Publications are obtainable from the Government of India Central Publication Branch 3, Government Place, West, Calcutta, and from the following Agents :Proceedings of the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner and Agent to the Governor-Generti, North West Frontier Province, No. 932-Revenue, dated 27 September 1927. READ 2 disease which as usual were not often actually fatal. The figures are 3 Frontier Province as compared with the neighbouring six districts of the North Punjab Circle. The fact must, however, be faced that the Veterinary Department has unfortunately so far been unable to convince the agricultural population of the Frontier Province of its great potentialities in enhancing their wealth, and the Chief Commissioner can only hope that with the gradual spread of education and the inauguration of the co-operative movement, the District Boards will at no distant date realize their short-sightedness in declining to raise by increased taxation the additional funds which alone will enable the activities of the Veterinary Department to be expanded to any appreciable extent. 6. The Chief Commissioner desires to acknowledge the valuable work done by Mr. T. J. Egan, and tenders his thanks to Mr. S. M. A. Shah for his interesting and lucid report. Mr. Shah is, however, inclined to forget that an annual report is concerned with the past and is hardly the place for specific recommendations with regard to the future. ORDER.ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, NORTH WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE, FOR THE YEAR 1926-27 PART I-GENERAL ADMINISTRA- TION. 1. Charge2 3. Work performed on tour3 inspected during journeys on tour and several cases of non-contagious disease sent to the nearest veterinary hospital. The Superintendent personally checked the work of the veterinary staff on tour, that is, inoculation work and work relating to the general treatment of disease. Certain surprise visits were also paid to the veterinary hospitals in order to oversee and ascertain whether or not veterinary officials were properly cognisant of the real sense of their duties and were performing them efficiently and creditably. The Superintendent inspected Government stallions, District Board stallions, and stud bulls working in the Province and had official interviews with several district officers regarding veterinary matters. He also interviewed several prominent zamindars of different districts in the Province and advised them on various points of veterinary interest. PART II-TREATMENT OF DISEASES.

As regards other diseases the lack of sera and vaccine stands in the way of their proper control. It is worthy of note that sera and vaccine worth more than Rs. 18,000 were used in the six districts comprised in North Punjab Circle while Rs. 6,000 only were available for whole of the North West Frontier Province. Similarly the comparative meagreness of veterinary establishment stands greatly in the way of preventive veterinary campaign. There are only two inspectors and 21 veterinary assistants working in this circle as against six veterinary inspectors and 55 veterinary assistants working in the neighbouring circle of North Punjab Similarly the number of veterinary hospitals in North Punjab Circle (45) stands in marked comparison with the small number (18) working in Frontier Province It is time that proper attention may be paid towards these questions of vital veterinary interests. A province mainly agricultural should not stand as an isolated example of backward tendencies, particularly in respect of agriculture and veterinary matters. There should be veterinary hospitals at every important village or centre and necessary establishment should be sanctioned. Two veterinary inspectors are quite insufficient for the requirements of such a large Province and their number should be augmented at an early date. The position of this circle as regards cattle-breeding also stands on a very unsatisfactory basis. The interest of the District Boards seems to be on wane with the consequence that the number of stud bulls is dwindling down fast. I recommend that there should be a Deputy Superin- tendent in sub-charge of this circle as is the case in North Punjab Circle and that there should bean inspector in charge of each district in the Province. There should be at least a dozen veterinary assistants working in each district of the Province, then the campaign against contagious diseases of animals can be carried out more effectively and efficiently. One must not forget the fact that in neighbouring province of Afghanistan there is no veterinary supervision and that the intercourse of animal dealers of this Province and that of Afghanistan and the mixing of animals of the two provinces through the Khyber Pass is a source of great danger to this Province as far as loss to the Province from contagious diseases is concerned.
13 I am confident most of the contagious disease is imported from Afghanistan. In North Punjab Circle which is almost as big as the Frontier Province and where this particular danger does not exist the veterinary establishment is three times that of the Frontier Province. It is requested that the augmentation of the establish- ment may now be seriously considered. Cattle-breeding operations in the Province are parti- cularly negligible. To meet the demands of agricultural population of the Province and to prevent further deterio- ration of stock, I request all the District Boards in the Province to be generous over this question which is so vitally important for an agricultural country particularly for the North West Frontier Province where the sole occupation of the inhabitants is agriculture and good plough bullocks are badly needed. The grievance of District Boards that the bulls given to zamindars for breeding purposes are not well kept is sound and genuine. To overcome this difficulty and from the long experience of cattle-breeding in North Punjab Circle the Department is of opinion that the best method to improve cattle-breeding industry in North Punjab is to subsidise privately-owned good bulls upto the standard approved by the Civil Veterinary Department for breeding. The owners of such bulls are paid a subsidy which I recommend for the North West Frontier Province upto Rs. 15 per month per bull for the feed and keep of the bull on the condition that the bull is well looked after by the owner and that his service is available free to all zamindars of the ilaqa in which he is located. Time to time these bulls are inspected by officers of the Department and reported upon, any bull in poor condi- tion or unfit for service is discharged and another good one engaged in his place. This system is really sound because it requires no initial heavy inlay in way of purchase price and the fact that the subsidy of the animal can at any time be stopped makes the owner all the more alert about his animal and the animal is well looked after. This system is more effective and economical than purchasing bulls and locating them in different villages.
14 I recommend all District Boards in the Province to start with ten bulls each in the coming year and locate them at suitable centres. I have submitted a similar scheme to District Board, Peshawar, and I hope it will meet their approval. Ten bulls working in a district means an average expenditure of Rs. 120 per month. The number of bulls suggested by me is, I know, quite inadequate for the needs of such a vast Province but still a start will be made in the right direction and in years to come their number may gradually be increased till their number is adequate for the needs of the agrarian population of the Province. To improve cattle-breeding industry in a country it is also necessary that from time to time really good stock should be exhibited and prizes in way of encouragement given to them. Exhibition of good animals creates a stimulus in zamindars who visit these shows and creates in them a desire to keep good animals and is an effective object lesson for all the zamindars of the ilaqa in which the show is held. I strongly recommend to all District Boards in the Province to revive all cattle fairs and augment their number. The horse-breeding industry in the Province has improved considerably but I regret mule-breeding is not getting much encouragement or support from Government. Only 13 donkey stallions are at the stud for the whole of the Province, a number which is too small for any effective improvement in mule-breeding industry. This is a very important industry and a source of great revenue to the poorer people who have always been very keen on mule- breeding. I would request all District Boards in the Province to be broad-minded over this important question and to come forward with all their support. Patwaris are still backward in reporting outbreaks of contagious diseases in their ilaqas. The death-rate would certainly be considerably reduced if patwaris were more efficient in that branch of their duties. Thanks of Superintendent are due to head clerk, Mehta Shiv Dutta, who inspite of the twofold work of North West Frontier Province and North Punjab Circle discharged his duties efficiently and to the entire satisfaction of the Superintendent. As his duty is of a double nature more than he can be expected to discharge, I strongly
15 recommend that an allowance of Rs. 50 per month be sanctioned for him by the North West Frontier Province Government. Superintendent takes this opportunity of expressing his thanks to all district officers for help given to him and his staff in carrying out their duties. S. M. A.

Sheep and goat breeding- No great attention is still being paid towards sheep and goat breeding which offers good opportunities in the Nowshera and Charsadda tahsils of the Peshawar District and the Mansehra and Abbottabad tahsils of Hazara District. Some good stock can now be seen in certain portions of the Province, such as Mansehra Tahsil, Tarnab Farm, the Abbottabad Tahsil, and the Nowshera, Mardan and Charsadda tahsils of the Peshawar District, the produce of rams located in these parts in years gone by. The Mansehra and Abbottabad tahsils are best suited for sheep and goat breeding. 27. Montgomery bulls- There were four Montgomery bulls on 1 April 1927, two of them working in Dera Ismail Khan and two in Bannu. One was purchased during the year by Kohat Municipality, making the total number at the end of the year under report five. SECTION II-EQUINES. 28.

11 employed at stud during the year, against 12 horse and one pony stallions employed in the previous year. They covered 601 and 65 mares respectively, against 584 and 56 covered last year. The average covering comes to 46.2 and 65, against 48.6 and 56 of the previous year. Thirteen donkeys remained at the stud during the year, although their number was augmented to 15 towards the close of year. These covered 541 mares, against 531 last year. The average covering comes to 45.08, against 40.8 last year. SECTION III-FAIRS AND SHOWS. 30. Tables XIII and XIV12 GENERAL REMARKS. 34. Glanders has been particularly prevalent in Peshawar District. It has been ascertained that practically all cases of glanders are due to Tribal Territory and Afghanistan where no adequate veterinary supervision exists. To suppress the disease in the Province the creation of a veterinary inspection post at Jamrud or at Landi Khana has been proposed but is unfortunately difficult owing to political considerations. A great source of danger as far as bovines of this Province are concerned is the importation of emaciated, debilitated, diseased, and in fact the refuse stock of the Punjab. In order to safeguard the health both of animals and human beings in the Peshawar District the creation of a veterinary inspection post at Khairabad, to my mind, seems desirable. I have addressed the Deputy Commissioner, Peshawar, on the subject. Rinderpest disease was very severe in Tank Sub-Division, being imported from Tribal Territory. An extensive inoculation campaign was carried out in this sub-division to suppress the outbreak as it was feared that it would spread all over the Province. During this campaign the budget allotment for purchase of sera and vaccine was exhausted, but an extra grant of Rs. 7,000 was sanctioned and the outbreak was brought well under control. Much propaganda work was done in connection with the improvement of live-stock in this Province. District boards which had adopted an indifferent attitude towards veterinary matters in the past few years have begun to realize their short-sightedness and various schemes for improvement of live-stock are now received sympathetically. Revival of the Horse Show and Cattle Fair, Kohat, and handsome contributions of various district boards for purchase of stud bulls are healthy signs of improvement. A scheme for grants-in-aid to district boards for cattle- breeding similar to that adopted in the Punjab has been submitted for sanction. The subsidy system of cattle-breeding, referred to by me in last year's report, has now been approved by the Hazara and Peshawar districts and given a start. The problem

13 of supply of pure milk and ghee is becoming daily more acute in the large towns of the Province. Various sugges- tions to overcome this difficulty have from time to time been addressed to the municipalities and notified areas in the Province and stud bulls of high milk strain have been supplied to some municipalities. Patwaris still continue to be slack in reporting outbreaks of contagious diseases in their ilaqas. The horse-breeding industry has improved. Work performed in veterinary hospitals shows a marked increase over that of last year. Castration work was specially pushed on during the year as it is only by castrating undesirable males that progress in improvement of cattle can be expected. Absence of residence and office accommodation has been a source of inconvenience to the Superintendent. Rent of Rs. 150 per mensem was very kindly sanctioned by Revenue Commissioner but owing to shortage of houses no house was available to rent. I think if a house in Peshawar Cantonment is acquired on a rough cost of Rs. 15,000 it will serve both purposes. Superintendent takes this opportunity of expressing thanks to all district officers for help given to him and his staff in carrying out their duties. S. M. A.

Government of India Publications are obtainable from the Government of India Central Publication Branch, 3, Government Place, West, Calcutta, and from the following agents :Proceeedings of the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner and Agent to the Governor-General, North West Frontier Province, No. 1357-Revenue, dated 10 December 1929. READ2 3. The number of veterinary hospitals was eighteen as before. During the year, however, thirty four touring dispensaries were started to bring veterinery aid to areas at a distance from the veterinary hospitals. These dispensa- ries are open once a week and managed by the Veterinary Assistant in charge of the nearest hospitals. The paucity of the veterinary Staff however severely limits their scope and an increase of personnel is needed to make the scheme really effective. The number of cases treated in hospitals and dis- pensaries increased from 63,266, to 68,169, while medicine was supplied in 5,462 cases which could not be brought to hospitals. The number of castrations performed amounted to 10,162 or 1,949 more than the last year. 4. The scheme to improve the condition of cattle in this Province by the importation of stud bulls of the well known Dhanni Breed referred to in paragraph 5 of the last year's review has been sanctioned by the Government of India and introduced during the year under report. A good start has been made in cattle breeding both in raising the number of herd bulls and in carrying out propaganda among zamindars to induce them to use good bulls for herd purposes. It is satisfactory to be able to note that there are now 89 bulls at stud in the Province, the largest number reached since the establishment of the Department in the year 1901 and a large advance on the 26 bulls at stud before the introduction of the scheme. All the bulls now working are imported from the Dhanni tract in the Punjab. The District Boards recognise the importance of the scheme and a sum of Rs. 7,000 was contributed by them for the purpose. The Chief Commissioner will be interested to receive further information regarding the success of this movement in future reports. 5. The replacement of stallions and the figures of their services again show a small increase over the last year's figure. 6. The proposal to s end two stipendiary students to the Punjab Veterinary College for a higher education course, referred to in last year's review, has since been sanctioned by the Government of India, and carried into effect. The new post of Veterinary Assistant Surgeon sanctioned
3 in the year was filled up by promotion from amongst the existing Staff. 7. The Superintendent recommends additions to cer- tain existing buildings. These requirements are brought to the special notice of the District Boards concerned, and should be carried out where possible. 8. The numerical strength of the staff employed in, the North West Frontier Province, remained unaltered except that one post of Veterinary Assistant Surgeon was sanctioned by the Government of India during the year. 9. In conclusion the Chief Commissioner is pleased to acknowledge the good work done during the year by Mr. S. M. A. Shah and his staff. ORDER.ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, NORTH WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE, FOR THE YEAR 1928=29 PART I GENERAL ADMINISTRA- TION. 1. Charge- Mr. S. M. A. Shah was in charge of the Department throughtout the year. 2. Extent and duration of Officer's tour2 cattle imported from the Punjab viâ Khairabad and camels of Powindahs coming from Afghanistan during cold months were examined with a view to detect rinderpest in the former and surra in the latter. Work of the recently introduced subsidy cattle breed- ing scheme was seriously looked after in Peshawar and Hazara Districts, and the Superintendent checked the work done by the staff while on tour, that is, inoculation, castra- tion and general treatment of diseases. Three Arab horse stallions were bought during the year at Bombay and three donkey stallions were purchased from the Government Cattle Farm, Hissar. The Dhanni tract in the Punjab was visited for selection of suitable stud bulls, and the Jehangir-Abad Cattle Farm for selection of Montgomery bulls. Judging and classification at three important horse shows and cattle fairs in the Province viz. Bannu, Haripur and Dera Ismail Khan, were conducted and the temporary dispensaries set up at the fairs were inspected by the Superintendent. Live-stock in many out lying villages and in the numerous weekly cattle fairs held in the Province were inspected on the spot, investigation into the prevalence of cattle diseases were carried out and inoculation checked. Several unreported cases were discovered and immediate action was taken. The Superintendent also toured in Waziristan. During the year under report Veterinary Inspector M. Ghulam Qadir held charge of the Peshawar, and Veterinary Inspector S. Ali Akbar Shah of the Derajat, Sub-Division. SECTION I-CONTAGIOUS DISEASES. 4. Mortality3 live-stock of the Province although foot and mouth disease was fairly wide-spread. Fortunately rinderpest took a milder course this year than last. Rinderpest has waves of virulence from time to time which take three to four years to reach their crest. There is however reason to believe that the figures in the table are very far from revealing the true state of affairs. It is probable that the deaths from epidemic diseases are much more numerous than those reported, and the loss by death is only a small part of the loss the cultivator suffers from this cause. Hæmorrhagic septicæmia is a fatal disease. The percentage of death from rinderpest is fairly high, though the averge mortality, which fluctuates widely, may not be more than 30 per cent, the remaining 70 per cent are enfeebled by disease. Similarly in the case of foot and mouth disease for one animal that dies, ninety nine may be temporarily incapacitated. There is much unnecessary loss of cattle owing to delay in reporting, and many outbreaks which cause heavy mor- tality might be mitigated or even prevented if prompt information were given to the nearest veterinary officer. Had the patwaris sent their reports at once it can be held with confidence that the number of deaths would have been further reduced. 5. Pathological Specimens4 under the Glanders and Farcy Act. Rs. 80 were awarded as compensation under the Act. Last year's amount was Rs. 80. Glanders is a highly contagious equine disease, com- municable to human beings which generally ends in death. So in the interest of humanity it is highly desirable to wipe out the disease altogether from the Province. The figures quoted above can by no means be regarded as reliable and represent only those obvious clinical cases brought to hospitals for treatment and there diagnosed and treated under the Glanders and Farcy Act. There is any amount of glanders in villages and towns of North West Frontier Province for which thorough search is needed. 8. Surra- Five cases were reported in the Peshawar District. The disease was confirmed by microscopic examination. Necessary precautions were adopted to stop the spread of the disease. Surra generally occurs in lowlying areas subject to periodic inundations and is communicated from animal to animal through the agency of biting flies. The worst Surra zone in the Province is Tank Sub-Division where cases of surra have always been reported in Frontier Constabulary horses. This year the Superintendent pres- cribed measures for the suppression of the disease and supervised their execution. During the year not a single case or death from this disease occurred among Frontier Constabulary horses located at Tank. 9. Dourine, Anthrax and other contagious diseases- Three cases of other contagious disease were reported from Peshawar District. Nature of the disease could not be diagnosed as the report was submitted late and on arrival of Veterinary Assistant disease was all over. Precautionery measures were however prescribed. SECTION I-B-BOVINE CONTAGIOUS DISEASES. 10. Mortality-table II5 Notwithstanding the marked increase in the number of cases, it is satisfactory to note an appreciable falling off in the number of deaths. 11. Rinderpest6 13. Foot and-mouth disease7 died of the disease. It is of interest to note the progress that has been made at the Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research, Muktesar, in ascertaining the types of organism responsible for this disease in India. " It would seem that the type commonly responsible for actual outbreaks in India is bacillus chauvaei, while the so called malignant 8 21. Rabies- Forty cases of rabies were reported during the year under report. Fourteen brains were sent to the Pasteur Institute, Kasuli, for examination and report: eleven proved positive. During the year the following members of the sub- ordinate and menial establishment of the department were sent for anti-rabic treatment :9 Veterinary Hospital, Peshawar City, for treatment during the spring, at which season it is chiefly prevalent. Graded intravanous injections of navarsenobin were tried which proved useful. Fifty per cent. cases which were brought for treatment in the early stages of the disease were found to recover by this treatment. Further investigation on this line of treatment will be carried out next spring. 24. Canine Typhus- Several cases of the disease were treated successfully at Civil Veterinary Hospital, Peshawar City. 25. Fowl cholera- Cases of the disease occurred now and again at the Poultry Farms, Tarnab and Parachinar. Progress of the disease on each occasion was checked by segregation and thorough disinfection. 26. Fowl Diphtheria10 30. Criminal poisoning11 (2) Nowshera Hospital12 Frontier Province on 1 April 1928 was 26. During the year there was an increase of 77 bulls and decrease of 14. The total number at the end of the year under report was 89. This number is a record for the province, the highest figure so far achieved having been 56 in the year 1921-22. Every effort is being made to castrate unsuitable sires working in the province and to advise District Boards and Municipal Committees to entertain good bulls for breeding purposes. Cattle breeding has made satisfactory progress though more bulls in all the districts of the Frontier Province are badly required. In the cattle fairs held in the province, and during his tour in different villages, the superintendent saw hundreds of very good calves by District Board bulls. Comparisons of young stock from District Board bulls and other bulls were made at demonstrations given on cattle breeding at several places and zamindars were shown the good points in calves obtain- ed from district board bulls. This had a very good effect as good use of the bulls for covering purpose was made by zamindars and there was a great demand for more bulls. 35. Buffaloe breeding- There are fifteen buffaloe bulls at stud in the Province. There are thousands of very fine buffaloe-cows in Pesha- war valley but the quality of buffaloe bulls as far as milk strain is concerned is very poor. People have begun to realize the importance of buffaloe as dairy-animals and import good buffaloe cows at fancy price from Punjab but the milking qualities are lost in the next generation as suitable sires with the reputation of high milk strain are not available in Peshawar Valley. According to the recent Settlement Report of Peshawar District the number of buffaloes in the valley has increased which is probably due to reduction of pastures making the zamindars bread buffaloes which can be stallfed. 36. Sheep and Goat breeding- Sheep and goat in this province are of a superior quality to those in the adjoining province of Punjab. Hangu and Mansehra sub-divisions are ideal for sheep and goat breeding. Great improvement can be made in local breeds by breeding by selection and scientific mating. If a pro- vincial farm in Mansehra sub-division is started to carry out researches in the local breeds with a view to develop mutton
13 and wool of sheep and goat, it will materially increase the prosperity and welfare of thousands of people who live entirely on sheep breeding in this province. 37. Montgomery Bulls- There were five Montgomery bulls on 1 April 1928, two of them working in Bannu, two in Dera Ismail Khan and one at Kohat. During the year under report one died and two were purchased by Municipal Committee Peshawar, and one by Haripur so making total at the end of year seven. The number of good milch-cows in large towns of the province is considerable and it is desirable to increase the number of sires of a good milk-bearing strain. SECTION II-EQUINES. 38. Number of Stallions.14 SECTION IV-SUBORDINAAE STAFF. 41. Numerical Strength15 were carried out in Civil Veterinary Hospital, Peshawar City. A great increase in the number of cases treated is a convincing evidence of the popularity of our hospitals with the zamindars of this province. Many zamindars in several tracts cannot possibly utilize the services of present hospitals on account of long long distances and to meet their require- ments the idea of increasing these institutions will be welcomed by them. A marked feature of the year's report is the satisfactory progress made in cattle breeding operations. Record figure of 89 bulls against 26 last year has been achieved. It cannot be said that we have solved the problem but a move- ment in the right direction has been made. During the year characters of Miranzai, Mansehra and Daman sheep were studied with a view to work up flocks of their breeds by selection and scientific mating. As funds are available these schemes will be given a practical shape. Funds have been provided by District Board Kohat for this particular work. With a view to supply pure and wholesome milk and in order to propagate western hygienic ideas on the subject, a scheme has been drafted to start a model dairy at Bannu financed by the Municipality. Horse and mule breeding operations show an increase over last year's figures. A buffaloe bull and a Dhanni bull were located in Civil Veterinary hospital, Parachinar, with a view to improve the indigenous breed of cattle and buffaloes in Kurram Agency. Scheme to open a Civil Veterinary hospital at Miran Shah in North Waziristan and at Sararogha in South Waziristan have been drafted and submitted for sanction. The work of the subordinate Veterinary staff was on the whole satisfactory with a few exceptions. M. Ghulam Qadir, Veterinary Inspector, Peshawar division, did valuable work in the office in addition to his own duties and his services in this connection are gratefully acknowledged. Work of M. Sarfaraz Khan as in-charge of Civil Veterinary hospital, Peshawar City, deserves special mention. The Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner awarded him a silver watch for services rendered to the Government house.
16 The Superintendent wishes to express his thanks to all District Officers for the help given by them to him and his staff in carrying out their duties. S. M. A.

READ2 year. During the year under review six more touring dispensaries were started, bringing the total to forty as against thirty-four in the previous year. Veterinary aid to outlying areas was therefore appreciably extended. The number of cases treated in these dispensaries increased from 68,169 to 73,744 while medicine was supplied in 5,109 cases which could not be brought to hospitals. 4. The scheme to improve the breed of cattle in the Province, referred to in paragraph 4 of last year's review, is making satisfactory progress. The main principles followed are the provision of pedigree stud bulls and the elimination, by castration, of unsuitable sires. Of stud bulls there are now 125 as compared with eighty nine in the preceding year. The number of castra- tions performed was 13,142 as against 10,162 in the previous year. The figures for castrations are proof of a gradual awakening on the part of the zamindars to the necessity of improving the breed of their cattle. A further grant of Rs. 7,000 was sanctioned by the Government of India for the cattle-breeding scheme. District boards continue to take a lively interest in this scheme and adequate funds were contributed by them for this purpose. The Chief Commissioner will watch with interest the progress of this movement. 5. The replacement of unfit stallions was not lost sight of, and it is satisfactory to note that the demand for the services of thorough-bred stallions is increasing. 6. The proposal to send three more stipendiary students to the Punjab Veterinary College for a higher educational course was sanctioned by the Government of India and given effect to after the close of the year. 7. The Superintendent recommends additions to certain existing buildings. These requirements all seem necessary and are brought to the special notice of district boards concerned and the Chief Commissioner hopes they will be carried out where possible. 8. The numerical strength of the staff employed in the North West Frontier Province was the same as last year. The question of filling up the vacant post of Deputy Superintendent is now under consideration. A scheme for further expansion of the Department is being worked out.
3 The Chief Commissioner has pleasure in acknowledging the good work done during the year by Mr. S. M. A. Shah and his staff. ORDER.ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, NORTH WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE, FOR THE YEAR 1929-30 PART I-GENERAL ADMINISTRA- TION. 1. Charge2 several operations by way of demonstration to the staff and local residents, at the same time delivering lectures on up-to-date methods of animal treatment. Transport animals and cattle along the main roads were carefully watched with a view to the detection of glanders or other contagious disease. Operations under what is known as the Subsidy Cattle- breeding Scheme continued along correct lines. The Superintendent checked the operative work undertaken by the subordinate staff, with particular reference to inocula- tions and castrations, Two T. B. E. stallions were purchased for the Peshawar and Bannu districts, respectively, under the personal select- ion of the Superintendent. The cattle fairs held at Chakwal and Gujar Khan (in the Punjab) were attended with a view to the selection and purchase of stud bulls for these district boards. The Superintendent also attended the Board of Agriculture meeting held at Pusa during the year, and took part in the discussions of the " Cattle Committee". At the four important horse fairs or cattle shows held at Peshawar, Bannu, Haripur and Dera Ismail Khan, the Superintendent formed one of the Committee for judging and classification. Temporary dispensaries were set up at these shows and did useful work. On all occasions, when at any district headquarters, opportunity was taken of discussing freely with the local officers, Khans and Maliks on matters of veterinary interest. Veterinary inspectors M. Ghulam Qadir (in charge of Peshawar Sub-Division) and S. Ali Akbar Shah (Derajat Sub-Division) put in useful work by attending local district board and municipal meetings in the interests of veteri- nary advancement. On the whole the staff of inspectors and veterinary assistants did well in both practical and demonstrative work with the result that the general zamindar public, hitherto apathetic in matters veterinary, is now awakening to the realities and necessity for veterinary treatment. SECTION I3 per cent. and in deaths by over fifty per cent. Although the year under report was not a particularly unhealthy one, much of this drop in figures must be a resultant of the promptness and activity displayed by all hands. Un- fortunately there are good reasons to believe that all mortality figures are not reported so that an accurate idea of the true extent of disease cannot be gained from the figures now reported. The local patwari is still remiss in reporting occurrences of cattle disease, in spite of the scheme of rewards extant to quicken his labours. This Department is further hampered in the work of preventing the spread of contagious diseases by the absence of rules for the examination of animals imported into India and for the isolation of infected animals. The early in- troduction of regulations to this end is necessary. A large increase in veterinary establishment is also essential to cope with restrictive measures to counteract the spread of disease. The extra expenditure involved would be justified by the saving of valuable cattle that would result. The value of cattle to the people cannot be over-estimated and preventive measures to avoid the loss of valuable stock would appeal to popular imagination and common sense and would not be resented. 5. Pathological specimens 4 Glanders and Farcy Act, Rs. 295 being awarded as com- pensation. Last year's compensation paid was Rs. 80 only. There still remains much to be done before this fell disease is effaced from the Province. It still persists in many villages and towns, and reported cases are practically few which indicates that the dangerous consequences follow- ing it, are not yet appreciated. Only vigorous preventive measures, combined with a publicity campaign, can hope to eradicate the disease. An augmentation of the veterinary staff5 disesase is imported from tribal territory and gradually spreads to the settled districts. With an increased preven- tive Department this danger of infection should be capable of greater control. The efficacy of the "serum alone" method of inocula- tion against rinderpest was commented upon in last year's report. It certainly cannot compare with the "serum- simultaneous " method. However, owing to the expenditure involved and the necessity for better qualified staff in the latter system, it cannot be so extensively used as might be expected. This is much to be regretted, but efforts are being made to gain increased grants of money to this end. 13. Foot-and-mouth disease6 The highest mortality once again took place in the Hazara District. The hope expressed in last year's report, to start vaccination against this disease in the Hazara District, could not be fulfilled owing to want of funds 18. Other contagious diseases7 Three members of the subordinate veterinary staff had to undergo anti-rabic treatment. The fact that ninety-two dogs were vaccinated against rabies as against eighteen last year augurs well for the popularity of this form of treatment. None of the vaccinat- ed dogs developed rabies, With the establishement of a Provincial Veterinary Laboratory this line of humane work will be very fruitful in the near future as the number of valuable dogs in the numerous cantonments in the Province is very high and in the interest of humanity demands the establishment of an anti-rabic treatment centre for dogs on a large scale at all headquarter stations. 22. Distemper8 25. Fowl cholera9 More hospitals are needed10 (3) Abbottabad Veterinary Hospital11 (19) Alizai Veterinary Hospital12 The scheme whereby a Government grant is made to district boards equivalent to the amount subscribed by the boards towards the provision and maintenance of approved stud bulls, is making great progress. Boards have given the scheme their serious consideration and have allotted handsome contributions from their limited funds. The Superintendent visited the Agricultural Station, Tarnab, several times during the year under report to watch the progress of the small herd of Awankari cattle. During the year under report five bulls were purchased from the farm for breading purposes for the Bannu District. The Tarnab herd is too small to meet the stud requirements of the Province. 35. Buffalo-breeding13 under report one died, four were purchased by the District Board, Dera Ismail Khan one by the Municipal Com- mittee, Kohat, and one by the District Board, Peshawar, so making a total at the end of year of twelve. However this number is far short of requirements with the result that owners of good milch cows suffer considerable expense in having to make new purchases to replace progeny in the second and subsequent generations, because of the loss of strain and quality suffered through mating with weak strain bulls. To save the citizens in large towns of the Province from this big loss it is strongly urged on all notified areas and municipalities to provide Montgomery stud bulls in greater numbers.

With the present inadequate staff, it is impossible to quickly suppress contagious diseases or keep them controlled within certain areas. As usual, during the year the veterinary staff were informed by circulars of any matters of professional interest which were considered necessary to keep them up-to date. During the year under report district boards sub- stantially increased their allotments for cattle-breeding. In the Peshawar District the Horse Show and Cattle Fair was revived after ten years. These are healthy signs of improvement. The Superintendent wishes to express his thanks to all district officers for the help given to him and his staff in carrying out their duties. S. M. A.

READ2 production of mutton and wool are of considerable interest as a subsidiary source of revenue to the cultivator. The breeding of ponies and donkeys is still of impor- tance in those parts of the Province where the mountainous nature of the country makes those animals the most useful and often the only means of transport. There are five stipendiary students from the Province at the Punjab Veterinary College, Lahore, and four more scholarships have recently been sanctioned by the Govern- ment of India. The financial situation does not hold out great hopes of large expansion in the Department in the near future; but the Government of India has sanctioned for 1931 four new posts of veterinary assistant surgeons and for the following year a further three posts. This will at least permit the Province to expand in the direction of touring dispensaries, even if for the present such needs as a labora- tory must be held in abeyance. The Government of India has also promised further assistance in the near future in the shape of grants to subsidizing stud bulls. In both these matters therefore substantial, if not rapid, progress can be made. The Chief Commissioner would like to impress on the revenue staff the importance of early reports of contagious disease, and hopes that notice will be taken of cases in which the subordinate staff fails in this duty. In conclusion the Chief Commissioner is pleased to acknowledge the efforts made by the Superintendent and his staff during the year to extend the benefits of their professional skill to the rural population. ORDER.ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, NORTH WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE FOR THE YEAR 1930-31 PART I-GENERAL ADMINISTRA- TION. 1. Charge2 besides he attended some meetings of the district boards and acted as a member of the judging committee at two important horse shows and cattle fairs held at Bannu and Haripur. He also inspected sites and buildings selected for the proposed touring veterinary dispensaries. During his tours the Superintendent inspected all the constabulary lines in the Province, examined horses located in each line and proposed specific treatment for sick animals from time to time. He detected ten cases, viz. nine horses and one camel of surra in Daraban, where a temporary surra centre was started with the result that not a single death took place. During the months of June and July Mr. Shah toured in the Kaghan Valley to investigate the possibilities of encouraging sheep-breeding in the valley. Two donkey stallions were purchased from Hissar for Peshawar District during the year under report. During his short incumbency, the Deputy Superintend- ent, Ch. Ghulam Qadir Khan, attended one important horse show and fair held at Dera Ismail Khan and acted there as a member of the judging committee. During his inspection on tour, the Deputy Superintend- ent observed very carefully the practical work of the veterinary assistants and gave useful advice and instruc- tions. He attended Gujar Khan and Talla-Gang Cattle Fairs with a view to select and purchase suitable bulls for various local bodies in the Province. Fifty bulls were purchased according to the requirments of the Province. Tonga ponies plying on roads for hire were also inspected for glanders and other contagious diseases, and several cases were sent for treatment to the adjacent hospitals. He also attended district board meeting at Peshawar. 4. Mortality3 sixty-two proved positive for different diseases, chiefly for surra and piroplasmosis. SECTION I-A-EQUINE CONTAGIOUS DISEASES. 6. Motality4 SECTION I-B5 Foot-and-mouth disease was very widespread through- out the Province during the year under report, specially in Kohat District and Kurram Agency, though the comparative number of deaths was not so high. Altogether 19,817 animals were affected, resulting only in 184 deaths, as against 7,445 cases and seventy-five deaths during the previous year. 14. Hæmorrhagic septicæmia6 19. Expenditure on sera and vaccine7 disease were chiefly due to the fact that many cases were brought too late for treatment. Fifty-nine dogs were vaccinated. All recovered except nine. 23. Piroplasmosis in dogs8 visited by the staff on tour, against 1,579 last year. Thirty thousand, five hundred and thirty castrations were performed and 56,660 animals treated33.

AGENT IN PALESTINA :Review by the North-West Frontier Province Government (Ministry for Transferred Departments) on the Annual Administration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department for the year 1931-32. 1. This Department is yet small and in urgent need of development on the sound lines. During the year under report there has been development both in its field of opera- tion and the extent of its activities ; but perhaps the most gratifying point lies in the fact that the old apathy and evil hostility with which the activities of the Veterinary Officer were met in the past has now been replaced by recognition of the value of those activities to the country side and a growing desire for their extension. 2. At the beginning of the year there were 19 Civil Veterinary Hospitals at work. During the year eight more rural dispensaries were opened without incurring additional cost for the district boards, two in Hazara, three in Peshawar, one each in Kohat, Bannu and Dera Ismail Khan ; and in addition 49 touring dispensaries attended once a week by Veterinary Assistants on fixed days have been established in rural areas. During the year under report the staff was increased by the addition of only one Veterinary Assistant Surgeon. The steady building up of a staff efficient both in. quality and number so that hospitals and dispensaries can be properly manned is now a matter of first importance. But in view of the very natural desire both of Government and of the people of the Province that the services of the Province should be manned by men of the Province, it is important to recognise that at present the chief difficulty in this regard facing the Department is the lack of qualified men. This, however, is a defect for which a remedy will it is hoped be provided (though the effect cannot be seen for a year or two) by the fact that we have now got eight men of the Province studying as Government stipendiaries at the Punjab Veterinary College, Lahore, four fresh scholarships of Rs. 30 per month each having been sanctioned during the year under report. It is important that steady provision for the future should continue to be made on these lines. Even so some of the difficulties attending this aspect of the question can be gauged
2 from the fact that one scholar for whom a vacancy had been specially reserved immediately decamped, too late however for his scholarship to be awarded to any one else during that session. It is as well however that the public of the Province should clearly recognise that the choice now lies between creating higher posts now and filling them with outsiders, or waiting a little while till our own men are available with proper qualifications. It is gratifying to note that veterinary activities have now been started in Swat State. 3. At the beginning of the year there were 156 stud bulls working in the Province, to this number 113 have been added, while 39 have been cast, leaving a balance of 230 during the year. These covered 810 cows. Forty-two cows were bought from the Dhanni tract and distri- buted in the Peshawar District with an entertainment subsidy of Rs. 3 per month. Government feels satisfied that the system of importing Dhanni tract animals to improve and if possible replace the local poor animals is on the right lines for the greater part of the Province, with the exception of certain tracts where special hilly conditions produce other requirements. Of 17 buffalo-bulls at stud nine were cast while 17 new ones were purchased leaving a total of 25 at work. They did 1,150 coverings. 4. Castration of bad bulls is the necessary complement to the importation and rearing of good ones, and Government is glad to see recognition of this fact in the increased number of castrations performed3 213 deaths out of 221 animals attacked elsewhere ; it is satis- factory to note that the disease did not appear in Hazara. Altogether Rs. 12,993 was spent on sera and vaccine against Rs 11,000 during the previous year. 6. The report itself gives an account of the main diseases which occurred and of the useful work done in connection with them. Rinderpest caused 180 deaths out of 275 cases occurring. 2,294 inoculations were done in 30 villages. Government is sorry to learn that the most promising form of inoculation (" serum simultaneous ") could not be performed owing to shortage of staff and ignorance of the rural masses. While it is Government's duty to remove the former, it is the duty of the Khans and leading men to remove the latter cause. Government is sorry also to receive in this report confirmation of a melancholy fact already noticed in the Review on the Chemical Examiner's Report, that Hazara has achieved an unpleasant notoriety for cattle poisoning, and hopes that the day is not far distant when public opinion in that district will assert itself, and make this unspeakable form of crime impossible. There were 1,118 cases, with 792 deaths, of hæmorrhagic septicæmia. Of the outbreaks of contagious disease that which strikes the attention most perhaps is the outbreak of anthrax at Kotta, Tahsil Swabi. There were 88 cases among bovines and 40 amongst other animals (including 10 amongst equines)4 importance in constant touring and inspection work. Moreover in a department such as this it is essential that the Superintendent should be in constant touch with district officers and district boards : such co operation is for the mutual benefit of both the Department and the district. 8. Government agrees generally with the remarks contained in paragraph 39 of the report regarding fairs and shows, and hopes that district boards will realise the importance of such. Few district boards perhaps realise that in certain districts of the Punjab the annual fair has become not only one of the most popular and agriculturally useful items of the year, but also ultimately a source of revenue to the district board. 9. On the whole Government finds the year's report very satisfactory and considers that the Department, though it is still in its infancy, and has still far to go, is developing on the right lines.
